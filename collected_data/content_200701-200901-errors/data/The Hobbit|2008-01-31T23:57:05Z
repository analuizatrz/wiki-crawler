'''''The Hobbit, or There and Back Again''''' is a story for children<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/children.jsp |title=Houghton Mifflin - Children's Books |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Auden | first = W.H | authorlink = W.H.

R. R. Tolkien]] in the tradition of the [[fairy tale]]. Tolkien wrote the story in the late 1920s initially to amuse his three sons, and draws on much of the author's professional knowledge of languages, especially [[Old English]] and its associated literature. It was first published on [[September 21]], [[1937]] to wide acclaim. 

''The Hobbit'' is set in a time "between the dawn of Faerie and the Dominion of Men",<ref name="eaton">{{cite news |last=Eaton |first=Anne T. |title=A Delightfully Imaginative Journey |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1938/03/13/movies/LOTR-HOBBIT.html |date=1938-03-13}}</ref> and follows the quest of home-loving Bilbo Baggins (the "Hobbit" of the title) as he leaves his comedic-rustic village and moves into darker, deeper territory<ref>{{cite journal |last=Langford |first=David |authorlink=David Langford |year=2001 |title=Lord of the Royalties |journal=[[SFX magazine]] |url= http://www.ansible.co.uk/sfx/tolkien.html |accessdate= 2007-09-29}}</ref> along with the thirteen dwarves and the wizard Gandalf. Bilbo encounters various denizens of the Wilderland, in order to reach and win his share of the treasure guarded by the dragon, Smaug. By accepting his "[[Took clan|Took]]ish" characteristics (the disreputable, romantic, fey and adventurous side of his family) and utilising both his wits and common sense during the quest, Bilbo develops a new level of maturity, competence and wisdom.<ref name="Matthews">{{cite book | author=Matthews, Dorothy | chapter=The Psychological Journey of Bilbo Baggins |title=A Tolkien Compass |pages=27-40}}</ref>

While ''The Hobbit'' stands in its own right, it is also a prelude to Tolkien's monumental trilogy ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', a sequel requested by the publisher because of ''The Hobbit'''s success and published 17 years later.  ''The Hobbit'' influenced the development of the modern genre of [[Fantasy]] literature,{{Fact|date=January 2008}} and has been republished and adapted many times since its first edition.

==Characters in ''The Hobbit''==

*[[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] [[List of hobbit families#Baggins|Baggins]], the titular protagonist, a respectable, comfort-loving, middle-aged [[hobbit]].
*[[Gandalf]], an itinerant [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] who introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]] and then disappears and reappears at key points in the story.
*[[Thorin Oakenshield]], bombastic head of the company of dwarves and heir to a dwarven kingdom under the [[Lonely Mountain]].
*[[Smaug]], a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarven kingdom of Thorin's grandfather.

The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance, such as the twelve other dwarves of the company; [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elves]]; [[Man (Middle-earth)|men]] (humans); [[Troll (Middle-earth)|trolls]]; [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]]; giant spiders; [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]]; [[Warg]]s (evil wolves); [[Elrond]] the sage; [[Gollum]], a mysterious creature inhabiting an underground lake; [[Beorn]], a man who can assume bear-form; and [[Bard the Bowman]], a heroic archer of [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]].

==Synopsis==
Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin's band of dwarves, who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]] Smaug. When the music ends Gandalf unveils a map showing a [[secret passage|secret door]] into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition's "burglar". The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.

The group travels into the wild, where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to [[Rivendell]]. There Elrond reveals more secrets from the map. Passing over the [[Misty Mountains]], they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Though Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblin tunnels. Groping along lost, he finds a [[one ring|ring]] and then encounters Gollum, who engages him in a game of [[riddles]] with deadly stakes. With the help of the ring (which confers [[invisibility]]), Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, raising his reputation. The goblins and Wargs give chase and the company are saved by eagles before resting in the house of the shape-shifter Beorn. 

The company enter the black forest of [[Mirkwood]] without Gandalf. There Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then from the dungeons of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]]. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travels to the Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing a great cup and learning of a weakness in Smaug's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A noble [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] who overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability reports it to Bard the Bowman, who slays the Dragon.

When the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the prized [[Arkenstone]] gem and hides it. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the Mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town's destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the north, reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but Thorin is intransigent. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.

Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men, and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn is the [[Battle of Five Armies]] won. Thorin, mortally wounded, lives long enough to part from Bilbo as a friend. The treasure is divided fairly, but, having no need or desire for it, Bilbo refuses most of his contracted share. Nevertheless, he returns home with enough to make himself a very wealthy hobbit.

==Concept and creation==
===Writing===
In a [[1955]] letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects that in the early 1930s, when he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]], he began ''The Hobbit'' when he was marking School Certificate papers. He found one blank page. Suddenly inspired he wrote the words "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit." He did not go any further than that at the time, although in the following years he drew up [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Thrór|Thrór's]] map, outlining the geography of the tale.<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|#163}}</ref> By late 1932 he had finished the story and gave it to [[C. S. Lewis]] to read.<ref>{{ME-ref|Bio|p. 181}}</ref> It was eventually published when a family friend and student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths was lent the typescript of the story.<ref name="Letter294">{{ME-ref|Letters|#294}}</ref> When Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall in 1936, a staffmember of the publisher [[Allen & Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]], she either lent Dagnall the book<ref name="Letter294" /> or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien<ref name="Biop184">{{ME-ref|Bio|p. 184}}</ref> (the sources differ). In any event, Miss Dagnall, impressed by it, showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner wrote such an enthusiastic review of the book that it was published by Allen & Unwin.<ref name="Biop184" />

=== Publication ===
[[Image:Hobbit cover.JPG|right|200px|thumb|200px|Dustcover of the first edition of ''The Hobbit''. This cover was taken from a design by Tolkien, as was the binding illustrated at the top of this article.]]
George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' on September 21, 1937. It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by December due to enthusiastic reviews.<ref name="hammond-anderson">{{cite book | last = Hammond | first = Wayne | coauthors = Douglas A. Anderson | title = J. R. R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography | publisher = [[Oak Knoll Press]] | location = New Castle, Delaware | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-938768-42-5 | pages = 15,18,21,48,54}}</ref> Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York prepared an American edition to be released early in 1938 in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937.<ref name="hammond-anderson"/> Despite the book's popularity, wartime conditions forced the London publisher to print small runs of the remaining two printings of the first edition.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

The first printing of the first English language edition can sell for between £6000<ref>''The Hobbit sells for £6000'', bbc.co.uk, 26/11/04[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4045667.stm]</ref>  and £20,000 at auction,<ref>Walne, Toby. ''How to make a killing from first editions'' Daily Telegraph 21/11/2007[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/11/20/cmbook20.xml]</ref> although the price has occasionally reached over £40,000.<ref> ''The Hobbit breaks records at auction'' bbc.co.uk, 12/07/02[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2125802.stm]</ref>

Following the original publication of ''The Hobbit'' in 1937, new [[Edition (books)|editions]] in English were published in 1951, 1966, 1978 and 1995 and the novel has been [[English-language editions of The Hobbit | reprinted frequently by various publishers]]. <ref>Anderson, Douglas A., ed.''The Annotated Hobbit''. Revised Edition. Harper Collins. London, 2003. ISBN 0-00-713726-3. pp. 384-386</ref> In addition, ''The Hobbit'' has been [[Translations of The Hobbit|translated into over forty languages]]. Some languages have seen multiple translations.<ref> Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' p. 23</ref>

====Revisions====
In December 1937, Tolkien's publisher, Stanley Unwin,  asked for a sequel and rejected his drafts for the ''Silmarillion'', believing that the public wanted 'more about hobbits'  the author began work on what would become ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''<ref name="carpenter-tolkien"/> a sequence of events that would not only change the context of the original story but also lead to substantial changes to the character Gollum.

In the first edition of ''The Hobbit'', Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988)</ref> In order to reflect the new concept of the [[One Ring|ring]] and its powerful hold on Gollum Tolkien decided a rewrite of the Gollum encounter in ''The Hobbit'' was in order, and he sent a revised version to his publishers. He heard nothing further for years. When he was sent [[galley proof]]s of a new edition he learned to his surprise the new chapter had been incorporated as the result of a misunderstanding.<ref name="carpenter-tolkien">{{cite book | last = Carpenter | first = Humphrey | authorlink = Humphrey Carpenter | title = J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography | publisher = [[George Allen & Unwin]] | location = London | year = 1977 | oclc = 3046822}}</ref> In ''The Lord of the Rings'' the original version of the riddle-game is explained as a "lie"  made up by Bilbo, and that the revised versions of ''The Hobbit'' contain the "true" version of events.<ref name = "prologue">{{ME-ref|fotr|Prologue}}</ref> This became the second edition, published in 1951 in both the UK and America.<ref name="hammond-anderson"/>

After an unauthorised paperback edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published by Ace in 1965, Houghton Mifflin and Ballantine requested Tolkien to provide a new authorised text of ''The Hobbit'', in order to re-assert US copyright control.<ref>Rateliff, John D ''The History of the Hobbit. Part 2: Return to Bag-End'' p765</ref> This text became the (1966) third edition.  Tolkien took the opportunity to further adjust the narrative to conform with ''The Lord of the Rings'' and to developments in his still unpublished ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' as it stood at that time.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988), Flies and Spiders, note 23</ref>  These minor changes included, for example, that the phrase ''elves that are now called [[Gnome]]s'' appears in the first<ref name="Hobbit first edition">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J. R. R. | title = The Hobbit | publisher = George Allen & Unwin | location = London | year = 1937 | pages = 63}}</ref> and second<ref name="Hobbit second edition">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J. R. R. | title = The Hobbit | publisher = George Allen & Unwin | location = London | year = 1951 | pages = 63}}</ref> editions on page 63. Tolkien had used "Gnome" in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the [[High Elves]] – the [[Noldor]] (or "Deep Elves"). Tolkien thought that "gnome", being derived from the Greek ''gnosis'' (knowledge), was a good name for the wisest of the Elves, but with its common denotation of a [[garden gnome]], Tolkien ultimately replaced the phrase with ''High Elves of the West, my kin'' in the third edition.<ref name="Hobbit third edition">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J. R. R. | title = The Hobbit | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | location = Boston | year = 1966 | pages = 62 | ISBN = 0-395-07122-4}}</ref>

In its current revision, ''The Hobbit'' still retains many differences in tone from ''The Lord of the Rings''. For example, goblins are more often referred to as Orcs in ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988)</ref> Many of the inconsistencies arose because Tolkien wrote the Hobbit as a children's story, the published version having only a loose relationship to his mythological writing, only later strengthening the connections through revisions and through its sequel.<ref name="carpenter-tolkien" /> Moreover, his concept of Middle-earth was to change and evolve throughout his life and writings.<ref>Christopher Tolkien, ''The History of Middle-earth''</ref>

=== Publication of early drafts ===

In May and June 2007, HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin published ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' in the United Kingdom.  Much like ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', ''The History of The Hobbit'' examines in two volumes previously unpublished original drafts of ''The Hobbit'' with extensive commentary by [[John Rateliff]]. In celebration and recognition of the 70th anniversary of ''The Hobbit'', ''The History'' was published in the United States on 21 September 2007, exactly 70 years after the initial publication of Tolkien's work.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

==Style==
The basic form of the story is that of a [[quest]],<ref>W. H. Auden, "The Quest Hero," in Rose A. Zimbardo and Neil D. Isaaca, eds., ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism''. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston, 2004. 31-51. ISBN 0-618-42251-x.</ref> told in [[episode]]s. Tolkien fills the story with a wealth of incidental detail regarding minor characters and distant events, which gives his imaginary world more depth. The narrative voice often addresses the reader directly, a device which the author himself came to dislike. <ref name="Carpenter">{{ME-ref|Biography}}</ref> Nonetheless the direct narrative voice remained when he began to rewrite ''The Hobbit'' in 1966 in order to make a better tonal fit with its sequel. The revision was abandoned at chapter three after Tolkien received criticism that it 'just wasn't ''The Hobbit'''. <ref>Rateliff, John D. ''The History of the Hobbit. Part 2: Return to Bag End.'' p781</ref> The narrative voice contributes significantly to the success of the novel, and lends it to being read aloud.<ref>  ''The Hobbit Major Themes'', Cliff Notes, retrieved (30/01/08)[[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/The-Hobbit-Critical-Essays-Major-Themes.id-171,pageNum-68.html]]</ref>

The novel draws on Tolkien's knowledge of historical languages and early European texts (for example, the names of Gandalf and all but one of the thirteen dwarves were taken directly from the [[Old Norse]] poem "Voluspa" from the [[Elder Edda]])<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/lessons/two/handouts.jsp |title=Tolkien's Middle-earth: Lesson Plans, Unit Two |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> and the illustrations (provided by the author) make use of [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[rune]]s. The story is enhanced with information on calendars and moon phases and detailed geographical descriptions that fit well with the accompanying maps — attention to detail that is also found in Tolkien's later work.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

==Major themes==

The central character, Bilbo, is a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world  because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, whilst those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle-game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to understand each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern is a constant recurring theme throughout ''The Hobbit''.<ref>Shippey, Tom: ''Tolkien: Author of the Century'', HarperCollins, 2000, p.41</ref>

''The Hobbit'' may be read as Tolkien's parable of the [[World War I|First World War]], where the hero is plucked from his rural home, and thrown into a far off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile<ref>Carpenter, Humphrey: ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Review, The Times 2003 [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article1020455.ece ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Review, The Times 2003]</ref> and as such explores the theme of heroism.

The [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] concept of [[individuation]] is reflected through the theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author seen to be contrasting Bilbo's personal growth against the lack of that of the dwarves.<ref name="Matthews" />

Greed plays a central role in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves, or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/notes/hob/TOP1.htm ''The Hobbit'' on Bookrags]</ref>

== Adaptations ==

March 1953 saw the first authorised adaptation — a stage production by [[St. Margaret's School]], [[Edinburgh]].<ref>Anderson, Douglas, ''The Annotated Hobbit'', p.23</ref> Since then ''The Hobbit'' has been adapted for other media many times.

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''[[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)|The Hobbit]]'' [[radio drama]], adapted by [[Michael Kilgarriff]], in eight parts (4 hours) from September to November 1968, which starred [[Anthony Jackson (actor)|Anthony Jackson]] as narrator, [[Paul Daneman]] as Bilbo and [[Heron Carvic]] as Gandalf.

[[Nicol Williamson]]'s abridged reading of the book was released on four [[LP record]]s in 1974 by [[Argo Records (UK)|Argo Records]].

''[[The_Hobbit_%281977_film%29|The Hobbit]]'', an [[animated]] version of the story, produced by [[Rankin/Bass]], debuted as a [[television movie]] in the [[United States]] in 1977.

The American radio theatre company ''The Mind's Eye'' produced an audio adaptation of "The Hobbit" which was released on six one-hour audio cassettes in 1979. 

The [[BBC]] children's television series ''[[Jackanory]]'' presented an adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' in 1979.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Hobbit | series = Jackanory | serieslink = Jackanory}} [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0771799/ Internet Movie Database: ''Jackanory'', "The Hobbit" (1979)]</ref> Unusually for the programme, the adaptation had multiple storytellers. According to one of the narrators [[David Wood]], the release of the production on video has been repeatedly stopped by the [[Tolkien Estate]].<ref>David Woods, website [http://www.stilesanddrewe.co.uk/david_wood_guestbook/guestbook/default.asp?PagePosition=11]</ref>

A three-part comic book adaptation with script by [[Chuck Dixon]] and Sean Deming and illustrated by David Wenzel was published by [[Eclipse Comics]] in 1989. A reprint collected in one volume was released by [[Del Rey Books]] in 2001.

Robert Inglis adapted and performed a one-man [[theatre]] play of ''The Hobbit''. This performance led to him being asked to read/perform the unabridged audiobook for ''The Lord of the Rings'' for Recorded Books in 1990 and a year later he read the unabridged version of ''The Hobbit'' for the same company.<ref>Audiofile Magazine [http://www.audiofilemagazine.com/RobInglis.html] (retrieved 19/01/08)</ref><ref>Photos of a performance during book-week in a school [http://www.elanorahts-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/zipweb/library4.html](retrieved 19/01/08)</ref>

In 2001, Marjo Kuusela produced a ballet ''Hobitti'' (''The Hobbit'' in Finnish) with music by [[Aulis Sallinen]] for the [[Finnish National Opera]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State_3041=2&workId_3041=13303 |title=The Hobbit ('Hobitti'), Op.78, Aulis Sallinen |accessdate=2007-12-02 |publisher=ChesterNovello}}</ref>

In 2004 an operatic version of the story was written and had its world premiere in Canada. The score is currently being revised and will have its American premiere in the Spring of 2008 at the [[Sarasota Opera]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]].

A [[The Hobbit (2010 film)|live-action film version]] was announced on 18 December 2007, to be co-produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and [[New Line Cinema]], and [[Film producer|produced]] by [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Lord of the Rings]] [[Film director|director]] [[Peter Jackson]]. It will be released in 2010, and shot simultaneously with another prequel. A director has not yet been named. On 31st January 2008, reports leaked from a film premiere of The Orphanage in France announced that Guillermo Del Toro would be directing the double-bill. <ref>http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2250245,00.html|</ref> <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Peter Jackson to produce ''The Hobbit''|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/18/film.thehobbit.ap/index.html |work= |publisher= [[CNN]]|date= |accessdate=2007-12-18 }}</ref> ''(See also [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy#Prequels|The Lord of the Rings film trilogy: Prequels]])''

===Games===
''The Hobbit'' has been the subject of several [[board games]]:

[[TSR]] released 2 editions of a wargame based on ''The Battle of Five Armies'', designed by Larry Smith in 1976/1977 using cardboard tokens and a map of the area around the Lonely mountain as a game-area. The game was criticised for a lack of clearness in the rules, and praised for evoking the onslaught of the warg and goblin army.<ref>Easterbrook, Martin, ''Open Box Review'' [[White Dwarf (magazine)]] #3,Oct/Nov 1977 p 15</ref>

''The Lonely Mountain''  (1984, [[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]]),<ref> ''Newsboard'', ''Fellowship Follows'', [[White Dwarf (magazine)]] #57, September, 1984 p45 </ref> designed by Coleman Charlton, features groups of adventurers entering Smaugs Lair to capture his treasure before he awakens.  The same year, the same publisher also published their version of ''The Battle of Five Armies'' <ref>''Newsboard'', ''Fellowship Follows'', [[White Dwarf (magazine)]] #57, September, 1984 p45 </ref> developed by Richard H. Britton, Coleman Charlton, and John Crowell, again a wargame using card counters and a paper map.

Whilst "The Hobbit Adventure Boardgame" was the last Hobbit-specific game to be published by [[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]] in 1997, ICE continued to publish the [[MERP|Middle-earth Role Playing Game]] a game licensed on both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' properties which combined elements from both works, between 1982 and 1999.

[[Games Workshop]] released a ''Battle of Five Armies'' (2005) [[tabletop wargame]], designed by [[Rick Priestley]] using 10mm figures sculpted by Mark Harrison and based on Games Workshops [[Warmaster]] rules.<ref>More information can be found at: [[http://www.specialist-games.com/bofa/whatis.asp Games Worshops Specialist Games site]] </ref>

Several [[Video game|computer and video games]], both official and unofficial, have been based on the story. One of the most successful was ''[[The Hobbit (video game)|The Hobbit]]'', an award winning ([[Golden Joystick]] Award for Strategy Game of the Year 1983)<ref>[[CRASH (magazine)]] #4, p. 43 [[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue04/Pages/Crash0400043.jpg]]</ref> computer game developed in 1982 by Beam Software and published by [[Melbourne House]] for most computers available at the time. By arrangement with publishers, a copy of the novel was included with each game sold.

[[Sierra Entertainment]] published a [[platform game]] titled ''[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|The Hobbit]]'' in 2003 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[personal computer|PCs]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox]], and [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]]. A version, based on the same character design and story, but a 2D isometric platform, was also published for the [[Game Boy Advance]].
