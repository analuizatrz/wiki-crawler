{{nihongo|'''Kurama'''|蔵馬|Kurama}} is a [[fictional character]] in the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[YuYu Hakusho]]'' by [[Yoshihiro Togashi]]. In the human world, Kurama is also known as {{nihongo|'''Shuichi Minamino'''|南野秀一|Minamino Shūichi}}.

Kurama is first encountered in the series at the same time as Hiei. His ability is in manipulating plants, and he generally wields a whip created from a rose vine, complete with thorns. He is one of the wiser characters in the series and the smartest and calmest of the four main characters.

Kurama's [[seiyu|seiyū]] are [[Megumi Ogata]] for his human form, and [[Shigeru Nakahara]] as Yoko Kurama. As there are several US dubs done by different companies, Kurama has had three English voice actors: [[John Burgmeier]] in the [[FUNimation]] version, [[David Hayter|Sean Barker]] in the [[Media Blasters]] dub, and [[Hideo Seaver]] in [[U.S. Manga Corps]]' version.

Note that Kurama generally refers to Kurama in his human form, whereas Kurama in his fox demon form is usually referred to as '''Fox Demon Kurama''' or {{nihongo|'''Yoko Kurama'''|妖狐 蔵馬|Yōko Kurama, literally "Spirit Fox Kurama"}}; the English-language manga uses "Fox Demon Kurama," while the English anime uses "Yoko Kurama."

==Personality==
Kurama is generally regarded as the most calm and level-headed member of the group. His analytical nature is present in battle where he prefers to study the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents before devising a strategy of his own.

He is protective of those he cares about and is often merciless to anyone that poses them a threat, a shift in his usually friendly manner. In many instances, Kurama has shown to be very self-sacrificing in the interests of the safety of his friends and family.

==History==
[[Image:Yoko Kurama.jpg|thumb|right|Fox Demon Kurama/Yoko Kurama]]

Fox Demon Kurama/Yoko Kurama was a cold hearted and ruthless thief and the most feared bandit in [[Makai]]. He was considered to be an A-class demon, and is said to be more than a thousand years old.

After being wounded by a bounty hunter while in his spirit fox form, Kurama sent his spirit into the Ningenkai (human world) where his spirit took refuge within an unborn child that had not yet gained a soul. It was from this point that Kurama made the transfer to a human body with the intention to recover his strength as the child developed. Kurama planned to leave Ningenkai to return to Makai after regaining his strength after an estimated ten years. However, sometime during or before the tenth year, an act of selflessness by his mother, Shiori Minamino, opened Kurama's eyes to pain he had caused his mother while growing up. Thus, he decides to continue living his human life as Shiori's son.

==Spirit Detective Saga==
Kurama is first introduced to the series with [[Hiei (YuYu Hakusho)|Hiei]] and Goki (''Gouki'' in the English anime, ''Goki'' in the English manga). Together they stole three powerful artifacts from Spirit World, which [[Yusuke Urameshi]] has to retrieve as his first assignment as Spirit Detective. Kurama stole the ''Forlorn Hope'', a mirror that has the power to grant its user a wish during the full moon in exchange for their life. Upon meeting Kurama, Yusuke finds out that Kurama has no intention of using the mirror to cause harm, but only wishes to use its power to save his mother from an illness. Later, Kurama aids Yusuke in defeating Hiei, taking a blow from Hiei's sword and blinding Hiei's Jagan Eye with his own blood.

After Yusuke is assigned with Kuwabara to eliminate the four Saint Beasts, Kurama and Hiei join them as reparation for their crimes against Spirit World. Kurama faces off against the stone beast Genbu, and reveals his rose whip for the first time. He is injured in the process but ultimately finds Genbu's weak spot, and then supports the others as they make their way through the castle.

==Dark Tournament Saga==
Kurama joins with the other protagonists to form Team Urameshi when Toguro issues his challenge, and fights increasingly difficult battles. On the ship to the tournament grounds, after the 5th member of Team Urameshi (Genkai in disguise) eliminates all the other competitors in a single blow, he easily defeats the remaining enraged demons that attack him.

Kurama's first fight is against Roto, of team Rokuyokai(Jolly Devil Six in the English Manga). It becomes obvious that he has Roto outclassed when Roto pulls a dirty trick - he reveals that he has a partner that is stalking Kurama's mother, and will kill him when he receives a signal. Kurama realizes that he can do nothing, and takes Roto's attacks. However, he is able to embed a Death Plant seed into Roto's body using a diversion, and paralyzes his opponent. Crushing the transmitter, Kurama then causes the plant to bloom, killing Roto instantly.

After the match, Kurama and Hiei are attacked by a robot constructed by Dr. Ichigaki, hoping to keep them distracted while he fights the other members of Team Urameshi inside the stadium. They easily overpower the attacker, and Kurama rescues the teacher of the three members of Team Ichigaki that fought against Yusuke, Kuwabara, and Genkai.

Due to political maneuvering, the panel decides to go ahead with the next match. A demon named Ruka traps Hiei and Genkai inside a powerful barrier, leaving Kurama, along with Yusuke and Kuwabara to fight the five members of Team Masho. Kurama, as the freshest member of the team, vows to take out as many as he can before he falls, to give Yusuke a chance at winning as Kuwabara was in no condition to fight.

Kurama first squares off against Gama, a demon who fights using paint made out of his own blood. He first causes seals to appear on Kurama's arms and legs, making them extremely heavy and cutting down on his mobility (making him unable to wield his rose whip). Kurama finds a way to win by causing his rose whip to sprout from within his hair, slicing Gama to pieces and therefore winning the match. Gama has one final trick before he dies - he uses his blood to create his most powerful seal, locking in Kurama's spirit energy inside him, leaving him at the mercy of the next fighter to enter the ring: Touya.

Touya easily gains the upper hand but Kurama's skill and prowess in battle allow him to avoid any fatal blows. As a last ditch effort, Kurama places the Death Plant seed inside his own body, to have it feed off of his own spirit energy, an incredibly dangerous move that allows him to surprise Touya and win the match by impaling him on vines that grow from Kurama's arm. Kurama, taxed to the limit, passes out on his feet. The third member of Team Masho, the sadistic Bakken, argues that Kurama is still standing (although unconscious) and the fight begins. Bakken pummels Kurama mercilessly until Yusuke threatens to kill him with a rei-gun blast unless he stops. Kurama is then thrown out of the ring, regaining consciousness near the end of the match.

Before the [[Dark Tournament Saga]], Kurama is unable to revert to his Yoko form. However, while fighting [[List of minor enemies in YuYu Hakusho#Ura Urashima|Ura Urashima]] of Team Uratogi (Fractured Fairy Tales in the English manga), Ura uses an item called The Reverse Treasure Box (Reverse Magic Box in English Manga, Idun Box in the English Dub). The box emits a magical smoke that is supposed to cause the victim to revert to their youth, however, this backfires and transforms Kurama back into his former self, Yoko Kurama. Yoko, completely emotionless and sadistic, threatens to to torture Ura Urashima into telling him the secrets of the box so he can continue to transform, when [[List of minor allies in YuYu Hakusho#Shishiwakamaru|Shishiwakamaru]] breaks the barrier that was keeping the smoke inside the arena. The smoke gone, Yoko transforms back into Kurama, the winner of the match but still obsessed with the secrets of the box.

The last opponent Kurama faces in this tournament is Karasu, a man with an obsessive desire to kill Kurama. Knowing that he cannot defeat Karasu in his human form, Kurama seeks a way to transform himself back into Yoko. [[List of minor allies in YuYu Hakusho#Suzuki|Suzuki]] of Team Uratogi gives Kurama some potion made from the Fruit of the Past Life (from either Spirit World or Demon World, depending upon whether the source is the English or Japanese version) that he used to make the Reverse Treasure Box. After testing it, Kurama finds out that it will make him transform into Yoko, but only for fifteen minutes. Kurama takes some of the potion before his battle with Karasu, but it does not take effect until after he is badly injured. Kurama is able to trap Karasu in his Ojigi Plant, and believes to have defeated him. Unfortunately, Karasu is still alive, and the potion's effect wear off even before the fifteen minutes are over. Karasu manages to severely injure Kurama in his human form, but Kurama unleashes a blood sucking plant on Karasu, an attack that Kurama expected would kill him because it would use up his remaining life energy. However, Kurama does not die due to the fact that each time he drank the potion, the effect does not last as long because he regained some of his original demon strength, and this enabled him to survive. Due to a technicality, he is declared the loser of the match because he was unable to get up before the count was over.

==Chapter Black Saga==
Kurama returns to his normal life after the Tourmanent, when Yusuke is kidnapped by Genkai's students. As always, Kurama is the first one to fight. In the quest to rescue his friend, he faces off in a battle of wits against his school rival, Yuu Kaito, and defeats him to allow passage of the rest of the group.

During the subsequent battles with Sensui, Kurama plays a major role when the group encounters Amanuma(Game Master). Kurama is the first to grasp Sensui's cruelty in using the boy, forcing a choice to either kill Amanuma or let the Gateway open. Kurama informs Amanuma that he will die if he loses, a dirty trick to make his opponent lose his concentration. Kurama wins against Amanuma, but is torn with regret and anger that he was forced to kill the boy (evidenced by him clenching his fists so hard his nails make his palms bleed).

Eager for revenge, when Sensui offers to let Kuwabara go if the group can kill Makihara, Kurama steps forth, silencing Yusuke's protests with icy words and resolve. He decapitates Makihara in a move so brutal and quick that even Hiei is shocked, and then declares that he knows who Makihara is really controlled by. Elder Toguro emerges from the remaining part of Makihara's head, finding great glee in the chance to kill the spirit fox - however, Kurama traps Toguro into eternal damnation in the clutches of the Sinning Tree.

Kurama's anger over Yusuke's death pushes his energy to A class levels, transforming him for the third time into Yoko. However, this transformation is different, as this is the first time that Kurama maintains his human personality. He is able to do little against Sensui, however, and is saved from death when the newly reborn Yusuke arrives.

Between the events of the Chapter Black and the [[Saga of the Three Kings]], Shiori Minamino remarries, and her new husband is Hatanaka, the president at a company where Shiori works. Kurama also gains a new stepbrother, also named Shuichi.<ref>Shuichi's name was changed to '''Kokoda''' in the English dub.</ref>

==Three Kings Saga==
In the [[Saga of the Three Kings]], Kurama is called on by [[Yomi (YuYu Hakusho)|Yomi]], his former partner when he was still a thief in Makai. Kurama's internal struggles become more apparent in this saga because of the three different aspects of himself: Kurama as he is when he fights alongside Yusuke and his companions, Yoko, and the human Shuichi Minamino. At this point wherein he relives most of his past, his Yoko personality is somewhat predominant, as he seems to want to live the life he lost when the bounty hunter shot him. In moments of duress or battle, Kurama (who had yet to fully suppress his Yoko side) would transform into Yoko and his ruthless personality would return, along with an increase in power beyond A class levels.

After the death of Raizen, Yusuke comes to Yomi's territory with a proposition; a new tournament which will determine the ruler of whole Makai. Yomi accepts and the tournament begins. Kurama's team (made up of the surviving members of Teams Masho, Uratogi, and Rokuyokai from the Dark Tournament) qualifies easily in the preliminary round but after the team faces stronger opponents, each member is defeated one by one. Then, Kurama fights Shigure, "The Demon Surgeon." Though Kurama is well into A-class power, he is no match for the S-class Shigure. During a fierce battle, he transforms into an S-class Yoko and easily uses his speed to avoid Shigure, but willfully transforms back into his human self, stating that he will not resort to using Yoko. Despite being weaker than Shigure, he is able to use his spirit energy to cause the large dormant tree they are using as an arena to bloom, having merged it with a cherry tree seed before the fight began. This causes Shigure to lose the match as his weapon gets stripped from him, giving Kurama the win. However, Kurama is unable to continue with the tournament and withdraws due to severe injuries.

After his fight with Shigure, he decides to not look to the past for answers to the future and with his loyalty to his human mother and his friends, he leaves his Yoko lifestyle behind. After the end of the Makai/Demon World Tournament, Kurama goes back to Ningenkai and gets a job at his stepfather's company. He lives like a normal human being from then on alongside Yusuke, Kuwabara, and his other friends--except for Hiei, who decides to continue living in Makai.

==In other media==
===Movies===
Kurama appears in both of the YuYu Hakusho movies, [[YuYu Hakusho: The Movie]] and [[Yu Yu Hakusho, The Movie: Poltergeist Report]].

In [[Yu Yu Hakusho, The Movie: Poltergeist Report]], a character named Kuronue<ref>Kuronue's original Japanese name is Kurobue.</ref> is introduced as the Fox Demon Kurama's former partner in thievery. One of the Netherworld Gods impersonates Kuronue in an attempt to gain the upper hand to defeat Kurama, but Kurama eventually discovers this deceit and kills the Netherworld God.

===Video games===
Kurama appears as a playable character in all of the YuYu Hakusho video games, and he also appears in the game ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] as a playable character.

==Powers and abilities==
Kurama's special ability is that he can turn plants into deadly weapons by manipulating his youki into that plant. Kurama has complete control over any Human Realm plant and has some control over Demon Realm plants. However Demon Fox Kurama has complete control over Demon Realm Plants and has more power than regular Kurama. The strength of Kurama's moves depends on how much aura Kurama uses. He has an incredible sense of smell (evident when he fights Genbu) and he can [[Lip reading|read lips]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Togashi |first= Yoshihiro |title= YuYu Hakusho Volume 14 Chapter 9 |publisher= [[Shueisha]]}}</ref> Though Kurama is considered the second weakest of the four main fighters, topping out at high A-class power by the end of the series (noted by Kuwabara in the final episode when he states that Kurama's power should prevent him from crossing through the Kekkai barrier), he is easily the smartest fighter of the four. He relies on cunning and tactics and not necessarily power to win battles (such as his fights with Touya, Karasu and Shigure).

It is worth noting that out of all the main characters of the series, Kurama is the only one that does not use some sort of external energy manifestation to attack. The exception to this rule is in several franchise video games, where Yoko Kurama can use energy beams as a weapon.

===Transformation===
The mechanics behind Kurama's transformations into Yoko Kurama is not entirely explained in the manga, although there are clues given in the anime, depending on wether one is watching the original Japanese or the English dub. 

One theory sugguests that Kurama's human body transforms into his Yoko form when his energy levels are raised to A-class levels, as a reflex due to the increase in energy. This theory is supported by the Japanese dialogue during the battle with Sensui. When Kurama transforms, he openly speculates to Kuwabara that he most likely transformed due to "the rise of spectral power within me." Another stretch that fans have made supporting this theory is that Kurama planned to return to Makai when his power reached a certain level, assuming he knew that he would transform back into Yoko when his powers attained a certain peak.

The second theory behind these transformations is the exact opposite - that Kurama willingly transforms his body in order to increase his power, The only real evidence for this theory is in the English dub during the same scene with Kuwabara - Kurama mentions "I am not Yoko, I have merely taken on his form while maintaning my human personality."

Regardless of the mechanism behind it, Kurama's human form at the end of the series is only able to obtain high B-class levels, and any further power increase to A-class requires his body to be transformed.

===Techniques/moves===
* {{nihongo|'''Rose Whip/Bara Shibenjin'''|ローズ ウイップ/薔薇棘鞭刃|Rose Thorny Whip-blade}}: With this technique, Kurama uses his aura (yōki) to grow a rose from its seed state to its flowering state and then into a long thorny whip that is capable of cutting even through steel. This weapon was first introduced during Kurama's battle against Genbu of the Four Beasts. This is Kurama's most commonly used weapon.
** {{nihongo|'''Kagon Retsuzanshi'''|華厳裂斬枝|''Splendid Limb-Severing''}} or '''Rose Whiplash''' in the English Dub: Kurama uses this technique against Genbu of the Four Beasts, and it involves swiftly slashing in multiple directions with his whip to destroy Genbu's body.
** '''Fūka Embu Jin'''　in the Japanese version, ''''Rose Whip Thorn Wheel''' in the English Dub, or '''Petal and Thorns''' in the English Manga: This is a defensive technique seen when Kurama fights against Karasu. Kurama uses it to buy time before he transforms into Yoko Kurama under the effect of the potion he took. It is essentially a whirlwind of rose petals hovering around him and if the opponent/attacker gets within a certain range the petals attack and rip them to shreds. 
* {{nihongo|'''Shimaneki Sō'''|死招き草|''Deathbringer Weed''}} or '''Seed of the Death Plant''' in the English dub and "Deadly Vetch" in the Viz translation: This is a small seed that Kurama plants in his opponent's body and can be manipulated using his yōki. After it has had enough time to secure its roots within the victim's body, the Shimaneki can kill the victim. This attack was only used in the Dark Tournament Saga and was first used against Roto of the Jolly Devil Six/Team Rokuyukai, who threatened to kill Kurama's human mother with a messenger Yōkai if Kurama attacked him. Kurama was able to plant the Shimaneki on Roto and fought Roto long enough for the seed to take root. During his match against [[Toya (YuYu Hakusho)|Touya]] of the Team Mashotsukai/Team Masho/Shadow Channelers with his yōki sealed away from a curse brought on from his previous match Kurama was forced to place the seed in his body to use the yoki in his body and was able to use the Shimaneki as a sword-like weapon to render Touya unconscious.
* {{nihongo|'''Shoku Yō Shokubutsu'''|食妖植物|''Devourer Demon Plant''}} or '''Death Tree''' in the English Dub: Used by Yoko Kurama during his match against Reverse Urashima/Ura Urashima of Team Uratogi/Fractured Fairy Tales in the Dark Tournament. This is a giant redwood carnivorous tree with an acidic saliva that strikes anything that moves. Yoko Kurama used this to force Ura to tell him the secret of the Reverse Treasure Box. This would have worked if Ura hadn't been killed by his teammate Shishiwakamaru for trying to give away their secrets.
* {{nihongo|'''Makai Ojigi Sō'''|魔界オジギ草|''Demon Realm Bow Weed''}} or '''Ojigi Plant''' in the English Dub: Used during his match against Karasu this is where Yoko Kurama was able to use this plant to counter Karasu's bombs. This deadly plant is from South America where it responds to movements or flammables by closing its leaves around its prey and crushes it to death. Although this plant managed to bind Karasu, he was able to create an explosion from within destroying this plant.
* {{nihongo|'''Kyūketsu Shokubutsu'''|吸血植物|''Bloodsucking Plant''}}('''Vampire Plant''' in VIZ Media Dub): A blood sucking Demon Realm plant that also was used against Karasu in the Team Toguro Match. When Kurama reverted from his fox demon form to his human form and with his yōki running low, Kurama deliberately placed a Shimaneki seed on Karasu's chest knowing that he would find it so it would expose his blood. Kurama intended to sacrifice himself in this attack to kill Karasu, who thought that Kurama could only control plants from the Human World while in his human form.
* {{nihongo|'''Janenju'''|邪念樹|''Tree of Depravity''}} or '''Sinning Tree''' in the English Dub: This plant was used by Kurama in the Chapter Black Saga in the fight against Gourmet (Sadao Makihara). Knowing that Elder Toguro was now in control of Gourmet's body, Kurama placed this seed on his Rose Whip, which was planted on Gourmet's body when Kurama decapitated him. The tree would send its victim their worst fears until they die, but since Elder Toguro was incapable of dying, it would prey on him forever.
* {{nihongo|'''Juryō Yōzan Ken'''|樹霊妖斬拳|''Wood Spirit Demon Beheading Technique''}} or '''The Binding Fist of the Demonic Vine''' in the English Dub: Used by Yoko Kurama during his battle against Shinobu Sensui. It is similar to the Rose Whip in that it is composed of a vine with thorns, but this time it grows around Kurama's arm and is wielded as a sword-like weapon.
* '''Okunenju Ueki''' (''Okunenju Trees'') or '''Okunenju Roots''' in the English Dub: Used during Kurama's battle against Shigure in the Three Kings Saga to show that using his fox demon form was not his trump card. It involves growing a large tree that overran the entire fighting arena. It resembles a [[Sakura|cherry tree]], reflective of Kurama's memories of climbing the cherry tree in his front yard as a child.
* '''Bamboo Plant''': Not officially named, this plant was used in Yu Yu Hakusho: Poltergeist Report to kill a Netherworld God that had impersonated Kuronue. Its tips are extremely sharp, piercing the body as it grows.
* '''Akaru Zassō''' (''Akaru Weed'') or '''Lamp Weed''' in the English Dub: Kurama used these weeds as markers in the maze-like Irma Cave (Demon Door's Cave in the English Dub) in the Chapter Black Saga. Kurama planted a few of these just before their encounter with Game Master (Tsukihito Amanuma). Koenma was later able to use these to help him find his way to join up with the others to fight Sensui.  
* {{nihongo|'''Fuyōka no Makai Shokubutsu'''|浮葉科の魔界植物|''Floating Leaves from Demon Realm Plant''}} or '''Leaf of a Plant''' in the English Dub: This plant appears as "wings" similar to that of a butterfly on Kurama's back (this is possibly a nod to a particular [[moth]] [[genus]] also called [[Kurama]]). Doubling as a glider, this plant is what Kurama (in his fox demon form) places on his back to aid himself, Kuwabara, and Hiei as they fell from the portal that linked the Human World to the Demon World in the Chapter Black Saga.
