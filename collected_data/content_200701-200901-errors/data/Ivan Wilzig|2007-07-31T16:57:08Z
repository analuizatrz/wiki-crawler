'''"Sir" Ivan Wilzig''' (born c. 1956) is a musician who is best known for [[techno]] remixes of 1960s songs such as "[[Imagine_song|Imagine]]" and "[[San_Francisco_%28Be_Sure_to_Wear_Flowers_in_Your_Hair%29|San Francisco]]".  He is also founder of the nonprofit Peaceman Foundation and appeared as Mr. Mitzvah on Season Two of "[[Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Superhero%3F_%28Season_2%29|Who Wants to be a Superhero?]]"

==Biography==

Ivan Wilzig is the son of the late Siegbert (Siggi) Wilzig, who as a penniless German Holocaust survivor earned a fortune through finance.  (Siegbert Wilzig died in January 2003.)  He grew up in [[Clifton%2C_New_Jersey|Clifton, New Jersey]] with his brother Alan and sister Sherry.

Wilzig began voice lessons as a teenager, but was discouraged by his father, who wanted his son to have a more successful career.

Ivan Wilzig graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, earning a degree in European intellectual history.  He then earned his law degree at the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.  He and his brother, Alan Wilzig, assisted his father in running the Trust Company Bank of New Jersey.  Most of Ivan Wilzig's work at the bank was in public relations and marketing -- Wilzig had tried one year as a corporate lawyer, but hated it.  Wilzig most notable accomplishment at the Trust Company Bank was the brokering of a deal that allowed several bank branches to open up at A&P Supermarkets.

However, in 2000 "Sir Ivan" abandoned his banking career to begin a career in music. (He sat on the board of the Trust Company Bank as of 2001, finally leaving in 2004.)  Wilzig began to release techo remixes of 1960s singles such as "Imagine", "San Francisco" and "Peace on Earth".  He formed the charitable Peaceman Foundation, which gives the proceeds of his records to charity.

==Peaceman and Mr. Mitzvah==

As the spokesman for the Peaceman Foundation, the flamboyant Wilzig began to dress as a caped character named Peaceman.  During the first season of "[[Who Wants to be a Superhero?]]" Wilzig attempted to audition with the producers -- as Peaceman -- but was too late to be included.  He was encouraged to audition for the next season.

His "Peaceman" character made the cut for the second season, but as a precondition, the [[Sci Fi Channel]] and NBC obtain the copyrights to contestant characters.  Wilzig refused to give up the copyright to "Peaceman" and attempted to create a new character "Mitzvah Man", but the name had already been copyrighted.  "Mr. Mitzvah", however, was not copyrighted and Wilzig took on the identity of Mr. Mitzvah for the show.

==Technippy==

Wilzig describes his music as "[[Techno]]" produced tracks with "[[Hippie]]" lyrics. In his own words as "Technippy".

==The Castle==

Synonymous for "Sir" Ivan Wilzig's eccentric and [[hedonistic]] lifestyle is his lavish and "over the top" decorated 14,000 square feet Medieval-style estate in Water Mill on [[Long Island]], [[New York]]. In general referred as the "Castle" it is considered by many entertainment journalists (and by the owner himself) as the "[[Playboy Mansion]] of the East Coast". Although built in the late 1990's the "Castle" has been featured in various television shows, including the [[Travel Channel]]'s "Grand Castles of America".
