"'''Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie'''" is the 6th episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[List of The Simpsons episodes#Season 4 (1992-1993)|fourth season]]. It first aired on [[3 November]] [[1992]]. As punishment for Bart's misbehavior, Homer bans him from seeing the new Itchy & Scratchy movie forever.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
After a Parent Night at Bart's school, Mrs. Krabappel tells Marge how she should discipline Bart more. Homer does, and Bart, after not watching his sister Maggie when he was supposed to, cannot see the new Itchy & Scratchy movie. Bart became very jealous of others who saw the movie,
including Nelson and Milhouse, who then chase Bart together for not seeing the movie. No matter what Bart does (trying to sneak out, pleading, behaving well), Homer refuses and foils it. Despite the fact that Homer feels bad that Bart really does want to see the movie, he believes that if he doesn't make at least some effort to discipline Bart now, he will never become something successful, like [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].

Once the movie moved out of the theaters, Bart concedes defeat to Homer. In [[2032]], Bart is [[Chief Justice of the United States]], and Homer takes him to the Itchy & Scratchy movie, which is on its second billing.

==Cultural references==
*''[[60 Minutes]]'' - Homer's threat of sending Grampa to the "crooked home we saw on ''60 Minutes''" (after he mumbles incoherently following Bart's prank) is a reference to the CBS [[newsmagazine]] and the investigative reports into nursing home abuse that aired on it.
*Various [[James Bond]] films - The scene where Bart pets Snowball II, after melting a toy James Bond mini-figure, is a spoof of [[Blofeld]] stroking his cat in various James Bond films. 
*Simpsons voiceover [[pseudonym]]s - Lisa's remark that [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]] both provided voices for ''The Itchy & Scratchy Movie'', yet were not credited, references previous episodes were the actors provided guest voices using pseudonyms - Hoffman in "[[Lisa's Substitute]];" Jackson in "[[Stark Raving Dad]]" as Sam Etic and John Jay Smith respectively.
*''[[Soylent Green]]'' - Homer's comment, "Mmmmm ... solyent green" (in the flashforward scene where said item is a concession item) is a reference to the 1973 science fiction movie about the synthetic food product named in the title.
*''[[Star Trek]]'' - The endless succession of ''Star Trek'' movies and television shows is spoofed in the opening gag, "Star Trek XII: So Very Tired" (featuring a very elderly [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]] crew).
*''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' - The 1928 "Itchy & Scratchy" short - where Scratchy is burned alive in the steamboat's [[furnace]] at the end of the film) is a spoof of the classic 1928 Disney short, which served as the debut for [[Mickey Mouse]].
* [[Where's the beef?]] - Homer's [[bumper sticker]] contained the mid-1980s [[Wendy's]] advertising slogan, which became a national [[catchphrase]].
*''[[TV Guide]]'' - Homer recalls reading ''TV Guide'' to Lisa. "Eight o'clock, ''[[Happy Days]]''. The [[Fonzie|Fonz]] ([[Henry Winkler]]), is worried he is losing his cool."
*[[World War II]] cartoons - Itchy & Scratchy slaughter [[Adolf Hitler]] with help from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]].
*[[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] - [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justices]] mentioned in this episode are [[John Marshall]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], [[Warren Burger]] and [[Earl Warren]].
*[[The Ohio Express]] - Homer is listening to "[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]" instead of watching the [[moon landing]].
*[[Academy Award]]s - The Itchy & Scratchy Movie won nine Academy Awards.
*[[Tennessee Williams]] - Lisa describes Bart as having "the demented [[melancholy]] of a Tennessee Williams heroine".
*''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' - Homer and Bart are silhouetted against the movie screen in a similar fashion to the show's cast.
*''[[The Godfather]]'' - After Marge says that [[Earl Warren]] wasn't a stripper, Homer says "Now who's being naive?". This is similar to [[Michael Corleone]]'s quote in [[The Godfather]] when he says "Now who's being naive, Kay?".

==Trivia==
*The headlights of Homer's car blink when he honks the car's horn.
*In 2032, the "Do not sell to this boy" poster is still hanging there, though it isn't drawn very well.
*Originally, the Itchy and Scratchy movie was supposed to be shown as the most violent, twisted cartoon ever, but the writers changed it to be just an ordinary episode of Itchy and Scratchy.
*Bart is briefly seen reading a [[novelization]] of ''Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie'' by [[Norman Mailer]].
* When Lisa says, "You wouldn't believe all the celebrities who had cameos! Dustin Hoffman! Michael Jackson! Of course, they didn't use their real names, but you could tell it was them!", she is subtly referencing the actual appearances of Hoffman, under the fake name 'Sam Etic' in "Lisa's Substitute" and  Jackson, under 'John Jay Smith' in "Stark Raving Dad".
* When Homer calls Bart "the boy you love to hate", it may be a possible reference to rapper [[Ice Cube]], who was popular at the time the episode originally aired and was known as "the nigga you love to hate".
*This episode originally aired in [[North America]] on a [[Tuesday]], rather than the usual Thursday, as part of a comedy lineup on Fox, while the other three major networks were broadcasting the presidential election results.
