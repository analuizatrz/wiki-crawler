==Music video==
[[Image:UnderneathItAllVideo.png|right|thumb|Gwen Stefani removing her coat in the video.]]

The song's [[music video]] was directed by [[Sophie Muller]] and directing collaborative Logan.<ref name="video">[http://mvwire.com/dynamic/article_view.asp?AID=10236 "Interview with Music Video Directors Sophie Muller & Logan"].  MVWire.  Retrieved [[August 22]], [[2007]].</ref> It opens with a sequence of Stefani, as shown on the cover of the [[CD single]], removing several pieces of clothing and later lying on a bed.  After a scene with her in front of a white heart with roses, bassist [[Tony Kanal]] and drummer [[Adrian Young]] play [[basketball]] while Stefani stands against the wall.  Stefani is then shown against a sparkling sky, followed by a scene of the whole band [[bicycling]] during Lady Saw's toast.  The video closes with a scene of Stefani jumping on a bed in white undergarments and without makeup.

Muller wanted to add more sexual themes to the look of the video to contrast with the innocence of the song's lyrics.  The original idea for the video was to show Stefani with heavy makeup "really over done like a stripper" and have her remove her clothing throughout the video.  Muller found that this complicated the video too much, so each sequence shows Stefani with progressively less makeup instead.  Muller decided to use a color scheme with bright colors such as orange, lime green, and pink, and the contrast was increased using Symphony in [[post-production]].  The bicycling scene was to originally show footage that the band shot while recording in Jamaica since Stefani wanted to include a Jamaican theme.  Instead, the scene was created by filming the individual band members on a twelve-foot turntable in front of a [[bluescreen]].  Tracks were used to shoot two members riding next to each other, and Logan used [[computer-generated imagery]] to show the entire band bicycling in Jamaica.<ref name="video"/>

The music video was successful on video channels.  It debuted on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]'' [[October 7]], [[2002]] at number seven.<ref name="trl">[http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=debuts "The TRL Archive - Debuts"].  ATRL.
