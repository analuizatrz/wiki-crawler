'''Bughouse Chess''' (also called sometimes '''Exchange Chess''', '''Tag Team Chess''', '''Double Chess''', '''Siamese Chess''', '''Double Bug''', '''Tandem Chess''', '''Transfer Chess''', or simply '''[[Bughouse]]''') is a [[chess variant]] played with two teams of two people with two chess boards playing in collaboration against each other.  It is far more complex than normal chess.  It seems to have developed independently in numerous places at numerous times.

== Rules ==

Team members sit beside each other playing opposite colors.  Each player plays his opponent as in a standard chess game except that when pieces are captured they are given to the teammate.  The teammate can then decide to place the captured piece almost anywhere on the board in place of a regular move (as in [[shogi]]).  Team members have to work together, and (sometimes) against a clock, to win.  The game may be scored in either of two ways, depending on prior agreement:

* 1.The first mate or overtime (when using clocks) decides the match. 
* 2.The first mate or overtime (when using clocks) does not decide the match, and play continues on the remaining board. Captives in hand may still be dropped, but there is no way to acquire new captives. Once the remaining game is completed, points are counted as follows: 1 for a win, 1/2 for a draw, and 0 for a loss. The team with the most points wins. If teams score 1-1, the match is a draw. 

It should be noted that a mate by a line piece does ''not'' end the game even if the player has no pieces to drop, because he may acquire some later. (line piece: a unit which guards a line or lines, typically a Queen, Rook or Bishop)

The only restriction on dropping pieces in Bughouse is that pawns can't be dropped on the 1st or 8th rank.

Though opinions vary about this, it is generally accepted that at least some form of discussion between teammates is allowed. Any Bughouse variant allows players to ask their partners to capture a specific piece for them, so shouts like "Gimme a knight!" are common, leading to seemingly-absurd sacrificial captures on the other board if it will lead to mate or a devastating fork on the board of the player who yelled "Gimme a knight!"

=== Variations ===

==== Tandem chess ====

In Tandem Chess, one cannot place pieces to check or to mate, nor can one place pawns on one's 1st, 7th or 8th ranks. Also, the match continues until both games are completed.

==== Transfer chess ====

In Transfer chess, a piece added to the board can not be used to block or make check, it can be placed in any empty square on your half of the board. The objective of the game is to capture and hold all the kings. The game is won when one team has all four kings on the board, the treasure chest (slang for the pieces you have been given from the other game) may not have two kings in it at any time (between teams.)

==== Siamese chess ====

Bughouse can be played by two players in the following arrangement. Player A assumes a team and player B the other; A begins by moving a white piece, B replies by moving a black piece followed by a white piece, A replies by moving a white piece followed by a black piece, etc. This variation is suitable to play [[correspondence chess|by mail]]. A different arrangement is to play the moves counter-clockwise, as described below.

This arrangement can also work with more than two players, i.e. three players on three boards or five players on five boards, moving counter-clockwise (assuming the board with the white pieces is on the player's right hand.) Every player plays on two boards (moving black first, then white) pieces captured from one board can be dropped on the other. Once all games are done the player with the most points win.

=== Chess clocks ===

Bughouse chess usually use chess clocks to prevent players from waiting indefinitely for a piece (waiting for pieces is considered perfectly acceptable).
In untimed games, a gentleman's rule is that a player may not delay his move beyond the time that it takes for his partner to make three moves. This rule is not necessary in timed games.

== Where to play ==

Today there are Bughouse tournaments sponsored by major chess organizations, but most Bughouse games occur during regular chess events. Chess online is primarily run by [[FICS]] and the [[Internet_Chess_Club|Internet Chess Club]].

It is popular at Birmingham Checkmate, a club founded by former British Grandmaster [[Mike Fox]], in [[Quinton]], [[Birmingham]].

== Tournaments ==
There is a House Exchange competition played at [[King Edward VI Five Ways School]] in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], with a slightly different format. Each house has a team of 4, and two of the four are selected for the opening game. The game is played as above, but when a player loses, he is out for the remainder of the match. The third player on his team is substituted in, and both boards are reset. The game continues in the same way, until eventually a house can no longer field a team due to not having anyone left to take place. I.e. in a four player team, three games need to be won. It uses the time variations explained below.
There is big international chess festival [[Czech Open]] and every year big tournament in bughouse chess is played in July. See [http://www.czechopen.net/ CzechOpen.net]

== Time Variations ==
Although Bughouse is often played with [[chess clock]]s, rules for playing without clocks exist as well. In one such variant, if a player is deemed to be taking too long, or waiting indefinitely, the player who thinks his opponent is wasting time can declare "Stalling", and then count from 1 to 10 in approximately one-second increments. When the player gets to 10, he may remove a piece of least value from his opponents board, and resume counting from 1. If you ever have a Mate-in-one, to prevent deliberate time wasting, you declare "Death Count" and count to 10 in the same way as stalling. These rules avoid the necessity of clocks, and generally add to the chaotic appearance of the game, and make it more enjoyable to play.
