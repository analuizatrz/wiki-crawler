The '''Air Training Corps''' ('''ATC''') is a cadet organisation based in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a voluntary youth group which is part of the [[Air Cadet Organisation]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). It is supported by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], with a currently serving regular RAF Officer, currently [[Gordon Moulds|Air Commodore Gordon Moulds]],<ref>{{Citation

}}</ref> and, although a number of its members do go on to join the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] or other services, the ATC is not set up as a recruiting organisation. The enrolment age for the Air Training Corps is 13 years and 3 months, however cadets can join at the age of 13, and enter as Junior Cadets. When the cadet reaches the age of 18 they become Instructor Cadets and are subjected to the same regulations as adult members of staff (including [[duty of care]] responsibilities). Cadets need to leave by their 20th birthday, when they become eligible to be instructors.(see [[Air Training Corps#Membership|membership]]).

==Aims and motto==

The Aims of the Air Training Corps are: 
*To promote and encourage among young men and women a practical interest in [[aviation]] and the [[Royal Air Force]]. 
*To provide training which will be useful both in the Services and civilian life.
*To foster the spirit of [[adventure]].
*To develop qualities of [[leadership]] and good [[citizenship]].<ref>{{Citation

==The cadet promise==

Upon enrolment into the ATC, each and every cadet has to make the following promise, usually at a ceremony presided over by the Unit Padre or Commanding Officer, and by signing the promise in their Cadet Record of Service Book (RAF Form 3822):

:"I Cadet *Name*, hereby solemnly promise on my honour to serve my Unit loyally and to be faithful to my obligations as a member of the Air Training Corps. I further promise to be a good citizen and to do my duty to God and the Queen, my Country and my Flag."<ref>{{Citation

}}</ref> He was the son of a [[major general]] and joined the [[British Army|army]] himself as a regular officer. After service attached to the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], he joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (the forerunner of the Royal Air Force) where he served as a pilot in the [[World War I]]. 

He transferred to the Royal Air Force in [[1919]] and eventually retired from service in [[1929]].
His love of aviation and his tremendous capacity for hard work was such that, following his retirement, he became the Secretary-General of the [[Air League]]<ref>Sir John Adrian Chamier, 2003. http://www.oswaldmosley.com/people/chamier.html [Accessed] [[2007-01-17]]</ref> - an organisation made up of people who could see a bright future for aviation and who wanted to make the British public aware of its potential. 

Against a background of rising interest in aviation and with the clouds of war beginning to form over Europe, Air Commodore Chamier thought of the idea of starting an aviation cadet corps.
He knew that in the [[World War I|1914-1918 war]], in desperate moments, hand picked young men with only a few hours of training were sent to do combat in the air - only to fall victim to well trained enemy aviators. He knew also that the winning of air power would need the services of many highly skilled and highly trained men using the best equipment and that the sooner such training could be started the better.<ref>[[#note-0|1]]</ref>

===Air Defence Cadet Corps===
{{Main|Air Defence Cadet Corps}}

The '''Air Defence Cadet Corps''' (ADCC) was set up in 1938 by Air Commodore Chamier.

Its purpose was to train young men in various aviation related skills. These skills were eventually destined to be used by RAF and Fleet Air Arm.

The corps was extremely popular with thousands joining up all eager to help Britain prepare for [[World War II]].

In 1941, in order to provide the means of giving part-time air training to young men destined for the Royal Air Force, the ADCC was formally established as the [[Air Training Corps]] by Royal Warrant. The ATC still continues today training young people in all types of life skills.

===The Air Training Corps is Established===
Towards the end of [[1940]] the government realised the true value of the work done by the ADCC and agreed to take over its control. This meant a number of changes to the corps, and in fact brought about the birth of a completely new organisation, called the Air Training Corps. So on the [[5 February]] [[1941]] the Air Training Corps (ATC) was officially established, with [[King George VI]] very kindly agreeing to be the Air Commodore-in-Chief, and issuing a [[Royal Warrant]] setting out the Corps' aims.

The number of young men responding to this new ATC was spectacular. Within the first month the size of the old ADCC had virtually doubled to more than 400 squadrons and after 12 months it was about 8 times as big. The new ATC badge was designed and, once approved by the King, it was published in August 1941. The motto VENTURE ADVENTURE, devised by Air Commodore Chamier, was adopted by the ATC and incorporated into the badge.

The new ATC squadrons adapted their training programmes to prepare young men for entry to the RAF. Squadrons arranged visits to RAF and Fleet Air Arm stations as part of the cadets' training and to let them fly as much as possible. Everybody wanted to fly but, with so few flights available, many cadets were disappointed. One solution designed to get cadets airborne was to introduce them to [[gliding]]. This would give cadets a chance to get the feel of an aircraft in flight and allow them to handle the controls. This obviously could not happen overnight. It would be many years before this dream could be realised.

==Organisation==
Within the Corps there are four levels of command. From top, down, they are: Corps, Region, Wing and Squadron. The Squadrons are the focal point for the majority of members of the Corps.

===National level===
The ATC is the largest part of the [[Air Cadet Organisation]] ('''ACO'''), along with the RAF sections of the [[Combined Cadet Force]]. It is divided geographically into six regions (each commanded by an RAF [[Group Captain]]), each of which are sub-divided into [[wing (air force unit)|wings]]. There are currently 36 wings, most named after the one or two counties that they operate in. Wings are divided into four areas and further sub-divided into [[squadron]]s.  

Headquarters Air Cadets (HQAC), based at [[RAF Cranwell]], controls the organisation; and there are subordinate HQs at Region and Wing levels staffed by officers of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve|RAF Reserve]] and civil servants. A regular RAF [[Air Commodore]] serves as [[Commandant Air Cadets]]. The Current Commandant Air Cadets is [[Gordon Moulds|Air Commodore Gordon Moulds]]. The Chief of Staff is a retired [[Group Captain]] in the RAF Reserves. The current Chief of Staff is Group Captain Evans. 

The ACO forms one of the seven functional areas of [[No 22 Group RAF|No 22 (Training) Group Royal Air Force]], which is responsible for the recruitment and selection of all RAF personnel and for the policy and delivery of RAF non-operational training (including Flying Training). No 22 Group is led by the [[Air Officer Commanding No 22 Group RAF]], currently Air Vice-Marshal R F Garwood.

Two ''Air Cadet National Adventure Training Centres'' are controlled by HQAC - at [[Llanbedr|Llanbedr, Gwynedd]], Wales and [[Windermere, Cumbria]], England. These provide a range of adventure training courses and accommodation for squadron and wing expeditions. HQAC also controls 28 [[Volunteer Gliding Squadron]]s around the UK, through the Air Cadet Central Gliding School at [[RAF Syerston]].

===Local level===
ATC Squadrons are established in most large towns in the UK and there are also units in [[Cyprus]], [[Germany]], [[Gibraltar]] and [[the Channel Islands]]. In recent years, there have always been 926 squadrons. The first 50 squadrons formed have their squadron numbers followed by an F to show they are ''founder'' squadrons. Only 30 are still in existence, as the other 20 have disbanded over time.

In towns not large enough to sustain a squadron of 30 cadets, or as a suplement to an existing squadron in larger towns/cities, a Detached Flight (DF) may be formed. This operates much like any other unit, but is technically a component part of a nearby larger squadron. The establishment of [[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] and cadet NCOs ([[Non-Commissioned Officer]]s) is dependent on the size of the Squadron or DF. There are approximately 48 Detached Flights currently in being.

Each squadron is usually commanded by a [[RAFVR(T)]] Officer (although this is not always possible - 213 (City of Rochester) is an example of a squadron run by a Warrant Officer<ref>http://www.hornets.org.uk/officers.htm 213 (City of Rochester) Officers</ref>). The Officer Commanding (or OC) has a good deal of autonomy in running the unit but also carries heavy responsibilities. Additionally where a unit has other members of staff the OC allocates their duties and also provides recommendation on appointment, retention and promotion of those staff.

Another member of the adult staff with a lot of responsibility within a unit is the Squadron Warrant Officer (Sqn WO). This person will hold the rank of [[Warrant Officer]] and will have typically have spent many years working within the squadron or at least within the ATC.
In the case of no commissioned officers being present, the SWO will take charge of the unit. At all other times, the SWO will usually hold a closer relationship with the cadets than the OC will.

This basic structure has many permutations - varying numbers of cadets and staff, accommodation and facilities. A typical Detached Flight consists of the Officer Commanding and a minimum of fifteen cadets and is often housed in rented accommodation.
At the other extreme a large Squadron can consist of 120 plus cadets, 4 commissioned officers, 2 non-commissioned officers and a half dozen Civilian Instructors.

==Structure==

The Air Training Corps is formed of six Regions across the United Kingdom and each of these Regions are made up of six Wings.

===Squadrons===
''See [[List of Air Training Corps squadrons]]''

==Membership==
===Junior Cadets===

People aged 13 to 13 and three months, the official joining age, and those who are not yet enrolled, are given the title 'Junior Cadet' (formerly 'Probationer') as they can go along to most meetings to get a feel for the ATC, but cannot participate in most activities off squadron. They do not normally need to pay subscription fees, as they would not receive uniform. Junior Cadets can not go on camps or fly with the ATC.

===Cadets===

Young people can join the ATC at any time between the ages of 13 and 19. Cadets can stay in the corps up until age 20 and prior to mid May 2007 must have reached the rank of Cadet Sergeant by age 18 to be eligible to remain in the Corps after this age (the requirement to have reached a specific rank by age 18 was revoked in mid-late May 2007 after the policy had been in place for some 3 1/2 years). Those who stay on beyond 18 are termed Instructor Cadets. All cadets are issued with uniform and must each pay a small amount in [[subscriptions]] (or 'subs' as they are commonly known), usually around £50 per year. The subscription money covers parts of the activities undertaken by the Cadets for example Adventure training, local camps etc. Each squadron also has to pay a fixed amount to the wing to which it belongs for each cadet 'on its books'. Activities such as target shooting (both air rifles and live ammunition), flying and gliding are paid for by the [[Royal Air Force]]

====Promotion====

The cadets of a squadron all join as probationers, becoming second class cadets when they are enrolled. As they become more experienced, and if suitable they (cadets) can be promoted by their Squadron's Officer Commanding (OC) to the status of Cadet [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]]. Promotion to the ranks of Corporal to Flight Sergeant are based on merit and leadership potential. There are no exams to be taken as promotion to these ranks is determined by the Commanding Officer of the squadron. Promotion to Cadet Warrant Officer is decided by a panel at Wing level. Prospective candidates will be a Flight Sergeant, preferably holding the Staff Cadet classification and will be required to attend an interview at Wing HQ. Cadets who reached the rank of Cadet Warrant Officer were formerly allowed to remain an Air Cadet until they were 22 years old, however all cadet service now ends at age 20, regardless of rank. <!--statement on official ACO website stating CWOs may stay until 22 is out of date! -->

====Cadet ranks====

The NCO ranks within the ATC mirror those of the RAF and are '''Cadet Corporal''', '''Cadet Sergeant''', '''Cadet Flight Sergeant''' and '''Cadet Warrant Officer''' ('''CWO'''). It is common within the ATC to abbreviate these ranks by dropping the prefix "Cadet", except for Cadet Warrant Officers, where the title is usually either given in full, as the abbreviation "CWO" or occasionally just as "Warrant". It should be noted that there aren't actually any Cadet Warrant Officers in the ATC, as over 18 year old cadets are classified as Instructor Cadets, and an ATC cadet must be over 18 to be appointed as a CWO, therefore the correct rank is actually Instructor Cadet Warrant Officer (ICWO). However, the three letter abbreviation is by far the most commonly used. 

Promotion to the ranks of Corporal and Sergeant is at the discretion of the squadron's Commanding Officer. To obtain the rank of Cadet Flight Sergeant or Cadet Warrant Officer the candidate has a promotion interview by the Officer Commanding of the wing (Wing Commander), his deputy or the Wing Staff Officer (WSO) of that area. The rank of Cadet Warrant Officer also requires a cadet to be over 18 and hold the staff cadet classification. This also means that it is outside of the Squadron OC's authority to demote CWOs or Flight Sergeants. Unlike Warrant Officers in the Regular British Armed Forces, CWOs are addressed by their rank, rather than "''Sir''" (or "''Ma'am''").

====Instructor Cadets====

All cadets who are over the age of 18 have the prefix "Instructor Cadet" before their rank. These Cadets now wear a rank slide with the words 'INSTRUCTOR CADET' embroidered below their rank insignia (provided they are the rank of cadet sergeant or above), although corporals, cadets and some SNCOs still wear the old insignia - a white band attached to the rank slide. An instructor cadet has extra responsibilities over under-18 year olds which include a duty of care to the younger Cadets and NCOs. Instructor Cadets are required to attend training to aid them in their transition from 'child' to 'adult'.

Nevertheless, instructor cadets have no authority over cadets below the age of 18 holding the same or a more senior rank. This has been the source of much debate within the ATC.

====Cadet classifications====

Not all cadets who join the ATC can expect to receive promotion. However, all cadets can progress through the training system and, by passing exams, achieve different classifications. The classification levels are '''Second Class Cadet''' (commonly known as a 'basic'; this is automatically achieved on enrolment), '''First Class Cadet''', '''Leading Cadet''', '''Senior Cadet''' and '''Staff Cadet'''. For each of these qualifications cadets study a variety of subjects including [[airmanship]], [[navigation]], [[first aid]], [[telecommunications|communications]], [[principles of flight]], [[airframe]]s and [[Air propulsion|propulsion]]. These subjects are studied using tuition from the instructors, and self-study from Air Cadet Publications or ('ACPs'). Each successive qualification allows a cadet greater participation. For example, cadets must be First Class before they can take part in some activities such as UK annual camps, while Leading Cadets can participate in overseas activities. Cadets who have achieved the Staff Cadet classification have completed their academic training and can attain a [[BTEC]] Award in Aviation Studies. Staff cadets wear a yellow [[lanyard]] over the left shoulder, and are allowed to teach other cadets. Cadets over the age of 17 and of the rank of at least Cadet [[Sergeant]] can complete a leadership course called Junior Leaders, which swaps the yellow Staff Cadet [[lanyard]] with a maroon one on completion.

====Other awards====

Cadets can also qualify for various other [[BTEC]] awards through the training that is carried out at their squadrons. There are many additional courses and awards that can be gained such as Nijmegen Vierdaagse Marches Medal.
BTEC Award in Aviation Studies - equivalent to 1 GCSE A-C grade (administered by HQ Air Cadets). 
BTEC First Diploma in Public Services - equivalent to 4 GCSEs A-C grades (administered by CVQO).
BTEC First Diploma in Music - equivalent to 4 GCSEs A-C grades (administered by CVQO).
BTEC Certificate in Aviation Studies - equivalent to 2 GCSEs A-C grades (administered by HQ Air Cadets)
ILM Certificate in Team Leading - Level 2 (administered by CVQO)

===Adult staff===
The staff who run the ATC at unit level come in 3 types: commissioned officers, adult senior NCOs and civilian instructors.

Officers are commissioned into the [[RAF VR(T)|Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)]]  Unless an officer has previous service, he or she is commissioned as an Officer Cadet, being promoted to Pilot Officer on completion of the Officers Initial Course at [[RAF Cranwell]]. Promotion to Flying Officer normally occurs after two years. Former regular commissioned officers usually start at Flying Officer, subject to certain conditions. After 9 years commissioned service, or upon becoming [[Officer Commanding]] of a squadron and completing a Senior Officers Course, the rank of Flight Lieutenant (acting paid) is bestowed. Squadrons are usually commanded by Flight Lieutenants, who are also found as Wing and Regional staff officers along with Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders. Particularly large squadrons are sometimes commanded by Squadron Leaders.

Adults may also be appointed as senior NCOs, these being ranks within the ATC so unlike the officers they are not directly part of the RAF. Adult NCOs are uniformed in the same way as their RAF counterparts with two exceptions: a small gilt ''ATC'' badge is worn on the rank badge and Warrant Officers (unless they have previous regular warranted service) wear a different rank badge. The ranks of Adult SNCO's are written as Sgt (ATC), FS (ATC) and WO (ATC).

Civilian Instructors, known as CIs, play an important role in training cadets and, in many ways, are the 'backbone' of the Squadron. Unlike Adult NCOs and Officers, CIs do not wear uniform and do not form part of the chain of command in the squadron. However, out of respect, they are still referred to as ''Sir'' or ''Ma'am'' by cadets.

===Civilian committee===
For each level of command there is an associated '''Civilian Committee'''. There is a minimum of 5 members to any '''"Civ Com"''', and there must be a [[chairman]], [[treasurer]] and [[secretary]] as well as the [[Commanding officer|CO]] (an ex-officio member) and someone to take "minutes". The Civ Com is responsible for overseeing the initial unit formation and direction. The committees, consisting of respected members of the community often including parents of cadets and retired staff, also manage finances (in particular [[fund raising]]) but do not have any executive authority.

The ATC is a [[charitable organisation]]. The Royal Air Force provides funds for a few of the key activities such as flying training. These finances are known as 'public funds'. The great range of other activities offered by the ATC however are financed from 'non-public fund'. Here the Civilian Committees come into their own in their tireless effort to seek the necessary financial assistance, by way of fund-raising, which allows these other activities to take place.

Events organised by Civilian Committees to raise money can be:
* Cadets packing bags for money at the local supermarket
* General 'spare change' collections at local events

Squadrons are "charities excepted from registration". This means they enjoy all of the legal benefits of a registered charity without the burden of registration.

==Activities==
Within the framework of the training programme ATC cadets have the opportunity of taking part in many activities. On most Squadrons the only compulsory activities in the ATC year are attendance at various [[church]] parades, usually ATC Sunday (to celebrate the founding of the Air Training Corps on [[5 February]] [[1941]], see below) and [[Remembrance Sunday]]. Many wings also insist that attending Wing Parade is compulsory.

===Parade nights===
Every squadron meets or parades during the evening, twice a week. Parade nights always begin and end with a [[parade]]. First parade is usually used as an opportunity for uniform inspection and to instruct cadets on the evening's activities, while final parade is usually used as an opportunity to inform cadets of upcoming events that they may wish (or may be required) to take part in. On some squadrons subsidiaries 'subs' are paid on a per-parade night basis. On other squadrons, subs are paid monthly either in person or by automated standing order. Subs vary from squadron to squadron and are set by the civilian committee in consultation with the squadron's Commanding Officer and other staff. Each night's activities, between first and final parade, are normally structured into two sessions with a break in between. The activities are normally pre-planned and range from lessons to drill including aviation type activities including aero-modelling, radios and map reading - some squadrons have physical training. Some nights are used for Fieldcraft training or exercises - sometimes colloquially referred to as 'greens nights'.
[[Image:Grob Tutor 5AEF.jpg|thumb|250px|right|One of the [[Grob Tutor]] aircraft used by [[Air Experience Flight]]s.]]

===Flying===
Cadets from both the Air Training Corps and CCF are offered opportunities to fly in light aircraft, gliders as well as other RAF and civil aircraft.
Cadets can take part in regular flights in the [[Grob G 115|Grob Tutor]] at one of 12 [[Air Experience Flight]]s (AEFs) around the UK. These flights typically last 30 minutes; as part of a structured syllabus of training it is usual for the cadet to be offered the chance of flying the aircraft or of experiencing [[aerobatics]]. The staff are all qualified service pilots, usually serving or retired RAF officers. Prior to the introduction of the Tutor, AEFs were equipped with [[Scottish Aviation Bulldog|Bulldogs]] as a temporary measure following the retirement of the [[De Havilland Chipmunk|Chipmunk]] in [[1996]]. The Chipmunk was introduced in [[1957]] and during its service flew many thousands of cadets. Prior to the Chipmunk and established AEFs, cadet flying was a more [[ad-hoc]] affair, although during the [[1940s]] and [[1950s]], [[Airspeed Oxford]]s and [[Avro Anson]]s were used specifically to fly cadets. Cadets were most often used to manually pump the landing gear up or down when flying in the Ansons. Some Cadets who stand out from the rest may also get the opportunity to fly on a civil airliner or go on an overseas flight in an RAF Tri-Star, VC10 or Hercules. A few cadets have also had the opportunity to fly in a variety of other aircraft including fast jets and the Red Arrows.
In general, every cadet will be given opportunities to fly during their time as an active member of an ATC or CCF squadron.

===Gliding===
Cadets can also undertake elementary flying training at a [[Volunteer Gliding Squadron]] (VGS) in [[Air Cadet]] Gliders. The staff are all qualified service gliding instructors, usually made up of a mixture of regulars, reservists and Civilian Instructors. 

Gliding initially consists of three one day Gliding Induction Courses, GIC 1,2 & 3. Each GIC consists of learning about controlling the aircraft in one of the three axes of flight. GIC 1 is pitch, GIC 2 is roll and GIC 3 is yaw and a demonstration of stalled flight. 
A VGS will either fly the winch-launched [[Grob Viking|Viking T Mk1]] glider or the [[Grob Vigilant|Vigilant T Mk1]] self-launched motorglider.

At age 16 onwards, cadets can apply for gliding scholarships through their squadron staff. If selected, the cadet will receive up to 40 instructional launches on the Viking conventional glider (although if the student is close to solo standard it is not unusual for this limit to be exceeded), or up to 8 hours of tuition on the Vigilant motor glider. Cadets who successfully complete either of these programmes will be awarded blue wings. Cadets who show the required aptitude and ability may go on to perform a solo flight and be awarded silver wings. Further training is available to a select few cadets who show potential to progress onto Advanced Gliding Training (AGT) where on completion they are awarded gold wings. Usually these cadets will be enrolled as Flight Staff Cadets (FSCs) and further training to instructor categories is possible.

[[Image:Glider Launch.jpg|thumb|250px|right|One of the [[Grob Viking|Viking T Mk1]] used by the [[Volunteer Gliding Squadron|VGS Squadrons]].]]

A FSC can achieve a Grade 2 award, which recognises them as a competent solo pilot, a Grade 1 award, allowing them to carry passengers in the air and perform the basic teaching tasks involved in the GIC courses, a C category instructors rating which is a probationary instructor who is qualified to teach the Gliding Scholarship course, and possibly a B category instructors rating which allows them to perform the duties of a 'B cat' explained below, with the exception that they cannot perform the role of duty instructor (DI) who is in control of the days flying and decisions for the time that they are in that role.

Once a cadet reaches 20 years of age, he can no longer be a FSC and must become a Civilian (Gliding) Instructor, CGI, (although a FSC has this option at age 18) or a commissioned officer. Once either of these adult statuses has been gained, 'B cat' and 'A cat' is possible. B cats can carry out AGT flying training. An A cat is able to send first solos, whereas a B cat can only send subsequent solos. Both can perform SCT (Staff Continuation Training) to keep other members of staff well trained and current in their flying categories.

===Marksmanship===

Cadets at all levels of the Air Training Corps have the opportunity to participate in the sport of rifle shooting. Since the ATC was originally a recruiting organisation for the Royal Air Force it made good sense for marksmanship to be on the training syllabus. Shooting remains one of the most popular cadet activities.
Cadets have the opportunity of firing a variety of [[rifle]]s on firing ranges. Cadets first train with and fire either the [[Lee-Enfield#.22 Training Rifles|Lee-Enfield No.8]] [[22 Long Rifle|.22]] rifle or .177 [[air rifles]]. They can then progress to the [[L98A1]] CGP, a manually operated variant of the 5.56 mm [[L85A1]]. The 7.62 mm [[Parker Hale]] [[L81A2]] Cadet Target Rifle is also used at long ranges for competition shooting. Although safety has always been the main concern when shooting, with everything done by the book, recent years have seen the introduction of a wider range of training courses for staff involved in shooting to improve quality and safety even further. There are many competitions, from postal smallbore competitions to the yearly Inter-Service Cadet Rifle Meet at [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|Bisley]], the home of UK shooting.
There are currently four types of marksman award that a cadet can achieve, ranging from "Squadron Marksman" - which although is the lowest marksman is not necessarily the easiest to obtain as 4 groupings are required, through "Wing Marksman" and "Region Marksman", to "Corps Marksman". To achieve these awards the cadet needs to undergo a special shooting "marksman" practice and then achieve a high enough qualifying score depending on the award specified.
The Top 100 Cadets in the Bisley competition are awarded with the prestigious "Cadet 100" marksman award

===Drill===
[[Image:Rememberance Day Ripon.JPG|thumb|150px|ATC and [[Army Cadet Force|ACF]] cadets at a [[Remembrance Day|Remembrance Sunday]] parade.]] 
The Air Cadets, as a military youth organization, sets itself and its members very high standards, including dress and behaviour. [[Parade (military)| Drill]] (marching) is a vital part of encouraging teamwork. When a group of twenty cadets walk on to a drill square they are all individuals, but as soon as a session of drill begins the cadets become a team following the orders given by one person. Instead of twenty individual feet hitting the ground, there is only one bang this is result of practise and teamwork. All ATC squadrons practise drill as a means of instilling discipline and teamwork, it is also used in formal  [[parade]]s, for moving around military bases and moving cadets in a smart and orderly fashion. There are also drill competitions comprising of: inter-Sqn, Inter-wing and inter Region competitions. Air cadet drill is taken from Air Cadet Publication 19 (ACP19) which is based on the RAF drill manual (AP818). The task of instructing drill is usually delegated to a SNCO (ATC), however more often than not, Cadet NCOs will assume this responsibility.

Cadets participate in various forms of drill, some of which include:-

Static Drill 

Basic Drill - Quick & Slow Time 

Banner Drill 

Ceremonial Parades 

Band Drill 
Drill & discipline is the responsibility of the AWO or NCOs on a squadron. Once a cadet has gained a few years experience and has attained NCO rank, the cadet will pass on his knowledge and experience to other cadets such as instructing cadets how to participate in a drill squad, taking charge of a drill squad or flight or even taking a major part in ceremonial drill such as a Standard Bearer at Remembrance Day Parades.

===Adventure Training===

Adventure Training forms an essential part of the Air Cadet's training syllabus. As well as helping cadets forge new friendships, adventure training enables all cadets to show off their leadership qualities. Within the ATC there are many opportunities to take part in adventure training, such as hill walking, canoeing/kayaking, walking/camping and camouflage & concealment expeditions. All activities of this kind are supervised by appropriately qualified staff (Mountain Leader for Hill walking, [[British Canoe Union]] (BCU) instructors for canoeing). There are also nationally run courses such as Parachuting, Basic Winter Training and Nordic Skiing to name a few. Adventure training can take place as part of regular squadron parade nights, weekend and week-long centers. There are also two national ATC adventure training camps. NACATC (National Air Cadet Adventure Training Center) Llanbedr in Snowdonia and NACATC Windemere in the Lake District. Here cadets stay for a week participating in various activities in adventure training.
There is a wide ranging Adventure Training syllabus in the ACO - depending on the squadron you attend, you could try your hand at watersports, skiing.

====Climbing====
Climbing is a highly rewarding sport which exercise all parts of your body, by developing upper body strength through gripping, and encouraging muscular development in the legs through balancing. It also helps boost self confidence and trust amongst a team within a fun environment. Many squadrons go on climbing trips regularly - a few even have their own climbing walls. All climbing is supervised by professionally qualified instructors (either staff members or employed from the outside.)

===Fieldcraft===
Fieldcraft is an exciting part of any squadron's training programme, and the promise of a good exercise is always guaranteed to get good attendance. Fieldcraft is, to put it simply, the art of living and moving in the field. Although the ACO is generally focused on different activities, fieldcraft does play a part in most Squadron's training programmes.

Fieldcraft is taught from a single manual, common to all squadrons, so the basic lessons are very similar across the ATC, however 'Consolidated Practical Training' (CPT) and full exercises differ greatly depending on local resources, staffing and skill levels. Exercises and CPT place emphasis on different aspects of fieldcraft - some might need you and your team to move slowly and quietly, sneaking upon an 'enemy' installation, whilst others need speed as well as stealth, and will require a decision on how much of one to trade off against another. 

A generally acknowledged advantage of fieldcraft exercises is that it forces people to use their initiative much more often. A relatively junior member of the Squadron could find themself in a decision-making position. Fieldcraft is often used by squadrons as a method of assessing cadets' leadership qualities, as it forces cadets to make quick decisions and to effectively lead a team, even if they're unsure of exactly what is going on or what they're supposed to be doing.

===Sport===
Sport plays a key part in the activities of every squadron. Seven sports are played competitively between squadrons. Cadets who show talent can be selected to represent their Wing, Region or the Corps in competitive matches; these cadets are awarded wing, regional or corps 'Blues'. The main sports played are:
* [[Rugby Union]]
* [[Field Hockey|Hockey]]
* [[Netball]]
* [[Association Football]]
* [[Swimming]]
* [[Athletics (track and field)|Athletics]]
* [[Cross-country running]]
* [[Orienteering]]
Other sports are also played, sometimes in matches between squadrons, including [[volleyball]], [[five-a-side football]], [[table tennis]], etc. Cadets also use various sports to take part in the physical recreation section of [[the Duke of Edinburgh's Award]]. [[Orienteering]] in the ATC only came about in 2006 where cadets from the different wings go to the cadet orienteering championships.

===Duke of Edinburgh's Award===
The Air Training Corps is the single largest operating authority of [[the Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] system and celebrates its 50th year of providing this opportunity to its cadets in [[2006]].
The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme is a voluntary, non-competitive programme of practical, cultural and adventurous activities for young people aged 14-25.
The Award programme consists of three levels, Bronze, Silver and Gold. Each have differing criteria for entry and the level of achievement necessary to complete each award.
Air Cadets who meet the age criteria can join the award scheme. 

Each award is broken down into 4 areas (5 for gold) which participants must complete successfully to receive their award. These are:- 

'''Service'''<br />
Helping others in the local community. 

'''Expeditions'''<br /> 
Training for, and planning of a journey. 

'''Skills'''<br /> 
Demonstrate ability in almost any hobby, skill or interest 

'''Physical Recreation'''<br /> 
Sport, dance and fitness. 

'''Residential Project''' (Gold Award only)<br />
A purposeful enterprise with young people not previously known to the participant. 

Cadets are often encouraged to achieve the Bronze, Silver and Gold awards as they progress through their cadet careers. Some cadets aged 16 or over used to be able to participate in the Duke of Edinburgh's [[Millennium Volunteers]] Award, this has now been overtaken by another authority and it is currently being reviewed on whether or not cadets will be able to undertake it as it has a new structure.

The Award is widely recognised by employers as it helps demonstrate that award holders are keen to take on new challenges, have a higher level of self confidence than their counterparts, have leadership qualities with the added experience of teamwork.

===Communications===
An extensive range of communication training is offered where appropriately skilled instructors and equipment are available. This can range from hand-held radio [[Voice procedure|operating procedures]] to networked [[digital]] [[Telecommunication|communication]], and even encompasses publishing online (such as this Wiki).

The Provisional Radio Operator Certificate is the first step and has been part of the curriculum since [[2000]]. Cadets are then encouraged to pursue this training across a range of mediums and technology. Once a sufficiently broad spectrum of skills have been mastered and validated by the ''Wing Communications Officer'' the cadet is awarded the Communicator Badge to be worn on the [[brassard]].
Communication training provides valuable practical lessons in information handling and management, develops interpersonal skills and meets one of the Corps' prime objectives: 'providing training useful in both civilian and military life'.

===Community volunteering===
Cadets often volunteer to help at various national and local events. For their services a small payment is usually offered to their squadron's funds. Typical examples of such work includes car parking duties at events and delivering copies of [[Gateway Magazine (Royal Air Force)|Gateway Magazine]] to RAF married quarters.

The largest example of cadets involved in volunteer work is at the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]], an annual air display held at [[RAF Fairford]]. Each year several hundred air cadets volunteer to stay on the base in temporary accommodation. During the course of the event they help with duties such as selling programmes, crowd control and clearing litter.

===Band===

Members of squadron bands are entitled to wear specific badges:

A drummer's badge is a drum in [[white metal]], displayed in the middle of the brassard. 

[[Image:ATC Band York.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An ATC Band]]
A [[piper]]'s badge depicts a set of pipes in white metal, again displayed in the middle of the brassard. 

A trumpeter's badge depicts two crossed trumpets in white metal, displayed in the middle of the brassard. 

An instrumentalist's badge, is a bell lyre in white metal, displayed in the middle of the brassard. An instrumentalist could play one or more of many instruments.

A drum/pipe major's badge, composed of four downward pointing chevrons, surmounted by either a drum or pipes respectively.

For Regional and National Bands only, the optional dress for formal band duties is No 1 HD.

The picture shows 110 (City of York) ATC Squadron's band celebrating the 66th anniversary of the formation of the Air Training Corps. They led a parade around York Minster, then were present in a church service celebrating the formation.

===First Aid===
It has been recommended recently that all cadets should undertake the [[St John Ambulance]] Young First Aider course. This can be provided by individual squadron units, or by the wings and regions. The course can be completed over a weekend, or over a series of parade nights. Either way, the course is assessed by a practical exam, where cadets have to deal with three situations: a conscious, breathing casualty; an unconscious, breathing casualty; and an unconscious non-breathing casualty, involving [[CPR]] on a [[Resusci Anne]] manakin.

A series of first aid topics are covered during the course such as fainting, bleeding, head injuries and bites and stings. These are taught by qualified staff, often qualified to the level of First Aid at Work.

==Annual Camps==

The ATC runs numerous Annual camps each year, run on RAF Stations so that cadets may get a taste of service life. Annual camps are organised at Wing level with place for all squadrons, so that every cadet who wishes to take part and who has achieved at least the '''First Class''' qualification may attend. Cadets usually stay in RAF barrack blocks and eat in the station's [[mess]] facilities. The itinerary is always packed with typical ATC activities such as air experience flying, shooting, adventure training and, of course, drill. Cadets will also have the opportunity to visit various sections of the station and meet the people who work there.

===Overseas Camps===
For older and more experienced cadets who have achieved the '''Leading Cadet''' qualification and attended a UK Annual Camp, the corps also offers overseas camps. These are more expensive than UK camps, as the cost of flights has to be paid for, and are generally more relaxed and seen as a reward for hard working and long serving cadets. Since the end of the [[Cold War]], and the closure of RAF stations in Germany, the number of overseas camp opportunities has decreased. As of [[2007]] the destinations for overseas camps are:

* [[RAF Akrotiri|Akrotiri]] on [[Cyprus]]. A two week camp over the [[Easter]] [[school]] holiday period and at select other times of the year.
* [[RAF Gibraltar]] in [[Gibraltar]].
* JHQ [[Rheindahlen]] in [[Germany]]
*[[USAF Rammstein]] in [[Germany]] 
* Jersey 7 (over seas) squadron

===Work Experience Camps===
Another - newly introduced - option for more senior cadets are Work Experience Camps - whilst annual camps aim to give cadets a general taste of service life, the Work Experience Camps cater to cadets who are interested in a specific trade, such as the RAF Regiment or RAF Police.

===Band Camps===
There are also band camps, which is where a cadet of musical proficiency applies to go on this camp and are selected depending on the musical skill (grades) and their other qualities. The Band Camps are held at RAF College Cranwell, HQ of the ATC.

===Other Camps===
Cadets may also have the opportunity to attend other sorts of annual camp, such as a locally (i.e. wing or squadron) organised camp - often based around Adventure Training or Fieldcraft, or as guests on a camp run by one of the other cadet forces such as the [[ACF]] or [[SCC]].

==Ensign==
[[Image:Ensign of the Air Training Corps.svg|thumb|right|130px|The Air Training Corps Ensign]]
On many squadrons, the Air Training Corps Ensign is hoisted every parade night, (usually in the warmer, lighter nights in the summer months), whereas others will only hoist it on special occasions such as parades and visits from senior Officers. The ensign is taken down at dusk and if rain begins to fall. It is treated with the same respect and dignity afforded to the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]].

==Uniform==
Cadets and staff of the ATC wear uniform similar to that worn by regular members of the Royal Air Force. This is issued free of charge by the supply squadron at a local RAF station, which in the case of cadets comes via their squadron's stores. Cadets and Adult NCOs are then entitled to free replacements as needed.

For normal duties, cadets wear a version of the RAF No 2c uniform (as worn by RAF Airmen in technical trades), with the No 2a uniform (with a light blue "wedgewood" shirt and tie) for formal occasions. Cadet Warrant Officers, Lord Lieutenant's Cadets and members of [[Air_Training_Corps#Activities#Band|ATC bands]] may wear RAF Other Ranks No 1 SD uniform on certain occasions. Cadets never wear the RAF No 2b uniform (short sleeve wedgewood shirt and no tie). For field training, shooting, and other appropriate activities, cadets wear a version of the RAF No 3 uniform, otherwise known as Operational Clothing or Combat Soldier 95 (CS 95), and colloquially known as [[DPM]], Greens or Cabbage Kit.

Uniformed staff wear the appropriate uniform for their rank in the regular RAF - they are distinguished by gilt pins on their rank slides (No 2 or 3 dress) or lapels (No 1 or 5 dress), with the designation "ATC" for NCOs and "VRT" for commissioned officers. Officers are issued with No 2a and No 2b uniform on initial kitting and No 1 SD after their Initial Officers' Course at RAFC Cranwell. They may also source No 3 (Operational Clothing) uniform and No5 (Mess Dress) uniform privately for appropriate occasions. Adult NCOs are issued with No 2a and No 2b uniform on initial kitting and may source No 1, No 3 and No 5 privately.

Cadets' version of the No 2c uniform, known as "working blues", consists of:
* RAF working blue shirt, worn open necked, without a tie;
* RAF No 2 Dress trousers (male cadets), RAF No 2 dress skirts or slacks (female cadets);
* RAF Blue-grey belt with a polished brass/staybrite buckle (male cadets), optional RAF Purse Belt (female cadets) ; 
* RAF jumper, onto which is sewn the highest Duke of Edinburgh's Award badge achieved (right shoulder patch) and flying and gliding "wings" (left shoulder patch);
* RAF [[Beret]] with ATC cap badge (a white metal badge comprising a falcon surrounded by the words "Air Training Corps");
* A [[brassard]], which is worn by all cadets on the right arm, and includes the Air Training Corps distinguishing badge, squadron number, classification badge and most other proficiency badges;
* Black leather shoes (ideally RAF pattern or similar) are required but not issued;
* Cadets may also wear a lanyard; yellow for those who have completed staff cadet training, or maroon for those who have completed the Junior Leaders course. Only one is worn, and the maroon lanyard takes priority (i.e. a staff cadet who has completed Junior Leaders would wear only a maroon lanyard)
* Cadet NCOs wear the appropriate rank slides on the epaulettes of their jumper;
* Lord Lieutenant's cadets wear a separate brassard with distinguishing badge and sqn number on the left arm during time in office.

A similar uniform is worn by cadets of the [[CCF]] ([[RAF]]) sections, except with the RAF cap badge in place of the ATC one.

At any time during the year (but most commonly done in the summer for comfort), the officer commanding a unit may authorise "shirt-sleeve order", which is the same as Working Blues except for that the jumper is removed and sleeves smartly rolled up to just above the elbow. Brassards, lanyards and rank slides are transferred to the shirt, but Duke of Edinburgh's Award and flying badges are not worn.

Cadets' version of the No 2a uniform, known as "wedgwoods" or (confusingly, and incorrectly, as) "No 1s", is the same as working blues, except for that the working blue shirt is replaced by an RAF [[Wedgwood]] blue shirt, which is worn with an RAF black tie (tied in a [[Windsor knot]]). If short-sleeve order is issued in wedgwoods, the sleeves are not rolled up.

Cadets are sometimes permitted to wear the RAF Pattern [[Stable Belt]] when in shirt-sleeve order, but only in No 2a (wedgwood), not No 2c (Working).

Cadets' version of the No 3 uniform, known as "[[Disruptive Pattern Material]] (DPM)" or "Greens", consists of:
*DPM Shirt.
*DPM Jacket.
*DPM trousers.
*Issued [[Beret]] with ATC cap badge. 
*Black leather combat boots.
*2inch Belt (either [[Olive Green]] belt or RAF Stable Belt)

As DPM uniform has only recently started to be issued to cadets, and privately sourced uniform is still being worn by most, the wearing of DPM uniform across the ATC is far from standardised. Recent guidelines encourage the wearing of the union flag, "Air Cadets" patch ("Royal Air Force" patch for Officers) and RAF pattern stable belt by Cadets and Staff. Officers may also wear the RAF tactical recognition flash (TRF).

Uniformed staff may wear No 2a or No 2b uniform for normal duties, with or without a jumper. They do not wear a brassard. Male and Female Officers wear their No 1 SD Cap (issued) or a Forage Cap (purchased privately), Male and Female NCOs wear a beret (issued) or a Forage Cap (purchased privately). Each wear the cap badge appropriate to their rank in the regular RAF. On formal occasions staff will generally wear No1 SD uniform, with a peaked cap, and will wear No 3 uniform (with a beret for Officers as well as NCOs) as appropriate.
