The '''West Island Colleges''' are a set of private [[Canada|Canadian]] [[junior high]] and [[high school]]s, one of which is located in [[Montreal]]'s [[West Island]], and the other in the south-east of [[Calgary]]. The schools also offer a program known as [[Class Afloat]] that provides students with an educational experience while sailing all over the world.

==History==
The College was founded in 1974 by Terry D. Davies in [[Pointe-Claire]], [[Quebec]], located on the West Island of Montreal.  The Montreal campus has since moved to Dollard des Ormeaux.

The College again expanded its offerings with the addition of the Class Afloat program. Class Afloat is a co-educational sailing program that provides high school credit to students while living aboard a tall ship. Students may sail for one or two semesters during which time they learn seamanship and work as crew members while taking high school classes with teachers on board. Port programs in the cities visited provide the students with an opportunity to meet and interact with other cultures, giving them an international perspective on their education. Class Afloat has taken place, since its founding, on the S.V. Concordia. 

The ship operates with a full complement of professional crew, administration, teachers and students. It sails a different route every year and it has circumnavigated the globe many times. In 2008-2009, it is crossing the Atlantic three times, sailing through Northern and Western Europe, South America, Western and Southern Africa, and the Caribbean before finishing the year in Nova Scotia. 

==West Island College - Montreal==
West Island College Montreal is located at 851 Tecumseh, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec, Canada.

==West Island College - Calgary==
West Island College Calgary is located at 7410 Blackfoot Trail SE, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  Recently, the Society of West Island College acquired the property adjacent to the school, formerly that of Andres Wine.  The College has since turned it into an Annexe to house new facilities such as the Hall of Nations, a new library, a new Art Room, Drama Room, Music Room, Multimedia Room, Gym, and Theatre facilities.
