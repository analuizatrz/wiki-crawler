'''Henry N. Beard''' (born probably in 1945) is an American humorist, one of the founders of the ''[[National Lampoon]]'' and the author of several best-selling books.

==Biography==
Beard, a great-grandson of Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]], was born into a well-off family and grew up at the Westbury Hotel on East 69th Street in [[Manhattan]].  His relationship with his parents was cool, to judge by his quip "I never saw my mother up close."  

He attended the [[Taft School]], where he was a leader at the humor magazine, and he decided to become a humorous writer after reading ''[[Catch-22]]''.  

He then went to [[Harvard University]] (from which he graduated in 1967<ref>{{cite web | last = Gideonse | date = March 23, 1995 | first = Theodore K. | title = Sex in the 90s: A How-to Guide | work = The Harvard Crimson | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=497118 | accessdate = 2007-10-25}}</ref>) and joined its humor magazine, the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'', which circulated nationally.  Much of the credit for the Lampoon's success during the mid 1960s is given to Beard and [[Douglas Kenney]], who was in the class a year after Beard's.<ref name=Karp>{{cite book  | last = Karp | first = Josh | year = 2006 | title = A Futile and Stupid Gesture: How Doug Kenney and ''National Lampoon'' Changed Comedy Forever | publisher = Chicago Review Press | pages = 29â€“30 | id = ISBN 978-1-55652-602-2}}</ref><ref name=Lovenheim87>{{cite news | last = Lovenheim | first = Barbara | date = Nov. 29, 1987 | title = Satirist Tees Off on New Target, Golf | work = The New York Times | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D6163CF93AA15752C1A961948260 | accessdate = 2007-10-26}}</ref>  In 1968, Beard and Kenney wrote the successful parody ''[[Bored of the Rings]]''.  

In 1969, Beard, Kenney and [[Robert Hoffman|Rob Hoffman]] became the founding editors of the magazine ''[[National Lampoon]]'', which reached a circulation of over 1,000,000 in the early 1970s.  One of Beard's short stories published there, "The Last Recall", was included in the 1973 ''Best Detective Stories of the Year''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hubin | first = Allan J.

In 1975 the three founders cashed in on a buy-out agreement for ''National Lampoon''; Beard got US$2.8 million and left the magazine.<ref name=Hendra/><ref>Karp ''op. cit.,'' p. 224</ref>  After an "unhappy" attempt at screenwriting, he turned to writing humorous books.<ref name=Karp372>Karp ''op. cit.,'' p. 372</ref>  Those that have reached the [[New York Times Best Seller list]] are ''Sailing: A Sailor's Dictionary'' (1981, with [[Roy McKie]]),<ref>{{cite news | title = Paperback Best Sellers: MASS MARKET | date = January 24, 1982 | publisher = The New York Times}}</ref> ''Miss Piggy's Guide to Life'' (1981),<ref>{{cite news | title = Paperback Best Sellers: FICTION | date = January 24, 1982 | publisher = The New York Times}}</ref> ''Leslie Nielsen's Stupid Little Golf Book'' (1995, with [[Leslie Nielsen]]),<ref>{{cite web | work = The New York Times | title = Paperback Best Sellers: July 2, 1995 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3D61E3AF931A35754C0A963958260 | accessdate = 2007-10-26}}</ref> ''French for Cats'' (1992, with [[John Boswell (publishing-business figure)|John Boswell]]),<ref>{{cite web | work = The New York Times | title = Best Sellers: April 12, 1992 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D9123BF931A25757C0A964958260 | accessdate = 2007-10-26}}</ref> and ''O.J.'s Legal Pad'' (1995, with John Boswell and [[Ron Barrett]]).<ref>{{cite web | work = The New York Times | title = Paperback Best Sellers: July 23, 1995 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4D91F3AF930A15754C0A963958260 | accessdate = 2007-10-26}}</ref>  Other notable books include ''[[Latin for All Occasions]]'' (1990) and ''The Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook'' (1992, with [[Christopher Cerf]]).

==Personal life==
The ''[[New York Times]]'' has described Beard as "enigmatic".<ref>{{cite news | last = Heffernan | first = Virginia | title = Funny Business | work = The New York Times | date = October 15, 2006 | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/books/review/Heffernan.t.html | accessdate = 2007-10-25}}</ref>

Among the enigmas, apparently, is his birthdate.  Not even the year of his birth appears in the in the Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication data of his books or in various Web and print sources.  However, Josh Karp's biography of Doug Kenney says that Beard was "a nearly thirty-year-old man" when he left the ''National Lampoon'' on March 18, 1975<ref>Karp ''op. cit.,'' p. 246</ref> and an article published on November 29, 1987, gives his age as 42.<ref name=Lovenheim87/>  The birth year given above, 1945, is based on these two statements.

According to Josh Karp, Beard is remembered from his Harvard years as patrician but not obsessed with the appearance or cleanliness of his clothes, misanthropic but not malicious, with a mind that understood and could organize any subject, a gifted student who occasionally wrote parodic papers.  He was prematurely mature and the ''Harvard Lampoon'''s arbiter.  As a comic writer he excelled at parody, and his hero was [[S. J. Perelman]].  All these characteristics meant that he was an excellent working partner with Kenney, who was flamboyant, fond of poses, and given to seeing humor where others recoiled.<ref name=Karp/>

Many of these characteristics, not just the clothes, continued into Beard's ''National Lampoon'' years.  The comedy writer [[Chris Miller (writer)|Chris Miller]] remembers that Beard "knew everything" and, on leaving the ''Lampoon'', said that he was sick of being the father to all the writers.  (Beard would have been about 30.)<ref name=Miller>{{cite web | last = Miller | first = Chris | date = 2006-12-27 | authorlink = Chris Miller (writer) | title = An Exclusive Skinterview with Chris Miller | work = Mr Skin - Celebrating Nudity in Film! | url = http://www.mrskin.com/Skinterviews/161/Chris_Miller.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-25}}</ref>  The comic writer and actor [[Tony Hendra]] says that at the beginning of Beard's tenure, he was painfully shy but the magazine's authority over what material was used.  In the next few years, he went through "the greening of Beard", growing his hair, switching from cheap beer to good whiskey, and in 1974, forming a relationship with the writer [[Gwyneth Cravens]].<ref name=Hendra/><ref>Karp ''op. cit.'', p. 201</ref>

In 1991, an article in a reliable publication said that Beard and Cravens divided their time between Manhattan and a renovated boat shed in [[East Hampton]] and  referred to them as partners.<ref>{{cite news | last = Lovenheim | first = Barbara | date = June 30, 1991 | title = Keen Observation Pays Off for Author | work = The New York Times | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DF1730F933A05755C0A967958260 | accessdate = 2007-10-25}}</ref>  A 2006 interview in a different publication said that Beard and Cravens had married.<ref name=Miller/>  Also in 2006, Karp wrote that "reportedly" the couple had added California to their list of addresses and that Beard played golf almost daily but never kept score.<ref name=Karp372/>
