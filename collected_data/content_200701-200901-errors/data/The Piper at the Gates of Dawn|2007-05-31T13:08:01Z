'''''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn''''' is [[Pink Floyd]]'s debut album and the only one made under [[Syd Barrett]]'s leadership, although he made some contributions to the follow-up, ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]''. It has been regarded as one of the most influential LPs ever made, being a tremendous influence on the [[psychedelic rock]] scene of the time, and much of what followed. The album has whimsical lyrics about [[space]], [[scarecrow]]s, [[gnome]]s, [[bicycle]]s and [[fairytale]]s, along with [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] passages. 

== Background ==
In January 1967 prior to recording ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'', the band had produced at sound techniques studio in [[London]], a single entitled "[[Arnold Layne]]". The single was later released in March of that year and reached #20 in the British charts. Also in January the band had recorded a 16 Minute version of "Interstellar Overdrive" and an improvised jam called "[[Nicks Boogie]]", for [[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]]s documentary film ''[[Tonite Let's All Make Love in London]]''. (The latter track wasn't released until 1995 on the ''[[London '66-'67]]'' CD). The bands live show consisted of mainly instrumental numbers and blues covers, however they had started to introduce songs which were written primarily by lead [[Guitarist]] and [[Lead Vocalist]], [[Syd Barrett]].

==Recording history==
Recording of the album began in February 1967 in studio three of [[Abbey Road Studios]] at the same time [[The Beatles]] were recording ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. The album was produced by [[Norman Smith]], an [[EMI]] staff member who had previously engineered all of The Beatles recordings up to 1965s ''[[Rubber Soul]]''. Smith would go on to produce Pink Floyd's follow up album, ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]''. "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]" and "[[Matilda Mother]]" were two of the first tracks recorded, as the latter was viewed as a potential single. "Interstellar Overdrive"s kinetic and spacey production, came from the insistence of the normally conservative Norman Smith, whose work on the record is often criticised because it is seen that he tried to make the album more pop orientated. At some point during the album's creation, [[Nick Mason]] recalled that they were "ushered" into studio 2 where The Beatles were recording "[[Lovely Rita]]". Several conflicting views surround how efficiently the [[recording]] of the album actually went. In his book ''[[Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd]]'', Nick Mason recalled that the sessions went smoothly and that the whole process was extremely efficient. Norman Smith however, condemned both the albums recording and the band members musical ablities. Smith would later state that the sessions were "sheer hell". However, both "[[The Gnome]]" and "[[The Scarecrow (Pink Floyd song)|The Scarecrow]]" were recorded in one take. Unlike subsequent Pink Floyd albums, Roger Waters contribution to Piper is minimal, with the song "[[Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk]]" being his sole writing credit. Indeed a large proportion of the album is credited solely to Barrett, with tracks such as "[[Bike (song)|Bike]]" having been written in late 1966 before the album was even started.

==Album cover and title==
[http://www.vicsingh.co.uk/pinkfloyd.htm Vic Singh] photographed and designed the album cover, unlike subsequent Pink Floyd albums. The album remains one of the few to actually feature the band members. The album's title comes from the title of the seventh chapter of [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s ''[[Wind in the Willows|The Wind in the Willows]]'', where Water Rat and Mole, while searching for a lost animal, have a spiritual experience. ''"This is the place of my song-dream, the place the music played to me," whispered the Rat, as if in a trance. "Here, in this holy place, here if anywhere, surely we shall find Him!"''. The ''Piper'' referred to is the Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. The title was later referenced by [[Stevie Wonder]] in the song "Power Flower" from the 1979 album ''[[Journey through the Secret Life of Plants]]'' ("Fire and air, earth water I prepare/I am the piper at the gates of dawning").

==Release history==
The [[gramophone record|LP]] (with a [[monaural]] mix) was released on [[August 5]], [[1967]], and one month later it was released in [[Stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] mix. It reached #6 on the UK charts, and its US version (entitled simply ''Pink Floyd'' and featuring a re-arranged and abbreviated tracklisting) reached #131 on the US charts. "See Emily Play" substituted "Astronomy Domine", "Flaming" and "Bike" on the original US vinyl issue. In 1973, the album, along with ''A Saucerful of Secrets'', was released as a double disk set entitled, ''[[A Nice Pair]]''. (Note - in that compilation, the original studio version of "[[Astronomy Domine]]" was replaced with the live version found on ''"[[Ummagumma]]"''). The stereo mix of the album was first released on [[compact disc|CD]] in 1987, and re-released as a digitally re-mastered CD in 1994 and then in June of 1995 in the US. Three years later, EMI released a re-mastered, limited-run mono mix version in a hefty [[digipak]] with [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]] box art for continental Europe and the world outside America. This was however not the same mix as the now ultra-rare mono LP.

== Reception ==
At the time of release, the album was received positively, and in subsequent years the record is recognised as one of the seminal psychedelic rock albums of the 1960s. In 1967, both [[Record Mirror]] and [[NME]] gave the album four stars out of five. Record Mirror commented that - "the psychedelic image of the group really comes to life on this LP, which is a fine showcase for both their talent and the recording technique. Plenty of mindblowing sound". [[Paul McCartney]] and Pink Floyds past producer [[Joe Boyd]], both rated the album highly. Some, most notably [[Pete Townshend]], voiced the opinion of the underground fans, by suggesting that the album did not reflect the bands live performances. In recent years the album has gained even more recognition.  In 1999 ''Rolling Stone Magazine'' gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it - "the golden achievement of Syd Barrett". [[Q Magazine]] described the album as "indispensable", and included it in their best psycheldelic albums of all time. It was also ranked 40th in ''[[Mojo]]'' magazines, The 50 Most Out There Albums of all Time. In 2000 [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] placed ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' at number 55 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. {{RS500|347}}[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6599401/347_the_piper_at_the_gates_of_dawn]

== Quotes ==
"We were given Norman Smith by EMI, no arguments. So Joe
Boyd, our original producer, got written out of the thing. Norman was
more interested in making us sound like a classical rock band. It was a
bit like the George Martin thing, a useful influence to have. But I
think Joe would have given Syd his head, let him run in a freer way. We
spent three months recording it, which was quite a long time in
those days. Bands used to have to finish albums in a week, with session
players brought in to play the difficult bits. But because The
Beatles were taking their time recording Sgt Pepper in the studio next
door, EMI thought this was the way people now made records" - Nick Mason
