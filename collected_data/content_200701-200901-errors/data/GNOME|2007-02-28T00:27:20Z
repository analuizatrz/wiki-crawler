The '''GNOME''' project is an international effort to create an easy-to-use [[computing platform]] built entirely from [[free software]]. This goal includes creating tools which help developers write new stand-alone [[application software]], selecting applications for inclusion in the official product, and working on what is known as the [[desktop environment]] — the programs which manage application launching, file handling, and window and task management.

A great deal of [[software]] is created or hosted under the umbrella of the GNOME project, some of which is collected and released as GNOME. GNOME is used in conjunction with an [[operating system]] such as [[Linux]] or [[Sun Microsystems]]’ [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]], to create a fully functional computer system.

GNOME is part of the [[GNU]] operating system, and is its official desktop environment. The official [[IPA chart for English|pronunciation]] of the name is {{IPA|/gəˈnoʊm/}} with a hard “G”, although {{IPA|/noʊm/}} (as in the English word “[[gnome]]”) is also in common usage.

== Aims ==

According to the GNOME website:<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.gnome.org/about/ | title = About GNOME | accessdate = 2005-09-08 }}</ref>
{{Cquote|The GNOME project provides two things: The GNOME desktop environment, an intuitive and attractive desktop for users, and the GNOME development platform, an extensive framework for building applications that integrate into the rest of the desktop.}}

The GNOME project puts heavy emphasis on simplicity, usability, and making things “just work”. The other aims of the project are:

* Freedom&mdash;to create a desktop environment that will always be free of charge, with the source code available for re-use under a Free software license.
* [[Computer accessibility|Accessibility]]&mdash;ensuring the desktop can be used by anyone, regardless of technical skill or physical disability.
* [[Internationalization and localization]]&mdash;making the desktop available in many languages.
* Developer-friendliness&mdash;ensuring it is easy to write software that integrates smoothly with the desktop, and allow developers a free choice of programming language.
* Organisation&mdash;a regular release cycle and a disciplined community structure.
* Support&mdash;ensuring backing from other institutions beyond the GNOME community.

=== Multilingual ===

Gnome is being translated to the following [http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/ languages]

== Origin ==
[[Image:GNOME-Screenshot-2.13-Jp.png|thumb|right|300px|GNOME 2.13.3 (development version) using the Japanese language, with [[Tango Desktop Project]] pre-release icons.]]

The GNOME project was started in August 1997 by [[Miguel de Icaza]] and [[Federico Mena]] in response to licensing concerns over software used by [[KDE]], a free software desktop environment that relies on the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] [[widget toolkit]]. At the time, Qt did not use a [[free software license]] and members of the GNU project became concerned about the use of such a toolkit for building a free software desktop and applications. Two projects were started: the [[Harmony toolkit]], to create a free replacement for the Qt libraries, and GNOME to create a new desktop without Qt and built entirely on top of free software.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-09-05-001-21-OP-LF-KE | author = Richard Stallman | title = Stallman on Qt, the GPL, KDE, and GNOME | accessdate = 2005-09-09 | date = 2000-09-05 }}</ref>

In place of the Qt toolkit, [[GTK+]] was chosen as the base of the GNOME desktop. GTK+ uses the [[GNU Lesser Public License]] (LGPL), a free software license that allows software linking to it, such as applications written for GNOME, to use a much wider set of licenses, including [[proprietary software]] licenses.<ref>http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/lgpl.html</ref> The GNOME desktop itself is licensed under the LGPL for its libraries, and the GPL for applications that are part of the GNOME project itself. While Qt is dual-licensed under both the [[QPL]] and the [[GPL]], the freedom to link proprietary software with GTK+ at no charge makes it differ from Qt.

The name “GNOME” was proposed as an acronym of '''GNU Network Object Model Environment''' by Elliot Lee, one of the authors of [[ORBit]] and the [[Object Activation Framework]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} It refers to GNOME’s original intention of creating a [[distributed object]] framework similar to [[Microsoft]]’s [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]].<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://developer.gnome.org/doc/GGAD/ggad.html | title = GTK+ / Gnome Application Development | accessdate = 2006-09-08 | last = Pennington | first = Havoc | authorlink = Havoc Pennington | year = 1999 }}</ref> This no longer reflects the core vision of the GNOME project, and the full expansion of the name is now considered obsolete. As such, some members of the project advocate dropping the acronym and re-naming “GNOME” to “Gnome”.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2006-April/msg00436.html | title = Desktop Development mailing list | accessdate = 2006-05-07 }}</ref>

== Project structure ==
As with most free software projects, the GNOME project is loosely managed. Discussion chiefly occurs on a number of public mailing lists.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://mail.gnome.org | title = GNOME mailing lists, rules and FAQs }}</ref>

In August 2000 the [[GNOME Foundation]] was set up to deal with administrative tasks, press interest and to act as a contact point for companies interested in developing GNOME software. While not directly involved in technical decisions, the Foundation does coordinate releases and decide which projects will be part of GNOME. Membership is open to anyone who has made a non-trivial contribution to the project.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://foundation.gnome.org/membership/ | title = Membership of the GNOME foundation | accessdate = 2005-09-08 }}</ref> Members of the Foundation elect a board of directors every November, and candidates for the positions must be members themselves. 

Developers and users of GNOME gather at an annual meeting known as [[GUADEC]] in order to discuss the current state of the project and its future direction.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://guadec.org/about | title = About GUADEC }}</ref>

== Platforms ==
[[Image:GNOME-Screenshot-2.10-FC4.png|thumb||right|300px|GNOME 2.10 screenshot (on [[Fedora Core]] 4) showing [[Rhythmbox]] (music player), [[GThumb]] (image manager), [[gedit]] (text editor), and the [[Nautilus file manager]].]]

Originally designed for [[GNU]] (or [[GNU/Linux]]), GNOME now runs on most [[Unix-like]] systems and in particular has been adopted by Sun Microsystems as part of [[Java Desktop System]], replacing the [[Common Desktop Environment]] on their Solaris platform. It is the default desktop environment for many modern desktop [[Linux distribution]]s, including [[Fedora Core]] and [[Ubuntu (Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]]. A list of Linux distributions that include GNOME is maintained on the GNOME website.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.gnome.org/~davyd/footware.shtml | title = Distributions that ship GNOME as their Default Desktop }}</ref>

An official GNOME [[LiveCD]], which allows a computer to [[booting|boot]] directly from a [[Compact Disc]] without removing or changing existing operating systems, is available for download from the GNOME website.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://torrent.gnome.org/ | title = The official GNOME LiveCD }}</ref>

Many GNOME components have been ported to [[Cygwin]], allowing GNOME applications to run on [[Microsoft Windows]].

== Architecture ==

GNOME is built from a large number of different projects. A few of the major ones are listed below:

* [[Bonobo (computing)|Bonobo]] – a [[compound document]] technology.
* [[GConf]] – for storing application settings.
* [[GNOME VFS]] – a virtual [[file system]].
* [[GNOME Keyring]] – for storing [[encryption]] keys and security information.
* [[GNOME Translation Project]] – translate documentation and applications into different languages.
* [[GTK+]] – a [[widget toolkit]] used for constructing graphical applications. The use of GTK+ as the base widget toolkit allows GNOME to benefit from certain features such as theming (the ability to change the look of an application), smooth anti-aliased graphics. Sub-projects of GTK+ provide object oriented programming support (GObjects), extensive support of international character sets and text layout ([[Pango]]) and accessibility ([[Accessibility Toolkit|ATK]]). GTK+ reduces the amount of work required to port GNOME applications to other platforms such as Windows and Mac OS X.
* [[Human Interface Guidelines]] (HIG) – research and documentation on building easy-to-use GNOME applications.
* [[LibXML]] – an XML library.
* [[ORBit]] – a CORBA [[Object request broker|ORB]] for [[software componentry]].

A number of [[language binding]]s are available allowing applications to be written in a variety of programming languages, such as [[C++]] ([[gtkmm]]), [[Java (programming language)|Java]] ([[Java-GNOME]]), [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]] ([[ruby-gnome2]]), [[C Sharp|C#]] ([[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]]), [[Python (programming language)|Python]] ([[PyGTK]]), [[Perl]] ([[gtk2-perl]]) and many others. The only languages currently used in applications that are part of an official GNOME desktop release are C, C# and Python.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2006-April/msg00332.html | title = GNOME desktop-devel mailing list }}</ref>

== Look and feel ==

GNOME is designed around the traditional computing [[desktop metaphor]]. Its handling of windows, applications and files is similar to that of contemporary desktop operating systems. In its default configuration, the desktop has a launcher menu for quick access to installed programs and file locations; open windows may be accessed by a taskbar along the bottom of the screen and the top-right corner features a notification area for programs to display notices while running in the background. However these features can be moved to almost anywhere the user desires, replaced with other functions or removed altogether.

The appearance of GNOME can be changed by the use of themes, which are sets consisting of an [[icon]] set, window manager border and GTK+ theme engine and parameters. Popular GTK+ themes include [[Bluecurve]] and [[Clearlooks]] (the current default theme).

GNOME puts emphasis on being easy for everyone to use. The HIG helps guide developers in producing applications which look and behave similarly, in order to provide a cohesive GNOME interface.

== Usability ==

Since GNOME v2.0, a key focus of the project has been usability. As a part of this, a large effort was put into creating the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).  The HIG is an extensive guide for creating high quality, consistent, usable GUI programs, covering everything from GUI design to recommended pixel-based layout of widgets.

GNOME HIG introduction:<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/ | title = GNOME Human Interface Guidelines | accessdate = 2006-10-05 }}</ref>
{{Cquote|This document tells you how to create applications that look right, behave properly, and fit into the GNOME user interface as a whole. It is written for interface designers, graphic artists and software developers who will be creating software for the GNOME environment. Both specific advice on making effective use of interface elements, and the philosophy and general design principles behind the GNOME interface are covered.}}

During the v2.0 rewrite, many settings were deemed to be “crack” settings (of little or no value to the majority of users) and were removed.  For instance, the preferences section of the Panel were reduced from a sprawling dialog of six large tabs to a much simpler one with two small tabs.

== Freedesktop.org and GNOME ==

[[Freedesktop.org]] is a project to assist interoperability and shared technology between the different [[X Window desktop]]s such as GNOME, [[KDE]] or [[Xfce]]. Although it is not a formal standards organization, Freedesktop.org defines certain basic features of an X Desktop, including drag and drop between applications, window manager specifications, menu layouts, recent files lists, copy and pasting between applications and a shared [[MIME]] type database, among other things. Following Freedesktop.org specifications allows GNOME applications to appear more integrated into other desktops (and vice versa), and encourages cooperation as well as competition.

Examples of technologies originated at Freedesktop.org which now form part of GNOME’s core technology set include:

* [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] – a sophisticated 2D graphics library.
* [[D-Bus]] – interprocess communication system.
* [[GStreamer]] – a multimedia framework.
* [[Hardware abstraction layer|HAL]] – a specification and an implementation of a hardware abstraction layer.
* [[Poppler (software)|Poppler]] – a PDF rendering library.
* [[Tango Desktop Project]] – which aims to provide a common visual standard across different platforms.

These initiatives aim to allow users and developers to choose the technologies and applications they like regardless of which desktop environment they use.

== Applications ==

Along with those applications bundled with the desktop, a large amount of other applications have been developed for use in GNOME. See [[List of GNOME applications]] for a more complete list.

=== Official applications ===

The following selection of applications typically supplied as part of a GNOME release:

* [[Ekiga]] – a phone and video conferencing application using [[voice over IP]].
* [[Epiphany (web browser)|Epiphany]] – a [[web browser]].
* [[Evince]] – a document viewer for PDF and PostScript documents.
* [[Novell Evolution|Evolution]] – an email and groupware application.
* [[Eye of GNOME]] – a simple image viewer.
* [[File Roller]] – an archive manager.
* [[gedit]] – a [[text editor]].
* [[gnome-dictionary]] – a [[DICT]] protocol client. 
* [[gnome-panel]] – a desktop panel for launching applications and showing applets.
* [[GNOME Terminal]] – a terminal emulator.
* [[Metacity]] – a [[X window manager|window manager]].
* [[Nautilus (file manager)|Nautilus]] – a [[file manager]].
* [[Sound Juicer]] – a CD ripping tool.
* [[Tomboy (software)|Tomboy]] – a notetaking tool.
* [[Totem (media player)|Totem]] – a media player.

=== Other applications ===

The following is a selection of applications that use technology from the GNOME project and are likely to be used on an average GNOME desktop:

* [[AbiWord]] – a [[word processor]].
* [[Banshee (music player)|Banshee]] – a music player.
* [[F-Spot]] – a [[digital photo]] organizer.
* [[Gaim]] – an [[instant messaging]] client.
* The [[GIMP]] – an advanced [[bitmap graphics editor]].
* [[GnomeBaker]] – a CD/DVD authoring application.
* [[Gnumeric]] – a [[spreadsheet]]ing program.
* [[GnuCash]] – [[double-entry book-keeping]] software.
* [[Inkscape]] – a [[vector graphics]] drawing application.
* [[Planner (project management)|Planner]] – Planner[http://live.gnome.org/Planner] is the GNOME project management tool similar to [[MSProject]]
* [[Rhythmbox]] – a music-management application similar to [[iTunes]].

== Stable releases ==

Each of the parts making up the GNOME project has its own version number and release schedule. However, individual module maintainers coordinate their efforts to create a full GNOME stable release on a roughly six-month schedule. The releases listed in the table below are classed as [[Development stage#Stable/Unstable|stable]]. Unstable releases for testers and developers are not listed, nor are bugfix releases for individual modules.

== Source code ==

GNOME releases are made in the form of [[source code]], which is compiled by operating system vendors and integrated with the rest of their systems before distribution. Most vendors use only stable and tested versions of GNOME, and provide it in the form of easily installed pre-compiled packages. The source code of every stable version of GNOME is stored in a [[version control system]] in the GNOME source code repository.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://cvs.gnome.org/ | title = Information about the GNOME source code repository }}</ref> 

The process of downloading the source code, compiling and installing the entire GNOME desktop manually is a laborious and time-consuming process, and a number of build-[[Scripting programming language|script]]s (such as [[JHBuild]] or [[GARNOME]]) can be used to automate it.

Those interested in testing, fixing bugs or adding new features can use the latest unstable branch from the GNOME source code tree, known as “HEAD”. Development code contains new modifications and experimental changes to the code which are later “frozen” to allow for the code to be tested and bugs to be corrected.

== Future developments ==

There are many sub-projects under the umbrella of the GNOME project, and not all of them are currently included in GNOME releases. Some are considered purely experimental concepts, or for testing ideas that will one day migrate into stable GNOME applications; others are code that is being polished for direct inclusion. Some examples include:

* [[GNOME Storage]] – database filing system for GNOME. Compare with the postponed [[WinFS]] storage system.
* Project Topaz – ideas for GNOME version 3.0.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero | title = Project Topaz homepage }}</ref>
* Project Soylent – making “people” and their interactions first-class objects within the GNOME framework.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://trac.galago-project.org/wiki/ProjectSoylent | title = Project Soylent homepage }}</ref>
* [http://live.gnome.org/ProjectRidley Project Ridley] – to consolidate several small undermaintained libraries into GTK+, such as libgnome and libgnomeprint.
* The use of the Mozilla project’s [[XUL]] on the GNOME desktop.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5201325.html | title = Mozilla, Gnome mull united front against Longhorn | publisher = News.com | accessdate = 2006-04-20 }}</ref>

There had been considerable discussion about including software written in C# or Java in GNOME.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://ometer.com/desktop-language.html | title = Java, Mono, or C++? | accessdate = 2006-09-05 | last = Pennington | first = Havoc | date = 2004-03-16 }}</ref> With GNOME 2.16, [[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]] (the C# bindings for GTK+ and GNOME) and [[Mono (software)|Mono]] have been added to the list of dependencies, and a C# application, [[Tomboy (software)|Tomboy]], has also been included in that release.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.gnome.org/start/2.16/notes/C/index.html | title = GNOME 2.16 Release Notes | accessdate = 2006-09-07 | author = Vincent Untz, Quim Gil, SegPhault, John Williams, Brent Smith | date = 2006-09-06 }}</ref>
