The '''Colorado Avalanche''' are a professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Denver, Colorado]], [[United States]]. They are members of the [[Northwest Division (NHL)|Northwest Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The Avalanche have won the [[Stanley Cup]] two times, in 1996 and 2001. The franchise was founded in [[Quebec City|Quebec]] and were the [[Quebec Nordiques]] until moving to [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1995. The Avalanche have won 8 division titles and had gone to playoffs in each of their first 10 seasons in the NHL, with the streak ending in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |title =Colorado Avalanche History|url =http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/teams/history/COL|publisher =CBS Sportsline|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> The Avalanche is also notable for being the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup their first season after a re-location.

From the time of their move to Denver in 1995 until the end of the 1998-99 season, the Avalanche played their home games at [[McNichols Sports Arena|McNichols Arena]]. Since then, the Avalanche have called the [[Pepsi Center]] home. The Avalanche has a notable rivalry with the [[Detroit Red Wings]] due to both teams having met each other five times in seven years in the Western Conference playoffs between 1996 and 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title =Welcome to NHL's nastiest rivalry|url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RM&p_theme=rm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB4E6E5FAB223F2&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author =Kravitz, Bob|publisher =Rocky Mountain News|date =1996-12-18|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

==Franchise history==
===Quebec Nordiques (1972-1995)===
{{see also|Quebec Nordiques}}
The Quebec Nordiques were one of the [[World Hockey Association]]'s original teams when the league began play in [[1972-73 WHA season|1972]]. Though first awarded to a group in [[San Francisco]], the team quickly moved to [[Quebec City]] when the [[California]] deal soured due to financial and arena problems.<ref name="whanordiques">{{cite web |title =Quebec Nordiques|url =http://www.whahockey.com/nordiques.html|publisher =WHA Hockey|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> During their seven WHA seasons, the Nordiques won the [[Avco World Trophy]] once, in [[1976-77 WHA season|1977]] and lost the finals once, in [[1974-75 WHA season|1975]].<ref>{{cite web |title =WHA Yearly Standings|url =http://www.whahockey.com/whayearlystandings.html|publisher =WHA Hockey|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Two years later, in [[1979-80 NHL season|1979]], they entered the NHL, along with the WHA's [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Hartford Whalers]], and [[Winnipeg Jets]].<ref>{{cite web |title =From the WHA to the NHL |url =http://www.nhl.com/history/062279.html|publisher =NHL|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

After making the postseason for seven consecutive years, [[1980-81 NHL season|1981]] to [[1986-87 NHL season|1987]], the Nordiques fell into the league's basement.<ref name="nordiquesrecord">{{cite web |title =Quebec Nordiques Almanac|url =http://www.nordiquespreservation.com/record.html|publisher =Nordiques Preservation|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> In [[1991 NHL Entry Draft|1991]], for the third straight draft, Quebec had the first overall selection.<ref>{{cite web |title =NHL Entry Draft First Round Selections 1980-89|url =http://www.nhl.com/futures/firstround80_89.html#89|publisher =NHL|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title =NHL Entry Draft First Round Selections 1990-99|url =http://www.nhl.com/futures/firstround90_99.html|publisher =NHL|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Although [[Eric Lindros]], the draft's top-ranked player, had made it clear he did not wish to play for the Nordiques, they drafted him anyway.<ref>{{cite news |title =A look back: 1991|url =http://www.nhl.com/futures/2006draft/lookback_91_053106.html|author =Roarke,Shawn P.|publisher =NHL|date =2006-05-31|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Lindros did not even wear the jersey for the press photographs, only holding it when it was presented to him.<ref name="lindrosnhl">{{cite news |title =As expected, Quebec selects Lindros No.1|url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=DSNB&d_place=DSNB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F360039496DAD62&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author =|publisher =Associated Press|date =1991-06-23|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> On advice from his mother, Lindros refused to sign a contract and began a holdout that would last over a year.

In the first season after the trade, the [[1992-93 NHL season]], the Nordiques reached the playoffs for the first time in six years and would do so two seasons later. 

While the team experienced on-ice success, the team was far less successful off the ice.  Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the league, and many players (including Lindros) were skittish about playing in a virtually unilingual francophone city.  Finally, in 1995, team owner [[Marcel Aubut]] asked for a bailout from Quebec's provincial government.<ref>{{cite news |title =Quebec's Government Plans Bailout to keep Nordiques from moving|url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB5DDC4964DA9E0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author =|publisher =Associated Press|date =1994-04-09|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> The bailout fell through and Aubut subsequently sold the team to a group of investors in [[Denver]].<ref>{{cite news |title =NHL's Nordiques sold, moving west to Denver \ Comsat Entretainment Group bought the team.

===Colorado Avalanche (1995-Present)===
[[Image:Patrick_Roy_1999.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Goaltender [[Patrick Roy]], the winningest net minder in the NHL, played for the Avalanche from 1995-2003.]]

==== The beginning ====

Led by [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]] [[Joe Sakic]], forward [[Peter Forsberg]], and defenseman [[Adam Foote]], Colorado entered their first season in Denver with a strong lineup and an intrigued fan base. 

Former [[Montreal Canadiens]] goalie [[Patrick Roy]], joined the Avalanche after the infamous December 2, 1995 game between the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and the [[Detroit Red Wings]].  During the December 2nd match-up, Roy was left in the net after having let in 9 goals in 26 shots.  By the time Roy was finally benched, he felt humiliated and told team president [[Ronald Corey]] it was his last game for the Canadiens.  Four days later, Roy joined the Avalanche with ex-Montreal captain [[Mike Keane]] in exchange for [[Jocelyn Thibault]], [[Martin Rucinsky]] and [[Andrei Kovalenko]].<ref>{{cite news |title =Roy gets call he's in Hall|url =http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/nhl/article/0,2777,DRMN_23920_4810040,00.html|author =Sadowski, Rick|publisher =Rocky Mountain News|date =2006-06-29|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>.  Roy would prove a pivotal addition for Colorado in the years to come.

In the [[1995-96 NHL season|1996 playoffs]], after beating the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in a six-game series in the Western Conference Final, the Avalanche would roll into the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals to meet the [[Florida Panthers]]. In Game Four, during the third [[overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] and after more than 100 minutes of play with no goals, defenseman [[Uwe Krupp]] scored to claim the franchise's first Cup.<ref>{{cite news |title =No stopping the Avalanche - Colorado completes Cup sweep of Panthers with 3OT victory|url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&p_theme=saec&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB03D7A86BE23F7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author =Ulman, Howard|publisher =Associated Press|date =1996-06-11|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

==== The Quest for a second Cup ====

In [[1996-97 NHL season|1996-97]], Colorado lost in the Western Conference Finals in a rematch against the Red Wings, despite having won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] for best regular-season record. After losing in the Conference Quarterfinals in [[1997-98 NHL season|1997-98]] against the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the Avalanche lost two more Western Conference Finals the following two years, both times against the [[Dallas Stars]].

After failing to do so in 2000, for the [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01 season]] the Avalanche strengthened their defense for a run at the Stanley Cup. On February 21, 2001, they acquired star defenseman [[Rob Blake]] and defensive center [[Steven Reinprecht]] from the [[Los Angeles Kings]] for [[Adam Deadmarsh]], [[Aaron Miller]] and their first-round [[2001 NHL Entry Draft|2001 Draft]] pick.<ref>{{cite news |title =Kings take Avs' Aulin to complete Blake trade|url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72313179.html|author =Sadowski, Rick|publisher =Rocky Mountain News|date =2001-03-23|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> On March 6, [[1999-2000 NHL season|2000]], the [[Boston Bruins]] traded future [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r defenseman [[Ray Bourque]] and [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]] [[Dave Andreychuk]] to Colorado for [[Brian Rolston]], [[Martin Grenier]], [[Samuel Pahlsson]], and a first-round draft pick. Bourque, who had been a Bruin since [[1979-80 NHL season|1979-80]], requested a trade to a contender for one last shot at a Stanley Cup.<ref name="bourque">{{cite news |title =For Bourque, at long last Stanley!|url =http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=290833|author =Roarke, Shawn P.|publisher =[[National Hockey League|NHL]]|date =2007-03-22|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

Colorado won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] again, with a 52-16-10-4, 118-point record. The team had dedicated 00-01 to getting Ray Bourque a ring.<ref>{{cite news |title =Bourque Is Frozen Out No More|url =http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73933206.html?dids=73933206:73933206&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=JUN+11%2C+2001&author=Jason+La+Canfora&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=Bourque+Is+Frozen+Out+No+More%3B+In+22nd+Try%2C+Defenseman+Ends+Up+a+Stanley+Cup+Winner&pqatl=google|author =Canfora, Jason La|publisher =Washington Post|date =2001-06-11|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Although [[Peter Forsberg]] had emergency spleen surgery after their second-round series against the Kings and missed the rest of the playoffs, the Avalanche won against the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Devils had taken a 3-2 advantage in the series onto home ice for Game Six, but Colorado won 4-0 in New Jersey and then 3-1 in Denver to claim the Cup. After being handed the Cup from [[NHL Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]], the captain Joe Sakic immediately gave it to Ray Bourque, capping off Bourque's 22-year career with his only championship.<ref>{{cite news |title =Avalanche beat Devils to capture Stanley Cup|url =http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup01/games/2001-06-09-njcol.htm|author =Allen, Kevin|publisher =USA Today|date =2001-06-10|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

==== 2001 and beyond ====

The Avalanche have failed to reach the Stanley Cup Finals since 2001. In [[2001-02 NHL season|2002]], they lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals in a 7-game series. In [[2002-03 NHL Season|2003]], the Avalanche blew a 3-1 lead over the [[Minnesota Wild]] in overtime of Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs.<ref>{{cite news |title = Minnesota 3, Colorado 2|url =http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/recaps/2003/04/21/min_col/|author =|publisher =Sports Illustrated|dateG=2003-04-22|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

After that season, Patrick Roy retired and the Avalanche signed star wingers [[Paul Kariya]] and [[Teemu Selänne]] from the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]].<ref>{{cite news |title =Avalanche sign Kariya, Selanne to one-year deals|url =http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2003/07/03/avs_signings_ap/|author =|publisher =Associated Press|date =2003-07-03|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Both failed to live up to the expectations and for the first time in Denver and first since the [[1993-94 NHL season|1993-94 season]], the franchise failed to win their division, ending an NHL-record nine consecutive division titles.<ref>{{cite news |title =NHL's winningest goalie retiring after 18 seasons|url =http://espn.go.com/nhl/news/2003/0527/1559398.html|author =|publisher =Associated Press|date =2003-05-28|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

After the [[2004-05 NHL lockout]] and the implementation of a salary cap, the Avalanche had to let go some of their top players. Peter Forsberg and [[Adam Foote]] were lost to free agency in order to save some room in the cap for Joe Sakic and Rob Blake.<ref>{{cite news |title =Sakic, Blake to stay; Forsberg, Foote up in air|url =http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2116068|author =|publisher =Associated Press|date =2005-07-26|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Although the salary cap was a blow to one of the biggest spenders of the league,<ref>{{cite news |title =Winners, losers, undecided in wake of free-agent frenzy|url =http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/story/8790788|author =Goldstein, Wes|publisher =CBS Sportsline|date =2005-08-31|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> the Avalanche made it to the Conference semifinals, where they lost to the [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in a 4-0 series. The day after the loss, [[Pierre Lacroix]], who had been the General Manager of the franchise since 1994, resigned and [[François Giguère]] was hired.<ref>{{cite news |title =Lacroix steps down as Colorado GM|url =http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/avalanche/2006-05-12-lacroix-resigns_x.htm|author =|publisher =Associated Press|date =2006-05-12|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title =Avs hire Giguere as team's general manager|url =http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2456902|author =|publisher =Associated Press|date =2006-05-24|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Lacroix remains to this day as President of the franchise.<ref>{{cite web |title =Pierre Lacroix Profile|url =http://www.coloradoavalanche.com/Team/StaffBio.aspx?SID=7|publisher =Colorado Avalanche|accessdate =2007-02-25}}</ref>

By the beginning of the [[2006-07 NHL season|2006-07 season]] Joe Sakic and [[Milan Hejduk]] were the only two remaining members since the 2001 Stanley Cup winning team. Joe Sakic is the only player left from the team's days in Quebec (though Hejduk was drafted by the Nordiques), but [[Paul Stastny]], son of Nordiques legend [[Peter Stastny]], also provides a link to the past.

Despite missing the 2006-2007 playoffs, the Avalanche had a 15-2-2 run at the end of the season in attempt to keep their playoff hopes alive.  The Avs were still in the hunt, chasing the [[Calgary Flames]] to within three points with two games left, until the second to last game of the regular season on [[April 7]], [[2007]] against the [[Nashville Predators]].  During the game, Peter Forsberg, now in a Predators' uniform, was honored with a video highlight of his career with the Avalanche, and he received a standing ovation from the fans at the Pepsi Center.  Ironically, it would be Forsberg and his two assists who would shut down Colorado's 10-season playoff streak.

The final game of the 2006-2007 regular season was against the Calgary Flames, who, because of the Avs' loss, clinched the eighth seed in the playoffs with 96 points, beating the Avs by a single poinr.  The Avs recorded a decisive 6-3 win in which Joe Sakic earned his 100th point of the season.  At 37, Sakic became the second-oldest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, joining [[Gordie Howe]], who had 103 points at age 40 in the 1968-69 season.   For the second night in a row, the fans at the Pepsi Center would dole out a standing ovation, this time to Joe Sakic and the entire Avalanche team for their efforts during the 15-2-2 run.  The Avs returned the ovation by raising their sticks in acknowledgment, thus thanking the fans and marking the end of an emotional roller coaster of a season.

Until the Avs' 2006-2007 season, no team in the history of the NHL had ever made it to 95 points without earning a spot in the playoffs. In the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]], three teams made it to the [[2007 NHL playoffs|playoffs]] with less than 95 points: the [[New York Rangers]] (94), the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] (93), and the [[New York Islanders]] (92).

===Rivalry with the Detroit Red Wings===
In [[1995-96 NHL season|1996]], the Colorado Avalanche met the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the Western Conference Finals and won the series 4-2.  During Game 6 on May 29, 1996 of the 1996 Conference Finals, as Red Wings player [[Kris Draper]] was skating backwards towards near the bench, he was checked into the boards by Avalanche player [[Claude Lemieux]].<ref name="bloodfeud">{{cite book  | last =Dater| first = Adrian| title =Blood Feud: Detroit Red Wings vs. Colorado Avalanche| publisher =Taylor Trade Publishing| date =2006| url =http://www.denverpost.com/books/ci_5106839| isbn =1589793196}}</ref> Draper lost a lot of blood but did not lose consciousness until being taken off the ice.  His nose, jaw, and cheekbone had been broken.  There was also concern Draper's right eye socket had been shattered.  Additionally, five teeth were bent inward toward his throat and a total of 40 stitches were needed to close wounds around his eye and inside his mouth.<ref name="bloodfeud"/> Draper underwent facial reconstructive surgery and had to have his jaw wired shut for five weeks while Lemieux was only suspended for two games of the Stanley Cup Finals.<ref name="avsrw10y">{{cite news |title =Happy anniversary to Red Wings, Avalanche|url =http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=neumann/070326|author =Neumann, Thomas|publisher =ESPN|date =2007-03-26|accessdate =2007-03-27}}</ref> After the incident, Lemieux received many threats from Red Wings players and fans,  with goalie [[Chris Osgood]] being the first to issue one saying, "Our players aren't going to forget it.  When [Lemieux] comes back to play the Wings next year, he'd better be ready.  We'll be waiting for him."<ref name="bloodfeud"/>

In the following season, in the last regular season meeting between the Avalanche and Red Wings on March 26, 1997, a brawl known as [[Brawl in Hockeytown]] occurred. The game ended with 9 fights, 11 goals, 39 penalties, 148 penalty minutes, one hat-trick (by [[Valeri Kamensky]]) and a goalie fight between Stanley Cup champion goalies [[Patrick Roy]] and [[Mike Vernon]].<ref name="avsrw10y"/> After two fights in the first period, the brawl errupted.  At 18:22 of the first period, Peter Forsberg and Igor Larionov started fighting when the two became entangled near the Detroit bench.<ref name="avsrw10y"/>  Moments later, McCarty found his way to Lemieux and threw a right hand punch that landed on Lemieux's head.  Lemieux attempted to get to his feet after the initial punch but was pushed down by McCarty and punched over and over in the head and back.   Noticing Claude Lemieux was all alone, Patrick Roy stormed out of his net.  Seeing this, Brendan Shanahan attempted to intercept Roy and the two collided mid-ice, causing Mike Vernon to leave his net as well.  Famously, Roy and Vernon squared off at center ice, a fight in which Roy would land more punches and Vernon would win the wrestling match.  

Meanwhile, McCarty dragged Lemieux near the Red Wings bench, where Kris Draper was seated, and was continuing to pummel him, ending the beating with a knee to Lemieux's head.  Lemieux required 10 to 15 stitches to close the wounds on his head and McCarty was only dealt a double minor penalty for roughing.  

It took about 10 minutes for the referees to gain control but four more fights occurred throughout the rest of the game. 

The Red Wings ended up winning the game in overtime 6-5.<ref name="avsrw10y"/> Both teams met again in the Conference Finals that season and Red Wings went on to win the Stanley Cup. In the following five years, the Avalanche and the Red Wings met three times in the playoffs, with Colorado winning the first two and losing the last.

This rivalry is considered one of the top rivalries in the NHL by the press and fans. <ref>{{cite news |title =Part II -- Top rivalries|url =http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/preview2005/news/story?id=2172427|author =|publisher =ESPN|date =2005-10-29|accessdate =2007-03-27}}</ref>

===The sell-out streak===

After a record 487 consecutive games, the NHL's longest consecutive attendance sellout ended with the Avalanche on [[October 16]], [[2006]] after a reported attendance of 17,681 which was 326 under capacity at the [[Pepsi Center]] before an Avalanche-[[Chicago Blackhawks]] game, which the [[Hawk]]s ultimately won 5-3 (Empty Net). The streak began on [[November 9]], [[1995]], the Avalanche's eighth [[regular season]] home game during the [[1995-96 NHL season]], before a sellout of 16,061 at the [[McNichols Sports Arena]] versus the [[Dallas Stars]].<ref>{{cite news |title =Avs see sellout streak get away|url =http://www.denverpost.com/avalanche/ci_4503924|author =Frei, Terry|publisher =Denver Post|date =2006-10-17|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> The Avalanche recorded their 500th home sellout in their 515th game in Denver on [[January 20]] [[2007]], against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Avalanche Reaches 500th Sellout In Denver |url =http://www.coloradoavalanche.com/News/NewsDetails.aspx?NID=780|author =|publisher =Colorado Avalanche|date =2006-01-20|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

The Avalanche jerseys have not changed since their first season in 1995. The team colors are burgundy, blue and white. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until 2003 when the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] decided to switch home and road jerseys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statenews.com/article.phtml?pk=15112|title=NHL 'quacked' up with hockey jersey switch|first=Kristofer|last=Karol|publisher=[[State News]]|date=[[January 27]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> is dominantly burgundy and dark blue in color. There are two black and white [[zigzag]] lines along the jersey, one in the shoulders, the other near the belly. Between them, the jersey is burgundy, outside those lines it is dark blue. Similar lines exist around the neck. The Avalanche logo is in the center of the jersey. On top of the shoulders, there is the alternate logo, one on each side. The away jersey is similar, just with different colors. The burgundy part on the home jersey is white on the away jersey, the dark blue part is burgundy and the black and white lines became white and dark blue.

The Avalanche have introduced a third jersey during the 2001-02 season.<ref>{{cite news |title =OILERS 4, AVALANCHE 1 "Third jersey' to make debut on Halloween|url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&p_theme=dp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EF431E783FCBE23&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author =Dater, Adrian|publisher =Denver Post|date =2001-10-19|accessdate =2007-03-26}}</ref> It is dominantly burgundy. "Colorado" is spelled in a diagonal across the jersey where the logo is on the other jerseys. From the belly down, three large horizontal stripes, the first and the last being black and the middle one being white. In the middle of the arms, there are 5 stripes, black, white and burgundy from the outside inside in both sides.

The Avalanche have retired two numbers: '''77''' of [[Ray Bourque]] and '''33''' of [[Patrick Roy]].<ref>{{cite news |title =Patrick Roy #33 to Be Retired|url =http://www.sportzdomain.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=14361&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0|author =|publisher =http://www.sportzdomain.com|date =2003-05-29|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> The numbers retired when the franchise was in Quebec were entered back into circulation after the move to Colorado.

Ray Bourque played in the NHL for 22 seasons with the [[Boston Bruins]] and was traded, by request, to Colorado in 2000 so he could have a chance of winning the Stanley Cup before retiring.<ref name="bourque"/>  In a feat termed Mission 16W, the Avs were able to win the Stanley Cup, thus allowing Bourque the championship he had been seeking for 22 seasons.  

[[Patrick Roy]] played from 1995 to 2003 in Colorado and won two Stanley Cups with the Colorado Avalanche.  Roy recorded 551 career victories, the most career wins for any goaltender in the NHL.

Both Bourque and Roy were inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. The only other Avalanche player to be inducted is [[Jari Kurri]] who played the last season of his career with the franchise, yet his jersey does not hang from the rafters at the Pepsi Center, thus only Bourque's #77 and Roy's #33 are the only officially retired numbers.

[[Joe Sakic]] is the only captain the Avalanche have ever had. He was on both Avalanche Stanley cup winning teams, has played his entire career in the franchise, has six individual NHL trophies and holds the franchise record for goals, assists and points. [[Peter Forsberg]] was also on both Stanley Cup winning teams and won three individual NHL trophies while playing for the Avalanche and one when the franchise was in Quebec.
