In Greek mythology, '''Heracles''' or '''Herakles''' ("glory of [[Hera]]", or '''Alcides''', original name) "{{polytonic|Ἥρα}} + {{polytonic|κλέος}}, {{polytonic|Ἡρακλῆς}})" was a [[hero|divine hero]], the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Alcmene]], stepson of [[Amphitryon]]<ref>By his adoptive descent through Ampitryon, Heracles receives the epithet '''Alcides''', as "of the line of [[Alcaeus]]", father of Amphitryon.</ref> and great-grandson of [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]]. He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of [[Heraklids|royal clans]] and a champion of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian order]] against [[chthonic]] monsters. In [[Rome]] and the [[modernity|modern]] [[western civilization|West]], he is known as [[Hercules]], with whom the later [[Roman Emperor]]s, in particular [[Commodus]] and [[Maximinus]], often identified themselves. The Romans adopted the Greek version of his life and works essentially unchanged, but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it linking the hero with the geography of the Central Mediterranean. Details of [[cult (religion)|cult]] were adapted to Rome as well.

Extraordinary strength, [[courage]], ingenuity, and sexual prowess with both males and females were among his characteristic attributes. Although he was not as clever as the likes of [[Odysseus]] or [[Nestor]], Heracles used his wits on several occasions when his strength did not suffice, such as when laboring for King [[Augeias]], wrestling the giant [[Antaeus]], or tricking [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] into taking the sky back onto his shoulders.  Together with [[Hermes]] he was the patron and protector of [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasia]] and [[Palaestra|palaestrae]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Guide to Greece,'' 4.32.1</ref> His iconographic attributes are the [[Nemean Lion|lion skin]] and the [[Club (weapon)|club]]. These qualities did not prevent him from being regarded as a playful figure who used games to relax from his labors and played a great deal with children.<ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia,'' 12.15</ref> By conquering dangerous archaic forces he is said to have "made the world safe for mankind" and to be its benefactor.<ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia,'' 5.3</ref>

==Origin and character==
Many popular stories were told of his life, the most famous being [[The Twelve Labours|The Twelve Labours of Heracles]]; Alexandrian poets of the Hellenistic age drew his mythology into a high poetic and tragic atmosphere<ref>Burkert 1985, pp. 208-9</ref>. His figure, which initially drew on Near Eastern motifs such as the lion-fight, was known everywhere: his [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] equivalent was '''Hercle''', a son of [[Tinia]] and [[Uni]].

[[Image:Temple To Hercules.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Ruins in [[Kos]] of the temple to Heracles, the ''Herakleion'']]

The greatest of Hellenic [[chthonic]] heroes, yet unlike other Greek heroes, in that no tomb of Heracles was identified, Heracles was both hero and god, as [[Pindar]] says ''heroes theos''; at the same festival sacrifice was made to him, first as a hero, with a chthonic [[libation]], and then as a god, upon an altar: thus he embodies the closest Greek approach to a "[[demi-god]]".<ref>ibid.</ref> The core of the story of Heracles has been identified by Walter Burkert as originating in Neolithic hunter culture and traditions of [[shaman]]istic crossings into the netherworld.<ref>Burkert 1985, pp. 208-212.</ref>

===Christian dating===
In Christian circles a [[Euhemerism|Euhemerist]] reading of the widespread Heracles/Hercules cult was attributed to a historical figure who had been offered cult status after his death, Thus  [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]],  ''Preparation of the Gospel'' (10.12), [[Saint Clement|Clement]] could offer historical dates for Hercules as a king in Argos: "from the reign of Hercules in [[Argos]] to the [[deification]] of Hercules himself and of [[Asclepius]] there are comprised thirty-eight years, according to [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]] the chronicler: and from that point to the deification of [[Castor and Pollux]] fifty-three years: and somewhere about this time was the capture of [[Troy]]."

Christian readers with a literalist bent have asserted from this remark that, since Heracles ruled over [[Tiryns]] in Argos at the same time that [[Eurystheus]] ruled over [[Mycenae]], and since at about this time [[Linus]] was Heracles' teacher, one can conclude based on [[Jerome]]'s date&mdash; in his universal history, his ''Chronicon''&mdash; for Linus' notoriety in teaching Heracles in [[1260s BC|1264 BC]] that Heracles' death and deification occurred 38 years later in approximately 1226 BC.

===Cult of Heracles===
The ancient Greeks celebrated the festival of the ''[[Herakleia]]'', which commemorated the death of Heracles, on the second day of the month of Metageitnion (which would fall in late July or early August). What is believed to be an [[Egypt|Egyptian]] Temple of Heracles [http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/herculest.htm] in the [[Bahariya Oasis]] dates to 21 BC.

==Myths of Heracles==
=== Birth and childhood ===
{{Greek myth}}
A major factor in the well-known tragedies surrounding Heracles is the hatred that the [[goddess]] [[Hera]], wife of [[Zeus]], had for him. A full account of Heracles must render it clear why Heracles was so tormented by Hera, when there are many illegitimate offspring sired by Zeus. Heracles was the fruit of the affair Zeus had with the mortal woman [[Alcmene]]. [[Zeus]] made love to her after disguising himself as her husband, [[Amphitryon]], home early from war (Amphitryon did return later the same night, and Alcmene became pregnant with his son at the same time, a case of [[superfecundation]], where a woman carries twins sired by different fathers).<ref>

Compare the two pairs of twins born to [[Leda]] and the "double" parentage of [[Theseus]].</ref> Thus, Heracles's very existence proved at least one of Zeus's many illicit affairs, and Hera often conspired against Zeus's mortal offspring, as revenge for her husband's infidelities. 

On the night the twins sharing the same mother were to be born, Hera, knowing of her husband Zeus's adultery, persuaded Zeus to swear an oath that the child born that night to a member of the House of [[Perseus]] would be High King. Once the oath was sworn, Hera hurried to Alcmene's dwelling and slowed the birth by forcing Alcmene into sitting crosslegged with her clothing tied in knots. Meanwhile, she caused another boy [[Eurystheus]] to be born prematurely, making him High King in place of Heracles. She would have permanently delayed Heracles's birth had she not been foiled by [[Galanthis]], Alcmene's servant, who lied to her, saying that [[Alcmene]] had already delivered the baby. Upon hearing this Hera jumped in surprise, therefore untying the knots and finally allowing [[Alcmene]] to give birth.

One of the boys, [[Iphicles]], was Amphitryon's son and a [[mortal]], while the other was the [[demi-god]] Heracles. The child was originally given the name Alcides by his parents; it was only later on that he became known as Heracles.<ref>By his adoptive descent through Ampitryon, Heracles receives the epithet '''Alcides''', as "of the line of [[Alcaeus]]", father of Amphitryon.</ref> He was renamed Heracles in an unsuccessful attempt to mollify Hera. A few months after he was born, Hera sent two serpents to kill him as he lay in his cot.  Heracles throttled a snake in each hand and was found by his nurse playing with their limp bodies as if they were child's toys.

===Youth===
After killing his music tutor with a [[lyre]], he was sent to tend cattle on a mountain by his foster father [[Amphitryon]]. Here, he was visited by two nymphs - Pleasure and Virtue - who offered him a choice between a pleasant and easy life or a severe but glorious life. He chose the latter. One of Heracles's challenges was put to him by King [[Thespius]] of [[Thespia]] who wished him to kill the Lion of Cithaeron. As a reward, the king offered him the chance to impregnate each of his 50 daughters. Accordingly, Heracles did this in one night (sometimes referred to as his 13th Labour). 

Later in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], Heracles married King [[Creon]]'s daughter, [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]]. However, Hera drove Heracles into a fit of madness during which he killed their children. Upon realizing what he had done, he fled to the [[Delphi|Oracle of Delphi]]. Unbeknownst to him, the Oracle was guided by Hera. He was directed to serve King [[Eurystheus]] for 12 years and perform any task which he required, resulting in the Twelve Labours of Heracles.

===Twelve Labors===
{{main|Twelve Labours}}

In a fit of madness induced by [[Hera]], Heracles slew his own and his brother's children. To expiate the crime, Heracles was required to carry out ten labors set by his arch-enemy, [[Eurystheus]], who had become king in Heracles' place. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Hera ordered Eurystheus to give two more tasks to Heracles, which he then carried out.

Not all writers gave the labors in the same order.  [[Apollodorus]] (2.5.1-2.5.12) gives the following order:
#The [[Nemean Lion]].
#The [[Lernaean Hydra]].
#The [[Ceryneian Hind]].
#The [[Erymanthian Boar]].
#The [[Augeas|Augean]] Stables.
#The [[Stymphalian Birds]].
#The [[Cretan Bull]].
#The [[Mares of Diomedes]].
#The Girdle of [[Hippolyte]].
#The Cattle of [[Geryon]].
#The Apples of the [[Hesperides]].
#The Capture of [[Cerberus]], the guardian dog of [[Hades]].

===Further adventures===
After completing these tasks, Heracles joined the [[Argonauts]] in the search of the [[Golden Fleece]]. They rescued heroines, conquered Troy, and helped the gods fight against the [[Gigantes]]. He also fell in love with Princess [[Iole]] of [[Oechalia]]. Heracles' advances were spurned by the king and his sons, except for one - Iole's brother [[Iphitus]]. Iphitus became Heracles best friend. But once again, Hera drove Heracles mad and he threw Iphitus over the city wall to his death. Once again, Heracles purified himself through servitude - this time to Queen [[Omphale]] of [[Lydia]].

===Omphale===
[[Omphale]] was a queen or princess of [[Lydia]].  As penalty for a murder, Heracles was her slave. He was forced to do women's work and wear women's clothes, while she wore the skin of the [[Nemean Lion]] and carried his [[olive-wood]] club. After some time, Omphale freed Heracles and married him. Some sources mention a son born to them who is variously named. For further details see [[Omphale]]. It was at that time that the [[cercopes]], mischievous wood spirits, stole Heracles' weapons. He punished them by tying them to a stick with their faces pointing downward.

===Hylas===
While walking through the wilderness, Heracles was set upon by the [[Dryopians]]. He killed their king, [[Theiodamas]], and the others gave up and offered him Prince [[Hylas]]. He took the youth on as his weapons bearer and beloved. Years later, Heracles and Hylas joined the crew of the [[Argo]]. As [[Argonauts]], they only participated in part of the journey. In [[Mysia]], [[Hylas]] was kidnapped by a nymph.  Heracles, heartbroken, searched for a long time but Hylas had fallen in love with the nymphs and never showed up again. The ship set sail without them. [http://www.androphile.org/preview/Library/Mythology/Greek/Hercules/Hylas/Hylas.htm Story of Heracles and Hylas]

===Iole===
King [[Eurytus]] of [[Oechalia]] promised his daughter, [[Iole]], to whoever could beat his sons in an archery contest. Heracles won but Eurytus abandoned his promise. Heracles killed him and his sons–excluding [[Iphitus]]–and abducted Iole.

===Laomedon of Troy===
Before the [[Trojan War]], [[Poseidon]] sent a sea monster to attack [[Troy]]. The story is related in several digressions in the ''Iliad'' (7.451-453, 20.145-148, 21.442-457) and is also found in Apollodorus' [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke]] (2.5.9). [[Laomedon]] planned on sacrificing his daughter [[Hesione]] to Poseidon in the hope of appeasing him. Heracles happened to arrive (along with [[Telamon]] and [[Oicles]]) and agreed to kill the monster if Laomedon would give him the horses received from Zeus as compensation for Zeus' kidnapping [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]. Laomedon agreed. Heracles killed the monster, but Laomedon went back on his word. Accordingly, in a later expedition, Heracles and his followers attacked Troy and sacked it. Then they slew all Laomedon's sons present there save [[Podarces]], who saved his own life by giving Heracles a golden veil Hesione had made. Telamon took Hesione as a war prize; they were married and had a son, [[Teucer]].

===Other adventures===
* Heracles defeated the [[Bebryces]] (ruled by King [[Mygdon]]) and gave their land to Prince [[Lycus]] of [[Mysia]], son of [[Dascylus]].
* He killed the robber [[Termerus]].
* Heracles visited [[Evander]] with [[Antor]], who then stayed in Italy.
* Heracles killed King [[Amyntor]] of the [[Dolopes]] for not allowing him into his kingdom.  He also killed King [[Emathion]] of [[Arabia]].
* Heracles killed [[Lityerses]] after beating him in a contest of harvesting. 
* Heracles killed [[Poriclymenus]] at [[Pylos]].
* Heracles founded the city [[Tarentum]] (modern: [[Taranto]]) in Italy.
* Heracles learned music from [[Linus]] (and [[Eumolpus]]), but killed him after Linus corrected his mistakes.  He learned how to wrestle from [[Autolycus]].  He killed the famous boxer [[Eryx]] of [[Sicily]] in a match.
* Heracles was an [[Argonauts|Argonaut]].  He killed [[Alastor]] and his brothers.
* When [[Hippocoon]] overthrew his brother, [[Tyndareus]], as King of [[Sparta]], Heracles reinstated the rightful ruler and killed Hippocoon and his sons.
* Heracles slew the giants [[Cycnus]], [[Porphyrion]] and [[Mimas]]. The expedition against Cycnus, in which Iolaus accompanied Heracles, is the ostensible theme of a short epic attributed to [[Hesiod]], ''[[The Shield of Heracles]]''.
* Heracles went to war with [[Augeias]] after he denied him a promised reward for clearing his stables. Augeias remained undefeated due to the skill of his two generals, the Molionides, and after Heracles fell ill, his army was badly beaten. Later, however, he was able to ambush and kill the Molionides, and thus march into Elis, sack it, and kill Augeias and his sons.
* Heracles visited the house of [[Admetus]] on the day Admetus' wife, [[Alcestis]], had agreed to die in his place. By hiding beside the grave of Alcestis, Heracles was able to surprise Death when he came to collect her, and by squeezing him tight until he relented, was able to persuade Death to return Alcestis to her husband.

==Marriage, liaisons and death==
Heracles had numerous liaisons with women. Some of these were linked with later dynasties which claimed descent from his offspring, collectively referred to as the [[Heracleidae]].

===Heracles' women===
During the course of his life, Heracles married four times. His first marriage was to [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]], whose three children he murdered in a fit of madness and whom he later gave in marriage to his beloved [[Iolaus]], because the sight of her was too painful. His second wife was [[Omphale]], the [[Lydia]]n queen or princess to whom he was delivered as a slave. 

His third marriage was to [[Deianira]], for whom he had to fight the river god [[Achelous]]. (Upon Achelous' death, Heracles removed one of his horns and gave it to some nymphs who turned it into the [[cornucopia]].) Soon after they wed, Heracles and Deianira had to cross a river, and a [[centaur]] named [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]] offered to help Deianira across but then attempted to rape her. Enraged, Heracles shot the centaur from the opposite shore with a poisoned arrow (tipped with the Lernaean Hydra's blood) and killed him. As he lay dying, Nessus plotted revenge and told Deianira to gather up his blood and spilled semen and, if she ever wanted to prevent Heracles from having affairs with other women, she should apply them to his vestments. Nessus knew that his blood had become tainted by the poisonous blood of the Hydra, and would burn through the skin of anyone it touched.

[[Image:Francisco de Zurbarán 013.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Hercules'', by [[Francisco de Zurbarán]]]]

Later, when Deianira suspected that Heracles was fond of Iole, she soaked a shirt of his in the mixture.  Heracles' servant, [[Lichas]], brought him the shirt and he put it on. Instantly he was in agony, the cloth burning into him. As he tried to remove it, the flesh ripped from his bones. Heracles chose a voluntary death, asking that a pyre be built for him to end his suffering. After death the gods transformed him into an immortal, or alternatively, the fire burned away the mortal part of the demi-god, so that only the god remained. Because his mortal parts had been incinerated, he could now become a full god and join his father and the other Olympians on [[Mount Olympus]]. He then married [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]].

No one but Heracles' friend [[Philoctetes]] (in some versions: [[Iolaus]] or [[Poeas]]) would light his funeral pyre.  For this action, Philoctetes (or Poeas) received Heracles' bow and arrows, which were later needed by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the Trojan War.
Philoctetes confronted Paris and shot a poisoned arrow at him. The Hydra poison would subsequently lead to the death of Paris. The Trojan War, however, would continue until the [[Trojan Horse]] was used to defeat [[Troy]].

Another episode of his female affairs that stands out was his stay at the palace of King Thespios, who encouraged Heracles to make love to his daughters, all fifty of them, in one night. They all got pregnant and all bore sons. Many of the kings of ancient Greece traced their lines to one or another of these, notably the kings of [[Sparta]] and [[Macedon]].

===Heracles' ''eromenoi''===
[[Image:Heracles, Iolaus and Eros - Cista Ficoroni foot.jpg|thumb|200px|Heracles and [[Iolaus]], with [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] between them.<br>4th c. BCE [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] ritual vessel]]

As paragon of masculinity and warriorship, Heracles also had a number of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] male beloveds. [[Plutarch]], in his ''Eroticos,'' maintains that Heracles' [[eromenos|eromenoi]] (male lovers) were beyond counting. Of these, the one most closely linked to Heracles is the [[Thebes|Theban]] [[Iolaus]]. Their story, an [[rite of passage|initiatory]] myth thought to be of ancient origin, contains many of the elements of the Greek pederastic apprenticeship in which the older warrior is the educator and the younger his helper in battle. Thus, Iolaus is Heracles's charioteer and squire. Also in keeping with the initiatory pattern of the relationship, Heracles in the end gave his pupil a wife, symbolizing his entry into adulthood. Iolaus's ritual functions paralleled his relationship with Heracles. He was a patron of male love&mdash;Plutarch reports that down to his own time, male couples would go to Iolaus's tomb in Thebes to swear an oath of loyalty to the hero and to each other<ref>Plutarch, ''Erotikos,'' 761d.</ref>&mdash;and he presided over initiations in the historical era, such as the one at [[Agyrion]] in central [[Sicily]].<ref>[[Bernard Sergent]], ''Homosexuality in Greek Myth,'' Boston, 1986, pp. 141-152.</ref> The tomb of Iolaus is also mentioned by Pindar.<ref>Pindar, ''Olympian Odes,'' 9.98-99.</ref>

One of Heracles's best known love affairs, and one frequently represented in ancient as well as modern art, is the one with [[Hylas]]. Though it is of more recent vintage (dated to the third century) than that with Iolaus, it too exemplifies in detail the normal cycle of a youth's initiatory process, consisting of education through service to a warrior, including sexual relations, and concluding with promotion to adult status and marriage. <ref>[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''Argonautica,'' 1.1177-1357; [[Theocritus]], ''Idyll'' 13.</ref> [http://www.androphile.org/preview/Library/Mythology/Greek/Hercules/Hylas/Hylas.htm]

[[Sparta]], as a warrior city where [[pederastic]] [[pedagogy]]&mdash;ostensibly of a chaste nature&mdash;was enshrined in the laws given by [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]], the legendary legislator, also provided Heracles with an [[eromenos]]&mdash;[[Elacatas]], who was honored there with a sanctuary and yearly games. The myth of their love is an ancient one.<ref>Sosibius, in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s ''Lexicon'', per Sergent, 1986, p. 163</ref>  [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]]'s eponymous hero, [[Abderus]], was another of Heracles' beloveds. In what is considered to be initiatory myth, he was said to have been entrusted with&mdash;and slain by&mdash;the carnivorous mares of Thracian [[Mares of Diomedes|Diomedes]]. Heracles founded the city of Abdera in [[Thrace]] in his memory, where he was honored with athletic games. The topos of death in such stories is thought to symbolize the passage from one stage of life to another. <ref>[[Apollodorus]] 2.5.8; [[Ptolemaeus Chennus]], 147b, in [[Photius]]' ''Bibliotheca''</ref>

Among the lesser-known myths is that of [[Iphitus]]. Heracles' subsequent murder of Iphitus is held to be evocative of an initiatory ritual.<ref>Ptolemaeus Chennus, in [[Photius]]' ''Bibliotheca''; Sergent 1986, p. 297.</ref> Another such story is the one of his love for [[Nireus]], who was "the most beautiful man who came beneath Ilion" (''Iliad'', 673). Ptolemy adds that certain authors made Nireus out to be a son of Heracles, a fact thought to authenticate this tradition.<ref>Ptolemaeus Chennus, 147b; Sergent 1986, p. 298.</ref> The last in this category&mdash;despite the fact that Greek literature preserves no mention of this role&mdash;is the story of [[Philoctetes]]. He is also heir to the hero&mdash;and thus surely his disciple&mdash;and is the one who lights his pyre. Later he is the initiator of [[Neoptolemus]], son of [[Achilles]].<ref>[[Martial]], ''Epigrams'' 2.84.</ref>

There is also a series of lovers who are either later inventions or purely literary conceits. Among these are [[Admetus]], who assisted in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]];<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Erotikos,'' 761e.</ref> [[Adonis]];<ref>Ptolemaeus Chennus</ref> [[Corythus]];<ref>Ptolemaeus Chennus</ref> and [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], who was said to have been loved for his wisdom. His role as eromenos was perhaps to explain why he was the only son of [[Neleus]] to be spared by the hero.<ref>Ptolemaeus Chennus, 147e; [[Philostratus]], ''Heroicus'' 696, per Sergent]], 1986, p. 163.</ref>

===Heracles' children===
{{Main|Heracleidae}}
[[Telephus]] is the son of Heracles and [[Auge]].
[[Hyllus]] is the son of Heracles and [[Deianeira]] or [[Melite]].
The sons of Heracles and [[Hebe]] are [[Alexiares and Anicetus]].

==Heracles in Rome==
{{main|Hercules}}
In Rome, Heracles was honored as ''Hercules'', and had a number of distinctively Roman myths and practices associated with him under that name. 

==Modern and ancient interpretations==
Via the [[Greco-Buddhist]] culture, Heraclean symbolism was transmitted to the far east. An example remains to this day in the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of [[Japan]]ese Buddhist temples. [[Herodotus]] connected Heracles both to [[Phoenicia]]n god [[Melqart]] and to the [[Egypt]]ian god [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]]. Temples dedicated to Heracles abounded all along the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coastal countries.  For example the temple of ''Heracles Monoikos'' (i.e. the lone dweller), built far from any nearby town upon a promontory in what is now the [[Cote d'Azur]], gave its name to the area's more recent name, [[Monaco]].

Heracles was canonized by [[Aleister Crowley]] as a saint in [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]].  

[[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]] appeared as a villain in the pages of ''[[Wonder Woman]]''.

Hercules is the mentor and ancestor of Herry Hercules from [[Class of the Titans]]

There is a Marvel Comics superhero named [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], that is a member of the superhero team The Avengers. He claims to be the god of strength himself, decended from Olympus.

[[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]] has appeared in several movies, such as a Disney animated movie that was loosely based on his myths, and the cult classic Jason and the Argonauts, where he appeard as a member of crew of the ''Argo'', searching for the golden fleece.
