'''Matthew Abram Groening''' ({{IPA2|gɹeɪnɪŋ}}, pronounced grey-ning) (born [[February 15]] [[1954]]) is an American [[cartoonist]], television producer and writer from [[Portland, Oregon]]. Groening is best known as the creator of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' . He is also the creator of ''[[Futurama]]'' and the author of the weekly comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]''.  Groening distributed ''Life in Hell'' in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, a [[record store]] in which he worked. He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde [[Wet (magazine)|''Wet'' magazine]] in 1978. The cartoon is still carried in 250 weekly newspapers.
 
''Life in Hell'' caught the attention of [[James L. Brooks]]. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in [[animation]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] variety show ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his ''Life in Hell'' characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family, [[Simpsons family|the Simpsons]] and named the members after his own parents and sisters &mdash; while Bart was an anagram of the word brat. The shorts would be spun off into their own series: ''The Simpsons'', which has since aired over 400 episodes in 19 seasons. In 1997, Groening got together with [[David X. Cohen]] and developed ''[[Futurama]]'', an animated series about life in the year 3000, which premiered in 1999. After four years on the air, the show was cancelled by Fox, but [[Comedy Central]] commissioned 16 new episodes to be aired in 2008.

Groening has won 10 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], nine for ''The Simpsons'' and one for ''Futurama'' as well as a [[British Comedy Awards|British Comedy Award]] for "outstanding contribution to comedy" in 2004. In 2002, he won the [[National Cartoonist Society]] [[Reuben Award]] for his work on ''Life in Hell''.

==Career==
In 1977, at the age of 23, Groening moved to [[Los Angeles]] to become a [[writer]].

[[Image:Life-in-Hell-No-4.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Life In Hell'' No. 4, published in 1978.]]

Groening described life in Los Angeles to his friends in the form of a self-published [[comic book]] entitled ''Life in Hell'', which was loosely inspired by a chapter entitled "How to Go to Hell" in [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann's]] book ''Critique of Religion and Philosophy''.<ref name="mygeneration">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening | date=May -June 2001 | last=McKenna | first=Kristine | work=My Generation | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening01a.html | accessmonthday=[[February 3]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref> Groening distributed the comic book in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, a [[record store]] in which he worked.

Groening gained employment at the ''[[Los Angeles Reader]]'', a newly formed [[alternative newspaper]], delivering papers,<ref name=tcj/> typesetting, editing and answering phones.<ref name=metroactive/> He showed his cartoons to the editor, James Vowell, who was impressed and eventually gave him a spot in the paper.<ref name=tcj/> ''Life in Hell'' made its official debut as a comic strip in the ''Reader'' on April 25, 1980.<ref name="latimesmag"/><ref name="aan">{{cite web |url=http://www.aan.org/gyrobase/Aan/viewCompany?oid=oid%3A1157 |title=Acme Features Syndicate |accessdate=2007-08-30 |work=Association of Alternative Newsweeklies }}</ref>

Vowell also gave Groening his own weekly music column, "Sound Mix," in 1982. However, the column would rarely actually be about music, as he would often write about his "various enthusiasms, obsessions, [[pet peeves]] and problems" instead.<ref name="laweekly"/> In an effort to add more music to the column, he "just made stuff up,"<ref name="playboy"/> concocting and reviewing fictional bands and non-existent records. In the following week's column, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column and swear that everything in the new column was true. Eventually, he was finally asked to give up the "music" column.<ref name="royale">{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |title=Simpsons Comics Royale |chapter=My Rock 'n' Roll Life, Part One: So You Want To Snort Derisively |pages=92-93 |year=2001 |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |isbn=0-060-93378-X}}</ref>

Groening [[storyboard]]ed and scripted every short (now known as ''[[The Simpsons shorts]]''), which were then [[animation|animated]] by a team including [[David Silverman]] and [[Wes Archer]], both of whom would later become [[Film director|directors]] on the series.<ref name="silverman">{{cite web | title=The David Silverman Interview | last=Heintjes | first=Tom | work=Hogan's Alley | url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp | accessmonthday=[[January 13]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref> The shorts premiered on ''The Tracey Ullman'' show on [[April 19]], [[1987]]. 

Although ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' was not a big hit,<ref name=vanityfair/> the popularity of the shorts led to a half-hour [[spin-off]] in 1989. The [[The Simpsons|series]] quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, to the surprise of many. Groening said: "Nobody thought ''The Simpsons'' was going to be a big hit. It sneaked up on everybody."<ref name="laweekly"/>

''The Simpsons'' was co-developed by Groening, Brooks, and [[Sam Simon]], a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked with on previous projects. Groening and Simon, however, did not get along<ref name=vanityfair/> and were often in conflict over the show;<ref name=latimesmag/> Groening once described their relationship as "very contentious."<ref name="nytimes"/> Simon eventually left the show in 1993 over creative differences.<ref name="ew">{{cite web |title=Conan on being left out of "Simpsons Movie" |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20046980,00.html |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=2007-07-18 |accessmonthday=[[September 4]] |accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref>

Although Groening has pitched a number of [[spin-off]]s of ''The Simpsons'', those attempts have been unsuccessful. In 1994, Groening and other ''Simpsons'' producers pitched a [[live-action]] [[spin-off]] about [[Krusty the Clown]] (with [[Dan Castellaneta]] playing the lead role), but were unsuccessful in getting it off the ground.<ref name=avclub/><ref name="npr">From a radio interview with Groening that aired on the [http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&prgDate=22-Apr-98 April 22, 1998 edition] of ''[[Fresh Air]]'' on [[NPR]]. [http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/fa/19980422.fa.ram Link to stream] (''13 minutes, 21 seconds in'')</ref> Groening has also pitched "Young [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]" and a spin-off about the non-Simpsons citizens of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]].<ref name=shortfilms>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Oakley, Bill;, Weinstein, Josh; Appel, Richard; Cohen, David; Pulido, Rachel; Smith, Yeardley; Reardon, Jim; Silverman, David|year=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

In 1995, Groening got into a major disagreement with [[James L. Brooks|Brooks]] and other ''Simpsons'' producers over ''[[A Star Is Burns]]'', a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] episode with ''[[The Critic]]'', an animated show also produced by Brooks and staffed with many former ''Simpsons'' crew members. Groening claimed that he feared viewers would "see it as nothing but a pathetic attempt to advertise ''The Critic'' at the expense of ''The Simpsons''," and was concerned about the possible implication that he had created or produced ''The Critic''.<ref name="flux">{{cite web | title=Life in Hell | work=Flux Magazine | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening95.html | last=Paul | first=Alan | date=[[1995-09-30]] | accessmonthday=[[December 26]] | accessyear=[[2005]]}}</ref> He requested his name be taken off the episode.<ref name="latimes">{{cite web |title=Matt Groening's Reaction to The Critic's First Appearance on The Simpsons |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.critic.nohomers.net/Special_Extras_Matt_Groening_Reaction.html |last=Brennan |first=Judy |date=1995-03-03 |accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref>

Groening is credited with writing or co-writing the episodes "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons episode)|Some Enchanted Evening]]", "[[The Telltale Head]]", "[[Colonel Homer]]" and "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]", as well as ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', released in 2007.<ref name="variety>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940840?categoryid=14&cs=1|title=Homer going to bat in '07|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Fleming, Michael|date=[[2006-04-02]]|publisher=Variety.com}}</ref> He has had several [[cameo appearance]]s in the show, with a speaking role in the episode "[[My Big Fat Geek Wedding]]".

====''The Simpsons'' character names====
Groening famously named the main Simpson characters after members of his own family: his parents, Homer and Margaret (Marge or Marjorie in full), and his younger sisters, Lisa and Margaret (Maggie). Claiming that it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself, he chose the name "Bart," an [[anagram]] of brat.<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|year=2000|title=The Simpsons: America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="radiotimes">{{cite web ||last=Duncan |first=Andrew |title=Matt Groening |work=[[Radio Times]] | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening99c.html | date=September 18-24 1999 | accessmonthday=[[September 19]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref> However, he stresses that aside from some of the [[sibling rivalry]], his family is nothing like the Simpsons.<ref name="Planet Simpson">{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Chris | title=Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation | id=ISBN 0-679-31318-4}}</ref> Groening also has an older brother and sister, Mark and Patty, but their names were not used,<ref name=prodigy/> although he divulged that Mark "is the actual inspiration for Bart" in a 1995 interview.<ref name="flux"/> When it came time to give [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa Simpson]] a first name, Groening says he refused to name him after his own grandfather, Abraham Groening, leaving it to other writers to choose a name.

===''Futurama''===
{{Main|Futurama}}
After spending a few years researching [[science fiction]], Groening got together with ''Simpsons'' writer/producer [[David X. Cohen]] (still known as David S. Cohen at the time) in 1997 and developed ''[[Futurama]]'', an animated series about life in the year 3000.<ref name="motherjones"/><ref name="theface">{{cite journal |last=Needham |first=Alex |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20000824051707/www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html |title=Nice Planet...We'll Take It! |journal=The Face }issue=33 |date=October 1999}}</ref> By the time they pitched the series to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and [[storyline]]s; Groening claimed they had gone "overboard" in their discussions.<ref name="theface"/> Groening described trying to get the show on the air as "by far the worst experience of [his] grown-up life."<ref name="motherjones"/> 

The show premiered on March 28, 1999. After four years on the air, the show was cancelled by Fox. However, in a similar situation to ''[[Family Guy]]'', strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Teletoon (Canada)|Teletoon]] brought Futurama back to life, which is slated for four [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] movies, as confirmed by Groening in an April 2006 interview.<ref name="avclub"/> [[Comedy Central]] commissioned 16 new episodes (edited from the four movies) to be aired in 2008.<ref name=reuters>{{cite web|author=Wallenstein, Andrew|url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/va/20060622/115104459800.html|title="Futurama" gets new life on Comedy Central|publisher=Reuters|date=[[June 22]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref>

Groening's sole writing credit for the show was the premiere episode, "[[Space Pilot 3000]]", co-written with Cohen.

===Other pursuits===
In 1994, Groening formed [[Bongo Comics|Bongo Comics Group]] (named after the character Bongo from ''[[Life in Hell]]''<ref name="royale3">{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |title=Simpsons Comics Royale |chapter=The Secret Life of Lisa Simpson |pages=128 |year=2001 |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |isbn=0-060-93378-X}}</ref>) with [[Steve Vance]], [[Cindy Vance]] and [[Bill Morrison (comics)|Bill Morrison]], which publishes comic books based on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'' (including ''Futurama Simpsons Infinitely Secret Crossover Crisis'', a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] between the two), as well as a few original titles.
