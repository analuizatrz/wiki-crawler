== Secret Moves ==
*Royal Demon Rose: Aphrodite uses red roses as a projectile. Upon being struck by the thorns on the roses or smelling their fragrance, it would poison them until they slowly loose their 5 senses and fall into a sweet aroma of death. Aphrodite mentioned that these roses were used for protecting palaces in ancient times (hence the name), and he has similarly laid the exit of his Temple with a garden of these.
*Pirahna Rose: Aphrodite uses black roses as a projectile. Upon impact, it would break anything in its touch.
*Bloody Rose: Aphrodite uses a white rose as a projectile. It would strike at the opponent's chest, and drain all the blood from their heart. As the white rose draws blood, it eventually becomes red. This is Aphrodite's strongest attack.

==The attacks of a perfectionist==
Though he looked beautiful like a woman, he is very much a narcissistic man. Aphrodite claims to be the most beautiful creature other than Athena, and that "even the stars in the sky will loose their luster compared to him." He was named after the [[Aphrodite|Greek Goddess of love and beauty]] to reflect on this. Despite his narcistic nature, he is as cruel as his fellow Gold Saint, [[Cancer Deathmask]], but not as sadistic.

{{spoiler}}

Just like [[Cancer Deathmask]] (and [[Capricorn Shura]] in the manga), he knew the true identity of the [[Gemini Saga|Grand Pope Ares]], but still chose to pledge alliance to him.

== Roses Versus Chain ==
As guardian of the final Temple of Sanctuary, Pisces Aphrodite faces the last two Bronze Saints remaining: [[Pegasus Seiya]] and [[Andromeda Shun]]. Shun stated that he would hold Aphrodite off, while Seiya manages to pass through the temple. Aphrodite laughs and tells Shun that even though Seiya passes through the temple, between it and the Pope's hall, he has a garden of Royal Demon Roses, and as Seiya has to pass through them, he would eventually lose his senses and die. As the two fought, Aphrodite revealed that he was the Gold Saint who attacked Andromeda Island and killed Shun's master, Cepheus Daidalos. Knowing about these facts, the normally kind and pacifist Shun was enraged, and vowed to defeat Aphrodite.

''*Note:(though it was originally [[Scorpio Milo]] that was sent to attack, Aphrodite was the one to have fought Shun's master. But the Silver Saint proved too much problems for Milo and was secretly poisoned by Aphrodite through one of his roses which managed to pierce his hand - enabling an easy victory for Milo).'' 

Using his '''Rolling Defence''', Shun managed to repell of all Aphrodite's '''Royal Demon Rose attack'''. However, when Aphrodite used his '''Pirahna Rose''' on Shun, his Nebula Chains and Bronze Cloth was shattered. Although he seemed to be defenseless, Shun remembered that his master, Cepheus Daidalos, mentioned that he had an extremely powerful cosmo in him, normally restrained by the Andromeda Cloth. This power could only be awakened when he is without his Cloth. Using the power of his hidden cosmos, Shun discovered a new attack: '''Nebula Storm''', which he used to pin down Aphrodite.  Being merciful in nature, Shun gave Aphrodite a chance to repent, but Aphrodite shows no intention to do so, and prepares his strongest attack, the '''Bloody Rose'''. Shun was forced to counter with his final attack "Nebula Storm" and ended up killing him, but not without being struck in the center of his heart by the Bloody Rose, falling into near-death conditions. The Bloody Rose was true to its name as it was sucking all the blood from Shun's heart. It was not until the start of the Asgard/Poseidon arc that he managed to recover.

== The Hades War and Redemption ==
[[Image:hades_pisces_face.jpg|thumb|250px|Given by Hades, new dark version of the Pisces Cloth]]
The deceased Gold Saints were revived as Spectres by the power of Hades, and, lead by the Spectre of former Pope, [[Aries Shion]], they were sent to Sanctuary to assassinate Athena. In the first Temple, Shion was stopped by [[Aries Mu]]. Shion orders [[Cancer Deathmask]] and [[Pisces Aphrodite]] to defeat Mu so they could continue their mission. However, neither Gold Saint was able to break Mu's Crystal Wall until Shion does so himself. Deathmasks beats Mu around for a moment until Seiya arrives and interferes, but Mu tells Seiya that he is not needed for this battle, and banishes him with his Starlight '''Extinction'''. Pleased with what Mu has done, Deathmask and Aphrodite attempts to pass the temple, but Mu tells them that he would kill any enemy who dares to cross the Aries Temple. Mu quickly banishes Deathmask and Aphrodite with his '''Starlight Extinction'''.

Back in Hades' castle, Wyvern Rhadamanthys, one of the 3 Judges of Hell, punishes the two for failing their mission, and casts them back into the abyss to hell.

Later on, it was revealed that Deathmask and Aphrodite were secretly on Athena's side, along with the rest of the deceased Gold Saints, and were asked by Shion to pretend to follow Hades' order (in the Anime, after Shion asked all the dead Gold and Silver Saints to pretend to follow Hades' order, Aphrodite's smiled and Deathmask gave a smiley grin. Shion then thanked all of them for carrying the burden of the traitor's branding in pretending to betray Athena).

In the final gathering of the 12 Gold Saints at the Wall of Sighs, Aphrodite's spirit and the Gold Cloth of Pisces appeared to help open the gateway to Elysion, where Hades' true body lies. After this, his spirit and cosmo disappeared, and all that was evident of him was the Pisces Gold Cloth which remained.

== Pisces Albafica ==
As seen in the [[Saint Seiya#Saint_Seiya_-_The_Lost_Canvas|The Lost Canvas manga]], {{nihongo|Albafica|アルバフィカ|Arubafika}} is the name of the Pisces Saint living in the 18th Century.<br />
Keeper of the 12th Temple, protecting it with poisonous roses, has developed an immunity to poisons so high his own blood became poisonous.<br />
He defeat the Specter Deep Niobe of the Terrestrial Darkness Star with the attack Crimson Thorn.<br />
He's easily killed by Griffin Minos of the Celestial Nobility Star's Cosmic Marionation attack<br />

[[Saint Seiya#Saint_Seiya_-_The_Lost_Canvas|The Lost Canvas manga]] status as canon is unknown. 

:Note: there is not an official transliteration of the Saint's name. Albafica is a fan-transliteration based on the katakana, but it may differ from the official spelling, that hasn't been announced yet other than in katakana.
===Secret Moves===
*Royal Demon Rose
*Piranhan Rose
*Bloody Rose
**All the attacks are the same as Aphrodite's, though Albafica's Royal Demon Roses aren't painless.
*Crimson Thorn: This attack is first seen in the Lost Canvas chapter featuring the fight between Albafrica (The Pisces saint at the time) and Deep Niobe. The attack generates a poisonous rose-shaped cloud from Albafica's blood and unleashes a deadly poisonous rain that cuts through the enermy.

== Trivia ==
*Aside from using roses as his weapons, Aphrodite also has teleportation abilities, first used in his battle with Shun in the Sanctuary Chapter and used it again in the Saint Seiya Crimson Youth movie (or literally translate as True Red Youth) when he fight with Shun once again. However, it is stated that all Gold Saints possess some degree of telekinetic powers.
*In most of the manga/anime and all of the movies they appeared in, Aphrodite and Deathmask were portrayed to be hopelessly evil Gold Saints
*Aphrodite has a [[beauty mark]], another reference to his famous beauty in Sanctuary. Albafica has not.
*Aphrodite was voiced by the same seiyuu as [[Zoisite (Sailor Moon)|Zoisite]] in [[Sailor Moon]], who has a similarly feminine and narcistic personality
*One short made-up story was about the "Water element" Saint. It shows that one day [[Cancer Deathmask]] could not find his armor, so he when around and asked Scorpio Milo, Milo also lost his armor so they both run around looking for the armors and eventually Aphrodite showed up who was also looking for his armor. All three of them was wondering what could have happened to their armor and just then Aphrodite spoted all 3 armors running off to play together and then run toward the cliff and jumped into the ocean. The next scene shows that Master [[Dohko]] is fishing at the water fall and caught all 3 armors one attached after another and saying "wow, we'll have a great dinner tonight".
