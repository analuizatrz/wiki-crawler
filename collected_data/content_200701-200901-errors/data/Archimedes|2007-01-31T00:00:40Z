'''Archimedes'''  ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Άρχιμήδης}}; c. [[287 BC]] – c. [[212 BC]]) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[engineer]], [[astronomer]], and [[philosopher]].

Many consider Archimedes one of the greatest, if not the greatest, mathematicians in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], himself frequently called the most influential mathematician of all time, modestly claimed that  Archimedes was one of the three epoch-making mathematicians (the others being [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Ferdinand Eisenstein]]). Apart from his fundamental theoretical contributions to maths, Archimedes also shaped the fields of physics and practical engineering, and has been called "The greatest scientist ever".<ref>{{cite web|title=  Archimedes (287-212 B.C.), Greatest Scientist Ever"  [[Jürgen Schmidhuber|by J. Schmidhuber]] | url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/archimedes.html | accessmonthday=October 11 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

He was a relative of the Hiero monarchy, which was the ruling family of Syracuse, a seaport kingdom. King [[Hiero II]], who was said to be Archimedes's uncle, commissioned him to design and build a new class of ships for his navy, which were crucial for the preservation of the ruling class in Syracuse. Hiero had promised large caches of grain to the Romans in the north in return for peace. Faced with war when unable to present the promised amount, Hiero commissioned Archimedes to develop a large luxury/supply/war barge in order to serve the changing requirements of his navy. It is said that the [[Archimedes screw]] was an invention of happenstance, as he needed a tool to remove bilge water. The ship, named ''Syracusia'', after its nation, was huge, and its construction caused stupor in the Greek world.<ref>[[Athenaeus]], ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', v, 207b.</ref>

He is credited with many inventions and discoveries, some of which are still in use today, like his [[Archimedes screw]]. He designed the compound pulley, a system of pulleys used to lift heavy loads such as ships. Although Archimedes did not invent the [[lever]], he gave the first rigorous explanation of the principles involved, which are the transmission of force through a [[fulcrum]] and moving the effort applied through a greater distance than the object to be moved.  His ''Law of the Lever'' states: ''Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights''.  His work on levers caused him to remark famously: "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth."  [https://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Lever/LeverIntro.html]  He designed several war machines for his patron King Hiero II and produced work in geometry, which included finding the surface areas and volumes of solids accurately. He also laid down the laws of flotation and described [[Archimedes's principle]], which states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.<ref>Eminent scientists, Published by scholastic India pvt. Ltd.</ref>

==Biography==
He was born circa [[287 BC]] in the Grecian seaport colony of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Magna Graecia]]. In his work ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' he gives his father's name as Phidias, an astronomer about whom nothing is known. Plutarch wrote that Archimedes was also related to King Hieron II of Syracuse. Heracleides, a friend of Archimedes, apparently wrote a biography of Archimedes, but this work has become lost. Thus many details of his life remain incomplete.<ref name="mactutor">{{cite web | author=J. J. O'Connor, E. F. Robertson | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Archimedes.html | title = Archimedes of Syracuse | publisher = University of St Andrews | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref>

Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier during the sack of Syracuse during the [[Second Punic War]], despite orders from the Roman general [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]] that he was not to be harmed. The Greeks said that he was killed while performing a geometric construction in the sand; engrossed in his diagram and impatient with being interrupted, he is said to have muttered his [[Wikiquote:Last words|famous last words]] before being slain by an enraged Roman soldier: Μη μου τους κύκλους τάραττε ("Don't disturb my circles").  The phrase is often given in [[Latin]] as "''Noli turbare circulos meos''" but there is no direct evidence that Archimedes ever uttered these words.  This story was sometimes told to contrast the Greek high-mindedness with Roman ham-handedness; however, it should be noted that Archimedes designed the siege engines that devastated a substantial Roman invasion force, so his death may have been out of retribution.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Death/Histories.html | title = Death of Archimedes: Sources | publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref>

The tomb of Archimedes had a carving of his favorite mathematical diagram, which was a [[sphere]] inside a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and diameter.  Archimedes had proved that the volume and surface area of the sphere would be two thirds that of the cylinder.  In 75 BC, 137 years after the death of Archimedes, the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[orator]] [[Cicero]] visited the tomb in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] which had become overgrown with scrub.  Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html | title = Tomb of Archimedes: Sources | publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html | title = Archimedes on Spheres and Cylinders | publisher = MathPages | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref>

==Discoveries and inventions==

Archimedes became a very popular figure as a result of his involvement in the defense of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] against the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[siege]] in the [[Second Punic War]]. He is reputed to have held the Romans at bay with war machines of his own design, to have been able to move a full-size ship complete with crew and cargo by pulling a single rope[http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/shipshaker2.html], and to have [[discovery (observation)|discover]]ed the principles of [[density]] and [[buoyancy]], also known as [[Archimedes's principle]], while taking a bath.  The story goes that a new crown in the shape of a [[Laurel_wreath|laurel wreath]] had been made for King Hiero, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether it was of solid [[gold]], or whether other metals had been added by a dishonest goldsmith.  Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down in order to measure its volume.  While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water rose as he got in.  He realised that this effect could be used to determine the [[volume]] of the crown, and therefore its [[density]] after weighing it.  The density of the crown would be lower if cheaper and lighter metals had been added.  He then took to the streets naked, being so elated with his discovery that he forgot to dress, crying "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ("I have found it!"). [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/pbuoy.html] [http://www.dctech.com/eureka/archimedes/crown/]  He has also been credited with the possible invention of the [[odometer]] during the [[First Punic War]]. One of his inventions used for military defense of Syracuse against the invading Romans was the [[claw of Archimedes]]. 
[[Image:DeathRayDiagram.gif|thumb|left|A diagram showing how Archimedes may have enabled the defenders of Syracuse to aim their mirrors at approaching ships]]
[[Image:Archimedes_Heat_Ray.gif|thumb|right|120px|A conceptual diagram of an Archimedes heat ray]]
It is said that he prevented one Roman attack on Syracuse by using a large array of [[mirror]]s (speculated to have been highly polished shields) to reflect sunlight onto the attacking ships causing them to catch fire.  This popular legend, dubbed the "Archimedes's death ray", has been tested many times since the Renaissance and often discredited as it seemed the ships would have had to have been virtually motionless and very close to shore for them to ignite, an unlikely scenario during a battle.  A group at the [[MIT]] have performed their own tests and concluded that the mirror weapon was a possibility 
[http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/lectures/10_ArchimedesResult.html].  A later test of their system done with the television show [[MythBusters]] proved to be inconclusive in conditions that more closely matched the described siege[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/10/22/state/n121443D54.DTL].  The only mitigating factor according to MIT was that the boat used for the test had recently been retrieved after being sunk, potentially making high moisture content an issue [http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/experiments/deathray/10_Mythbusters.html].  Additionally, MythBusters also took on the challenge of recreating the weapon and concluded that while it was possible to light a ship on fire, it would have to be stationary at a specified distance during the hottest part of a very bright, hot day, and would require several hundred troops carefully aiming mirrors while under attack. These unlikely conditions combined with the availability of other simpler methods, such as [[ballista]]e with flaming bolts, led the team to believe that the heat ray was far too impractical to be used, and probably just a myth.<ref>[http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode.html?clik=fanmain_leftnav Episode 55: Steam Cannon/Breakfast Cereal]</ref>  
Although the effect of the "Archimedes death ray" may have been limited to confusing or temporarily blinding an enemy, the weapon demonstrates knowledge of the [[parabolic reflector]], an advanced technical principle for its time. [http://www.falstad.com/ripple/ex-parabola.html]
[[Image:Archimedes' screw.jpg|thumb|The [[Archimedes screw]] lifts water to higher levels for irrigation.]]
Archimedes also has been credited with improving accuracy, range and power of the [[catapult]]. 

Perhaps his most used and practical invention still in use today is the [[Archimedes screw|Archimedes screw]]. It was used to drain ships and to transfer water from a low-lying body of water into irrigation canals, and is still in use today in many developing countries.

In creativity and insight, Archimedes exceeded any other European mathematician prior to the European [[Renaissance]]. In a civilization with an awkward numeral system and a language in which "a myriad" (literally "ten thousand") meant "infinity", he invented a positional numeral system and used it to write numbers up to 10<sup>64</sup>. He devised a [[heuristic]] method based on [[statistics]] to do private calculations that we would classify today as [[integral calculus]], but then presented rigorous [[geometry|geometric]] proofs for his results. To what extent he actually had a correct version of integral calculus is debatable. He proved that the [[ratio]] of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]] is the same as the ratio of the circle's area to the [[square (geometry)|square]] of the [[radius]]. He did not call this ratio [[Pi|π]], but he gave a procedure to approximate it to arbitrary accuracy and gave an approximation of it as between 3 + 10/71 (approximately 3.1408) and 3 + 1/7 (approximately 3.1429). He was the first [[ancient Greece|Greek]] mathematician to introduce [[mechanical curve]]s (those traced by a moving point) as legitimate objects of study. He proved that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is 4/3 the area of a [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]] with equal base and height.  (See the illustration below.  The "base" is any [[secant line]], not necessarily [[orthogonal]] to the parabola's [[Coordinate axis|axis]]; "the same base" means the same "horizontal" component of the length of the base; "horizontal" means orthogonal to the axis. "Height" means the length of the segment parallel to the axis from the [[vertex]] to the base. The vertex must be so placed that the two horizontal distances mentioned in the illustration are equal.)

<div style="float:right;padding:5px;text-align:center">[[Image:Parabola-and-inscribed_triangle.png]]<br></div>

In the process, he calculated the earliest known example of a [[geometric progression]] summed to infinity with the [[ratio]] 1/4:

:<math> \sum_{n=0}^\infty 4^{-n} = 1 + 4^{-1} + 4^{-2} + 4^{-3} + \cdots = {4\over 3} \; . </math>

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle in the [[illustration]] then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller secant lines in the illustration, and so on. Archimedes also gave a quite different proof of nearly the same [[proposition]] by a method using [[infinitesimals]] (see "[[Archimedes's use of infinitesimals]]").

He proved that the [[area]] and volume of the [[sphere]] are in the same ratio to the area and volume of a circumscribed straight [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], a result he was so proud of that he made it his [[epitaph]].

Archimedes is probably also the first [[mathematical physicist]] on record, and the best before [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He invented the field of [[statics]], enunciated the law of the [[lever]], the law of [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] of [[fluids]], and the law of [[buoyancy]]. He was the first to identify the concept of [[center of gravity]], and he found the centers of gravity of various geometric figures, assuming uniform [[density]] in their interiors, including [[triangles]], [[paraboloid]]s, and [[sphere|hemisphere]]s. Using only [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[geometry]], he also gave the equilibrium positions of floating sections of paraboloids as a function of their height, a feat that would be taxing to a modern physicist using [[calculus]]. 

Apart from general physics, he was also an [[astronomer]], and [[Cicero]] writes that the Roman [[consul]] [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]] brought two devices back to [[Rome]] from the ransacked city of Syracuse. One device mapped the [[sky]] on a sphere and the other predicted the motions of the [[sun]] and the [[moon]] and the [[planet]]s (i.e., an [[orrery]]). He credits [[Thales]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] for constructing these devices. For some time this was assumed to be a legend of doubtful nature, but the discovery of the [[Antikythera mechanism]] has changed the view of this issue, and it is indeed probable that Archimedes possessed and constructed such devices. [[Pappus]] of [[Alexandria]] writes that Archimedes had written a practical book on the construction of such spheres entitled ''[[On Sphere-Making]]''.

Archimedes's works were not widely recognized, even in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. He and his contemporaries probably constitute the peak of Greek [[mathematical rigour]]. During the [[Middle Ages]] the mathematicians who could understand Archimedes's work were few and far between. Many of his works were lost when the [[library of Alexandria]] was burnt (twice) and survived only in [[Latin]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[translation]]s. As a result, his ''[[how Archimedes used infinitesimals|mechanical method]]'' was lost until around [[1900]], after the [[arithmetization of analysis]] had been carried out successfully. We can only speculate about the effect that the "method" would have had on the development of [[calculus]] had it been known in the [[16th century|16th]] to the [[17th century|17th]] centuries.

==Writings by Archimedes==

* ''On the Equilibrium of Planes'' (2 volumes)
:This scroll explains the law of the lever and uses it to calculate the areas and centers of gravity of various geometric figures. 
* ''On Spirals''
:In this scroll, Archimedes defines what is now called [[Archimedes's spiral]]. This is the first mechanical curve (i.e., traced by a moving point) ever considered by a Greek mathematician. 
* ''On the Sphere and The Cylinder''
:In this scroll Archimedes obtains the result he was most proud of:  the relation between the area of a sphere to that of a circumscribed straight cylinder is the same as that of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder (exactly 2/3). 
* ''On Conoids and Spheroids''
:In this scroll Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of sections of cones, spheres, and paraboloids. 
* ''On Floating Bodies'' (2 volumes)
:In the first part of this scroll, Archimedes spells out the law of equilibrium of fluids, and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This was probably an attempt at explaining the observation made by Greek astronomers that the Earth is round. Note that his fluids are not self-gravitating: he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall and derives the spherical shape. One is led to wonder what he would have done had he struck upon the idea of [[universal gravitation]].
:In the second part, a veritable ''tour-de-force'', he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, which is reminiscent of the way [[iceberg]]s float, although Archimedes probably was not thinking of this application.
* ''The Quadrature of the Parabola''
:In this scroll, Archimedes calculates the area of a segment of a parabola (the figure delimited by a parabola and a secant line not necessarily perpendicular to the axis). The final answer is obtained by [[Triangulation|triangulating]] the area and summing the geometric series with ratio 1/4. 
* ''Stomachion''
:This is a Greek puzzle similar to a [[Tangram]]. In this scroll, Archimedes calculates the areas of the various pieces. This may be the first reference we have to this game. Recent discoveries indicate that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the strips of paper could be assembled into the shape of a square. This is possibly the first use of [[combinatorics]] to solve a problem.
* ''[[Archimedes' cattle problem]]''
:Archimedes wrote a letter to the scholars in the Library of Alexandria, who apparently had downplayed the importance of Archimedes's works. In these letters, he dares them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous [[Diophantine equation]]s, some of them [[quadratic equation|quadratic]] (in the more complicated version). This problem is one of the famous problems solved with the aid of a computer.  The solution is a very large number, approximately 7.760271{{e|206544}}
* ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''
:In this scroll, Archimedes counts the number of grains of sand fitting inside the [[universe]]. This book mentions [[Aristarchus of Samos]]' theory of the [[solar system]] (concluding that "this is impossible"), contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. From the introductory letter we also learn that Archimedes's father was an astronomer.
* ''"[[Archimedes Palimpsest|The Method]]"''
:In this work, which was unknown in the Middle Ages, but the importance of which was realised after its discovery, Archimedes pioneers the use of [[infinitesimal]]s, showing how breaking up a figure in an infinite number of infinitely small parts could be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes probably considered these methods not mathematically precise, and he used these methods to find at least some of the areas or volumes he sought, and then used the more traditional [[method of exhaustion]] to prove them. <!-- This particular work is found in what is called the [[Archimedes bathtub flotation device]]. --> Some details can be found at [[how Archimedes used infinitesimals]].
