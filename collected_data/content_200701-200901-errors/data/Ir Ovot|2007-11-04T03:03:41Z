'''Ir Ovot''' ({{lang-he|עיר אובות}}, ''City of [[Oboth]]'', also '''New Ein Hatzeva''') was an [[kibbutz|agricultural cooperative]] (kibbutz) in [[Israel]], located in the northeastern [[Negev]]'s [[Arabah]] region, and still refers to a small, unincorporated group of homes, mostly inhabited by a [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jewish]] group and members of the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] group "Blossoming Rose." Ir Ovot is also the site of an extensive archaeological complex known as '''Hatzeva Fortress''' (מצודת חצבה) which dates to the [[10th century BC|10th century BCE]]'s [[United Monarchy]]/[[First Temple]] period.

==Geography==
Ir Ovot is situated around {{coor dm|30|48|31.68|N|35|14|44.88|E|}} south of the [[Dead Sea]] and southeast of [[Dimona]] in the [[Arabah]] valley, an arid plain located below the [[Negev]] plateau and south of the [[Jordan Rift Valley]] within the larger [[Great Rift Valley]]. The settlement abuts the [[Ein Hatzeva]] bloc of agricultural villages on the opposite side of [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Highway 90]] near the [[Jordan]]ian border, and is within the boundaries of the [[Tamar Regional Council]], though it is no longer a recognised entity.<!--During the period of its governmentally recognised existence, its official population was eight, and it was the smallest community in Israel. pending source-->

==History==
Originally the site of the ''Ein Husub'' police station during the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], the location was captured by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in 1948. The village of Ir Ovot was founded in 1967, in an area deserted apart from a small military base and roadside cafe on the way to [[Eilat]]. It was founded by a group of American [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jews]] led by former [[law student]] and [[court clerk]] Simcha Pearlmutter, a Jew from [[Miami]], [[Florida]], who that year decided that [[Jesus]] was the Messiah, and took a Christian [[bigamy|second wife]] in addition to his Jewish one.<ref name=JPost>{{cite news| url=http://www.menorah.org.za/simcha_pearlmutter.php| title=Strange voice in the desert| author=Carl Schrag | publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=2007-09-24| date=[[April 21]], [[1990]]}}</ref><ref name=Haaretz>{{cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArtPE.jhtml?itemNo=290175&contrassID=2&subContrassID=18&sbSubContrassID=2| title=Arava community histories| author=Shiri Lev-Ari|accessdate=2007-09-24| publisher=[[Haaretz]]}} {{he icon}}</ref>
<!--Their religious beliefs including their support of bigamy led to antagonism with the Israeli authorities charged with settlement. It took them several years before the community won official recognition. Their supporters included the [[Israel Defense Forces]], which were interested in the establishment of a settlement in this strategic frontier area.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}-->[[Oboth]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Numbers|chapter=21|verse=10|nobook=}}; [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Deuteronomy|chapter=33|verse=44|nobook=}}) was [[Stations list|one of the camping stations]] used by the [[Israelite]]s during [[the Exodus|their Exodus]] from [[Egypt]].

The group was eventually joined by a few Jews and a number of [[gentile]]s who supported the self-styled [[Rabbi]] Pearlmutter. After disputes with the [[Jewish Agency]], Pearlmutter found a political and financial sponsor in the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidic group, despite Pearlmutter's adoption of Christianity. After establishing his alliance with Satmar, Pearlmutter declared himself to be an [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]]. Throughout the 1970s, Ir Ovot, which featured a [[cheder]], synagogue, communal [[dining room]], and members' meeting, was considered a [[Haredi]] [[kibbutz]], but a 1982 conflict between Pearlmutter and the [[Edah HaChareidis]] in Jerusalem led to the departure of his first, Jewish wife, and their children. His second wife remained even after his 2004 death. Officially dissolved as a formal association in the mid-1980s by two court-assigned liquidators, after further conflicts with local government over land leasing rights, the families remained in individual capacities. The village was joined by a German family in 2003, which has since become host for groups from [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] coming to take part in the agricultural work.<ref name=JPost/><ref name=Haaretz/>

Since 1984, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] "Blossoming Rose" has run a program for seasonal North American Christian volunteering in Ir Ovot's agriculture and operations. They were a driving force in financing and enlarging the archaeological dig, and have embarked on the development of the "Tamar" archaeological park at the site.

==Hatzeva Fortress==
First observed and documented by [[Alois Musil]] in 1902, the Roman fortress was identified on [[Fritz Frank]]'s 1932 travels in the region. In 1934, [[Nelson Glueck]] identified the location as a [[Nabataeans|Nabatæan]] [[caravanserai]] coopted by the Romans, but the site's true significance was noted by [[Benjamin Mazar]] and [[Michael Avi-Yonah]]'s 1950 discovery of [[sherd]]s from the [[First Temple]] period. In the 1960s, it was first suggested by [[Yohanan Aharoni]] that the site might be the same as [[Tamar (Bible)|Tamar]] of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Ezekiel|chapter=47|verse=19|nobook=}} and {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Ezekiel|chapter=48|verse=28|nobook=}}, and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''Tamara''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blossomingrose.org/restore/tamar/2006-12-31%20news.htm| title=Tamar site's history| publisher=[[Blossoming Rose]]}}</ref>

The first salvage [[excavation]] took place in 1972 under Aharoni and [[Rudolph Cohen]]'s direction, but much of the work was carried out by Cohen, [[Yigal Yisrael]], and recently [[Tali Erickson-Gini]], following the 1986 involvement of "Blossoming Rose" in partnership with the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]], [[Jewish National Fund]] and [[Tamar Regional Council]]. Known in addition to Tamar as the Hatzeva Fortress, or alternatively identified with Solomon's [[Palmyra|Tadmor]], the site has six [[Stratification (archeology)|strata]] which indicate Early [[Israelite]], Nabatæan, [[Edom|Edomite]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], and Early [[Arab]] occupations. It includes a 1,000 year old [[shade tree]], and the largest ''[[Paliurus spina-christi]]'' in Israel.<ref name=Haaretz/><ref name=Tamar>{{cite web| url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/excavations/Biblical_Tamar_Park.htm| title=Excavation at Biblical Tamar Park| author=Matt VandeBunte |publisher=The Boble and Interpretation |accessdate=2007-09-24|date=[[March 2004]]}}</ref>

The area was used for training crews in site conservation before their work on the [[Masada]] site.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.siteconservation.com/en_Conservationprojectsbyregion.htm| title=Conservation projects by region|accessdate=2007-09-24| publisher=Archaeology Conservation Center}}</ref>

===10th century BCE===
The earliest remains, dating to the [[United Monarchy|Solomonic]] period of the [[10th century BC|10th century BCE]], resembles other contemporary Negev plateau fortresses and included period "Negbite" style earthenware. Ranging from tenth to sixth centuries BCE, Negbite was also uncovered at Tel [[Kadesh Barnea]] and [[Etzion Gever|Tel el-Kheleifeh]]; it is probable that this level was  destroyed by Pharaoh [[Shishaq]] like other sites of that period.<ref name=Tamar/>

===9th–8th century BCE===
The second layer consists of a very large [[Iron Age]] fortification surrounded by a [[casemate]] wall. This [[First Temple]] period building of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] is almost as large as contemporary cities such as [[Tel Be'er Sheva]], and is four times larger than other fortified [[Negev cities]] at 10,000 [[square metre]]s.<ref name=Tamar/>

Excavation revealed a four-chambered, north-facing gate complex near the northeastern corner and three storerooms, a pair of [[granaries]], a [[moat]] and a [[defensive wall]]. The city was possibly constructed by King [[Amaziah of Judah]], an [[8th century BCE]] ruler who fortified the Judean kingdom and went to war with neighbouring Edom in the northern [[Arabah]], or his son [[Uzziah]] whose construction of towers in the desert is mentioned by the second [[Book of Chronicles]].<ref name=Tamar/>

[[Image:IrOvot3.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the [[caldarium]] from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[thermae|thermæ]]. The heat would flow in the empty space below the floor, which was held up by the short pillars.]]

===7th–6th century BCE===
A third fortress from the Late First Temple period from the 7th–6th centuries BCE was found, though because only the walls' foundations remain, reconstructing the floor plan has been difficult. However, an eastern wall with two towers set {{convert|14|m|ft|0}} apart was reconstructed.<ref name=Tamar/>

A pit full of smashed clay and stone, which were reassembled into 74 [[cultic]] vessels, was also found, indicating a probable Edomite shrine. [[Censer]]s, [[chalice (cup)|chalice]]s, [[altar]]s and human [[figurine]]s were unearthed outside the fortress wall on the site's northern edge in 1993, near the foundations of a small building that seems to have been a shrine. Some of the [[sherd]]s resemble vessels found in an Edomite shrine at [[Horvat Qitmit]], about {{convert|45|km|mi|0}} to the northwest. A circular stone [[stamp seal]] discovered inside the fortress, picturing two men in long robes on either side of an altar, provides another indicator of Edomite origin. The pit recoveries dating to the end of the seventh century could possibly have been destroyed in the campaign of religious reforms spearheaded by King [[Josiah]] mentioned in [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings II]].<ref name=Tamar/>

===1st–4th century CE===
Evidence of Roman administrative and military presence is plentiful, and the junction of the east–west [[Incense Road]] to [[Gaza]] and the north–south route to the [[Red Sea]] probably made it an economically valuable frontier outpost.<ref name=Tamar/>

The Roman Fortress' layout is similar to other imperial outposts in the region. An official Latin inscription that dates several area strongholds to the [[3rd century|3rd century CE]] was discovered on a large limestone slab at nearby [[Yotvata]] bears. This site was the largest in the area at {{convert|46|sqm|sqft|0}}, and included four projecting towers on the fortress' corners. Artefacts tell of probably destruction in the middle of the fourth century CE, perhaps by a [[344]] earthquake, though it was promptly rebuilt with improved, stone flooring and again destroyed two decades later, probably from an earthquake in [[363]].<ref name=Tamar/>

A [[thermae|thermæ]] and [[caravanserai]] of the same period were also found, and is similar to the thermæ at [[Ashkelon]] and others in the nearby country.<ref name=Tamar/> A row of rooms from an earlier, [[1st century BC|1st century BCE]] to [[1st century|1st century CE]] fortress revealed artefacts pointing to a [[Nabataean|Nabatæan]] occupation predating Roman annexation. Coins bearing the likeness of Nabatæan kings were found, along with storage jars and other vessels.<ref name=Tamar/>

===7th–8th century CE===
A building fragment [[Stratification (archeology)|stratum]] from the Early Arab period was uncovered immediately beneath the ground surface, along with evidence of a farm located above the Roman thermæ's remains and below the modern structures.<ref name=Tamar/>
