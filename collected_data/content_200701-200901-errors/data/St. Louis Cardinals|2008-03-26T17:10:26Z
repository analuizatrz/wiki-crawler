{{For|the National Football League team that played in St. Louis from 1960 to 1987|Arizona Cardinals}}

The '''St. Louis Cardinals''' (also referred to as "the '''Cards'''" or "the '''Redbirds'''") are a professional [[baseball]] team based in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. They are members of the [[National League Central|Central Division]] in the [[National League]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. The Cardinals have won a [[National League]] record 10 [[World Series]] championships, second only to the [[New York Yankees]] in Major League Baseball who have 26.

The Cardinals were founded in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in 1882 as the St. Louis Brown Stockings, taking the name from [[St. Louis Brown Stockings|an earlier National League team]].  They joined the National League in 1892 and have been known as the Cardinals since 1900.  The Cardinals began play in the current [[Busch Stadium]] in 2006, becoming the first team since 1923 to win the World Series in their first season in a new ballpark.  The Cardinals have a [[Cardinals-Cubs rivalry|strong rivalry]] with the [[Chicago Cubs]] that began in 1885.

==History==
{{main|History of the St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals seasons}}
===1880s-1930s===
The Cardinals were founded in [[1882 in baseball|1882]] as a member of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] called the St. Louis Brown Stockings, later shortened to the Browns.  The club quickly achieved success, winning four AA pennants in a row, 1885-1888.  Following these titles St. Louis played in an early version of the [[World_Series#Champions_prior_to_and_precursors_to_the_modern_World_Series_.281857-1902.29|World Series]], the first two times against the [[National League]]'s Chicago White Stockings (now the [[Chicago Cubs]]).  The 1885 series ended in dispute, but St. Louis won the 1886 series outright, beginning a [[Cardinals-Cubs rivalry|St. Louis-Chicago rivalry]] that continues today.<ref> Jon David Cash, ''Before They Were Cardinals: Major League Baseball in Nineteenth-Century St. Louis.'' University of Missouri Press 2002</ref> The American Association went bankrupt in [[1892 in baseball|1892]] and the Browns moved to the National League, leaving much of their success behind for the next three decades.  The club changed its name to the Perfectos in [[1899 in baseball|1899]] before adopting the Cardinals name in [[1900 in baseball|1900]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline1.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 1 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=6 March | accessyear=2007}}</ref>
[[Image:Rogers Hornsby.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Rogers Hornsby]] won two Triple Crowns with the Cardinals.]]
The Cardinals' fortunes in the National League began to improve in [[1920 in baseball|1920]] when [[Sam Breadon]] bought the club and made [[Branch Rickey]] [[General_manager#Sports_teams|general manager]].  Rickey immediately moved the Cardinals to [[Sportsman's Park]] to become tenants of their [[American League]] rivals, the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]], and sold the Cardinals' [[Robison Field|ballpark]].  Rickey used the money from the sale to invest in and pioneer the [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] [[Farm team|farm system]] with the Cardinals, which would produce many great players and lead to new success for the Cardinals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline2.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 2 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=6 March | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Led by [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Rogers Hornsby]], who won the [[Triple crown (baseball)|triple crown]] in [[1922 in baseball|1922]] and [[1925 in baseball|1925]], the Cardinals improved drastically during the 1920s.  They won their first National League pennant in [[1926 in baseball|1926]], and then defeated the favored [[New York Yankees]] in seven games to win the [[1926 World Series|World Series]].  The Cardinals, now led by [[Frankie Frisch]], fell just short in [[1927 in baseball|1927]] before claiming another pennant in [[1928 in baseball|1928]].  However, the Yankees avenged their 1926 loss by sweeping the Cardinals in four games in the [[1928 World Series|World Series]].  The Cardinals, though, kept winning in the new decade, claiming back-to-back pennants in [[1930 in baseball|1930]] and [[1931 in baseball|1931]].  The Cardinals matched up with the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] in both World Series, losing in [[1930 World Series|1930]] but returning to win the [[1931 World Series|1931 series]].  In [[1934 in baseball|1934]] the team, nicknamed the [[Gashouse Gang]] for their shabby appearance and rough tactics, again won the pennant and then the [[1934 World Series|World Series]] over the [[Detroit Tigers]].  [[Dizzy Dean]] won 30 games that season, the last National League pitcher to reach that mark.  [[Joe Medwick]] won the [[Triple crown (baseball)|triple crown]] in [[1937 in baseball|1937]], the last National League hitter achieve the feat, but the Cardinals failed to win another pennant until the end of the decade.<ref name="Timeline3">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline3.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 3 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=7 May | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===1940s-1970s===
Outfielder [[Stan Musial|Stan "The Man" Musial]] joined the Cardinals in 1941. Known to loyal fans as "Ol' Number 6", Musial spent 22 years in a Cardinals uniform and won three [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|NL MVP Awards]]. In 1968, a statue of Musial was constructed outside Busch Stadium to honor his career.  During [[World War II]] the Cardinals dominated the National League, winning three straight pennants from 1942-1944.  The [[1942 in baseball|1942]] "St. Louis Swifties" won a franchise record 106 games and defeated the Yankees in the [[1942 World Series|World Series]].  The team posted the second best records in team history with 105 wins in both [[1943 in baseball|1943]] and [[1944 in baseball|1944]].  The Cardinals fell to the Yankees in the [[1943 World Series]] in a rematch of the previous year.  The [[1944 World Series]] was particularly memorable as the Cardinals met their crosstown rivals, the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]], in the "[[Tram|Streetcar]] Series" with the Cardinals prevailing for their fifth title.  In [[1946 in baseball|1946]] the Cardinals finished the season tied with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], but claimed the pennant in a three-game playoff series.  The Cardinals then won the [[1946 World Series|World Series]] in seven games against the [[Boston Red Sox]].  In the bottom of the eighth inning in game seven with the score tied at 3-3, [[Enos Slaughter]] scored on a "[[Slaughter's Mad Dash|Mad Dash]]" from first on a double to left-center to win the game and the series.<ref name="Timeline3"> </ref>

Rickey left the Cardinals to become general manager of the Dodgers in 1942, and after their 1946 win the Cardinals slid back to the middle of the National League for the next two decades.  In [[1953 in baseball|1953]] the [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewery bought the Cardinals and [[Gussie Busch|August "Gussie" Busch]] became team president.  He soon purchased Sportman's Park from St. Louis Browns owner [[Bill Veeck]] and renovated and renamed the ballpark [[Sportsman's Park|Busch Stadium]].  The Browns, who had not been as successful or popular as the Cardinals in three decades, realized they could not compete with the deep pockets of the brewery.  After the 1953 season, the Browns left St. Louis to become the [[Baltimore Orioles]], and the Cardinals were left as the only major league team in town.<ref name="Timeline4">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline4.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 4 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=15 May | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The Cardinals achieved another period of success in the 1960s with the help of a trade and a dominating pitcher.  In [[1964 in baseball|1964]] the Cardinals traded pitcher [[Ernie Broglio]] and two other players to the rival Cubs for outfielder [[Lou Brock]] and two other players.  The trade, since nicknamed [[Brock for Broglio]], has become definitive of a trade which in retrospect is ridiculously lopsided.  The Cardinals would prove to be on the good side of the trade as Brock would replace Musial, who had retired at the end of 1963, in leftfield and become a Hall of Famer.  Behind Brock and pitcher [[Bob Gibson]], who won 20 games for the first time, the Cardinals won the [[1964 World Series]] over the Yankees.  In [[1966 in baseball|1966]] the Cardinals moved to the new [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] and hosted the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] that summer.  The next year the team reached and won the [[1967 World Series]] over the Red Sox.  Gibson pitched three complete game wins, allowing only three earned runs, and was named [[World Series MVP Award|World Series MVP]] for the second time (he was also MVP in 1964).  In [[1968 in baseball|1968]], nicknamed the "Year of the Pitcher" for the domination of pitching over hitting throughout the majors, the Cardinals' [[Bob Gibson]] proved to be the most dominant pitcher of all.  Gibson's [[earned run average]] of 1.12 is a [[live-ball era]] record and he won both the NL [[Cy Young Award]] and [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|NL MVP Award]].  Behind Gibson's season the Cardinals reached the [[1968 World Series]] against the Detroit Tigers.  Gibson would pitch another three complete games and set the a World Series record with 35 strikeouts, including a single game record 17 in Game 1.  However, a key error by Cardinals outfielder [[Curt Flood]] in Game 7 allowed the Tigers to win the series.  Gibson would win a second Cy Young Award in 1970, but the Cardinals would fail to win a pennant during the next decade.<ref name="Timeline4"> </ref>

===1980s-present===
The Cardinals returned to their winning ways in [[1981 in baseball|1981]], however a rule change because of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened season]] left the Cardinals out of the playoffs.  Despite having the best overall record in the NL East, the Cardinals finished in second in both halves of the strike-split season.  But just like in 1964, a trade would propel the Cardinals upward.  Before the [[1982 in baseball|1982]] season began the Cardinals acquired shortstop [[Ozzie Smith]] from the [[San Diego Padres]] via a trade.  With Smith, and playing a form of baseball nicknamed [[Whiteyball]] after manager [[Whitey Herzog]], the Cardinals won the [[1982 World Series]] over the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].  Whitey's Cardinals return to the [[1985 World Series]] against the [[Kansas City Royals]].  The series was nicknamed the "I-70 Series" after the highway that connects the in-state rivals.  The Royals won in seven games, but the series in most remembered for a blown call by umpire [[Don Denkinger]] in Game 6 that turned the tide of the series for the Royals.  The Cardinals would also reach the [[1987 World Series]], losing to the [[Minnesota Twins]].<ref name="Timeline5">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline5.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 5 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=14 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref>
[[Image:mark mcgwire.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Mark McGwire]] broke the single-season home run record while playing with St. Louis in 1998.]]  
The Cardinals hit another period of little success in the early 1990s.  That changed in [[1996 in baseball|1996]] when the Cardinals hired [[Tony La Russa]] away from the [[Oakland Athletics]].  The team won the NL Central that season and defeated the Padres in the [[National League Division Series|NLDS]] before falling to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]].  In [[1998 in baseball|1998]] the Cardinals were the focus of the baseball world as slugging first baseman [[Mark McGwire]] broke the single season home run record by hitting 70 home runs.  McGwire's epic pursuit of the record along with the Cubs' [[Sammy Sosa]] helped to re-popularize baseball after the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|1994 strike]].<ref name="Timeline5"> </ref>

The start of the new millennium coincided with a new era of success for the Cardinals as the team, led primarily by [[Albert Pujols]], won the NL Central in six of seven years.  The Cardinals would fall short in the post-season in [[2000 in baseball|2000]], [[2001 in baseball|2001]], and [[2002 in baseball|2002]] before missing the playoffs altogether in [[2003 in baseball|2003]].  However, in [[2004 in baseball|2004]] the Cardinals won 105 games for the best record in baseball.  They then defeated the Dodgers in the [[2004 National League Division Series|NLDS]] and the [[Houston Astros]] in an epic seven game [[2004 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] to reach the [[2004 World Series]].  But the Cardinals were swept by the Boston Red Sox, who won their first World Series in 86 years.  The Cardinals won 100 games and another Central Division title in [[2005 in baseball|2005]], but lost in an [[2005 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] rematch to the Astros.  The Cardinals moved to the new [[Busch Stadium]] in [[2006 in baseball|2006]] and finally overcame the playoffs.  The team struggled during the season, winning only 83 games.  However that was enough to win a very weak Central division.  In the playoffs the Cardinals caught fire and defeated the [[San Diego Padres]] in the [[2006 National League Division Series|NLDS]], and then the [[New York Mets]] in another incredible seven game [[2006 National League Championship Series|NLCS]].  In the [[2006 World Series]] the Cardinals faced the heavily-favored Detroit Tigers, but won in five games for the franchise's tenth World Series title.<ref name="Timeline6">{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/history/timeline6.jsp | title=Cardinals timeline 6 | work=St. Louis Cardinals Official Website | accessdate=14 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

The 2000's also brought an incredible amount of tragedy to the Cardinals as several deaths struck the franchise.  On [[June 18]], [[2002]] long-time Cardinals radio broadcaster [[Jack Buck]] passed away at the age of 77.  Just four days later, and much more shockingly, Cardinals starting pitcher [[Darryl Kile]] died the night before a game in Chicago against the Cubs.  Kile was only 33 years old when he suffered heart failure in his sleep.  Five years later, on [[April 29]], [[2007]], Cardinals relief pitcher [[Josh Hancock]], age 29, was killed in a car accident while driving drunk when his vehicle collided with a stopped tow truck that was aiding a disabled motorist.<ref name="Hancock">{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2860122 | title=ESPN article on Josh Hancock's death | work=ESPN.com Website | accessdate=14 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

[[Jackie Robinson]]'s number 42 was retired throughout baseball in [[1997 in baseball|1997]].  The Cardinals 'retired' the number 42 a second time in Sept. [[2006 in baseball|2006]] as [[Bruce Sutter]] had been elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] earlier in the year.

Cardinal stockholders honored Busch with the number 85 on his 85th birthday, in [[1984]]. Also, while not officially retired, the number 25 of [[Mark McGwire]] (1B, 1997-2001) has not been reissued since he retired, the number 51 of [[Willie McGee]] (OF 1982-1990, 1996-1999) has not been reissued since late in the 2001 season, and the number 57 of [[Darryl Kile]] (P, 2000-02) has not been reissued since his death in the middle of the [[2002 in baseball|2002]] season. (Kile is honored with a small circular logo bearing his initials and number on the wall of the Cardinal bullpen, as is deceased pitcher [[Josh Hancock]].)  The team also honored longtime radio commentator [[Jack Buck]] by placing a drawing of a microphone on the wall with the retired numbers.

The Cardinals are tied with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] as having retired the second-most numbers in baseball with 10, behind only the [[New York Yankees]]' 16.

==Radio and television==
{{see also|List of St. Louis Cardinals broadcasters}}
In St. Louis, Cardinals games on radio can be heard over [[KTRS (AM)|KTRS]], a [[talk radio]] station of which the team owns 50 percent.  [[Mike Shannon]] and [[John Rooney]] alternate as [[play-by-play]] announcers.  KTRS feeds the games to a network comprised of 115 stations, covering Missouri, [[Illinois]], [[Arkansas]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Tennessee]].

Prior to moving to KTRS in 2006, the Cardinals and [[KMOX]] radio enjoyed a partnership that spanned over seven decades.  But the relationship ended after the 2005 season when [[CBS Radio]], KMOX's parent company, and the Cardinals failed to reach terms on a new rights agreement, resulting in the team leaving the 50,000-watt [[clear channel]] behemoth in favor of becoming part-owners of 5,000-watt KTRS. 

On television, coverage is split between [[Fox Sports Net|Fox Sports Net Midwest]] and [[KSDK]], St. Louis' [[NBC]] affiliate.  KSDK replaced [[KPLR-TV]] as the Cards' over-the-air television broadcaster starting in the 2007 season.  KSDK and its predecessor, KSD-TV, previously carried the team from 1963 until 1987.

[[Joe Buck]] and [[Al Hrabosky]] are the official announcers on FSN Midwest, though Buck's [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] commitments restrict him to only doing ten games per season; [[Dan McLaughlin]] and [[Rick Horton]] fill in when Joe Buck is unavailable.  Buck's father was Cardinals legend and Hall of Fame announcer [[Jack Buck]].  [[Jay Randolph]] and Horton team up for KSDK contests. All telecasts on KSDK will be in [[High-definition television|HDTV]], along with a select number on FSN Midwest.
