'''''Love. Angel. Music. Baby.''''' is the debut solo album by [[United States|America]]n [[pop rock]] singer [[Gwen Stefani]], released by [[Interscope Records]] in November 2004 (see [[2004 in music]]).  The album originally began as a small side project, but grew into a large production with numerous collaborations and producers. It was designed as a modern version of [[Timeline of trends in music (1980-1989)|1980s music]], with the majority of its lyrics focusing on fashion and wealth.

Upon release, the album received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics.  It had high sales, going multi-platinum in several countries and selling seven million copies.  The album also brought Stefani several [[Grammy Award]] nominations in 2005 and 2006.

==Conception and writing==
During Stefani's time with [[No Doubt]], she began appearing on songs with artists including [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Moby]], and the [[Brian Setzer Orchestra]]; the band also worked with artists including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[The Neptunes]], and [[Dr. Dre]] during the production of ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001).  While the band was on tour to promote the album, Stefani listened to [[Club Nouveau]]'s "[[Why You Treat Me So Bad]]" and considered recording new material that modernized [[1980s music]].<ref name="scared">Vineyard, Jennifer.

In early 2003, Stefani began recording solo material, unsure of the project's direction.<ref name="recording">Moss, Corey and Downey, Ryan.

Retrieved [[February 25]], [[2007]].</ref>  She showed interest in creating singles to be used on soundtracks, later playing [[Jean Harlow]] in ''[[The Aviator]]'', but also considered continuing her series of collaborations or making a full solo album.<ref name="recording"/>  During her first sessions, with [[Linda Perry]], Stefani's combination of [[writer's block]] and self-consciousness resulted in an unfruitful attempt.<ref name="scared"/>  During the second day, the two wrote a song about Stefani's writer's block, which went on to become "[[What You Waiting For?]]", the lead single.<ref name="scared"/>

When the two began working on a song that Stefani felt was too personal, she left to visit her former boyfriend and fellow band member [[Tony Kanal]], who played her a track on which he had been working, which later became "[[Crash (song)|Crash]]", another single from the album.<ref name="scared"/>  The two tried to work on new material but gave up after two weeks and did not return to work until six months later, when Stefani decided that she was comfortable collaborating with other artists, commenting, "If I were to write the chorus of '[[Yesterday (song)|Yesterday]]' by [[the Beatles]], and that's all I wrote, that would be good enough to be part of that history."<ref name="scared"/>  Stefani returned to work with Linda Perry, who invited [[Dallas Austin]], and many other artists, including [[Outkast]]'s [[André 3000]], The Neptunes, and Dr. Dre.<ref name="scared"/>  More than a year after starting on the album, Stefani announced in 2004 that she would be releasing what she referred to as "my dance record" later that year.<ref>Orshoski, Wes.

==Lyrical content==
The album's lyrical content primarily discusses what [[All Music Guide]] called "fleeting style and outdated [[bling-bling]] culture", with songs such as "[[Rich Girl (Gwen Stefani song)|Rich Girl]]" and "[[Luxurious (song)|Luxurious]]" featuring descriptions of riches and wealth.<ref name="AMG">[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]].

[[Image:HarajukuLoversTour.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Stefani performing with the Harajuku Girls on the Harajuku Lovers Tour.]]

''Love. Angel. Music. Baby.'' also introduced the [[Harajuku Girls]], an entourage of four [[Japan]]ese women.  The Harajuku Girls are frequently mentioned in the album, with the song "Harajuku Girls" entirely dedicated to them.  They have since appeared in most of the music videos produced for the album and those for Stefani's second album ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006).  In October 2005, [[Korean American]] actor and comedian [[Margaret Cho]] wrote an article largely critical of the group.<ref name="cho">[[Margaret Cho|Cho, Margaret]].  [http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/harajukugirls.htm "Harajuku Girls"].  [[October 31]], [[2005]].</ref>  In the article, Cho referred to the group as a "[[minstrel show]]" and compared the act to the [[blackface]] tradition, stating, "I am just in acceptance over it, because something is better than nothing."<ref name="cho"/>  ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' magazine also criticized the practice, stating that Stefani had "swallowed a subversive [[youth culture]] in Japan and barfed up another image of submissive giggling Asian women."<ref>[[Mihi Ahn|Ahn, MiHi]].

==Critical reception==
The album received mixed reviews, with many noting the large number of collaborations and producers.

Many reviewers also focused on the album's light lyrical themes.  ''Entertainment Weekly'' called the references to Stefani's clothing line "shameless" and stated that "each song becomes akin to a pricey retro fashion blurb",<ref name="EW"/> and Pitchfork Media said that "the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s free-money parade through [[Gotham City]] was a much more entertaining display of wealth, and he had [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], not just [[Wendy & Lisa]]."<ref name="pitchfork"/> ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' magazine stated that the album's "fashion fetish...gives the album a sense of thematic cohesiveness" but that the "obsession with Harajuku girls borders on maniacal".<ref name="slant"/>  ''The Guardian'' disagreed with this perspective, arguing that "her affinity with [[Culture of Japan#Popular culture|Japanese pop culture]]...yields a synthetic sheen...that works well with the other point of reference, [[hip hop music|hip-hop]]."<ref name="guardian"/>
