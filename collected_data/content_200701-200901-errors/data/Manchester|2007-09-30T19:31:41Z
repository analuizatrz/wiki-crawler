{{main|History of Manchester}}
===Toponymy===
The name "Manchester" ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|/ˈmæntʃɛstə/}}) came from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name ''Mamucium'', thought to be a [[Latin]]isation of an original [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name (possibly meaning "breast-like hill" from ''mamm-'' = "breast"), plus [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''ceaster'' = "town", which is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[castra]]'' = "camp".<ref name="Place names">{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_Titles__2B_05|last=Mills|first=A.D.|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198527586}}</ref>

There are few signs of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] occupation of the city. The only major [[Bronze age#Great Britain|Bronze age]] finds have been to south of the city, where the remains of an extensive farming community were discovered during the construction of [[Manchester Airport]]'s second runway.<ref name="Hartwell">{{cite book|title=Pevsner Architectural Guides: Manchester|last=Hartwell|first=Clare|date=2001|pages= 11–17, 155, 256, 267–268|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London, England|isbn=0140711317}}</ref>

Central Manchester has been settled since at least [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times.<ref name="Roman">{{cite book | title=Halloween: from Pagan Ritual to Party Night| url=http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780195168969| last=Rogers| first=Nicholas| date=2003| pages=18| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| isbn=0195168968}}</ref> The Roman general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] constructed a fort called [[Mamucium]] in the 70s [[AD]] on a defensible hill where the [[River Medlock]] meets the [[River Irwell]], at the junction of roads to [[Deva Victrix|Chester]], [[Eboracum|York]], [[Buxton]], [[Ribchester]], and [[Melandra]]. A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the fort is visible in [[Castlefield]]. The Romans withdrew in the early fifth century, and by the time of the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066 the focus of settlement had shifted to the confluence of the rivers [[River Irwell|Irwell]] and [[River Irk|Irk]].<ref name="Kidd">{{cite book|title=Manchester: A History|url=http://www.carnegiepublishing.com/product/view/46|last=Kidd|first=Alan|date=2006|pages= 12, 15–24|publisher=Carnegie Publishing Ltd|location=Lancaster, Lancashire|isbn=1859361285}}</ref> Much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent [[Harrying of the North]].<ref name="Hylton">{{cite book|title=A History of Manchester|url=http://www.phillimore.co.uk/acatalog/info_1860772404.html|last=Hylton|first=Stuart|date=2003|pages=Pg. 1–10, 22, 25, 42, 63–67, 69|publisher=Phillimore & Co Ltd|isbn=1860772404}}</ref><ref name="Arrowsmith">{{cite book|title=Stockport: a History|last=Arrowsmith|first=Peter|date=1997|pages=Pg. 30|publisher=Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council|id=0905164997}}</ref>

Thomas de la Warre, lord of the manor, founded and constructed a collegiate church for the [[Manchester (ancient parish)|parish]] in 1421. The church is now [[Manchester Cathedral]]; the domestic premises of the college now house [[Chetham's School of Music]] and [[Chetham's Library]].<ref name="Hartwell"/><ref name="Kidd"/>

Around the 14th century, Manchester received an influx of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers, sometimes credited as the foundation of the region's textile industry.<ref name="Flemish">{{cite book | title=Lancashire, The Industrial and Commercial South| last=Pevsner| first=Nikolaus| date=1969| pages=Pg. 265| publisher=Penguin Books Ltd| location=London, England| id=0140710361}}</ref> Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen, and by about 1540, had expanded to become, in [[John Leland]]'s words, "The fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire."<ref name="Kidd"/> The cathedral and Chetham's buildings are the only significant survivors of Leland's Manchester.<ref name="Hylton"/>

Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton [[fustian]]s, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance.<ref name="Kidd"/> The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The [[Bridgewater Canal]], Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at [[Worsley]] to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton.<ref name="Kidd"/><ref name="Hartwell"/> Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns.<ref name="Kidd"/> A [[commodities exchange]], opened in 1729,<ref name="Hylton"/> and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce.

In 1780, [[Richard Arkwright]] began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill.<ref name="Hartwell"/><ref name="Hylton"/>

===Industrial Revolution===
[[Image:Manchester central 1894.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A map of Manchester from 1894]][[Image:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Manchester (or [[Cottonopolis]] as it was sometimes referred) during the early 19th century]]

The cotton industry was at the forefront of the industrial revolution in England. The great majority of cotton processing took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods.<ref name="Kidd"/><ref name=Hall>{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Peter | title = Cities in Civilization | publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-297-84219-6 | chapter = The first industrial city: Manchester 1760-1830}}</ref>  The area was dubbed "[[Cottonopolis]]" in its honour.

Manchester developed a wide range of industries, so that by 1835 "Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world."<ref name=Hall/>  Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, but diversified into general manufacture.  Similarly, the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes, but expanded into other areas.  Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance.  Trade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the world's first intercity passenger railway—the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down.<ref name="Kidd"/>  In 1878 the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] (the forerunner of [[BT Group|British Telecom]]) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.<ref name="GPO">{{Cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/1851to1880/1878.htm|title=Events in Telecommunications History|accessdate=2007-07-30|publisher=BT Archives|year=1878}}</ref>

At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the [[Manchester School]], promoting [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: "What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow."<ref name="manchester innovation">{{cite book|editor=Speake, Jennifer|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t90.e1326|accessdate=2007-07-06|year=2003|edition=4th Edition|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198605242|quote=What Manchester says today, the rest of England says tomorrow}}<br />• {{Cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=135381 |title=Our vision to make Manchester the creative capital of Europe|accessdate=2007-07-06|publisher=[[Conservative Party (UK)]]|year=2007}}<br />• {{Cite web|url=http://www.mmu.ac.uk/studyatmmu/manchesterlife/|title=Manchester Life|accessdate=2007-07-06|publisher=[[Manchester Metropolitan University]]|year=2007}}</ref>  As well as being a centre of capitalism the city saw its fair share of rebellion by the working and non-titled classes, with the most famous being the events on St Peter’s Field on [[16 August]] [[1819]] which have become known as [[Peterloo]]. The first [[Trades Union Congress]] was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was the subject of [[Friedrich Engels]]'s ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', Engels himself spending much of his life in and around Manchester.<ref name="Engles">{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm|title=Marx-Engels Internet Archive - Biography of Engels|accessdate=2007-07-30|publisher=Marx/Engels Biography Archive|year=1893}}</ref> Manchester was also an important cradle of the [[Labour Party (UK)| Labour Party]] and the [[Suffragette]] Movement.<ref name="">{{cite book|title=Manchester: A History|url=http://www.carnegiepublishing.com/product/view/46|last=Kidd|first=Alan|date=2006|pages=Chapter 9 "England Arise!

Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including the Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. In 1889, when county councils were created in [[England]], the municipal borough became a [[county borough]] with even greater autonomy. During this period, the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was created by the canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey for {{convert|36|mi|km|0}} from Salford to the Mersey estuary. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canal's banks, just outside the borough, the world's first industrial estate was created at [[Trafford Park]].<ref name="Kidd"/><!--1993, p103 -->  Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.

<!-- this para belongs later -->By 1963 the port was the UK's third largest,<ref name="UK's 3rd largest">{{cite book|title=Manchester: an Architectural History|url=http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/catalogue/book.asp?id=1423|last=Parkinson-Bailey|first=John J|date=2000|pages=Pg. 127|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719056063}}<br />• {{cite book|title=Lancashire, The Industrial and Commercial South|last=Pevsner| first=Nikolaus|date=1969|pages=Pg. 267|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|location=London, England|isbn=0140710361}}</ref> and employed over 3,000 men, but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large [[Containerization|container]] ships. Traffic declined, and the port closed in 1982.<ref name="ship close">{{Cite web|url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/living/regeneration/geographicareas/quays-regen/salford-quays/manchesterdocks.htm|title=Manchester Ship Canal and The Docks|accessdate=2007-07-06|publisher=Salford City Council|year=2005}}</ref>

In 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area,<ref name="Kidd"/> but the First World War interrupted access to the export markets.  Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester.  Manchester suffered greatly from the inter-war depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

===World War II===
Like most of the UK, the Manchester area mobilised extensively during [[World War II]].  For example, casting and machining expertise at [[Beyer-Peacock]]'s locomotive works in [[Gorton]] was switched to bomb making; [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]]'s rubber works in [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]] made [[barrage balloon]]s; and just outside the city in [[Trafford Park]], engineers [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] made aircraft and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the [[Luftwaffe]], and by the middle of 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets. The biggest took place during the "[[Manchester Blitz|Christmas Blitz]]" on the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940, when an estimated 467 [[long ton|ton]]s (475 tonnes) of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses damaged.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hardy | first = Clive | title = Manchester at War | edition = (2nd edition) | date = 2005 | publisher = First Edition <!-- sic --> | location =  | isbn = 1-84547-096-6 | pages = pg.&nbsp;75–99 | chapter = The blitz }}</ref>  [[Manchester Cathedral]] was among the buildings seriously damaged; its restoration took 20 years.<ref name="WWII">{{Cite web|url=http://www.manchestercathedralonline.co.uk/timeline2.html|title=Manchester Cathedral - Historical Timeline|accessdate=2007-09-11|publisher=Manchester Cathedral Online|year=2004}}</ref>

Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans, including the [[Manchester Martyrs]] of 1867, arson in 1920, a series of explosions in 1939, and two bombs in 1992. On Saturday [[15 June]] [[1996]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) detonated a large bomb adjacent to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb caused over 200 injuries, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows half a mile away. The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at [[Pound sterling|GB£]]50&nbsp;million, but this was quickly revised upwards.<ref name="1996 IRA costs">{{cite book | title=A History of Manchester| url=http://www.phillimore.co.uk/acatalog/info_1860772404.html| first=Stuart Hylton| date=2003| pages=pg. 227–230| publisher=Phillimore & Co Ltd|isbn=1860772404}}</ref> The final insurance payout has been estimated at over GB£400&nbsp;million; many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade.<ref name="IRA business">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/3704943.stm|title=Panorama - The cost of terrorism|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=[[BBC]]|year=2004}}</ref>

==Governance==
{{main|Politics in Manchester}}
[[Image:ManchesterTownHall OwlofDoom.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Manchester Town Hall]], used for the local governance of Manchester, is an example of [[Victorian era]] [[Gothic revival]] architecture.]]
Manchester is represented by three tiers of government, [[Manchester City Council]] ("local"), UK Parliament ("national"), and European Parliament ("Europe"). [[Greater Manchester County Council]] administration was abolished in 1986, and so the city is effectively a [[unitary authority]]. Since its inception in 1995, Manchester has been a member of the [[English Core Cities Group]],<ref name="Core city">{{Cite web|url=http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Introduction/about.html|title=About the Core Cities Group|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=[[English Core Cities Group]]|year=2004}}</ref> which, amongst other things, serves to promote the social, cultural and economic status of the city at an international level.

The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301 but lost [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] by a court case in 1359. Until the 19th century local government was largely provided by manorial courts which were not finally ended until 1846.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm|date=[[2003-07-31]]|title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Records Office]]|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> 
From [[History of Lancashire|a very early time]], the township of Manchester lay within the [[historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> It formed its own ecclesiastical parish and [[Poor Law Union]] by the name of Manchester.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1792 commissioners, usually known as police commissioners, were established for the social improvement Manchester. In 1838 Manchester regained borough status, and comprised the townships of [[Beswick, Greater Manchester|Beswick]], [[Cheetham Hill]], [[Chorlton upon Medlock]] and [[Hulme]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> By 1846 the Borough Council had taken over the powers of the police commissioners. In 1853 Manchester was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> 

In 1885 [[Bradford, Greater Manchester|Bradford]], [[Harpurhey]], [[Rusholme]] and parts of [[Moss Side]] and [[Withington]] townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889 the city became the [[County borough]] of Manchester, which was external to the [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire, and thus not governed by [[Lancashire County Council]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city from Lancashire, including former villages such as [[Burnage]], [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], [[Didsbury]], [[Fallowfield]], [[Levenshulme]], [[Longsight]], [[Withington]]. In 1931 the [[Cheshire]] [[civil parish]]es of [[Baguley]], [[Northenden]] and Northern Etchells from the south of the [[River Mersey]] were added.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1974, by way of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the City of Manchester became a [[metropolitan district]] of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In this year, [[Ringway]] was also added to the city which is now home to the airport.

Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines, which can often be capped with snow in the winter months. Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city.

Manchester has a wide variety of buildings, ranging from [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] to [[Contemporary architecture]]. The widespread use of [[red brick]] characterises the city. Much of the architecture in the city harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade.<ref name="Hartwell"/> Just outside the immediate city centre is a large number of ex-[[cotton mill]]s, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure whilst many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space.

When the [[Second World War|war]] ended in 1945, reconstruction work began while United ground-shared with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. The rebuilt Old Trafford was opened in 1949, and was further enhanced during the mid 1960s by the addition of a cantilever stand. By 1993, the stadium had become all-seater following the reconstruction of the iconic Stretford End terrace. The 30-year-old cantilever stand was demolished in 1995, and replaced by the three-tier North Stand, increasing the stadium capacity to more than 55,000 spectators all-seated. In 2000, further expansion to the "goal end" parts of the stadium took the capacity to nearly 68,000. By 2006, another expansion had taken the capacity to well over 70,000. For much of its history, Old Trafford has been the largest club stadium in [[England]], and has hosted numerous [[FA Cup]] semi-finals as well as a [[European Cup]] final and countless [[England national football team|England]] games.

[[City of Manchester Stadium]] was opened in 2002 for the [[Commonwealth Games]], and one of the stadium's stands was subsequently replaced in preparation for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City's]] arrival there a year later. It now holds 48,000 fans all-seated, and is one of the largest football stadiums in England.

[[Image:Canal Street, Manchester.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Canal Street (Manchester)|Canal Street]], one of Manchester's most active nightspots, part of the city's gay village.]]
Manchester played several key roles in the development of [[nightclub]] and [[DJ]] culture (see main article on [[Culture of Manchester]]). One of the oldest venues is the [[Band on the Wall]], a live music club in the [[Northern Quarter]]. It was built around 1862 as the flagship pub of a local brewery and originally called The George & Dragon. In 1975 it was taken on by jazz musician Steve Morris and Frank Cusick, and renamed The Band on the Wall, a longtime nickname for the club since the late 1920s alluding to its stage high on the back wall.<ref name="BOTW">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bandonthewall.org/history.html|title=A discussion with Johnny Roadhouse persuaded him to stick with the name Band on the Wall|accessdate=2007-07-15|publisher=www.bandonthewall.org|year=2007}}</ref>

Along with other areas that are frequented by late night revellers (such as [[Castlefield]], Deansgate Locks, the Printworks and the [[Northern Quarter]]), Manchester boasts the famous [[Canal Street (Manchester)|Canal Street]], the centre of the city's gay community. This was made famous by the [[Channel 4]] programme, [[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|'Queer as Folk']], and is the centre of the annual Pride celebrations, held on the last weekend in August.

Bands that have emerged from the Manchester music scene include [[The Smiths]], the [[Buzzcocks]], [[The Fall]], [[Joy Division]] and its successor group [[New Order]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Doves]]. Manchester was credited as the main regional driving force behind [[Indie music|indie]] bands of the 1980s including [[Happy Mondays]], [[The Charlatans]], [[Inspiral Carpets]], [[James (band)|James]], and [[The Stone Roses]]. These groups came from what became known as the "Madchester" scene that also centred around the legendary club Fac 51 Haçienda (also known as simply [[The Haçienda]]) developed by founder of [[factory records]] [[Anthony Wilson]]. Subsequently [[The Chemical Brothers]], although from southern England, formed in Manchester.

===Literature===
In the 19th century, Manchester featured in novels highlighting the changes that industrialisation had brought to Britain. These included works such as ''Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life'' (1848) by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]],[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/gaskell_elizabeth.shtml] and ''The Condition of the English Working Class in 1844'', written by [[Friedrich Engels]] while living and working in Manchester. [[Charles Dickens]] is reputed to have set his novel ''[[Hard Times]]'' in the city, and while it is partly modelled on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Elizabeth Gaskell.[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva27.html]

Erstwhile producer and radio personality [[Karl Pilkington]], of ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' fame, hails from Manchester.

Manchester is featured in films such as ''My Son, My Son!'' (1940), directed by [[Charles Vidor]] and starring [[Brian Aherne]] and [[Louis Hayward]].

''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper was founded in Manchester in 1821 as ''The Manchester Guardian''. Its head office is still in Manchester, though many of its management functions were moved to [[London]] in 1964. It shares an office on Hardman Street with sister publication ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' (biggest-selling daily paper although now free within the city centre), and the Manchester Metro News (free weekly, Greater Manchester's biggest-circulation newspaper). Another free newspaper is the [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] North West, available from [[Metrolink]] stops, rail stations and other busy locations.

For many years most of the national newspapers had offices in Manchester: ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''. Only ''[[The Daily Sport]]'' remains based in Manchester. At its height, 1,500 journalists were employed. But in the 1980s office closures began and today the "second Fleet Street" is no more. A late attempt to launch a Northern daily newspaper, ''North West Times'', floundered in the late 1980s lasting just three months. Another attempt was made with the ''[[North West Enquirer]]'', which hoped to provide a true "regional" newspaper for the [[North West England|North West]], much in the same vein as the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' does for [[Yorkshire]] or ''[[The Northern Echo]]'' does for the [[North East England|North East]], however it folded in October 2006. There are several local lifestyle magazines, including 'YQ Magazine' and 'Moving Manchester'.
