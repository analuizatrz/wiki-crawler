'''IK Pegasi''' is a [[spectroscopic binary]] [[star system]] in the [[constellation]] [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]. The primary (IK Pegasi A) is a [[main sequence]], [[spectral class]] A star that displays minor pulsations in luminosity.<ref name="nras278" /> The companion (IK Pegasi B) is a high-temperature [[white dwarf]]; a star that has evolved past the main sequence and is no longer generating energy through [[nuclear fusion]]. The two stars are separated from each other by about 31 million kilometres (or 0.21 [[Astronomical unit]]s), and orbit around their common [[barycenter]] every 21.7 days.

This is the nearest known [[supernova]] candidate to the [[Solar System]]. When the primary begins to evolve into a [[red giant]], it is expected to share a common gaseous envelope with the white dwarf. The later star will begin to [[Accretion (science)|accrete]] matter from the primary, and, when it approaches the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of 1.44 [[solar mass]]es, it will explode as a Type Ia supernova.<ref>{{cite news | first=Eugenie | last=Samuel | title=Supernova poised to go off near Earth | publisher=New Scientish | date=May 23, 2002 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2311 | accessdate=2007-01-18 }}</ref>

==Observation==
This star system was catalogued in the 1862 ''[[Durchmusterung|Bonn Durchmusterung]]'' ("Bonn astrometric Survey") as BD&nbsp;+18°4794B. It later appeared in [[Edward Charles Pickering|Pickering's]] 1908 ''[[Bright Star Catalogue|Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue]]'' as HR 8210.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pickering | first = Edward Charles | title=Revised Harvard photometry : a catalogue of the positions, photometric magnitudes and spectra of 9110 stars, mainly of the magnitude 6.50, and brighter observed with the 2 and 4 inch meridian photometers | journal=Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College | year=1908 | volume=50 | pages=182 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1908AnHar..50....1P }}</ref> The designation "IK Pegasi" follows the expanded form of the [[variable star designation|variable star nomenclature]] introduced by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander|Friedrich W. Argelander]].

Examination of the [[spectrograph]]ic features of this star showed that characteristic [[absorption line]] shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the members stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a shift in the wavelength of the line features. (See [[redshift]].) The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity of at least one of the stars, even when they are unable to resolve the individual components.

In 1927, the Canadian astronomer [[William Edmund Harper|William E. Harper]] used this technique to measure the period of this single-line spectroscopic binary, and determined it to be 21.724 days. He also estimated the [[orbital eccentricity]] as 0.0, which is the value for a circular orbit. The velocity amplitude was measured as 41.5 km/s, which is the maximum velocity of the primary component along the line of sight to the Solar System.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Falk | first = Michael | title=The orbits of A Persei and HR 8210 | journal=Publications of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory | year=1927 | volume=4 | pages=161-169 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998RPPh...61...77K }}</ref>

The distance to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny [[parallax]] shifts of this system against the more distant background, as the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the [[Hipparcos]] spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 [[light year]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author=M. A. C. Perryman, L. Lindegren, J. Kovalevsky, E. Hoeg, U. Bastian, P. L. Bernacca, M. Crézé, F. Donati, M. Grenon, F. van Leeuwen, H. van der Marel, F. Mignard, C. A. Murray, R. S. Le Poole, H. Schrijver, C. Turon, F. Arenou, M. Froeschlé, C. S. Petersen | title=The HIPPARCOS Catalogue | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | year=1997 | volume=323 | pages=L49-L52 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1997A&A...323L..49P }}</ref> The same spacecraft also measured the [[proper motion]] of this system; the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky due to its motion through space.

The combination of the distance and proper motion of this system gives the [[space velocity]] of IK Pegasi in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight. The third component, the heliocentric [[radial velocity]], can be measured by the average [[red-shift]] (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The ''General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities'' lists a radial velocity of -11.4&nbsp;km/s for this system.<ref>{{cite book  | last=Wilson | first=Ralph Elmer | year=1953 | title=General catalogue of stellar radial velocities | publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1953QB901.W495..... }}</ref>

==Component A==
The [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] is a plot of [[luminosity]] versus surface [[temperature]] for a set of stars. IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the [[instability strip]]. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.<ref name="araa33">{{cite journal | author=A. Gautschy, H. Saio | title=Stellar Pulsations Across The HR Diagram: Part 1 | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | year=1995 | volume=33 | pages=75-114 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ARA&A..33...75G }}</ref>

The pulsations result from a process called the ''&kappa;''-mechanism. A part of the star's atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements, which causes the atmosphere to expand in compensation. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and looses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere, and a matching variation of the luminosity.<ref name="araa33" />

Stars within the portion of the instability strip that crosses the main sequence are called [[Delta Scuti variable]]s. (Named after the prototypical star for such variables: [[Delta Scuti]].) Delta Scuti variables typically range from spectral class A2 to F8, and a stellar luminosity class of III ([[subgiant]]s) to V ([[main sequence]] stars). They are short-period variables that have a regular pulsation rate between 0.025 and 0.25 days. Delta Scuti stars have an abundance of elements similar to the Sun's ([[Population I]] stars), and between 1.5 and 2.5 [[solar mass]]es.<ref> {{cite web | last = Templeton | first = Matthew | year = 2004 | url = http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/summer04.shtml | title = Variable Star of the Season: Delta Scuti and the Delta Scuti variables | publisher = AAVSO | accessdate = 2007-01-23 }}</ref>

The spectrum star is classified as marginal Am (or "Am:"), which means it displays the characteristics of a spectral class A but is marginally metallic-lined. That is, the atmosphere of this star displays slightly (but anomalously) higher than normal absorption line strengths for elements heavier than [[Lithium]].<ref name="apj221" /> Stars of spectral type Am are often members of close binaries with a companion of about the same mass, as is the case for IK Pegasi.<ref>{{cite journal | author=J. G. Mayer, J. Hakkila | title=Photometric Effects of Binarity on AM Star Broadband Colors | journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society | year=1994 | volume=26 | pages=868 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994AAS...184.0607M }}</ref>

Spectral class A stars are hotter more massive than the Sun, but, in consequence, their life span on the main sequence is ...
