'''Michael Alfred Gartner''' (born October 29, 1959 in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]) is a retired Canadian professional [[ice hockey]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] who played 19 seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] for the [[Washington Capitals]], [[Minnesota North Stars]], [[New York Rangers]], [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Phoenix Coyotes]]. He also played one season in the defunct [[World Hockey Association]] for the [[Cincinnati Stingers]].

==Playing career==
Gartner was drafted in the 1st round, 4th overall, by the [[Washington Capitals]] in the [[1979 NHL Entry Draft]]. Mike Gartner started his professional career playing in the WHA as an underager with the [[Cincinnati Stingers]] in [[1978–79 WHA season|1978–79]]. He played on a line with [[Mark Messier]] and had a successful campaign, finishing second to [[Wayne Gretzky]] for Rookie-of-the-Year honors. As a result, with the WHA folding at the end of the season, he played the next season with the Capitals, and would play for them for the better part of ten seasons. He recorded an assist in his NHL debut on October 11, 1979, versus the [[Buffalo Sabres]], and he wore number eleven for the Caps.

Gartner had a solid season in [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80]], winning the Capitals' Rookie of the Year and MVP awards, as well as being voted by their fans as the team's Most Promising Player. He also led the team with 36 goals. Gartner was traded to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] on March 7, 1989, with [[Larry Murphy (ice hockey)|Larry Murphy]] for [[Dino Ciccarelli]] and [[Bob Rouse]]. He left the Capitals as the team's all-time leader in career goals, assists and points, and currently stands second in those three categories.

However, Gartner only lasted one season with Minnesota and was traded to the [[New York Rangers]] on March 6, 1990, for [[Ulf Dahlén]], a draft pick and future considerations. He had a strong start with the Rangers scoring two goals in his debut versus the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. In fact, he scored eleven goals and sixteen points in the remaining twelve regular season games the Rangers played that year. In [[1991–92 NHL season|1991–92]], he became the first player in NHL history to score his 500th goal, 500th assist, and 1000th point all in the same season. The next season, Gartner became the first Ranger to score at least 40 goals in three consecutive seasons. He also scored four goals in the [[NHL All-Star Game]] and earned the All-Star Game MVP award.

In [[1993–94 NHL season|1993–94]], Gartner was traded to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] for [[Glenn Anderson]], a minor leaguer and a draft pick. He played with the Leafs until 1996, when he was traded to the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], who had just re-located from [[Winnipeg]]. Gartner scored the first goal and hat trick in Phoenix history on October 7 against the [[Boston Bruins]], in the franchise's second game. He played two seasons with the Coyotes before retiring in August, 1998.

Gartner was also active with the [[NHL Players Association]]. He served as president of the [[NHLPA]] from 1996 until his retirement in 1998 and served as Chairman of the Goals & Dreams program with the [[NHLPA]]. He resigned from the NHLPA on March 19, 2007.<ref>[http://www.nhlpa.com/MediaReleases/ReleaseDetails.asp?mediaReleaseDisplayId=%7BD5A411E0-FF6F-49D6-9553-9B8A90AAF094%7D Gartner steps down from NHLPA post]</ref>

Gartner is a [[Born-again Christian]], and was introduced to the faith during his playing days by former Washington teammate [[Jean Pronovost]]. His son, Josh, played goalie for [[Yale University]].

==Distinction==
Despite his impressive career, Gartner never won the Stanley Cup or played in the Cup finals, never won an NHL award, and was never named to the postseason All-Star Team. He shares this distinction with former Leafs teammate [[Wendel Clark]]. Only [[Phil Housley]] has played in more games (1495) than Gartner without winning the Cup, though Housley participated in the 1998 Finals. 

He was a member of the New York Rangers team that would go on to win the championship in 1994, but he was traded to Toronto at the trade deadline. However, Gartner got farther than he ever would in the playoffs that same year, as the Maple Leafs made it to the Conference Finals before losing to the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in 5 games. He was traded close to the NHL trading deadline three times in his career, and had a knack for producing immediately for those teams, as in a combined 35 games with his new teams during the regular season after the mid-season deals, he had 24 goals, 18 assists, 42 points, and a +16 rating.

Gartner was noted for his consistency during his career, as he did not miss a game in eight of his nineteen NHL seasons, and he led his team in goals nine times during his career. He holds an NHL record of 15 consecutive 30+ goal seasons—a streak that was ended by the [[1994–95 NHL lockout]] that shortened the season to 48 games. [[Jaromír Jágr]] is currently tied with this streak. Despite only once scoring more than 50 goals in a single season, Gartner became only the fifth player in NHL history to reach 700 goals (subsequently, [[Brett Hull]] also achieved the 700 goal milestone). Since his totals were strong but never close to the scoring leaders, Gartner never made the First Team All-Star or Second Team All-Star, nor won a major [[NHL award]].

Gartner is also known for his blazing on-ice speed and ability to beat defenders down the ice.

On September 2, 2008, the Washington Capitals announced they will be retiring Gartner's #11 on December 28.<ref>[http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=380933 Caps will retire Mike Gartner's jersey at Dec. 28 pre-game ceremony]</ref> He is just the fourth Capital to receive this honor.
