At the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2007 Mayer won [[Best Pop Vocal Album]] for ''Continuum'' and [[Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for "[[Waiting on the World to Change]]".

By the end of 2002, ''Room for Squares'' had spawned several radio hits, including “No Such Thing”, “[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]”, and ultimately, “[[Why Georgia]]”. In 2003, Mayer won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for “Your Body Is a Wonderland”. In his acceptance speech he remarked, “This is very, very fast, and I promise to catch up.”<ref>Bream, Jon (2007).

In 2003, Mayer released a live CD and DVD of a concert in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] entitled, ''[[Any Given Thursday]]''. The concert featured songs previously not recorded, such as "Man on the Side" (co-written with Cook) and "[[Something's Missing]]", which later appeared on ''[[Heavier Things]]''. The concert also included "Covered In Rain". According to the accompanying DVD documentary, this song is "part two" of the song "City Love", which features the line "covered in rain". Commercially, the album quickly peaked at number seventeen on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. The CD/DVD received conservative, although consistent, praise, with critics torn between his pop-idol image, and (at the time) emerging guitar prowess. Erik Crawford (of [[All Music Guide]]) asked "Is he the consummate guitar hero exemplified when he plays a cover of Stevie Ray Vaughan's 'Lenny', or is he the teen idol that the pubescent girls shriek for after he plays 'Your Body Is a Wonderland?'"<ref>Crawford, Erik (2003).

===Philanthropic activities===
In 2002, Mayer began the "Back To You" Fund, a non-profit organization that focuses on fundraising in the areas of health care, education, the arts, and talent development. The foundation raises funds through the auction of exclusive John Mayer items, such as [[plectrums]], t-shirts, and signed CDs, made available on Mayer's auction site.

In a ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Mayer recalled that after former Columbia Records head, [[Don Ienner]], panned ''Continuum'', he briefly considered quitting music and studying design full time.<!-- However, he soon wrote "Waiting on the World to Change," thus reinvigorating both the album and his music career.--><ref name=RS06/> Mayer's interest in design, however, had long manifested itself in a number of ways. In 2003, [[Martin Guitars]] gave Mayer his own signature model acoustic guitar called the OM-28 John Mayer.<ref name=OM-28>(2003).

===Writing===
With the [[June 1]], [[2004]], issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Mayer began a column called, "Music Lessons with John Mayer". Each article featured a lesson and his (often humorous) take on various topics, both of personal and popular interest. In the August 2005 issue, he invited readers to create music for orphaned lyrics he had written.<ref name=contest>Mayer, John (September 2005), [http://www.esquire.com/features/articles/2005/050804_mfe_mayer.html "The Giveaway: John Mayer's Songwriting Contest"] ''Esquire''.

''Esquire''. '''145''' (1):38</ref>

Mayer has been active online, and has maintained four blogs: a MySpace page, a blog at his official site, another at Honeyee.com, as well as a [[photoblog]] at StunningNikon.com. Although they primarily deal with career-related matters, they also contain jokes, comic videos, his convictions, and his personal activities; they occasionally overlap in content. He is noted for writing the blogs himself, and not through a publicist.<ref name=time100/><ref name=MandS/> His official blog's entry for [[2008-01-23]] contained a graphic that read, "Done & Dusted & Self Conscious & Back to Work." followed by the quote "There is danger in theoretical speculation of battle, in prejudice, in
false reasoning, in pride, in [[wiktionary:braggadocio|braggadocio]]. There is one safe resource,
the return to nature..";{{cref|c}} all the previous blog entries were deleted.<ref>Mayer, John ([[2008-01-23]]), [http://www.johnmayer.com/blog/john/200801 Untitled] JohnMayer.com. Retrieved [[2008-01-31]]</ref> He has since changed the contents of the blog entry several times.

Stand-up comedy is a growing hobby of Mayer's. He makes regular, although random, appearances at the famed [[Comedy Cellar]] when he is in New York. He says that although it is risky, it helps him write better.<ref name=RS06/> He has also created two internet videos - the first is a parody of the "2 Girls, 1 Cup" video where he and [[Sherrod Small]] eat chocolate ice cream, the second is a parody of his own song-writing process, where he portrays himself as a hack and an overconfident jerk.

==Touring==
Despite being principally a solo musician, Mayer has toured with many groups, including [[Maroon 5]],<ref name=RS>Dansby, Andrew (2004).

Mayer allows audio taping at most of his live performances, and he also allows for the non-commercial trading of those recordings. He does this to give fans the opportunity to recreate the live experience, and to encourage fan interaction.<ref name=Local83>[http://www.local-83.com/web/guest/v2policies General Information] Local 83: Listener's Union.

Mayer has a number of tattoos. These include: "Home" and "Life" (from the song title) on the back of his left and right arms respectively, "77" (his year of birth) on the left side of his chest, and a [[koi]]-like fish on his right shoulder. His entire left arm is covered in a [[sleeve tattoo]] that he acquired gradually, ending in April 2008; it includes: "SRV" (for his idol Stevie Ray Vaughan) on his shoulder, a decorated rectangle on his biceps, a dragon-like figure on his inner arm, and various other floral designs.

{{cnote|a|Generally, it was believed that Mayer's father, a [[Bridgeport High School]] principal, had given him a tape player (confiscated from a student) that happened to contain [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] album. However, in a 2006 interview on the New Zealand show ''[[Close Up]]'' (and other interviews), Mayer said that this wasn't true.<ref name=CU/>}}
