'''Paramore''' (pronounced "Par-a-mour" ({{IPAEng|ˈpærəmɔər}})) is a [[Grammy]]-nominated [[United States|American]] [[pop rock]]<ref name="poprock">{{cite web| title= Paramore| publisher= mp3.com| url= http://www.mp3.com/artist/paramore/summary/| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref> band that formed in [[Franklin, Tennessee]] in 2004. After several lineup changes, Paramore now primarily consists of Hayley Williams ([[lead vocals]]/[[keyboard]]), Josh Farro ([[lead guitar]]/[[backing vocals]]), Jeremy Davis ([[Bass Guitar|bass]]), and Zac Farro ([[Drum kit|drums]]). 

Influenced by the likes of [[Jimmy Eat World]] and [[Sunny Day Real Estate]],<ref name="prog">{{cite news| title= Paramore in prog shock rock?| publisher= manchestereveningnews.co.uk| url= http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/music/rock_and_pop/s/1015556_paramore_in_prog_rock_shock| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> frontwoman Hayley Williams and lead guitarist Josh Farro are the group's primary songwriters. In 2005, the group released their debut album ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'', gaining a fanbase through touring and internet promotion of the [[singles (music)|singles]] "[[Pressure (Paramore song)|Pressure]]" and "[[Emergency (song)|Emergency]]". By 2007, the band gained mainstream notoriety with their second album ''[[Riot!]]'' which was certified [[RIAA Certification|gold]]. The first single, "[[Misery Business]]", has received wide radio airplay and allowed for MTV to feature the band in Artist of the Week segments during August 2007. With their early success, much attention is paid to the young age of the band members; their ages range from 17 to 22.<ref>{{cite news| last= Mandia| first= Delia Rosa| title= Paramore rocks at a young age | publisher= ''Staten Island Advance''| date= [[2007-06-24]]| url= http://www.silive.com/living/advance/index.ssf?/base/living/118268101157980.xml&coll=1| accessdate= 2007-09-30}}</ref>

===Formation and ''All We Know Is Falling'' (2002-2005)===

They took the name Paramore, which is derived from the maiden name of one of the group's former bassists  during the time in which they were "still playing in the garage"<ref>{{cite video| people= Paramore | title= Hello My Name is Paramore| medium= Website| publisher= paramore.net| url= http://www.paramore.net/video| accessdate= 2007-12-14}}</ref> once the group learned the meaning of the identically-sounding word ''[[paramour]]'' ("secret lover"), they decided to adopt the name, using the ''Paramore'' spelling.<ref name="Euro">{{cite interview |subject=Josh Farro |subject2=Hayley Williams |subject3= Jeremy Davis| interviewer=cathyreay |title= Interview With Paramore |date=[[2007-07-14]]| url=http://www.europunk.net/interviews.php?id=173 |accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> The band's first song written together was "Conspiracy", which was later used on their debut album.<ref name="hitherson">{{cite news| title= Paramore: All We Know Is Falling| publisher= hitherson.com| date= [[2006-06-15]]| url= http://hitherston.com/press/?p=8| accessdate= 2007-09-30}}</ref>

Over the following years, Paramore performed at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals [[Purple Door]] and [[Warped Tour]]. [[John Janick]], CEO and co-founder of the music label [[Fueled by Ramen]], got ahold of Paramore's demos and went to a [[Taste of Chaos]] performance in [[Orlando, Florida]] to see the band perform live. After a smaller private performance at a warehouse, the band was signed to the label in April 2005.<ref name="Trades">{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| subject2=Josh Farro| interviewer= Tony Pascarella |title= Interview: Hayley Williams and Josh Farro of Paramore| date= [[2005-08-08]]| url= http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440 | accessdate= 2007-08-16}}</ref>

Paramore traveled back to Orlando to record their debut album ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'', but, shortly after arriving, Davis opted to leave the band citing personal reasons. The remaining four members of Paramore continued with the album, writing "[[All We Know]]" about his departure, and later deciding to base ''All We Know Is Falling'' around the concept. The album artwork also reflected Paramore's grief as Williams explains, "The couch [on the cover of ''All We Know is Falling''] with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space."<ref name="Trades"/> Recording for ''All We Know is Falling'' had taken three weeks, and promotional material for the album had only featured the four of the remaining members. Before touring, the band added John Hembree ([[Bass Guitar|bass]]) to their line up to replace Davis.<ref>{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| interviewer= Jason Schleweis| title= Paramore Interview| date= [[2005-07-14]]| url= http://www.crushmediamagazine.com/paramoreinterview.html| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref> During that summer, Paramore was featured on the Shira Girl Stage of the 2005 Warped Tour.<ref name="Trades"/> After being asked by the band, Davis returned to Paramore, after five months apart, as Hembree left.<ref>{{citation| title= Paramore Kerrang!

Paramore released "[[Pressure (Paramore song)|Pressure]]" as its first single, with a video directed by [[Shane Drake]], but the song had failed to place on the charts. The video featured the band performing in a warehouse, eventually getting sprayed with water sprinklers as the storyline of a conflicted couple occurs. "Pressure" is also featured on the soundtrack to the [[EA Games]] video game ''[[The Sims 2]]'' for the [[Playstation 2]] and [[x-box]]. In July, "[[Emergency (song)|Emergency]]" was released as the second single, the video again reuniting the band with director Shane Drake and featuring Hunter Lamb, who replaced Bynum on guitar.<ref name="AMG"/> The video for "Emergency" showcased Paramore in another performance, this time fixing the members bloody and in worn costumes.

In January of 2006 they were a part of the Winter Go West Tour where they played alongside Seattle bands [[Amber Pacific]] and [[The Lashes]], and in February, Williams' vocals were featured on "Keep Dreaming Upside Down" by [[October Fall]].<ref name="Oct Fall">{{cite web| title= October Fall - A Season in Hell| publisher= AbsolutePunk.net| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=118240 | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> In the spring 2006, Paramore was an opening act on headlining tours for both [[Bayside (band)|Bayside]] and soon afterwards, [[The Rocket Summer]].

In 2007, Paramore was named by British  magazine ''[[NME]]'' as one of ten bands to watch out for in their "New Noise 2007" feature.<ref name="FBR"/> In January, the band played an acoustic set for the grand opening of a Warped Tour exhibit at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]],<ref name="R&R">{{cite news| title= Warped adds Agent Orange, video from Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame exhibit| publisher= punknews.org| date= [[2007-02-09]]| url= http://www.punknews.org/article/22158 | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> and the dress Williams wore in the video for "Emergency" was also put onto display in the exhibit.<ref name="Dress">{{cite news| last= Moseley| first= Brittany| title= Warped Tour: Thirteen years of memorabilia to Cleveland| publisher= Stater Online| date= [[2007-01-31]]| url= http://media.www.stateronline.com/media/storage/paper867/news/2007/02/01/Entertainment/Warped.Tour.Thirteen.Years.Of.Memorabilia.To.Cleveland-2689838.shtml | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> Paramore was featured in ''Kerrang!'' magazine once more, however, Williams believed the article was an untrue portrayal of the band, particularly because it focused on her as the main component.

==Musical style and influences==
{{POV section|date=January 2008}}
The majority of Paramore's recordings come from collaborations between lead vocalist Hayley Williams and lead guitarist Josh Farro &mdash; Farro first writes the music, afterwords taking it to Williams for a melody and lyrics, and from that point the song worked out between the two.<ref name="Trades"/> Once the foundation is laid out, the remaining band members help to work on sound and arrangement. The duo's songwriting has been called "contrastly cliched and weak at points"<ref>{{cite web| title= Riot!

Joshua Martin had written after an interview with Williams, "The band isn't just a short pop-punk girl with red hair and a spunky attitude. Their music is like them, it's aged differently. It's sped up, and slowed down. It's emo without being whiney, or bratty.

Although they believe themselves to be considered a pop music band by others, they were influenced by various rock music artists. Paramore has expressed their influence for creating the band and their music had come from appreciation for [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Sunny Day Real Estate]]<ref name="prog"/>, [[Death Cab for Cutie]] and [[Failure (band)|Failure]]; Williams citing her personal influences as [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]] and [[Etta James]].<ref>{{cite news| title= Questions and Answers with Paramore| publisher= paramore-fans.com| date= [[2007-09-19]]| url= http://www.paramore-fans.com/article/2/questions-and-answers-with-paramore| accessdate= 2007-10-13}}</ref> Williams explained that bands such as [[U2]], "who are massive, and do whatever they want, write whatever they want and they stand for something", Jimmy Eat World, "who I don’t think ever disappoint their fans," and No Doubt, who "have done amazing things," act as a pattern for the path in which Paramore would like to take their career. <ref name="prog"/>
