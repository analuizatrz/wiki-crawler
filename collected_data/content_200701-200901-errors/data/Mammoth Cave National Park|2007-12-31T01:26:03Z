'''Mammoth Cave National Park''' is a [[U.S. National Park]] in central [[Kentucky]], encompassing portions of Mammoth Cave, the most elongated [[cave]] system known in the world. The official name of the system is the Mammoth Cave System for the ridge under which the cave has formed. The park was established as a [[national park]] on [[July 1]], [[1941]]. It became a [[World Heritage Site]] on [[October 27]], [[1981]], and an international [[Biosphere Reserve]] on [[September 26]], [[1990]].

The park's 52,830 acres (214 km²) are located in [[Edmonson County, Kentucky]], with small areas extending eastward into [[Hart County, Kentucky|Hart County]] and [[Barren County, Kentucky|Barren County]]. It is centered around the [[Green River (Kentucky)|Green River]], with a [[tributary]], the [[Nolin River]], feeding into the Green just inside the park. The Green River is 
dammed near the western boundary of the park, so that the river only flows freely for a small section in the eastern part of the park.

==Limestone labyrinth==
Mammoth Cave developed in thick [[Mississippian]]-aged [[limestone]] [[Stratum|strata]] capped by a layer of [[sandstone]], making the system remarkably stable. It is known to include more than 367 miles (591 kilometers) of passageway; new discoveries and connections add several miles to this figure each year.

The upper sandstone member is known as the [[Big Clifty Sandstone]]: thin, sparse layers of limestone interspersed within the sandstones give rise to an epikarstic zone, in which tiny conduits (cave passages too small to enter) are dissolved. The epikarstic zone concentrates local flows of runoff into high-elevation springs which emerge at the edges of ridges. The resurgent water from these springs typically flows briefly on the surface before sinking underground again at elevation of the contact between the sandstone caprock and the underlying massive limestones. It is in these underlying massive limestone layers that the [[Caving|human-explorable caves]] of the region are developed.

The limestone layers of the [[stratigraphic]] column beneath the Big Clifty, in increasing order of depth below the ridgetops, are the [[Girkin Formation]], the [[Ste. Genevieve Limestone]], and the [[St. Louis Limestone]]. For example, the large Main Cave passage seen on the Historic Tour is located at the bottom of the Girkin and the top of the St. Genevieve.

[[Image:Mammoth cave 01 - 1887.jpg|thumb|left|225px| '''The Bottomless Pit in Mammoth Cave - Woodcut dated 1887''' (''From the Nuno Carvalho de Sousa Private Collections - Lisbon)]]''

Each of the primary layers of limestone are divided further into named units and subunits. One area of cave research involves correlating the stratigraphy with the cave survey produced by explorers. This makes it possible to produce three dimensional approximate maps of the contours of the various layer boundaries without the necessity for boring test wells and extracting core samples.

The upper sandstone caprock is relatively hard for water to penetrate: the exceptions are where vertical cracks occur. This protective role means that many of the older, upper passages of the cave system are very dry, with no [[stalactite]]s, [[stalagmite]]s, or other formations which require flowing or dripping water to develop. 

However, the sandstone caprock layer has been dissolved and eroded at many locations within the park, such as the Frozen Niagara room. The "contact" between limestone and sandstone can be found by hiking from the valley bottoms to the ridgetops: typically, as one approaches the top of a ridge, the outcrops of exposed rock seen change in composition from limestone to sandstone at a well-defined elevation, neglecting slump blocks of sandstone which have broken off the ridgetops and tumbled down the limestone slopes below.

At one valley bottom in the southern region of the park, a massive [[sinkhole]] has developed, called Cedar Sink, which features a small river entering one side and disappearing back underground at the other side.

Mammoth Cave is home to the [[endangered species|endangered]] [[Kentucky cave shrimp]], a sightless albino [[shrimp]].

==Visiting==
[[Image:Mammoth_Cave_tour.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ranger guided tour of the cave.]] 
The [[National Park Service]] offers several cave tours to visitors. Many of the most famous features of the cave, such as Grand Avenue, Frozen Niagara, and Fat Man's Misery, can be seen on lighted tours ranging from one to six hours in length. Two tours, lit only by visitor-carried paraffin lamps, are popular alternatives to the electric-lit routes. Several "wild" tours venture away from the developed parts of the cave into muddy crawls and dusty tunnels.

The park's tours are notable for the quality of the interpretive program, with occasional graphics accompanying artifacts on display at certain points in the cave. The lectures delivered by the National Park Service cave guides are varied by tour, so that in taking several tours the visitor learns about different facets of the cave's formation, or of the cave's human history and prehistory. Most guides are quite knowledgeable and open to visitor's questions. Many guides include a "theatrical" component, making their presentations entertaining with gentle humor. The guide traditions at Mammoth Cave date back to the period just after the [[War of 1812]], and to  guides such as [[Stephen Bishop (cave explorer)|Stephen Bishop]]. The style of this humor itself is part of the living tradition of the cave guides, and is duly a part of the interpretive program.

The Echo River Tour, one of the cave's most famous attractions, used to take visitors on a boat ride along an underground river. The tour was discontinued for logistic and environmental reasons in the early 1990s.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/maca/faqs.htm Mammoth Cave National Park - Frequently Asked Questions]</ref>

Interested members of the public can join an Earthwatch.org sponsored field survey of the history of Mammoth Cave.<ref>[http://www.earthwatch.org/expeditions/crothers.html Earthwatch.org Sponsored Field Survey]</ref> However, due to Mammoth Cave park regulations, participation on this project is restricted to US citizens only.

==History==
The story of human beings in relation to Mammoth Cave is a long one, spanning six thousand years. It is also a complex story, involving not only themes of human exploration and exploitation of the cave, but the lifeways of the cultures which have lived in the surrounding region. The relation between people and their environment is always bidirectional, and this is exemplified in the history of the Mammoth Cave region.
===Prehistory===
Several sets of Native American remains have been recovered from Mammoth Cave, or other nearby caves in the region, in both the [[19th century|19th]] and [[20th century|20th]] centuries, by 1813 on the early side (the "Short Cave Mummy.") Most mummies found present examples of intentional burial, with ample evidence of pre-Columbian funerary practice. 

An exception to purposeful burial was discovered when in 1935 the remains of an adult male were discovered by [[Grover Campbell]] and [[Lyman Cutliff]] under a huge boulder. The boulder had shifted and settled onto the victim, a pre-Columbian miner, who had disturbed the rubble supporting it.  The remains of the ancient victim were named "Lost John" and exhibited to the public into the 1970s, when they were interred in a secret location in Mammoth Cave for reasons of preservation as well as emerging political sensitivities with respect to the public display of Native American remains.

Research beginning in the late 1950s led by Dr. [[Patty Jo Watson]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] has done much to illuminate the lives of the late Archaic and early Woodland peoples who explored and exploited caves in the region. Preserved by the constant cave environment, dietary evidence yielded carbon dates enabling Dr. Watson and others to determine the age of the specimens, and an analysis of their content, also pioneered by Dr. Watson, allows determination of the relative content of plant and meat in the diet of either culture over a period spanning several thousand years. This analysis indicates a timed transition from a [[hunter-gatherer]] culture to [[plant domestication]] and [[agriculture]].

Another technique employed in archaeological research at Mammoth Cave was "experimental archaeology", also an innovation of Dr. Watson's, in which modern explorers were sent into the cave using the same technology as that employed by the ancient cultures whose leftover implements lie discarded in many parts of the cave. The goal was to gain insight into the problems faced by the ancient people who explored the cave, by placing the researchers in a similar physical situation.

Ancient human remains and artifacts within the caves are protected by various federal and state laws. One of the most basic facts to be determined about a newly discovered artifact is its precise location and situation. Even slightly moving a prehistoric artifact contaminates it from a research perspective. Explorers are properly trained not to disturb archaeological evidence, and some areas of the cave remain out-of-bounds for even seasoned explorers, unless the subject of the trip is archaeological research on that area.

Besides the remains that have been discovered near the historic entrance of mammoth cave, the remains of cane torches used by Native Americans were found in Salts Cave in Flint Ridge.

===Earliest known history===
[[Image:MapofMammothCave.png|thumb|250px|Map of Mammoth Cave from 1842, penned by Stephen Bishop: unusual for a slave, he was given complete credit.]]
Legend has it that the first European to discover Mammoth Cave was John Houchin, in 1797. While hunting, Houchin pursued a wounded bear to the cave's large entrance opening near the [[Green River]]. Countervailing against this story is Brucker and Watson's ''The Longest Cave'', which asserts that the cave was "certainly known before that time."

The land containing this Historic Entrance was first surveyed and registered in 1798 under the name of Valentine Simons. Simons began exploiting Mammoth Cave for its saltpeter reserves. [[Calcium nitrate]] ([[calcium|Ca]]([[nitrate|NO<sub>3</sub>]])<sub>2</sub>) deposited as bat guano was leached from cave soils and converted via [[Double displacement reaction|double replacement reaction]] with [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]], [[empirical formula]] [[potassium|K]]<sub>2</sub>[[carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub>]]) to produce [[Potassium nitrate]] ([[Potassium|K]][[Nitrogen|N]][[Oxygen|O]]<sub>3</sub>) or [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]], an ingredient of [[gunpowder]].

===19th century===
In partnership with Valentine Simon, various other individuals would own the land through the [[War of 1812]], when Mammoth Cave's saltpeter reserves became significant due to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] blockade of [[United States]]'s ports. The blockade starved the American military of saltpeter and therefore gunpowder. As a result, the domestic price of saltpeter rose and production based on nitrates extracted from caves such as Mammoth Cave became more lucrative.

In July 1812, the cave was purchased from Simon and other owners by Charles Wilkins and an investor from Philadelphia named Hyman Gratz. Soon  the cave was being mined for [[calcium nitrate]] on an industrial scale.

A half-interest in the cave changed hands for ten thousand dollars (a huge sum at the time). After the war when prices fell, the workings were abandoned and it became a minor tourist attraction centering on a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[mummy]] discovered nearby. 

When Wilkins died his estate's executors sold his interest in the cave to Gratz. In the spring of 1838, the cave was sold by the Gratz brothers to Franklin Gorin, who intended to operate Mammoth Cave purely as a tourist attraction, the bottom long having since fallen out of the saltpeter market. Gorin was a slave owner, and used his slaves as tour guides. One of these slaves would make a number of important contributions to human knowledge of the cave, and become one of Mammoth Cave's most celebrated historical figures.

[[Stephen Bishop (cave explorer)|Stephen Bishop]], an [[African-American]] [[History of slavery in the United States|slave]] and a guide to the cave during the 1840s and 1850s, was one of the first persons to make extensive [[map]]s of the cave, and named many of the cave's features.

Stephen Bishop was introduced to Mammoth Cave in 1838 by Franklin Gorin. Gorin wrote, after Bishop's death: "''I placed a guide in the cave --- the celebrated and great Stephen, and he aided in making the discoveries. He was the first person who ever crossed the Bottomless Pit, and he, myself and another person whose name I have forgotten were the only persons ever at the bottom of Gorin's Dome to my knowledge.

"''After Stephen crossed the Bottomless Pit, we discovered all that part of the cave now known beyond that point. Previous to those discoveries, all interest centered in what is known as the "Old Cave" . . . but now many of the points are but little known, although as Stephen was wont to say, they were 'grand, gloomy and peculiar.'<ref>Brucker and Watson 1976, p. 272-273</ref>

In 1839, Dr. [[John Croghan]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] bought the Mammoth Cave Estate, including Bishop and its other slaves from their previous owner, Franklin Gorin. Croghan briefly ran an ill-fated [[tuberculosis]] hospital in the cave, the vapors of which he believed would cure his patients. A widespread epidemic of the period, tuberculosis would ultimately claim the lives of both Bishop and Croghan.

Throughout the 19th century, the fame of Mammoth Cave would grow so that the cave became an international sensation.

At the same time, the cave attracted the attention of 19th century writers such as Dr. Robert Montgomery Bird, the Rev. Robert Davidson, the Rev. Horace Martin, Alexander Clark Bullitt, [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]] (who visited in June 1852), [[Bayard Taylor]] (in May, 1855), Dr. William Stump Forwood (in Spring [[1867]]), the naturalist [[John Muir]] (early September 1867), the Rev. Horace Carter Hovey, and others.<ref>[http://kentuckyexplorer.com/nonmembers/00-05030.html Thompson, Bob: Early Writers Flocked To Mammoth Cave By Bob Thompson - 2000]</ref>

As a result of the growing renown of Mammoth Cave, the cave boasted famous visitors such as actor [[Edwin Booth]], singer [[Jenny Lind]] (who visited the cave on [[April 5]], [[1851]]), and violinist [[Ole Bull]].

===Early 20th century: The Kentucky Cave Wars===
[[Image:MammothCaveNPS.jpg|thumb|300px| Mammoth Cave National Park in the early 1900s]]
The difficulties of farming life in the hardscrabble, poor soil of the cave country influenced local owners of smaller nearby caves to see opportunities for commercial exploitation, particularly given the success of Mammoth Cave as a tourist attraction. The "Kentucky Cave Wars" were a period of bitter competition between local cave owners for tourist money. Broad tactics of deception were used to lure visitors away from their intended destination to these private show caves. Misleading signs were placed along the roads leading to the Mammoth Cave. A typical strategy during the early days of automobile travel involved a representative of a private show cave hopping aboard a tourist's car's running board, to "explain" to the passengers that Mammoth Cave was closed, quarantined, caved in or otherwise inaccessible. 

In 1906, Mammoth Cave became accessible by [[steamboat]] with the construction of a lock and dam at [[Brownsville, Kentucky]]. The construction of this dam has had a long-term impact on the biota of the cave. The dam's construction would also prove to have implications for the story of the cave's exploration.

In 1908, [[Max Kaemper]], a young German mining engineer arrived at the cave by way of New York. Kaemper had just graduated from technical college and his family had sent him on a trip abroad as a graduation present. Originally intending to spend two weeks at Mammoth Cave, Kamper spent several months. With the assistance of [[African-American]] slave descendant Ed Bishop, Kaemper produced a remarkably accurate instrumental survey of many kilometers of Mammoth Cave, including many new discoveries. Reportedly, Kaemper also produced a corresponding survey of the land surface overlying the cave: this information would have been useful in the opening of other entrances to the cave, as soon happened with the Violet City entrance. 

The Crogan family suppressed the topographic element of Kaempers map, and it is not known to survive today, although the cave map portion of Kaemper's work stands as a triumph of accurate cave cartography: not until the early 1960s and the advent of the modern exploration period would these passages be surveyed and mapped with greater accuracy. Kaemper returned to Berlin, and from the point of view of the Mammoth Cave country, disappeared entirely. It was not until the turn of the 21st Century that a group of German tourists, after visiting the cave, researched Kaemper's family and determined his sad fate: the young Kaemper was killed in [[trench warfare]] in [[World War I]] at the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)]] just eight years later.

Famed French cave explorer [[Édouard-Alfred Martel]] visited the cave for three days in October 1912. Without access to the closely held survey data, Martel was permitted to make barometric observations in the cave for the purpose of determining the relative elevation of different locations in the cave. He identified different levels of the cave, and correctly noted that the level of Echo River within the cave was controlled by that of the Green River on the surface. Martel lamented the 1906 construction of the dam at Brownsville, pointing out that this made a full hydrologic study of the cave impossible. Among his precise descriptions of the hydrogeologic setting of Mammoth Cave, Martel offered the speculative conclusion that Mammoth Cave was connected to Salts and Colossal Caves: this would not be proven correct until 60 years after Martel's visit.<ref>Watson 1981 pp. 15-16</ref>

In the early 1920s, George Morrison blasted a number of entrances to Mammoth Cave on land not owned by the Croghan Estate. Absent the data from the Croghan's secretive surveys, performed by Kaemper, Bishop, and others, which had not been published in a form suitable for determining the geographic extent of the cave, it was now conclusively shown that the Croghans had been for years exhibiting portions of Mammoth Cave which were not under land they owned. Lawsuits were filed and for a time, different entrances to the cave were operated in direct competition with each other.

In the early 20th century, [[Floyd Collins]] spent ten years exploring the Flint Ridge Cave System (the most important legacy of these explorations was the discovery of Floyd Collins' Crystal Cave and exploration in Salts cave) before dying at Sand Cave, Kentucky, in 1925. While exploring Sand Cave, he dislodged a rock onto his leg while in a tight crawlway and was unable to free himself.<ref>Brucker and Murray 1983</ref> Attempts to rescue Collins created a media sensation.

===The National Park Movement (1926–1941)===
[[Image:Mammoth Cave National Park path.png|thumb|Trails wind through the park.]]
[[Image:Mammoth cave.JPG|thumb|250px|Visitors on a tour in Mammoth cave.]]
As the last of the Croghan heirs died, advocacy momentum grew among wealthy citizens of Kentucky for the establishment of Mammoth Cave National Park. Private citizens formed the Mammoth Cave National Park Association in 1926. The Park was authorized [[May 25]], [[1926]].

Donated funds were used to purchase some farmsteads in the region, while other tracts within the proposed National Park boundary were acquired by right of [[eminent domain]]. In contrast to the formation of other National Parks in the sparsely populated American West, thousands of people would be forcibly relocated in the process of forming Mammoth Cave National Park. Often eminent domain proceedings were bitter, with landowners paid what was considered to be inadequate sums. The resulting acrimony still resonates within the region.

For legal reasons, the federal government was prohibited from restoring or developing the cleared farmsteads while the private Association held the land: this regulation was evaded by the operation of "a maximum of four" [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] camps from [[May 22]], [[1933]] to July 1942.<ref>Bridwell 1952, p. 60.</ref><ref>[http://www.wku.edu/Library/nps/ccc/index.html Civilian Conservation Corps at Mammoth Cave National Park]</ref>

According to the National Park Service,<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/tolson/histlist7m.htm National Park Service: Historic Listings of NPS Officials]</ref> "On [[May 14]], [[1934]] the minimum park area was provided. On [[May 22]], [[1936]], the minimum area was accepted for administration and protection." 

Superintendent Hoskins later wrote of a [[summer tanager]] named Pete who arrived at the guide house on or around every [[April 20]], starting in 1938. The bird ate from food held in the hands of the guides, to the delight of visitors, and provided food to his less-tame mate.<ref>Hoskins 1941</ref>

===Birth of the National Park (1941)===
Mammoth Cave National Park was officially dedicated on [[July 1]], [[1941]]. By coincidence, the same year saw the incorporation of the [[National Speleological Society]]. R. Taylor Hoskins, the second Acting Superintendent under the old Association, became the first official Superintendent, a position he held until 1951.

The New Entrance, closed to visitors since 1941, was reopened on [[December 26]], [[1951]], becoming the entrance used for the beginning of the Frozen Niagara tour.<ref>Bridwell 1952, p. 60</ref>

==="The Longest Cave" (1954–1972)===
[[Image:Mammoth_Cave_Mammoth_Dome.jpg|thumb|Staircase tower in mammoth Dome]]

By 1954, Mammoth Cave National Park's land holdings encompassed all lands within its outer boundary with the exception of two privately held tracts. One of these, the old Lee Collins farm, had been sold to Harry Thomas of Horse Cave Kentucky, whose grandson, William "Bill" Austin, operated Collins Crystal Cave as a show cave in direct competition with the National Park, which was forced to maintain roads leading to the property. Condemnation and purchase of the Crystal Cave property seemed only a matter of time. 

In February 1954, a two-week expedition under the auspices of the [[National Speleological Society]] was organized at the invitation of Austin: this expedition became known as C-3, or the "Collins Crystal Cave" expedition.<ref>Lawrence and Brucker 1955</ref>

The C-3 expedition drew public interest, first from a photo essay published by [[Robert Halmi]] (in either ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' or ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine) and later from the publication of a double first-person account of the expedition, ''The Caves Beyond: The Story of the Collins Crystal Cave Expedition'' by Joe Lawrence, Jr. (then president of the National Speleological Society) and Roger W. Brucker. The expedition proved conclusively that passages in Crystal Cave extended toward Mammoth Cave proper, at least exceeding the Crystal Cave property boundaries. However, this information was closely held by the explorers: it was feared that the National Park Service might forbid exploration were this known.<ref>Brucker and Watson 1976 p. 31</ref>

In 1955 Crystal cave was connected with Unknown cave, the first connection in the Flint Ridge system.

Some of the participants in the C3 expedition wished to continue their explorations past the conclusion of the C-3 Expedition, and organized as the Flint Ridge Reconnaissance under the guidance of Austin, Jim Dyer, John J. Lehrberger and Dr. E. Robert Pohl. This organization was incorporated in 1957 as the [[Cave Research Foundation]], Inc. The organization sought to legitimize the cave explorers' activity through the support of original academic and scientific research. Notable scientists who studied Mammoth Cave during this period include [[Patty Jo Watson]] (see section on [[#Prehistory|prehistory]].)

Colossal Cave was connected to Salts Cave in 1960 and in 1961 all the cave entrances in the Flint Ridge system were connected.

In March 1961, the Crystal Cave property was eventually sold to the National Park Service for a sum of [[USD]] $285,000.<ref>Bridwell 1952, p. 59.</ref> At the same time, the Great Onyx Cave property, the only other remaining private [[inholding]], was purchased for [[USD]] $365,000. The Cave Research Foundation was permitted to continue their exploration through a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Park Service.

===Flint–Mammoth Connection (1972)===
[[Image:River Styx.jpg|thumb|300px|River Styx, one of the cave's semi-subterranean waterways, emerges onto the surface in the park.]]
On [[September 9]], [[1972]], a [[Cave Research Foundation]] mapping team led by Dr. John P. Wilcox, [[Patricia Crowther]], Richard B. Zopf, Dr. P. Gary Eller, Stephen G. Wells, and Cleveland F. Pinnix (a National Park Service Ranger) managed to pursue a low, wet passage that linked two of the area's long cave systems—Flint Ridge Cave System to Mammoth Cave. This connection made the combined Flint–Mammoth Cave System the world's longest. (Flint Ridge had itself recently surpassed [[Hölloch Cave]], in [[Switzerland]], as the world's longest cave.)

On a previous trip deep in the Flint Ridge Cave System, Patricia Crowther—with her slight frame of 115 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (52 [[kilogram]]s)—crawled through a narrow canyon later dubbed the "Tight Spot", which acted as a filter for larger cavers.

A subsequent trip fielded past the Tight Spot by Crowther, Wilcox, Zopf, and Tom Brucker found the name "Pete H" inscribed on the wall with an arrow pointing in the direction of Mammoth Cave.<ref>Brucker and Watson 1976, p. 208.</ref> The name is believed to have been carved by Pete Hanson, who was active in exploring the cave in the 1930s. Hanson was killed in [[World War II]]. The passage was named Hanson's Lost River.

On the [[September 9]] trip, following Hanson's Lost River led the six-person team to Cascade Hall in Mammoth Cave, final proof that the caves were connected. John Wilcox emerged in waist deep water to see a regular horizontal line across his field of vision, which proved to be a tourist handrail: the "[[Apollo 11|One small step for a man]]" quote for "conquering the [[Mount Everest|Everest]] of [[speleology]]" was his exclamation to the others "I see a tourist trail!" Of all of the many miles of Mammoth Cave, only a small fraction is developed with trails and lighting, so it was remarkable that the moment of connection took place in an utterly familiar setting.

===Recent discoveries===
Further connections between Mammoth Cave and smaller caves or cave systems have followed, notably to Proctor/Morrison Cave (Proctor cave was discovered by Jonathan Doyle, a Union army deserter during the Civil war and was latter owned by the Mammoth cave railroad, before being explored by the CRF, whereas Morrison cave was discovered by George Morrison in the 1920s) beneath nearby Joppa Ridge in 1979. This connection pushed the frontier of Mammoth exploration southeastward. 

At the same time, discoveries made outside the Park by an independent group called the Central Kentucky Karst Coalition or CKKC resulted in the survey of tens of miles in Roppel Cave east of the Park. On [[September 10]], [[1983]], a connection was made between the Proctor/Morrison's section of the Mammoth Cave system and Roppel Cave (discovered in 1976 by Jerry Roppel, Jim Currens and James Borden.) The connection was made by two mixed parties of CRF and CKKC explorers. Each party entered through a separate entrance and met in the middle before continuing in the same direction to exit at the opposite entrance. The resulting total surveyed length was near 300 miles. Incremental discoveries since then have pushed the total to more than 367 miles.

In early 2005 a connection into the Roppel Cave portion of the system was surveyed from a small cave under Eudora Ridge (originally discovered and entered in 2003 by CRF/CKKC personnel.)

It is accepted with certainty that many more miles of cave passages await discovery in the region. Scientists believe that there are thousands of species of animals yet undiscovered in the [[cave]] system.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Common misconceptions==
The superlatives which are justly applied to Mammoth Cave often lead to exaggeration of the cave's extent and reach. One such misconception is that the cave extends far beyond its geographical boundaries, even to other states in the United States. This misconception is easily debunked. Caves of Mammoth's type form as water from the surface seeks the level of the surface streams which drain them: in Mammoth Cave's case, the [[Green River (Kentucky)|Green River]] to the north. It is a virtual certainty that no cave passages connecting to Mammoth will ever be found north of the Green River, or substantially east of the Sinkhole Plain which is the primary recharge area (the place where water enters) for the cave. More tantalizing is the prospect of ancient passages to the south which might bridge the current drainage divide between the Green River basin and the [[Barren River Lake|Barren River]] basin south of it, but in that case, the maximum expected southerly extent of Mammoth Cave would be the Barren River.

It is true, however, that the layers of [[sedimentary]] rock in which Mammoth Cave has formed do extend many miles in almost any direction from Mammoth Cave. These rocks were all laid down over the same period. The similarity of the rocks of the broader region to those in the immediate vicinity of Mammoth Cave means that conditions are right for cave formation; however, the absolute boundaries of the Mammoth Cave system are known, so it is expected that these other caves will not be found to connect to Mammoth Cave.

==Other notes==
*The cave is linked with [[computer game]]s (see [[interactive fiction]]); one of the earliest such games, [[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]], is based on parts of the cave system (the Colossal section and the Bedquilt Entrance). The author of the game, [[Will Crowther]], was married to noted caver [[Pat Crowther]].

*Mammoth Cave is the setting of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[1905]] [[short story]], "[[The Beast in the Cave]]".

*Mammoth Cave is also the setting of [[Alexander C. Irvine]]'s [[2002]] [[novel]], "A Scattering of Jades", a novel that can be read as fantasy or alternate history, winning the [[Locus Award]] and [[International Horror Guild Award]] among others.

*Two other massive cave systems lie short distances from Mammoth Cave: the [[Fisher Ridge Cave System]] and the [[Martin Ridge Cave System]]. The Fisher Ridge Cave System was discovered in January 1981 by a group of Michigan cavers [http://home.flash.net/~mfitch/history.html]. So far, the cave has been mapped to 110 miles / 177 kilometers (Gulden, B. 2007). In 1996, [[Martin Ridge Cave System|Martin Ridge Cave]] was discovered by [[John Alan Glennon]] and Jonathan David Jasper. Connections discovered by [[John Alan Glennon|Glennon]] and Jasper to nearby Whigpistle and Jackpot Caves resulted in the 32 mile / 51 kilometer-long [[Martin Ridge Cave System]] [http://www.alanglennon.com/martin/].

*If connections are found between the three giant caves&mdash;[[Fisher Ridge Cave System]], [[Martin Ridge Cave System]] and Mammoth Cave&mdash;the total mapped system would exceed 500 miles / 800 kilometers (Gulden, B. 2005).

*Mammoth Cave is a purported entrance to the inner Earth spoken of by some indigenous cultures' spiritual elders. [[Agartha]]. See [[Hollow Earth|hollow earth theory]] for more on this theory.

===Brucker Series===
Roger W. Brucker [http://www.rogerbrucker.com]has co-authored four books on the history and exploration of the Mammoth Cave System. They are presented here not in the order of publication, but in the order in which the events of the books' major narratives took place:

*Brucker, Roger W. and Murray, Robert K. (Brucker and Murray 1983) ''Trapped: The Story of Floyd Collins.'' University of Kentucky Press. Told by a scholar of early 20th century journalism and a veteran of the modern period of Mammoth Cave exploration, this book details the events of the entrapment and attempted rescue of [[Floyd Collins]], who was trapped in a cave near Mammoth Cave in January 1925.
*Lawrence, Jr, Joe and Brucker, Roger W. (Lawrence and Brucker 1955) ''The Caves Beyond: The story of the Floyd Collins' Crystal Cave Expedition'' New York: Funk and Wagnell's. Reprinted, with new introduction, by Zephyrus Press ISBN 0-914264-18-4 (pbk.) Details the story of the 1954 week-long C3 expedition from the separate points of view of the leader and an ordinary participant in the expedition, who went on to become one of the leaders of the then-nascent modern period of exploration.
*Brucker, Roger W. and Watson, Richard A. "Red" (Brucker and Watson 1976) ''The Longest Cave.'' New York : Knopf (reprinted [[1987]], with afterword: Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press) ISBN 0-8093-1322-7 (pbk.) A comprehensive story of the exploration of Mammoth Cave told by two of the founders of the [[Cave Research Foundation]]. An invaluable appendix, "Historical Beginnings", outlines the story of the cave from prehistory to the mid 1950s, where the main narrative begins. The formation of the Cave Research Foundation is described from an insider perspective. A highly personal telling, this work is sometimes jokingly or with irony referred to by cavers as ''Roger and Red Go Caving'', though its revered status in the literature and the reputations of the authors are hardly in doubt. The 1989 reprint includes an Afterword by the authors referring to the 1983 Roppel-Mammoth connection and other subsequent events.
*Borden, James D. and Brucker, Roger W. (Borden and Brucker 2000) ''Beyond Mammoth Cave: A Tale of Obsession in the World's Longest Cave.'' Carbondale and Edwardsville, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press. ISBN 0-8093-2346-X. Taking up where ''The Longest Cave'' leaves off, carries the story of Mammoth Cave Exploration from [[September 10]], [[1972]] to [[September 10]], [[1983]], when a connection was surveyed between [[Roppel Cave]] and the southern reaches of Mammoth Cave.  Details the origins of the Central Kentucky Karst Coalition (CKKC).

These and many other questions are answered in this book about America's most popular cave." Written for the lay reader, but with much technical information of interest to those with greater scientific literacy, by a retired professor of geology at [[SUNY Oneonta]].
