'''USS ''Moffett'' (DD-362)''' was a [[Porter class destroyer|''Porter''-class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]]. She was named for [[William Moffett]].

''Moffett'' was laid down [[2 January]] [[1934]] by [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation]], [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]; launched [[11 December]] [[1935]]; sponsored by Miss Beverly Moffett, daughter of Rear Admiral Moffett; and commissioned at [[Boston, Massachusetts]] [[28 August]] [[1936]], Commander [[Andrew H. Addoms]] in command.

''Moffett'' left [[Newport, Rhode Island]], her base for [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]] operations between 1936 and 1941, on [[24 April]] [[1941]], joining the South Atlantic [[Neutrality Patrol]] off [[Brazil]]. After the fall of [[France]], she operated out of [[Puerto Rico]] with a force guarding against hostile action by a [[Vichy]]-inclined admiral commanding the [[French West Indies]] fleet based at [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. She left her South Atlantic duty in August 1941 to protect [[USS Augusta (CA-31)|''Augusta'']], which was carrying [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to the [[Atlantic Charter]] Conference with [[British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] at [[Naval Station Argentia|NS Argentia]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. 

For the first 2 years of [[World War II]], ''Moffett'' operated with typical destroyer versatility on patrol and convoy duties in the South Atlantic and [[Caribbean]], escort missions bringing her to U.S. ports from time to time. She made several voyages to west [[Africa]]n parts in 1943. On [[17 May]] [[1943]], as she and [[USS Jouett (DD-396)|''Jouett'']] were on escort duty in the Caribbean, she learned that patrol planes had spotted and fired upon a [[Germany|German]] [[submarine]]. At 1246, ''Moffett'' sighted the German submarine [[Unterseeboot 128|U-128]]. The two destroyers sank the submarine with 5 inch gunfire, then rescued 50 survivors including the German commanding officer.

Three months later, while escorting [[USS Memphis (CL-13)|''Memphis'']] and a merchant ship to [[Ascension Island]], ''Moffett'' made contact with [[Unterseeboot 604|U-604]], and again joined Navy aircraft to attack. A running fight ensued through the night, and when the submarine surfaced 95 miles north of [[Trinidad]] next morning, ''Moffett'' drove her down once more with five hits. Three days later, with the aid of aircraft, contact was regained and the submarine was badly damaged by ''Moffett's'' depth charges. In the dark and confusion of action, a friendly aircraft mistaking ''Moffett'' for the enemy made two strafing runs which caused minor damage. The stricken submarine was finally scuttled by her crew [[11 August]]; ''Moffett'' was credited with the kill.

On [[26 March]] [[1944]], ''Moffett'' sailed as escort commander of Convoy YN-78, a group of tugs, barges, and patrol craft en route to [[England]] for the invasion of [[Normandy]]. After visiting [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], ''Moffett'' returned to New York [[11 May]].

''Moffett's'' last combat experience came [[1 August]], when enemy planes attacked Convoy UGS-48 as she screened it en route [[Bizerte]]. Laying smoke to protect the convoy, ''Moffett'' went into a series of brilliant tight turns and maneuvers to dodge the torpedo planes which continued to attack through the night, and with other escorts drove them off with antiaircraft fire. She returned to [[New York]] from this mission [[27 August]]. After a last escort voyage to Oran in April 1945, ''Moffett'' began extended repairs at Boston.

Towed to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], [[28 May]] for further repairs, ''Moffett'' was still in the yard at the close of the war in August, and work was stopped. 

She was decommissioned in Charleston [[2 November]] [[1945]] and entered the Reserve Fleet. Stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]] [[28 January]] [[1947]], ''Moffett'' was sold for scrapping [[16 May]] [[1947]] to [[Boston Metals Company]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

''Moffett'' received 2 [[battle star]]s for World War II service.

As of 2005, no other United States Navy ship has been named ''Moffett''.
