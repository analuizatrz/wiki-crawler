'''Dachau''' was a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[concentration camp]] located on the grounds of an abandoned munitions factory near the medieval town of [[Dachau]], about 10 miles northwest of [[Munich]] in southern Germany. Opened on [[22 March]] [[1933]], the Dachau concentration camp was the first regular concentration camp established by the National Socialist (Nazi) government. [[Heinrich Himmler]], in his capacity as police president of [[Munich]], officially described the camp as "the first concentration camp for [[political prisoner]]s."<ref>http://www.mazal.org/archive/DACHPHO/Dach02.htm Translation: The Munich Chief of Police, Himmler, has issued the following press announcement: On Wednesday the first concentration camp is to be opened in Dachau with an accommodation for 5000 persons. ''All Communists and—where necessary—Reichsbanner and Social Democratic functionaries who endanger state security are to be concentrated here, as in the long run it is not possible to keep individual functionaries in the state prisons without overburdening these prisons, and on the other hand these people cannot be released because attempts have shown that they persist in their efforts to agitate and organise as soon as they are released.''</ref>

Dachau served as a [[prototype]] and model for the other [[Nazi concentration camp]]s that followed. Its basic organization, camp layout as well as the plan for the buildings were developed by [[Commandant|Kommandant]] [[Theodor Eicke]] and were applied to all later camps. He had a separate secure camp near the command center, which consisted of living quarters, administration, and army camps. Eicke himself became the chief inspector for all concentration camps, responsible for molding the others according to his model.<ref>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. "The Holocaust." Holocaust Encyclopedia. http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005214</ref>

In total, over 200,000 prisoners from more than 30 countries were housed in Dachau of which nearly one-third were [[Jews]].[http://www.fatherryan.org/holocaust/dachau/subindex.htm] 32,099 prisoners are believed to have died in the camp and almost another 10,000 in its subcamps[That Was Dachau 1933 - 1945 by Stanislav Zámečník Page 377 and 379], primarily from [[disease]], [[malnutrition]] and [[suicide]]. In early [[1945]], there was a [[typhus]] [[epidemic]] in the camp followed by an evacuation, in which large numbers of the weaker prisoners died.

Together with the much larger [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], Dachau has come to symbolize the Nazi concentration camps to many people. KZ Dachau holds a significant place in public memory because it was the second camp to be liberated by [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[United States|American]] forces. Therefore, it was one of the first places in which the [[Western world|West]] was exposed to the reality of [[Nazism|Nazi]] brutality through firsthand [[journalist]] accounts and through [[newsreel]]s.<ref>Among the most famous inmates of the Dachau concentration camp were [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Litten Hans Litten], Fred Rabinowitz (a.k.a. Fred Roberts), [[Stefan Starzynski]], the composer [[Blaž Arnič]] and Alfred Gruenebaum, the father of a prominent [[US]] [[obstetrician]], [[Amos Grunebaum]].</ref>

The camp was divided into two sections—the camp area and the crematorium. The camp area consisted of 32 barracks, including one for clergy imprisoned for opposing the Nazi regime and one reserved for medical experiments. The courtyard between the prison and the central kitchen was used for the summary execution of prisoners. An electrified barbed-wire fence, a ditch, and a wall with seven guard towers surrounded the camp.<ref>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. "The Holocaust." Holocaust Encyclopedia. http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005214</ref>

In early 1937, the SS, using prisoner labor, initiated construction of a large complex of buildings on the grounds of the original camp. Prisoners were forced to do this work, starting with the destruction of the old munitions factory, under terrible conditions. The construction was officially completed in mid-August 1938 and the camp remained essentially unchanged and in operation until 1945. Dachau thus was the longest running concentration camp of the Third Reich. The area in Dachau included other SS facilities beside the concentration camp—a leader school of the economic and civil service, the medical school of the SS, etc. The KZ at that time was called a "protective custody camp," and occupied less than half of the area of the entire complex.

Dachau also served as the central camp for [[Christian]] religious prisoners. According to records of the [[Roman Catholic]] Church, at least 3000 [[religious]], [[deacon]]s, [[priest]]s, and [[bishop]]s were imprisoned there.<ref>Particularly notable among the Christian residents are [[Karl Leisner]] (Catholic priest ordained while in the camp, [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[1996]]) and [[Martin Niemöller]] ([[Protestant]] theologian and Nazi resistance leader).</ref>

In August [[1944]] a women's camp opened inside Dachau. Its first shipment of women came from Auschwitz Birkenau. Only nineteen [[Female Guards in Nazi Concentration Camps|women guards]] served at Dachau, most of them until liberation.<ref>''THE CAMP WOMEN, The Female Auxiliaries who Assisted the SS in Running the Nazi Concentration Camp System'' by Daniel Patrick Brown.</ref> <ref>Sources show the names of sixteen of the nineteen women guarding the camp; [[Fanny Baur]], Leopoldine Bittermann, [[Ernestine Brenner]], [[Anna Buck]], [[Rosa Dolaschko]], [[Maria Eder]], [[Rosa Grassmann]], [[Betty Hanneschaleger]], [[Ruth Elfriede Hildner]], [[Josefa Keller]], [[Berta Kimplinger]], [[Lieselotte Klaudat]], Theresia Kopp, [[Rosalie Leimboeck]], and [[Thea Miesl]]. Women guards were also staffed at the Augsburg Michelwerke, Burgau, Kaufering, Muhldorf, and Munich Agfa Camera Werke subcamps. In mid-April 1945 many female subcamps at [[Kaufering]], [[Augsburg]] and [[Munich]] closed, and the SS women stationed at Dachau. It is reported that female SS guards gave prisoners guns before liberation to save them from postwar prosecution.</ref>

In the last war months the conditions at Dachau became even worse. As Allied forces advanced toward Germany, the Germans began to move prisoners in concentration camps near the front to camps further inward. They hoped to prevent the liberation of large numbers of prisoners. Transports from the evacuated camps arrived continuously at Dachau. After days of travel, with little or no food or water, the prisoners arrived weak and exhausted, often near death. Typhus epidemics became a serious problem due to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, insufficient provisions, and the weakened state of the prisoners.

Due to continual new transportations from the front the camp was constantly overcrowded, the hygienic conditions were beneath human dignity. Starting from the end of 1944 up to the day of liberation 15,000 people died, about half of all victims in KZ Dachau.

On April 27, 1945, Victor Mauer, delegate of the International Committee of the [[Red Cross]], was allowed to enter camps and distribute food. In the evening of the same day a prisoner transport arrived from [[Buchenwald]]. Only 800 survivors were brought from originally 4,480 to 4,800 persons in transit. Over 2,300 corpses were let lie in and around the train. The last regular commander of the KZ, [[Obersturmbannführer]] Eduard Weiter, had already fled on 26 April. He probably followed Obersturmbannführer Martin Weiss, who had led the camp from September 1942 until November 1943.

On April 28, 1945, the day before the surrender, Camp Commandant Martin Weiss had left the Dachau camp, along with most of the regular guards and administrators in the camp. On that same day, Victor Maurer, a representative of the Red Cross, had tried to persuade 1st Lt. Johannes Otto, the adjutant of Commandant Weiss, not to abandon the camp, but to leave guards posted to keep the prisoners inside until the Americans arrived. Mauer feared that the prisoners would escape ''en masse'' and spread the active typhus fever epidemic. Lt. Otto declined to remain and fled.

==Liberation of the camp==
[[Image:Dead corpses in train dachau.jpg|thumb|Corpses lie in one of the open railcars of the Dachau death train]]

On April 29, 1945, the watchtowers of the Dachau camp remained occupied and a white flag was hoisted. Red Cross representative Maurer persuaded SS-[[Untersturmführer]] Heinrich Wicker, an officer in the SS-Totenkopfverbände, to accompany him to the main gate of the Dachau complex to formally surrender the concentration camp.

Late in the afternoon of April 29, 1945, KZ Dachau was surrendered to the American Army by SS-[[Untersturmführer]] Heinrich Wicker.<ref> http://www.scrapbookpages.com/Dachauscrapbook/DachauLiberation/Wicker.html</ref> A vivid description of the surrender appears in Brig. Gen. Henning Linden's official "Report on Surrender of Dachau Concentration Camp":

<blockquote>As we moved down along the west side of the concentration camp and approached the southwest corner, three people approached down the road under a flag of truce. We met these people about 75 yards north of the southwest entrance to the camp. These three people were a Swiss Red Cross representative and two SS troopers who said they were the camp commander and assistant camp commander and that they had come into the camp on the night of the 28th to take over from the regular camp personnel for the purpose of turning the camp over to the advancing Americans. The Swiss Red Cross representative acted as interpreter and stated that there were about 100 SS guards in the camp who had their arms stacked except for the people in the tower. He said he had given instructions that there would be no shots fired and that it would take about 50 men to relieve the guards, as there were 42,000 half-crazed prisoners of war in the camp, many of them typhus infected. He asked if I were an officer of the American army, to which I replied, "Yes, I am Assistant Division Commander of the 42d Division and will accept the surrender of the camp in the name of the Rainbow Division for the American army." </blockquote>
[[Image:Dachau execution coalyard 1945-04-29.jpg|thumb|left|This picture shows an execution of SS troops by American soldiers]]

After the camp was surrendered to [[Allied forces]], the troops were so horrified by conditions at the camp that they summarily shot many of the camp guards in what is called the [[Dachau massacre]]. The exact number killed is in dispute; according to some versions, only 35 Nazi guards were executed this way and the other 515 were presumably either arrested, or managed to escape. The Americans found 32,000 prisoners, crammed 1,600 to each of 20 barracks, which had been designed to house 250 people each. The US troops also found 39 railroad cars, each filled with one hundred or more corpses.

[[Image:Dachau-002edit.jpg|thumb|right|Tablet dedicated to the 42nd Division.]]The camp was freed by the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] of the [[U.S. Seventh Army]] on [[April 29]], [[1945]] after coming across this camp, not knowing its location nor its existence. These forces were led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Felix L. Sparks]] who, under orders to permit no one in or out, refused entry to a [[brigadier general]] from another unit. Court-martial charges were drawn up, and Sparks was arrested; the charges were dismissed by [[George S. Patton|General Patton]]. (Sparks was actually with the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th Infantry Division. There is an on-going "disagreement" as to which unit, the 42nd or the 45th, was actually first into Dachau.) Patton was reportedly so shocked at the conditions at the camp that upon seeing it for himself he vomited.

The U.S. troops also forced citizens of the local community to come to the camp, observe the conditions, and help clean the facilities. The local residents were indignant at being treated this way and claimed no knowledge of the activities of the camp.

==Post-liberation Easter at Dachau==
[[Image:Prisoners liberation dachau.jpg|thumb|left|Liberated Dachau camp prisoners cheer U.S. troops]]

A few days after the liberation of the camp was the day of [[Pascha]], Orthodox Easter. In a cell block used by Catholic priests to say daily mass, several [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Serbia]]n, and [[Russia]]n priests and one Serbian deacon, wearing makeshift vestments made from towels of the SS guard, gathered with several hundred Greek, Serbian and Russian prisoners to celebrate the Paschal Matins and Liturgy. A prisoner named Rahr described the scene: 

<blockquote>''In the entire history of the [[Orthodox Church]] there has probably never been an Easter service like the one at Dachau in 1945. Greek and Serbian priests together with a Serbian deacon adorned the make-shift 'vestments' over their blue and gray-striped prisoners' uniforms. Then they began to chant, changing from Greek to Slavonic, and then back again to Greek. The Easter Canon, the Easter Sticheras—everything was recited from memory. The Gospel—'In the beginning was the Word'—also from memory. And finally, the Homily of Saint John—also from memory. A young Greek [[monk]] from the Holy Mountain stood up in front of us and recited it with such infectious enthusiasm that we shall never forget him as long as we live. Saint John Chrysostomos himself seemed to speak through him to us and to the rest of the world as well!''</blockquote>
[[Image:Survivors liberation dachau.jpg|thumb|200px|Crowd of cheering survivors]]

There is a Russian Orthodox chapel at the camp today, and it is well known for its exquisite icon of Christ leading the prisoners out of the camp gates.

The U.S. 7th Army's version of the events of the Dachau Liberation are available in ''Report of Operations of the Seventh United States Army,'' Vol. 3, page 382.

==After liberation==
After liberation, the camp was used by the [[United States Army|US Army]] as an [[internment]] camp. In 1948 the [[Bavaria]]n government established housing for [[refugee]]s on the site, and this remained for many years.<ref>[http://www.gedenkstaettenpaedagogik-bayern.de/ausstellungstexte.htm Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site (pedagogical information)] {{De icon}}</ref>

==The memorial site==
[[Image:Dachau-015.jpg|thumb|right|The commemorative mass grave dedicated to the unknown dead at Dachau]] [[Image:Dachau_never_again.jpg|thumb|left|"Never again" written in several languages]]

Years later, former prisoners banded together to erect a [[memorial]] on the site of the camp, finding it unbelievable that there were still persons (refugees) living in the camp under those conditions.

The display, which was reworked in [[2003]], takes the visitor through the path of new arrivals to the camp. Special presentations of some of the notable prisoners are also provided. Two of the [[barracks]] have been rebuilt and one shows a cross-section of the entire history of the camp, since the original barracks had to be torn down due to their poor condition when the memorial was built. The other 28 barracks are indicated by concrete foundations.

The memorial includes four chapels for the various religions represented among the prisoners.

The local government resisted designating the complete site a memorial. The former SS barracks adjacent to the camp are now occupied by the Bavarian [[Bereitschaftspolizei]] (rapid response police unit).<ref>{{
