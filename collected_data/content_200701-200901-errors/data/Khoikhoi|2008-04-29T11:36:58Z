The '''Khoikhoi''' ('People People', less accurately 'men of men'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045325/Khoekhoe |title=Khoekhoe |accessdate=2007-01-15 |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref>) or '''Khoi''', in standardised Khoekhoe/[[Nama language|Nama]] orthography spelled '''Khoekhoe''', are a historical division of the [[Khoisan]] ethnic group of southwestern [[Africa]], closely related to the [[Bushmen]] (or ''San'', as the Khoikhoi called them). They had lived in [[southern Africa]] since the 5th century [[Common Era|AD]]<ref>[http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:JCqxHk9HSUsJ:archive.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/sponsor-child/country_information_on_namibia.html+khoikhoi+arrived&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a Country Information on Namibia] (cached page)</ref> and, at the time of the arrival of white settlers in [[1652]], practised extensive [[pastoralism|pastoral agriculture]] in the Cape region, with large herds of [[Nguni cattle]]. 

Archaeological evidence shows that the Khoikhoi entered [[South Africa]] from [[Botswana]] through two distinct routes – travelling west, skirting the Kalahari to the west coast, then down to the Cape, and travelling south-east out into the [[Highveld]] and then southwards to the south coast.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa-SAColonists1.htm Pre-Colonial cultures in South Africa; The San and Khoikhoi] About.com</ref>  

==Name==
The name Khoekhoe most accurately translates to 'People People'. They were traditionally—and are still occasionally in [[colloquial]] language—known to white colonists as the '''''Hottentots''''', a name that is currently generally considered offensive (e.g. by the [[Oxford Dictionary]] of [[South African English]]). The word "hottentot" meant "stutterer" or "stammerer" in the colonists' northern dialect of [[Dutch language|Dutch]],<ref>[http://courses.wcupa.edu/wanko/LIT400/Africa/hottentotinfo.htm The Hottentots. British Views Of 18th Century Africa.] Retrieved on: [[February 01]] [[2008]]</ref> although some Dutch use the verb ''stotteren'' to describe the [[click consonant|clicking sounds]] (''klik'' being the normal [[onomatopoeia]], parallel to English) typically used in the [[Khoisan languages]]. The word lives on, however, in the names of several African animal and plant species, such as the [[Ice Plant|Hottentot Fig]] or Ice Plant (''Carpobrotus edulis'').

==History==
The Khoikhoi were originally part of a pastoral culture and language group found across Southern Africa.  Originated in the northern area of modern [[Botswana]], the ethnic group steadily migrated south, reaching the Cape approximately 2,000 years ago.  Khoikhoi subgroups include the Korana of mid-South Africa, the [[Namaqua]] to the west, and the Khoikhoi in the south.  Husbandry of sheep, goats and cattle provided a stable, balanced diet and allowed the related Khoikhoi peoples to live in larger groups than the region's original inhabitants, the [[Bushmen|San]]. Herds grazed in fertile valleys across the region until the 3rd century AD when the advancing [[Bantu]] encroached into their traditional homeland.  The Khoikhoi were forced into a long retreat into more arid areas.

Migratory Khoi bands living around what is today [[Cape Town, South Africa]], intermarried with San.  However the two groups remained culturally distinct as the Khoikhoi continued to graze livestock and the San subsisted as hunter-gatherers.  The Khoi initially came into contact with European explorers and merchants in approximately AD 1500.  The ongoing encounters were often violent, although the British made some attempt to develop more amiable relationships.  Local population dropped when the Khoi were exposed to smallpox by Europeans.  Active warfare between the groups flared when the [[Dutch East India Company]] enclosed traditional grazing land for farms.  Over the following century the Khoi were steadily driven off their land, which effectively ended traditional Khoikhoi life.

Khoikhoi social organisation was profoundly damaged and, in the end, destroyed by white colonial expansion and land seizure from the late 17th century onwards. As social structures broke down, some Khoikhoi people settled on farms and became bondsmen or farmworkers; others were incorporated into existing clan and family groups of the [[Xhosa]] people.

==Culture==
The [[Khoikhoi mythology|religious mythology of the Khoikhoi]] gives special significance to the [[moon]], which may have been viewed as the physical manifestation of a supreme being associated with heaven. [[Khoikhoi mythology#Tsui/Tsui'goab|Tsui'goab]] is also believed to be the creator and the guardian of health, while Gunab is primarily an evil being, who causes sickness or death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://khoisan.org/religion.htm |title=Reconstructing the Past - the Khoikhoi: Religion and Nature}}</ref> Recently, many Khoikhoi in [[Namibia]] have converted to [[Islam]] and make up the largest group among [[Islam in Namibia|Namibia's  Muslim community]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Rodrick |last=Mukumbira |title=Islam in Namibia…Making an Impact |url=http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2006-06/01/02.shtml |work=[[IslamOnline.net]] |date=[[June 1]], [[2006]]}}</ref>

==Trivia==
In [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'', Dr. [[James Mortimer]] tells [[Sherlock Holmes]], "Many a charming evening we [Charles Baskerville and James] have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot."
