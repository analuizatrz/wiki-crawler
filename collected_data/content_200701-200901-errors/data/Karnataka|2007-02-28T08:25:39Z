'''Karnātakā''' {{audio|Karnataka.ogg|pronunciation}} ([[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ಕನಾ೯ಟಕ) ({{IPA2|kəɹnɑːʈəkɑː}}) is one of the four [[South India|southern]] [[States and territories of India|state]]s of [[India]]. The modern state of Karnataka came into existence with the passage of the ''[[States Reorganisation Act]]'' (1956), with the incorporation of districts under the dominion of [[Bombay (state)|Bombay]], [[Hyderabad (state)|Hyderabad]], [[Madras State]] and [[Coorg]] within the existing state of [[Mysore State]]. 

Karnataka's capital, [[Bengaluru]]/[[Bangalore]], is the capital city of the state with a population of more than 6 million. Other major cities include [[Mysore]], [[Mangalore]], [[Hubli-Dharwad]], [[Davanagere]], [[Bellary]], [[Hassan]], [[Shimoga]] and [[Belgaum]]. [[Kannada]] is the official language of the state. Karnataka is the [[List of states of India by area|8th largest Indian state by area]] and [[List of states of India by population|9th largest by population]].

[[Neolithic]] habitation and [[celt (tool)|celt]]s dating back to the 2nd century [[Before Common Era|BCE]] were first discovered in Karnataka in 1872. [[Megalithic]] structures and burial grounds were discovered in 1862 in the regions of [[Kodagu]] and [[Moorey Betta]] hills. By the third century BCE, most of Karnataka was part of the [[Mauryan Empire]], ruled by [[Ashoka|Emperor Ashoka]]. In the first [[millennium]] [[Common Era|CE]], Karnataka was ruled by a series of [[Jain]]/[[Vaishnavite]]/[[Hindu]] Dynasties such as the [[Kadambas]], the [[Ganga Dynasty]] and the [[Chalukya]]s and [[Rashtrakutas]]. The Kannada Empire was expanded and consolidated by the [[Hoysala Empire]] and further by the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], before the [[Mughal|Mughal Conquest]] in the 18th century. 

The rule of the state changed hands from the [[Wodeyar]]s to [[Haidar Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] before being incorporated into the [[British Raj]], at the turn of the 19th century. Karnataka lies in the [[Deccan Plateau]] and borders with [[Maharashtra]], [[Goa]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]].  

A large proportion of Karnataka's economy, India's fifth largest, is [[agrarian]]. Bangalore, the [[List of most populous cities in India|third-most populous city in India]], accounts for 35% of India's [[software]] exports, and is also a major base for [[public sector]] [[manufacturing]] industries. Karnataka is the only exporter of [[sandalwood]] in India. Bangalore also has the most amount of tourism of the region. [[Kolar Gold Fields]] (KGF) was once the only producer of gold in the country. The gold mines in KGF are now closed.

== Origin of name ==
Several [[etymology|etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka. One accepted derivative comes from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''nādu'' meaning ''elevated land''. During the [[British Raj]], the words ''Carnatic'' or ''Karnatak'' were used to describe this part of the region in general. Another etymological derivative of the name comes from ''lear'' or ''black'' &mdash; a reference to the [[black soil|black cotton soil]] of the region.<ref>http://19.1911encyclopedia.org/C/CA/CARNATIC.htm</ref> Historically, the names ''Karnatak'' or ''Carnatic'' have been misapplied to refer to the regions below the [[Western Ghats]] ([[Coorg]] and [[Kerala]]) as well as regions in present day [[Andhra Pradesh]] ([[Telingana]]).<ref>http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V09_308.gif</ref> Mysore state was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973.

===References from Hindu texts===
The earliest known references to ''Karnataka'' are found in the ''Sabha Parva'' and the ''Bhishma Parva'' of the Mahabharata.  The ''Matsya Purana'', ''Skanda Purana'', ''Markandeya Purana'' and the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' also make references to the name ''Karnata''. 

In Canto 5 - Chapter 6 of the ''Bhagavata Purana'', ''Karnata'' is mentioned while narrating the life of [[Rishabhadeva]].  It is said in the ''Bhagavata'' that the Lord in [[Rishabhadeva]]'s form ended his ''avatara'' in the ''Kutakachala'' hill in ''Karnata'' province.  Kutakchala is a hill in present day Karnataka near [[Kollur]] in the [[Western Ghats]].<ref name="bhagavata1">http://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto5/chapter6.html</ref><ref name="bhagavata2">http://www.vedabase.net/sb/5/6/en1</ref> [[ISKCON]] has also built an ''ashrama'' at the spot.

===Historical references===
Scholars Panini ( 520–460 BCE), Mrichchakatika and Kathasritsagara make references to ''Karnataka'' in their ancient works.  Later, in the 5th century CE. the term ''Karnataka'' is used by the [[astrologer]] [[Varahamihira|Varaha Mihira]] in his work ''Brihatkatha'' and the Birur plates of [[Kadamba]] Vishnuvarma call Shantivarma ''The master of the entire Karnataka region''.<ref>Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, ''Concise history of Karnataka'', 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprinted 2002)</ref> In the 7th century CE. [[Rashtrakuta]] inscriptions refer to the armies of [[Chalukyas]] of Badami as ''Karnatakabala''. The Tamil classic ''Sillapadikaram'' of the same time period calls the people of present day Karnataka region as ''' Karunatakars''. In the 9th century CE. the Kannada classic [[Kavirajamarga]] hails the entire region between Kaveri and Godavari as ''Karnata''.<ref name="Godavari">Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, ''History of South India'', Arthikaje, ''History of Karnataka''</ref> In the 13th century CE. Andayya's works use the same terminology. In the late 16th century, a Telugu work ''Vasucharitamu'' refers to Tirumala Deva Raya (1570 CE), the first of the Aravidu (Aravithi) line of rulers of the late [[Vijayanagar Empire]] as the reviver of the ''Karnata empire''.<ref name="vasucharitamu">Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, ''History of South India'',Archaeological Survey of India, ''Telugu Inscriptions from Vijayanagar Empire [http://inscriptions.whatisindia.com/], vol.16</ref> All this clearly shows that the name ''Karnataka'' has been in usage consistently since ancient times.<ref>Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, Concise history of Karnataka, 2001, MCC, Bengalooru (Reprinted 2002)</ref>

==History== 
[[Image:Belur4.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hoysala Empire]] architecture in [[Belur]].]]
[[Image:GolGumbaz2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gol Gumbaz]] is the mausoleum of Muhammad Adil Shah II (1627-57) of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Indian sultans, who ruled the Sultanate of Bijapur from 1490 to 1686.The structure consists of a massive square chamber measuring nearly 50 m on each side and covered by a huge dome 37.9 m in diameter making it one of the largest domes in the world.]]
Evidence of [[Neolithic]] habitation of areas in modern Karnataka and [[celt (tool)|celt]]s dating back to the 2nd century [[Before Common Era|BCE]] were first discovered in 1872 CE. There are reports that a polished [[stone axe]] was discovered at Lingsugur in the [[Raichur district]]; however the authenticity of these reports remains unverifiable.<ref name="Hindu.com 2005011001090500">http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/10/stories/2005011001090500.htm</ref> [[Megalithic]] structures and burial grounds were discovered in 1862 CE in the regions of [[Kodagu]] and [[Moorey Betta]] hills, while [[Neolithic]] sites were discovered in north Karnataka. Scholarly hypothesis postulates of contacts between the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] city of [[Harappa]] in 3000 BCE, citing the discovery of gold found in the Harappan sites that was imported from mines in Karnataka.<ref name="Hindu.com 2005011001090500"/> In the third century BCE, most of Karnataka was part of the [[Mauryan Empire]], ruled by [[Ashoka|Emperor Ashoka]]. Rock [[edict]]s of Ashoka, written in [[Prakrit]], were discovered in [[Chitradurga]] and Raichur. In the [[4th century BCE]], the [[Satavahana]] dynasty came to power and its rule lasted nearly 3 centuries. The disintegration of the Satavahana dynasty led to the ascent of the first native kingdoms, the [[Banavasi]] [[Kadambas]](325-540 CE) from [[Uttara Kannada]] region, and the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] (325-550 CE) in southern Karnataka. These were the first kingdoms to give administrative status to Kannada language as evidenced by the [[Halmidi inscription]] of 450 CE, attributed to King Kakusthavarma of the Kadamba dynasty. Also, recent discovery of 5th century CE copper coin in [[Banavasi]], ancient capital of the [[Kadambas]], with [[Kannada script]] inscription on it, further proves the usage of Kannada at an official level.<ref>{{cite web

They continued their rule as [[vassal|fiduciaries]] of larger empires such as the [[Chalukya]]s and [[Rashtrakutas]] for another six hundred years, during which time Kannada literature and a new style of architecture called the ''[[vesara]]'' style was born and evolved. Eclectic Chalukyan style temples in [[Pattadakal]], [[Aihole]], [[Badami]], ([[Badami Cave temple]]), [[Ellora]] and [[Gadag]] were conceived during this time. Nripa Kama established the [[Hoysala Empire]] at the turn of the millennium. Art and architecture flourished in the region during the time that resulted in the construction of temples and sculptures  such as the [[Hoysaleswara temple]] in [[Halebid]] and [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur]]. The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought large parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under their rule.<ref name=arbiters">The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] city of Kannanur Kuppam near [[Srirangam]] became the second capital of the Hoysalas during the rule of [[Vira Narasimha II]]. During the time of [[Veera Ballala III]], Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu had been made an alternate capital, from where the Hoysala fought the Sultan of Madurai. The Hoysalas were regarded as practically the arbiters of [[South Indian]] politics. With the waning of Chola and Pandya power, the Hoysalas took up the leadership role in the South India, according to Prof. B.S.K. Iyengar, ''A Concise History of Karnataka'', Dr. S.U. Kamath. The Hoysala rule saw the consolidation and domination of Southern [[Deccan]] as a single empire, Dr. Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India''</ref> In early 14th century, Hosapattana (later to be called [[Vijayanagara]]) on the banks of [[Tungabhadra River]] was built as an alternate capital to stem the Muslim invasions from north. [[Vijayanagar Empire]] was established by Harihara and Bukka Raya, commanders of the last Hoysala King [[Veera Ballala|Veera Ballala III]], with its capital at [[Vijayanagara]], modern day [[Hampi]]. The Vijayanagara Kings fostered traditions and encouraged arts, religion and literature in [[Sanskrit]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. The [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani sultans]] of [[Gulbarga]] and the [[Adil Shahi]] sultans of [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] ruled over the region after the defeat and disintegration of the Vijayanagara Empire in battle. The Bahamani rules encouraged [[Urdu]] and Persian literature and [[Islamic architecture]]. The [[Gol Gumbaz]] was constructed during this time. With the defeat of the Bahmani sultans, the entire region came into the dominion of the [[Mughal Empire]].

[[Image:Mysorepalace.jpg|thumb|250px|Mysore Palace]]The [[Wodeyar]]s of Mysore, former vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire, leased the state from the Mughal king [[Aurangzeb]] in the 15th century CE. With the death of [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar II]], [[Haidar Ali]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Mysore Army, assumed control over the region, until the rule of the kingdom was passed to [[Tippu Sultan]], after Haidar Ali's death. In attempting to contain [[Europe]]an expansion in South India, Tippu Sultan, known as the Tiger of Mysore fought four significant [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]], the last of which resulted in his death and the incorporation of Mysore into the [[British Raj]]. After Indian independence, the [[Wodeyar]] Maharaja acceded to India. In [[1950]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] became an Indian state, and the former Maharaja became its [[Rajpramukh]], head of state, until 1975 CE. The [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956 provided for parts of [[Coorg]], [[Madras State|Madras]], [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], and [[Bombay state]]s to be incorporated into the state of Mysore. Mysore state was renamed Karnataka in 1973.
The state of Mysore was formed on [[November 1]] [[1956]] and since then [[November 1]] of every year is celebrated as [[Kannada Rajyotsava]] / [[Karnataka Rajyotsava]]. 

The impact of kingdoms of Karnataka origin have been felt over most parts of India. The [[Sena Dynasty]] of Bengal called themselves Karnata Kshatriyas, the Karnatas of Mithila, who ruled over the present day Bihar, called themselves Karnata Vamsha and Karnataka Kshatriya.<ref>Thus indicating their Southern origin, Dr. Romila Thapar, The Penguin History of Early India, 2003</ref> The Chindaka Nagas of central India, Gangas of Kalinga (Orissa),<ref>Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, ''Concise history of Karnataka'', 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprinted 2002)</ref> Rashtrakutas of Gujarat<ref>Dr. B.R. Bhandarkar argues that even the viceroys (Dandanayaka) of the Gujarat line hailing from the Rashtrakuta family signed their Sanskrit records in Kannada, examples of which are the Navasari and Baroda plates of Karka I and the Baroda records of Dhruva II. The Gujarat Rashtrakuta princes used Kannada signatures as this was the mode of writing in their native country, meaning Kannada country says Dr. Bhandarkar, "A Concise History of Karnataka", Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath</ref> and Vengi,<ref>Dr. Suryanath Kamath, Prof. K.A.N. Sastri, Arthikaje</ref> Yadava Dynasty of Devagiri were all of Kannada origin<ref>Dr. Ritti has argued thus. Even though the [[Seuna]] or Yadava ruled from Devagiri ([[850]]-[[1315]]), literature in Kannada was prolific in their kingdom along with Sanskrit, coinage with Kannada legends have been discovered and most of their inscriptions are in Kannada, indicating that they were Kannadaigas who migrated north due to political situation. Marathi literature started from around [[1190]], Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, "Concise history of Karnataka", 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprinted 2002)</ref> who later took to encouraging local languages.

==Geography==
[[Image:Flag of Karnataka.svg|thumb|250px|The official flag of Karnataka]]
[[Image:Coraciasbenghalensis.jpg|thumb|250px|The state bird, [[Indian Roller]]]]
Karnataka is situated in the Deccan Plateau and is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the north, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the east and southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the southwest. It is situated at the angle where the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]] of South India converge into the [[Nilgiri|Nilgiri Hill]]s.

The state has three principal physical zones;
* The coastal strip, between the [[Western Ghats]] and the Arabian Sea, which is lowland, with moderate to high rainfall levels. This strip is around 320 km in length and 48-64 km wide.
* The [[Western Ghats]], a mountain range inland from the Arabian Sea, rising to about 900 m average height, and with moderate to high rainfall levels.
* The [[Deccan]] [[Plateau]], comprising the main inland region of the state, which is drier and verging on the semi-arid. The humidity in these plains or maidans never exceeds 50%.

Karnataka has one of the highest average elevations of Indian states at 1,500 feet. The highest recorded temperature was 45.6 C (114.08 F) at [[Raichur]] on May 23, 1928. The lowest recorded temperature was 2.8 C (37.04 F) at [[Bidar]] on December 16, 1918.<ref>{{cite web | title=Karnataka Temperatures | work=Karnataka.com Website | url=http://www.karnataka.com/profile/temperature.shtml | accessmonthday=July 20 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

[[Image:Bangalore_HighCourt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Karnataka High Court]], also called "Attara Kacheri" (which once housed the original "Eighteen Departments"), is the supreme judicial body in Karnataka and is located in Bangalore.]]

===District history===
Karnataka took its present shape in [[1956]], when the states of [[Mysore state|Mysore]] and [[Coorg]] (Kodagu) were merged with the Kannada-speaking districts of the former states of [[Bombay state|Bombay]] and [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], and [[Madras State|Madras]]. Mysore state was made up of ten districts, Bangalore, Kolar, Tumkur, Mandya, Mysore, Hassan, Chikmagalur (Kadur), Shimoga and Chitradurga; [[Bellary]] had been transferred from [[Madras]] state to Mysore in 1953, when the new state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] was created out of Madras' northern districts. Kodagu became a district, and [[Dakshina Kannada]] (South Kanara) district was transferred from Madras state, [[North Kanara]], [[Dharwad]], [[Belgaum District]], and [[Bijapur District]]  from Bombay state, and [[Bidar District]], [[Gulbarga District]], and [[Raichur District]] from Hyderabad state.

In 1989 Bangalore Rural district was split from Bangalore. and in 1997 Bagalkot district split from Bijapur, Chamrajnagar district split from Mysore, Gadag district split from Dharwad, Haveri district split from Dharwad, Koppal district split from Raichur, Udupi district split from Dakshina Kannada, and Davanagere district was created from parts of Bellary, Chitradurga, Dharwad, and Shimoga.

===Politics===
{{Main|Karnataka Politics}}

Karnataka politics is dominated by Congress and Janata Parties (like Janata Dal). Current chief minister is H.D.Kumarasamy, son of former Prime minister H.D.Deve Gowda, from a splinter group of Janata Dal. Bhratiya Janata Party is also part of the government and the deputy chief minister is from this party..

The state has 6 airports in [[Bangalore]], [[Mangalore]], [[Hampi]], [[Hubli]], [[Belgaum]], [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]], and [[Mysore]]. The [[Mysore]] airport is not operational. The [[HAL Airport]] in Bangalore and the [[Mangalore International Airport]] are the only airports currently offering international flights on a regular basis in Karnataka. Currently one international flight operates from [[Mangalore International Airport]] to Dubai. A brand new international airport near Devanahalli, Bangalore is expected to open by April 2008. [[Bangalore International Airport]] Limited (BIAL) is owned by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Larsen & Toubro]], Unique Zurich Airport, KSIIDC and Airport Authority of India. See See [[List of Destinations to/from all Karnataka Airports]] for all the destinations available for flights originating from Karnataka.

===Water transport===
Karnataka has 20 ports, of these [[Mangalore]] and [[Karwar]] are the biggest and most important. The [[New Mangalore port]] is currently the 9th busiest in India in terms of Cargo handled. Karwar is currently set to become the largest naval base in Asia with the completion of [[Project Seabird]] with will result in the naval base [[INS Kadamba]]. The deep water port at INS Kadamba will have more than 50 berths and will be able to accommodate India's aircraft carriers. The port shall also have a new ship lift, the first of its kind in Asia which will enable the navy to repair her ships on land.

===Bus transport===

==Economy==
===Agriculture, industry, and minerals===

'''Agriculture'''

Karnataka is the largest producer of [[coffee]], raw [[silk]] and [[sandalwood]] (''[[Santalum album]]'') based products like perfumes and 75% of Indian [[floriculture]] industry is located in Karnataka. Karnataka accounts for 59% of the country’s [[coffee]] production and 47% of the country’s [[ragi]] production
About 70% of the people live in the villages and 71% of the total work force is engaged in agriculture. The main crops are rice, ragi, jowar, maize, and pulses besides oilseeds and number of cash crops. Cashew, coconut, arecanut, cardamom, chilies, cotton, sugarcane and tobacco are among the other crops produced in the state. The lower slopes of the [[western ghats]] in [[Kodagu District]], [[Chikmagalur District]] and [[Hassan District]] produce coffee. Sandalwood comes from the dense forested areas of southern Karnataka. These areas were originally the haunt of forest brigand Veerappan and the state has suffered significant losses due to sandalwood smuggling. [[Mysore District]] is the primary producer of raw silk in India and the world famous Mysore silk saris which are manufactured at the Mysore silk factories. Water rich areas of [[Mandya District]], [[Shimoga District]], [[Dakshina Kannada]] districts  produce most of the sugarcane though cultivation of this crop is wide spread. Ragi is grown in [[Tumkur]] and [[Kolar]] and around [[Bangalore]] districts. Jute, Jowar, Bajra, and pulses (Tur and gram) and oil seeds are largely grown in the drier areas of northern and north-central Karnataka. Maize is grown only in the northern tip of the state in [[Bidar District]]. Coconut and Arecanut is grown in the southern districts. Cotton is grown in abundance in [[Gulbarga District]] and [[Davangere District]] is a center of cotton trade and industry. The salubrious weather conditions in coastal areas make cultivation of fruit orchards possible. Rice is grown mostly in the coastal districts. The state holds the fifth rank in national level in [[oilseed]] production. Karnataka accounted for nearly Rs. 2000 crores of horticultural products in 2005. There are many multi-state irrigagion projects being developed, including [[Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects]].

'''Minerals and Industry'''

Over 90% of India's [[gold]] production comes from south Karnataka. Recently there has been a lot of activity in the extraction of [[manganese]] [[ore]] from the districts of [[Bellary]] and [[Hospet]]. Raichur is known to be rich in gold deposits. Most of India's Iron ore comes from the [[Kudremukh]] area of [[Chikmagalur District]]. 
Over 5% of the ''S&P CNX 500'' conglomerates have corporate offices in Karnataka.

===Technology and services===
Karnataka is one of the most industrialised states in [[India]]. Its capital, [[Bangalore]] has become a major worldwide hub of the [[Information Technology]] industry and is the IT capital of India producing approximately 38% of India's software exports which amounts to about $9 billion in 2006. The other IT hub in [[Karnataka]] is [[Mangalore]] , which boasts of not only a historically advanced education standard but also a growing list of Global players in the IT sector. Several companies flourish in Mangalore including [[Infosys]].In 2001 it was rated "Best Employer in India" by Business Today, and in 2002 Business World named Infosys "India's Most Respected Company".

In the mid 1970s [[R.K. Baliga]], Chairman and Managing Director of [[Keonics]] planned to make Bangalore the alternative Silicon Valley. Impetus was received during chiefministership of [[R.Gundu Rao]] in early 1980s. Bangalore is dubbed as the [[Silicon Valley]] of India with more than 50% of all software companies based here. There are about 1,700 companies in all. The software industry is expected to generate US $20 billion by 2010. The Hardware industry is also growing at the same rate as the software industry and presently produces about US $500 million in exports. Karnataka has 50% (131 companies) of all [[Biotechnology]] companies in India and Bangalore accounts for approximately 47% (127 companies) of the total. It generates about 50% of India's total revenues in the sector which is about US $500 million. Recently, the Karnataka government created the first Biotechnology park in India. All three sectors are growing at an average of 35% per year. Also, Bangalore is one of the fast growing cities in the world with more than 6 million people.
The IT industry is spreading to other major centres in Karnataka, namely: [[Mysore]], [[Mangalore]] and [[Hubli]].

'''Carnatic''' 
:''Main article'' [[Carnatic Music]]
The Kannada haridasa movement sowed the seeds of this art in the 13th-15th century AD. With the rise of [[Vaishnavism]] and the [[Haridasa]] movement came Karnataka composers like [[Purandaradasa]], whose Kannada language works were complex, devotional and philosophical. Other haridasas of medeval times were [[Kanakadasa]], [[Vyasatirtha]], [[Jayatirtha]], [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vadirajatirtha]] and others who composed several ''devara nama''. One of the earliest and prominent composers in South India was the saint, and wandering divine singer of yore [[Purandara Dasa]] (1480-1564 AD). Purandara Dasa is believed to have composed 475,000 songs in [[Kannada]] and was a source of inspiration to the later composers like [[Tyagaraja]]. He also invented the tala system of [[Carnatic]] music. Owing to his contribution to the Carnatic Music he is referred to as the ''Father of Carnatic Music'' or ''Karnataka Sangeeta Pitaamaha''. 
Later in the 17th and 18th centuries, the haridasa movement would once again contribute to music in Karnataka the form of haridasas like Vijayadasa, Gopaladasa, Jagannathadasa and others.

'''Hindustani'''

Karnataka's Hindustani Musicians holds a mirror up to the unparalleled achievement of Karnataka. All in a span of only a hundred years. Before which there was no trace of Hindustani Music in Karnataka. Whereas a music stalwart or two are born in ages in other states, scores of stalwarts are born in Karnataka in just a century. Several of them have bagged Kalidas Samman, Padmavibhushan and Tansen Samman. They have enriched the musical tradition of India.

Karnataka has achieved a prominent place in the world of Hindustani music as well. Some famous performers are puttaraj gawai [[Bhimsen Joshi|Pt. Bhimsen Joshi]], [[Madhava Rao Nayak|Pt. Madhava Rao Nayak]], [[Mallikarjun Mansur|Pt. Mallikarjun Mansur]], [[Basavaraj Rajguru]],Sawai Gandharva, Bala Gandharva and [[Gangubai Hangal]].

==Religion==
{{See also|Haridasa|Virashaiva}}
Karnataka played a very important role in shaping present day Indian religion and philosophy. [[Udupi]], [[Sringeri]], [[Gokarna]] and [[Melkote]] are well known places of [[Sanskrit]] learning and [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] learning. [[Shravanabelagola]], [[Mudabidri]], [[Karkala]] are famous for Jain history and monuments.

The great saint [[Madhvacharya]] (1238-1317 AD), proponent of [[dvaita]] philosophy and [[Raghavendra Swami]] were born here. [[Adi Sankara]], proponent of [[advaita]] found enlightenment in [[Sringeri]] which became the first of four [[matha]]s he established in India. Fearing persecution from the Tamil Cholas[[Ramanujacharya]] fled Tamil Nadu and came to Karnataka during the rule of the [[Hoysala]] dynasty and preached his philosophy from [[Melkote]].<ref name="persecution">Fearing persecution by the Cholas who were staunch [[Shaiva]], Ramanujacharya came to Karnataka in [[1098]] and lived there till [[1122]] C.E. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana temple and a well organised [[Matha]] were built. Hoysala Vishnuvardhana became his devotee and converted from Jainism to Hinduism. This helped popularise his Vishva adviata philosophy in the region, ''A Concise History of Karnataka'', Dr. S.U. Kamath, ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', by Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri</ref>
In the 12th century AD, [[Virashaivism]] spread from northern Karnataka across the Deccan. Many of its founders, such as [[Basavanna]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] came from the region.
It was here the [[Jain]] religion got a warm welcome and enjoyed a glorious growth during the medieval period. It is also here where the current day Dzogchen Monastery and the Dhondeling Tibetan Refugee camps are setup and the Tibetans are very well absorbed in the Kannadiga culture.

==Temples==
{{See also|Badami Chalukya Architecture|Hoysala architecture|Vijayanagar Architecture}}
The Empires and Kingdoms that came to rule from Karnataka were prolific builders. The [[Badami]] [[Chalukyas]] spawned the ''[[Vesara]]'' style of architecture and experimented with several myriad styles with frequent intermixing of ''Nagara'' and [[Dravida]] concepts. This period is the beginning of Hindu rock cut architecture, both in stand alone and [[cave]] temple idioms, numerous examples of which exist in [[Pattadakal]], [[Aihole]] and [[Badami]] - ([[Badami Cave temple]]). Their successors, the [[Rashtrakuta]] created master piece temples further favoring [[Indian architecture#Hindu architecture|Dravidian]] concepts. Most of their temples in Karnataka are scattered over northern Karnataka districts.
The [[Ganga Dynasty]] of [[Talakad]] built many Jaina monuments including the monolithic statue of Gomateshwara at [[Shravanabelagola]]. The [[Western Chalukyas]] used the ''In-between'' style, implying a bridge between Chalukya - Rashtrakuta  and [[Hoysala]] styles, with the best temples of their style located in the central districts of [[Gadag district]], [[Koppal district]] and [[Haveri district]]. It was during the reign of the Hoysalas that the temple architecture reached its epoch and gained recognition as an independent style called (Henry Ferguson, Percy Brown) owing to its many unique features. Later the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] would incorporate all these various styles and create a unique blend called Vijayanagar style,
the best examples of which are in the vast open air theater of monuments at [[Hampi]].

==Tourism==
:''Main article'' [[Karnataka tourism]]

[[Image:Somanathapura_Keshava_temple.JPG|right|thumb|250ppx|Keshava temple (1268 C.E.), [[Somanathapura]]]]
[[Image:Barachukki_-_a_revelation.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Barachukki Falls, [[Shivanasamudra]]]]

Karnataka, the eighth largest state in India, is a veritable treasure trove of tourist delights. Of the 3600 centrally protected monuments, 609 are in Karnataka. In addition, the State Directorate of Archaeology and Museums protects 752 other monuments.<ref name="protectde_monuments">[http://deccanherald.com/deccanherald/may172005/spectrum18872005516.asp] Article in ''Spectrum'', May 17, 2005</ref> There is a dazzling array of ancient sculptured temples, modern cities, friendly people, scenic hill ranges, unexplored forests and endless beaches. Karnataka is a place that has all the ingredients for great holiday. Each spot has something special to offer. Broadly, tourism in Karnataka can be divided into four geographical regions.  These are North Karnataka, the Hill Stations, Coastal Karnataka and South Karnataka. 

===North Karnataka===
North Karnataka is a land of harsh dryness accompanied by majestic cliffs, rocky landscapes and magnificent monuments that date back to 5th century. The greatest Kannada empires that ruled the Deccan had their capitals here. Badami [[Chalukya]]n monuments at [[Pattadakal]], [[Aihole]], [[Badami]] are a sight to be seen. Aihole is called the cradle of Hindu rock architecture and has over 125 temples and monuments built between 450 - 1100 CE. [[Rashtrakuta]] monuments at Lokapura, Bilgi and Kuknur and [[Basavakalyana|Kalyani]] Chalukya monuments built in Gadag style at [[Lakkundi]], [[Gadag]], [[Koppal District]] and the famous [[Vijayanagar empire]] temples at [[Vijayanagara]] are the best that it offers. [[Hampi]] in [[Bellary District]] is world famous for the ruins spread over an area of 125 km². with some fifty four world heritage monuments and six hundred and fifty national monuments (''ASI''). An additional three hundred monuments await protection. The Deccan sultanate monuments at [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] and [[Gulbarga]] show unique and discreet Hindu influences and rival the Muslim monuments of North India. Archeologically important locations like Kanganahalli in [[Gulbarga]] have thrown more light on [[Buddhist]] centers of the 1st. c. BCE. - 3rd c. CE era. The first ever statue of emperor [[Ashoka]] with his queens and a [[Prakrit]] inscription ''Rayo Ashoka'' (''ASI'') has been found.

===Hill stations=== 
The Hill stations in Karnataka are generally unexplored and more pristine than better know ones in South India. [[Kudremukh]], [[Kemmangundi]], [[Agumbe]], [[Horanadu]], [[Nandi Hills]] are some of the better known ones. Not much tourism in these areas has kept them free of commercialization. Apart from scenic trekks, bird watching, boating and picturesque waterfalls, these areas are also close to major [[coffee]] producing areas in the state, making a trip all the more interesting. Many resorts have sprung up to accommodate those who want to relax. 

===Coastal Karnataka===
Coastal Karnataka is the stronghold of Hindu and Jain piligrimage spots with [[Udupi]] and its many temples being the centre of [[Dvaita]] philosophy, [[Gokarna]] is known for [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] studies, [[Sringeri]] has the first of the [[Shankaracharya]] [[matha]]s and is important for its [[Advaita]] philosophy, [[Karkala]] and [[Mudabidri]] are well known places of Jain worship. Exquisite Vijayanagar temples built in [[Chalukya]] - [[Malabar region]] combinational style are seen in [[Bhatkal]], [[Kumta]], [[Shirali]] etc. The warm pristine beaches of Karnataka are mostly unspoiled and are only now drawing tourists away from formerly popular places like [[Goa]].

[[Jamboti]], 20 km south-west of [[Belgaum]], is a tourist magnet with its evergreen hilltop forests.

[[Image:Mangalore_fishing.JPG|thumb|right|Fishing in Mukkah, near [[Mangalore]]]] Karnataka is blessed with over 300 km of pristine coastal stretch. [[Netrani]] Island of Uttara Kannada is well known for coral reefs. St. Mary's Island, a few kilometers from Udupi is famous for its basalt rock formations. Sunny beaches at places like Malpe, Murdeshwara, Maravanthe,
Gokarna, Kumta are complimented by spectacular mountains slightly to the east. Agumbe, Kodachadri hills, Kemmangundi, are just a few of many hill stations that straddle the coast providing tourists the best of sun and greenery. Unlike many crowded hill stations in South India, the hill stations of Karnataka are still mostly undiscovered and pristine.

===South Karnataka===
South Karnataka is a unique combination of spectacular [[vesara]] style [[Hoysala]] architecture, colossal Jain monuments, colonial buildings and palaces of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], impregnable fort at [[Chitradurga]] and densely forested wildlife sanctuaries that offer some of the best eco-tourism available in the country. [[Belur]], [[Halebidu]] in [[Hassan District]], [[Somnathpura]] in [[Mysore District]], [[Belavadi]], Kalasa and [[Amrithapura]] in [[Chikmagalur District]], [[Balligavi]] in [[Shimoga District]] offer some of the best of [[Hoysala architecture]] dating from the 11th - 13th century CE.,  while [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]] in [[Mandya District]] have well known 10th century Jain monuments. Scenic forests and the high density of wild animals of this region are a popular attraction for those interested in the wilder side of life. [[Bandipur National Park]], [[Nagarahole]], [[Biligirirangan Hills]], [[Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary]] and [[Bannerghatta]] national parks are a few popular places for jungle safaris.
The river [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]] with beautiful waterfalls as [[Abbey Falls]],flows east from [[Kodagu District]] and along its way one finds important tourist destinations like [[Shivanasamudra]], [[Srirangapattana]] and [[Melkote]] etc. [[Mysore]], the cultural capital of the state is famous for exotic palaces, quaint colonial buildings and cultural activities including [[carnatic]] music, theatre. [[Bangalore]] the capital is the most cosmopilitian city in India and is well known for its parks, pubs, restaurants, shopping and fast paced technology rich lifestyle.

===National parks and wildlife===
[[Image:Irupu1.jpg|thumb|right|''Nari motte'' or Tiger hill, Brahmagiri WLS, Karnataka]]
Karnataka in all has 50 wildlife sanctuaries and 5 National parks. Well known among them are [[Bandipur National Park]] in [[Mysore]] District, [[Bannerghatta National Park]] in [[Bangalore]] district, [[Nagarhole National Park]] in [[Mysore District]] and [[Kodagu]] district, [[Kudremukh National Park]] in [[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Chickmagalur]] district, [[Dandeli]] & [[Anshi National Park]] in [[Uttara Kannada]] district, Gudavi and Mandegadde bird sanctuaries and [[Sharavati]] WLS in [[Shimoga District]], [[Biligirirangan Hills]] WLS in [[Chamarajanagar]] district, [[Rangantittu Bird Sanctuary]] in [[Mandya]] district, [[Brahmagiri]] wildlife sanctuary and [[Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[Kodagu]] district. Interior dry areas have their own unique wildlife. 

There are twenty one wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks in all.

Recently, the government of India has proposed to the UNESCO to include important ecosystems in the [[Western Ghats]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. Two subclusters of natural areas occurring in the list are entirely in the Karnataka region covering several wildlife sanctuaries and some reserve forests. Fragile and exotic ecosystems like [[Kudremukh]] NP, [[Brahmagiri]] WLS, [[Pushpagiri]] WLS, [[Agumbe]], [[Talakaveri]] WLS,  Someshvara WLS figure in this list. As such, the Western Ghats that run south-north through the Karnataka is considered as one among the twenty five bio-diversity hotspots of the world.

The Niligiri Biosphere Reserve (also a designated [[UNESCO]] Biosphere reserve) is located at the junction of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerela. [[Nagarahole National Park]] WLS and [[Bandipur National Park]] and Nugu WLS in Karnataka are included in this [[biosphere reserve]].

The state is home to the largest concentration of Asian Elephants along Kabini River in Nagarahole and Bandipur parks. These two parks are also hold among the most viable population of the highly endangered Indian Tiger. Rannebennur Blackbuck sanctuary in [[Davangere district]] is home to one of the largest populations of blackbuck anywhere in India. The Doraji wildlife sanctuary and areas in Karnataka like [[Bellary district]], [[Chitradurga]] are strongholds of the sloth bear. 

Karnataka is home to more than 500 species of [[bird]]s.<ref name="birds">http://www.karnatakabirds.net</ref>
