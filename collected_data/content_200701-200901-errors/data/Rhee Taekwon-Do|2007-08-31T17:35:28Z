'''Rhee Taekwon-Do''', also known as '''Rhee Tae Kwon-Do''', '''Rhee Tae Kwon Do''', or '''Rhee Taekwondo''',{{fn|1}} is a [[martial arts]] school in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]{{fn|2}} teaching the [[Korean martial art]] of [[taekwondo]]. Its full name is "Rhee International Taekwon-Do" with "(Australia)" or "(New Zealand)" appended.

'''Chong Chul Rhee''' is an 8th degree [[black belt]], holds the title "World Master", claims the title "Father of Australian Taekwon-Do",<ref name="Founding"/><ref name="YellowPages"/><ref name="AustralasianFightingArts"/><ref name="WorldWideWeb"/> and is the founder and head of Rhee Taekwon-Do. He is one of the twelve original masters of taekwondo<ref name="OriginalMasters">[http://www.itfnz.org.nz/ref/documents/masters.htm A tribute to the original masters] Retrieved on [[13 June]] [[2007]].</ref> selected from the South Korean military to develop taekwondo under [[Choi Hong Hi|Hong Hi Choi]] in the Korea Taekwon-Do Association (KTA).{{fn|3}} Rhee is a former unarmed combat instructor in the Korean Marines, and helped introduce the art of taekwondo to [[Southeast Asia]] (notably in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]) before becoming the first taekwondo master sent to Australia by the [[Republic of Korea]].

Rhee has worked towards the [[Korean reunification|reunification of Korea]], serving as a member during the third through ninth terms—and as Chairman for the eighth term—of the Oceania Division of the Advisory Council for Democratic and Peaceful Unification.<ref name="ODCC">[http://www.acdpuoceania.com/formal_chairman_e.html Former Chairmen of the ODCC] Retrieved on [[24 April]] [[2003]]; link has expired, as at [[15 July]] [[2007]].</ref> He has also served as Chairman of the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympics]] Supporting Committee and founding President of the Korean Community Hall Construction Supporting Committee.<ref name="ODCC"/> The Republic of Korea awarded Rhee the [[Dongbaeg Medal]] (''[[Hangul|동백장]]'') in 2003 for promoting taekwon-do and Korean culture over the past 33 years.<ref name="SydneyKoreanHerald"/>

Two of Rhee's brothers also hold the title of Master in Rhee Taekwon-Do,{{fn|4}} and assist him in managing parts of the school:

* '''Chong Hyup Rhee''', 7th Dan, in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], is also one of the twelve original masters of taekwon-do,<ref name="OriginalMasters"/> and appears on the right in the school's logo.

* '''Chong Yoon Rhee''', 7th Dan, in [[New South Wales]], is a former South Korean army officer.

C. C. Rhee holds grading examinations for Rhee Taekwon-Do across most of Australia and New Zealand, while C. H. Rhee holds the grading examinations in Melbourne and Darwin.<ref name="Darwin">[http://www.angelfire.com/empire2/rhee/ Rhee Tae Kwon Do NT] Retrieved on [[24 August]] [[2007]].</ref>

== Significance ==

Rhee Taekwon-Do occupies a prominent place in Australian taekwon-do history. This is reflected in three key claims:<ref name="YellowPages"/><ref name="AustralasianFightingArts"/> (1) Rhee is the Father of Australian Taekwon-Do, (2) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the first taekwon-do school in Australia, and (3) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the biggest taekwon-do school in Australia. The school has widely publicised these claims since at least the [[1980s]].

=== Father of Australian Taekwon-Do ===

No one has challenged Rhee's claim as the Father of Australian Taekwon-Do. The title might be debated, however, based on claims made about four other martial art masters:

[[Image:070616-Janggeom-Ladies.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ladies' training session being conducted by a senior Rhee Taekwon-Do instructor]]

* '''Chan Yong Kim''', 9th Dan, was the first [[Tang Soo Do|tang soo do]] instructor in Australia.<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky">Ta'kody, J. (2001): "Jack Rozinsky: The art of a lifetime (Part 1)," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 10(1):8–11.</ref> He arrived in the early 1960s,<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky"/><ref name="Kim1">[http://www.nostaekwondo.com.au/taekwondo.htm No's Taekwondo] Retrieved on [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="Kim2">Stone, B. (2003): "Man of honour: Master Ke Hyung No," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 12(3):14–17.</ref> sponsored by the Silvertop Taxi Karate Club<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky"/><ref name="Rozinsky1">Anon. (2007): "Jack Rozinsky," in S. Morelli (Ed.), ''Taekwondo: Special collector's edition 2007'' (pp. 54–55). Mulgrave, Australia: Blitz Publications.</ref> or the Australian Judo Federation,<ref name="Kim3">[http://www.thackreytkd.com/chanyongkim.shtml Biography of Grandmaster Chan-Yong Kim] Retrieved on [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref> and stayed for one or two years before moving overseas. Kim might be considered the first taekwon-do instructor in Australia,{{fn|5}} and so might lay claim to the title. He did not establish a taekwon-do school in Australia.

* '''Jack Rozinsky''', 9th Dan ([[Jidokwan]]), founded the Shuto Karate Club in 1963;<ref name="Rozinsky1"/><ref name="Rozinsky2">Rozinsky, J. (1996): "Fighting frames," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 4(4):53.</ref> it later became the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre. As Rozinsky taught tang soo do there, he might be considered the first taekwon-do school founder in Australia,{{fn|5}} and so might lay claim to the title. He did not introduce taekwon-do outside Victoria.

* '''Terence Walsh''', 8th Dan (World Kido Federation), claims to have introduced taekwon-do to New South Wales in 1969.<ref name="Walsh1">Walsh, T. F. (1999): "Grandmaster Kwang Sung Hang: Taekwondo pioneer," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 8(3):48–50.</ref><ref name="Walsh2">[http://www.walshtkd.com/ Walsh Martial Arts Australia] Retrieved on [[14 June]] [[2007]].</ref> If he was the first to introduce taekwon-do to Australia's most populous state, then he might lay claim to the title. He did not introduce taekwon-do outside the eastern states.

* '''Young Ku Yun''', 8th Dan (ITF), has been described as having introduced taekwon-do to [[Sydney]] in 1971.<ref name="Yun1">Anon. (1997): "Grandmaster Yun: The changing face of martial arts," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 6(2):9–12.</ref> If he was the first to introduce taekwon-do to Australia's largest city, then he might lay claim to the title. He arrived around five years after Rhee, however, and himself claimed to be the first ITF taekwon-do instructor (rather than the first taekwon-do instructor) in Australia.<ref name="Yun2">[http://www.yunjungdo.com.au/ Yun Jung Do] Retrieved on [[21 June]] [[2007]].</ref>

Kim would have been in the lower Dan ranks, and would not yet have held the title of Master, when he was invited to teach in Australia. Rozinsky and Walsh would have held 1st Dan ranking in the 1960s. Both Rhee (KTA) and Yun (ITF) would have been in the middle Dan ranks and held the title of Master when they arrived, as they were sent to Australia by their respective Korean governing bodies.

=== First taekwon-do school in Australia ===

Rhee Taekwon-Do's position as the first taekwon-do school in Australia might be challenged by the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre (originally the Shuto Karate Club),<ref name="Rozinsky1"/> as tang soo do was one of the arts taught there.{{fn|5}} Rhee's school is the first nationwide taekwon-do school in Australia, having operated in South Australia from at least 1967, Western Australia from at least 1970,<ref name="Fricke1">Fricke, H.

=== Biggest taekwon-do school in Australia ===

Rhee Taekwon-Do's position as the biggest taekwon-do school in Australia is supported by independently-verifiable listings of dojang.<ref name="YellowPages"/><ref name="NationalListing"/> The claim might be disputed if the Australian members of the ITF and the WTF are considered as 'schools' as a whole, but Rhee Taekwon-Do is a single school under the direct leadership of Rhee while both the ITF<ref name="ITFConstitution1">[http://www.itftkd.org/fileadmin/archive/commons/20070508_ITF_Constitution.pdf International Taekwon-Do Federation Constitution (28 April 2007)] (ITF-NK, Chang) Retrieved on [[26 August]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="ITFConstitution2">[http://www.itf-administration.com/constitution.asp International Taekwon-Do Federation Constitution] (ITF-C, Choi) Retrieved on [[26 August]] [[2007]].</ref> and WTF<ref name="WTFOrganisation">[http://www.wtf.org/site/about_wtf/organization.htm World Taekwondo Federation organizational chart] Retrieved on [[26 August]] [[2007]].</ref> are groups of schools (each with its own head) under a larger governing body.

== Ex-Rhee members ==

The founders of several Australian martial art schools (and at least one school in New Zealand) received their foundational taekwon-do training in Rhee Taekwon-Do, or are themselves former Rhee Taekwon-Do instructors. Of these ex-members, the highest-ranked were Rhee Taekwon-Do 3rd Dan instructors when they left Rhee's school.

[[Image:070617-Janggeom-Promotion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rhee promoting a member to the rank of Rhee Taekwon-Do 1st Dan]]

=== ITF ===

Ex-members who founded ITF taekwon-do schools include three of the most senior ITF instructors in Australia: Ming Tuck Low, 8th Dan;<ref name="Low1">McQueen, P. (2006): "Smart—not hard," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 15(2):28–33.</ref><ref name="Low2">Ainley, M.

Wong trained in Rhee Taekwon-Do in Western Australia in the early 1970s. Moore commenced Rhee Taekwon-Do training in Queensland in 1976. Several other ex-Rhee members have founded ITF schools.{{fn|6}}

=== Other taekwon-do styles ===

Ex-members who founded non-ITF taekwon-do schools include three of the more expansionist instructors in Australia: John Ivanov, 7th Dan;<ref name="Ivanov-Dicks">Anon. (1995): "Inside Rhee Tae Kwon-Do," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 4(3):15–17.</ref><ref name="Ivanov">[http://www.southpacifictkd.com.au/ South Pacific Taekwon-Do] Retrieved on [[26 August]] [[2007]].</ref> Robert Frost, 6th Dan;<ref name="Frost1">[http://www.toogee.com/ Toogee Taekwondo] Retrieved on [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="Frost2">[http://toogeetreks.com/aboutus.htm Toogee Treks] Retrieved on [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref> and Lesley Hicks, 6th Dan.<ref name="Hicks1">Seedsman, N., & Stone, B.

Frost was a Rhee Taekwon-Do regional instructor in New South Wales in 2003. Hicks commenced Rhee Taekwon-Do training in the late 1970s,<ref name="Hicks3">Anon. (2007): "Master Les Hicks," in S. Morelli (Ed.), ''Taekwondo: Special collector's edition 2007'' (pp. 98–99). Mulgrave, Australia: Blitz Publications.</ref> and was a Rhee Taekwon-Do 3rd Dan regional instructor in New South Wales in 2003. These three ex-Rhee members now lead taekwon-do schools that operate across more than one state. At least two other ex-Rhee members have founded non-ITF taekwon-do schools.{{fn|7}}

=== Other martial arts ===

Ex-members who founded schools teaching martial arts other than taekwon-do (whether exclusively or primarily) include three instructors with an eclectic martial arts history: Hans Fricke, 8th Dan;<ref name="Fricke1"/><ref name="Fricke2">[http://www.japaneseswordsmanship.com.au/ABA_ranks_32.html Australian Battodo Association Dan registry] Retrieved on [[25 August]] [[2007]].</ref> Christopher Nasilowski, 10th Dan;<ref name="Nasilowski">[http://www.usadojo.com/biographies/christopher-nasilowski.htm Martial arts biography: Christopher Nasilowski] Retrieved on [[30 July]] [[2007]].</ref> and Graham Healy, 7th Dan.<ref name="Healy">[http://healyshealthandfitness.com/ Healy's Health and Fitness] Retrieved on [[14 June]] [[2007]].</ref> Fricke first met Rhee in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1970, was a Rhee Taekwon-Do instructor in Sydney during the 1970s, and now teaches [[Battōjutsu|battodo]]. Nasilowski trained in Rhee Taekwon-Do in Adelaide from 1972–1984, was a Rhee Taekwon-Do 2nd Dan instructor, and now teaches [[Filipino martial arts|arnis]] and [[Jujutsu|jujitsu]]. Healy commenced Rhee Taekwon-Do training in Queensland in the 1970s, was a Rhee Taekwon-Do instructor, and now teaches [[boxing]] and taekwon-do. At least three other ex-Rhee members have founded other martial art schools.{{fn|8}}

== Training ==

[[Image:070617-Janggeom-Drill.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Rhee Taekwon-Do self-defence drill to practise deflecting an incoming punch aimed at the face]]

Rhee Taekwon-Do [[training]] consists of exercises that may be classified as: basics (group drill exercises), destruction (breaking), [[hyung]] (patterns or forms), [[self-defence]], and sparring. Basics, destruction, hyung, and self-defence are similar to equivalent exercises in other traditional martial art schools. Rhee Taekwon-Do [[sparring]] is different to that in ITF and WTF schools, having more in common with [[Kumite#Delivering_strikes|traditional karate sparring]].

Rhee Taekwon-Do sparring is unscored, unarmoured,<ref name="Sparring1">Anon. (1993): "Master Rhee: Interview by a special reporter," ''Rhee Taekwondo'', Autumn 1993:4–5.</ref> and usually 'non-contact' in principle. Members typically achieve non-contact sparring by two methods, whether separately or in combination:

* '''The attacker''' consciously stops just short of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with full speed and power.<ref name="Sparring1"/><ref name="Sparring2">Lofthouse, D. (1993): "No contact," ''Rhee Taekwondo'', Summer 1993:7.</ref> The attacker has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other.

* '''The defender''' actively avoids or blocks an incoming attack executed by the training partner.<ref name="Sparring3">Coleman, A. (1993): "Effective self-defence is learnt through non-contact sparring," ''Rhee Taekwondo'', Summer 1993:31.</ref> The defender has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs with training partners of similar experience.

== Ranks ==

[[Image:070616-Janggeom-Tiles.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A twin knife-hand strike into two stacks of roof tiles as part of a Rhee Taekwon-Do 2nd Dan grading test]]

Rhee Taekwon-Do [[Rank|ranks]] are denoted by coloured belts, which indicate a member's level of experience and responsibility within the school. There are ten coloured belt grades ([[Kup rank]]s; ''[[Hangul|급]]'') and nine [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] degrees ([[Dan rank]]s; ''[[Hangul|단]]'').<ref name="Rank">See any ''Rhee Taekwon-Do'' membership booklet.</ref>

Members start with white belts and progress through yellow, green, blue, brown, and then black. 'Tips' denoting odd-numbered Kup ranks are marked by a stripe of the higher colour near the right end (from the wearer's point of view) of a belt of the lower colour. Dan ranks are represented by a white bars embroidered on a black belt. A black belt with no bars is a Junior Black Belt, a rank assigned to members considered too young for 1st Dan.

To attain Rhee Taekwon-Do 1st Dan ranking typically takes around five years of regular training. Progression through the school's Dan ranks is by invitation,<ref name="Craig">Anon. (2006): "Juliette presented with high honour from World Master," ''Maryborough Herald'' (10 May 2006), p. 21.</ref> and is usually slower than in other taekwon-do schools. Promotion to 2nd Dan might come after 10–15 years, in which time someone might have reached 4th Dan (ITF)<ref name="Choi">Choi, H. H. (1993): ''Taekwon-Do: The Korean art of self-defence, 3rd ed.'' (Vol. 1, p. 94). Mississauga: International Taekwon-Do Federation.</ref> or 5th Dan (WTF).<ref name="Kukkiwon">[http://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/english/examination/examination08.jsp?div=01 Kukkiwon promotion test regulations (Article 8)] Retrieved on [[19 July]] [[2007]].</ref> Promotion to 3rd Dan might come after 20–25 years, in which time someone might have reached 6th Dan (ITF)<ref name="Choi"/> or 7th Dan (WTF).<ref name="Kukkiwon"/> Several former Rhee Taekwon-Do instructors who joined other taekwon-do organisations received new ranks consistent with these approximations.{{fn|9}}
