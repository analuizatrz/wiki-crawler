===Career===
Willis left New York City and headed to [[California]] to audition for several television shows.<ref name="DailyM"/> He auditioned for the [[Television program|TV series]] ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' (1985&ndash;89), while competing against 3,000 other actors for the position and was selected to play David Addison Jr.<ref name="YahooM">{{cite web | title=Yahoo! Movies|work= Bruce Willis Biography|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018749/bio | accessmonthday=June 21 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> The starring role helped to establish him as a [[comedy|comedic]] actor, with the show lasting five seasons. During the height of the show's success, beverage maker [[Seagram]] hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden Wine Cooler products. The memorable ad campaign paid the rising star between five and seven million dollars over two years. In spite of that, Willis chose not renew his contract with the company when he decided to stop drinking alcohol in 1988.<ref name="Playboy">{{Citation |last=Grobel|first=Lawrence|title=Playboy Interview: Bruce Willis|newspaper=Playboy|pages=59-79|year=1988|date=November 1988|accessdate=June 27}}</ref> One of his first major film roles was in the 1987 [[Blake Edwards]] film ''[[Blind Date]]'' alongside [[Kim Basinger]] and [[John Laroquette]]. However, it was his then-unexpected turn in the film ''[[Die Hard]]'' that catapulted him to fame. He performed most of his own [[stunt]]s in the film,<ref name="People1">{{cite web | title=People.com | work=Bruce Willis: Biography

He also provided his voice for a talking baby in ''[[Look Who's Talking]]'' and its sequel.

In the late-1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a [[recording artist]], recording an album of pop-blues entitled ''[[The Return of Bruno (album)|The Return of Bruno]]'', which included the hit single "Respect Yourself",<ref name="TopSongs">{{cite web | title=The Eighties Club|work=Top 100 Songs of 1987|url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id224.htm | accessmonthday=June 23 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> promoted by a [[Spinal Tap]]-like [[rockumentary]] [[parody]] featuring scenes of him performing at famous events including [[Woodstock]]. Follow-up recordings were not as successful, though Willis has returned to the recording studio several times. In the early [[1990s in film|1990s]], Willis' career suffered a moderate slump starring in [[flop]]s such as ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'', ''[[Striking Distance]]'' and a film he co-wrote entitled ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'', among others. He starred in a leading role in the highly sexualized thriller ''[[Color of Night]]'' (1994), which was very poorly received by critics but has become popular on video. However, in 1994 he had a supporting role in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s acclaimed ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which gave a new boost to his career. In 1996, he was the [[executive producer]] of the [[cartoon]] ''[[Bruno the Kid]]'' which featured a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] representation of himself.<ref name="FilmRef">{{cite web | title=Film Reference|work=Bruce Willis Biography (1955-)| url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/99/Bruce-Willis.html | accessmonthday=June 23 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> He went on to play the lead roles in ''[[Twelve Monkeys]]'' and ''[[The Fifth Element]]''. However, by the end of the 1990s, his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like ''[[The Jackal (film)|The Jackal]]'', ''[[Mercury Rising]]'', and ''[[Breakfast of Champions (film)|Breakfast of Champions]]'', saved only by the success of the [[Michael Bay]]-directed ''[[Armageddon (film)|Armageddon]]'' which was the highest grossing film of 1998 worldwide.<ref name="BOM2">{{cite web | title=Box Office Mojo|work=1998 WORLDWIDE GROSSES| url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=1998&p=.htm | accessmonthday=June 21 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the [[PlayStation]] video game ''[[Apocalypse (video game)|Apocalypse]]''.<ref name="EWeekly">{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly|work="Apocalypse" Now| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,286028,00.html | accessmonthday=June 21 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>

In 1999, Willis then went on to the starring role in [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s film, ''[[The Sixth Sense]]''. The film was both a commercial and critical success and helped to increase interest in his acting career.
He once had to appear in the [[sitcom]] ''[[Friends]]'' without pay, because he lost a [[bet]] to [[Matthew Perry (actor)|Matthew Perry]], his co-star in the comedy ''[[The Whole Nine Yards (film)|The Whole Nine Yards]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Whole Ten Yards]]''. He won a 2000 [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on ''Friends'' (in which he played the father of [[Ross Geller]]'s much-younger girlfriend). He was also nominated for a 2001 American Comedy Award (in the Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series category) for his work on ''Friends''. Willis was originally cast as Terry Benedict in ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (2001) but dropped out to work on recording an album. In ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' (2003), he makes a [[cameo appearance]] as himself. He recently appeared in the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' half of the double feature ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' as the [[villain]], a mutant soldier. This marks Willis' second collaboration with [[Film director|director]] [[Robert Rodriguez]], following ''[[Sin City]]''.

===Military interests===
[[Image:Bruce Willis 1.jpg|thumb|right|Willis meeting members of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] on [[July 25]] [[2002]]]]
Throughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as ''[[The Siege]]'', ''[[Hart's War]]'', ''[[Tears of the Sun]]'', and ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''. Growing up in a [[military brat|military family]], Willis has been publicly supportive of the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis' youngest daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase [[Girl Scout cookies]] to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard [[USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)|USS ''John F. Kennedy'']] and other troops stationed throughout the [[Middle East]] at the time.<ref name="FindAr">{{cite web | title=USS John F.

Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war: 
{{cquote2|I went to [[Iraq]] because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers &mdash; young kids for the most part &mdash; helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, <nowiki>'</nowiki>X number of people were killed today,<nowiki>'</nowiki> which I think does a huge disservice.

Willis has said that he wants to "make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and [[democracy]]."<ref name="TimesOnline">{{cite web | title=Times Online | work=Bruce Willis comes out fighting for Iraq's forgotten GI heroes | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article597133.ece | accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> The film will follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in [[Mosul]] and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of [[blogger]] [[Michael Yon]], a former [[United States Army Special Forces]] [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] who was [[embedded]] with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their activities. Willis described the [[plot]] of the film as "these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom."<ref name="Holly3">{{cite web | title=Hollywood.com | work=Willis to Make Movie Honoring U.S. Troops in Iraq | url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Willis_to_Make_Movie_Honoring_US_Troops_in_Iraq/3469589 | accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref>

==Cultural references==
In 1996, Roger Director, a writer and producer from ''Moonlighting'' wrote a [[roman à clef]] on Willis titled ''A Place to Fall''.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite web |last=Gates|first=Anita|title=Moonlighting|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E5DC1439F937A15750C0A960958260| accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> [[Cybill Shepherd]] wrote in her 2000 autobiography, ''Cybill Disobedience'', that Willis was angry at Director, because the character was written as a "neurotic, petulant actor."
