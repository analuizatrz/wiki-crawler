{{Campaignbox Balkans Campaign}}

The '''Battle of Greece''' (also know as '''Operation Marita''', {{lang-de|Unternehmen Marita}}<ref name="C3-4">Center of Military Editions (1984-1986), [http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 82]</ref>) was an important [[World War II]] battle which occurred on the Greek mainland and in southern [[Albania]]. The battle was fought between the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] ([[Greece]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]) and the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] ([[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Fascist Italy]]) forces. With the [[Battle of Crete]] and several naval actions, the Battle of Greece is considered part of the wider [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] component of the [[Balkans Campaign]] of [[World War II]].

The Battle of Greece is regarded as the continuation of the [[Greco-Italian War]]. Italian troups invaded Greece on [[October 28]], [[1940]], but within weeks not only had they been driven from Greek territory, but Greek forces had pushed on to occupy much of southern [[Albania]]. In March 1941 a major Italian counterattack failed, and Germany, the main Axis power, was thus obliged to assist its ally. The execution of Operation Marita started on [[April 6]], [[1941]], when German troops invaded Greece through [[Bulgaria]] to secure its southern flank. The combined Greek and British forces fought back with great tenacity but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, and finally collapsed. [[Athens]] fell on [[April 27]], but the British Commonwealth managed to evacuate nearly 50,000 troops. The Battle of Greece ended with the fall of [[Kalamata]] in the [[Peloponnese]]. 

Some historians regard the Greco-Italian War and the Battle of Greece as decisive in determining the future course of World War II, because they delayed the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="KR">Keegan (2005), 144<br>* Riefenstahl (1987), 295</ref> German officials expressed their admiration for the strong resistance of the Greek soldiers, who were also paid homage by the leaders of the Allies. 

==Background: Greco-Italian War==
{{details|Greco-Italian War}}
===Prelude===
{{rquote|left|Hitler always faces me with a fait accompli. This time I am going to pay him back in his own coin. He will find out from the papers that I have occupied Greece.<ref name="C247">Ciano (1946), 247</ref>|[[Benito Mussolini]] speaking to [[Galeazzo Ciano|Count Ciano]]}}
At the outbreak of World War II [[Ioannis Metaxas]], [[Prime Minister of Greece]] during the [[dictatorial]] [[4th of August Regime]] (from 1936 until his death in 1941), tried to maintain [[Neutral country|neutrality]], but [[Greece]] was increasingly subject to pressure from Italy. The culmination of this pressure was the torpedoing of Greek [[Light cruiser|cruiser]] ''[[Greek cruiser Elli|Elli]]'' on [[August 15]], [[1940]] near the island of [[Tinos]] by the Italian submarine ''Delfino''.<ref name="H">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greece, History of|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia "The Helios"}}</ref> Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], having already occupied Albania (Greece's north-western neighbour) and several British Commonwealth strongholds in [[Africa]], hoped to continue his expansion with the conquest of Greece.<ref name="G53">Goldstein (1992), 53</ref> Therefore, he sought an easy military triumph to match those of [[Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]], who had unleashed its [[Blitzkrieg]] and overrun much of Western Europe. Mussolini was also irritated that Hitler had not first consulted him on war policy, and hoped to show his independence{{Cref|a}} with a successful attack on Greece, which was regarded by him as an easy opponent.<ref name="BG">Buckley (1984), 18<br>* Goldstein (1992), 53</ref> 

===Italian invasion, Greek counterattack, and Italian spring offensive===
On [[October 15]], [[1940]] Mussolini decided to invade Greece,{{Cref|b}} and in the early morning hours of [[October 28]] Italian Ambassador [[Emmanuel Grazzi]] presented Metaxas a three-hour [[ultimatum]]: Italy demanded free passage for his troops to occupy unspecified "strategic sites" inside Greek territory.<ref name="B17">Buckley (1984), 17</ref> Metaxas rejected the ultimatum (the refusal of the ultimatum is commemorated as [[Okhi Day]] in Greece), but even before its expiration Italian troops had invaded Greece from Albania.{{Cref|c}}

[[Image:Greekitalianwarmap.gif|thumb|350px|left|Map of Greco-Italian war.]]

The principal Italian thrust was delivered in [[Pindus]] towards the city of [[Ioannina]] and made some progress at first. The Greek troops, unable to match the Italian armour or Italian attacks from the air, took to higher ground and lobbed their mortar shells and artillery pieces down upon the massed enemy. The Italians crossed the [[Kalamas river]] and approached [[Ioannina]], but were soon driven back and pursued beyond Greek territory and into Albania.<ref name="WWT">[http://www.worldwar-2.net/timelines/war-in-europe/southern-europe/southern-europe-index-1940.htm Southern Europe], World War-2.Net</ref> Further north the Greeks checked Italian attempts to advance, and then passed on the offensive. Within three weeks Greek territory was clear of the invader and a full scale counterattack was in place.<ref>Buckley (1984), 19</ref> The counterattack was met with great success, while a change in Italian commanders and the arrival of considerable reinforcements had little effect. [[Korçë]], a major city in south-eastern Albania, fell to Greek forces on [[November 13]], to be followed by [[Pogradec]], [[Argyrokastron]] on [[December 4]], [[Himarë]] on [[December 24]], and [[Kelcyre]] on [[January 10]].<ref>Buckley (1984), 18-20</ref>

After weeks of inconclusive winter warfare the Italians, supervised by Mussolini himself, launched a full scale counterattack all along the front on [[March 9]], [[1941]]. Within two hours, 100,000 rounds of artillery were fired and Greek positions were bombed from the air. Despite the superiority of the Italian armed forces, the counterattack failed. After one week and 12,000 casualties, Mussolini called off the counterattack, and left Albania twelve days later.<ref name="BB">Bailey (1984), 22<br>* [http://www.onwar.com/chrono/1941/mar41/f16mar41.htm More U-boat Aces Hunted down], OnWar.Com</ref> 

===Effect on the imminent German invasion===
[[Image:GreekItalianwarmap2.gif|thumb|200px|right|Extent of Greek advance.]]
In the six month fight against Italy, the Greek army made local gains by eliminating enemy salients, but it was difficult to foretell how a German attack would affect it. Moreover, since Greece had practically no armament industry, its equipment and ammunition supplies consisted mainly of stocks that the British had captured from the defeated Italian armies in [[North Africa]]. In order to feed the battle in Albania, the Greek command had been forced to make continuous withdrawals from eastern [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and western [[Thrace]]. To reverse this process in anticipation of a German attack was inexpedient, because the available forces were inadequate for sustained resistance on both fronts. The Greek command therefore decided to continue its successful resistance in Albania, no matter how the situation might develop under the impact of a German attack across the [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] border.<ref name="C72">Center of Military Editions (1984-1986), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 70-71]</ref>

==British aid to Greece and diplomatic background==
{{Cquote2|quotetext=''Ζήτω η Ελλάς'' (''Long live Greece'')|personquoted=[[Winston Churchill]]|quotesource=Telegraph to Metaxas written in Greek<ref name="Helios">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greece, History of|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia The Helios}}</ref>|quotewidth=20px|quoteheight=20px}}
In 1939 the United Kingdom had extended a guarantee of military aid if Greek territorial integrity was threatened. Although the [[British army]] was committed to fighting in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] and could not spare many military units or war material to assist Greece, British public opinion was inspired by the way the Greeks had repulsed the Italians, and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] thought it was UK's duty to aid the Greeks.<ref name="Helios" /> The first British help to Greece were a few [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] squadrons under [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[John d'Albiac]], sent to aid the small Royal [[Hellenic Air Force]] in November 1940.<ref>Barrass, [http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/DAlbiac.htm Air Marshal Sir John D'Albiac]<br>* Beevor (1992), 26</ref> With the consent of the Greek government, British forces were dispatched to [[Crete]] on [[3 November]] to guard [[Suda Bay]], thereby enabling the Greek government to deploy the 5th Cretan Division, to the mainland where it helped repel the Italian invasion.<ref>Vick (1995), 22</ref> Early on, however, voices were raised among the British commanders against committing some of the already limited forces from North Africa to mainland Greece, a move which would both weaken their position in Libya, and be of little help to the Greeks. 
[[Image:Australiantroopsembarking.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Australian soldiers in Egypt embarking for Greece.]]

During a meeting of British and Greek military and political leaders which took place in Athens on [[13 January]], [[1941]] [[strategos|General]] [[Alexandros Papagos]], [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Hellenic Army]], reviewed the situation and expressed the opinion that Yugoslavia would probably remain [[neutral country|neutral]]. The minimum assistance he asked from Britain was nine fully equipped  divisions with corresponding air support. These divisions should arrive in eastern Macedonia and western Thrace before the Germans moved from Romania to Bulgaria and assembled their forces for the attack on Greece. Secrecy and deception as to the ultimate destination of the British expeditionary force, which was to be assembled in [[Egypt]], were essential to prevent any German interference. However, all the British could offer was two to three divisions and a relatively small number of planes whose arrival would furthermore be delayed by the existing shortage of shipping. The British suggested the immediate dispatch of a small token force of less than divisional strength. This offer was rejected by the Greeks who feared that the arrival of such a contingent would precipitate a German attack without giving them any sizable assistance. British help would be requested if and when German troops crossed the Danube from Romania into Bulgaria.<ref name="BC">Beevor (1992), 38<br>* Center of Military Editions (1984-1986), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 71-72]</ref>

Churchill still wanted however to recreate a Balkan Front comprising Yugolavia, Greece and [[Turkey]].<ref name="C1992" /> He thus sent [[Anthony Eden]] and Sir [[John Dill]] to resume negotiations with the Greek government. At a meeting in [[Athens]] on [[February 22]] between Eden and the Greek leadership, the decision to send a British Commonwealth expeditionary force was taken. Already German troops had been massing in Romania, and on [[1 March]] [[1941]], [[Wehrmacht]] forces began to move into Bulgaria. At the same time, the [[Bulgarian Army]] mobilized and took up positions along the Greek frontier.<ref name="C1992" /> 

On [[March 2]] [[Operation Lustre]], the transportation of troops and equipment to Greece, got
under way, and 26 [[troopship]]s first arrived at the port of [[Piraeus]], accompanied by the cruiser ''[[HMS Calcutta|Calcutta]]'', from which disembarked the first Australian troops.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greece, History of|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia The Helios}}<br>* Simpson (2004), 86-87</ref> Until [[April 24]] 58.000 British, Australian, and New Zealand troops were sent to Greece, comprising the [[6th Australian Division]], the [[New Zealand 2nd Division]], and the [[British 1st Armoured Brigade|British 1st Armoured Brigade Group]].<ref>[http://orbat.com/site/ww2/drleo/017_britain/41-04_greece/_w-force.html Balkan Operations &ndash; Order of Battle &ndash; W-Force &ndash; 5th April 1941], Orders of Battle</ref> The three formations later became known as 'W' Force from their commanding general [[Henry Maitland Wilson]].{{Cref|d}} 

==Allied troop dispositions prior to the German invasion==
Despite increasing evidence of German troops crossing the Danube into Bulgaria in the early spring of 1941, the Greek and British Commonwealth—[[United Kingdom|U.K.]], [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]]—forces operating in the region were unable to establish a cohesive front because of disagreements between their respective commands.<ref>Bailey, Robert H. (1979). Partisans and Guerrillas (World War II). Time Life UK. ISBN 0-8094-2490-8 p. 37</ref>

The Greeks had been insistent on fighting their battle along the [[Metaxas Line]], a massive line of fortifications that had been built along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s. This course of action was expected to take advantage of the naturally difficult terrain and the prepared fortifications, while protecting the strategically important port of [[Thessalonica]]. It disregarded the fact however, that the forces and equipment available were only adequate for a token resistance, and that the Metaxas Line was vulnerable to flanking through the Vardar Valley if the neutrality of Yugoslavia was violated. Obsessed with the rivalry against [[Bulgaria]], and being on traditionally good terms with the Yugoslavs, the Greeks had left the Yugoslav border largely undefended.<ref>Bailey, p. 37</ref>

By contrast, W Force formed a main line of resistance along the Kleidi line, running in a roughly south-east direction from the town of [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] to the delta of the [[Vardar]] River. The advantage of this course of action was that it required fewer forces, and that more time would be available for preparing the position. However, it also involved abandoning nearly the whole of Northern Greece, which was unacceptable to the Greeks for political and psychological reasons. Moreover, the left flank of this line too was susceptible to flanking from Germans operating through the [[Monastir]] gap in [[Yugoslavia]].<ref>Buckley, p. 40-45</ref>

The product of this disagreement was that eventually two distinct lines of resistance were set up, one along the Metaxas Line and one along the Kleidi line, both of which were undermanned. Predictably, both were easily overrun by the Germans, despite occasional acts of heroism. From the onset however, the Allies were at a huge disadvantage because the main mass of the Greek army was committed in Albania and could not be used to face the German threat.

==German invasion==
[[Image:Campaigns-16.jpg|thumb|right|250px|German artillery shelling the Metaxas Line.]]

===Metaxas Line===
On [[April 6]], [[1941]], the German Army invaded northern Greece, while other elements launched an attack against Yugoslavia. The Metaxas Line was defended by the Greek Eastern Macedonia Army Section (''Tμήμα Στρατıάς Ανατολικής Μακεδονίας'' or ''TΣAM'') under the command of Lt. General Konstantinos Bakopoulos, comprising 7th, 14th and 17th Infantry Divisions, all under-strength.  The line ran for ca. 170 km along the River Nestos in the east, and then along the Bulgarian border as far as [[Belasica|Mount Beles]] near the Yugoslav border. The fortifications were designed to garrison an army of over 200,000 but were only manned by roughly 70,000 soldiers to face the German threat due to lack of manpower. As a result of the small numbers, the line's defences were spread thin.<ref>Buckley, p. 30-33</ref> Furthermore, TSAM had severe deficiencies in anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns, as most had been sent to Albania, and Bakopoulos' only reinforcements were the units of the Central Macedonia Army Section (TSKM), 19th, 12th and 20th Divisions, which were severely under-manned and equipped with obsolete or captured weapons. The situation was summed up by Papagos,: "We do not expect TSAM to perform miracles, but simply to safeguard the honour of Greece."{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Initial German attacks against the Metaxas Line by mountain troops ([[German 5th Mountain Division|5th]] and [[German 6th Mountain Division|6th]] Mountain Divisions) encountered extremely tough resistance and resulted with limited success. A German report at the end of the first day said that the German 5th Mountain Division "was repulsed in the Rupel Pass despite strongest air support and sustained considerable casualties."<ref>Beevor p. 33</ref>  Historian Christopher Buckley wrote, "Heavy assaults against the Metaxas Line were hurled back with the courage of despair.... The defenders were attacked by wave after wave of infantry, bombed by [[Stuka]]s, shelled without respite by light and heavy artillery.... Assault teams with flame-throwers, hand grenades and explosive charges were engaged and worsted in close quarters fighting."<ref>Buckley p. 50</ref>  After one day of fighting out of the twenty-four forts which made up the Metaxas Line only two had fallen and only after they had been destroyed.<ref>Buckley p. 50</ref> 
[[Image:Greek surrender 1941.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Greek soldiers heading home after the surrender of the Metaxas Line.]]

However effective the resistance of the Metaxas Line was, the Germans found alternate routes of attack. Yugoslav resistance in the north quickly collapsed and German forces poured into Greek territory via Yugoslavia by April 7. The line was quickly outflanked by German [[Panzer]] forces ([[German 2nd Panzer Division|2nd Panzer Division]]) which invaded through southern [[Yugoslavia]] and advanced down the [[Vardar]] Valley where they rapidly defeated the sporadic resistance from the Greek forces of TSKM. On [[April 9]] elements of the 2nd Panzer had reached [[Thessaloniki]], and the remaining Greek forces of the TSAM were reluctantly forced to surrender. Even after General Bakopoulos surrendered the Metaxas Line however, soldiers manning the frontier forts, and some of the field troops, continued to fight on and as a result of this continued resistance, some of the soldiers of the Metaxas line were able to evacuate by sea.<ref>Buckley, p. 61</ref>

===Allied retreat===
[[Image:GreecefightsonBig.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Propaganda poster supporting Greece.]]
W Force had only began to settle in their defensive line when news of the German invasion came. The outcome of initial clashes with the Germans at [[Vevi]] were not encouraging and the rapid advance of the Panzers into [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Prilep]] in Southern [[Yugoslavia]] greatly disturbed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Wilson]]. Wilson was now faced with the prospect of being pinned by the invading Germans operating from [[Thessaloniki]] while being flanked by the German XL Panzer Corps descending through the Monastir Gap. This necessitated a retreat, initially to the [[Aliakmon]] river, and then to the narrow pass at [[Thermopylae]], where the Germans broke through again on April 23.<ref>Hondros, John (1983). Occupation and Resistance: The Greek Agony 1941-44. Pella Pub Co. ISBN 0-918618-19-3 p. 52</ref>

====Vevi====
{{main|Battle of Vevi (1941)}}
On the morning of [[April 10]], the German [[XL Panzer Corps]] advanced from [[Bitola|Monastir]] to   seize the Greek city of [[Florina]], 13 km (8 mi) south of the Yugoslav border, utilising the Monastir Valley (or "Monastir Gap"). The ''[[Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]'' [[brigade]] advanced further south and occupied the town of Vevi on April 11. The Allies decided to attempt a delaying action at the [[Klidi Pass]], just south of Vevi.

[[Image:AWM 007647 vevi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Australian anti-tank gunners resting, soon after their withdrawal from the Vevi area.]]A mixed Commonwealth-Greek formation, known as Mackay Force, was assembled to, as Wilson put it, "....stop a [[Blitzkrieg]] down the Florina Valley."<ref>[http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/greatrisk/greatrisk05.html Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), 2001, "The roof is leaking: Vevi and Sotir 9–14 April 1941".] Downloaded 9/10/06. </ref> The force was named after its leader, the Australian Maj. Gen. [[Iven Giffard Mackay|Iven Mackay]]. The units at the Klidi Pass itself were the [[Australian 6th Division|Australian 19th Infantry Brigade]] minus one battalion, which was replaced by a British battalion, from the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]]. The infantry were supported by some Australian and British artillery crews, and New Zealand machine gunners. The other components of Mackay Force were in flanking positions some distance from the pass. By April 11, the three infantry battalions were spread across a 16 km (ten mile) wide front centred on the narrow, winding pass, which had steep and rocky sides.

''[[Kampfgruppe]] Witt'', an ''SS'' [[battle group]] under ''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Fritz Witt]],<ref> ''KG Witt'' was comprised of an infantry battalion, two light machine gun platoons, a heavy machine gun platoon, three [[anti-tank]] platoons, two engineer platoons, a light field [[howitzer]] troop and an [[88mm]] [[Flak]] platoon. [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree.html W.G. McClymont, 1959, ''To Greece: Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War'', Historical Publications Branch, Wellington, New Zealand, p.194] </ref> began a series of probing attacks that afternoon. These were fended away with vigour, but became more aggressive as night closed in. On the morning of April 12, snow lay over 30 cm (one foot) deep on the hillsides and many Allied troops in the high ground were suffering from frostbite.<ref>McClymont, ''ibid'', p.205 and DVA, 2001 ''op. cit. </ref> However, orders had now been issued for an orderly withdrawal to the Aliakmon line that evening. 

The ''SS'' launched their main assault at 8.30 am. Australian forces on the western flank were forced back, but later counter-attacked and regained the crest.<ref> McClymont, ''ibid'', p.205 </ref> However, the British infantry began to withdraw, believing that the Australians were retreating. This opened the pass itself to the Germans. In the late afternoon, the Greek [[Dodecanese Regiment]] began a planned withdrawal in the east, leaving the forces at Klidi further exposed. The arrival of German tanks at 5.30 pm sealed the Allies' defeat at Vevi. The Australian infantry were forced into a chaotic retreat. The Germans claimed 520 prisoners for the loss of 37 dead, 95 wounded and a few taken prisoner. The remainder of Mackay Force regrouped temporarily in the [[Sotir]] area.

===Olympus and Servia passes===
By the morning of [[April 14]], the spearheads of the [[9th Panzer Division]] reached [[Kozani]] after violent clashes with [[United Kingdom|British]] [[tank]]s and [[anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] guns. That same evening the division established a bridgehead across the Aliakmon River and the Allies fell back to a line which ran near Mt. Olympus. This defense had three main components: the Platamon tunnel area between Olympus and the sea, the Olympus Pass itself, and the [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] Pass south-east. By channelling attack through these three defiles, the new line offered far greater defensive strength for the limited forces available. The defences of the Olympus and Servia passes consisted of the 4th New Zealand Brigade, 5th New Zealand Brigade, and the 16th Australian Brigade. For the next three days the advance of the 9th Panzer Division was stalled in front of these strongly fortified mountain positions.<ref> Smith, p. 94</ref> 

The Platamon tunnel came under attack from German motor cycle troops on [[April 15]], but the Germans were repulsed by the [[New Zealand 2nd Division|21st New Zealand Battalion]] under Colonel Macky, which suffered heavy losses in the process. Later that day a German armoured regiment arrived and struck the coastal and inland flanks of the battalion, but the New Zealanders held their ground. After being reinforced during the night of the 15th-16th, the Germans managed to assemble a tank battalion, infantry battalion, and a battalion of motor cycle troops. The German infantry attacked the New Zealanders left company at dawn, while the tanks attacked along the coast several hours later. Macky, who had lost communications with the company on his left, and had two companies farther down the hill being fired upon from the flank and the rear, gave the order to retire.<ref> [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf Official Histories – Second World War Australia in the War of 1939–1945.

The withdrawal was covered by the reserve company, which was on a ridge south of that pierced by the tunnel. Macky had intended to hold a new position about one mile south of [[Platamon]], but this was found to be impracticable, and continued the retirement to the mouth of the [[Pinios Gorge]]. Macky was informed that it was "essential to deny the gorge to the enemy till 19th April even if it meant extinction".<ref> [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf Official Histories – Second World War Australia in the War of 1939–1945.

The 21st battalion was reinforced  by the [[2/2nd Australian Infantry Battalion|Australian 2/2nd Battalion]] and later by the [[2/3rd Australian Infantry Battalion|2/3rd]], this force became known as ''Allen force'' after Maj General [[Arthur Samuel Allen]]. The [[2/5th Australian Infantry Battalion|2/5th]] and [[2/11th Australian Infantry Battalion|2/11th battalions]] moved to the [[Elatia]] area south-west of the gorge and were ordered to hold the western exit possibly for three or four days.<ref> [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf Official Histories – Second World War Australia in the War of 1939–1945.

On [[April 16]] General Wilson met General Papagos at Lamia and informed him of his decision to withdrawal to [[Thermopylae]]. General Blamney divided responsibility between generals Mackay and [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Freyberg]] during the leapfrogging move back to Thermopylae. Mackay would protect the flanks of the New Zealand Division as far south as an east-west line through Larissa and would control the withdrawal through [[Domokos]] to Thermopylae of ''[[Stanley George Savige|Savige Force]]'' and the Zarkos Force, and finally of Lee Force; the [[British 1st Armoured Brigade|1st Armoured Brigade]] would cover the withdrawal of Savige Force to Larissa and thereafter the withdrawal of the 6th Division under whose command it would come; Freyberg would control the withdrawal of Allen Force which was to move along the same route as the New Zealand Division. The British Commonwealth forces remained under constant attack throughout the entire withdrawal.<ref> [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf Official Histories – Second World War Australia in the War of 1939–1945.

===Withdrawal and surrender of the Greek First Army===
[[Image:1941apr18.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Luftwaffe heavily bombed Allied positions.]]
As the invading Germans advanced deep into Greek territory, the [[Greek First Army]] operating in Albania against the Italians was reluctant to retreat. General Wilson described this reluctance as “the fetishistic doctrine that not a yard of ground should be yielded to the Italians.”<ref>Beevor, p. 39</ref> Because of this reluctance to yield ground to the Italians, the Greek retreat did not materialise until [[April 13]]. The Allied retreat to Thermopylae uncovered a route across the Pindus Mountains by which the Germans might take the Greek army in flank and rear.  An SS regiment was given the mission of cutting off the Greek First Army's line of retreat from Albania by driving westward to the Metsovon Pass, and from there, to Ioannina.<ref>Bailey, p. 32</ref>

Greek commander in chief, Alexandros Papagos, rushed Greek units to the Metsovon Pass, where the Germans were expected to attack. On April 18, a pitched battle between several Greek units and the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade developed there. The Greek units fought bravely, but lacked equipment necessary to fight against a motorised unit, and were soon encircled and overwhelmed. The Germans advanced further and captured Ioannina on [[April 19]], the final supply route of the Greek First Army.<ref>Smith, p. 95</ref> Newspapers around the world dubbed the Greek army's fate as a modern day [[Greek tragedy]]. Historian and former war-correspondent, Christopher Buckley, when describing the fate of the Greek army, writes, "...one experiences a genuine Aristotelian ''Katharsis'', an awe-inspiring sense of the futility of all human effort and all human courage..."<ref>Buckley, p. 113</ref>

On April 20, the commander of the Greek forces in Albania, General [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]] offered his surrender to the advancing Germans. World War II historian [[John Keegan]] writes that Tsolakoglou "was so determined, however, to deny the Italians the satisfaction of a victory they had not earned that, once the hopelessness of his position became apparent to him, he opened quite unauthorised parley with the commander of the German SS division opposite him, [[Sepp Dietrich]], to arrange a surrender to the Germans alone."<ref>Keegan, p. 157</ref> The original surrender document did not include the Italians. Outraged by this decision, Mussolini ordered counterattacks against the Greek forces which had just surrendered, and to Mussolini's embarrassment, these counterattacks were repulsed. It took personal representation from Mussolini to Hitler to bring about an armistice in which Italy was included on [[April 23]].<ref>Keegan, P. 158</ref> In recognition of the valour displayed by Greek forces, the enlisted men were allowed to return to their homes (rather than being confined to POW camps) and officers were permitted to retain their sidearms.<ref>Hondros, p. 90</ref>

On the same day that Tsolakoglou offered his surrender, the [[Bulgarian Army]] entered the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region.  The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Eastern Macedonia]].  The Bulgarians occupied territory between the [[Struma River]] and a line of demarcation running through [[Alexandroupoli]] and [[Svilengrad]] west of [[Maritsa]].  Included in the area occupied were the cities of Alexandroupoli (''Дедеагач, Dedeagach''),  [[Komotini]] (''Гюмюрджина, Gyumyurdzhina''), [[Serres]] (''Сяр, Syar''), [[Xanthi]] (''Ксанти''), [[Drama, Greece|Drama]] (''Драма'') and [[Kavala]] (''Кавала'') and the islands of [[Thasos]] and [[Samothrace]], as well as almost all of what is today the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and much of eastern [[Serbia]].

===Thermopylae position===
[[Image:1941apr24.jpg|thumb|right|250px|German soldiers at Thermopylae after Allied retreat.]]
Following the retreat from the Olympus and Servia passes the British Commonwealth forces began to set up defensive position at the historic pass at Thermopylae (Thermopylae is famous for the [[300 Spartans]] under [[Leonidas|King Leonidas]] who fought to the death against a gigantic [[Persian Empire|Persian]] army in 480 BC). [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|General Bernard Freyberg]] was given the task of defending the coastal pass with [[Iven Giffard Mackay|Mackay]] defending the village of [[Brallos]]. In the New Zealand sector the 5th Brigade was deployed along the coastal road, the foothills south of [[Lamia]], and the [[Spercheios River]]. The 4th Brigade was on the right where it had established coast-watching patrols, and the 6th was in reserve. In the Australian sector the 19th Brigade, comprising the [[2/4th Australian Infantry Battalion|2/4th]] and [[2/8th Australian Infantry Battalion|1/8th Battalions]], defended Brallos.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf Official Histories – Second World War Australia in the War of 1939–1945.

When the order to retreat was received on the morning of the 23rd it was decided that each of the two positions was to be held by one brigade each. These brigades, the Australian 19th and 6th New Zealand were to hold the passes as long as possible, allowing the other units to withdraw. General Vasey, commander of the 19th Brigade said{{cquote|Here we bloody well are and here we bloody well stay<ref> [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf Official Histories – Second World War Australia in the War of 1939–1945.

The Allies held out the entire day. With the delaying action accomplished, they retreated in the direction of the evacuation beaches and set up another rearguard at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]].<ref>Bailey, p. 33</ref>

=== German airborne attack on the Isthmus of Corinth ===
[[Image:OpérationaérienneCorinthe.jpg|thumb|right|220px|German airborne operation on Corinth]]
[[Image:Corinth canal during battle of greece.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Explosion at Corinth Canal.]]
After the Thermopylae position was forced, the Germans staged an airborne operation to seize the bridges over the [[Corinth Canal]], with the double aim of both cutting off the British line of retreat, and securing their own way across the [[Isthmus of Corinth|isthmus]]. The attack, carried out by the 2nd Regiment of [[German 1st Fallschirmjäger Division|1st Fallschirmjäger Division]] on April 26, met with initial success, until a stray British shell ignited the disconnected demolition charges, destroying the bridge and causing several casualties.<ref>Smith, p. 108</ref> Although German engineers managed to construct a temporary bridge within hours, over which 5th Panzer division crossed to the [[Peloponnese]], the attack came a few days too late to cut off the bulk of the British troops in Central Greece, but did manage to isolate the Australian 16th and 17th Brigades.<ref>Macdougall Pg. 195</ref> By the time the isthmus was secured, most Allied units had already begun to evacuate from the town of [[Kalamata]] and other small harbours.

===Athens Falls===
On [[April 27]], [[1941]], German [[motorcycle]] troops entered the Greek capital Athens, followed by [[armoured cars]], [[tank]]s, and [[infantry]]. The people of Athens had been expecting the Germans to enter the city for several days and kept themselves confined to their homes with their windows shut. The previous night Athens Radio had made the following announcement:

[[Image:Akropolis german flag.jpg|thumb|right|250px|German soldiers raising the [[Reichskriegsflagge|Reich War Flag]] over the Acropolis. It would be taken down in acts of resistance throughout the occupation.]]

<blockquote>
You are listening to the voice of Greece. Greeks, stand firm, proud, and dignified. You must prove yourselves worthy of your history. The valour and victory of our army has already been recognised. The righteousness of our cause will also be recognised. We did our duty honestly. Friends! Have Greece in your hearts, live inspired with the fire of her latest triumph and the glory of our army. Greece will live again and will be great, because she fought honestly for a just cause and for freedom. Brothers! Have courage and patience. Be stouthearted. We will overcome these hardships. Greeks! With Greece in your minds you must be proud and dignified. We have been an honest nation and brave soldiers.<ref>Hadjipateras and Fafalios, p. 248-249</ref>
</blockquote>

The German motorcycle troops drove straight to the [[Acropolis]] and raised the [[Nazi]] flag. In the days that followed, the people of Athens, and newspapers around the World, told different stories of the raising of the German flag. According to the most popular account, the [[Evzones|Evzone]] soldier on guard duty, Konstantinos Koukidis, took down the [[Greek flag]], wrapped himself in it, and jumped off the Acropolis. Whether the story was true or not, many Greeks believed the story and looked at the soldier as a [[martyr]].<ref>Bailey, p. 33</ref>

=== Evacuation ===
After some brief holding actions on the [[Peloponnese]], the Greek and British Commonwealth forces had to be evacuated to [[Crete]] and [[Egypt]]. The 5th New Zealand Brigade was evacuated on the night of 24 April, while the 4th New Zealand Brigade remained to block to narrow road to Athens, which was dubbed the ''24 Hour Pass'' by the New Zealanders.<ref>Macdougall pg. 194</ref> On [[25 April]], ([[Anzac Day]]) some 5500 Australian troops of the Australian 19th Brigade were evacuated from the beaches at [[Nauplion]] by [[HMAS Perth (D29)|HMAS Perth]], [[HMAS Stuart (D-00/100)|Stuart]] and [[HMAS Voyager (D31)|Voyager]].<ref>Macdougall pg. 195</ref> The evacuation of about 43,000 soldiers was completed on [[April 28]], but was heavily contested by the German [[Luftwaffe]], which managed to sink at least twenty-six troop-laden ships. The Germans managed to capture around 8,000 Commonwealth and Yugoslav troops who had not been evacuated, while liberating many Italian prisoners from POW camps.<ref>Smith, p. 112</ref>

===Battle of Crete===
''Main Article: [[Battle of Crete]]''

[[Image:Paratroopers Crete '41.JPG|thumb|right|250px|German invasion of Crete. Heavy losses were suffered by the parachutists.]]
Following the occupation of the mainland, Nazi Germany invaded the Greek island of [[Crete]] on [[May 20]], 1941. In the bitterly contested [[Battle of Crete]], the Germans employed parachute forces in a massive airborne invasion. The Germans attacked the three main airfields of the island of [[Maleme]], [[Rethimnon]], and [[Heraklion]]. The Germans met surprising resistance from the Greek, British, Australian, and New Zealand troops on the island and from local civilians. After one day of fighting, none of the objectives were reached and the Germans had suffered around 4,000 casualties.<ref>Bailey, P. 54</ref> German plans were in disarray and Commanding General [[Kurt Student]] was contemplating suicide.

During the next day, through miscommunication and failure of Allied commanders to grasp the situation, Maleme airfield in western Crete fell to the Germans. With Maleme airfield secure, the Germans flew in thousands of reinforcements and overwhelmed the western side of the island. After seven days of fighting Allied commanders realised that so many Germans had been flown in that hope of Allied victory was gone. By [[June 1]], [[1941]], the evacuation of Crete by the Allies was complete and the island was under German occupation. In light of the heavy casualties suffered by the elite [[German 7th Flieger Division|7th Flieger Division]], Adolf Hitler forbade further airborne operations.<ref>Beevor, P. 231</ref> General Kurt Student would dub Crete "the graveyard of the German paratroopers" and a "disastrous victory."<ref> Antony. Crete: The Battle and the Resistance, John Murray Ltd, 1991. Penguin Books, 1992. Boulder : Westview Press, 1994.  Pbk ISBN 0-14-016787-0 p. 231</ref>

==Evaluation==
The speed of the German tank movements through the rugged Balkan Mountains and the efficiency of the campaign amazed military men around the world. At the same time, the Greek and Allied troops gave, what many historians such as John Keegan and Antony Beevor believe, an astonishingly effective resistance given their limited resources. Historian John Keegan writes "The Greek campaign had been an old-fashioned gentlemens's war, with honour given and accepted by brave adversaries on each side."<ref>Keegan, p. 158</ref> Keegan also writes that the Greek and Allied forces, being vastly outnumbered, "had, rightly, the sensation of having fought the good fight."<ref>Keegan, p. 158</ref> 

The overall German casualties in the Battle of Greece, as they were officially announced by Germany after the end of the operation, are roughly 5,000 men including 1,100 dead. The actual losses, as they are estimated are 11,500, with 2,500 dead. The Allied expeditionary force lost approximately a quarter (14,500) of its 58,000 strength including 11,000 captured, and Greece was effectively forced out of the war, although a vigorous resistance movement lasted throughout the [[Axis Occupation of Greece during WWII|Axis occupation]]. Italian casualties were far heavier and amounted to over 100,000 as a result of their six month fight with Greece.<ref> Collier, Richard (1971). Duce!. Viking Adult. ISBN 0-670-28603-6 p. 180</ref>

==Effect on World War II==
Greek resistance in World War II may have been a turning point in the war. Some historians such as [[John Keegan]] believe that the German invasion of Greece delayed the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] by six weeks. Hitler planned the invasion of the Soviet Union to take place on [[May 15]], [[1941]] but it was not until [[June 22]], [[1941]] when the invasion was launched. This delay proved costly as it forced the Axis Powers to fight through the Russian Winter. The German army was unable to capture [[Moscow]] and its advance towards the Caucasus was delayed as a result. Adolf Hitler in conversation with [[Leni Riefenstahl]] would bitterly say that "if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed our help, the war would have taken a different course. We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow. There would have been no [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]".<ref>Leni Riefenstahl, ''Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir.'' (Picador New York, USA. 1987) p. 295 ISBN 0-312-11926-7</ref>

The [[Axis Occupation of Greece]], which came as a result of the Battle of Greece, proved to be a difficult and costly task. The occupation led to the creation of several resistance groups. These resistance groups launched guerilla attacks against the occupying forces and set up espionage networks. The vigorous resistance movement forced the Axis Powers to station hundreds of thousands of soldiers in Greece, when those soldiers could have been better used elsewhere. Famous acts of resistance include the taking down of the Nazi flag off the Acropolis by [[Manolis Glezos]] and [[Apostolos Santas]] and the destruction of the railway bridge over the [[Gorgopotamos]] gorge. Greek civilians suffered terrible hardships as a result of the brutal occupation. From 1940 to 1945 Greece counted, according to Russian historian Vadim Erlikman, 435,000 casualties.<ref> Vadim Erlikman. ''Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke'' : spravochnik. Moscow 2004. ISBN 5-93165-107-1.</ref>

At the same time, the politically-motivated decision to send British forces into Greece is considered, in the words of General [[Alan Brooke]], "a definite strategic blunder", as it denied [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Wavell]] the necessary reserves to complete the conquest of [[History of Libya as Italian Colony|Italian-held Libya]] after [[Operation Compass]], or to successfully withstand [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[Afrika Korps]] March offensive, while being totally inadequate to prevent the collapse of Greece. Thereby it arguably prolonged the [[North African Campaign]], which otherwise might have been successfully concluded within [[1941]].

==Homage to the Greek resistance==
[[Image:World war ii era greek comic.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Cartoon picturing Greek soldier.]]
The measure of resistance was paid considerable homage to by German officials.  Hitler's Chief of Staff, Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]]  stated during the [[Nuremberg Trials]], "the unbelievably strong resistance of the Greeks delayed by two or more vital months the German attack against Russia; if we did not have this long delay, the outcome of the war would have been different in the eastern front and in the war in general."<ref>[http://hellenicnews.com/readnews.html?newsid=5696&lang=US Lest we forget the 28th of October of 1940, by Peter N. Yiannos, Ph.D]</ref> Adolf Hitler ordered that no Greek soldier shall be taken prisoner and that those who were, were to be released immediately out of respect of their bravery.<ref>[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/4_May%2C_1941 Adolf Hitler's speech to the Reichstag on May 4, 1941]accessed October 10, 2006</ref>

A speech [[Adolf Hitler]] made at the Reichstag in 1941 said of the campaign: "It must be said, for the sake of historical truth, that amongst all our opponents, only the Greeks fought with such endless courage and defiance of death."<ref>[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/4_May%2C_1941 Adolf Hitler's speech to the Reichstag on May 4, 1941]</ref> The diary of [[Joseph Goebbels]] 9 April 1941: "I forbid the Press to underestimate the Greeks, to defame them....

The measure of Greek resistance was paid homage and aroused admiration around the world. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] would say "until now we would say that the Greeks fight like heroes. From now on we will say that heroes fight like Greeks."<ref> [http://www.greece.org:8080/opencms/opencms/HEC_Projects/OXI/OXI-SEVEN.en.pdf Reflections on the 65th Anniversary of the day Greece answered no and once again changed the course of history, by Chris P.

We will never forget."<ref> [http://www.greece.org:8080/opencms/opencms/HEC_Projects/OXI/OXI-SEVEN.en.pdf Reflections on the 65th Anniversary of the day Greece answered no and once again changed the course of history, by Chris P.
