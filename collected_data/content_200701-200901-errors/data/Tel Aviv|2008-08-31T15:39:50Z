Tel Aviv was founded in 1909 on the outskirts of the ancient port city of [[Jaffa]] ({{lang-he-n|יָפוֹ}}, ''Yafo''). The growth of Tel Aviv soon outpaced Jaffa, which was largely Arab at the time. Tel Aviv and Jaffa were merged into a single municipality in 1950, two years after the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|establishment of the State of Israel]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Tel Aviv'' (literally "Hill of Spring") was chosen in 1910 from many suggestions, among them "Herzliya". ''Tel Aviv'' is the Hebrew title of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s book [[The Old New Land|''Altneuland'']] ("Old New Land"), translated from [[German language|German]] by [[Nahum Sokolow]]. Sokolow took the name from the [[Book of Ezekiel]]: "Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the [[Khabur River|river Chebar]], and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days."<ref>[[Book of Ezekiel]] 3:15</ref> This name was found fitting as it embraced the idea of the renaissance of the ancient Jewish homeland. ''Aviv'' is Hebrew for "spring", symbolizing renewal, and ''tel'' is an archaeological site that reveals layers of civilization built one over the other.<ref name="VTLV">{{citeweb |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/Telaviv.html |title=Tel Aviv |accessdate=2007-07-18 |publisher=''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]''}}</ref> Theories vary about the etymology of Jaffa or ''Yafo'' in Hebrew. Some believe that the name derives from ''yafah'' or ''yofi'', Hebrew for "beautiful" or "beauty". Another tradition is that [[Japheth]], son of [[Noah]], founded the city and that it was named for him.

===Jaffa===
{{see|Jaffa}}
[[Image:Yafo.jpg|thumb|widthpx|The Jaffa port.]]
Jaffa is an ancient port and has changed hands many times in the course of history. A series of [[excavation|archeological excavations]], between 1955 and 1974, revealed traces of towers and gates from the [[Bronze age|Middle Bronze Age]].<ref name="TAU">{{citeweb |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/archaeology/projects/proj_jaffa.html |title=Excavations at Ancient Jaffa (Joppa) |accessdate=2008-03-30 |publisher=Tel Aviv University}}</ref> Subsequent excavations, from 1997 onwards, helped date earlier discoveries.<ref name="TAU"/> They also exposed sections of a packed-sandstone [[glacis]] and a "massive brick wall", dating from the [[Bronze age|Late Bronze Age]] as well as a temple "attributed to the [[Sea Peoples]]" and dwellings from the [[Iron Age]].<ref name="TAU"/> Remnants of buildings from the [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic]] periods were also discovered.<ref name="TAU"/>

The city is first mentioned in letters from 1470 BCE that record its conquest by Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Thutmose III]].<ref name="Economist"/> Jaffa is mentioned several times in the [[Bible]], as the port from which [[Jonah]] set sail for [[Tarshish]];<ref>[[Book of Jonah]] 1:3</ref> as bordering on the territory of the [[Tribe of Dan]];<ref>[[Book of Joshua]] 19:40–48</ref> and as the port at which the wood for [[Solomon's Temple]] in Jerusalem arrived from Lebanon.<ref>[[Books of Chronicles]] II 2:15</ref>

In 1099, the Christian armies of the [[First Crusade]], led by [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] occupied Jaffa, which had been abandoned by the Muslims, fortified the town and improved its harbor.<ref>{{citebook |title=A History of the Crusades Vol 1: The First Crusade |last=Runciman|first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Runciman |publisher=Penguin|date=1951|location=London |pages=282, 308 |isbn=978-0-14-013706-4 }}</ref> As the [[Count]]y of Jaffa, the town soon become important as the main sea supply route for the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].<ref>{{citebook |title=A History of the Crusades Vol 2: The Kingdom of Jerusalem|last=Runciman|first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Runciman|publisher=Penguin|date=1952|location=London |pages=191&ndash;92 |isbn=978-0-140-13704-0}}</ref> Jaffa was captured by [[Saladin]] in 1192 but swiftly re-taken by [[Richard I of England|Richard Coeur de Lion]], who added to its defenses.<ref name =RuncimanV3>{{citebook |title=A History of the Crusades Vol 3: The Kingdom of Acre|last=Runciman|first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Runciman |publisher=Penguin|date=1954|location=London |pages=70&ndash;71, 186, 324 |isbn=978-0-140-13705-7}}</ref> In 1223, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] added further fortications.<ref name =RuncimanV3/> Crusader domination ended in 1268, when the [[Mamluk]] Sultan [[Baibars]] captured the town, destroyed its harbor and razed its fortifications.<ref name =RuncimanV3/><ref name="Kark">{{citebook |title=Jaffa: A City in Evolution 1799–1917|last=Kark |first=Ruth |publisher=Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi|date=1990|location=Jerusalem|pages=8-10 |isbn=978-9652170651}}</ref> To prevent further Crusader incursions, the city was ransacked in 1336, 1344 and 1346 by [[Nasir al-Din Muhammad]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=New Light on the History of Jaffa |publisher=Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society 5:82-84 |first=S. |last=Tolkovsky |date=1925|location=London}}</ref> In the 16th&nbsp;century, Jaffa was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and was administered as a village in the [[sanjak]] of Gaza.<ref name="Kark"/> According to some sources it has been a port for at least 4,000&nbsp;years,<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/geo/jaffa.html |title=Jaffa |accessdate=2008-02-11 |publisher=''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]''}}</ref> [[Napoleon]] besieged the city in 1799 and killed scores of inhabitants; a plague epidemic followed, decimating the remaining population.<ref name="Kark"/>

[[Image:TelAviv-Founding.jpg|thumb|left|Tel Aviv was founded on land purchased from Bedouins north of Jaffa. This photograph is of the 1909 auction of the first lots.]]

During the 1880s, Ashkenazi immigration to Jaffa increased with the onset of the [[First Aliyah]].

===Urban development===
[[Image:TelAviv-paam4.jpg|thumb|Early Tel Aviv]]
The [[Second Aliyah]] led to further expansion.<ref name="Economist" /> In 1906, a group of Jews, among them residents of Jaffa, banded together to build a new [[:Category:Garden suburbs|garden suburb]] on the outskirts of Jaffa.<ref name="JewishVL>{{citeweb |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/geo/tahist.html |title=From Spring Hill to Independence |publisher=''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]'' |accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref> The goal of the ''[[Ahuzat Bayit]]'' (lit.

[[Meir Dizengoff]], who later became Tel Aviv's first mayor, was a member of Ahuzat Bayit.<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/BIOS/dizen.html |title=Dizengoff, Meir |publisher=[[Jewish Agency]] |accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Bridger |first=David |authorlink= |title=The New Jewish Encyclopedia |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |date=1906 |pages=117 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hZqpCrG3qw0C&pg=PA117&dq=founder+tel-aviv&sig=W_o3jcb3qX5frlmTU2tNfJhNqGo |isbn=}}</ref> His vision for Tel Aviv involved peaceful co-existence with the Arabs.<ref name="Economist" />

===Under the British Mandate===
[[Image:Rothschild Blvd. 4.jpg|thumb|230px|Evening scene at [[Rothschild Boulevard]], one of Tel Aviv's historic streets]]

Under [[British Mandate of Palestine|British administration]], the political friction between Jews and Arabs in [[Palestine]] increased.<br> On [[May 1]] [[1921]], the [[Jaffa Riots]] erupted and an Arab mob killed dozens of Jewish residents. In the wake of this violence, many Jews left Jaffa for Tel Aviv, increasing the population of Tel Aviv from 2,000 in 1920 to 34,000 by 1925.<ref name="UNESCO" /><ref name="population">{{citeweb |url=http://www.travelnet.co.il/israel/TelAviv/History.htm |title=Tel Aviv History |accessdate=2008-01-20 |publisher=Travelnet.co.il}}</ref> New businesses opened in Tel Aviv, leading to the decline of Jaffa as a commercial center.<ref name="JewishVL" />  In 1925, [[Patrick Geddes]] drew up a [[Urban planning|master plan]] for Tel Aviv that was adopted by the city council led by [[Meir Dizengoff]].<ref name="Economist" /> The core idea was the development of a [[Garden City]]. The boundaries he worked within, the Yarkon River in the North and Ibn Gvirol Street in the East, are still regarded as Tel Aviv's real city limits although it has since grown beyond them.<ref name="arch">{{citeweb |url=http://mjwein.net/lectures/T-Lec-WhiteCity.pdf |title=Green, White or Black City? |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-03-16 |date=2006 |publisher=Martin Wein, Emory University}}</ref>

Tel Aviv continued to grow in 1926 but suffered an economic setback between 1927 and 1930.<ref name="JewishVL" /><ref name="Economist" /> At the same time, cultural life was given a boost by the establishment of the Ohel Theater and the decision of [[Habima Theatre]] to make Tel Aviv its permanent base in 1931.<ref name="JewishVL" /> Tel Aviv gained municipal status in 1934.<ref name="JewishVL" />

The population rose dramatically during the [[Fifth Aliyah]] when the Nazis came to power in Germany.<ref name="JewishVL" /> As the Jews fled Europe, many settled in Tel Aviv, bringing the population in 1937 to 150,000, compared to Jaffa's 69,000&nbsp;residents. Within two years, it had reached 160,000, which was over a third of the country's total Jewish population.<ref name="JewishVL" /> Many new immigrants remained after disembarking in Jaffa, turning the city into a center of urban life. In the wake of the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936&ndash;39 Arab rioting]], a local port independent of Jaffa was built in 1938, and [[Lod Airport]] (later Ben Gurion Airport) and [[Sde Dov Airport]] opened between 1937 and 1938.<ref name="Economist" />
[[Image:OldcityhallS.jpg|thumb|left|Historic Tel Aviv town hall and [[Nahum Gutman]] fountain on [[Bialik]] Street]]
Tel Aviv's [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]], now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], emerged in the 1930s. Many of the German Jewish architects trained at the [[Bauhaus]], the [[Modernist]] school of architecture closed by the Nazis in 1933, fled Germany. Some came to Palestine and adapted the architectural outlook of the Bauhaus as well as other similar schools, to local conditions, creating what is claimed to be the largest concentration of buildings in the [[International Style]] in the world.<ref name="Economist" /><ref name="UNESCO" />

According to the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|1947 UN Partition Plan]] that proposed dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, Tel Aviv, by then a city of 230,000, was slated for inclusion in the Jewish state. Jaffa with, as of 1945, a population of 101,580 people, 53,930 of whom were Muslim and 16,800 Christian, making up the Arab population, and 30,820 Jewish, was designated as part of the Arab state.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.palestineremembered.com/Acre/Maps/Story574.html |title=Supplement to a Survey of Palestine |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref> The Arabs, however, rejected the partition plan.<ref name="Economist" /> Between 1947 and 1948, tensions grew on the border between Tel Aviv and Jaffa, with Arab snipers firing at Jews from the minaret of the local mosque. The [[Haganah]] and [[Irgun]] retaliated with a siege on Jaffa.<ref name="Economist" /> From  April 1948, the Arab residents began to leave. When Jaffa was conquered by Israeli forces on [[May 14]], few remained.<ref name="Economist" />

===After Israeli independence===

By the time of Israel's [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Declaration of Independence]] on [[May 14]] [[1948]], the population of Tel Aviv had risen to more than 200,000.<ref name="population" />
Tel Aviv was the temporary capital of the State of Israel until the government moved to Jerusalem in December 1949.  However, due to the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most foreign embassies remained in or near Tel Aviv.<ref name="VTLV" /> In the early 1980s, 13 embassies in Jerusalem moved to Tel Aviv as part of the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478|UN's measures]] responding to Israel's 1980 [[Jerusalem Law]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1979-1980/119%20Foreign%20Ministry%20reaction%20to%20the%20transfer%20of%20t |title=Foreign Ministry reaction to the transfer of the Dutch embassy from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv |date=1980-08-26 |accessdate=2007-06-03 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |work=Israel's Foreign Relations: Selected Documents}}</ref> Today, all but two of the national embassies are in Tel Aviv or the surrounding district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.science.co.il/Embassies.asp|title=Embassies and Consulates in Israel |accessdate=2007-07-18 |publisher=Israel Science and Technology |work=Israel Science and Technology Homepage}}</ref> In April 1949, Tel Aviv and Jaffa were united in the single municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo, and the lands of neighboring villages such as [[al-Shaykh Muwannis]], Jammasin and Sumail, which had been depopulated during the war, were incorporated into the municipality.<ref name="EJ">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Tel Aviv-Jaffa |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]] |url=http://www.encyclopaediajudaica.com/efiles/TelAviv.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref> Tel Aviv thus grew to {{convert|42|km2|sqmi|sp=us|1}}.

== Geography==
[[Image:DSC 0061.jpg|A street in city center|thumb|220px]]
Tel Aviv is located around {{coor dm|32|5|N|34|48|E|}} on the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain]], the [[Via Maris|historic land bridge]] between Europe, Africa, and Asia. Immediately north of the ancient port of Jaffa, Tel Aviv lies on land that used to be sand dunes and as such has relatively poor soil fertility. The land has been flattened and has no important gradients; its most notable geographical features are bluffs above the Mediterranean coastline and the [[Yarkon River]] mouth.<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Aliyah/About+Israel/Cities/Tel+Aviv.htm |title=Tel Aviv |publisher=[[Jewish Agency]] |accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> Because of the expansion of Tel Aviv and the Gush Dan region, absolute borders between Tel Aviv and Jaffa and between the city's neighborhoods do not exist. The city is  {{convert|60|km|mi|0|sp=us}} northwest of Jerusalem and {{convert|90|km|mi|0|sp=us}} south of the northern port city of [[Haifa]].<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distances.html?n=676 |title=Cities located close to Tel Aviv |accessdate=2008-01-26 |publisher=TimeandDate.com}}</ref> Neighboring cities and towns include [[Herzliya]] to the north, [[Ramat HaSharon]] to the northeast, [[Ramat Gan]] and [[Giv'atayim]] to the east, [[Holon]] to the southeast, and [[Bat Yam]] to the south.<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.science.co.il/Israel-map-Carta.asp |title=Map of Israel |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=Carta}}</ref> The city is economically stratified between the north and south. South Tel Aviv is generally poor, with the exception of the [[Neve Tzedek]] neighborhood and some recent development by the [[Jaffa]] beach. It also includes the city's "[[downtown]]." Central Tel Aviv includes Tel Aviv's [[Azrieli Center]] and is also an important financial and commerce district that stretches along the part of [[Ramat Gan]] on the [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway]]. The northern side of Tel Aviv is home to [[Tel Aviv University]] and some of Tel Aviv's most expensive [[upper class]] residential neighborhoods. The prosperity of the north stretches to neighboring [[Herzliya Pituah]], [[Ramat HaSharon]], and [[Kfar Shmaryahu]].<ref name=yarkoni>{{cite web

===Climate===
Tel Aviv has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with hot summers, pleasant springs and autumns, and cool, wet winters ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). Humidity tends to be high year-round due to the city's proximity to the sea. In winter, temperatures seldom drop below {{convert|5|°C|°F|sigfig=2}} and are usually between {{convert|10|°C|°F|sigfig=2}} and {{convert|15|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}; the city has not seen proper snow since 1950.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/U14836571826303N.pdf |title=The Distribution of Snow in Israel |accessdate=2008-02-13 |journal=GeoJournal}}</ref> In summer the average is {{convert|26|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}, and often daytime temperatures exceed {{convert|32|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}. Despite the high humidity, precipitation during summertime is rare. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|530|mm|in|sp=us|1}}, usually concentrated in the period October to April.<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.wordtravels.com/Cities/Israel/Tel+Aviv/Climate |title=Tel Aviv Climate and Weather |publisher=World Travels |accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref> Tel Aviv experiences on average more than 300&nbsp;sunny days a year.

===Districts===
{{see|Neighborhoods of Tel Aviv}}
[[Image:Old yaffo 3.JPG|thumb|widthpx|Tel Aviv viewed from Old Jaffa.]]
Tel Aviv is made up of nine districts that have formed naturally over the city's short history. The most notable of these is Jaffa, the ancient port city out of which Tel Aviv grew. This area is traditionally made up demographically of a greater percentage of Arabs, but recent [[gentrification]] is replacing them with a young professional population. Similar processes are occurring in nearby [[Neve Tzedek]], the original Jewish neighborhood outside of Jaffa. [[Ramat Aviv]], a neighborhood in the northern part of the city largely made up of luxury apartments and including the Tel Aviv University, is currently undergoing extensive expansion and is set to absorb the beachfront property of Sde Dov Airport after its decommissioning.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3420369,00.html |title=Tel Aviv airport to make way for luxury project |accessdate=2007-07-03 |date=2007-07-03 |last=Petersburg |first=Ofer |work=Ynetnews}}</ref> This will likely take several years while expansion north of the airport makes up the majority of the city's growth.

Historically, there was a demographic split between the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] north of the city, including the neighborhood of Ramat Aviv, and the southern, more [[Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi]] neighborhoods including Neve Tzedek and [[Florentine, Tel Aviv|Florentin]].<ref name="Economist" />

Since the 1980s, however, restoration and gentrification has taken place on a large scale in the southern neighborhoods, making them some of the city’s most desirable neighborhoods for the more prosperous north Tel Avivis.<ref name="Economist" /> In north Tel Aviv, the old port area, which had become run-down since the port was decommissioned in 1965, also saw an urban revival, becoming an upmarket area with shops and restaurants.<ref name="Economist" />

==Architecture==
{{See|White City (Tel Aviv)|:Category:Buildings and structures in Tel Aviv}}
[[Image:Rothschild1.jpg|Bauhaus structure on Rothschild Boulevard|thumb|200px]]
The early architecture of Tel Aviv consisted largely of Eastern European-style single-story houses with red-tiled roofs.<ref name="arch" /> Neve Tzedek, the first neighborhood to be constructed outside of Jaffa is characterised by two-story sandstone buildings.<ref name="UNESCO" /> By the 1920s, a new eclectic Orientalist style came into vogue, combining European architecture with Middle Eastern features such as arches, domes and ornamental tiles.<ref name="arch" /> Municipal construction followed the "garden city"  master plan drawn up by [[Patrick Geddes]]. Two- and three-story buildings were interspersed with boulevards and public parks.<ref name="arch" /> [[Bauhaus]] architecture was introduced in the 1920s and 1930s by German Jewish architects who settled in Palestine after the rise of the Nazis. Tel Aviv's [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]], in north Tel Aviv, contains more than 5,000&nbsp;Modernist-style buildings inspired by the [[Bauhaus]] school and [[Le Corbusier]].<ref name="UNESCO" /><ref name="times" /> Construction of these buildings, later declared protected landmarks and, collectively, a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site, continued until the 1950s in the area around [[Rothschild Boulevard]].<ref name="times" /><ref>{{citeweb |url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=1096 |title=White City of Tel Aviv |accessdate=2007-07-19 |publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}</ref> Three thousand buildings were created in this style between 1931 and 1939 alone.<ref name="arch" />
[[Image:Azrieli Towers Sept.2007.JPG|left|[[Azrieli Center]]|thumb]]
In the 1960s, this architectural style gave way to office towers and a chain of waterfront hotels and commercial skyscrapers.<ref name="Economist" /> Some of the city's Modernist buildings were neglected to the point of ruin. Before legislation to preserve this landmark architecture, many of the old buildings were demolished. In recent years, efforts have been made to refurbish Bauhaus buildings and restore them to their original condition.<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/Architecture/Bauhaus.html |title=Bauhaus Architecture |publisher=''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]'' |accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> In recent years, Tel Aviv has become a hub of modern [[high-rise]] architecture due to the soaring price of real-estate in the city. The [[Shalom Meir Tower]], Israel's first skyscraper, was built in Tel Aviv in 1965 and remained the country's tallest building until 1999. The [[Azrieli Center]], composed of three buildings&mdash; one square, one triangular, and one circular&mdash;usurped that title. Since 2001, Israel's tallest building is the [[Moshe Aviv Tower|City Gate Tower]], which is located in the neighboring city of [[Ramat Gan]], although the country's tallest wholly residential building, the [[Neve Tzedek Tower]], is in Tel Aviv. New neighborhoods such as the [[Park Tzameret]] are being constructed to house luxury apartment towers including [[YOO Tel Aviv]] towers designed by [[Philippe Starck]], while zones such as [[Sarona, Palestine|The southern Kirya]] are being developed with office towers. Other recent additions to Tel Aviv's skyline are the [[1 Rothschild Tower]], [[Be'eri Nahardea Tower]] and [[First International Bank Tower]].<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://telavivinf.com/info/infoitems.asp?lang=eng&cat=1&status=completed |title=Tel Aviv Towers|accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=Tel Aviv in Focus}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=948 |title=Tel Aviv |publisher=SkyscraperPage.com |accessdate=2008-03-15]]}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[Image:Ehad Haam stock exchange.JPG|thumb|Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]]
[[Image:Shuk hacarmel.JPG|thumb|Shuk HaCarmel market]]

Since Tel Aviv was built on sand dunes, farming was not profitable and maritime commerce was centered in [[Haifa]] and [[Ashdod]]. Instead, the city gradually developed as a center for scientific and technical research. In 1974, [[Intel]] opened its first overseas research and development operation in the city, and Tel Aviv emerged as a high-tech center in the 1990s.<ref name="Economist" /> Economic activities in the city account for about 15 percent of national employment and about 17 percent of [[GDP]].<ref name="profile" /> Forty percent of national employment in finance and 25 percent of national employment in business services is in the city.<ref name="profile" />

{{main|Transport in Tel Aviv}}
Tel Aviv is a major transportation hub, with many major routes of the national road network passing through the city. The main highway to Tel Aviv is the [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway (Highway 20)]], which runs along the eastern side of the city from north to south along the Ayalon River riverbed, dividing for the most part Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan. Driving south on the Ayalon gives access to [[Highway 1 (Israel)|Highway 1]], leading to [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and Jerusalem. Within the city, the main routes are King George Street, [[Allenby Street]], [[Ibn Gabirol Street]], [[Dizengoff Street]], [[Rothschild Boulevard]], and in Jaffa the main route is Jerusalem Boulevard. Namir Road connects the city to [[Highway 2 (Israel)|Highway 2]], Israel's main north–south highway, and Begin/Jabotinsky Road, which provides access from the east through Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Petah Tikva. Tel Aviv, accommodating about 500,000&nbsp;commuter cars daily, suffers from increasing congestion. In 2007, the Sadan Report recommended the introduction of a [[Road pricing|congestion charge]] similar to that of [[London]] in Tel Aviv as well as other Israeli cities. Under this plan, road users traveling into the city would pay a fixed fee.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1198517321459 |title=Public transportation to be overhauled |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=2008-08-01 |last=Wrobel |first=Sharon }}</ref> Tel Aviv Municipality is trying to encourage the use of bicycles in the city, aiming to open 100&nbsp;bicycle-rental stations to serve {{convert|74|km|mi|1|sp=us}} of bicycle paths.

Tel Aviv has four [[Israel Railways|train stations]] along the Ayalon Highway. The stops are from north to south: Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv Merkaz, Tel Aviv Hashalom (adjacent to [[Azrieli Center]]) and Tel Aviv Hahaganah (near the [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]]). It is estimated that over a million&nbsp;people travel by train from the surrounding cities to Tel Aviv each month.

The [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]] is in the south of the city. The main bus network in Tel Aviv is operated by [[Dan Bus Company]]; the [[Egged Bus Cooperative]], the world's second-largest bus company, provides intercity transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/11/Facets%20of%20the%20Israeli%20Economy-%20Transportation |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |title=Facets of the Israeli Economy &ndash; Transportation |date=[[2001-11-01]] |last=Solomon |first=Shoshanna |accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref>

Tel Aviv's domestic airport is [[Sde Dov]] in the northwestern part of the city. Sde Dov is slated to close because it occupies prime coastal real estate near the upscale Ramat Aviv neighborhood.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/793988.html |title=Sde Dov to be vacated, state gets half of Big Bloc |accessdate=2007-07-17 |work=[[Haaretz]] |last=Bar-Eli |first=Avi|date=[[2006-11-30]]}}</ref> In the near future all services to Sde Dov will transfer to [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], Israel's main international airport, close to the city of [[Lod]] and {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} southeast of Tel Aviv. Because it is close to Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport is often referred to as ''Tel Aviv International Airport'' even though it is not part of any municipal jurisdiction.

In early 2008, Tel Aviv Municipality announced a pilot scheme to build charging stations for electric cars. Initially, five&nbsp;charging points will be built, and eventually 150&nbsp;points will be set up across the city as part of the Israeli electric car project, [[Project Better Place]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000299280&fid=942 |title=Tel Aviv commits to electric car |accessdate=2008-01-17 |date=2008-01-17 |work=Globes}}</ref> Battery replacement points will be located at the city's entrances.
