Octopus, Thong's partner in crime, is played by Louis Koo, an award winning actor with experience ranging from [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]] drama series ''[[Detective Investigation Files IV]]'' and the film ''[[Election 2]]''. Koo is proud to work with Jackie Chan, describing him as an upright [[perfectionist]] who forbids [[littering]] by crew members in the premises, volunteering to take out the rubbish. Despite sharing the same amount of screen time with Jackie Chan, Koo admitted he was spellbound by Chan's stunts, feeling slightly inconfident acting alongside him.<ref>{{cite web

The Landlord, the leader behind Thongs and Octopus, is played by Michael Hui, a comedian who has starred in various films in the 1980s and 1990s before emigrating to [[Canada]] shortly before the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong]].

''Rob-B-Hood'' features the collaboration between Jackie Chan and [[Yuen Biao]], a fellow member of the [[Seven Little Fortunes]]. Yuen Biao, a close friend of Chan, has co-starred with Chan and [[Sammo Hung]] in a number of action comedy films in the 1980s including ''Project A'', ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' and the ''[[Lucky Stars]]'' trilogy. Chan had originally intended to co-star with both Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung as a reunion of the "Three Brothers". However, the latter declined. Only Yuen Biao appears in the film, playing the role of Police Inspector Mok, a policeman assigned to investigate the baby's disappearance.<ref>{{cite web

It took over 100 auditions to find the suitable baby to star in ''Rob-B-Hood''.<ref name="BC"/> Benny Chan chose Matthew Medvedev, a one year old infant of Chinese and Columbian descent. Medvedev, known as Baby Matthew, was literally recruited off the street when an assistant director spotted him with his parents on the [[MTR]]. Although his family was simply visiting Hong Kong, they agreed to stay and let Matthew appear in ''Rob-B-Hood''.<ref name="The Nation"/>

Benny Chan described the filming process as one of the darkest days of his career, citing the baby to be a factor beyond his control. The baby never did what he was told and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members could not make any noise and had to communicate in [[sign language]]. Benny Chan states it takes time, patience and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went [[Cost overrun|over budget]].<ref name="BC"/> Crude methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into cooperation. One scene required the baby to bite Jackie Chan's [[nipple]]. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of [[honey]] onto the nipple.<ref>{{cite video

The script was modified slightly during filming. One scene required Louis Koo to hug Jackie Chan from behind once they have found the baby, having left him on a bus. In one of the takes, Koo fell onto Chan as he ran for the baby, delivering a brief [[french kiss]] to Jackie Chan. The scene was immediately cut by director Benny Chan. Since the director loved the take, the script was changed on the spot to accommodate it.<ref>{{cite web

Jackie Chan turned 52 on [[April 7]], 2006, a few days before the end of filming. With a tight schedule to keep, Jackie Chan opted to spend his birthday working. However, his crew had planned a [[surprise birthday party]] for several days. During his dinner break, all production staff, including board members of the production company, arrived taking pictures with Jackie Chan, while actor [[Terence Yin]] presented him with two birthday cakes and a roast [[suckling pig]]. Several [[England|English]], [[Australia]]n and [[Japan]]ese fans attended Jackie Chan's birthday party, making the total number of guests exceed 100.<ref>{{cite web

Despite being over 50, Jackie Chan continued his tradition of performing his own stunts in ''Rob-B-Hood'', choreographed by the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]].<ref name = BJN/> Several scenes in the film required Jackie Chan to coordinate his stunts with the baby. They include a car chase around the Sha Tin industrial area, in which Jackie Chan managed to snatch the baby away seconds before a car crashes into him, and a scene in Ocean Park in which Chan climbed on the underside of a [[roller coaster]] with the baby on his back.<ref name="BC"/><ref name="Film">{{cite video

==Plot==
[[Image:Rbh A.JPG|thumb|Octopus, Thongs and the Landlord prepare to kidnap the baby from the mansion.]]
The film begins showing two simultaneous events in a hospital: A burglary committed by Thongs and Octopus, and the birth of a baby boy to the wealthy [[Li (surname)|Lee]] family. Max, the mother's ex-boyfriend snatches the baby, prompting the security guards to pursue Max, ignoring the burglars. After a violent struggle on an escalator, Max and the baby fall over the side, the latter saved by Thongs. While the guards are distracted, Thongs and Octopus leave in the Landlord's [[minivan]].

A few months later, the Landlord lost his life savings following a burglary of his flat. Desperate to regain his fortunes, he accepts a job to kidnap baby Lee on behalf of [[triad society|triads]]. En route to their rendezvous point at [[Sai Kung]], the Landlord crashes their vehicle down a slope in an attempt to evade a police [[road block]]. Per the stuck Landlord's instructions, Thongs and Octopus leave with the baby, bringing him to the Landlord's flat before the police catch up.
 
The Landlord is detained by the police for [[reckless driving]]. Having learnt of the baby's potential value through the news, he phones Thongs, instructing him not to hand the baby over to anyone prior to his release. Over the next few days, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby, developing a strong bond with him. The two begin to regret their vices: Thongs resists the urge to gamble, while Octopus feels sorry for cheating on his wife.

Meanwhile, both the triads and the police are after the baby. The triad boss, enraged by the non-delivery of his "grandson", sends his men to retrieve the baby from Thongs' flat. Having confronted both the triads and the police, led by Inspector Mok, Thongs and Octopus flee with the baby. Having failed to snatch the baby, the triads grab the Landlord as he is released from police custody and brings him to the triad boss, who now offers [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]30 million for the Baby. 

The Landlord finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord shows them the HK$5 million deposit received from the triads, but Thongs and Octopus are more concerned about the baby. The two, however, agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them with the rest of the money. All seems fine, until the three see the nurses taking a blood sample from the baby. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby, and are overcome by their feelings with him. They fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.

[[Image:Rbh D.JPG|thumb|Thongs, Octopus and the baby hug each other for warmth in the frozen room.]]
Thongs and Octopus are taken to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his. However, he is proven wrong by the [[blood test]]. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in the frozen room next to Max's corpse. Thongs and Octopus decide to fight for the baby, ending up trapped in the frozen room with two minions. Fortunately, they are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room.

Thongs desperately attempts to revive the [[coma|comatose]] baby with a makeshift [[defibrillator]] powered by a [[car battery]]. The baby does not come to and is driven off in an [[ambulance]], where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock [[capital punishment]] demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced. The Lee family arrives, thanking them for saving the baby's life. As a token of appreciation, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs in their household as a bodyguard, driver and head of security respectively.
