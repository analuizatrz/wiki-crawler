==Previews==
===Teaser trailer 1===
[[Image:Simpsons teaser trailer.png|left|thumb|240px|Homer sitting on his couch in the teaser trailer that debuted on [[March 31]] [[2006]] ]]
A [[teaser trailer]] for the film<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/thesimpsonsmovie/| title=Apple - Trailers - The Simpsons Movie - Teaser |publisher=Apple Computer}}</ref> was attached to the Fox movie ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' and could be seen in most theaters in the [[United States|U.S.]] starting on [[March 31]] [[2006]]; this same trailer (cropped for television) was broadcast during the [[April 2]] episode of ''The Simpsons'', [[Million Dollar Abie]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002275630 |title='Simpsons' movie revealed in trailer |accessdate=2006-04-01 |first=Sheigh |last=Crabtree |date=[[2006-04-01]] |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

The teaser begins with the camera [[Panning (camera)|panning]] closely over the [[Superman]] "S" insignia, while a [[voice-over]] actor dramatically announces "In 2007, leaping his way onto the silver screen, the greatest hero in American history." This is meant to give the impression of the trailer being for ''[[Superman Returns]]'', one of the high-profile releases of the summer of 2006. 

The shot then zooms out to show [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], wearing only a tiny [[Superman]] T-shirt and [[briefs]],  sitting on his couch. He blinks and timidly states, "I forgot what I'm supposed to say!"

The words "The Simpsons" appear, followed a moment later by the word "Movie" in large letters, as simultaneously the announcer says "''The Simpsons Movie'' opening worldwide, [[July 27]] [[2007]]." Homer is heard in the background, saying "Uh oh, we'd better get started!" It then displays the release date, while [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] says "excellent" in the background.

The teaser was later shown alongside ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]]'' in cinemas and is available for download in HD from [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] to [[Xbox 360]].

===Animatics===
[[Image:simpsons angry mob.png|right|thumb|300px|The angry mob coming after Homer in the preview.]]
In July 2006, two clips of early, unfinished footage from the movie were shown to audiences during a ''Simpsons'' panel at [[Comic-Con]] 2006.<ref name="ani">{{cite news|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article.php?article_id=5687 |title=''Simpsons'' Movie Peeks at Comic-Con |accessdate=2006-07-25 |first=Ryan |last=Ball |date=[[2006-07-24]] |publisher=[[Animation Magazine]]}}</ref> The clips are black and white [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatic]]s, presented in a 2.39:1 [[aspect ratio]]. Additionally, a new logo for the movie debuted at Comic-Con. The second animatic clip can also be found on the ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' and ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' DVDs. The first clip shows an [[Ochlocracy|angry mob]] of the townspeople heading toward the Simpsons' house, the second is Homer with a pack of sleigh dogs. A third animatic clip was released on the Season 9 DVD boxset, this features Marge and Homer are standing in their back yard next to a small [[storage silo|silo]] Homer built labeled "Pig Crap". 

[[Image:simpsons movie animatic 3.png|left|thumb|250px|Marge and Homer look at the silo in their back yard.]]

===Teaser trailer 2===
A 1Â½-minute-long trailer was first seen on [[November 12]] [[2006]], on FOX, immediately after the second act of ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[G.I. (Annoyed Grunt)]]".<ref>http://www.animationmagazine.net/article.php?article_id=6117</ref>

The trailer begins with a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated]] scene of a picturesque meadow, filled with flowers and butterflies. A rabbit hops from a hole in the ground, and begins dancing from rock to rock to the tune of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[The Nutcracker|Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy]]. The rabbit continues dancing, now along with flowers, as [[Don LaFontaine|a voice over]] says "In a time when computer animation brings us worlds of unsurpassed beauty, one film dares to be ugly."

The Simpsons Movie logo with [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] in the center of the donut falls into view, and knocks down the rabbit and the flowers. Moe says "The Simpsons Movie", and then holds out his arms and grandly announces "In [[Traditional animation|2D]]!" Moe then looks down at the rabbit, and says "Uh... The bunny's not breathing."

[[Image:Simpsons movie trailer 2.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Homer riding a wrecking ball in the [[November 12]] [[2006]] TV trailer]]
The trailer then changes to a scene of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] driving a [[crane (machine)|crane]] with a [[wrecking ball]], and saying "Time to save my family" in a determined voice.  Ironically, this shot uses motion tracking with the aid of 3D computer animation, just moments after Moe insinuated that the movie would not feature 3D computer animation.

The crane moves forward, and swings the wrecking ball towards a truck on an adjacent road. The ball reaches the end of its arc as it reaches the truck, and merely nudges it. As the ball reaches the truck, there is a stop sign in the background. It actually says [[Standing operating procedure|SOP]]. The ball then swings back towards the crane, smashes through the cab, and carries Homer up into the air.

The ball continues to swing back and forth, crashing Homer into the elbow of a large [[Paul Bunyan]] statue in front of a gas station, and a big fake fork attached to a billboard advertising the "Zesty Fork" restaurant. Homer is then swung repeatedly back and forth between a large rock and a building with the sign "A Hard Place", before the wrecking ball finally loses momentum and stays still.

Then, the message "In Theaters Worldwide July 27, 2007" appears. After a few seconds, the trailer flashes back to the previous scene, where the stilled wrecking ball, with Homer still aboard, suddenly smashes into the rock again and then breaks from its chain and crashes into the ground.

The trailer then ends as the movie's website is shown, while Homer says "This film is not yet rated" woozily in the background.

Seven countries will have the movie released before the "In Theaters Worldwide July 27, 2007" release date - this is shown on the official 20th Century Fox [http://www.foxinternational.com/ international] websites for the countries listed.  [[Belgium]] and [[France]] will release it [[25 July]] [[2007]] and [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[The Netherlands]], and [[New Zealand]] will release it on [[26 July]] [[2007]].

=== Teaser trailer 3 ===
The 1Â½-minute trailer appeared on [[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] newspaper's website and was first shown on [[December 11]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite news | title = The Simpsons Movie - UK Exclusive Trailer! | publisher = The Sun | date = [[2006-12-11]] | url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/simpsons | accessdate = 2006-12-12}}</ref>

The trailer begins with the same CGI dance sequence as the theatrical trailer, and then shows Homer and Bart on the roof of their house, with Homer preparing to hammer a nail into a shingle. Homer says "Steady... Steady..." holding the hammer ready over the nail. He swings, misses the nail, and embeds the hammer head in his eye, and Bart laughs at his pain. The release date is shown, and then the scene returns to Homer and Bart on the roof, with Homer again preparing to knock in a nail. Homer says "Steady... Steady..." again, swings, and suddenly the roof beneath him collapses and he falls down into the house with Bart looking down at him. The trailer ends just like the theatrical trailer, with the website being shown and the film being not rated.

This trailer was first exclusive to Australia, UK, Russia, Latin America and Spain. In other markets, this teaser trailer was shown when ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'' was released on [[14 December]] [[2006]]. In North America, It was shown when ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' released on [[December 22]] [[2006]]. Then on [[December 24]] [[2006]], the trailer was on Apple Movie Trailers and given an official North America name, "Trailer 2".

=== Full trailer 1 ===
[[Image:simpsons movie trailer 3.png|thumb|300px|The opening scene in the TV version of the [[February 18]] trailer.]]
On the [[February 14]] [[2007]] [[List of American Idol episodes#Season 6: 2007|episode]] of ''[[American Idol]]'', footage was shown of the contestants attending a private screening where they got to see an early preview of this trailer.<ref>[http://www.curlio.com/article/9544/last/American_Idol_choses_their_top_24 American Idol choose their top 24] at Curlio.com, [[February 14]] [[2007]]</ref>

This trailer first aired during ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[Springfield Up]]" on [[February 18]] [[2007]], and was made available online shortly after. The theatrical version has a different opening from the trailer that aired on TV. It runs approximately 2 minutes and 15 seconds, making it the longest trailer released so far.

The trailer includes scenes of Homer being chased by angry townspeople, Bart spending time with Ned Flanders, Homer playing with a pet pig, Bart skateboarding in the nude, and Springfield being destroyed by various natural disasters, among other things.
<!-- Do not add anything about the band Green Day appearing in the trailer, as no confirmation has been given yet. -->

==Test screening reviews==
In [[Portland, Oregon]] and later [[Tempe, Arizona]], there were test screenings of The Simpsons Movie. It included much unfinished animation, music, and 3D Effects. All of the reviews have been generally positive.<ref>[http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/test-screening-details-from-the-simpsons-pic/ Portland Reviews]</ref><ref>[http://www.aintitcool.com/node/32357 Tempe Reviews]</ref>

==Production==
The people behind ''The Simpsons'' had entertained the thought of a movie since early in the series, but things never came together. The episode "[[Kamp Krusty]]" was originally going to be a movie, but difficulties were encountered in writing a movie length script, at which point the movie plans were dropped in favor of a [[season premiere]].<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Mark Kirkland, David Silverman|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Kamp Krusty"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> For a long time the project was held up. There was trouble finding a story that was right for a film, and the crew did not have enough time to complete a film project, as they already worked full time year-round on the show.<ref name="avclub">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/3|title=Matt Groening interview with The A.V. Club (page 3)|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|publisher=A.V. Club|accessdate=2007-04-23|date=[[2006-04-26]]}}</ref>
Before his death, [[Phil Hartman]] had always wanted to do a [[live action]] [[Troy McClure]] movie{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Several of the show's writers mentioned in DVD commentaries that they would have loved to do it. [[Matt Groening]] has revealed that they had been offered the chance to make a live-action ''Simpsons'' movie, but turned it down as it would have likely ruined the franchise and angered fans. The writers of the show began working on the current script in 2001.<ref name="usa" />

===Rumors and speculation===
Rumors of a Simpsons movie have been circulating since early in the series. Speculation had seen a decrease until 2000, when news website [http://corona.bc.ca Corona] posted an [[April Fool's Day]] [[hoax]] describing fictional plans for a live action movie.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20000511131708/www.corona.bc.ca/films/details/simpsonsmovie.html The Simpsons Movie] at Corona.bc.ca, [[April 1]] [[2000]]</ref> In 2004, rumors of a movie development spiked, with sources claiming that it would premiere on [[July 27]] [[2007]]; this was confirmed by [[20th Century Fox]] on [[June 6]] [[2005]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Technical specifications==
The film will be colored digitally and presented in a 2.39:1 aspect ratio (the equivalent of an [[anamorphic]] film).<!--This does not need to be cited - all relevant information is contained within the linked article.--> Such a wide aspect ratio is somewhat more difficult for [[traditional animation]], especially in long horizontal camera pans, as it requires wider backgrounds to be drawn. However, this format gives the animation a more "cinematic" feel and sets it apart from the 4:3, or "[[full frame]]", format of the television series.
