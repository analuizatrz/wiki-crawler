'''Dominik Hašek''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|['dominɪk 'haʃɛk]}}) (born [[January 29]], [[1965]]) is a professional [[National Hockey League]] [[goaltender]] currently playing for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Although his goaltending style is unorthodox, his acrobatic play and extraordinary reflexes have backstopped him to a successful career.<ref name = "return">{{cite news

From his flexibility and achievevents, he has became one of the most popular and well-known athletes, especially in the [[Czech Republic]]. In an eight season span (1994-2001) he won six [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina Trophies]], and in 1998 he became the first goaltender to win consecutive [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Trophies]].<ref name = "azhockey">{{cite web

His strong play also solidified the idea that European goaltenders could compete in a league that was largely dominated by North American goalies.<ref name = "return"/>
In 2002, [[Wayne Gretzky]] was quoted as saying, "I think Hašek is the best player in the game."<ref>{{cite book

==Playing career==
===Pre-NHL===
Hašek was born in [[Czechoslovakia]] and, as a consequence of [[Communism|communist]] rule, he was not allowed to play in North America. When [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|communist rule ended]], the borders opened, allowing Hašek to [[Emigration|emigrate]] to the United States with aspirations of playing in the NHL.

Hašek was drafted by the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in [[1983 NHL Entry Draft|1983]], and despite being a very talented player, he was selected in the 10th round, 199th overall. This was mainly due to the unwillingness of NHL teams to draft players from behind the [[Iron Curtain]], as players' countries often barred them from playing in the NHL, or the players themselves preferred not to go.<ref name="draft">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=18282|title=Dominik Hasek|accessdate=2006-08-05}}</ref> In fact, it would be several months until Hašek would find out he was even drafted.<ref name="draft"/> His debut with the Blackhawks finally came in the [[1990-91 NHL season|1990-91 season]]. 

From 1981 to 1990, Hašek played in his native Czechoslovakia for the [[Czechoslovak Extraliga]] teams [[HC Pardubice]] and [[HC Jihlava]]. He also played parts of two seasons in the [[International Hockey League|IHL]] with the [[Indianapolis Ice]]. He was named the [[Golden Hockey Stick (Czechoslovakia)|top ice hockey player]] in Czechoslovakia in 1987, 1989, and 1990, along with being named Czechoslovakian Goaltender of the Year from 1986 through 1990.<ref>[http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=126&hubname=nhl-red_wings TSN.ca player profile]</ref>

===NHL career===
In Chicago, represented by agent [[Rich Winter]] throughout his career,<ref name="Agent">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1983/83199.html|title=Dominik Hasek Profile|accessdate=2007-01-27|publisher=HockeyDraftCentral.com}}</ref> Hašek spent time as the backup to [[Ed Belfour]], and only played 25 games over two seasons with the Blackhawks. He made his NHL debut on November 6, 1990 in a game against the [[Hartford Whalers]]. He would record his first shutout against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] later that year.

On [[August 7]], [[1992]], Hašek was traded to the [[Buffalo Sabres]] for goalie [[Stephane Beauregard]] and future considerations, which later materialized into a draft pick used to obtain [[Eric Daze]]. In Buffalo, he was initially the backup goaltender, first playing behind [[Tom Draper]] and then [[Grant Fuhr]]. When Fuhr was injured partway through the season, Hašek was elevated to starter, where he displayed his talent and began to develop into a top tier goaltender.

In [[1993-94 NHL season|1994]], Hašek won his first [[Vezina Trophy]], and he shared the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] with teammate Grant Fuhr. Hašek played 58 games with a league-best 1.95 [[Goals against average|GAA]], seven shutouts, and a .930 [[save percentage]]. He followed this feat by again winning the Vezina Trophy in [[1994-95 NHL season|1995]].

====Conflict with Ted Nolan====
The regular season success of the Sabres in [[1996-97 NHL season|1996-97]] was overshadowed by what took place during the playoffs. Tensions between Sabres head coach [[Ted Nolan]] and Hašek had been high for most of the season, and after the [[Ottawa Senators]] scored on him in game three of the first round of the playoffs, Hašek left the game, which forced backup [[Steve Shields (hockey player)|Steve Shields]] to step in. Hašek claimed he felt his knee pop, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. Being integral to the Sabres' Cup run, the [[Mass media|media]] speculated that Hašek was not doing his utmost to return from the injury because he was at odds with Nolan. ''Buffalo News'' columnist [[Jim Kelley]] wrote a column that night that appeared in the following day's newspaper that detailed that day's events, which irked Hašek. After the Senators won game five, Hašek came out of the Sabres' training room and allegedly attacked Kelley, choking him and tearing his shirt. Despite issuing an apology, things went downhill soon afterward. [http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1983/83199.html]Shields starred as the Sabres rallied to win the series against Ottawa. 

Before the next series against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], the NHL announced that Hašek had been suspended for three games for his altercation with Kelley. Set to return in game four with the team down by three games in the series, Hašek told the Sabres' coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pregame skate. Shields turned in another season-saving performance as Buffalo staved off the almost inevitable sweeping elimination with a win. Again before the fifth game, Hašek declared himself unfit to play and Buffalo lost 6-3, losing the series in five games.

Though General Manager [[John Muckler]] was named "Executive of the Year", he was fired for his constant feuding with Nolan. Hašek, who sided with Muckler, stating in an interview during 1997 NHL Awards Ceremony that "it would be better for [him] if [Nolan] did not return". Despite winning the [[Jack Adams Award]] as top coach, Nolan did not return the next year. Hašek would again win the Vezina Trophy, and also win the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] along with the [[Hart Trophy]] for league MVP. At the time, he, along with [[Jacques Plante]], was the second goalie to ever win the Hart.

Back in Buffalo, he set a team record with 13 shutouts in the [[1997-98 NHL season|1997-98 season]]. He played a career high 72 games, and posted the second most shutouts in a month, with six in December. He again won the Lester B. Pearson Award, Hart Trophy, and Vezina Trophy; he became the first and only goalie to win the Hart twice. He donated the $10,000 prize money after winning the Pearson Award in 1998 to the ''Variety Club of Buffalo''. [http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1983/83199.html]

====1999 Stanley Cup Finals====
[[Image:Hasek hull goal.jpg|right|thumb|An overhead shot of Hull's controversial goal]]

In [[1998-99 NHL season|1999]], Hašek notched a career best 1.87 GAA and .937 save percentage, easily capturing him his third consecutive Vezina. He also finished runner-up for the Hart and Pearson trophies. Though the Sabres did not have a stellar regular season, they defeated the [[Ottawa Senators]], [[Boston Bruins]], and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], largely because of Hašek's play. His team met the [[Presidents' Trophy]]-winning [[Dallas Stars]] in the best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final. The Sabres eventually lost four games to two; the decisive sixth game was notable for being one of the longest Stanley Cup playoff games in NHL history. Hašek and [[Ed Belfour]] made 50 and 53 saves, respectively, in a sudden-death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|triple-overtime]] duel that only ended when [[Brett Hull]] scored a controversial Cup-winning goal with his foot in the crease. <ref name = "hull goal">{{cite news

The following season, the league removed the crease rule.

After the season ended, Hašek contemplated retirement due to a combination of injuries and a desire to become more involved in his family life.<ref name="wp retire">{{cite news

</ref> His initial announcement that he was considering quitting hockey stunned many of his teammates, particularly [[Mike Peca]] and [[Jason Woolley]].<ref name="wp retire"/>

====Final years with Buffalo====

Due to persistent injuries, Hašek's [[1999-2000 NHL season|1999-00 season]] was comparatively poor, and, for the first time in several years, he failed to win a major NHL award. Though he recovered in time for the playoffs, the Sabres were eliminated in the first round after five games against the Philadelphia Flyers.

The [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01 season]] would be Hašek's final year in Buffalo, and would see him winning the Vezina Trophy for the sixth time, the most of any goaltender in the modern era. He also won his second [[William M. Jennings Trophy]]. The Sabres were again matched up with Philadelphia in the first round; Hašek outplayed his Czech compatriot and 1998 Olympic back-up [[Roman Cechmanek]].  Hašek led the Sabres to an 8-0 blanking of the Flyers in the clinching sixth game. The second round was a dramatic series against [[Mario Lemieux]]'s [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], and it went all the way to seven games before the Penguins defeated the Sabres with an overtime win.

====Late career====
Prior to the start of the [[2001-02 NHL season]], Hašek was traded to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in an attempt to lower the Sabres' payroll and to send Hašek to a more competitive team.<ref name = "return"/> He was dealt for [[Vyacheslav Kozlov]], a first round selection in the [[2002 NHL Entry Draft]] (which eventually became [[Jim Slater (ice hockey)|Jim Slater]]), and future considerations. 

During his first season with Detroit, Hašek posted a career high 41 wins with just 15 losses. In June 2002, Hašek lead the Wings past the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in the finals to win the [[Stanley Cup]]. He became the first goalie to be awarded an assist on an overtime game-winning goal in the post-season; Hašek passed the puck to [[Steve Yzerman]], who then assisted [[Fredrik Olausson]] in scoring the final goal. He also claimed the record for most shutouts in a post-season with six, though [[Martin Brodeur]] of the [[New Jersey Devils]] immediately broke the record in [[2002-03 NHL season|2003]].

That summer Hašek offically announced his retirement so he could spend time with his family, and because he claimed his career was complete.<ref name="comeback">

After watching Detroit's first round loss to the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in the [[2002-03 NHL season|2003 playoffs]], he announced his desire to play again.{{fact}} However, the Red Wings had two years left on [[Curtis Joseph]]'s three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure with the knowledge that the rival [[Colorado Avalanche]] would be looking for a goalie to replace [[Patrick Roy]] after his retirement.<ref name="comeback"/> With [[Manny Legacé]] also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.

The [[2003-04 NHL season|2003-04 season]] was problematic for Hašek, as he injured his groin after playing just 14 games. On [[January 9]], [[2004]], he and the team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek told general manager [[Ken Holland]] that he would not accept any pay while he was injured; he did not make his refusal public at that time. On [[February 10]], he announced that he was not going to continue to play that season, surprising Red Wings management.<ref>

In April 2004, he underwent groin surgery in [[Prague]], and returned to his hometown of [[Pardubice]] to recuperate.  

After Hašek's contract with the Wings expired, they decided not to re-sign him. Realizing this, Hašek stated that he wanted to join a club that could contend for the [[Stanley Cup]], and specifically named the [[Ottawa Senators]] as a possibility. On [[July 6]], [[2004]], the Senators signed Hašek to a one-year deal, after trading [[Patrick Lalime]] to the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]].

Hašek played increasingly well for the Senators up until the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Olympics]]; his GAA and save percentage being second best in the NHL. At the Olympics, he injured his right [[Adductor muscles of the hip|adductor muscle]] making a save in the first match against [[Germany at the 2006 Winter Olympics#Ice hockey|Germany]].<ref>{{cite news

Despite the loss, the [[Czech Republic at the 2006 Winter Olympics#Ice hockey|Czech Republic]] finished in third place, and Hašek was awarded the [[bronze medal]] after playing just 9 minutes and 25 seconds.

Hašek's injury caused him to miss the rest of the regular season and post-season despite several rumours that he would return in time for [[2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs|the playoffs]]. Hašek said that if he were to be re-signed, he would play for a base salary of just $500,000 with bonuses.<ref>{{cite news

On [[July 31]], [[2006]], at the age of 41, Hašek joined the Red Wings for the third time in his career. He signed a one-year, $750,000 US contract, with added bonuses if the team does well in the playoffs. The team announced that in order to avoid injury, Hašek would not play on consecutive nights. On [[November 14]]th, [[2006]], Hašek's personal record shutout streak of 181 minutes, 17 seconds was broken by the [[Vancouver Canucks]].

Because of his flexibility, Hašek manages to make saves that other goalies would consider very difficult- an opposing coach once referred to them as "miracle saves." These types of saves include toe-stops, snagging pucks from behind his back, and a maneuvre known as the "Hašek roll". <ref name ="entertainment"/><ref name="flex"/><ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20020131/ctvnews842010/20020131/?hub=CTVNewsAt11&subhub=PrintStory Game report], uses the term "Hasek roll" to illustrate its existence.

For this third stint in Detroit, Hašek lost a considerable amount of weight between May and September to increase his flexibility.

==Off the ice==
Hašek and his wife Alena have two children: a son named Michal (born 1989) and a daughter named Dominika (born 1994). He divides much of his free time playing [[squash (sport)|squash]] and as a defenseman in [[inline hockey]]. He plays soccer recreationally, and his brother, [[Martin Hašek]], plays for the Czech Republic soccer team [[AC Sparta Praha]]. 

He has a brand of sportswear named ''Dominator Clothing'', which was launched shortly after the Nagano Olympics in 1998 and is very popular among Dominik's fans in the Czech Republic; it also had a location in [[Michigan]] for a short time.<ref>

===Inline hockey game incident===

During an inline hockey game on [[May 18]], [[2003]], Hašek was accused of assaulting another player. He was playing as a defender for Bonfire Strida when he crosschecked Martin Sila. The prosecutor in the case, Lenka Strnadova, ruled two months later that there was no evidence that Hašek intended bodily harm and recommended the case be treated as a misdemeanor, punishable only by fine ($95 USD maximum), rather than a felony where jail time would have been possible.<ref>SI.com, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2003/08/08/hasek_czech_ap/ Some blood, no foul]</ref>   Hašek's lawyer Pavel Jelinek announced in a statement that media reports about the incident were exaggerated, with Sila not having sustained any documented injuries. In October 2003, the country's top prosecutor overruled Strnadova, saying her ruling was unlawful because the case had not been properly investigated. The Pardubice prosecution then investigated the case again, and reached the same decision as Strnadova.<ref>{{cite web

==International play==
[[Image:0222 hockey1.jpg|thumb|right|Hašek in goal at the gold medal game against Russia. He earned a shutout in a 1-0 victory]]
Hašek's most memorable international performance came in [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|the 1998 Olympics]]. He was stellar throughout the tournament, allowing six goals in total&mdash;only two of which were in the medal round. Against Team Canada, Hašek stopped Canada's [[Theoren Fleury]], [[Ray Bourque]], [[Joe Nieuwendyk]], [[Eric Lindros]], and [[Brendan Shanahan]] in the shootout win.
Hašek led the [[Czech national ice hockey team|Czech team]] to the [[gold medal]], shutting out the [[Russian national ice hockey team|Russian team]] 1-0 in the final game, stopping 20 shots. Hašek was overjoyed. After he won the gold, he was quoted as saying, <blockquote>"When the game ended, I just threw my stick. I was so happy. When I saw the flag go up, I saw my whole career flash before my eyes from the first time my parents took me to a game until now."<ref>

His play made him arguably one of the most popular figures in the Czech Republic; his reputation is comparable to that of then-president [[Václav Havel]].<ref>
