A native of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Murphy began his performing career as a [[rock musician]]. After turning down a record deal, he made his professional acting debut in the play ''Disco Pigs'' in 1996. He went on to star in Irish and [[United Kingdom|UK]] film and stage productions throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, first coming to international attention in 2003 as the hero in the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] film ''[[28 Days Later]]''. Murphy's best-known roles are as villains in two 2005 blockbusters: the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] in the [[superhero film]] ''[[Batman Begins]]'', and Jackson Rippner in the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. Next came two contrasting, widely acclaimed starring roles: his [[Golden Globe Award]]-nominated performance as [[transgendered]] outcast "Kitten" in 2005's ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'' and a turn as a 1920s Irish revolutionary in 2006 [[Palme d'Or]] winner ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]''. 2007 saw Murphy on the [[London]] stage in ''Love Song'' and onscreen in [[science fiction]] film ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]''.

Murphy attended the Catholic school [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork|Presentation Brothers College]], where he did well academically,<ref name="Independent action hero" /> although he did get into trouble often, sometimes getting suspended, until deciding in his fourth year that misbehaving was not worth the hassle. Not keen on sport, a major part of life at PBC, Murphy found that creative pursuits were not fully nurtured at the school.<ref name="Sun Times 2004" /> Still, it was there that he got his first taste of performing, when he participated in a drama module presented by Pat Kiernan, the director of the [[Corcadorca Theatre Company]].

Also in 1996, Murphy began studying [[law]] at [[University College Cork]] (UCC), but he failed his first year exams because, as he put it, he had "no ambitions to do it."<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> Not only was he busy with his band,<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" /> but he has admitted that he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was the wrong fit for his artistic personality.<ref name="Electric Mail" /> Furthermore, after seeing Corcadorca's stage production of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of ''[[Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme]]'', but, according to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" /> Nonetheless, he began to transition away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, "I think there's such a thing as a performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there.

2005 was the year that Cillian Murphy won wider recognition, first for two high-profile villain roles: Dr. Jonathan Crane in ''[[Batman Begins]]'', and Jackson Rippner in the thriller ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. Originally asked to audition for the role of [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]] in ''Batman Begins'', Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leaped at the chance to connect with director [[Christopher Nolan]].<ref name="Boston Globe 2006" /> Though the lead went to [[Christian Bale]], Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Crane, whose alter ego is [[supervillain]] [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]].<ref name="Back Stage 2005" /> Nolan told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', "He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups."<ref name="Spin 2005">Itzkoff, Dave.

In late 2005 (early 2006 in Europe), Murphy starred as Patrick "Kitten" Braden, a [[transgendered]] Irish orphan in search of his mother, in [[Neil Jordan]]'s dramedy ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Patrick McCabe]]. Murphy had auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, ''[[The Crying Game]]'' director was hesitant to revisit transgender and [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|I.R.A.]] issues. For several years, Murphy lobbied Jordan to make the film before the actor became too old to play the part. In 2004, Murphy prepared for the role by meeting with a [[transvestite]] who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. Taking notice of the group's quick wit, Murphy attributed it to their constantly having to respond to insults from prejudiced people around them.<ref name="TONY 2005" />

Against ''Breakfast on Pluto''&rsquo;s kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s [[glitter rock]] fashion, magic shows, red light districts and I.R.A. violence, Murphy transforms from [[androgynous]] teen to high [[drag (clothing)|drag]] blond bombshell. ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Ruthe Stein said of his performance, "Murphy projects enormous energy onscreen, as he's already shown in ''28 Days Later...'' and ''Red Eye''.

Because the film was set in Cork, Murphy was given a chance at the role of Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, but he had to audition six times before winning the part. Murphy's family goes back in Cork for many generations; during the time period in which ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley'' is set, his grandfather was shot at by British soldiers for playing Irish music.<ref name="LAT pale blue eyes" />

Critic Denby described Murphy's approach to the part of Damien: "Murphy is normally very quiet in movies; he has attained his mystique as an actor by staring at people with baby-blue eyes. In this film, too, he has, at times, a deep stillness, but he has idiosyncratic moments as well, such as when Damien has to execute a teen-ager who has ratted on the I.R.A.

Murphy married his long-time<ref name="Strut" /> live-in girlfriend, artist [[Yvonne McGuinness]], in the summer of 2004 in [[Provence]], [[France]]. The couple live in west London, with their son Malachy,<ref name="Observer O'Hagan" /> who was born in late 2005.<ref name="TONY 2005" /> Murphy is known for being reluctant to speak about his personal life. He frequently gives interviews about his work but does not do TV chat show appearances where actors customarily share information about their private lives.<ref name="Strut" /> He does not have a stylist<ref name="Metro 60 Sec" /> or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage,<ref name="Strut" /> and often attends premieres alone. Shy and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience "a challenge... and not one I want to overcome."<ref name="Hot Press" /> He intentionally practices a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids: "I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk."<ref name="Sun Times 2004" /> Murphy is friends with fellow Irish actors [[Colin Farrell]]<ref name="Sunday Herald 2005">Didcock, Barry.

Music is still an important part of Murphy's life. In 2004, he said, "The only extravagant thing about my lifestyle is my stereo system, buying music and going to gigs."<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> He no longer plays in a rock band, but regularly plays music with friends and on his own,<ref name="Declan Cashin Independent" /> and still writes songs.<ref name="Sun Times 2004" /> Unlike many other famous actors who are also musicians, he does not plan to start another band: "Even if I was good, the very notion of being an actor with a rock band on the side would mean I'd never be taken seriously."<ref name="Observer O'Hagan" /> Murphy is also a dedicated [[running|runner]].<ref name="Elle UK">Odell, Michael. "The Cult of Cillian", ''Elle UK'', March 2007.</ref>

Though raised [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] before turning [[agnosticism|agnostic]] in his teens, Murphy ultimately became an [[atheism|atheist]] after researching his role as a nuclear physicist/astronaut in the science fiction film ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]''.<ref name="Daily Record Golden Boy">Fulton, Rick.
