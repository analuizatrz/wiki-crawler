'''Marketing management''' is a [[business]] discipline focused on the practical application of [[marketing|marketing techniques]] and the [[management]] of a firm's marketing resources and activities.  Marketing managers are often responsible for influencing the level, timing, and composition of customer [[demand]] in a manner that will achieve the company's objectives.

==Definition and scope==
There is no universally accepted definition of the term.  In part, this is due to the fact that the role of a marketing manager can vary significantly based on a business' size, [[corporate culture]], and [[industry]] context.  For example, in a large [[consumer]] products company, the marketing manager may act as the overall [[general manager]] of his or her assigned [[Product (business)|product]] category or [[brand]] with full profit & loss responsibility.  In contrast, a small [[law firm]] may have no marketing personnel at all, requiring the firm's partners to make marketing management decisions on a largely ad-hoc basis.

Vispy Doctor of Ormax (www.ormaxworld.com) , India's leading marketing strategy expert, defines marketing management as applying available resources to create or change the perception of a product or service in the eyes of its target audience by the application of research and communication media.

In the widely used text ''Marketing Management'' (2006), [[Philip Kotler]] and [[Kevin Lane Keller]] define marketing management as "the art and science of choosing [[target markets]] and getting, keeping and growing [[customers]] through creating, delivering, and communicating superior [[Value (marketing)|customer value]]." <ref name="KotlerMM">{{cite book

From this perspective, the scope of marketing management is quite broad.  The implication of such a definition is that any activity or resource the firm uses to acquire customers and manage the company's relationships with them is within the purview of marketing management.  Additionally, the Kotler and Keller definition encompasses both the development of new products and services and their delivery to customers.

Noted marketing expert [[Regis McKenna]] expressed a similar viewpoint in his influential 1991 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article "Marketing is Everything."  McKenna argued that because marketing management encompasses all factors that influence a company's ability to deliver value to customers, it must be "all-pervasive, part of everyone's job description, from the receptionists to the Board of Directors." <ref name="McKennaEverything">{{cite journal

  | date =  Jan. 1991 }}</ref>

This view is also consistent with the perspective of management guru [[Peter Drucker]], who wrote: "Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two--and only these two--basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business."<ref name="DruckerManage">{{cite book

But because many businesses operate with a much more limited definition of marketing, such statements can appear controversial, or even ludicrous to some business executives.  This is especially true in those companies where the marketing department is responsible for little more than developing sales [[brochures]] and executing [[advertising]] campaigns.

The broader, more sophisticated definitions of marketing management from Drucker, Kotler and other scholars are therefore juxtaposed against the narrower operating reality of many businesses.  The source of confusion here is often that inside any given firm, the term marketing management may be interpreted to mean whatever the marketing department happens to do, rather than a term that encompasses all marketing activities -- even those marketing activities that are actually performed by other departments, such as the [[sales]], [[finance]], or [[Business operations|operations]] departments.<ref name="KotlerSales2Marketing">{{cite journal

  | journal = [[Harvard Business Review]]
  | date =  Nov. 1977 }}</ref>  If, for example, the finance department of a given company makes [[pricing]] decisions (for deals, proposals, contracts, etc.), that finance department has responsibility for an important component of marketing management -- pricing.

==Activities and functions==
Marketing management therefore encompasses a wide variety of functions and activities, although the marketing department itself may be responsible for only a subset of these. Regardless of the organizational unit of the firm responsible for managing them, marketing management functions and activities include the following:

===Marketing research and analysis===
In order to make fact-based decisions regarding [[marketing strategy]] and design effective, cost-efficient implementation programs, firms must possess a detailed, objective understanding of their own business and the [[market]] in which they operate.<ref name="Clancy&Krieg">{{cite book

  | date = 2000 
  | id = ISBN 0-684-85555-0 }}</ref>  In analyzing these issues, the discipline of marketing management often overlaps with the related discipline of [[strategic planning]].

Traditionally, marketing analysis was structured into three areas:  Customer analysis, Company analysis, and [[Competitor analysis]] (so-called "3Cs" analysis).  More recently, it has become fashionable in some marketing circles to divide these further into certain five "Cs": Customer analysis, Company analysis, Collaborator analysis, Competitor analysis, and analysis of the industry Context.

The focus of customer analysis is to develop a scheme for [[market segmentation]], breaking down the market into various constituent groups of customers, which are called customer segments or market segments.  Marketing managers work to develop detailed profiles of each segment, focusing on any number of variables that may differ among the segments:  [[demographic]], [[psychographic]], [[geographic]], [[behavioral]], [[needs-benefit]], and other factors may all be examined.  Marketers also attempt to track these segments' perceptions of the various products in the market using tools such as [[perceptual mapping]].

In company analysis, marketers focus on understanding the company's [[cost|cost structure]] and cost position relative to competitors, as well as working to identify a firm's [[core competence|core competencies]] and other competitively distinct [[Resource-Based View|company resources]].  Marketing managers may also work with the [[accounting]] department to analyze the [[profit#Accounting definitions of profit|profits]] the firm is generating from various [[product lining|product lines]] and customer accounts.  The company may also conduct periodic [[brand audits]] to assess the strength of its brands and sources of [[brand equity]].<ref name="KellerSBM">{{cite book

The firm's collaborators may also be profiled, which may include various suppliers, [[Distribution (business)|distributors]] and other channel partners, [[joint venture]] partners, and others.  An analysis of [[Complement good|complementary]] products may also be performed if such products exist.

Marketing management employs various tools from [[economics]] and [[competitive strategy]] to analyze the industry context in which the firm operates.  These include [[Porter 5 forces analysis|Porter's five forces]], analysis of [[strategic group]]s of competitors, [[value chain]] analysis and others.<ref name="PorterCS">{{cite book

  | date = 1998
  | id = ISBN 0-684-84148-7 }}</ref>  Depending on the industry, the [[regulation|regulatory]] context may also be important to examine in detail.

In Competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing especially on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using [[SWOT analysis]].  Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]] and [[product differentiation]], degree of [[vertical integration]], historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Marketing management often finds it necessary to invest in research to collect the data required to perform accurate marketing analysis.  As such, they often conduct [[market research]] (alternately [[marketing research]]) to obtain this information.  Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include:
* [[Qualitative marketing research]], such as [[focus groups]]
* [[Quantitative marketing research]], such as [[statistical survey]]s
* [[Experimental techniques]] such as [[test market]]s
* [[Observational techniques]] such as [[ethnography|ethnographic]] (on-site) observation

Marketing managers may also design and oversee various [[environmental scanning]] and [[competitive intelligence]] processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis.

===Marketing strategy===
{{main|Marketing strategy}}

Once the company has obtained an adequate understanding of the customer base and its own competitive position in the industry, marketing managers are able to make key strategic decisions and develop a [[marketing strategy]] designed to maximize the [[revenues]] and [[profits]] of the firm.  The selected strategy may aim for any of a variety of specific objectives, including optimizing short-term unit margins, revenue growth, [[market share]], long-term profitability, or other goals.

To achieve the desired objectives, marketers typically identify one or more target customer segments which they intend to pursue.  Customer segments are often selected as targets because they score highly on two dimensions: 1) The segment is attractive to serve because it is large, growing, makes frequent purchases, is not price sensitive (i.e. is willing to pay high prices), or other factors; and 2) The company has the resources and capabilities to compete for the segment's business, can meet their needs better than the competition, and can do so profitably.<ref name="Clancy&Krieg"/>  In fact, a commonly cited definition of marketing is simply "meeting needs profitably." <ref name="KotlerMM"/>

The implication of selecting target segments is that the business will subsequently allocate more resources to acquire and retain customers in the target segment(s) than it will for other, non-targeted customers.  In some cases, the firm may go so far as to turn away customers that are not in its target segment.  The doorman at a swanky nightclub, for example, may deny entry to unfashionably dressed individuals because the business has made a strategic decision to target the "high fashion" segment of nightclub patrons.

In conjunction with targeting decisions, marketing managers will identify the desired [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]] they want the company, product, or brand to occupy in the target customer's mind.  This positioning is often an encapsulation of a key benefit the company's product or service offers that is [[Product differentiation|differentiated]] and superior to the benefits offered by competitive products.<ref name="Ries&Trout">{{cite book

  | id = ISBN 0-07-135916-8 }}</ref>  For example, [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] has traditionally positioned its products in the [[automobile]] market in North America in order to be perceived as the leader in "safety", whereas [[BMW]] has traditionally positioned its brand to be perceived as the leader in "performance."

Ideally, a firm's positioning can be maintained over a long period of time because the company possesses, or can develop, some form of [[sustainable competitive advantage]].<ref name="PorterCA">{{cite book

  | publisher = [[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]] 
  | date = 1998 
  | id = ISBN 0-684-84146-0 }}</ref>  The positioning should also be sufficiently relevant to the target segment such that it will drive the purchasing behavior of target customers.<ref name="Ries&Trout"/>

===Implementation planning===
{{main|Marketing plan}}

After the firm's strategic objectives have been identified, the target market selected, and the desired positioning for the company, product or brand has been determined, marketing managers focus on how to best implement the chosen strategy.  Traditionally, this has involved implementation planning across the "4Ps" of marketing: [[Product management]], [[Pricing]], Place (i.e. [[sales]] and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] channels), and [[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]].

Taken together, the company's implementation choices across the 4Ps are often described as the [[marketing mix]], meaning the mix of elements the business will employ to "go to market" and execute the marketing strategy.  The overall goal for the marketing mix is to consistently deliver a compelling [[value proposition]] that reinforces the firm's chosen positioning, builds [[customer loyalty]] and [[brand equity]] among target customers, and achieves the firm's marketing and financial objectives.

In many cases, marketing management will develop a [[marketing plan]] to specify how the company will execute the chosen strategy and achieve the business' objectives.  The content of marketing plans varies from firm to firm, but commonly includes:
* An executive summary
* Situation analysis to summarize facts and insights gained from market research and marketing analysis
* The company's mission statement or long-term strategic vision
* A statement of the company's key objectives, often subdivided into marketing objectives and financial objectives
* The marketing strategy the business has chosen, specifying the target segments to be pursued and the competitive positioning to be achieved
* Implementation choices for each element of the marketing mix (the 4Ps)
* A summary of required investments (in people, programs, IT systems, etc.)
* [[Financial analysis]], projections and forecasted results
* A timeline or high-level project plan
* Metrics, measurements and control processes
* A list of key risks and strategies for managing these risks

===Project, process, and vendor management===
Once the key implementation initiatives have been identified, marketing managers work to oversee the execution of the marketing plan.  Marketing executives may therefore manage any number of specific projects, such as sales force management initiatives, product development efforts, channel marketing programs and the execution of [[public relations]] and advertising campaigns.  Marketers use a variety of [[project management]] techniques to ensure projects achieve their objectives while keeping to established [[Schedule (project management)|schedules]] and [[budgets]].

More broadly, marketing managers work to design and improve the effectiveness of core marketing [[Business process|processes]], such as [[new product development]], [[brand management]], [[marketing communications]], and pricing.  Marketers may employ the tools of [[business process reengineering]] to ensure these processes are properly designed, and use a variety of [[process management]] techniques to keep them operating smoothly.

Effective execution may require management of both internal resources and a variety of external [[merchant|vendors]] and service providers, such as the firm's [[advertising agency]].  Marketers may therefore coordinate with the company's Purchasing department on the [[procurement]] of these services.

===Organizational management and leadership===
Marketing management usually requires [[leadership]] of a department or group of professionals engaged in marketing activities.  Often, this oversight will extend beyond the company's marketing department itself, requiring the marketing manager to provide [[Cross-functional team|cross-functional]] leadership for various marketing activities.  This may require extensive interaction with the [[human resources]] department on issues such as [[recruiting]], [[training]], [[leadership development]], [[performance appraisal]]s, [[Salary|compensation]], and other topics.

Marketing management may spend a fair amount of time building or maintaining a [[marketing orientation]] for the business.  Achieving a market orientation, also known as "customer focus" or the "marketing concept", requires building consensus at the senior management level and then driving customer focus down into the organization.  Cultural barriers may exist in a given business unit or functional area that the marketing manager must address in order to achieve this goal.  Additionally, marketing executives often act as a "brand champion" and work to enforce [[corporate identity]] standards across the enterprise.

In larger organizations, especially those with multiple business units, top marketing managers may need to coordinate across several marketing departments and also resources from finance, [[R&D]], [[engineering]], operations, [[manufacturing]], or other functional areas to implement the marketing plan.  In order to effectively manage these resources, marketing executives may need to spend much of their time focused on political issues and inte-departmental negotiations.

The effectiveness of a marketing manager may therefore depend on his or her ability to make the internal "sale" of various marketing programs equally as much as the external customer's reaction to such programs.<ref name="KotlerMM"/>

===Reporting, measurement, feedback and control systems===
Marketing management employs a variety of [[metrics]] to measure progress against objectives.  It is the responsibility of marketing managers -- in the marketing department or elsewhere -- to ensure that the execution of marketing
programs achieves the desired objectives and does so in a cost-efficient manner.

Marketing management therefore often makes use of various organizational control systems, such as sales forecasts, sales force and reseller [[incentive]] programs, [[sales force management system]]s, and [[customer relationship management]] tools (CRM).  Recently, some software vendors have begun using the term "[[Marketing Operations Management|marketing operations management]]" or "[[Marketing Resource Management|marketing resource management]]" to describe systems that facilitate an integrated approach for controlling marketing resources.  In some cases, these efforts may be linked to various [[supply chain management]] systems, such as [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[material requirements planning]] (MRP), [[Efficient Consumer Response|efficient consumer response]] (ECR), and [[inventory management]] systems.

Measuring the [[return on investment]] (ROI) of and [[marketing effectiveness]] various marketing initiatives is a significant problem for marketing management.  Various market research, accounting and financial tools are used to help estimate the ROI of marketing investments.  [[Brand valuation]], for example, attempts to identify the percentage of a company's [[market capitalization|market value]] that is generated by the company's brands, and thereby estimate the financial value of specific investments in brand equity.  Another technique, [[integrated marketing communications]] (IMC), is a CRM database-driven approach that attempts to estimate the value of marketing mix executions based on the changes in customer behavior these executions generate.<ref name="SchultzCG">{{cite book
