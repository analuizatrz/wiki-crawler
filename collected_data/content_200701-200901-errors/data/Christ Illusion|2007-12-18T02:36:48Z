'''''Christ Illusion''''' is the ninth studio album by the [[United States|American]] [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]]. Released on [[August 8]], [[2006 in music|2006]], the album received generally favorable critical reviews, and it entered the [[Billboard 200]] at number five&mdash;the band's highest U.S. chart position to date. ''Christ Illusion'' includes the [[Grammy Award]]-winning "[[Eyes of the Insane]]", and is the band's first album to feature original drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] since [[1990]]'s ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]''. 

Depicting a mutilated Christ painted by longtime collaborator [[Larry Carroll (artist)|Larry Carroll]], the album's graphic artwork courted controversy. An alternative cover was issued to conservative retailers who felt uncomfortable with the original. Lyrical themes, particularly in the song "[[Jihad (song)|Jihad]]" which describes the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th attacks]] from a terrorist perspective, outraged the [[Mumbai]]-based ''Catholic Secular Forum'' in [[India]]. As a result, all Indian stocks of the album were recalled and destroyed by [[EMI]] India.

==Recording==
''Christ Illusion'' was recorded via computer between two studios: NRG Studios, [[North Hollywood]], with assistant engineer Dave Colvin; and Westlake Studios, [[Los Angeles]], where Brian Warwick assisted.<ref name="AlbumNotes">''Christ Illusion'' album notes, [[August 8]], [[2006]].

''Christ Illusion'' was originally scheduled for release on [[June 6]], [[2006]];<ref name="VENOMPissing"/> the sixth day of the sixth month of the sixth year.

The album was met with generally favourable reviews. Thom Jurek of ''[[All Music Guide]]'' hailed the album as "raging, forward-thinking heavy metal melding with hardcore thrash", and wrote that ''Christ Illusion'' marked a return to "what made them such a breath of fresh air in the first place."<ref name="AllMusicReview">{{cite web| title = All Music Guide Review - ''Christ Illusion''|author = Jurek, Thom|publisher = [[All Music Guide]]|url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:rwf2zfi5eh7k~T1|accessdate = 2007-02-22 }}</ref> Ben Ratliff of the ''[[New York Times]]'' described the album as possessing "a kind of demented gravity, and the music bears it out: it is the most concentrated, focused Slayer record in 20 years."<ref name="NYTReview">{{cite news | last = Ratliff| first = Ben| title =New CD's| work =| pages =| publisher = New York Times  | date = 2006-08-14  | url =|accessdate=}}</ref> [[PopMatters]] critic Adrien Begrand called it "Slayer's best album in sixteen years and their most thought-provoking work to date",<ref name="PopMatters Review">{{cite web| title = PopMatters Review - ''Christ Illusion''|author = Begrand, Adrien|publisher = [[PopMatters]]|url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/slayer-christ-illusion/|accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}</ref> and the album was placed at number 15 on [[PopMatters]] list of ''The Best Metal Albums of 2006''.<ref name="PopMatters Column">{{cite web| title = PopMatters Column - ''The Best Metal Albums of 2006''|author = Begrand, Adrien|publisher = [[PopMatters]]|url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/columns/article/8836/the-best-metal-albums-of-2006/

Drummer Lombardo came in for particular praise; though ''Rolling Stone'' slated the album, the reviewer acknowledged that "at least their awesome drummer Dave Lombardo shows off some chops."<ref name="StoneReview"/> ''[[Blabbermouth]]'''s Don Kaye thought that "while flawed", Christ Illusion "proves that the band still has a few tricks up its sleeve and one very potent weapon behind the kit."<ref name="BlabbermouthReview"/> Peter Atkinson of ''KNAC.com'' felt similarly, and reported Lombardo's "performance is top notch throughout and does give the album a looser feel than Paul Bostaph’s technical precision offered."<ref name="KNACReview"/>

Not all critics were so positive. Chris Steffen of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine dismissed the album, noting that it "mines much of the same territory as its predecessor, ''God Hates Us All'', just without the memorable riffs."<ref name="StoneReview">{{cite web

==Album artwork and lyrical themes==
Several aspects of ''Christ Illusion'''s content and promotion generated adverse attention and publicity. In particular the cover art, painted by [[Larry Carroll (artist)|Larry Carroll]] and depicting a mutilated, stoned Jesus, coupled with song lyrics which dealt with terrorism, warfare and religion, drew criticism  from conservative groups.

Critical reaction to the album's lyrical content was mixed. Thom Jurek of ''[[All Music Guide]]'' felt the "dark, unrelentingly twisted-as-fuck lyrics reflect a singular intensity", and praised the band for connecting their anti-religion stance with a belief that religion has underscored many wars throughout history.<ref name="AllMusicReview"/> However, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s Chris Steffen mourned that it had become "downright painful to hear Tom Araya — at 45 years old! — continue to belt out the band's increasingly self-parodying, anti-religious lyrics", and singled out lyrics such as "Religion's a whore" and "I've made my choice: six six six!" as over the top.<ref name="StoneReview"/> Jamie Thomson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that the album left "no blasphemy...unuttered",<ref name="GuardianReview"/> while Peter Atkinson of ''KNAC.com'' observed that "when not fixating on religion, the band revisit their other favorite subject — war — in surprisingly familiar terms", and remarked that Slayer had sunk "to the level of God-repelling dunderheads [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]]."<ref name="KNACReview"/> He concluded the review with the opinion that "It's déjà vu all over again from ''[[God Hates Us All]]'' — and once you've titled something ''God Hates Us All'', haven't you made your point enough already?"<ref name="KNACReview"/>

A Christian group, the [[Mumbai]] based ''Catholic Secular Forum'' (''CSF''), condemned the album's lyrical content. The organisation's general secretary Joseph Dias issued a statement in which he deemed the lyrics to "Skeleton Christ" to be an "insult to Christianity".<ref name="IllusionRecalled"/> The memorandum was sent to Mumbai's police commissioner, and further expressed concern that the track "[[Jihad (song)|Jihad]]" would offend "the sensibilities of the Muslims...and secular Indians who have respect for all faiths."<ref name="IllusionRecalled"/> EMI India met with the ''CSF'', apologising for ''Christ Illusion'''s release and recalling the album with no plans of a reissue.<ref name="IllusionRecalled"/> On [[October 11]], [[2006]] it was announced all stocks had been destroyed.<ref name="Offensive' album pulled in India">{{cite web
