The '''Exiles''' are a group of [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] characters from [[Marvel Comics]]. The Exiles, created by writer [[Judd Winick]] and artist [[Mike McKone]], consists of characters from different dimensions, or realities, which have been removed from time and space in order to correct problems (often called “hiccups") in various alternate worlds and divergent timelines in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]. The team usually is made up of six members and each time a member is killed or returned to his or her home reality, a new member is introduced and joins the team. However, the series is notable for the number of characters who stay dead, in contrast to the [[Comic book death|frequent resurrections]] that occur in the main Marvel and DC continuities.

==Fictional team biography==
The Exiles team consisted originally of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] (Clarice Ferguson, from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] continuity), [[Mimic (comics)#Exiles|Mimic]] (Calvin Rankin), Magnus (son of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]), [[Thunderbird (comics)#Exiles|Thunderbird]] (John Proudstar), [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] (Talia Josephine "T.J." Wagner, daughter of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Scarlet Witch]]) and [[Changeling (Marvel Comics)#Exiles|Morph]].

[[Image:XMEN 05252005 0024.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Exiles ''#1. Art by Mike McKone. Featuring the original roster.]]

When Magnus dies<ref>''Exiles'' #2</ref>, he is replaced by [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]] (Mariko Yashida). [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Sasquatch]] (Heather Hudson) arrives when [[Thunderbird]] becomes comatose during a battle with the world-eating [[Galactus]]<ref>''Exiles'' #10</ref>.

The Exiles then discover there is a second team conscripted by the [[Timebroker]], [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]]<ref>''Exiles'' #12</ref>, whose missions typically involve killing or maiming innocents and heroes. The two teams join forces to rescue a group of children from a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] prison camp. However, the teams are told the second stage of the mission is to kill one of the children - David Richards (son of [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Franklin Richards]]) - who will apparently grow up to become a powerful super villain. Weapon X is willing to kill him, but the Exiles are not and the two teams fight until the [[Timebroker]] intervenes. Sabretooth (of the Weapon X team) agrees to stay behind and raise David Richards himself.

The [[Timebroker]] sends Blink home after a visit to a world plagued by a variant of the [[Legacy Virus]], since the team had repaired her personal broken chain in time<ref>''Exiles'' #22</ref> and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] (Illyana Rasputin) takes her place. Mimic then replaces Blink as leader, gaining the Tallus.

The Exiles arrive in the main [[Marvel Universe]] ([[Earth-616]]) where they meet the [[X-Men]] after [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]]'s cancelled wedding<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #425-426</ref>. The Exiles team up with the X-Men against an evil Havok from the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' universe, who shares a body with the good Havok. After Havok is subdued, the Timebroker arrives to personally eliminate the ''Mutant X'' Havok's consciousness.<ref>''Exiles'' #28-30</ref>

After [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]] is killed by a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]-infected [[Mimic (comics)#Exiles|Mimic]]<ref>''Exiles'' #37</ref>, she is replaced by the Exiles' former teammate [[Blink (comics)|Blink]]. During the next mission<ref>''Exiles'' #43</ref>, the Exiles and Weapon X are forced to battle each other until only six remain alive. [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] is killed by Hyperion when she attempts to switch sides and betray the Exiles. Hyperion is eventually defeated by Blink, who teleports his own heat vision into his back, paralyzing him. [[Alternate versions of Gambit#Exiles/Weapon X|Gambit]] (of Weapon X) is allowed to deliver the killing blow against Hyperion with Magik's sword, which actually kills them both, leaving five Exiles alive and their mission complete.

The Exiles visit the main Marvel Universe for a second time<ref>''Exiles'' #46-48</ref> where they are joined by [[Namora]], who replaces Magik, and are instructed to "leave their possessions and earn their wings". Reed Richards deduces this means they are to leave [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] behind (whose power involves [[possession]]) and have [[Beak (comics)|Beak]] join the Exiles, which is confirmed by the Timebroker.

===The Timebrokers===
The team are told by [[Celestial (comics)|The Celestials]] to "beware the Timebroker, he is not what he seems"<ref>''Exiles'' #53</ref>. After this, the Timebroker's behavior becomes increasingly strange. [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] is removed from the team<ref>''Exiles'' #59</ref> without explanation and replaced with former [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] member [[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]]. The Tallus orders the Exiles to kill [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and despite their refusal, they are allowed to move onto a new mission (normally a mission ''must'' be completed for the Exiles to move on). Next, the Timebroker replaces Beak with [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]]<ref>''Exiles'' #60</ref>, which they are informed is a punishment for disobeying previous orders.

Eventually, the Exiles break free of the Timebroker and stage a raid on Panoptichron (also known as the "Crystal Palace"), home of the Timebroker and a location from which many parallel universes can be monitored. Here they discover that the Timebroker is an alien race of bug-like beings that found the Panoptichron and accidentally broke a series of timelines. Lacking the power to repair the timelines, they concocted this scheme of recruiting heroes from various worlds to do their work for them.  Not only that, all previously "returned" heroes are actually in Panoptichron, frozen in blocks, along with the killed heroes. As a final twist, the evil Hyperion has broken free of his prison and has taken over Panoptichron. The Exiles defeat Hyperion, but at the cost of [[Namora]] and Holocaust's lives. Beak returns from stasis and saved the day by calling on two good versions of Hyperion for help, fulfilling his destiny as an Exile. Only Blink, Mimic, Morph, Sabretooth, Beak, and Heather Hudson remain to pick up the pieces.<ref>''Exiles'' #62-65</ref>

===World Tour===
The Exiles then return to [[Earth-616]] to take Beak home. Unfortunately, Earth-616 is dominated by the [[House of M]]. During their stay, the Exiles run afoul of the body-hopping serial killer [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]], who steals data from the Panoptichron and escapes from [[Earth-616]], leaving Beak [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]] back home<ref>''Exiles'' #69-71</ref>. The Exiles chase Proteus through several realities, including an alternate version of [[New Universe]]<ref>''Exiles'' #72-74</ref>, an alternate version of [[Marvel 2099|2099]]<ref>''Exiles'' #75-76</ref>, [[Squadron Supreme]]<ref>''Exiles'' #77-78</ref>, [[Alternate versions of Hulk#The Maestro|Future Imperfect]]<ref>''Exiles'' #79-80</ref>, and [[Heroes Reborn]]<ref>''Exiles'' #81-82</ref>, before finally bringing [[Proteus]] down by trapping him in Morph’s body, which does not decay, unlike all of Proteus’s other host bodies. During the “World Tour” of hunting down Proteus, Mimic is possessed by Proteus and dies, forcing the Exiles to pick up new members [[Longshot]], [[Spider-Man 2099]], and [[Power Princess]] to restore their diminished numbers.

===Post-World Tour===
The Exiles begin cleaning out the stasis gallery of former Exiles and Weapon X members and send them back home. [[Iron Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] are sent back to their respective realities alive, while every other Earth with a missing superhuman holds a funeral. Blink, at the suggestion of [[Power Princess]], takes Mimic home to be buried with his X-Men instead of burying him in Panoptichron. [[Spider-Man]], Sabretooth, and Heather Hudson all decided to visit their home realities<ref>''Exiles'' #83</ref>. Unfortunately, the Timebreakers ditch the Exiles when the Timebreakers believe that they are not saving realities as they should be. However, after using several squads of Wolverines to complete the next mission and failing, Logan (from [[Days of Future Past]]) and young James Howlett convince the Timebreakers that the Exiles are needed<ref>''Exiles'' #84-85</ref>. The Exiles finally resume their reality-saving missions for the first time since they discovered Panoptichron when they save a reality where the [[Silver Surfer]] has already destroyed the Earth and is trying to destroy [[Galactus]], who is the restorer of worlds in this reality<ref>''Exiles'' #86-87</ref>.

Then, Heather discovers an Earth inhabited by a disturbingly close approximation of the original Exiles team, complete with their own Timebroker. After the "classic Exiles" fight "the all-new Exiles" (as Morph put it), it is later revealed that the whole thing was a scheme orchestrated by the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]], who seeks revenge on the Exiles for freeing [[Professor X]] on their first mission and ruining a bet. The Exiles, past and present, join forces with the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] of that Earth to defeat the Grandmaster. The current team then leaves the Earth in the hands of the approximation Exiles.

The Exiles then take three weeks to save a chain of cracked realities, injuring Blink, Morph, and [[Spider-Man]]. They also discover that Proteus is possibly immune to metal while in Morph’s body. Meanwhile, former Exile, [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], is in the stasis gallery, dreaming of what might have been had he not become comatose.

===Enter Psylocke===
Later, [[Power Princess]] leaves the team to return to the [[Squadron Supreme]] and [[Psylocke]] is brought on board to replace her.<ref>''Exiles'' #89</ref> Blink, Longshot, and Spider-Man are brainwashed by Hydra leaving only Sabretooth to pick up Morph and Psylocke. They are sent to kill Reed Richards. [[Slaymaster]]'s arrival makes them fail as Betsy faints before killing Reed. The world was erased, with the Exiles still there, but it was magically restored by Reed Richards, and Valeria Richards' amulet restores the world's population because they were being stored in the amulet. The Exiles are still there so they can help Psylocke recover from wounds inflicted by Wolverine, and to help rebuild the planet<ref>''Exiles'' #93</ref>. Meanwhile, another Slaymaster slays another Psylocke on another world.

After the Exiles return to Panoptichron, they find it empty, with no equipment, Timebreakers, or Heather. Blink and Morph eventually visit Heather, who thought the Exiles were dead and left Panoptichron. Heather is now pregnant and out of commission, so [[Psylocke]] stays behind to learn more about the Panoptichron while the other Exiles resume their missions. There she experiences visions which warn her of something bad to come, and an alternate version of [[Kitty Pryde]] appears from nowhere with no warning. The Exiles go to a seemingly perfect world led by [[Doctor Doom|Victor Von Doom]] but when Blink is caught by [[Reed Richards]] she begins to discover what hides behind this facade<ref>''Exiles'' #96</ref>. She then recruits Longshot and Morph, who also sense something amiss with this world. They flee with that world's Reed to begin a resistance. Meanwhile, [[Spider-Man 2099]] meets [[Gwen Stacy]] and Sabretooth has a [[one-night stand]] with this world's [[Invisible Woman]]. In reality, she was assigned to get close to him so Doom could copy the Tallus, which he does. He then sends a team of soldiers to Panoptichron. They take out [[Psylocke]] and assume [[Kitty Pryde]] is a freaked out child, though she appears to be faking that. Then the soldiers are attacked by [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], who is no longer comatose<ref>''Exiles'' #97</ref>. [[Kitty Pryde]] (who goes by Cat), uses her phasing powers to make a diversion long enough to allow Thunderbird to free [[Psylocke]]. Together, they defeat the soldiers and send them home, just in time for them to see Doom's defeat, whose Earth is destroyed by [[Reed Richards]] as there is no way to turn the human back to their normal emotional state.

As a result the Exiles are scattered to various dimensions<ref>''Exiles'' #98</ref>, much like [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] had done previously<ref>''Exiles'' #32-34</ref>. [[Psylocke]], [[Thunderbird]], and Cat are able to work on the equipment and retrieve Blink, Morph, and Sabretooth, and new members [[Mystique (comics)#Exiles|Mystiq]] and [[Rogue (comics)#Exiles|Rogue]] are brought along. [[Spider-Man 2099]] finds a girlfriend and stays on the world he landed in. Longshot, once again, got lucky and landed in the Crystal Palace after the transport went wrong.

===''Die by the Sword''===
{{seealso|X-Men: Die by the Sword}}
[[Psylocke]] and [[Thunderbird]] traveled to Earth-616 to visit [[Captain Britain]] and [[Nocturne]] during [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005-2007)|New Excalibur]]'s victory party<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #1</ref>. However during the party [[Captain Britain]] is wounded by a strike force led by an armored lady called Rouge. While Betsy tries to care for her brother everybody else tries to fight, even [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]] and [[Pete Wisdom]] who were about to have sex, but, realizing they can't win they teleport to the Panoptichron. There Dazzler discovers that Longshot, while alive, doesn't remember her and is about to kill herself to ease her pain when Mystiq comes to talk her out of it. TJ happily reunites with her former teammates while [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] is deemed the best option to care for Brian. Meanwhile Cat, using the scanner, realizes that [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] and [[Saturnyne]] are in trouble<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #2</ref>. The Corps then suffers a lot of losses, despite Saturnyne's intervening. While Cat checks on Brian, Blink, Morph, Sabertooth, Thunderbird, and Dazzler join the battle field<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #3</ref>. Dazzler battles Rouge-Mort,who has badly wounded Roma, and Longshot gets concerned about her, making both himself and Sage wonder why/how, while Morph battles Jasper by morphing into the Fury but his plan is quickly foiled. Sage, Psylocke, and Wisdom recruit [[Albion (comics)|Albion]] to their cause, who proves to be a match for James Jaspers until Jaspers turns into the Fury. Merlyn then comes to his daughter to finish the job<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #4</ref>only to be beaten by Psylocke. Cap then makes his move on the Fury and with the help of Blink and Albion vanquishes him for now, leading to Merlyn's defeat. However this victory comes with a price as Roma dies, though not before transferring her knowledge into Sage's mind. Saturnyn then promises to free Albion from jail to lead the Corps while Sage and TJ switch teams with Longshot who now remembers the highlights of his past<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #5</ref>.

===Exiles #100, ''Days of Then and Now''===
Blink, Nocturne, and Thunderbird decide to leave the team because they are physically and emotionally exhausted and need a break. They leave for Heather Hudson's reality so that Heather can keep track of Nocturne's progress as she continues to recover from her stroke. Sage struggles with her new knowledge gained from Roma and accidentally fights the other Exiles. Cat and Rogue explore the palace and almost die in a bungee-jumping accident, prompting Rogue to reveal flying powers.

Blink discovers an Earth they were supposed to save, but did not because they were chasing Proteus during the World Tour. Iron Man, Nighthawk, Wild Child, and Luke Cage from that reality died because they did not receive help from the Exiles. So Blink decides to help an alternate [[Quentin Quire]] by acting as the Timebroker through [[Alternate versions of Gambit#Exiles/Weapon X|Gambit]]'s old Tallus, which is given to him by the [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] from the reality where the Exiles had battled [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] after Quentin is able to transport himself there on his own. Then he meets [[Mary Jane Watson#Exiles|Mary Jane]] and [[Luke Cage]], from the [[Phalanx (comics)#Exiles|Vi-Locks]] reality, and an alternate [[Spitfire (New Universe)|Spitfire]]. Finally he ends up in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] where he saves [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]]. Blink then sends all five heroes (Luke Cage, Quentin, Nighthawk, Spitfire, and Wild Child) to replace Iron Man, Nighthawk, Wild Child, and Luke Cage from Quentin's reality.

===Current Status===
The team went to Earth 6706 to recruit Gambit and found themselves in a three-way war between Namor, Ororo and the Black Panther. The team was separated with Rogue with Gambit and Namor, Mystiqe in disguise with the Panther's team and Sabretooth and Psylocke with Ororo. They eventually reunited for a final fight against the Panther and would have died if not for Psylocke and Gambit's mother's powers. Their mission was eventually revealed to them and they left the Earth despite the fact that the Panther had taken control of it<ref>New Exiles #1-4</ref>. Meanwhile, Morph, Sage and Cat are sucked into a world were Kitty shifts to another form. Sage regains her telepathic powers, as they defend a man who has fallen in love with a dragon. After some fighting, the parents eventually surrender against true love and the dragon becomes human, while the Exiles are brought back to the Panoptichron, where Cat reveals that Gambit was listed as a member even before he was recruited. In the mean time, [[Invisible Woman#Exiles|Hydra]] recruits a Wolverine-like-guy to her cause<ref>New Exiles #5-7</ref>.

==Tallus==
The Tallus is a communications device, which is worn by the leader of the group, which was formerly used by the Timebroker to assign each mission. Blink wears the Tallus in the beginning, but it is later transferred to Sabretooth when Blink rebels against the Timebroker (later revealed to be Hyperion). Mimic also wears the Tallus for a time in Blink's absence. It is now used as a means of communication between its wearer and whoever is operating the crystal palace on various missions. It has a slightly different appearance for each wearer.

==Weapon X==
{{main|Weapon X (Exiles)}}

First seen in ''Exiles'' #5, they are a team that did more ruthless missions than the Exiles did. This team had various members and its roster changed more than the Exiles. Weapon X was originally composed of [[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]], [[Garrison Kane#Exiles|Kane]], [[Mesmero#Exiles|Mesmero]], [[Alternate versions of Wolverine#Exiles & Weapon X|Wolverine]], [[David North (comics)#Exiles|Maverick]], and [[Deadpool (comics)#Exiles|Deadpool]]. The team was destroyed during the "A Blink in Time" arc, when the Timebroker wanted to downsize both teams in hopes of killing off the insane [[Hyperion (comics)#Exiles|Hyperion]], who abandoned missions to try to rule worlds.

==Exiles characters==
Whenever one of the Exiles dies, is sent home, or something happens to them, they are replaced by someone else, and thus the roster changes. The first occurrence is when Magnus dies in Exiles #2, and Sunfire comes on board to replace him.

[[Image:Wolverine Exiles Team Roster.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The Wolverines, courtesy of X-Men Messiah Complex Mutant Files]]
After the Timebreakers fired the original Exiles Team, they gathered multiple squads consisting solely of alternate versions of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. The last Wolverine squad was formed in ''Exiles'' #85 and consisted the following members

!width=5%| Character
!width=8%| First appearance

|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|Patch]] (Earth-181)
||Exiles #85
||Apparently from the same Earth as Weapon X's Daredevil.  Killed by Sabretooth.

|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|Zombie Wolvie]] (Earth-6195)
||''Exiles'' #85
||Not the same Zombie Wolverine who first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' 22-23 and ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' #1-5. The original Marvel Zombies version became a member of The Galactus as of Marvel Zombies #5.  Killed when Elsie Dee's internal bomb went off.

|-
||[[Albert (comics)|Albert Dee]] (Earth-50211)
||Exiles #85
||An android built to destroy Wolverine, Elsie Dee's acolyte.  Killed in the blast when Logan attacked Brother Mutant.

|-
||[[Elsie-Dee#Exiles|Elsie Dee]] (Earth-50211)
||Exiles #85
||An android built to destroy Wolverine, Albert Dee's acolyte.  Detonated her internal bomb to weaken Brother Mutant.

|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|Weapon X]] (Earth-520)
||Exiles #85
||Logan, right after his adamantium was implanted on him by the [[Weapon X]] Program.  Assumed dead in the Exiles attack on Brother Mutant.
|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|James Howlett]] (Earth-1880)
||Exiles #85
||He has just discovered his powers and thusly has assumed neither Logan's nor Wolverine's identity.  The only Wolverine Exile to return home alive from the team introduced in Exiles #85.
|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|Major Logan]] (Earth-811/DotFP)
||Uncanny X-Men #141/Exiles #85 (as an Exile)
||He apparently survived his demise at the hand of the Sentinels thanks to his healing Factor. He, Marvel Girl III, Hyperstorm and Kate Pryde are the only known survivors from the X-Men in this timeline.  Killed by an energy blast as he nearly killed Brother Mutant.  His death echoes the one featured in the [[Days of Future Past]] timeline (although a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]], not another mutant, killed him in that timeline). It is not clear if this storyline takes place before or after events in the [[Earth X]] universe. Thus this character may come from a (further) divergent reality.

|-
||Others
||Exiles #85-86
||43 other Wolverine versions were to be seen on issue #86 cover, a [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], a [[clown]], and a [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] version were featured in the comics and at least 3 were on the Panoptichrons screen at the end of #86. 27 of them died, according to Heather Hudson (including 6 of the 7 main). Other versions included female Wolverines, Brother Xavier and a Deadpool-like version.
 
|-
</TABLE>

The mission of these Wolverine Teams was to eliminate the Brother Mutant, but he(?) captured and hypnotized them. Finally, the last Wolverine Team manages to kill the Brother Mutant, with the help of the First Exiles Team. In the end, seventeen Wolverines perished during the fight. James Howlett was the only member sent home.

===Other characters===
In ''Exiles'' there has been a number of special heroes, villains and others. Some of them are even significant in more than one reality and/or story.
