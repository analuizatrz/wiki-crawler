'''Belarus''' ({{lang-be|Беларусь}}, {{lang-ru|Беларусь}}, Transliteration: Byelarus') is a [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[country]] in [[Eastern Europe]], bordering [[Russia]] to the east, [[Ukraine]] to the south, [[Poland]] to the west, and [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] to the north. Its capital is [[Minsk]] and other major cities include [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], [[Hrodna|Grodno]], [[Homyel|Gomel]], [[Mogilev]] and [[Vitebsk]]. One third of the country is forested, and industries such as agriculture and manufacturing are staples of the Belarusian economy.

At different points in its history, parts of Belarus have been under the control of several countries, including the [[Duchy of Polatsk]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Empire]]. Belarus became a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republic in 1922 (see [[Byelorussian SSR]]). The republic declared its sovereignty on [[27 July]] [[1990]]. Following the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse]] of the Soviet Union, Belarus officially declared independence on [[25 August]] [[1991]]. Since 1994, [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the country's president. Belarus is currently in negotiations with Russia to unify into a single state: the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]]. 

Belarus is also the only European nation that has been formally barred from joining the [[Council of Europe]] because of human rights violations and for conducting elections that do not meet democratic standards.

==History of the name==
<!-- If you're here to add various translations to "White Russia" to the article, please don't add any more in. We got plenty of them. If you're adding an interwiki link, ignore this message. -->
Historically, the country was referred to in [[English language|English]] as "[[White Russia]]," although this is not exactly correct. The correct translation is  "White [[Ruthenia]]," which either describes the area of Eastern Europe populated by Slavic people or the various states that occupied the area.<ref>http://www.halgal.com/ruthenian.html</ref> Despite this, the practice of using the term White Russia continues as of 2006 in the following languages: "Weißrussland" in [[German language|German]], "Beyaz Rusya" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or "Λευκορωσία" (Leukorosía) in [[Greek language|Greek]] (see [[wiktionary:Belarus]] for the full list). <!-- Please don't insert any other languages' translations of Belarus; they belong on the [[White Russia]] page.  Thanks! --> 

The first known use of the term "White Russia" to refer to Belarus was in the late 16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]]. He used the term to describe areas of [[Ivan IV|Ivan the Terrible's]] empire.  During the 17th century, the Russian tsars used "White Ruthenia", asserting that they were trying to recapture their heritage from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After the Commonwealth broke up, the lands that now make up Belarus were officially referred to as "Belarus'" and "Belarusi", instead of the terms of "Rus'" and "Rusini". The spellings '''Belorussia''' and '''Byelorussia''' are transliterations of unofficial alternative names of the country in [[Russian (spelling)|Russian]]. 

Belarus was named "Belorussia" in the days of [[Imperial Russia]], and the Russian [[tsar]] was usually styled "Emperor of [[All the Russias]] — [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Russia|White]]". This practice continued throughout the [[Soviet era]], with the country taking the official name of the "[[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]". Some Belarusians object to the name "Byelorussia", as an unwelcome reminder of the days under Russian and Soviet rule.<ref name="byelorussia">Pravapis.org [http://www.pravapis.org/art_belarusian_adjective.asp Uses and spellings of the word ''Belarusian''].

In 2002, an informal survey was conducted by the Web site [http://pravapis.org/ pravapis.org] to see which version of the name was used on a majority of Web sites. By using Google, Pravapis.org looked up various terms and it found that "Belarus", the official short form of the name, was used on 93% of Web sites checked.  Other spellings used included "Belorussia", "Bielorussia" and "Byelorussia," which were used in 1%&ndash;2% of cases.<ref name="spelling">{{cite web| url=http://www.pravapis.org/art_belarus_name.asp| title=The 21 Names of Belarus| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Belarus}}

[[Image:Vitebesk after Soviet recapture.jpg|thumb|The city of Vitebesk after the Soviet Army recapture in 1944 during [[World War II]]]].
Between the 6th and the 12th centuries, what is now known as Belarus was settled by the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], who still dominate the country. The [[Early East Slavs]] gradually came into contact with the [[Varangians]] and were organized by them under the state of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']]. 

In the 13th century, several of the separate Ruthenian duchies were badly affected by a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion. Later, parts of Rus were swallowed up by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/grandduchy.htm</ref> The core lands of the duchy were [[Samogitia]] and the territories around [[Kernavė]], [[Alytus]], [[Utena]], [[Daugavpils]], [[Ashmyany]], [[Lida]], and [[Vilnius]]. During this time, the Belarusian territories were largely at peace, but the Lithuanian duchy was often at war and had famous victories against the [[Mongols]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and the [[Teutonic Knights]]. By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania stretched across much of [[Eastern Europe]], spanning from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]. 

On [[February 2]] [[1386]], [[Grand Duke]] of Lithuania [[Jogaila]] was crowned [[King of Poland]], and allied the Grand Duchy with [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in a [[personal union]] under one monarch. [[Polish-Lithuanian union|This personal union]] eventually resulted in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a [[federation]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]]. By [[1795]], the commonwealth [[partitions of Poland|was partitioned and annexed]] by [[Imperial Russia]], [[Prussia]], and [[Austria]]. Belarusian territories remained part of the [[Russian Empire]] until they were occupied by [[Imperial Germany|Germany]] during [[World War I]]. 

Belarus first declared independence on [[25 March]] [[1918]], forming the [[Belarusian National Republic|Belarusian People's Republic]]. The Republic, however, was short-lived, and the regime was overthrown soon after the German withdrawal. In [[1919]], Belarus became the [[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (BSSR). After Russian occupation of eastern and northern Lithuania, it was merged into the [[Lithuanian-Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. After the [[Polish-Soviet War]] ended in [[1921]], Byelorussian lands were split between Poland and the [[Bolsheviks]], and the recreated Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] in [[1922]].<ref>http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~MidLink/belarus/belarus.history.html</ref> 

In September [[1939]], as a result of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet Union invaded Poland]] and [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|annexed its eastern lands]], including majority of Polish-held Byelorussian land.<ref>http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/addsepro.htm</ref> In [[1941]], [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. Byelorussia was occupied soon after and [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany|remained in Nazi hands]] until [[1944]]. Over one million buildings were destroyed and the human lossses totaled over two million Belarusians.<ref>http://countrystudies.us/belarus/10.htm</ref> The [[History of the Jews in Belarus|Jewish population of Byelorussia]] was devastated during [[The Holocaust]]. The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971.

After the war ended, Byelorussia was among the 51 signatories to the founding of the [[United Nations]] in 1945. The post-war reconstruction brought comparative prosperity to the Soviet Republic. During this time, Belarus became a major center of manufacturing in the western region of the USSR. The increase in jobs brought in a huge immigrant population from the [[Russian SFSR|Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]].<ref name="Soviet-era">{{cite web| url=http://www.iexplore.com/dmap/Belarus/History|title=iExplore - Belarus History and Culture| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> 

Under [[Joseph Stalin]], a policy of [[Russification]] was started to "protect" Byelorussian SSR from influences by the West. <!--The plan was to have any trace of Belarus's cultural identity to be replaced by those of Russia.--> This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Belorussian SSR government. The official use of the [[Belarusian language]] and other cultural aspects were limited by [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Moscow]]. After Stalin died in [[1953]], his successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], continued the Russification program, stating, "The sooner we all start speaking [[Russian language|Russian]], the faster we shall build [[communism]]."<ref name="warpop"/> When Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] began pushing through his [[Perestroika]] plan, the Belarusian people delivered a petition to him in December 1986 explaining the loss of their culture. This event has been coined by historians as the "cultural Chernobyl". (Earlier that year, Belarus was exposed to [[nuclear fallout]] from the explosion at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] power plant in neighboring [[Ukrainian SSR]].)<ref name="Gorby">{{cite web| url=http://countrystudies.us/belarus/12.htm| title=Country Studies - Belarus - Perestroika| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> In June of [[1988]], [[mass graves]] were discovered at the city of [[Kurapaty]]. The graves allegedly contained about 250,000 of Stalin's victims. Some contend that this discovery was proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people, and caused some to seek independence.<ref name="massgraves">{{cite web| url=http://www.district87.org/staff/gordonr/russia/belarus.htm| title=Belarus Backgrounder| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref><ref name="Gorby"/> 
 
Belarus declared itself sovereign on [[27 July]] [[1990]], and the BSSR formally became the Republic of Belarus on [[25 August]] [[1991]], attaining full independence.  Around that time, [[Stanislav Shushkevich]] became Chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet]] of Belarus, the top leadership position in Belarus. Shushkevich, along with [[Boris Yeltsin]] of Russia and [[Leonid Kravchuk]] of [[Ukraine]], met on [[8 December]] [[1991]] in [[Belavezhskaya Pushcha]] to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Since 1994, the country has been led by [[Alexander Lukashenko]], who has been criticized by Western governments, [[Human Rights Watch]], and other Western [[NGO]]s for his Soviet-style domestic policies. 

There appears to be a movement in Belarus towards reuniting with [[Russia]].  In November 2005, a draft constitution was sent to both [[Vladimir Putin]] and Lukashenko for approval.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20051114-102844-6237r.htm|title=Belarus union moves forward| first=Michael| last=Mainville| journal=The Washington Times| month=November 15| year=2005}}</ref> This move, along with others, is part of the 1996 plan created by Lukashenko and former Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] to create a [[Union of Russia and Belarus|union between the two nations]].

Belarus is a [[republic]], governed by a [[Leaders of Belarus|President]] and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]]—the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus|National Assembly]]. The assembly is comprised of a lower house, the 110 member [[House of Representatives of the Republic of Belarus|House of Representatives]], and an upper house, the 64 member [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]]. The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the [[Prime Minister]] of Belarus, make constitutional amendments, call for a [[Motion of Confidence|vote of confidence]] on the prime minister, and make suggestions on the foreign and domestic policy of Belarus. The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and the ability to accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives.  Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the [[Constitution of Belarus]]. 

The Belarusian President since 1994 has been [[Alexander Lukashenko]]. The government is a [[Council (government)|Council]] of Ministers, headed by a [[Prime Minister of Belarus|prime minister]]. The members of the Council of Ministers need not be members of the legislature, and are appointed by the President. The judiciary is comprised of the [[Supreme Court of Belarus|Supreme Court]] and various specialized courts, such as the [[Constitutional Court of Belarus|Constitutional Court]], which deals with specific issues related to the constitution or business law. The judges of the Constitutional Court are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic.

In Belarus, while there are [[political party|political parties]] that either support or oppose President Lukashenko, the majority of the seats in the House of Representatives are filled by those not affiliated with any political parties ("non-partisans").  However, in constitutional as well as political terms, the House is of marginal importance. At the 2000 election, it took four rounds of voting before all the seats were filled; in the end, 86% of the elected deputies were independents, and the remainder were the representatives of parties traditionally loyal to the president (OSCE, 2000).  Three political parties currently have seats in the House of Representatives: the [[Communist Party of Belarus]] (8 seats), the [[Agrarian Party of Belarus]] (3 seats), and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus]] (1 seat). The other two parties that pledged their support to Lukashenko, the [[Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party]] and the [[Republican Party of Labour and Justice]], did not secure any seats in the October 2004 election. Opposition parties, such as the [[Belarusian People's Front]](BPF) and the [[United Civil Party of Belarus]] (UCPB) also did not gain any seats. The UCPB and the BPF are two of the parties that comprise the [[People's Coalition 5 Plus]], a group of political parties who oppose Lukashenko. Several organizations, including the [[OSCE|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)]], declared the election "un-free" due to opposition parties' negative results and the bias of the Belarusian media in favor of the government.<ref name="OSCE">{{cite web| url=http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2004/12/3951_en.pdf| format=PDF| title=OSCE Report on the October 2004 parliamentary elections| year=December 2004| accessdate=2006-03-26}} - 404 error as of last access date</ref>

The [[Belarusian presidential election, 2006|next round of elections]] took place on March 19, 2006, and included selecting the President. Lukashenko was opposed in the election by [[Alexander Milinkevich]], a candidate representing a coalition of opposition parties. Another opposition candidate, [[Alaksandar Kazulin]] of the Social Democrats was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the Lukashenko sponsored event, the [[All Belarusian People's Assembly]]. This event, among others, have caused for concern that the 2006 elections had irregularities.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4766024.stm| year=2 March 2006| title=Belarus rally marred by arrests| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> The incumbent President won a landslide victory, receiving over 80% of the vote.

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Subdivisions of Belarus}}
[[Image:Belarus.geohive.png|thumb|320px|right|[[Subnational|Administrative division]].]]
Belarus is divided into six [[province]]s ("[[voblast]]s"), named after the cities that serve as their administrative centers. The city of [[Minsk]], located in the Minsk province, has the special status of being a national subordinate, as it isn't included in any voblast. Subdivision into ''voblasts'' was inherited from the Soviet era. Voblasts are further subdivided into ''[[raion]]s'' (commonly translated as "[[district]]s" or "regions"). Local legislative authorities (''raisovet'', "raion council") are elected by the raion's residents. Local executive authorities (''raion administration'') are appointed by higher executive authorities. In the same way, each voblast has its own legislative authority (''oblsovet''), elected by residents, and an executive authority (''voblast administration''), whose leader is appointed by the President.

{{main|Geography of Belarus}}

Belarus is [[landlocked]], relatively flat, and contains large tracts of [[marsh]]y land. Lakes and rivers punctuate the country. The largest marsh territory is [[Polesie]], which is among the largest marshes in Europe. There are 11,000 lakes in Belarus, but the majority of the lakes are smaller than 0.5&nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (124&nbsp;[[acre]]s). Three major rivers run through the country; the [[Neman River]], the [[Pripyat River]], and the [[Dnepr River]]. Belarus' highest point is [[Dzyarzhynskaya Hara]] (Dzyarzhynsk Hill), 345&nbsp;[[metre]]s (1,132&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), and its lowest point is on the Neman River, 90&nbsp;metres (295&nbsp;ft). 

Belarus is home, along with Poland, to the ''Belaveskaya Pushcha'' (Белавеская пушча) or, by its Polish name, [[Białowieża Forest]], the only remaining, virgin part of the immense forest that once spread across the [[Northern European Lowlands|European Plain]]. 

The [[climate]] ranges from harsh [[winter]]s (average January temperatures are in the range −8&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]](18&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) to −2&nbsp;°C (28&nbsp;°F)) to cool and moist [[summer]]s (average temperature 15&nbsp;°C (59°F) to 20&nbsp;°C(68°F)). On average, 15 to 30 [[centimeter]]s of snow falls in the country, mostly in the northeast. Belarus experiences an average [[rainfall]] of 600 to 700 [[millimeter]]s with over 70 percent of the rain falling during the warmer periods of the year. Due to the weather patterns, [[natural disaster]]s such as [[drought]]s and [[flood]]s occasionally occur in Belarus. Between the period of 1881 until 2005, the average temperature of Belarus rose 1 degree Celsius, with temperatures rising significantly during the winter and spring months. It has been projected that Belarus will face a 3 to 4 degree rise in average temperatures when the twenty-first century ends.<ref>http://www.belarustourist.minsk.by/belarus/climate.html</ref>

Forest covers about 34 percent of the total landscape, making forestry products one of the most abundant natural resources in Belarus. Other natural resources found in Belarus include [[peat]] deposits, small quantities of [[petroleum|oil]] and natural gas, [[granite]], dolomite ([[limestone]]), [[marl]], [[chalk]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], and [[clay]]. 

About one-fifth of the territory, mostly in the southeastern provinces of [[Homyel voblast|Homyel]] and [[Mahilyow voblast|Mahilyow]], continue to be affected by fallout from the 1986 [[nuclear power plant]] disaster in [[Chernobyl]], [[Ukraine]]. While the amount of radiation has decreased since the disaster, most of the area is considered uninhabitable. Approximately 70 percent of the total radiation emitted from the Chernobyl plant entered into Belarusian territory.<ref name="Chernobyl">{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4485003.stm| publisher=BBC News| title=Belarus cursed by Chernobyl| first=Sarah| last=Rainsford| year=April 26 2005| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

Belarus is bordered by the following nations: Latvia (north), Lithuania (northwest), Poland (west), Russia (north and east) and Ukraine (south). Since its departure from the Soviet Union, Belarus signed a treaty with Latvia and Lithuania to [[demarcate]] the boundaries between the three countries. Ukraine signed a similar agreement with Belarus, though ratification on the Belarusian side is pending.<ref>http://www.gkpv.gov.by/en/state_border_en/delim_history</ref> As of 2006, Belarus and Lithuania began to demarcate their border using water buoys.<ref>http://www.gkpv.gov.by/en/state_border_en/bord_dem</ref>

[[Image:Belarus und Heuwender im Einsatz.jpg|thumb|A Belarusian made tractor being used to farm.]]
{{main|Economy of Belarus}}
The Belarusian [[Economic system|economy]] remains mostly [[state intervention|state-controlled]], as in Soviet times. Over half of the business are state controlled and foreign ownership is under 4 percent.<ref>http://www.belstat.gov.by/homep/en/indicators/labor.htm</ref> The country is relatively stable economically, but depends to a large extent on raw material supplies, such as oil, from its close ally [[Russia]]. [[Industry]] and [[agriculture]] remain largely in state hands. Belarus is therefore one of the very few remaining state-capitalistic national economies. Agriculture is dominated by collective farming, with major sub-sectors being the [[cultivation]] of [[potato]]es and [[Animal husbandry|cattle breeding]]. 

Historically important branches of industry include [[textile]]s and wood processing. After 1965, creation of heavy industry and [[mechanical engineering]] ([[tractor]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, etc.) significantly strengthened the country's development. Within the Soviet Union, Belarus was one of the most industrially-developed republics. Economically, Belarus involved itself in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), [[Eurasian Economic Community]], and [[Union of Russia and Belarus|Union with Russia]]. Soon after 1990, industrial production plunged due to the introduction of free market structures into the former Soviet Union. Economic growth returned in 1996, and in 2001 Belarus was the first CIS country to reach Soviet-era levels of industrial production and agricultural production. However, the Belarusian economy is heavily subsidized by Moscow in exchange for political submission and the suppression of a Belarusian national revival.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d78317fc-a04f-11db-9059-0000779e2340.html]</ref>

Gross domestic product (GDP) for 2005 was $79.13 billion (estimate), which equates to an annual income of approximately $7,700 dollar per head. In 2005, the [[gross domestic product]] increased by about 8-9%, with the inflation rate averaging about 8%.  According to the [[United Nations|UN]], average monthly income grew from US$20 to US$225 during the last 10 years.

Over four million people comprise the labor force in Belarus, with women holding slightly more jobs than men. In 2005, nearly a quarter of the population were employed in industrial factories. Employment is also high in agriculture, manufacturing sales, trading goods, and education. The [[unemployment]] rate, according to Belarusian government statistics, was about 1.5% in 2005. The number of unemployed persons totaled 679,000, with approximately two-thirds being women. The rate of unemployment has been decreasing since 2003, and the overall rate has been lower since statistics were first taken in 1995.<ref>http://www.belstat.gov.by/homep/en/indicators/labor.htm</ref> 

The currency of Belarus is the [[Belarusian ruble]] (BYR). The currency was introduced in May of 1992, replacing the [[Soviet ruble]]. The ruble was re-introduced with new values in 2000 and has been in use since.<ref>http://www.nbrb.by/Natiobank/Banknotes/ENG/index.html</ref> As part of the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]], there has been discussion between both states to use a single currency along the same lines as the [[Euro]]. This has led to the suggestion for the Belarusian ruble to be discontinued in favor of the [[Russian ruble]] (RUB), starting on [[1 January]] [[2008]], according to Russian news agency [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|ITAR-TASS]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.naviny.by/ru/content/rubriki/2-ya_gruppa/inter/29-01-06-01/| title=Russia-Belarus Union to have common currency starting from 2008| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> The banking system of Belarus is composed of thirty state owned banks and one privatized bank.<ref>http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/country.cfm?id=Belarus</ref>

The Belarusian economy has been impacted by the political situations inside the republic. The impact is mostly felt in the form of sanctions against the country or the leadership of Belarus. For example, the European Union adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 765/2006 on 18 May 2006. The Regulation provided for a freeze on the funds of President Lukashenko and between 30 to 35 high-level officials of Belarus. The sanctions also provided for travel bans for the aforementioned leaders. The sanction was imposed by the EU after the nation-block declared that the 19 March 2006 elections were fraudulent and called for the crackdown on opposition groups.<ref>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/05/F70F8119-C1B0-410C-A9BF-790C0034F3C9.html website]</ref>

==Demographics==
[[Image:Belarus-demography.png|thumb|230px|Change in the population of Belarus (1992-2003).]]
{{main|Demographics of Belarus}}
The majority of the [[population]] of Belarus are native [[Belarusians]], who comprise 81.2% of the total population of 10,293,011 people. [[Russians]] are the second largest group, making up 11.4% of the population. [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]] account for 3.9% and 2.4% of the population, respectively. 

Languages commonly spoken in Belarus are [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]. Both are the official languages of Belarus. 

The population density is about 50 persons per [[square kilometer]] (127/sq.&nbsp;mi) and 71.7% of the total population lives in [[Urbanization|urban]] areas. Of the urban population, 24% live in [[Minsk]], the national capital and largest city.<ref name="demographics">{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bo.html#People| title=CIA World Factbook (2005) - Belarus - People| accessdate=2007-01-27}}</ref>

Most of the population, 69.7%, are between the ages of 14 and 64. Sixteen percent of the population is under 14, while 14.6% are age 65 or older. The median age of the population is 37. The average life expectancy for Belarusian citizens is 68.72 years; for males it is 63.03 years and for females it is 74.96 years. 

The literacy rate in Belarus (the number of people aged 15 and older who can read and write) is 99%, with men at 99.8% and women at 99.3%. The male-to-female ratio in 2005 was estimated to be .88 males to every female. 

Most demographic indicators for Belarus resemble other European countries, notably with both the population growth rate and the natural growth rate in the negative. The population growth is currently at −0.06%{{inote|CIA Factbook}} in 2005, with a fertility rate of 1.43. The population is also growing older, and by the year 2050, the majority of the population will be over the age of 50.<ref name="census">{{cite web| url=http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/idbpyrs.pl?cty=BO&out=s&ymax=250| publisher=US Census Bureau| title=Population Pyramid Summary for Belarus| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> The migration rate is +2.3 for every 1,000 people in Belarus.

According to the [[Save the Children]] international organization report (comparing 167 countries), Belarus has the highest rating for the quality of life for women and children among all countries in the former Soviet Union. Belarus ranked 16th for mothers' quality of life, 14th for a womans' quality of life and 20th for the quality of life for children. The closest former Soviet repbulics are [[Estonia]] (18th for Women's rank), [[Ukraine]] (21/31/26) and [[Russia]] (27/34/64).<ref name="savethechildren">{{cite web| url=http://www.savethechildren.org/publications/SOWM_2006_final.pdf| publisher=Save The Children| title=State Of The Worlds Mothers 2006| accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref>

Traditional Belarusian dress originates from the time of [[Kievan Rus]]' and over time, has been influenced by the cultures of its neighbors: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Aside from its predominantly Ruthenian roots, [[Belarusian cuisine]] is very close to Lithuanian. It is sometimes considered somewhat less rich and impressive than the cuisine of its imposing neighbors. However, this may result from the general lack of national identity, which still holds back the development of the nation. Coupled with the Russification projects of the Soviet government, it has also led to the loss of many culinary traditions over the last 100 years. 

Certain aspects of the Belarusian culture have been lost because of the [[Russification]] period. President Lukashenko has introduced laws that force [[radio]] and [[television]] stations to showcase a percentage of Belarusian talent daily, but it does not specify whether the performance has to be in the Belarusian or Russian language.<ref>http://www.data.minsk.by/belarusnews/052005/17.html</ref> The radio and television stations are state-owned, mostly controlled by the [[National State Teleradiocompany]] (TVR).

Musically, Belarus has a mixture of artists and styles, based on the language they use in their music. On the radio, Belarusian artists can be heard alongside Russian artists. Belarusian TV shows concerts, usually state run, featuring standard performers and military bands from Belarus. Famous rock bands from the country include NRM, Neurodubel, Ulis, Nowaje Nieba, and Krama. Several Belarusian acts perform in Poland and Lithuania, where the population of Belarusian speakers are very high. Poland is also the host of the Belarusian alternative music festival [[Basowiszcza]].<ref>http://www.freemuse.org/sw12630.asp</ref> Since 2004, Belarus has been sending artists to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref>http://www.tvr.by/eng/konkurs.asp</ref>

The Belarusian government sponsors many annual cultural festivals: "[[Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk]]", "Minsk Spring", "Slavonic Theatrical Meetings", International Jazz Festival, National Harvesting Festival, "Arts for Children and Youth", the Competition of Youth Variety Show Arts, "Muses of Niesvizh", "Mir Castle", and the National Festival of the Belarusian Song and Poetry. These events showcase talented Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, or actors. At these festivals, various prizes named after Soviet and Belarusian heroes are awarded for excellence in music or art. 

Several state holidays, like [[Independence Day]] or [[Victory Day]] draw big crowds and include various displays such as [[fireworks]] and [[Military of Belarus|military]] parades. Most of the festivals take place in Vitebsk or Minsk.<ref name="festivals">{{cite web| url=http://www.belarusembassy.org/belarus/culture.htm| title=Belarusian National Culture| publsher=Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in the United States of America| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

Belarus has four [[World Heritage Sites]], two of them shared between Belarus and its neighbors. The four are: the [[Mir Castle Complex]]; the [[Niasvizh Castle]]; the [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha]] (shared with [[Poland]]); and the [[Struve Geodetic Arc]] (shared with [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Norway]], [[Moldova]], Russia, [[Sweden]] and Ukraine).<ref name="UNSECO">{{cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/by| title=Belarus - UNESCO World Heritage Centre| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

==International rankings==
Every year, several non-governmental groups and international organizations release ratings that compare various nations to each other on issues of government corruption, freedom in the press, economic activity and women's rights.
