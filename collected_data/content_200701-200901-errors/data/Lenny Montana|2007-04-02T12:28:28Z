He was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] in [[1926]] of [[Italian American]] heritage. 6'6" in height and very heavily built, Montana was a professional [[wrestler]] during the 1950s and 1960s before he turned to acting.

Montana's first film appearance is probably his most memorable. He played the bodyguard [[Luca Brasi]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'' and despite relatively little on-screen time his performance was quite memorable. Brasi, according to [[Mario Puzo]]'s novel on which the film is based, is the one man whom his boss Don Corleone fears.

He starred in a number of other movies such as ''[[The Jerk]]'' (1979) and alongside [[Jackie Chan]] in ''[[The Big Brawl]]'' (1980), but retired after making his final movie, ''[[Blood Song]]'', in 1982.

Montana died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1992, 66 years of age.
