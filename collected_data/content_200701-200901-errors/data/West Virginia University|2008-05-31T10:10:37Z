'''West Virginia University''' is a [[coeducation]]al [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States of America|USA]]. Other campuses include: [[West Virginia University at Parkersburg]] in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]]; [[West Virginia University Institute of Technology]] in [[Montgomery, West Virginia|Montgomery]]; [[Potomac State College of West Virginia University]] in [[Keyser, West Virginia|Keyser]]; and a second clinical campus for the University's medical and dental schools at [[Charleston Area Medical Center]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]]. Since 2001, WVU has been governed by the West Virginia University [[Board of Governors]].<ref>[http://www.wvu.edu/~bog/powers.htm WVU.edu: Board of Governors - "Powers & Duties"]</ref>

Enrollment for the fall 2007 semester was 28,113. The University offers 179 majors in 15 colleges and has produced 25 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]]<ref>[http://about.wvu.edu/facts: WVU.edu: WVU Facts]</ref>, including former WVU president David C. Hardesty Jr. The University also has produced 30 [[Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship|Goldwater Scholars]], 19 [[Truman Scholar]]s, five members of ''[[USA Today]]'' 's All-USA College Academic First Team, and two [[Mo Udall|Morris K.Udall]] Undergraduate Udall Scholarship winners.<ref>[http://www.udall.gov/udall.asp?link=200 Morris K. Udall Foundation]</ref>

==History==
Under the terms of the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], the West Virginia Legislature created the Agricultural College of West Virginia on February 7, 1867.<ref>Doherty, William T. Jr. and Festus P. Summers. (1982) West Virginia University: Symbol of Unity in a Sectionalized State. Morgantown, West Virginia: West Virginia University Press, page 8.</ref> On December 4, 1868, lawmakers re-named it West Virginia University.<ref>Doherty, William T. Jr. and Festus P. Summers. (1982) West Virginia University: Symbol of Unity in a Sectionalized State. Morgantown, West Virginia: West Virginia University Press, page 11.</ref>

In the 1990s, WVU developed several recreational activities for the students, such as FallFest, a concert that welcomes students back to classes. In 1998 WVUp All Night launched to offer free weekend entertainment to students. A popular Student Recreation Center opened in 2001.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

WVU is designated as a Research University (High Research Activity) by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.<ref> [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=63&search_flag=true&ref=783&start=783&BASIC2005=16 Carnegie Classifications]</ref> Funding from external sources for total sponsored programs is $138 million.<ref> [http://about.wvu.edu/facts WVU Facts]</ref> WVU is affiliated with the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, dedicated to the study of Alzheimer's and other diseases that affect the brain.<ref>[http://www.brni.org/]</ref> WVU is also a leader in biometric technology research and recently became the Federal Bureau of Investigation's lead academic partner in biometrics research.<ref>[http://about.wvu.edu/recognition]</ref>

On [[April 13]], [[2007]], the Board of Governors voted 16-1 to elect Morgantown attorney [[Michael Garrison]] to succeed David Hardesty as the University's president.<ref>[http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&story_id=27530 ''Daily Athenaeum'' (April 16, 2007): "Garrison selected to be next WVU president", by Huong Le and Ry Rivard]</ref>  The Faculty Senate voted to work with Garrison, but approved a vote of no confidence in the search.<ref>[http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&story_id=28841 ''Daily Athenaeum'' (May 23, 2007): "Faculty Senate votes 'no confidence'", by Tricia Fulks]</ref> Garrison began work in July; his appointment officially began [[September 1]], [[2007]].<ref>[http://sundaygazettemail.com/section/News/2007071718 ''The Charleston Gazette'' (July 18, 2007): "WVU governors speed up takeover date for president"]</ref> 

Garrison's early initiatives, including move forward to build a campus child care center after three decades of discussion on the subject and working with the Board of Governors to approve the largest salary increase since 1993 won him praise from many faculty and staff members.<ref> [http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/21/w-va-school-leader-quickly-made-grade/ "W. Va. school leader quickly made grade: Highly criticized initially by faculty, he's popular now,"] by Berny Morson, ''Rocky Mountain News'', February 21, 2008</ref>. The Chronicle of Higher Education <ref>"The Lobbyist as President," by Paul Fain, Chronicle of Higher Education, February 15, 2008.</ref> and Inside Higher Ed <ref>[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/03/14/nontraditional "The Non-Traditional President," Insidehighered.com, March 14, 2008]</ref> profiled him as an example of a trend toward non-traditional university presidents.

WVU has been listed as one of the top "party" schools in the United States.  Most recently it was named the number one party school by Princeton Reviews 2008 edition of "The Best 366 Colleges. Interestingly this fact proudly stated by many of the students and regarded as a shameful truth by University officials who continue to call for changes in student behavior." <ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003845870_party21.html Nation & World | Top party school: West Virginia | Seattle Times Newspaper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Colleges and schools==

===Forensics program===
In addition to its 15 colleges/schools, WVU also has a nationally recognized [[forensic science]] program. Originally created through a partnership with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the program is accredited by the [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]] and is the official library holdings repository for the [[International Association for Identification]].

The program focuses on these aspects of forensics:

*[[Forensic accounting]] and [[fraud]]
*[[Forensic entomology]]
*[[Bloodstain pattern analysis]] and Biological Evidence aging
*[[Criminology]] and Investigative Science
*[[Dactylography]] and Fractal Analysis of Fingerprints
*[[Forensic toxicology]]
*[[Forensic odontology]]
*[[Computer forensics]] and Database Research
*Forensic Textile Research

Forensic facilities include "crime-scene" houses and vehicles that can be altered and adapted to give students hands-on experience, as well as traditional laboratories and classrooms which are now housed in the recently renovated Ming Hsieh Hall adjacent to Ogelbay Hall. A separate Criminology & Investigative Sciences major was later added and is now one of the more popular majors at West Virginia University.

==Libraries==
[[Image:WVRHClogo.gif|right|150px]]

The University maintains seven libraries on its campuses (six of which are in Morgantown and the other in Charleston). These include the Downtown Campus Library, Evansdale Library, Health Sciences Library, Law Library, Math Library, Media Services, and the WVU Charleston Health Sciences Library. Collections include the Appalachian Collection, Book Depository, Digital Collections, Government Documents, West Virginia Historical Art Collection, Map Room, Myers Collection, Patent and Trademarks, Rare Books Collections, and Theses and Dissertations. West Virginia University libraries contain nearly 1.5 million printed volumes, 2.3 million microforms, more than 10,000 electronic journals, and computers with high speed Internet access.<ref>[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/friends/ West Virginia Collection Welcome Page]</ref>

In addition, the [[West Virginia and Regional History Collection]], the world's largest collection of West Virginia related research material, is in the Wise Library on the Downtown Campus. According to the university<ref>[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/collections/wv.htm West Virginia Collection General Information]</ref>, the collection includes over 4,500,000 [[manuscript]] documents, 30,000 books, 15,000 pamphlets, 1,200 [[newspapers]], 100,000 [[photographs]] and prints, 5,000 maps, and 25,000 [[microfilm]]s, [[oral histories]], films and [[folk music]] recordings. It is often called simply the "West Virginia Collection." 

In 2007, the Princeton Review ranked West Virginia University libraries 5th best of 366 college libraries surveyed.

The university co-publishes, with the [[United Association for Labor Education]], ''[[Labor Studies Journal]]''.

==Campus==
The Morgantown campus comprises three sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is in the Monongahela River valley on the fringes of Morgantown.  This part of campus includes eight academic buildings on the National Register of Historic Places.  The Downtown Campus comprises of several architectural styles predominantly featuring red brick including Victorian Second Empire, Federal, Neoclassical, and Collegiate Gothic among others. The Evansdale Campus, a mile and a half north/northwest, on a rise above the flood plain of the [[Monongahela River]], was developed in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate a growing student population, since space for expansion was limited at the Downtown Campus. The Health Sciences Campus, in the same outlying area (but on the other side of a ridge), includes the WVU Health Sciences Center, Ruby Memorial Hospital, Chestnut Ridge Hospital, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, UHA Physicians Office Center, Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute and, WVU Eye Institute, WVU Center on Aging, and WVU Children's Hospital.

The Health Sciences Campus is located near [[Mountaineer Field]] on the Evansdale Campus of WVU.

==Campus Transportation==
===Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit===
{{main|Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit}}
Because of WVU's distributed campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, and Health Sciences), the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|Personal Rapid Transit]] system, which has become a local showpiece, was built to link them. [[Boeing]] began construction on the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]] in 1972. The unique aspect that makes the system "personal" is that a rider can tell the system which station is the destination and then he/she will be directed to a car that is bound only for that station.

The WVU PRT began operation in 1973, with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s daughter, Tricia, aboard one of five prototype cars for a demonstration ride.<ref name="prt">[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4104/ WVU News and Information Services (July 13, 2004 press release): "WVU PRT Station to Bear Name of People-Mover's Creator"]</ref>. The PRT handles 16,000 riders per day (as of 2005) and uses approximately 70 cars. [There was an interruption in service during the 1978/1979 school year to allow system expansion from the Engineering station to new stations at the "Towers" dormitories and the WVU Medical Center. During this time, WVU provided bus service between campuses.] 

The system has 8.7 miles (approx. 14 km) of guideway track and five stations: Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical/Health Sciences. The vehicles are rubber-tired, but the cars have constant contact with a separate electrified rail. [[Steam]] heating keeps the elevated guideway free of snow and ice. To board the PRT, a rider can pay a nominal fare at the station or swipe his/her Mountaineer Card, which also functions as a school debit card, library card, and unlimited transit pass. Although most students use the PRT, this technology has not been replicated at other sites for various reasons, including the high cost of maintaining the heated track system in winter.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}  

The PRT cars are painted in the school colors (blue with gold trim) and feature the University name and logo on the front. Inside, the seats are light beige [[fiberglass]] and the carpeting is blue. Each car has eight seats with an overall capacity of 20 people, including standing room. 

The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] named the WVU PRT one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972,<ref name="prt" /> and in 1998 ''The New Electric Railway Journal'' picked the WVU PRT over [[PeopleMover|Walt Disney World's monorail]] as the greatest people mover in the United States.<ref name="prt" />

In 2006, the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] dubbed WVU one of the best workplaces for commuters.<ref>[http://www.nis.wvu.edu/2006/workplace_award.htm "WVU Named One of 'Best Workplaces' for Commuters by EPA, DOT]</ref>

===Buses and Shuttles===
In addition to the PRT system, students can utilize University-operated buses (during limited hours) or take advantage of the community's Mountain Line, which operates every day into the early morning hours. Students can use their Mountaineer Card to ride the Mountain Line bus for free. 

The Health Science Center also operates a shuttle service to help students, visitors and patients to get to and from the Health Science Center campus. Many non-University, private student housing communities in the area also operate a shuttle to campus/town and back to the housing community. 

Each autumn, during Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is placed in front of the [[MountainLair]] [[student activity center|student union]] where groups of students participate in the "PRT Cram" with the objective of squeezing in as many people as possible. A record of 97 was set in 2000.<ref name='wolfe2005'>{{cite news | first=Billy | last=Wolfe | coauthors= | title=PRT Cram | date=[[2005-11-01]] | publisher= | url =http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&story_id=19842 | work =The Daily Athenaeum | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-06 | language = }}</ref>

==Residential Education==
[[Image:Boreman Hall South.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Boreman Hall]], one of the oldest residence halls on campus.]]
The Residential Education Program (ResEd), enacted in 1995, promotes "student success by easing the transition from high school to college and to personalize the freshman experience."<ref>[http://admissions.wvu.edu/undergraduate/discover/resident_faculty.asp WVU Admissions Dept.]</ref>  During the Move-In or Welcome Weekend, returning upperclassmen volunteer to help the new students and are known as Residential Education HOTSHOTS. They help carry items, give directions, and answer questions. 

ResEd and the WVU First-Year Experience (FYE) focus on the university's 14 [[residence halls]]. Each hall is assigned a resident faculty leader (RFL, pronounced "riffle") who oversees programming and lives in a house, usually next to the hall, where students hold Hall Council meetings and other events. Each hall is also assigned a residence hall coordinator (RHC) who works with the RFL and is responsible for daily operations, including enforcement of hall regulations. Along with these two positions are resident assistants (RAs) in most halls, graduate assistants (GAs)in some halls, and resident tutors (RTs) in Stalnaker and Lincoln Halls. All three groups comprise students who have lived in the residence halls for at least one year and are responsible for the daily operations of one floor or area. In addition to this 24-hour staff, WVU Police Department officers are stationed in or nearby the halls at certain hours to deter any criminal activity and to provide necessary resources and assistance to the students and staff.

All residence halls offer peer tutors or other tutoring programs to assist students having academic difficulties.

The university recently announced the construction of a new residence hall next to Summit Hall on it's downtown campus. The residence hall will be similar in design and operation to the newly created Lincoln Hall.

==Fraternity and sorority life==
About 10 percent of West Virginia's students are involved in Greek life. Many of the fraternity houses are on High Street or North Spruce Street, while sorority houses are mainly on Spruce Street and Prospect Street. 

According to the University, there are 17 fraternities and 8 sororities at WVU. Following is a list of those that belong to the Inter-Fraternity Council and the [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (sororities).  <ref>[http://www.arc.wvu.edu/NSS/AdmissionsFAQ/studentactivities.html WVU :: Undergraduate Student Recruitment - Admissions FAQ: Student Activities<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In recent years, many of the houses, as noted on the list, have been closed or condemned for various reasons.  

Recently West Virginia University has begun purchasing some of the fraternity houses located near campus. This is a small step in a several year plan, which when complete, will leave the University in control of many of the Greek organizations. The plan has both pros and cons. The Greek organizations who are finding it more and more difficult to maintain their houses according to Morgantown City Code are getting the repairs and financial support they need. In return the University is able to govern their behavior.

==Student newspaper==
''The Daily Athenaeum'', nicknamed the ''DA'', is the 10th-largest newspaper in West Virginia{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Offered free around campus, it generates income through advertisements. The paper began in 1887 as a weekly [[literary magazine]], with writing, editing and production taken over by the newly formed School of Journalism in the 1920s. In 1970, the paper split from the School of Journalism and became an independent campus entity governed by the Student Publications Board. The ''DA'' was voted as the ''[[Princeton Review]]'s'' 10th-best college newspaper in the United States in 2005, 15th in 2006, and 8th in 2007.<ref>[http://www.princetonreview.com Princeton Review Homepage (Login Required)]</ref>

== Athletics ==
{{main|West Virginia Mountaineers}}
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Big East new.gif|thumb|left|Big East Conference logo]] -->

The school's sports teams are called the Mountaineers and compete in the [[Big East Conference]], a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I.  The school has teams in 13 college sports and has won several national championships, including 13 [[NCAA Rifle Championship]]s as of 2007.<ref>[http://www.ncaasports.com/rifle/history NCAA Sports: Rifle History]</ref>

Notable athletes from West Virginia University include Stan "The Man" Boskovich, [[Jim Braxton]], [[Marc Bulger]], [[Avon Cobourne]], [[Mike Compton]], [[Noel Devine]], [[Cecil Doggette]], [[Mike Gansey]], [[Major Harris]], [[Chris Henry]], [[Johannes Herber|Joe Herber]], [[Jeff Hostetler]], [[Sam Huff]], [[Rod Hundley|"Hot Rod" Hundley]], [[Pacman Jones|Adam "Pacman" Jones]], [[Joe Stydahar]], [[Dan Mozes]],  [[Kevin Pittsnogle]], [[Jerry Porter]], [[Todd Sauerbrun]], [[Steve Slaton]], [[Rod Thorn]], [[Mike Vanderjagt]],[[Jerry West]], [[Pat White]], [[Quincy Wilson]], and [[Amos Zereoue]];  wrestlers Nate Carr, [[Greg Jones]], [[Mike Mason]], [[Joe Alexander]]; and [[Georgann Wells]], the first female player to register a dunk in a collegiate basketball game.<ref>[http://www.wvculture.org/HISTORY/sports/wellsgeorgeann02.html ''Morgantown Dominion Post'' (Dec. 23, 1984): "Wells Encores With School Scoring Mark" (unbylined), via West Virginia Division of Culture and History]</ref>

===Sports traditions===
====Flying WV====
[[Image:WestVirginiaMountaineers.png|thumb|right|The "Flying WV"]]
West Virginia University's logo is known as the "Flying WV."

====Mountaineer mascot====
The Mountaineer was adopted in 1890 as the official school mascot and unofficial began appearing and sporting events in 1927. The new Mountaineer is selected each year by the Mountain Honorary during the final two men's home basketball games. Candidates must have at least a 2.5 GPA, write an essay about why they want to be the Mountaineer, attend an extensive interview process and garner the most cheers during the home basketball game. The successful candidate is awarded the formal title of "The Mountaineer of West Virginia University." Although men typically are chosen, there has one woman selected (Natalie Tennant). The new Mountaineer receives a scholarship, a tailor-made buckskin suit with coonskin hat, and a period rifle and powder horn for discharging when appropriate and safe. The mascot travels with most sports teams throughout the academic year. There is always a backup Mountaineer, to step in when needed.

===="Take Me Home, Country Roads"====
The [[John Denver]] song "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]" is commonly played at most home sporting events as well as other occasions on campus. In 1980, Denver helped dedicate the new Mountaineer Field, and performed the song as a sing-along with the crowd. It then became a tradition, after a victory, for fans to stay in the stands and sing it along with the football team.<ref>''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (month n.a., 2006): "102 More Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate"</ref>
[[Image:sugar bowl06.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Pride of West Virginia at the 2006 Nokia Sugar Bowl]]

====Mountaineer Marching Band====
The [http://www.wvuband.org WVU Marching Band], nicknamed "The Pride of West Virginia," was formed in 1901 as an all-male [[ROTC]] band. It performs at every home football game and makes other appearances on- and off-campus throughout the year.

During its traditional pre-game performance, the band enters [[Mountaineer Field]] from end-zone tunnels to a spirited, 220-beats per minute "run on" cadence. The band plays several university songs and favorites including: "Fight, Mountaineers," "Mountain Dew," "Simple Gifts" (from ''[[Appalachian Spring]]''), "West Virginia University's Alma Mater," "The Star Spangled Banner," "Country Roads," and "Hail West Virginia!" The band also forms several iconic images during its pre-game show including the [[#Flying WV|Flying WV]], WVU, expanding circles, and an outline of the state of [[West Virginia]]. Each season's pre-game show is unique. 

WVU's marching band is one of the few to include a male baton twirler.<ref>[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4324/ WVU news release] on Mountaineer Band twirlers</ref>

In 1997, the WVU band was awarded the [[Sudler Trophy]] by the [[John Philip Sousa Foundation]].

====Fight song====
"Hail, West Virginia" is the university fight song.  It was composed by WVU alumni Earl Miller and Ed McWhorter in 1915.  The lyrics were written by Fred B. Deem, who later became a lawyer in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]]. The Mountaineer Marching Band performs the second verse of "Hail, West Virginia" as part of its pre-game performance at [[West Virginia Mountaineers|Mountaineer]] football games.

====Carpet Roll====

In 1955, Fred Schaus and Alex Mumford devised the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for Mountaineer basketball players to use when taking the court for pre-game warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue basketball. The University continued this tradition until the late 1960s when it died out, but former Mountaineer player [[Gale Catlett]] reintroduced the carpet when he returned to West Virginia University in 1978 as head coach of the men's basketball team.

==Allegation of academic fraud==

On April 24, 2008, the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' revealed that the university had improperly granted an [[MBA]] degree to [[Heather Bresch]], the daughter of the state's governor [[Joe Manchin]] and an employee of [[Mylan]], Inc., the university's largest donor.
