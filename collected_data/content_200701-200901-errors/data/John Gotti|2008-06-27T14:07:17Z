'''John Joseph Gotti, Jr.''' ([[October 27]], [[1940]] &ndash; [[June 10]], [[2002]]), commonly known by the [[Mass media|media]] as "The Dapper Don" and "The Teflon Don", was the [[crime boss|boss]] of the [[Gambino crime family]], one of the [[Five Families]] in [[New York City]] after the murder of his former boss [[Paul Castellano]]. He became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style that eventually caused his own downfall. In 1992, Gotti was convicted of [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|racketeering]], 13 [[murder]]s, [[obstruction of justice]], [[hijacking]], [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder, [[illegal gambling]], [[extortion]], [[tax evasion]] and [[loansharking]] among others largely helped by testimony of his Underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore Gravano]], and sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] without the possibility of parole, where he would eventually die in 2002.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
John Joseph "Johnny Boy" Gotti Jr. was born [[October 27]], 1940 to Italian-American parents John Gotti Sr. and Philomena "Fannie" Gotti. He was the fifth child of thirteen, two of whom died in infancy. When Gotti was twelve, his family moved to [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]]. With his brothers [[Peter Gotti|Peter]] and [[Richard V. Gotti|Richard]], he became part of a local street gang.
In the early summer of 1954, while trying to steal a cement mixer, the mixer tipped over, crushing Gotti's foot.

===Family===      
In 1962, Gotti married Victoria DiGiorgio. They had five children; Angela (Angel),[[Victoria Gotti]], [[John A. Gotti]], Frank Gotti, and Peter Gotti. John and his family lived on 85th Street in [[Howard Beach, New York|Howard Beach]]. According to sources,{{who?}} Gotti may have up to three illegitimate children.

On [[March 18]], [[1980]], his 12-year old son, Frank, while riding a mini bike around Howard Beach was accidentally knocked down and killed by neighbor [[John Favara]]'s car. Frank and Favara's son, Scott, were friends, often having [[sleepover]]s at each other's homes. Although the death was viewed as accidental by the authorities, Favara was kidnapped and murdered by eight members of Gotti's crew<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/gotti_8.html The Tragedy of Frank Gotti]</ref> while Gotti and his wife were conveniently out of town.<ref>[http://www.ganglandnews.com/column218.htm Who Killed John Favara?]</ref>

His daughter Victoria - along with her three sons, [[Carmine Gotti Agnello|Carmine]], [[John Gotti Agnello|John]], and [[Frank Gotti Agnello|Frank]]- starred in the [[reality TV]] series ''[[Growing Up Gotti]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405545/ Growing Up Gotti] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref>

===Rise in the Gambinos===
After his marriage, Gotti tried working legitimate careers. He worked as a coat factory presser and a truck driver's assistant, but he was always drawn back to a life of crime. In 1963, Gotti and Salvatore Ruggiero were arrested by police for being in an automobile that had been reported stolen from a rental car agency. Gotti spent twenty days in jail. Around this time Gotti was arrested often, mostly on petty crimes such as [[larceny]], [[burglary]], and [[bookmaking]]. In 1966, he spent several months in jail for an attempted theft. In 1966, Gotti also became an associate for a crew headed by reputed captain [[Carmine Fatico]], who worked for [[Aniello Dellacroce|Aniello "Mr. Neil" Dellacroce]], the underboss of the [[Gambino crime family]].

Gotti's criminal career with the Gambinos began with fencing stolen goods from [[Idlewild Airport]] out of the [[Bergin Hunt and Fish Club]] in [[Ozone Park, Queens]]. Gotti became successful enough at this lifestyle to move his family to a nicer apartment in Brooklyn. On November 27, 1967, Gotti and [[Angelo Ruggiero]] forged the name of a forwarding company agent and then took a rented truck to JFK's United cargo area and drove off with $30,000 worth of merchandise. A few days later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] began surveillance on Gotti and Ruggiero and caught them loading up more goods, this time at Northwest Airlines cargo terminal. Once outside the terminal Gotti's brother [[Gene Gotti|Gene]] pulled alongside Gotti's truck and they began to transfer the goods. The FBI swooped in and arrested all three men and found Gotti hiding in the rear of the truck behind some boxes.

In February 1968, United employees identified Gotti as the man who signed for the earlier stolen merchandise.  The FBI arrested him for the United hijacking soon after. Two months later, while out on bail, Gotti was arrested a third-time for hijacking--this time stealing a load of cigarettes worth $500,000 on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. Fatico urged Gotti to hire defense attorney Michael Coiro. Later that year Gotti pled guilty to the Northwest hijacking and was sentenced to four years at [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary]]. Prosecutors dropped the charges for the cigarette hijacking. Gotti also pleaded guilty to the United hijacking. Gotti spent less than three years at Lewisburg. After he was released from prison, he was placed on probation and ordered to find a legitimate job. Gotti was placed on the payroll of his wife's stepfather's construction company, where he reportedly never showed up for work but remained on the payroll.  Meanwhile he returned to his old crew at the Bergin club, still working under Fatico. When Fatico was indicted on loansharking charges, he used Gotti to oversee the day-to-day activities at the club. This helped get the attention of the Gambinos, specifically of Dellacroce, and, at the age of thirty-one, Gotti became acting [[Caporegime|capo]].  Gotti owned a Queens flea market with [[Genovese crime family]] wiseguys [[Joseph Galizia|Joseph "Joe Glitz" Galizia]] and Carlo DiPietro.  Eventually Gotti and Galizia decided they wanted DiPietro out of the business, and Galizia killed DiPietro. 

Gotti's crew, however, was caught selling [[heroin]] against the rules of the family and were to be disbanded and maybe killed.  Gotti and others in his crew organized the shooting of the Gambino family boss, [[Paul Castellano]], on [[December 16]], [[1985]]. Castellano was shot six times along with his [[bodyguard]], Thomas Bilotti, outside [[Sparks Steak House]] in Manhattan, and Gotti took control of the family. Gotti was arrested several times throughout his career, and although he served time in both state and federal prison (including a [[manslaughter]] conviction in connection with the shooting death in a tavern on [[Staten Island]] in 1973 of low-level [[Irish-American]] gangster James McBratney, who had kidnapped and killed [[Emmanuel Gambino]], [[Carlo Gambino]]'s nephew), in the 1980s he was referred to by the media as the "Teflon Don" as he avoided conviction on racketeering and assault charges. Gotti bribed or threatened [[jury|jurors]] in several trials. He also made use of police [[informant]]s to keep a step ahead of investigators.

===The last trial===
Gotti was long under intense electronic surveillance run by the FBI. His club, phones, and other places of business were all bugged. To get around this, he held meetings while walking down the street and played loud tapes of white noise. Eventually the FBI caught him on tape in an apartment above the club discussing a number of murders and other criminal activities. The FBI also caught Gotti denigrating his underboss, [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore "Sammy The Bull" Gravano]]. On December 11, 1990, FBI agents and New York City detectives raided the Ravenite Social Club and arrested Gotti, Gravano, [[Frank Locascio]], and [[Thomas Gambino]] ,
Gotti was charged with 13 counts of murder, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder, loansharking, racketeering, obstruction of justice, illegal gambling, tax evasion, and, for the first time, he was charged with the murders of Paul Castellano and Thomas Bilotti.

Gotti was tried in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] before the Honorable [[I. Leo Glasser]]. The federal prosecutor's evidence was overwhelming. Not only did they have Gotti on tape, but they also had several witnesses to testify against Gotti. [[Phil Leonetti|Philip Leonetti]], former underboss of the Philadelphia Crime Family, was prepared to testify that Gotti bragged to Philadelphia crime leaders that he had ordered Castellano's execution. Prosecutors also persuaded Gravano to testify against his boss with the promise of being entered into the [[Witness Protection Program]]. On [[April 2]] [[1992]], after only 13 hours of deliberation, the jury found Gotti guilty on all 13 charges.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/don_24.html John Gotti - The Last Mafia Icon - The Crime library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Prison===
On [[June 23]], 1992, Judge Glasser sentenced Gotti to life imprisonment without possibility of parole.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/don_24.html?sect=15 John Gotti - The Last Mafia Icon - The Crime library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He was sent to the older [[USP Marion|United States Penitentiary at Marion, Illinois]], where he was kept in a cell 23 hours a day. While in Marion, he had been confined along with convicted spies [[Jonathan Pollard]] and [[Christopher Boyce]]. Four days after John Gotti was imprisoned at Marion, his father, John Gotti Sr., died of heart failure at the age of eighty-five. Gotti paid the notorious prison gang the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] $50,000 a year for protection. However, in 1996 Gotti insulted Walter Johnson, a black inmate, on the prison yard with racial slurs. The black inmate later assaulted Gotti. Gotti felt completely disrespected and paid the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] $500,000 to kill his attacker. However, Gotti died of cancer soon afterwards, and the murder was never carried out.

===Death===   
Gotti died of [[throat cancer]] at 12:45 p.m. on [[June 10]], [[2002]] at the [[Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield|United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]], where he had been transferred once the cancer was diagnosed. His family claimed he had not received proper care in jail and that faulty dental work had aggravated the disease. Gotti had the lower half of his jaw removed due to the cancer and was fed through a tube. Following his death, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn]] announced that Gotti's family would not be permitted to have a [[Requiem|Mass of Christian Burial]] for Gotti. The church said that Gotti's family would be allowed to have a Mass for the Dead for Gotti only after he had been buried. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] had taken similar action against other organized crime figures  such as  [[Paul Castellano]]; but unlike Castellano, Gotti's family was permitted to have him buried in the mausoleum at [[Saint John's Cemetery, Queens|Saint John's Cemetery]] in Queens, next to his son Frank Gotti.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= John Gotti Dies in Prison at 61; Mafia Boss Relished the Spotlight |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E4DC1E3DF932A25755C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |quote=John J.

===Funeral===
The day after he died, Gotti's body was flown by a private jet to New York.  His body was dressed in a blue suit and placed into a solid bronze gold-coloured casket for two nights of visitation, June 13 and 14 at the [http://www.papaverofuneralhome.com/ Papavero Funeral Home] in Maspeth, NY.<ref name=funeral> Ruggeri, E.  ''Funerals of the Famous: John Gotti''.  The American Funeral Director. Vol. 131 (No. 5) May 2008, pp 46-53. </ref> The private funeral started at 10 a.m. June 15 in the funeral home.  Stretch limousines clogged the street in front of the funeral home.<ref name=funeral/> Hundreds of mourners crowded into the chapel, which was filled with giant floral tributes that would require [http://www.papaverofuneralhome.com/images/gottiprocession3.jpg 19 Cadillac flower cars to transport] to the cemetery.
