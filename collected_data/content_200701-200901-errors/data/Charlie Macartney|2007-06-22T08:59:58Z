'''Charles George "Charlie" Macartney''' (born [[June 27]], [[1886]], [[Maitland, New South Wales]]; died [[September 9]], [[1958]], [[Little Bay, New South Wales|Little Bay]], [[Sydney, New South Wales]]) was an [[Australian]] [[cricketer]] who played in 35 [[Test cricket|Tests]] between 1907 and 1926. He was known as ''The Governor-General'' in reference to his authoritative batting style. Macartney was a bowling all rounder when he made his Test debut in 1907, primarily a [[left arm orthodox spin]]ner complemented with right-handed batting. As his career progressed, he developed into a batsman, with his flair and strokeplay earning comparisons to close friend and role model [[Victor Trumper]], regarded as one of the most elegant batsmen in cricket history. He was a [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]] in 1922, and in 1921 scored an Australian record score in [[England]] of 345 runs against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] at [[Trent Bridge]] in under four hours. In 1926, he scored a century in the first session of a Test match, and retired at the end of a series in which he had scored three consecutive Test centuries. In retirement, he worked was a journalist and also returned to the [[Australian Defence Force]] during the [[Second World War]] as an official.

== Style ==

Macartney's flair was compared to that of Trumper, and his determination to that of [[Don Bradman]], universally regarded as the finest batsman in cricket history.<ref name="az"/> His style was quite different to that of Trumper, but generated fascination with his daring and supreme confidence. Macartney was described by Wisden as the being self-taught to a greater extent than anyone else in Australia or England in his era, calling him “a triumph to individualism…he is not a model to be copied” and ”one of the most brilliant and attractive right-handed batsmen in the history of Australian cricket”. His success was largely attributed to his eye, hand and foot.<ref name="wisden">{{cite web| title= Wisden 1922 - Charles Macartney |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154728.html| year= 1922 |accessdate=2007-05-31| publisher=-[[Wisden]]}}</ref> Macartney was a short man, standing 160 cm. He had an unusual trait of attempting to leg glance [[yorker]]s pitched on middle stump down to fine leg, and often lost his wicket in this manner. He was known for preferring candid criticism from his teammates rather than praise.<ref name="az"/> In later life he condemned modern batsmen stating “I can't bear watching luscious half-volleys being nudged gently back to bowlers”, while explaining why he no longer watched cricket.<ref name="obit">{{cite web| title= Wisden 1959 - Obituary - Charles Macartney| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/155483.html| year= 1959 |accessdate=2007-05-31| publisher=-[[Wisden]]}}</ref> [[Jack Fingleton]] noted that he had a strategy of aiming a shot early in his innings straight at the bowler’s head, in order to rattle them and seize the psychological initiative. Neville Cardus wrote that “there was always chivalry in his cricket, a prancing sort of heroism. The dauntlessness of his play, the brave beauty and the original skill bring tears to my eyes yet.”<ref name="az"/> 

Macartney was known for his authorative combative style, and his élan and devastating strokemaking led [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] cricketer [[Kenneth Hutchings]] to dub him the ‘’Governor-General’’.<ref name="az"/> On one occasion after reaching his century before lunch on the first day, he immediately called for a bat change. He selected the heaviest bat from the batch that his teammates brought out and then stated “Now I’m going to have a hit”.<ref name="pollard"/> He possessed powerful hands, strong forearms and broad shoulders. [[Leg spin]]ning team-mate [[Arthur Mailey]] recalled that Macartney would often hit him for [[six (cricket)|six]] in [[Sydney Grade Cricket]] matches. Grinning, he would say “Pitch another one there and I’ll hit you for a few more”. On the occasions when he fell attempting further long hits, his grin would remain, saying “Wasn’t it good fun”.<ref name="pollard">{{cite book|last=Pollard|first=Jack|title=Cricket the Australian Way|year=1969|pages=192-193}}</ref> 

Macartney was also a left arm orthodox spinner and bowled at a fast pace for a spinner, comparable to [[Derek Underwood]]. He was known for his consistent length and his well concealed faster ball which often caught batsmen off guard.<ref name="az"/> On sticky wickets, he was often incisive, helping him to take 17 five wicket innings hauls in his first-class career. He was known for his miserly attitude, often giving the impression that he would rather bowl ten consecutive maidens rather than take wickets and concede runs. This extended to his off-field activities, where he was considered careful and never wasteful with money. On the 1926 tour of England, he and Mailey visited a hat shop in [[London]]’s [[Piccadilly]] district which had a tradition of giving souvenir hats to cricketers of touring Australian squads. When asked if he would like a similar style to the gift he received in 1921, Macartney replied “Not on your life. I’ve been wearing this since you gave it to me in 1921.” <ref name="pollard"/>

In 1909, Australian team-mate Trumper moved from [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], a suburb in Sydney’s south shore to Chatswood on the northern side of the harbour. Macartney and Trumper played together for Gordon and became close friends. Macartney regularly practised on the Trumper family’s backyard turf pitch. Trumper’s relocation made more frequent meetings possible, since the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] was not to open until 1932, and the only way of travelling between either side was by ferry. Trumper was regarded as the “crown prince of the golden age of cricket”, the finest and most stylish batsman of his era, and one of the most elegant strokemakers of all time.<ref name="az"/> Under Trumper’s influence, Macartney became more audacious and adventurous. Macartney revered Trumper as a cricketer and as a person, and was a pall bearer when Trumper died in 1915 at the age of 37.<ref name="az"/>

== Early years ==
Macartney was taught to play cricket as a child by his maternal grandfather [[George Moore]], a slow round-arm bowler who had represented [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in three first-class matches against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]]. The equipment consisted of small handcrafted bat made from [[cedar]], and apples from the family orchard were used as balls. In his school career Macartney distinguished himself as an allrounder to [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra]] Superior and [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]] Public schools, before briefly attending [[Fort Street High School]]. It was during his school career that he was noticed by Australian captain [[Monty Noble]], who heaped praise on him in a newspaper article. After leaving school he worked for a produce merchant near the Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without pads on a wooden wharf during his lunch break.<ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =178-179}}</ref>

Macartney joined [[North Sydney]] in 1902 and then moved to the [[Gordon, New South Wales|Gordon]] club in the outer northern suburbs when it was formed in the 1905-06 season. He played regularly for them until 1933-34 when he was 47, amassing 7648 runs at 54.7. He was known for his dominant status at the Chatswood Oval. In one match he lofted a ball out of the oval, over the railway line into an adjacent bowling green, forcing the lawn bowlers to take evasive action. In 1905-06, he made his first class debut against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]], making 56 in the first innings and taking three wickets in the second. He made his Test debut against England in the Fifth Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in 1907-08.<ref name="az"/>

== Pre-war Test career ==

He was selected for the 1909 tour of England, his first overseas tour. At this stage of his career, Macartney was regarded as a bowling [[all rounder]]. He was only eighth on the batting lists with an average of 19, but took 71 wickets at 17.46.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/>  His bowling confounded the English team in the Thrid Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]], where he took 7/58 in the first innings and 4/27 in the second. His best innings and match analysis in Tests helped win the Test and retain [[the Ashes]]. His first Test century came against [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] in the Fifth Test in 1911, where he struck 137 and 56. It was his third century in as many first class innings.<ref name="az"/> He had made 119 and 126 in a state match against the tourists the previous week.<ref name="obit"/>

During the English tour of Australia in 1911-12 he only played in the fifth Test. Traveling in 1912 to England for the Triangular Tournament also including South Africa, he scored 2,207 runs during the tour at an average of 45.<ref name="wisden"/> 

On the 1912 tour of England he reached the peak of his all round performance totalling 2187 runs and 38 wickets for the tour.<ref name="az"/> He made six centuries, including 142 and 112 in one match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], but Wisden regarded the 99 in a drawn match Test at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] to be his finest innings of the tour.<ref name="wisden"/>  

During an unofficial tour of the Australian team to the [[United States]] in 1913 consisting of more than fifty games – Macartney scored 2,390 runs and took 189 wickets, topping both the batting and bowling averages.<ref name="wisden"/>

== Later career ==
[[World War I]] then interrupted Macartney's career as competitive cricket was cancelled. In January 1916, Macartney enlisted with the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian Infantry Force]] during the First World War. In July 1917 he was posted to [[France]] as a temporary warrant officer in the 3rd Division Artillery. In 1918 he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for gallantry. The death of his father later in the year caused his premature repatriation and prevented his appearance with the Australian Services team.<ref name="az"/>

Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920-21. He recorded his highest Test innings of 170 against England at Sydney in the series. He headed the Australian Test averages with 86.66 as Australia won the Ashes 5-0.<ref name="obit"/>

On the 1921 Ashes tour of England, he scored 345 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 232 minutes, with 47 fours and four sixes. After reaching his century, he called for a heavier bat. This still stands as the highest innings put together by an Australian in England, and at the time was the most runs scored by any batsman in one day. <ref name="obit"/> He headed both the batting aggregates and averages with 2317 at 59.41.<ref name="az"/> He was named as one of the 1922 Wisden Cricketers of the Year which stated that he was “by many degrees the most brilliant and individual Australian batsman of the present day”.<ref name="wisden"/>

In the Third Test at Headingley in the 1926 Ashes tour he became the second Australian to score a century before lunch on the opening day of a Test. Macartney was dropped in the slips in the first over and went on to make 112 by lunch and finished with 151. It was second of a hat-trick of Test centuries during the tour, after scoring an unbeaten 133 in the Second Test at Lord's. Macartney hit 109 in the Fourth Test at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]].<ref name="az"/> His average was 94.60 for the tour. Macartney decided to retire from Tests after the tour. He took part in twelve Test century partnerships, the largest being  235 with [[Bill Woodfull]] in the Leeds Test.<ref name="obit"/>

In 1935-36 Macartney was the vice-captain of [[Frank Tarrant]]’s side led by [[Jack Ryder (cricket)|Jack Ryder]] that toured India and he wrote forthright columns for [[The Hindu]].<ref name="az"/>

== Outside cricket ==
Macartney had married Anna Bruce at Chatswood Presbyterian Church in December 1921, and thereafter described himself as a civil servant while he was not engaged in cricketing activities. He also wrote for several Sydney newspapers, and between 1936 and 1942 wrote regularly for the [[Sydney Morning Herald]]. In 1930 he published the autobiographical ''My Cricketing Days''. During the [[Second World War]] he was a lieutenant in the amenities service of the [[Australian Defence Force]], and afterwards was a personnel officer at [[Prince Henry Hospital]]. Childless, he was predeceased by his wife, and died of coronary occlusion.<ref>{{cite web|title= Macartney, Charles George (1886 - 1958)| url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100192b.htm| publisher=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |year=1986| accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref>
