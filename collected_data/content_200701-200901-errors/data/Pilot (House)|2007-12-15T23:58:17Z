"'''Pilot'''" is the first episode of the television series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', which premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] network on [[November 16]], [[2004]]. It introduces the characters of Dr. [[Gregory House]] (played by [[Hugh Laurie]]) &mdash; a maverick antisocial doctor &mdash; and his team of [[diagnosis|diagnosticians]] at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro [[Teaching Hospital]] in [[New Jersey]]. The episode features Dr. House's attempts to diagnose a young grade-school teacher after she collapses in class.

"Pilot" was directed by series producer [[Bryan Singer]], who directed films such as ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', ''[[X-Men]]'' and later, ''[[Superman Returns]]''; the episode guest-starred [[Robin Tunney]] as House's first patient of the series.

==Plot==
Shortly after the start of class, kindergarten teacher Rebecca Adler ([[Robin Tunney]]) becomes [[dysphasia|dysphasic]] and soon falls to the floor. Dr. [[James Wilson (House)|James Wilson]] ([[Robert Sean Leonard]]) attempts to convince House to treat Adler, but House dismisses him, citing boredom. Wilson claims that the patient is his cousin. House agrees to take the case. Afterward, House is approached at the elevator by hospital administrator Dr. [[Lisa Cuddy]] ([[Lisa Edelstein]]), who attempts to persuade House to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task he loathes because of the uncomplicated nature of the cases brought to him. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him, and hurriedly leaves. Later, when House's team attempts to perform an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] on Adler, they discover that House's authorization has been revoked. House confronts Cuddy, accusing her of disrespect and risk to a patient's life. Cuddy grants him authorization for diagnostics in exchange for his required attendance in the clinic.

During the MRI, Adler's throat closes up, which forces Dr. [[Robert Chase]] ([[Jesse Spencer]]) and Dr. [[Allison Cameron (House)|Allison Cameron]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]])&mdash;two members of House's team&mdash;to perform a [[tracheotomy]]. House, while working in the hospital's clinic, treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his [[asthma]]tic [[inhaler]] only intermittently, instead of daily, as her son's doctor prescribed. The mother's reasoning is that the idea of children "taking such strong medicine so frequently" bothers her greatly. House sarcastically scolds her for making such a drastic decision without first learning more about asthma. During his rant on the effects of [[steroid]]s, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler with steroids; he diagnoses her with cerebral [[vasculitis]], despite having no proof. Adler temporarily improves greatly on the steroids.

On House's insistence, neurologist Dr. [[Eric Foreman]] ([[Omar Epps]]) breaks into Adler's house with Cameron to find anything that might account for Adler's symptoms&mdash;seizures; dysphasia; airway constriction; and positive, if transient, response to steroids. They find an opened package of sliced ham (which is not [[Kashrut|kosher]]) in Adler's kitchen, leading Foreman to reveal that Dr. Wilson had lied to House to convince him to treat Adler, because Wilson is [[Jew]]ish and Adler is not. House dismisses the lie and concludes that Adler is suffering from [[cysticercosis]] due to eating undercooked pork; the [[Cestoda|tapeworm]] inside of her reproduced, and its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. However, wishing to die with dignity, Adler refuses to accept more treatments unless there is evidence that the related diagnoses are correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an [[infarction]] in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had the correct diagnosis. House continues, claiming that death is inevitably ugly and that Adler cannot die with dignity, but still she refuses treatment. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for non-invasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection: using an [[X-ray]], House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and therefore her condition is treatable. After the revelation of this evidence, Adler happily agrees to take her medication, thus ending the case.

==Behind the scenes==
In the first scene featuring [[Lisa Edelstein]] and [[Hugh Laurie]], Dr. [[Lisa Cuddy]] (played by Edelstein) reprimands House for not performing the duties that the hospital administration expects of him; House reminds her that he has [[tenure]]. Laurie read this scene in the preliminary casting phase for an actor to play House. On the audition tape, Laurie apologized for his appearance; he was filming ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]'' at the time of the casting session.<ref name="Casting"> ''Casting Session with Hugh Laurie'' House DVD Special Feature, [2005]</ref> 

Producer Bryan Singer originally demanded that an American actor play House. Laurie's audition tape compelled him to rise out his chair to venture as close to the television screen as possible.<ref name="Concept"> ''The Concept'' House DVD Special Feature, [2005]</ref> Singer commented on how well this "American actor" was able to grasp the character; unknown to him at the time, Laurie is [[United Kingdom|British]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Reel.com |title=House, M.D.: Season One |url=http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=141135&PID=10120416&buy=closed&Tab=reviews&CID=18|accessdate=2006-10-03}}</ref> Singer later called Laurie's performance in the pilot "a little rough" in his attempts to find cadence and humor inside House.<ref name="Concept"> ''The Concept'' House DVD Special Feature, [2005]</ref> Laurie later stated that his original impression was that the show was about [[Dr. James Wilson]], because the script referred to him as a doctor with "boyish" looks. He assumed that Wilson was the star and Dr. House was the "sidekick". He did not realize that House was the protagonist until he read the full teleplay.<ref name="Inside"> ''Inside the Actor's Studio'' Hugh Laurie Interview, BRAVO Network, [2006]</ref>

Similarities between House and the famous fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] appear in the pilot. Each character has only one real friend (Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. Both come to rapid conclusions after the briefest examination of a client or patient, and both use drugs ([[cocaine]] for Holmes, [[hydrocodone|Vicodin]] for House). House and Holmes share the same address, 221B. The main patient in this episode is named Rebecca Adler, after [[Irene Adler]], a female character from the first Sherlock Holmes short story.<ref name="Holmes">{{cite web|work=House M.D. Guide to the TV Show|title=How Dr. Gregory House is like Sherlock Holmes|url=http://www.housemd-guide.com/holmesian.php|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Werts | first = Diane | coauthors = | title = 'House' thrives with inspiration from Sherlock Holmes | work = | pages = 1 | publisher = The Philadelphia Inquirer | date = September 4, 2006 | url = http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/magazine/daily/15434857.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref>

==Reception==
Like the rest of the series, the premiere was well received. ''USA Today'' praised the show for its blend of a ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' formula with a medical show, and its pairing of "a great actor with a great character", in reference to Hugh Laurie and Dr. Gregory House. It was also compared to its rival television series, ''[[Medical Investigation]]'', and seen as more character-driven than ''Investigation''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "plot-driven procedural".<ref>{{cite news | last = Bianco | first = Robert | coauthors = | title = There's a doctor worth watching in 'House' | work = | pages = 1 | publisher = USA Today | date = November 16, 2004 | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2004-11-15-house_x.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref> ''The New York Magazine'' called the series "medical TV at its most satisfying and basic", and stated that the cast consisted of "<nowiki>[professional]</nowiki> actors playing doctors who <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> care about their patients."<ref>{{cite news | last = Leonard | first = John | coauthors = | title = Scrub Par | work = | pages = 1 | publisher = New York Magazine | date = November 15, 2004 | url = http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/reviews/10331/ | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref> ''The Washington Post'' called Dr. House "the most electrifying <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> character to hit television in years", and Laurie's performance "perilously close to perfection".
