{{Alternative medical systems}}
'''Chiropractic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chiro-'' χειρο- "hand-" + ''praktikós'' πρακτικός "concerned with action") is a [[complementary and alternative medicine]] [[health care profession]] that focuses on [[diagnosis]], [[treatment]] and prevention of [[mechanical]] disorders of the [[musculoskeletal]] system and the effects of these disorders on the functions of the [[nervous system]] and general health.  It emphasizes [[manual therapy]] including [[spinal adjustment]] and other joint and [[soft-tissue]] manipulation.<ref name="ccestandards">{{cite web |url=http://cce-usa.org/uploads/File/2007%20January%20STANDARDS.pdf |format=PDF |title= Standards for Doctor of Chiropractic programs and requirements for institutional status |author= [[Council on Chiropractic Education]] |date=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> Traditionally, it is based on the premise that a [[vertebral subluxation]] or [[Vertebral column|spinal joint]] dysfunction can interfere with the nervous system and result in many different conditions of diminished health.

Chiropractors have historically fallen into two main groups, "straights" and "mixers"; both groups contain recent off-shoots.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/><ref name=History-PPC/> Significant differences regarding [[Scope of Practice|scope of practice]], claims made about spinal manipulation, and beliefs regarding professional integration, differentiate the various schools of thought and practice styles held within the profession.<ref name="Healey" />

== Philosophy ==

Traditional and evidence-based chiropractic belief systems vary along a philosophical spectrum ranging from [[vitalism]] to [[materialism]].  These opposing philosophies have been a source of debate since the time of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. Vitalism, the belief that living things contain an element that cannot be explained through matter, was responsible for legally and philosophically differentiating chiropractic from conventional medicine and thereby helping ensure professional autonomy.<ref name=Keating05>{{cite book |author= Keating JC Jr |chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic |pages=77–98 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> Chiropractic also retains elements of materialism, the belief that all things have explanations, which forms the basis of [[science]]. Evidence-based chiropractic balances this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] by emphasizing both the tangible, testable principle that structure affects function, and the untestable, metaphorical recognition that life is self-sustaining.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/> The chiropractor's purpose is to foster the establishment and maintenance of an organism-environment dynamic that is the most conducive to functional well-being of the person as a whole.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/> Principles such as [[holism]], [[naturalism]], therapeutic conservatism, [[critical rationalism]], and thoughts from the [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] and [[humanistic]] paradigms form an important part of the philosophy of chiropractic"<ref name=Phillips-PPC>{{cite book |author= Phillips RB |chapter= The evolution of vitalism and materialism and its impact on philosophy |pages=65–76 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref>

Chiropractors can adopt or share vitalist, [[naturalist]], or materialist viewpoints and emphasize a [[holistic]], patient-centered approach that appreciates the multifactorial nature of influences (i.e. structural, chemical, and psychological) on the functioning of the body in health and disease and recognizes the dynamics and interplay between lifestyle, environment, and health.  This holistic paradigm is also blended with a [[biopsychosocial]] approach, which is also emphasized in chiropractic care. In addition, chiropractors also retain [[naturopathic]] and naturalist principles that suggest decreased "host resistance" of the body facilitates the disease process and that natural interventions are preferable towards strengthening the host in its effort to optimize function and return to [[homeostasis]].<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/> Chiropractic care primarily emphasizes manipulation and other manual therapies as an alternative than medications and surgery.<ref>{{cite book |editor= Mootz RD, Hansen DT |title= Chiropractic technologies |publisher= Jones & Bartlett |date=1999 |isbn=0834213737 |author= Hansen DT, Mootz RD |chapter= Formal processes in health care technology assessment: a primer for the chiropractic profession |pages=3–17}}</ref>

Chiropractors also commonly use nutrition, exercise, patient education, health promotion and lifestyle counseling as part of their holistic outlook towards preventive health care.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |date=2000 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |title= A survey of practice patterns and the health promotion and prevention attitudes of US chiropractors, maintenance care: part I |author= Rupert RL |doi=10.1016/S0161-4754(00)90107-6 |pmid=10658870}}</ref> Chiropractic's claim to improve health by improving biomechanical and neural function by the manual correction of joint and soft tissue dysfunctions of the neuromusculoskeletal system differentiates it from mainstream medicine and other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) disciplines, but is also rooted, in part, in [[osteopathy]] and eastern medicine interventions.<ref name=Phillips-PPC/> All chiropractic paradigms emphasize the spine as their focus, but their rationales for treatment vary depending on their particular belief system.  

The philosophy of chiropractic also stresses the importance of [[Prevention (medical)|prevention]] and primarily utilizes a pro-active approach and a [[wellness]] model to achieve this goal.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |date=2000 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=10–9 |title= Maintenance care: health promotion services administered to US chiropractic patients aged 65 and older, part II |author= Rupert RL, Manello D, Sandefur R |doi=10.1016/S0161-4754(00)90108-8 |pmid=10658871}}</ref> For some, prevention includes a concept of "maintenance care" that attempts to "detect and correct" structural imbalances of the neuromusculoskeletal system while in its primary, or [[functional]] state.<ref>{{cite web |author= Canadian Chiropractic Association |title= Glenerin guidelines: preventive maintenance care |url=http://www.ccachiro.org/client/cca/cca.nsf/web/Chapter+14+-+Preventative-Maintenance+Care!OpenDocument |date=1996 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref> The objective is early identification of mechanical dysfunctions to prevent or delay permanent pathological changes.<ref>{{cite book |author= Vear HJ |editor= Vear HJ (ed.) |chapter= Scope of chiropractic practice |title= Chiropractic Standards of Practice and Quality of Care |location= Gaithersburg, MD |publisher=Aspen |date=1992 |oclc=23972994 |pages=49–68}}</ref>

[[Spinal manipulation]] is the most common modality in chiropractic care.<ref name=NBCE_techniques/> The medicinal use of spinal manipulation can be traced back over 3000 years to ancient Chinese writings. [[Hippocrates]], the "father of medicine" used manipulative techniques,<ref name=Swedlo>Dean C.

=== Straight ===

''Straight'' chiropractors are the oldest movement. They adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D. D. and B. J. Palmer, and retain [[metaphysical]] definitions and [[vitalistic]] qualities. Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an [[Innate intelligence]] within the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for almost any disease. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for treatment. Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not "mix" other types of therapies. Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon (i.e. perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment, etc.). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care.

''Mixer'' chiropractors are an early offshoot of the straight movement. This branch "mixes" diagnostic and treatment approaches from naturopathic, osteopathic, medical, and chiropractic viewpoints. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of the many causes of disease, and they incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ myriad treatments including joint and soft tissue manipulation, electromodalities, [[physical therapy]], exercise-rehabilitation and other complementary and alternative approaches such as acupuncture.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg>{{cite journal |journal= Arch Intern Med |date=1998 |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215–24 |title= Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |author= Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |pmid=9818801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215}}</ref> In contrast to straight chiropractors, mixers generally want to be integrated into mainstream health care via [[integrative medicine]].{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

== Scope of practice ==

== History ==

{{main|Chiropractic history|Vertebral subluxation}}

[[Image:ddpalmer3.jpg|thumb|left|275px|D.D. Palmer]]

Chiropractic (also known as Chiropractic Medicine) was founded in 1895 by Canadian-American Daniel David Palmer in Davenport, Iowa, USA. D.D. Palmer gave the first spinal adjustment to a deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard, on September 18, 1895, reportedly resulting in a restoration of the man's hearing.<ref name=Palmer1910>{{cite book |author= Palmer DD |title= The Chiropractor's Adjuster: Text-book of the Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic for Students and Practitioners |location=Portland, OR |publisher= Portland Printing House Co |date=1910 |oclc=17205743}}</ref> Palmer hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could result in improved neurological function and health.   Friend and Rev. Samuel Weed suggested combining the words ''cheiros'' and ''praktikos'' (meaning "done by hand") and chiropractic was born.

=== Vertebral subluxation ===

Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed "vertebral subluxations," interfered with the body's function and its inborn (innate) ability to heal itself.<ref name=History-PPC>{{cite book |author= Keating JC Jr |chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession |pages=23–64 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> D.D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ. D.D. Palmer, using a [[vitalism|vitalistic]] approach, imbued the term [[vertebral subluxation|subluxation]] with a metaphysical and [[philosophical]] meaning. He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.<ref name ="Forgotten Theories">Keating J (1995), D.D. Palmer's Forgotten Theories of Chiropractic, [http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf A Presentation to the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]</ref> This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic medicine from conventional medicine. In 1910, D.D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health: 

:"Physiologists divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, afferent and efferent. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality—too much or not enough action—which is disease."<ref name=Palmer1910/>

The concept of subluxation remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.<ref name=Keating-subluxation/> In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.<ref name=Keating-subluxation>{{cite journal |journal= Chiropr Osteopat |date=2005 |volume=13 |pages=17 |title= Subluxation: dogma or science? |author= Keating JC Jr, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF |doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-17 |url=http://chiroandosteo.com/content/13/1/17}}</ref> This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic (for example, [[Palmer School of Chiropractic]]<ref name="titlePalmer College of Chiropractic, General Information">{{cite web |url=http://www.palmer.edu/general_content.aspx?id=2630 |title=Palmer College of Chiropractic, General Information |accessdate=2008-03-24 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=}}</ref>) still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others (for example, [[Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]]<ref>[http://www.cmcc.ca/PDF/2006/CMCC_Calendar06to07.pdf PDF online]</ref>) have moved towards an [[evidence-based]] chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions but retains a holistic approach and an emphasis on manual therapy.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} As of 2005, the chiropractic subluxation was defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "A lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact.

=== Medical opposition ===

In [[1899]], a medical doctor in Davenport, USA, named Heinrich Matthey started a campaign against drugless practitioners. D.D. Palmer insisted that his techniques did not need the same courses or license as medical doctors, as his graduates did not prescribe drugs, perform surgery or evaluate laboratory diagnostics. However, in 1906, D.D. Palmer was convicted for practicing [[medicine]] without a license.  In response, B.J. created the Universal Chiropractic Association (UCA) for the purpose of protecting its members by covering their legal expenses should they get arrested for practicing medicine.<ref>Keating J. (1999), [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/17/25/09.html Tom Moore Defender of Chiropractic Part 1], ''Dynamic Chiropractic''</ref> 
[[Image:BJPalmer2.jpg|thumb|left|130px|BJ Palmer, Developer of Chiropractic, 1882-1961]]

Its first case came in 1907, when Shegataro Morikubo, DC was charged with unlicensed practice of [[osteopathic medicine]] in Wisconsin. Morikubo was freed using the defense that chiropractic [[philosophy]] was different from osteopathic philosophy.  The victory reshaped the development of the chiropractic profession, which then marketed itself as a science, an art and a philosophy.  This began a longstanding feud between chiropractors and medical doctors that would culminate in the mid 1980's in a landmark case, Wilk et al. vs [[American Medical Association]] (AMA). Until 1983, the AMA held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with an "unscientific practitioner", and labeled chiropractic "an unscientific [[cult]]".{{citequote}} In 1984, Joseph Janse, DC, ND, attempted to describe the divide in chiropractic and medical philosophy regarding prevention and patient care: 

<blockquote>
"Unless pathology is demonstrable under the microscope, as in the laboratory or by roentgenograms, to them [medical doctors] it does not exist. For years the progressive minds in chiropractic have pointed out this deficiency. With emphasis they [chiropractors] have maintained the fact that prevention is so much more effective than attempts at a cure. They pioneered the all-important principle that effective eradication of disease is accomplished only when it is in its functional (beginning) phase rather than its organic (terminal) stage. It has been their contention that in general the doctor, the therapist and the clinician have failed to realize exactly what is meant by disease processes, and have been satisfied to consider damaged organs as disease, and to think in terms of sick organs and not in terms of sick people. In other words, we have failed to contrast disease with health, and to trace the gradual deteriorization along the downward path, believing almost that mild departures from the physiological normal were of little consequence, until they were replaced by pathological changes…"<ref>Janse J, quoted in: {{cite book |author= Strang VV |title= Essential Principles of Chiropractic |location= Davenport, IA |publisher= Palmer College of Chiropractic |oclc=12102972 |date=1984 |pages= p. 26}}</ref>

===Wilk et al. vs. American Medical Association===
Chester A. Wilk, DC from Chicago initiated an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] suit against the AMA and other medical associations in 1976 - [[Wilk v. American Medical Association|Wilk ''et al.'' vs AMA ''et al.'']]<ref name="Sore Throat">Robbins J (1996),Medical monopoly: the game nobody wins - excerpt from 'Reclaiming Our Health: Exploding the Medical Myth and Embracing the Source of True Healing', ''Vegetarian Times'' [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n230/ai_18696325/pg_3 available online]</ref> The landmark lawsuit ended in 1987 when the [[US District Court]] found the AMA guilty of conspiracy and restraint of trade; the Joint Council on Accreditation of Hospitals and the [[American College of Physicians]] were exonerated. The court recognized that the AMA had to show its concern for patients, but was not persuaded that this could not have been achieved in a manner less restrictive of competition, for instance by public education campaigns.<ref name=Wilk/> A summary of the court's opinion concluded:
<blockquote>

"''Evidence at the trial showed that the defendants took active steps, often covert, to undermine chiropractic educational institutions, conceal evidence of the usefulness of chiropractic care, undercut insurance programs for patients of chiropractors, subvert government inquiries into the efficacy of chiropractic, engage in a massive disinformation campaign to discredit and destabilize the chiropractic profession and engage in numerous other activities to maintain a medical physician monopoly over health care in this country.''"<ref name=Wilk/>

On February 7, 1990, the AMA lost its appeal to the Supreme Court,{{Fact|date=March 2008}} and could no longer prevent medical physicians from collaborating with chiropractors.<ref name = Wilk>[http://www.chiro.org/abstracts/amavschiro.pdf Wilk vs American Medical Association Summary]</ref>

=== Movement toward science ===

In 1975, chiropractors joined medical and scientific attendees in a workshop sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]] on the research status of spinal manipulation. In 1978, the ''Journal of Manipulative & Physiological Therapeutics'' (''JMPT'') was launched.<ref>{{cite paper |author= Keating JC Jr |url=http://www.sherman.edu/research/rsch510/FaultyLogic-in-Chiro.pdf |format=PDF |title= Faulty logic & non-skeptical arguments in chiropractic |date=1997 |accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref> in 1983 the ''JMPT'' published an article advocating "a scientific institution with some capability for research" and was considered the beginning of the scientific chiropractic movement .<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |date=1983 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=147–50 |title= Notes from the (chiropractic college's) underground |author= DeBoer KF |pmid=6655376}}</ref>

<!-- **Move to a separate article? Summarize? Definitely need source referencing **
Under the direction of Dr.Rob Francis, Dean of Clinical Sciences at TCC, the full momentum swinging chiropractic into the orthodox health care delivery system was pioneered through Texas Chiropractic College (TCC), which led the way for chiropractic's entrance into mainstream medical acceptance of chiropractors practicing in the orthodox health care delivery system through the development of the first hospital rotation program for chiropractic students.
The first hospital rotation for chiropractic interns and the first certification course in Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) for chiropractors was developed in the 1980’s, by Dr. Rob Francis while Dean of Clinical Sciences at Texas Chiropractic College. 
After developing and implementing a hospital based clinical rotation for chiropractic interns at the Texas Medical Center in orthopedic surgery, Dr. Francis embarked on a mission to incorporate chiropractic services in the hospital setting by pioneering medical staff privileges for chiropractors. After successfully gaining full medial staff privileges for chiropractors at local Houston hospitals, Dr. Francis began to organize the academic programs to certify doctors of chiropractic in Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) and Hospital Protocol.
After Dr. Francis was certified and proctored clinically in Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) by board certified orthopedic surgeons, he was granted clinical privileges to admit patients to the hospital operating room for this procedure. Soon thereafter he developed a board approved MUA certification course for chiropractors that included hospital protocol, operating room proficiency and clinical proctorship in MUA under the auspices of the TCC Division of Post Graduate Studies.
The course became quite popular with a large number of chiropractors around the country seeking parity with medical physicians in the orthodox health care delivery system during the early 1990’s. Soon other colleges followed the TCC MUA model and began offering through post graduate programs the TCC-developed MUA certification course.
The hospital rotation program for chiropractic interns was developed during the same time period and became another TCC model for other colleges interested in providing chiropractic interns with the opportunity to rotate through hospitals and share chiropractic clinical models with their medical colleagues.
Dr. Francis initially personally selected the interns to rotate through the orthopedic service at the Texas Medical Center but soon the request by the medical staff and faculty for more chiropractic interns to rotate through services other than orthopedics allowed the program to expand to include rotations in family practice, internal medicine, radiology, neurosurgery, physical medicine and rheumatology. 
Towards an effort to shepherd this rapid expansion in a meaningful fashion, Dr. Francis recruited other TCC faculty members to participate in the hospital rotation program for TCC interns. The faculty involved in the hospital based program monitored the activity and interaction between the interns, medical students, medical school faculty and attending physicians at the hospital subsequently leading to the to development of didactic presentations at Hospital Grand Rounds to the hospital staff, medical school physicians and faculty at the medical center hospitals.
Presentations on the Rationale for Spinal Manipulative Therapy, Skeletal Radiology, Diagnostic Imaging and other clinical presentations were made by the TCC faculty leading the way for further expansion of the program.
Dr. Francis currently holds appointment as Clinical Assistant Professor of Family Medicine in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and has participated in federally funded research programs at the medical school to develop curriculum model for teaching CAM therapies to medical students.
Dr. Francis continues to teach the MUA certification courses around the country and has expanded the course to Europe teaching MUA to European chiropractors in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France.
The intern hospital rotation program continues to bridge the chasm of communication that once existed between the medical community and the chiropractic profession. -->

In chiropractic's early years, influences from both straight and mixer concepts were incorporated into its construct. Chiropractic has both [[materialism|materialistic]] qualities that lend themselves to scientific investigation and [[vitalism|vitalistic]] qualities that do not.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/>

In 1994 and 1995, half of all grant funding to chiropractic researchers was from the US Health Resources and Services Administration (7 grants totaling $2.3 million). The Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (11 grants, $881,000) and the Consortium for Chiropractic Research (4 grants, $519,000) accounted for most of the rest. By 1997, there were 14 peer-reviewed chiropractic journals in English that encouraged the publication of chiropractic research, including ''The Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics'' (''JMPT''), ''Topics in Clinical Chiropractic'', and the ''Journal of Chiropractic Humanities''. However, of these, only ''JMPT'' is indexed in [[MEDLINE]]. Research into chiropractic, whether from Universities or chiropractic colleges, is however often published in many other scientific journals.<ref>Chirofind.com [http://www.chiroweb.com/find/research.html Chiropractic Research]</ref>

While there is still debate about the effectiveness of manipulation for the many conditions in which it is applied, it seems to be most effective for acute low back pain and tension headaches.<ref name =Duke>McCrory DC, et al. (2001) ''Evidence Report: Behavioral and Physical Treatments for Tension-type and Cervicogenic Headache''.

When testing the efficacy of health treatments, [[double blind]] studies are considered acceptable scientific rigor. These are designed so that neither the patient nor the doctor knows whether they are using the actual treatment or a placebo (or "sham") treatment. However, chiropractic treatment involves a [[Spinal adjustment|manipulation]]; "sham" procedures cannot be easily devised for this, and even if the patient is unaware whether the treatment is a real or sham procedure, the doctor cannot be unaware. Thus there may be "observer bias" - the tendency to see what you expect to see, and the potential for the patient to wish to report benefits to "please" the doctor. Similarly, it is often difficult to devise a sham procedure for surgical procedures, but it is not impossible. It is also a problem in evaluating treatments; even when there are objective outcome measures, the [[placebo effect]] can be very substantial. Thus, DCs have historically relied mostly on their own clinical experience and the shared experience of their colleagues, as reported in [[case studies]], to direct their treatment methods. Consequently there has been a call to increase [[qualitative research]] studies that can better examine the whole chiropractic clinical encounter.

==== The Manga Report ====

The Manga Report was an outcomes-study funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and conducted by three health economists led by Professor Pran Manga. The Report supported the scientific validity, safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic for low-back pain, and found that chiropractic care had higher patient satisfaction levels than conventional alternatives. The report states that "The literature clearly and consistently shows that the major savings from chiropractic management come from fewer and lower costs of auxiliary services, fewer hospitalizations, and a highly significant reduction in chronic problems, as well as in levels and duration of disability."<ref name="manga">Manga P, Angus D.

==== Workers' compensation studies ====

In 1998, a study of 10,652 Florida workers' compensation cases was conducted by Steve Wolk. He concluded that "a claimant with a back-related injury, when initially treated by a chiropractor versus a medical doctor, is less likely to become temporarily disabled, or if disabled, remains disabled for a shorter period of time; and claimants treated by medical doctors were hospitalized at a much higher rate than claimants treated by chiropractors."<ref>Wolk S. (1988) An analysis of Florida workers' compensation medical claims for back-related injuries. ''J Amer Chir Ass'' 27:50-59</ref> Similarly, a 1991 study of Oregon Workers' Compensation Claims examined 201 randomly selected workers' compensation cases that involved disabling low-back injuries: when individuals with similar injuries were compared, those who visited DCs generally missed fewer days of work than those who visited MDs.<ref>Nyiendo J. (1991) Disability low back Oregon workers' compensation claims. Part II: Time loss. ''J Manip Physiol Ther'' 14:231-239</ref>

A 1989 study analyzed data on Iowa state records from individuals who filed claims for back or neck injuries. The study compared benefits and the cost of care from MDs, DCs and DOs, focusing on individuals who had missed days of work and who had received compensation for their injuries. Individuals who visited DCs missed on average 2.3 fewer days than those who visited MDs, and 3.8 fewer days than those who saw DOs, and accordingly, less money was dispersed as employment compensation on average for individuals who visited DCs.<ref>Johnson M. (1989) A comparison of chiropractic, medical and osteopathic care for work-related sprains/strains. ''J Manip Physiol Ther'' 12:335-344</ref>

In 1989, a survey by Cherkin ''et al.'' concluded that patients receiving care from health maintenance organizations in the state of Washington were three times as likely to report satisfaction with care from DCs as they were with care from other physicians. The patients were also more likely to believe that their chiropractor was concerned about them.<ref>Cherkin CD, MacCornack FA, Berg AO (1988) [http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1026519 Managing low back pain.

==== American Medical Association (AMA) ====

In 1997, the following statement was adopted as policy of the AMA after a report on a number of alternative therapies.<ref name="titleAMA (CSAPH) Report 12 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (A-97) Full Text">{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13638.html |title=AMA (CSAPH) Report 12 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (A-97) Full Text |accessdate=2008-03-24 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=}}</ref>  Specifically about chiropractic care it said,"[[joint manipulation|Manipulation]] has been shown to have a reasonably good degree of efficacy in ameliorating back pain, headache, and similar musculoskeletal complaints."
In 1992, the AMA stated "It is ethical for a physician to associate professionally with chiropractors provided that the physician believes that such association is in the best interests of his or her patient. A physician may refer a patient for diagnostic or therapeutic services to a chiropractor permitted by law to furnish such services whenever the physician believes that this may benefit his or her patient. Physicians may also ethically teach in recognized schools of chiropractic.

==== British Medical Association ====

The British Medical Association notes that "There is also no problem with GPs [doctors] referring patients to practitioners in osteopathy and chiropractic who are registered with the relevant statutory regulatory bodies, as a similar means of redress is available to the patient."<ref name=BMA_referrals>British Medical Association, "[http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/refcomtherap0406?OpenDocument&Highlight=2,Chiropractic Referrals to complementary therapists]"</ref>

== Safety ==

Chiropractic care in general is safe when employed skillfully and appropriately. Its primary therapeutic procedure, spinal manipulation, involves directed thrust to move a joint past its physiological range of motion without exceeding the anatomical limit. Manipulation is regarded as relatively safe, but as with all therapeutic interventions, complications can arise, and it has known adverse effects, risks and contraindications.<ref name=WHO-guidelines/>

Spinal manipulation is associated with frequent, mild and temporary [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]],<ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG/><ref name=Ernst-adverse/> including new or worsening pain or stiffness in the affected region.<ref name=Thiel>{{cite journal |journal=Spine |date=2007 |volume=32 |issue=21 |pages=2375–8 |title= Safety of chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine: a prospective national survey |author= Thiel HW, Bolton JE, Docherty S, Portlock JC |pmid=17906581}}</ref> They have been estimated to occur in 34% to 55% of patients, with 80% of them disappearing within 24 hours.<ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG/> Rarely, spinal manipulation, particularly on the upper spine, can also result in complications that can lead to permanent disability or death; these can occur in adults<ref name=Ernst-adverse>{{cite journal |journal= J R Soc Med |date=2007 |volume=100 |issue=7 |pages=330–8 |title= Adverse effects of spinal manipulation: a systematic review |author= Ernst E |pmid=17606755 |url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/content/full/100/7/330}}</ref> and children.<ref name=Vohra>{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2007 |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=e275–83 |title= Adverse events associated with pediatric spinal manipulation: a systematic review |author= Vohra S, Johnston BC, Cramer K, Humphreys K |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1392 |pmid=17178922 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/119/1/e275}}</ref> The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of these complications is unknown, due to rarity, high levels of underreporting, and difficulty of linking manipulation to adverse effects such as stroke, a particular concern.<ref name=Ernst-adverse/> [[Vertebrobasilar artery stroke]] is [[Association (statistics)|statistically associated]] with chiropractic services in persons under 45 years of age, but it is similarly associated with general practitioner services, suggesting that these associations are likely explained by preexisting conditions.<ref name=BJD-ES>{{cite journal |journal=Spine |date=2008 |volume=33 |issue= 4 Suppl |pages=S5–7 |title= The Bone and Joint Decade 2000–2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders: executive summary |author= Haldeman S, Carroll L, Cassidy JD, Schubert J, Nygren Å |doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181643f40 |pmid=18204400 |url=http://spinejournal.com/pt/re/spine/fulltext.00007632-200802151-00004.htm}}</ref> These strokes after manipulation appear to be unpredictable and are an inherent, idiosyncratic, and rare complication of cervical spine manipulation.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Spine |date=2002 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=49–55 |title= Unpredictability of cerebrovascular ischemia associated with cervical spine manipulation therapy: a review of sixty-four cases after cervical spine manipulation |author= Haldeman S, Kohlbeck FJ, McGregor M |pmid=11805635 |url=http://spinejournal.com/pt/re/spine/fulltext.00007632-200201010-00012.htm}}</ref>

Absolute [[contraindication]]s to spinal manipulation are conditions that should not be manipulated; these contraindications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and conditions known to result in unstable joints. Relative contraindications are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where low-force and soft-tissue techniques are treatments of choice; these contraindications include [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> Although most contraindications apply only to manipulation of the affected region, some neurological signs indicate referral to [[emergency medical services]]; these include sudden and severe [[headache]] or [[neck pain]] unlike that previously experienced.<ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG>{{cite journal |journal= J Can Chiropr Assoc |date=2005 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=158–209 |title= Chiropractic clinical practice guideline: evidence-based treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Blouin JS, Bryans R ''et al.'' |url=http://www.jcca-online.org/Client/cca/jcca.nsf/objects/jcca-v49-3-158/$file/jcca-v49-3-158.pdf |format=PDF}}<br/>&nbsp;• {{cite journal |journal= J Can Chiropr Assoc |date=2008 |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=7–8 |title= A clinical practice guideline update from The CCA•CFCREAB-CPG |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Bryans B, Descarreaux M ''et al.'' |url=http://www.jcca-online.org/Client/cca/JCCA.nsf/objects/JCCA_March_2008_52_1/$file/jcca-v52-1-007.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

Although [[vaccination]] is one of the most cost-effective forms of prevention against infectious disease, it remains [[Vaccine controversy|controversial]] within the chiropractic community.<ref name=Busse/> Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects,<ref name=Busse/> claiming that it is hazardous or ineffective.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Vaccine |date=2001 |volume=20 |issue= Suppl 1 |pages=S89–93 |title= Rise in popularity of complementary and alternative medicine: reasons and consequences for vaccination |author= Ernst E |doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(01)00290-0 |pmid=11587822}}</ref> Evidence-based chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but a minority of the profession rejects it, as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that diseases cannot be affected by vaccines.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2000 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=e43 |title= Chiropractors and vaccination: a historical perspective |author= Campbell JB, Busse JW, Injeyan HS |pmid=10742364 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/4/e43}}</ref> The [[American Chiropractic Association]] and the International Chiropractic Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease.<ref name=Campbell/> The Canadian Chiropractic Association supports vaccination; surveys in Canada in 2000 and 2002 found that 40% of chiropractors supported vaccination, and that over a quarter opposed it and advised patients against vaccinating themselves or their children.<ref name=Busse>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |date=2005 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=367–73 |title= Chiropractic antivaccination arguments |author= Busse JW, Morgan L, Campbell JB |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2005.04.011 |pmid=15965414 |url=http://jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(05)00111-9/fulltext?articleId=S0899-3467%2807%2960081-0}}</ref>
