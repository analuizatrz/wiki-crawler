'''Saint Maximus the Confessor''' (c. 580 - August 13, 662) was a [[Christian]] [[monk]], [[theologian]], and [[scholar]].  In addition, he was a civil servant in his early life, as the personal secretary to the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]].<ref>"Maximos, St., Confessor" in the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', ed. F.L. Cross (London: Oxford Press, 1958).</ref>.  

Maximus was involved in the [[Christological]] controversy known as [[Monothelitism]], in which Maximus supported the [[Chalcedonian]] position that [[Jesus]] had both a human and a divine will.  Maximus (also known as '''Maximus the Theologian''' and '''Maximus of Constantinople''') is venerated in both [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Western Christianity]].  His feast day is August 13 (or January 21).

==Life==
===Early Life===

Maximus was most likely born in Constantinople - although a biography written by his [[Maronite]] opponents has him born in Palestine.<ref>George C. Berthold, "Maximus Confessor" in The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, ed. Everett Ferguson (New York: Garland Publishing, 1997).</ref> Maximus' was born into [[Byzantine]] [[nobility]], as indicated by his position in the court of [[Heraclius]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10078b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] retrieved January 12, 2007: "This great man was of a noble family of Constantinople."</ref> For reasons unknown, Maximus left the public life in 630, and took [[monastic vows]] at a monastery in Chrysopolis, a city across the [[Bosporus]] from Constantinople (also known as [[Scutari]], the modern Turkish city of [[Üsküdar]]).  In his years in Chrysopolis, Maximus was elevated to the position of [[Abbot]] of the monastery.

When the [[Persian Empire]] conquered [[Anatolia]], Maximus was forced to flee to a monastery near [[Carthage]].  It was there that he came under the tutelage of [[Sophronius|Saint Sophronius]], and began studying the Christological writings of [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]].  It was also during his stay in Carthage that Maximus began his career as a theological and spiritual writer.

===Involvement in Monothelite controversy===
While Maximus was in Carthage, a controversy broke out regarding how to understand the interaction between the human and divine natures within the person of [[Jesus]]. This [[Christological]] debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the [[Council of Nicaea]] in 325, and were intensified following the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451. The [[Monothelite]] position was a developed as a compromise to appease those whose [[Christology]] was declared [[heresy]] at Chalcedon. The Monothelites adhered to the [[Chalcedonian]] definition of the [[hypostatic union]]: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ.  However, they went on to say that Christ had only a divine will and no human will (Monothelite is derived from the Greek for "one will").<ref>For more info, see [[Monothelite]]</ref>

[[Image:Hexagram-Constans II and Constantine IV-sb0995.jpg|thumb|300px|'''A coin showing Constans II with his son''' <br> Emperor Constans II supported [[Monothelitism]], and had Maximus exiled for his refusal to agree to Monothelite teachings.]]
The Monothelite position was promulgated by [[Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople]] and by Maximus' friend and successor as the Abbot of Chrysoplis, [[Patriarch Pyrrhus I of Constantinople|Pyrrus]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10078b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] retrieved January 15, 2007: "The first action of St. Maximus that we know of in this affair is a letter sent by him to Pyrrhus, then an abbot at Chrysopolis ..."</ref>  Following the death of Serius in 638, Pyrrhus succeeded him as Patriarch, but was shortly deposed due to political circumstances. During Pyrrus' exile from Constantinople, Maximus and the deposed Patriarch held a public debate on the issue of Monothelitism.  In the debate, which was held in the presence of many North African bishops, Maximus took the position that Jesus possessed both a human and a divine will. The result of the debate was that Pyrrus admitted the error of the Monothelite position, and Maximus accompanied him to [[Rome]] so that Pyrrus could submit to [[Pope Severinus]] in 645.<ref>Phillip Schaff, ''History of the Christian Church'', Volume IV: Mediaeval Christianity. A.D. 590-1073 (online edition)[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc4.i.xi.vi.html §111], accessed January 15, 2007</ref>  However, on the death on Emperor Heraclius and the ascension of Emperor [[Constans II]], Pyrrus returned to Constantinople and recanted of his acceptance of the [[Dyothelite]] ("two wills") position.

Maximus may have remained in Rome, because he was present when the newly elected [[Pope Martin I]] convened a gathering of bishops at the Lateran Bascillica in Rome in 649.<ref>"Maximus the Confessor", in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Church History'', ed. Jerald Brauer (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1971).  This is generally known as the First of Second [[Lateran Synod]], and is not recognized as an [[Ecumenical Council]].</ref>  The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may have been written by Maximus.<ref>For example, Gerald Berthold, "Maximus Confessor" in ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', (New York:Garland, 1997)</ref>  It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from [[Constans II]], who supported the Monothelite doctrine.  Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.<ref>David Hughes Farmer, ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Saints'' (Oxford:Oxford University Press, 1987) p.288.  This made Martin the last Bishop of Rome to be venerated as a martyr.</ref>

===Trial and Exile===
Maximus' refusal to accept [[Monothelitism]] caused him to brought to the Imperial capital of [[Constantinople]] to be tried as a [[heretic]] in 658. In Constantinople, the Monothelite position had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dythelite position, and was sent back into exile for four more years.

In 662, Maximus was placed on trial once more, and was once more convicted of [[heresy]].  Following the trial Maximus was [[tortured]], having his tongue cut out and his right hand cut off.<ref> Gerald Berthold, "Maximus Confessor" in ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', (New York:Garland, 1997)</ref>  Maximus was then exiled to the [[Lazica]] or [[Colchis]] region of [[Georgia (country)|Russian Georgia]] - perhaps the city of Batum - where he died in exile of natural causes on 13 August, 662.<ref>For example, see [[http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/saintm96.htm Catholic Forum]].</ref>  The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]].

==Legacy==
Along with [[Pope Martin I]], Maximus was vindicated by the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (the Sixth [[Ecumenical Council]], 680-681), which declared that [[Christ]] possed both a human and a divine will.  With this declaration, [[Monothelitism]] became heresy, and Maximus was posthumously declared innocent of all charges against him.

Maximus' work on [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius ]] was continued by [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]]. Other than this work by Scotus, Maximus was largely overlooked by Western theologians until recent years.<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of the Saints'' (David Hugh Farmer), which does not have an entry for Maximus, is an excellent example of how the West overlooked Maximus for years.  The ''Systematic Theology'' of Robert Jenson, written in the late 1990s, is an example of how Western theologians are rediscovering Maximus.  See also "Maximus the Confessor" in Michael O'Carroll, ''Trinitas: A Theological Encyclopedia of the Holy Trinity'' (Delaware:Michael Glazier, Inc, 1987); O'Carroll names Hans Urs von Balthasar as a "pioneer" in the Western rediscovery of Maximus</ref>

It is another story in the East, where Maximus has always been influential. The Eastern theologians [[Simeon the New Theologian]] and by [[Gregory Palamas]] are seen as intellectual heirs to Maximus. Further, a number of Maximus' works are included in the Greek [[Philokalia]] - a collection of some of the most influential Greek Christian writers.
