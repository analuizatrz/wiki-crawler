In the [[U.S. State]] of [[Nevada]], [[Interstate 15]] begins in [[Primm, Nevada|Primm]], continues through [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and it crosses the border with Arizona in [[Mesquite, Nevada|Mesquite]]. The freeway runs entirely in [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]]. Many motorists use Interstate 15 to visit Las Vegas, as it is the only primary Interstate highway in the city.

==Route description==
[[Image:Primm NV 24-08-01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interstate 15 traverses through Primm at Exit 1 near the [[California]]-[[Nevada]] state line.]]
Motorists in [[California]] leave the mountainous [[Mohave Desert]] and begin a long descent through [[Ivanpah Valley]] and [[Ivanpah Dry Lake]].  Interstate 15 crosses the [[Nevada]] state line at the first exit, [[Primm, Nevada|Primm]].

[[Image:I15LasVegas.jpg|thumb|200px|I-15 north near junction [[SR 146 (NV)|SR 146]], with the south end of [[Las Vegas Strip|The Strip]] visible in the background.  This sign, while located within the [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas urban limits]], actually indicates the distance to [[downtown Las Vegas]].]]
Once Interstate 15 leaves Primm, the route travels north through the desert with few services. The highway then enters the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] urban area upon passing the [[Nevada State Route 146|State Route 146]] (Saint Rose Parkway) interchange.  Quickly thereafter, the interstate meets [[Interstate 215 (Nevada)|Interstate 215]], or the Southern Beltway Interchange, which provides access to [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]] and [[McCarran International Airport]].  Originally, this interchange was called ''Son of Spaghetti Bowl'' by the Las Vegas Review-Journal when the interchange was built.

Interstate 15 travels along the west side of the [[Las Vegas Strip]] corridor and just west of downtown Las Vegas just before its junction with [[Interstate 515 (Nevada)|Interstate 515]] and [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]] (the "Spaghetti Bowl" interchage). Then the interstate enters [[North Las Vegas, Nevada|North Las Vegas]] and continues to run roughly parallel to [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] (old [[U.S. Route 91 (Nevada)|US 91]]) as it leaves the Las Vegas urban limits near the northern junction with the [[Interstate 215 (Nevada)|Clark County 215]] beltway.

Once Interstate 15 leaves [[North Las Vegas]], the freeway travels northeast and crosses the [[Muddy River]] at [[Glendale, Nevada|Glendale]] and then climbs up onto the Mormon Mesa. At [[Mesquite, Nevada|Mesquite]], the freeway then crosses the [[Arizona]] state line and cuts through the extreme northwestern corner of Arizona through the [[Virgin River Gorge]] before entering [[Utah]].

Between Las Vegas and the Nevada state line, the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] added [[callbox]]es at one-mile (1.6 km) intervals in the mid-2000s, used for motorists who end up with vehicle problems and don't have access to a cell phone.

Control cities for I-15 are [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] followed by [[Salt Lake City]] (north of the I-515/US-93/US-95 Interchange) heading northbound.  For southbound traffic, the control cities entering Nevada are Las Vegas and [[Los Angeles]] (the highway does not travel directly into Los Angeles; however, it is a major highway to the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area and San Diego).
