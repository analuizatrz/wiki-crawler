''[[Crohn's disease]]'' (also known as ''regional [[enteritis]]'') is a [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]], episodic, [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[inflammatory bowel disease|bowel disease]] (IBD) that affects the entire wall of the [[bowel]] or [[intestine]]s. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] from [[mouth]] to [[anus]]; as a result, the symptoms of Crohn's disease vary among afflicted individuals. The disease is characterized by areas of inflammation with areas of normal lining between in a symptom known as skip [[lesions]]. The main gastrointestinal symptoms are [[abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]] (which may be bloody or the blood may not be seen by the naked eye), [[constipation]], [[vomiting]], [[weight loss]] or [[weight gain]].  Crohn's disease can also cause complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract such as [[skin rashes]], [[arthritis]], and [[Uveitis|inflammation of the eye]].<ref name=Hanauer>{{cite journal | last = Hanauer | first = Stephen B. | year = 1996 | month = March | title = Inflammatory bowel disease | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 334 | issue = 13 | pages = 841-848 | id = PMID 8596552 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/334/13/841 | accessdate = 2006-11-10}}</ref>

The disease was independently described in 1904 by Polish surgeon [[Antoni Lesniowski]] and in 1932 by American [[gastroenterology|gastroenterologist]] [[Burrill Bernard Crohn]], for whom the disease was named.  Crohn, along with two colleagues, described a series of patients with inflammation of the [[terminal ileum]], the area most commonly affected by the illness.<ref name=CrohnBB>Crohn BB, Ginzburg L, Oppenheimer GD.

Although the cause of Crohn's disease is not known, it is believed to be an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disease]] that is [[genetics|genetically]] linked. The highest relative risk occurs in siblings, affecting males and females equally. Smokers are three times more likely to get Crohn's disease.

==Classification==
[[Image:Distribution of CD.svg|right|thumb|250px|Distribution of gastrointestinal Crohn's disease.  Based on data from [[American Gastroenterological Association]].]]
Crohn's disease almost invariably affects the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, most gastroenterologists classify the disease by the affected areas. ''Ileocolic Crohn's disease'', which affects both the [[ileum]] (the last part of the [[small intestine]] that connects to the [[large intestine]]) and the large intestine, accounts for fifty percent of cases. ''Crohn's ileitis'', affecting the ileum only, accounts for thirty percent of cases, and ''Crohn's colitis'', affecting the large intestine, accounts for the remaining twenty percent of cases, and may be particularly difficult to distinguish from ulcerative colitis. The disease can attack any part of the digestive tract, from [[mouth]] to [[anus]]. However, individuals affected by the disease rarely fall outside these three classifications, being affected in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the [[stomach]] and [[esophagus]].<ref name=Hanauer/>
Crohn's disease may also be classified by the behaviour of disease as it progresses. This was formalized in the Vienna classification of Crohn's disease.<ref name=Vienna>{{cite journal | author = Gasche C, Scholmerich J, Brynskov J, D'Haens G, Hanauer S, Irvine E, Jewell D, Rachmilewitz D, Sachar D, Sandborn W, Sutherland L | title = A simple classification of Crohn's disease: report of the Working Party for the World Congresses of Gastroenterology, Vienna 1998 | journal = Inflamm Bowel Dis | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 8-15 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10701144}}</ref>  There are three categories of disease presentation in Crohn's disease: stricturing, penetrating, and inflammatory. ''Stricturing disease'' causes narrowing of the bowel which may lead to [[bowel obstruction]] or changes in the caliber of the [[feces]]. ''Penetrating disease'' creates abnormal passageways ([[fistula]]e) between the bowel and other structures such as the skin. ''Inflammatory disease'' (or non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease) causes inflammation without causing strictures or fistulae.<ref name=Vienna/><ref name=phenotypes>{{cite journal | author = Dubinsky MC, Fleshner PP. | title = Treatment of Crohn's Disease of Inflammatory, Stenotic, and Fistulizing Phenotypes. | journal = Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 183-200 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12744819}}</ref>

==Symptoms==

[[Image:CD serpiginous ulcer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Endoscopy image of [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] showing [[serpiginous]] ulcer, a classic finding in Crohn's disease]]
Many people with Crohn's disease have symptoms for years prior to the diagnosis.<ref name=Pimentel>{{cite journal | last = Pimentel | first = Mark | coauthors = Michael Chang, Evelyn J.

People with Crohn's disease will go through periods of flare-ups and [[remission]].  

; Gastrointestinal symptoms
[[Abdominal pain]] may be the initial symptom of Crohn's disease. The pain is commonly [[cramp|cramp-like]] and may be relieved by [[defecate|defecation]]. It is often accompanied by [[diarrhea]], which may or may not be bloody, though diarrhea is not uncommon especially in those who have had surgery.  People who have had surgery or multiple surgeries often end up with [[short bowel syndrome]] of the gastrointestinal tract. The nature of the diarrhea in Crohn's disease depends on the part of the small intestine or colon that is involved. Ileitis typically results in large-volume watery feces. Colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of higher frequency. Fecal consistency may range from solid to watery. In severe cases, an individual may have more than 20 [[bowel movements]] per day and may need to awaken at night to defecate.<ref name=Hanauer/><ref name=emed/><ref name=Podolsky/><ref>{{cite journal | last = Mueller | first = M.

In the setting of severe Crohn's colitis, bleeding may be copious.<ref name=emed/> [[Flatus]] and bloating may also add to the intestinal discomfort.<ref name=emed/> 

Symptoms caused by intestinal [[stenosis]] are also common in Crohn's disease. Abdominal pain is often most severe in areas of the bowel with stenoses. In the setting of severe stenosis, [[vomiting]] and [[nausea]] may indicate the beginnings of small [[bowel obstruction]].<ref name=emed>{{cite web|first= Latha|last= Gopal|coauthors=Senthil Nachimuthu|publisher=eMedicine|title=Crohn Disease|url=http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic477.htm|accessdate=2006-07-02|date=2006-05-23}}</ref> Crohn's disease may also be associated with [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], a type of inflammation of the bile ducts.

Perianal discomfort may also be prominent in Crohn's disease. Itchiness or pain around the [[anus]] may be suggestive of inflammation, [[fistula|fistulization]] or [[abscess]] around the anal area<ref name=Hanauer/> or [[anal fissure]]. Perianal skin [[acrochordon|tags]] are also common in Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Taylor B, Williams G, Hughes L, Rhodes J | title = The histology of anal skin tags in Crohn's disease: an aid to confirmation of the diagnosis | journal = Int J Colorectal Dis | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 197-9 | year = 1989 | id = PMID 2769004}}</ref> [[Fecal incontinence]] may accompany peri-anal Crohn's disease. At the opposite end of the gastrointestinal tract, the mouth may be affected by non-healing sores ([[aphthous ulcer]]s). Rarely, the [[esophagus]], and [[stomach]] may be involved in Crohn's disease. These can cause symptoms including  difficulty swallowing ([[odynophagia]]), upper abdominal pain, and vomiting.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fix | first = Oren K. | coauthors = Jorge A.

;Systemic symptoms
Crohn's disease, like many other chronic, inflammatory diseases, can cause a variety of [[B symptoms|systemic symptoms]].<ref name=Hanauer/> Among children, [[growth failure]] is common. Many children are first diagnosed with Crohn's disease based on [[failure to thrive|inability to maintain growth]].<ref name=Beattie/>  As Crohn's disease may manifest at the time of the growth spurt in [[puberty]], up to 30% of children with Crohn's disease may have retardation of growth.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Büller | first = H.A. | year = 1997 | month = February | title = Problems in diagnosis of IBD in children | journal = The Netherlands Journal of Medicine  | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = S8-S11 | doi =10.1016/S0300-2977(96)00064-2 | id = PMID 9050326 }}</ref> Fever may also be present, though fevers greater than 38.5&nbsp;[[Celsius|˚C]] (101.3&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|˚F]]) are uncommon unless there is a complication such as an [[abscess]]<ref name=Hanauer/> Among older individuals, Crohn's disease may manifest as weight loss.

;Extraintestinal symptoms
[[Image:Crohnie sores 4.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Erythema nodosum.]]
In addition to systemic and gastrointestinal involvement, Crohn's disease can affect many other organ systems.<ref name=Danese>{{cite journal | last = Danese | first = Silvio  | coauthors = Stefano Semeraro, Alfredo Papa, Italia Roberto, Franco Scaldaferri, Giuseppe Fedeli, Giovanni Gasbarrini, Antonio Gasbarrini | year = 2005 | month = December | title = Extraintestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 11 | issue = 46 | pages = 7227-7236 | id = PMID 16437620 | url = http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/11/7227.asp | accessdate = 2006-07-02 }}</ref> Inflammation of the interior portion of the eye, known as [[uveitis]], can cause eye pain, especially when exposed to light ([[photophobia]]). Inflammation may also involve the white part of the eye ([[sclera]]), a condition called [[Scleritis|episcleritis]]. Both episcleritis and uveitis can lead to loss of vision if untreated.

Crohn's disease is associated with a type of [[Rheumatology|rheumatologic disease]] known as [[spondyloarthropathy|seronegative spondyloarthropathy]]. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more [[joint]]s ([[arthritis]]) or muscle insertions ([[enthesitis]]). The arthritis can affect larger joints such as the knee or shoulder or may exclusively involve the small joints of the hand and feet. The arthritis may also involve the spine, leading to [[ankylosing spondylitis]] if the entire spine is involved or simply [[sacroiliitis]] if only the lower spine is involved. The symptoms of arthritis include painful, warm, swollen, stiff [[Arthralgia|joints]] and loss of joint mobility or function.

Crohn's disease may also involve the skin, blood, and [[endocrine system]]. One type of skin manifestation, [[erythema nodosum]], presents as red nodules usually appearing on the shins. Erythema nodosum is due to inflammation of the underlying subcutaneous tissue and is characterized by septal [[panniculitis]]. Another skin lesion, [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], is typically a painful ulcerating nodule. Crohn's disease also increases the risk of blood clots; painful swelling of the lower legs can be a sign of [[deep venous thrombosis]], while difficulty breathing may be a result of [[pulmonary embolism]]. [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]], a condition in which the immune system attacks the [[red blood cells]], is also more common in Crohn's disease and may cause fatigue, pallor, and other symptoms common in [[anemia]]. [[Clubbing]], a deformity of the ends of the fingers, may also be a result of Crohn's disease. Finally, Crohn's disease may cause [[osteoporosis]], or thinning of the bones. Individuals with osteoporosis are at increased risk of [[bone fracture]]s.<ref name=Bernstein>{{cite journal | last = Bernstein | first = Michael | coauthors = Sue Irwin and Gordon R.

Crohn's disease can also cause neurological complications (reportedly in up to 15% of patients).<ref name="pro">[http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/inflammatory_crohn.html Crohn's disease]. professionals.epilepsy.com. Retrieved on [[July 13]], [[2007]].</ref> The most common of these are seizures, stroke, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, headache and depression.<ref name="pro"/>

Crohn's patients often also have issues with [[Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome]], which has similar symptoms. {{Fact|date=January 2008}}

;Complications
[[Image:Colorectal cancer endo 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Colonoscopy|Endoscopic]] image of '''colon cancer''' identified in the sigmoid [[colon (anatomy)]] on screening [[colonoscopy]] for Crohn's disease.]]  
Crohn's disease can lead to several mechanical complications within the intestines, including obstruction, fistulae, and abscesses. Obstruction typically occurs from strictures or adhesions which narrow the lumen, blocking the passage of the intestinal contents. Fistulae can develop between two loops of bowel, between the bowel and bladder, between the bowel and vagina, and between the bowel and skin. Abscesses are walled off collections of [[infection]], which can occur in the [[abdomen]] or in the [[wiktionary:perianal|perianal]] area in Crohn's disease sufferers.

Crohn's disease also increases the risk of cancer in the area of inflammation. For example, individuals with Crohn's disease involving the [[small bowel]] are at higher risk for [[small intestinal cancer]]. Similarly, people with Crohn's colitis have a [[relative risk]] of 5.6 for developing [[colon cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ekbom A, Helmick C, Zack M, Adami H |title=Increased risk of large-bowel cancer in Crohn's disease with colonic involvement |journal=Lancet |volume=336 |issue=8711 |pages=357-9 |year=1990 |pmid=1975343}}</ref> Screening for colon cancer with [[colonoscopy]] is recommended for anyone who has had Crohn's colitis for eight years, or more.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Collins P, Mpofu C, Watson A, Rhodes J | title = Strategies for detecting colon cancer and/or dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = | pages = CD000279 | year = | id = PMID 16625534}}</ref>

Individuals with Crohn's disease are at risk of [[malnutrition]] for many reasons, including decreased food intake and [[malabsorption]]. The risk increases following resection of the [[small bowel]]. Such individuals may require oral supplements to increase their caloric intake, or in severe cases, [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN). Most people with moderate or severe Crohn's disease are referred to a [[dietitian]] for assistance in nutrition.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Evans J, Steinhart A, Cohen Z, McLeod R | title = Home total parenteral nutrition: an alternative to early surgery for complicated inflammatory bowel disease | journal = J Gastrointest Surg | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 562–6 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12763417}}</ref>

There are many complications that can come with Crohn's disease like: obstructions, abscesses, free perforation, and hemorrhage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livingwithcrohnsdisease.com/livingwithcrohnsdisease/crohns_disease/complications_of_crohns.html|title=Complications of Crohn's Disease|accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>

Women with Inflammatory bowel disease shows that they "face a higher risk of adverse outcomes related to pregnancy, according to a report in the October issue of Gastroenterology" [http://www.ccfa.org/reuters/pregnancyoutcomes].

==Cause==

[[Image:NOD2 CARD15.svg|right|thumb|200px|Schematic of NOD2 CARD15 gene, which is associated with certain disease patterns in Crohn's disease]]

The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, genetic and environmental factors have been invoked in the [[pathogenesis]] of the disease. Research has indicated that Crohn's disease has a strong genetic link. <ref>[http://www.ccfa.org/reuters/genelic link Crohn's disease has strong genetic link: study]</ref> The disease runs in families and those with a sibling with the disease are 30 times more likely to develop it than the normal population. Ethnic background is also a risk factor. Until very recently, whites and European Jews accounted for the vast majority of the cases in the United States, and in most industrialized countries, this demographic is still true.  

[[Mutation]]s in the [[CARD15]] gene (also known as the NOD2 [[gene]]) are associated with Crohn's disease<!-- --><ref>Ogura Y, Bonen DK, Inohara N, ''et al.''  A frameshift mutation in NOD2 associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease.

A handful of cases of Crohn's Disease cases were reported at the turn of the 20th century, but since then, the disease has continued to increase in prevalence dramatically. Some argue that this increase has been the result of a genetic shift in the population caused by conditions favoring individuals carrying the genes linked with the disease. These conditions could be a lower infant mortality rate or better health care in the nations that have the highest incidence of disease (industrialized nations).   

Others argue that Crohn's Disease is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Many environmental factors have also been hypothesized as causes or risk factors for Crohn's disease. Proven environmental risk factors include living in an industrialized country, smoking, and living in an urban area. Diets high in sweet, [[fat]]ty or [[Food processing|refined foods]] may also play a role. A retrospective Japanese study found that those diagnosed with Crohn's disease had higher intakes of sugar, fat, fish and shellfish than controls prior to diagnosis.<!-- 
--><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sakamoto N, Kono S, Wakai K, ''et al.'' | title = Dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter case-control study in Japan. | journal = Inflamm Bowel Dis | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 154-63 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15677909}}</ref> A similar study in Israel also found higher intakes of fats (especially chemically modified fats) and [[sucrose]], with lower intakes of [[fructose]] and fruits, water, [[potassium]], [[magnesium]] and vitamin C in the diets of Crohn's disease sufferers before diagnosis,<!--

Certain chemicals in the diet, known as microparticles, are also hypothesized as a risk factor for the disease, as well as a poor imbalance of omega-6 to healthy omega-3 fatty acids that emerging research shows helps to improve all types of inflammatory disease. The most common forms of microparticles include titanium dioxide, aluminosilicates, anatase, calcium phosphate, and soil residue. These substances are ubiquitous in processed food and most toothpastes and lip glosses. Soil residue is found on fresh fruits and vegetables unless carefully removed. 

[[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]] has been shown to increase the risk of the return of active disease, or "flares".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cosnes J | title = Tobacco and IBD: relevance in the understanding of disease mechanisms and clinical practice. | journal = Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 481-96 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15157822}}</ref>
The introduction of [[hormonal contraception]] in the United States in the 1960's is linked with a dramatic increase in the incidence rate of Crohn's disease. Although a causal linkage has not been effectively shown, there remain fears that these drugs work on the digestive system in similar ways to smoking.<ref><!--

Additionally, many in the scientific community believe that early childhood exposure to illness is necessary to the creation of a proper immune system for those with the genetic suseptibility for Crohn's Disease. Like Polio, higher incidences of Crohn's Disease are associated with cleaner living conditions. Throughout the early and mid-20th century in the United States, the disease was strongly associated with upper-class populations, and today the disease does not yet exist in the many Third World countries, despite the fact that it occurs in all races. CD is also associated with first born and single children (because  they would have less exposure to childhood illness from siblings) and in populations that have low incidences of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is most often caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori that flourishes in cramped and unsanitary conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morris|first= Danielle L|coauthors=Scott M Montgomery|date=2000-11-18|title=Early environmental factors may have role in both Crohn's disease and gastric carcinoma - Letter to the Editor|journal=British Medical Journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0999/is_7271_321/ai_67708495/|accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref> 

Abnormalities in the immune system have often been invoked as being causes of Crohn's disease. It has been hypothesized that Crohn's disease involves augmentation of the [[T helper cell#Th1.2FTh2 Model for helper T cells|T<sub>h</sub>1]] of [[cytokine]] response in inflammation.<ref>Cobrin GM, Abreu MT.

A variety of pathogenic bacteria were initially suspected of being causative agents of Crohn's disease.  However, the current consensus is that a variety of microorganisms are simply taking advantage of their host's weakened mucosal layer and inability to clear bacteria from the intestinal walls, both symptoms of the disease.  <ref><!--

==Pathophysiology==

[[Image:Crohn's transmural path.jpg|thumb|right|120px|H and E section of [[colectomy]] showing transmural inflammation.]]

At the time of [[colonoscopy]], [[Biopsy|biopsies]] of the colon are often taken in order to confirm the diagnosis.  There are certain characteristic features of the [[pathology]] seen that point toward Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease shows a transmural pattern of [[inflammation]], meaning that the inflammation may span the entire depth of the intestinal wall.<ref name=Hanauer/> Grossly, [[ulcer]]ation is an outcome seen in highly active disease.  There is usually an abrupt transition between unaffected tissue and the ulcer. Under a microscope, biopsies of the affected colon may show [[mucosa]]l inflammation. Transmural inflammation results in formation of [[lymphoid aggregate]]s throughout the wall of the colon. This inflammation is characterized by focal infiltration of [[neutrophils]], a type of inflammatory cell, into the [[epithelium]]. This typically occurs in the area overlying [[lymphoid tissue|lymphoid]] aggregates. These neutrophils, along with [[lymphocyte|mononuclear cells]], may infiltrate into the [[Crypts of Lieberkuhn|crypts]] leading to inflammation (crypititis) or abscess (crypt abscess).  [[Granuloma]]s, aggregates of [[macrophage]] derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn's disease. The granulomas of Crohn's disease do not show "caseation", a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination that is characteristic of granulomas associated with infections such as [[tuberculosis]]. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal [[villus|villi]], atypical branching of the crypts, and change in the tissue type ([[metaplasia]]). One example of such metaplasia, ''Paneth cell metaplasia'', involves development of Paneth cells (typically found in the small intestine) in other parts of the gastrointestinal system.<ref name=Robbins>Crawford JM.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of Crohn's disease can sometimes be challenging,<ref name=Pimentel/> and a number of tests are often required to assist the physician in making the diagnosis.<ref name=emed/>  Sometimes even with all the tests the Crohn's does not show itself.  A colonoscopy has about a 70% chance of showing the disease and the rest of the tests go down in percentage.  Disease in the small bowel can not be seen through some of the regular tests; for example, a colonoscopy can't get there.

;Endoscopy
A [[colonoscopy]] is the best test for making the diagnosis of Crohn's disease as it allows direct visualization of the colon and the [[terminal ileum]], identifying the pattern of disease involvement. Occasionally, the colonoscope can travel past the terminal ileum but it varies from patient to patient. During the procedure, the [[gastroenterologist]] can also perform a [[biopsy]], taking small samples of tissue for laboratory analysis which may help confirm a diagnosis.  As 30% of Crohn's disease involves only the ileum,<ref name=Hanauer/> [[cannula]]tion of the terminal ileum is required in making the diagnosis. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum but not the [[rectum]], is suggestive of Crohn's disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata.<!--

[[Wireless capsule endoscopy]] is a technique where a small capsule with a built-in camera is swallowed, the camera takes serial pictures of the entire gastrointestinal tract and is passed in the patient's faeces.

;Radiologic tests
A [[barium follow-through|small bowel follow-through]] may suggest the diagnosis of Crohn's disease and is useful when the disease involves only the small intestine. Because colonoscopy and [[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscopy]] allow direct visualization of only the terminal ileum and beginning of the [[duodenum]], they cannot be used to evaluate the remainder of the small intestine. As a result, a [[barium follow-through]] x-ray, wherein [[barium sulfate]] suspension is ingested and [[fluoroscopy|fluoroscopic]] images of the bowel are taken over time, is useful for looking for inflammation and narrowing of the small bowel.<!--

===Comparison with ulcerative colitis===
The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of Crohn's disease is [[ulcerative colitis]], as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as '''indeterminate colitis'''.<ref name=Podolsky/><ref name=Hanauer/><ref name=emed/>

==Treatment==

{{main|Treatment of Crohn's disease|Biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease}}
Treatment is only needed for people exhibiting symptoms. The therapeutic approach to Crohn's disease is sequential: to treat [[acute (medical)|acute]] disease and then to maintain [[remission]]. Treatment initially involves the use of medications to treat any infection and to reduce inflammation. This usually involves the use of aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids, and may include antibiotics.  

Once remission is induced, the goal of treatment becomes maintaining remission and avoiding flares. Because of side-effects, the prolonged use of corticosteroids must be avoided. Although some people are able to maintain remission with aminosalicylates alone, many require immunosuppressive drugs.<ref name="HanauerCrohns"/>

On 14 January 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved [[natalizumab]] (Tysabri) for both induction of remission and maintenance of remission in Crohns. Natalizumab is humanised monoclonal antibody (MAb), and the first alpha-4 antagonist in a new class of agents called selective adhesion-molecule (SAM) inhibitors. Alpha-4 integrin is required for leukocytes to adhere to the walls of blood vessels and migrate into the gut; natalizumab prevents leukocytes from doing that. Natalizumab was previously approved for multiple sclerosis. However, because it suppresses the immune system, natalizumab has been linked to a very rare adverse effect that is usually fatal if undetected. Leukocytes also protect the body from viruses, and 2 patients on natalizumab, who were also receiving other immuno-suppressive drugs ([[Avonex]] and [[Immuran]]), died of a rare brain infection, [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]]. Because of this danger, patients must be in a special monitoring program, and natalizumab is given as a mono-therapy.<ref name="FDA-Tysbari">{{cite press release|title=FDA Approves Tysabri to Treat Moderate-to-Severe Crohn's Disease|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=2008-01-14|url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01775.html|accessdate=2008-01-16

[[Surgery]] may be required for complications such as obstructions, fistulas and/or abscesses, or if the disease does not respond to drugs within a reasonable time. For patients with an obstruction due to a stricture, two options for treatment are strictureplasty and resection of that portion of bowel.  According to a retrospective review at the Cleveland Clinic, there is no [[statistical significance]] between strictureplasty alone versus strictureplasty and resection specifically in cases of duodenal involvement. In these cases, re-operation rates were 31% and 27%, respectively, indicating that strictureplasty is a safe and effective treatment for selected patients with duodenal involvement.<ref name="pmid8918424">{{cite journal | author = Ozuner G, Fazio VW, Lavery IC, Milsom JW, Strong SA | title = Reoperative rates for Crohn's disease following strictureplasty.

==Prognosis==

Crohn's disease is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] condition for which there is currently no cure. It is characterized by periods of improvement followed by episodes when symptoms flare up. With treatment, most people achieve a healthy height and weight, and the mortality rate for the disease is low. Crohn's disease is associated with an increased risk of small bowel and colorectal carcinoma.<ref name=Canavan>{{cite journal | last = Canavan | first = C. | coauthors = K. R. Abrams, J.

Crohn's cannot be cured by surgery, though surgery does happen with blockages, whether partial or a full blockage occurs.  After the first surgery, the Crohn's usually shows up at the site of the resection though it can appear in other locations.  After a resection, scar tissue builds up which causes strictures.  A stricture is when the intestines becomes too small to allow excrement to pass through easily which can lead to a blockage. After the first resection, another resection may be necessary within five years of the first surgery.  [http://ibdcrohns.about.com/od/surgeryprocedures/a/resectioncrohns.htm]

Many patients will have temporary stoma formations together with possible associated complications. [http://www.answers.com/topic/crohn-s-disease?cat=health]

==History==
Inflammatory bowel diseases were described by [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]] (1682-1771), by Polish surgeon Antoni Leśniowski in 1904 (leading to the use of the eponym "'''Leśniowski-Crohn disease'''" in [[Poland]]) and by [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician T. Kennedy Dalziel in 1913.<ref>Kirsner JB.  Historical aspects of inflammatory bowel disease.  ''J Clin Gastroenterol.'' 1988 Jun;10(3):286-97.  PMID 2980764</ref>

[[Burrill Bernard Crohn]], an American gastroenterologist at [[New York City]]'s [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], described fourteen cases in 1932, and submitted them to the [[American Medical Association]] under the rubric of "Terminal ileitis: A new clinical entity".  Later that year, he, along with colleagues Leon Ginzburg and Gordon Oppenheimer published the case series as "Regional ileitis: a pathologic and clinical entity".<ref name=CrohnBB/>
