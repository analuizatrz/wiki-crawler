The {{nihongo|'''Mitsubishi i'''|三菱・i|Mitsubishi i}} is a ''[[kei car]]'' from [[Japan]]ese  [[automaker]] [[Mitsubishi Motors]], first released in January 2006,<ref name="newconcept">[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/products/detail1407.html "New concept for the future of small: 'i'"], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[January 24]] [[2006]]</ref> twenty eight months after its debut at the 2003 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name="testcar">[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/about_us/technology/environment/e/i.html ""i" Concept Test Car"], Mitsubishi Motors website</ref> It is the first four door automobile since the 1960s to employ a "[[RMR layout|rear midship]]" setup with the engine behind the passengers, in an attempt to improve safety and interior space without enlarging the overall exterior.<ref name="newconcept"/><ref name="autozine">[http://www.autozine.org/html/Mitsubishi/i.html "Mitsubishi i"], Mark Wan, ''Autozine'', [[November 18]] [[2005]]</ref>

The innovative layout and styling of the '''i''' proved an immediate critical and commercial success, exceeding Mitsubishi's initial sales targets by 20 percent and winning thirteen awards in its first year.<ref name="facts07">[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/ir/share/pdf/e/fact_2007.pdf Facts & Figures 2007], p.39, Mitsubishi Motors website</ref><ref name="businessweek">[http://www.businessweek.com/autos/autobeat/archives/2006/11/mitsubishis_awa.html "Mitsubishi's award winning minicar"], Ian Rowley, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', [[November 14]] [[2006]]</ref> Although designed with the Japanese ''keijidōsha'' light automobile class in mind, the attention it generated led to its subsequent introduction in [[right hand drive]] markets in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]] and [[Europe]]. It is also speculated to be the basis of the  [[battery electric vehicle]] Mitsubishi has timetabled for introduction in 2010.<ref name="energyblog">[http://thefraserdomain.typepad.com/energy/2006/10/mitsubishi_i_mi.html "Mitsubishi i MiEV Single Motor EV"], James Fraser, The Energy Blog, [[October 12]] [[2006]]</ref><ref name="wcf">[http://www.worldcarfans.com/news.cfm/newsID/2060818.008/country/jcf/mitsubishi/mitsubishi-i-in-detail "Mitsubishi i: In Detail"], F. de Leeuw van Weenen, WorldCarFans.com, [[August 18]] [[2006]]</ref>

[[Image:2003 i concept.jpg|left|thumb|The 2003 Mitsubishi "i" Concept debuted the car's striking exterior.]]
Two [[concept car|prototypes]] were exhibited during the car's development. The first was the '''"i" Concept''', which debuted at the 60th [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in 2003, and previewed the car's striking exterior.<ref name="testcar"/> Motoring journalists were quick to seize on the distinctive [[silhouette]], calling it "a very good egg",<ref name="goodegg">[http://motoring.independent.co.uk/features/article1090796.ece "Mitsubishi 'i': All round, a very good egg"], Euan Sey, ''[[The Independent]]'', [[June 20]] [[2006]]</ref> and a "crystal ball" with which to see the future of Mitsubishi.<ref name="redbook">[http://www.redbook.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story/D468D5BB21915C26CA2572100028B913?OpenDocument "Tokyo show: Mitsubishi's crystal ball concepts"], Byron Mathioudakis, redbook.goauto.com, [[21 October]] [[2003]]</ref> One reviewer even speculated it to be an allusion by the vehicle's [[France|French]]-born designer [[Olivier Boulay]] to the [[Renault 4CV]], France's popular [[post-war]] "people's car" with which the '''i''' shared its four seat, rear-engined layout.<ref name="redbook"/> Its styling was formally lauded when the '''i''' won the Grand Prize at the 50th anniversary Good Design Awards from the Japanese [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] in October 2006, the first ''kei'' car to win the award.<ref name="gmark">[http://www.g-mark.org/english/archive/2006/award-best15.html "Good Design Grand Prize 2006"], G-Mark.org</ref><ref name="gda06">[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1539.html "i" takes Good Design Grand Prize 2006], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[October 25]] [[2006]]</ref>

Explaining the choice of name, the company claimed that "i" could represent the owner (''I'', the [[English personal pronouns#List of English pronouns|nominative personal pronoun]]) as an encouragement to personal expression, or ''innovation'', ''intelligence'' and ''imagination'', keywords in the car's development.<ref name="name">[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1276.html "Mitsubishi Motors chooses 'Outlander' and 'i' as names for new SUV and kei minicar models"], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[May 23]] [[2005]]</ref><ref name="automotoportal">[http://www.automotoportal.com/article/mitsubishi-i-to-go-on-sale-in-the-uk "Mitsubishi “i” to go on sale in the UK"], Automotoportal, [[February 16]] [[2007]]</ref> It was also a [[word play|play]] on the Japanese word for love, [[Help:IPA pronunciation key|pronounced]] /ai/.<ref name="37th_motorshow">[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/motorshow/detail905.html "Mitsubishi Motors exhibits at 37 th Tokyo Motor Show"], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[October 15]] [[2003]]</ref><ref name="automobilemag">[http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/2003_fms_mitsui/ "Mitsubishi i Concept"], Automobilemag.com, [[January 12]] [[2004]]</ref>
<!-- FAIR USE of 2003 se-ro.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:2003 se-ro.jpg for rationale -->
[[Image:2003 se-ro.jpg|right|thumb|The 2003 Mitsubishi Se-Ro concept, which introduced the 660&nbsp;cc engine used in the production version of the i.]]

The "i" Concept was powered by a 999&nbsp;cc powerplant with the company's [[Mitsubishi Smart Idling]] (MSI) system, which turns off the engine automatically when the vehicle is stationary, and can restart it within 0.2&nbsp;seconds.<ref name="techreview_04-16">[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/about_us/technology/review/e/pdf/2004/16E.pdf Mitsubishi Motors Technical Review 2004 no.16, pp.29-50]</ref> So equipped, Mitsubishi claimed the car was capable of fulfilling the "three litre initiative" for [[gasoline]] [[reciprocating engine|engines]], meaning fuel consumption of no more than 3.0&nbsp;[[litre]]s per 100&nbsp;[[kilometre]]s (94.2&nbsp;[[fuel economy in automobiles|mpg]], 78.4&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;mpg).

The second prototype, called the '''Se-Ro''' and exhibited at the 2003 [[Tokyo Motor Show]], previewed the production model's more conventional mechanical underpinnings, despite having a more radical appearance which bore little resemblance to the final design.<ref name="cardesign_sero">[http://archive.cardesignnews.com/autoshows/2003/tokyo/preview/mitsubishi-sero/index.html "Mitsubish Sero concept for the Tokyo Motor Show"], Car Design News, [[October 16]] [[2003]]</ref> Instead, its polished aluminium body was styled to resemble a [[zeppelin]] or [[airship]].<ref name="4car_sero">[http://www.channel4.com/4car/ft/feature/concept+car/1577/1 "Concept Car: Mitsubishi SE-RO"], 4Car, [[November 13]] [[2003]]</ref><ref name="motortrend">[http://www.motortrend.com/future/concept_cars/112_0310_mitsubishi_se_ro "First Look: Mitsubishi Se-Ro"], Brandy A. Schaffels, ''[[Motor Trend]]''</ref> The [[aviation]] theme continued with the name; Se-Ro, short for "secret room", was a veiled reference to the [[Mitsubishi Zero]] [[fighter aircraft]] of [[World War II]].<ref name="AEplus">[http://www.ae-plus.com/Key%20topics/kt-design-news11.htm "Going Japanese"], Nargess Shahmanesh-Banks, ''Automotive Engineer PLUS''</ref>

==Technical details==
===Body and dimensions===
A lightweight aluminium [[space frame]] structure and a rear-engined layout allowed Mitsubishi to incorporate a larger front [[crumple zone]], in order to meet current safety legislation without compromising interior space.<ref name="newconcept"/> With no [[powertrain]] in front of the driver, the designers were able to shorten the front overhang and lengthen the [[wheelbase]] to 2550&nbsp;[[millimetre]]s (100.4&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]), giving greater legroom for passengers than many comparable ''kei'' cars whose wheelbase is typically 130–190&nbsp;millimetres (5.1–7.5&nbsp;in) less.<ref name="autozine"/> The downside of this design was a reduction in cargo-carrying capacity, which was necessarily compromised by the engine's location in the rear.<ref name="4car_driven">[http://www.channel4.com/4car/di/road+test/driving+impression/993/3 "Driven: Mitsubishi i"], Euan Sey, 4Car, [[April 26]], [[2006]]</ref><ref name="nihon_car_bike">[http://www.nihoncarandbike.com/news-280-X.html "Mitsubishi i"], G-A.G, Nihon Car and Bike, [[May 15]] [[2006]]</ref>
[[Image:Mitsubishi_i_2.jpg|thumb|right|The engine of the '''i''' as seen in cutaway, behind the rear seats and under the floor of the rear hatch storage area, just ahead of the rear axle.]]

===Drivetrain===
The '''i''' has a "rear-midship" engine mounted just ahead of the rear [[axle]], a highly unusual configuration in a small car where [[front-engine design]] has dominated since the 1970s.<ref name="autozine"/> The ''[[Mitsubishi 3B2 engine|3B20]]'' three cylinder powerplant has an [[aluminium]] [[cylinder block]], a [[engine displacement|displacement]] of 659&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre]]s, and incorporates [[double overhead camshaft]]s with ''[[MIVEC]]'' [[variable valve timing]] in the [[cylinder head]]. Initially only an [[intercooled]] and [[turbocharged]] engine was offered, until a [[naturally aspirated]] version was introduced for 2007.<ref name="06_1H_results">[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1542.html "Mitsubishi Motors Announces FY2006 First Half Financial Results and Forecasts for the Full Year"], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[October 30]] [[2006]]</ref><ref name="i_preformance">{{cite web | title = "Mitsubishi i performance" | publisher = Mitsubishi-motors.co.jp | date = [[February 26]] [[2007]] | language = Japanese | url = http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.jp/i/performance/index.html }}</ref> A four-speed [[automatic gearbox]] transmits power to the [[rear wheel drive|rear]] or [[four-wheel drive|all four]] wheels, depending on specification.

===Suspension, brakes and tires===
[[Image:Mitsubishi i 2.JPG|thumb|right|Two Mitsubishi i ''kei cars'' photographed together in Japan. The silver i is a dealer model for customers to test drive.]]
[[MacPherson strut]]s are used in the front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and an unusual three-link [[De Dion tube]]/[[Watt's linkage]] is used in the rear.<ref name="testcar"/> Front [[disc brake|discs]] with [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock braking]] (ABS) and [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] (EBD) are standard across the range.<ref name="specifications">{{cite web | title = "Mitsubishi i specifications" | publisher = Mitsubishi-motors.co.jp | date = [[February 26]] [[2007]] | language = Japanese | url = http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.jp/i/spec/index.html }}</ref> In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen&nbsp;inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts and wider 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of [[oversteer]] caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.<ref name="autozine"/>

===Specifications===
Three individual models, or grades, were available on the car's release in 2006; ''S'', ''M'', and ''G'', in ascending order of price. They all shared the same five-door [[hatchback]] body style and turbocharged engine, but offered differing levels of options and standard equipment. In 2007 the base ''S'' model was given the new naturally aspirated powerplant, and was positioned below the two new grades, ''L'' and ''LX'', whose engine it shared.<ref name="specifications"/>

==Special editions==
[[Image:Mitsubishi i-MiEV.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Battery electric vehicle|battery electric]] [[MIEV|Mitsubishi i MiEV]].]]
From [[July 25]]–[[July 31|31]], [[2006]] the company displayed a unique ''Mitsubishi i Hello Kitty edition'' at the [[Mitsukoshi]] department store in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Nihonbashi]] district. Based on the [[two-wheel drive]] ''G'' model, it had a pink [[paint scheme]] with co-ordinated interior, "Princess Kitty" [[decal]]s on the doors and windows, a ribbon decal on the roof, and themed [[headrest]]s with small, [[feline]] ears. The car, which was described as "the most quintessentially Japanese car...ever" for fusing two of the country's [[cultural icon]]s — [[Hello Kitty]] and ''keijidōsha'' — was eventually sold in a charity auction on behalf of [[UNICEF]].<ref name="kitty">[http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/07/the-ultimate-kei-mitsubishi-i-hello-kitty-princess-kitty-edit/ "The ultimate kei?

Mitsubishi has given the '''i''' a prominent role in the company's [[alternative propulsion]] research projects, developing a version using their ''[[MiEV]] (Mitsubishi innovative Electric Vehicle)'' technology in 2006 and exhibited at the 22nd International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium & Exposition in [[Yokohama]]. MMC provided three [[electric utility|power companies]] with vehicles in 2006 and 2007 in order to evaluate how a "[[Battery electric vehicle#Charging|fast-charge]]" [[infrastructure]] might be developed for electric vehicles. [[Fleet vehicle|Fleet]] testing by five power companies was conducted later in 2007,<ref name="miev">[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1533.html "Mitsubishi Motors builds new research EV, "i MiEV" for joint research with power companies"], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[October 11]] [[2006]]</ref> with a view to future public sales between 2008 and 2010.<ref name="energyblog"/><ref name="wcf"/><ref name="dreams">[http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId=101846&topicId=104970025&docId=l:676599368  "Plugging into electric dreams"], Kevin Hepwork, ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'', [[September 28]] [[2007]]</ref>
