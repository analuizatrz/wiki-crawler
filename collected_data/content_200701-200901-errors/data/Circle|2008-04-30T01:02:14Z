'''Circles''' are simple [[shape]]s of [[Euclidean geometry]]. A circle consists of those [[point (geometry)|points]] in a [[plane]] which are at a constant [[distance]], called the [[radius]], from a fixed point, called the ''center''.  Through any three points not on the same [[Line (mathematics)|line]], there passes one and only one circle.

A [[chord (geometry)|chord]] of a circle is a line segment whose both endpoints lie on the circle.  A [[diameter]] is a chord passing through the center. The length of a diameter is twice the radius. A diameter is the largest chord in a circle.

Circles are simple closed [[curve]]s which divide the plane into an interior and an exterior.  The ''[[circumference]]'' of a circle is the perimeter of the circle, and the interior of the circle is called a ''[[Disk (mathematics)|disk]]''.  An ''[[Arc (geometry)|arc]]'' is any [[Connected space|connected]] part of a circle.   

A circle is a special [[ellipse]] in which the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] are coincident.  Circles are [[conic section]]s attained when a [[conical surface|right circular cone]] is intersected with a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone.

==Properties==

*The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetry]])
*The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the center for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,'''R'''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.
*All circles are [[similarity (mathematics)|similar]].
**A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]], 
**The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]]. 
**The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2[[pi|π]] and π, respectively.
*The circle centered at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].
*Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle.  In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the center of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points.  See [[circumcircle]].

=== Chord properties ===
* Chords equidistant from the center of a circle are equal (length). 
* Equal (length) chords are equidistant from the center. 
* The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector: 
** A perpendicular line from the center of a circle bisects the chord. 
** The [[line segment]] ([[Circular segment]]) through the center bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord. 
* If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. 
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal. 
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplemental.
** For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.
* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle.
* The diameter is longest chord of the circle.

===Sagitta properties===
*  The sagitta is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the circumference of the circle.
*  Given the length ''y'' of a chord, and the length ''x'' of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle which will fit around the two lines:

:: <math>r=\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \frac{x}{2}.</math>

Another proof of this result which relies only on 2 chord properties given above is as follows.  Given a chord of length y and with sagitta of length x, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle.  Since the diameter is twice the radius, the "missing" part of the diameter is (2*r-x) in length.  Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (2*r-x)(x)=(y/2)^2.  Solving for r, we find:

:: <math>r=\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \frac{x}{2}.</math>

as required.

===Tangent properties===
*The line drawn perpendicular to the end point of a radius is a tangent to the circle. 
*A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent at the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle. 
*Tangents drawn from a point outside the circle are equal in length. 
*Two tangents can always be drawn from a point outside of the circle.

===Theorems===
[[Image:Secant-Secant Theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Secant-secant theorem]]
{{See also|Power of a point}}
*The chord theorem states that if two chords, CD and EB, intersect at A, then ''CA''&times;''DA'' = ''EA''&times;''BA''. (Chord theorem) 
*If a tangent from an external point ''D'' meets the circle at ''C'' and a secant from the external point ''D'' meets the circle at ''G'' and ''E'' respectively, then ''DC''<sup>2</sup> = ''DG''&times;''DE''. (tangent-secant theorem) 
*If two [[secant]]s, DG and DE, also cut the circle at H and F respectively, then ''DH''&times;''DG''=''DF''&times;''DE''. (Corollary of the tangent-secant theorem) 
*The angle between a tangent and chord is equal to the subtended angle on the opposite side of the chord. (Tangent chord property)
*If the angle subtended by the chord at the center is 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] then ''l'' = √2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''r'', where ''l'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.
*If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle A is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (DE and BC). This is the secant-secant theorem.

===Inscribed angles===

[[Image:inscribed angle theorem.svg|thumb|242px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]

An [[inscribed angle]] <math>\psi</math> is exactly half of the corresponding [[central angle]] <math>\theta</math> (see Figure).
Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc have the same value
(cf. the blue and green angles <math>\psi</math> in the Figure).  Angles inscribed on the arc are supplementary.
In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] 
is a [[right angle]].

==Apollonius circle==<!-- This section is linked from [[Sphere]] -->

[[Image:Apollonius circle definition labels.svg|thumb|200px|left|<math>\frac{d_1}{d_2}=\textrm{constant}</math> Apollonius' definition of a circle]]

[[Apollonius of Perga]] showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in plane having a constant ''ratio'' of distances to two fixed foci, A and B.  

The proof is as follows.  A line segment PC bisects the interior angle APB, since the segments are similar:

:<math>
\frac{AP}{BP} = \frac{AC}{BC}.
</math>

Analogously, a line segment PD bisects the corresponding exterior angle.  Since the interior and exterior angles sum to <math>180^{\circ}</math>, the angle CPD is exactly <math>90^{\circ}</math>, i.e., a [[right angle]].   The set of points P that form a right angle with a given line segment CD form a circle, of which CD is the diameter.

===Cross-ratios===
[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|225px|Early [[science]], particularly [[geometry]] and [[Astrology and astronomy|astronomy/astrology]], was connected to the divine for most [[History of science in the Middle Ages|medieval scholars]]. Notice, even, the circular shape of the [[halo]].
The [[compass (drafting)|compass]] in this [[13th century]] manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation (theology)|Creation]], as many believed that there was something intrinsically "divine" or "perfect" that could be found in circles]]

A closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [[cross-ratio]] of points in the [[complex plane]].  If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are as above, then the Apollonius circle for these three points is the collection of points ''P'' for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:
:<math>|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.</math>
Stated another way, ''P'' is a point on the Apollonius circle if and only if the cross-ratio [''A'',''B'';''C'',''P''] is on the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.
===Generalized circles===
{{See also|Generalized circle}}
If ''C'' is the [[midpoint]] of the segment ''AB'', then the collection of points ''P'' satisfying the Apollonius condition

:<math>\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \frac{|AC|}{|BC|}</math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)

is not a circle, but rather a line.

Thus, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points ''P'' satisfying (1) is called a '''generalized circle'''.  It may either be a true circle or a line.
