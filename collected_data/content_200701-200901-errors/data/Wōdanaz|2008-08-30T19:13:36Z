'''''{{lang|gem|*Wōđanaz}}''''' or '''''{{lang|gem|*Wōđinaz}}''''' is the reconstructed{{ref|asterisk}} [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] name of a god of [[Germanic paganism]],  known as '''''{{lang|non|[[Óðinn]]}}''''' in   [[Norse mythology]], '''''{{lang|ags|[[Wōden]]}}''''' in  [[Old English language|Old English]], '''''{{lang|goh|Wodan}}''''' or  '''''{{lang|goh|Wotan}}''''' in [[Old High German]] and '''''{{lang|lng|Godan}}''''' in [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]]. He is in all likelihood identical with the Germanic god identified as '''[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]''' by Roman writers and possibly with Tacitus' ''{{lang|la|[[regnator omnium deus]]}}''. 

Odin is sometimes thought to have risen to prominence during the [[Migration period]], some authors claim gradually displacing [[Tyr]] as the head of the pantheon in [[West Germanic languages|West]] and [[North Germanic languages|North]] Germanic cultures. However this would conflict time-wise with the association to Tacitus' mentioning of ''{{lang|la|regnator omnium deus}}'' as indeed meaning Wōdanaz, since that account occurred much earlier.

The theory of Odin displacing Tyr also lies on two separate foundations of identification which similarly conflict. Namely that the original prominence of Tyr (from Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem|*Tîwaz}}'') arises as a theory from the name being a cognate to the supreme deity of many other Indo-European faiths: [[Zeus]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]], [[Dyeus]]. However seeing as Wōdanaz has no etymological cognate in such faiths, Odin's position in relation to the overall Indo-European belief structure cannot be ascertained. No evidence exists to the effect that the deity Tyr ever had the degree of importance ascribed to him that Odin did in the regions where Odin/Wōdanaz was known.

Testimonies of the god are scattered over a wide range, both temporally and geographically. More than a millennium separates the earliest Roman accounts and archaeological evidence from the beginning of the [[Common Era]] from the Odin of the [[Edda]] and later medieval folklore.

Wōdanaz is associated with poetic or mantic qualities, his name being connected with the concept of ''{{lang|gem|*[[wōþuz]]}}'', "''{{lang|la|furor poeticus}}''" (poetic fury), and is thus the god of poets and seers. He is a shapechanger and healer, and thus a god of magicians and leeches. He is associated with the  [[Wild Hunt]] of dead, and thus a death deity. He is also a god of war and bringer of victory. 

The time periods distinguished in this article are
*[[Proto-Germanic]] period, ca. 2nd century BC to 2nd century AD:  ''{{lang|gem|*Wodanaz}}'' and "Germanic Mercury";
*[[Migration Period]], ca. 3rd to 7th centuries: {{lang|gem|''[[Woden]]'', ''Wodan''}} and [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] ''{{lang|gem|*Wodinaz}}''; the earliest records of the name ''Wodan'' date to the 6th century [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]];
*[[Viking Age]], ca. 8th to 12th centuries:  Scandinavian ''{{lang|non|[[Óðinn]]}}'';
*[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] to [[Early Modern]] periods, ca. 13th to 18th centuries: [[Germanic folklore]] ([[Wild Hunt]]);
*Modern period, ca. 1800 to present: [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[Viking revival]], [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Neopagan reconstructions]] and references in popular culture.

==Etymology==
{{see|Óðr|Vili and Vé}}
The attested forms of the theonym are traditionally derived from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem|*Wōđanaz}}''{{ref|devries}} (in Old Norse word-initial ''{{lang|gem|*w-}}'' was dropped before rounded vowels and so the name became ''{{lang|non|Óðinn}}''). [[Adam von Bremen]] etymologizes the god worshipped by the 11th-century Scandinavian pagans as ''"Wodan {{lang|la|id est furor}}"'' ("''Wodan'', which means 'fury'"). An obsolete alternative etymology, which has been adhered to by many early writers including [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] in his ''{{lang|la|[[Libri tres de occulta philosophia]]}}'', is to give it the same root as the word ''[[god]]'' itself, from its Proto-Germanic form ''*{{lang|gem|ǥuđ-}}''. This is not tenable today according to most modern academics, except for the Lombardic name ''{{lang|lng|Godan}}'', which may go back to ''{{lang|gem|*ǥuđanaz}}'' (see also ''[[goði]]'', ''[[gaut]]'', ''[[god]]'').

It should be noted at this point that [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] had two different words spelled ''{{lang|non|[[óðr]]}}'', one an adjective and the other a noun. The adjective means "mad, frantic, furious, violent",{{ref|cleasby}} and is cognate with Old English ''{{lang|ags|wōd}}''.{{ref|b&t}} The noun means "mind, wit, soul, sense" and "song, poetry",{{ref|cleasby2}} and is cognate with Old English ''{{lang|ags|wōþ}}''. In compounds, ''{{lang|non|óð-}}'' means "fiercely energetic" (e.g. ''{{lang|non|óð-málugr}}'' "speaking violently, excited"). 

Both Old Norse words are from Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem|*wōþuz}}''{{ref|b&t2}}, continuing [[Pre-Germanic]] ''{{PIE|*wātus}}''.{{ref|pok}} Two extra-Germanic cognates are the [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] ''{{lang|cel|*wātus}}'' "mantic poetry" (continued in Irish ''{{lang|ga|fáith}}'' "poet" and  [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''{{lang|cy|gwawd}}'' "praise-poetry") and the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[vates|vātes]]}}'' "prophet, seer" (a possible loan from Proto-Celtic ''{{lang|cel|*wātis}}'', [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] {{lang|xtg-Grek|ουατεις}}). A possible, but uncertain, cognate is [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|api-vat-}}'' "to excite, awaken" ([[Rigveda|RV]] 1.128.2). The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] meaning of the root is therefore reconstructed as relating to spiritual excitation. The Old Norse semantic split is reflected in Adam von Bremen's testimony of the synchronic understanding of the name as "fury", rather than "poetry" or similar.

Meid{{ref|meid}} suggested Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem|*-na-}}'' as a suffix expressing lordship ("{{lang|de|Herrschersuffix}}"), in view of words such as  Odin's name ''Herjann'' "lord of armies", ''[[drott|drótinn]]'' "lord of men", and ''þjóðann'' "lord of the nation", which would result in a direct translation of "lord of spiritual energy", "lord of poetry" or similar. It is sufficient, however, and more common, to assume a more general meaning of pertinence or possession for the suffix, inherited from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''{{lang|ine|*-no-}}'', to arrive at roughly the same meaning.

Rübekeil (2003:29){{ref|rk}} draws attention to the suffix variants ''{{lang|gem|*-ina-}}'' (in ''Óðinn'') vs. ''{{lang|gem|*-ana-}}'' (in ''Woden'', ''Wotan''). This variation, if considered at all, was dismissed as "suffix [[ablaut]]" by earlier scholars. There are, however, indications from outside Old Norse of a suffix ''{{lang|gem|*-ina-}}'': English ''Wednesday'' (rather than ''*Wodnesday'') via [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] goes back to ''{{lang|gem|*wōđina-}}''.  Rübekeil concludes that the original Proto-Germanic form of the name was ''{{lang|gem|*Wōđinaz}}'', yielding Old Norse ''Óðinn'' and unattested Anglo-Saxon ''*Wēden'', and that the attested West Germanic forms are early medieval "clerical" [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]], formed under the impression of synchronic association with terms for "fury".

The [[pre-Proto-Germanic]] form of the name would then be ''{{lang|ine|*Wātinos}}''. Rübekeil suggests that this is a loan from Proto-Celtic into pre-Proto-Germanic, referring to the god of the ''{{lang|ine|*wātis}}'', the Celtic priests of mantic prophecy, so that the original meaning of the name would be "he [the god/lord] of the Vates" (p. 33), which he tentatively identifies with [[Lugus]] (p. 40).

==Odin and Mercury==
Less is known about the role of Odin as receiver of the dead among the more southern [[Germanic tribes]]. The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] probably refers to Odin when he talks of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The reason is that, like Mercury, Odin was regarded as [[Psychopomp]]os, "the leader of souls". 

[[Julius Caesar]] calls Mercury the "deum maxime" of the Gauls in ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' 6.17.1.  

Paulus Diaconus (or [[Paul the Deacon]]), writing in the late 8th century, tells that Odin (''Guodan'') was the chief god of the [[Langobards]] and, like earlier southern sources, he identifies Odin with Mercury (''History of the Langobards'', I:9). Because of this identification, Paulus adds that the god Guodan, "although held to exist [by Germanic peoples], it was not around this time, but long ago, and not in Germania, but in Greece" where the god originated. [[Robert Wace]] also identifies Wotan with Mercury. [[Viktor Rydberg]], in his work on Teutonic Mythology, draws a number of other parallels between Odin and Mercury, such as the fact that they were both responsible for bringing poetry to mortals.

Similarly, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] most likely references Odin and [[Thor]] in his history of the later Roman Empire as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Mars (god)|Mars]], respectively, though a direct association is not made. This, however, underlines a particular problem concerning ancient Greek and Roman sources. Historians from both cultures, during all periods, believed the deities of foreign cultures to merely be their own gods under different names (see ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''). Such an example may be found in Herodotus' association of an Egyptian Ram-headed god (most probably [[Amun]]) with [[Zeus]]. Later, Medieval historians followed the older tradition and likewise made such associations. However, there is no historical evidence to suggest that these are valid connections and as such they should not be taken as historical fact.

==Celtic parallels==
Parallels between Odin and [[Lugus]] have often been pointed out: both are intellectual gods, commanding magic and poetry. Both have ravens and a spear as their attributes, and both are one-eyed. [[Julius Caesar]] (''de bello Gallico'', 6.17.1) mentions Mercury as the chief god of [[Celtic religion]]. However, most of our sources concerning Celtic Lugus are [[Insular Celtic]], while sources discussing Gaulish Lugus are rare, although his importance is manifest from the numerous toponyms containing the name (''[[Lugdunum]]'' etc.). [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucanus]] mentions three Celtic gods: [[Teutates]], [[Esus]], and [[Taranis]]. Teutates is identified with Mars or Mercury, and he receives as [[human sacrifice]]s drowned captives and fallen warriors. Esus is also identified with Mercury but also with Mars, and he accepts as human sacrifices prisoners who are hung on trees and then dismembered. Taranis is identified with Jupiter,<!-- where was this? --> as a warlord and a sky god. Human sacrifices to Taranis are made by burning prisoners in wooden casks. <!-- DUBIOUS: The Celtic priests administering the human sacrifices were the [[Vates]].--> Lugus is not mentioned by Lucanus at all. The suggestion of Rübekeil (2003:38), in view of his hypothesis of a Celtic origin of the Germanic god discussed above, is that Lugus refers to the trinity Teutates-Esus-Taranis considered as a single god. 

An etymological reflex of Celtic ''Lugus'' is possibly found in ''[[Loki]]'' (a Germanic god described as a "hypostasis of Odin" by Folke Ström). A likely context of the diffusion of elements of Celtic ritual into Germanic culture are tribes such as the [[Chatti]], who lived at the Celtic-Germanic boundary in [[Hesse]] during the final centuries BC. (The Chatti are traditionally considered a Germanic tribe, but many of their leaders and their settlements had Celtic names.) It must be remembered that Odin in his Proto-Germanic form was not the chief god, but that he only gradually replaced [[Tyr]] in this capacity during the [[migration period]].

== Shamanic traits ==

The goddess [[Freyja]] is described as an adept of the mysteries of [[seid]] ([[shamanism]]), a [[völva]], and it is said that it was she who initiated Odin into its mysteries. In ''[[Lokasenna]]'', [[Loki]] verbally abuses Odin for practising seid, condemning it as a unmanly art. A justification for this may be found in the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' where Snorri opines that in following the practice of seid, the practitioner was rendered [[ergi|unmanly]]. Another explanation is that its manipulative aspects ran counter to the male ideal of forthright, open behaviour.

Odin was a compulsive seeker of wisdom, consumed by his passion for knowledge, to the extent that he sacrificed one of his eyes (which one this was is unclear) to [[Mímir]], in exchange for a drink from the waters of wisdom in Mímir's well.

[[Image:Merseburger Zaubersprüche.jpg|thumb|Merseburger Zaubersprüche - Merseburger Domstiftsbibliothek, Codex 136, f. 85r, 10. Century]]

Some German sacred formulae, known as the "[[Merseburger Zaubersprüche]]" ("Merseburg Charms") were written down in c AD 800 and survived to the present time. One (this is the second of the two) describes Wodan in the role of a healer:

:be it limbsprain, bone to bones
:blood to blood, limb to limbs
:like they are glued!
|}

Further, the creation of the [[runes]] is attributed to Odin and is described in the [[Rúnatal]],  a section of the [[Hávamál]]. He hanged himself from the tree called [[Yggdrasill]] whilst pierced by his own spear in order to acquire knowledge. He remained thus for nine days and nights, a significant number in Norse magical practice (there were, for example, [[The Nine Worlds of Norse Mythology|nine realms of existence]]), thereby learning nine (later eighteen) magical songs and eighteen magical runes. The purpose of this strange ritual, a god sacrificing himself to himself because there was nothing higher to sacrifice to, was ostensibly to obtain mystical insight through mortification of the flesh.

Some scholars see this scene as influenced by the story of [[Christ]]'s [[crucifixion]]; and others note the similarity to the story of [[Gautama Buddha]]'s enlightenment. It is in any case also influenced by shamanism, where the symbolic climbing of a "world tree" by the shaman in search of mystic knowledge is a common religious pattern. We know that sacrifices, human or otherwise, to the gods were commonly hung in or from trees, often transfixed by spears. (See also: [[Peijainen]]) Additionally, one of Odin's names is ''Ygg'', and the Norse name for the World Ash &mdash;[[Yggdrasill]]&mdash;therefore means "Ygg's (Odin's) horse". Another of Odin's names is ''Hangatýr'', the god of the hanged.

Odin's desire for wisdom can also be seen in his work as a farmhand for a summer, for [[Baugi]], in order to obtain the mead of poetry. See [[Fjalar and Galar]] for more details.

== Worship  ==
[[Image:Ardre Odin Sleipnir.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Odin]] entering [[Valhalla]] riding on [[Sleipnir]], welcomed by a [[Valkyrie]] as depicted on the 8th century [[Tjängvide image stone]].]]
Details of the [[Migration period]] of Germanic religion are sketchy, reconstructed from artifacts, sparse contemporary sources, and the later testimonies of medieval legends and placenames. It was common, particularly amongst the [[Cimbri]], to sacrifice a prisoner to Odin prior to or after a battle. 

According to [[Jonas Bobiensis]], the 6th century Irish missionary [[Saint Columbanus]] is reputed to have disrupted a [[Symbel|Beer sacrifice]] to Wuodan (''Deo suo Vodano nomine'') in [[Bregenz]], [[Alemannia]]. Wuodan was the chief god of the [[Alamanni]], his name appears in the runic inscription on the [[Nordendorf fibula]]. 

[[Germanic paganism|Pagan]] worship disappeared with [[Christianization]], between the 6th and 8th centuries in England and Germany, lingering until the 11th or 12th century in Iceland and Scandinavia. Remnants of worship were continued into modern times as [[folklore]] (see [[Germanic Christianity]]).

It has been argued that the killing of a combatant in battle was to give a sacrificial offering to Odin. The fickleness of Odin in battle was well-documented, and in [[Lokasenna]], [[Loki]] taunts Odin for his inconsistency.

[[Adam of Bremen]] in the 12th century relates that every ninth year, people assembled from all over [[Sweden]] to sacrifice at the [[Temple at Uppsala]]. Male slaves, and males of each species were sacrificed and hanged from the branches of the trees.  As the Swedes had the right not only to elect a king but also to depose a king, the [[sagas]] relate that both king [[Domalde]] and king [[Olof Trätälja]] were sacrificed to Odin after years of famine. Sometimes sacrifices were made to Odin to bring about changes in circumstance. A notable example is the sacrifice of King [[Víkar]] that is detailed in [[Gautrek's Saga]] and in [[Saxo|Saxo Grammaticus]]' account of the same event. Sailors in a fleet being blown off course drew lots to sacrifice to Odin that he might abate the winds. The king himself drew the lot and was hanged. Sacrifices were probably also made to Odin at the beginning of summer, since [[Ynglinga saga]] states one of the great festivals of the calendar is ''at sumri, þat var sigrblót'' "in summer, for victory".

==Migration period==
{{main|Woden}}
The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tribes brought their pagan faith to [[England]] around the 5th and 6th centuries and continued in that form of [[worship]] until nearly all were converted to Christianity by the 8th century. The Anglo-Saxon kings claimed descent from Woden. According to the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] and the [[Historia Britonum]], Woden had the sons [[Wecta]], [[Baeldaeg]], [[Casere]] and [[Wihtlaeg]], who in turn were ancestors of the royal houses of the [[Heptarchy]]. Other manifestations of Woden in England are confined to a scattering of [[British toponymy|place-names]] and an even smaller number of literary mentions in the [[Old English language|Old English]] poems [[Maxims I]] (line 132) and in the so-called [[Nine Herbs Charm]] (line 32). 

Lombardic ''Godan'' appears in the 7th century ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]''. According to the legend presented there, Godan's wife, [[Frea]] favoured the Lombards, at the time still called ''Winnili'', and tricked Godan into helping them by having the women of the Winnili tie their hair in front of their faces. Godan thought that they were warriors with impressive beards and named them ''Langobardi'' "longbeards".

==Viking Age==
{{main|Óðinn}}
[[Image:Manuscript Odinn.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Odin with his ravens and weapons]]
Scandinavian ''Óðinn'' emerged from [[Proto-Norse]] ''*Wōdin'' during the [[Migration period]], [[Vendel]] artwork ([[bracteate]]s, [[image stone]]s) depicting the earliest scenes that can be aligned with the High Medieval Norse mythological texts. The context of the new elites emerging in this period aligns with [[Snorri]]'s tale of the indigenous [[Vanir]] who were eventually replaced [[Aesir]] intruders from the Continent.[http://www.algonet.se/~arador/postfestum.html]

According to the [[Prose Edda]], Odin was a son of [[Bestla]] and [[Borr]] and brother of [[Ve|Vé]] and [[Vili]] and together with these brothers he cast down the frost giant [[Ymir]] and created the world from Ymir's body.

Attributes of Odin are [[Sleipnir]], an eight-legged horse, and the severed head of [[Mímir]], which foretold the future. He employed [[Valkyrjur]] to gather the souls of warriors fallen in battle (the [[Einherjar]]), as these would be needed to fight for him in the battle of [[Ragnarok|Ragnarök]]. They took the souls of the warriors to [[Valhalla]] (the hall of the fallen), Odin's residence in [[Asgard|Ásgarðr]].  One of the Valkyries, [[Brynhildr]], was expelled from his service but, out of compassion, Odin placed her in a hall surrounded by a ring of fire to ensure that only the bravest man could seek her hand in marriage.  She was rescued by [[Sigurd]]. [[Höðr]], a blind god who had accidentally killed his brother, [[Baldr]], was then killed by another of Odin's children, [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]], whose mother was [[Rindr]], a giantess who bore him fully grown  and vowing not to even bathe before he had exacted vengeance on Höðr.

According to the [[Hávamál]] Edda, Odin was also the creator of the [[Runic alphabet]].  It is possible that the legends and genealogies  mentioning Odin originated in a real, prehistoric Germanic chieftain who was subsequently deified, but this is impossible to prove or disprove.

== Medieval reception ==
As the chief god of the Germanic pantheon, Odin received particular attention from the early missionaries. For example, his day is the only day to have been renamed in the [[German language]] from "Woden's day", still extant in English ''Wednesday'' (compare Norwegian, Danish and Swedish ''onsdag'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''woensdag'') to the neutral ''Mittwoch'' ("mid-week"), while other gods were not deemed important enough for propaganda (''Tuesday'' "[[Tyr]]'s day" and ''Friday'' "[[Freyja]]'s day" remained intact in all Germanic languages, except Icelandic).
"Woden's day" is thought to translate the [[Latin]] ''Dies Mercurii'', "Mercury-day" (cf. French ''mercredi'', Tuscan ''mercoledì''), owing primarily to [[Tacitus]]' linking of the two gods.

For many Germans, [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]] replaced Wotan, and many mountain chapels dedicated to St. Michael can be found, but Wotan also remained present as a sort of demon leading the [[Wild hunt]] of the host of the dead, e.g. in Swiss folklore as ''Wuotis Heer''. However, in some regions even this mythology was transformed so that [[Charlemagne]] led the hunt, not Odin.

In Anglo-Saxon England, Woden was more often [[Euhemerus|euhemerised]] than demonised. In [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' and the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], Woden appears as a perfectly earthly king, only four generations removed from [[Hengest and Horsa]], though up to the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] and after there remained an awareness that he had once been "mistaken" for a god.

[[Snorri Sturluson]]'s record of the Edda is striking evidence of the climate of religious tolerance in medieval Iceland, but even he feels compelled to give a rational account of the Aesir in his preface. In this scenario, Snorri speculates that Odin and his peers were originally refugees from [[Troy]], etymologizing ''Aesir'' as derived from [[Asia]]. Some scholars believe that Snorri's version of Norse mythology is an attempt to mould a more shamanistic tradition into a Greek mythological cast. In any case, Snorri's writing (particularly in [[Heimskringla]]) tries to maintain an essentially scholastic neutrality. That Snorri was correct was one of the last of [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s archeo-anthropological theories (see [[Jakten på Odin|The search for Odin]]).

==Revivals==
With the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[Viking revival]] of the early-to-mid 19th century, Odin's popularity increased again. Wotan is a lead character in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', written between 1848 and 1874.

His name provides the root for 19th century conceptions of "[[Odic force|Od]]", a hypothetical vital energy that permeates all living things.

Odin, along with the other Norse Gods and Goddesses, is worshipped by [[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic pagan reconstructivist]]s (see [[Odinism]]). [[Ásatrú]], "faith in the [[Aesir]]", is an officially recognised religion in [[Iceland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]],[[Sweden]] and [[Spain]]. 

Odin is frequently referred to in [[popular culture]]. See [[Odin (disambiguation)]].
