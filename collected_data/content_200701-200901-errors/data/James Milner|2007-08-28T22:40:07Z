'''James Philip Milner''' (born [[January 4]] [[1986]], [[Horsforth]], [[West Yorkshire]]) is an [[English people|English]] [[footballer]] who plays for the English club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], as a [[winger (sport)|winger]] and left-sided [[midfielder]]. 

As a child Milner was recognised as a talent in football, [[cricket]] and as a [[long-distance track event|long distance runner]] representing his school in each. He also played football for teams from [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]] and [[Westbrook]]. He was a [[season ticket]] holder at [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] before becoming a ball boy at the club. 

He began his career at Leeds by joining the Leeds United academy and was later taken on as a trainee. He first appeared for the first team in 2002 at the age of 17. He came to prominence when he became the youngest player ever to score in the [[Premier League]]. Milner also had loan spells with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] before establishing himself in the Newcastle first team and he has now made over a hundred appearances for them. Outside of football he is an easygoing person who rarely speaks to the media. At international level, he has made a record 29 appearances for the [[England U21 national football team|England Under-21]] side. He remains part of the Newcastle starting eleven, featuring regularly in domestic and European games. 

==Early life==
Born and raised in [[Horsforth]], [[Leeds]], Milner played most of his football as a child for Horsforth School. While playing there, Graeme Coulson, a coach from [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]] recognised his talent and asked a parent who he was. Coulson persuaded Milner to play for his Rawdon side in various tournaments. The team won a prestigious tournament in Rawdon Meadows with Milner scoring four goals in the final.<ref name="Milner child"/>

Milner was a first class student at Horsforth School, leaving with 11 [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]],<ref name="findarticles"/> and winning an award for his performance in [[physical education]].<ref name="Milner child"/> Milner supported [[Leeds United]] from a very young age.

He was the cross-country champion for three consecutive years and the district champion over 100 metres for two years in row.<ref name="Milner child"/>

When Milner was ten he joined the Leeds United Academy after he was spotted by a [[scout (sport)|scout]] while playing for [[Westbrook]]. However, his father insisted that he attend college once a week to keep up with his education.<ref name="findarticles2">{{cite web

==Career==
===Leeds United===
Milner's début for [[Leeds United]] came on [[10 November]] [[2002]] when he replaced [[Jason Wilcox]] for the final six minutes in a game against [[West Ham United]]. The appearance made him the second youngest player ever to play in the [[Premier League]], at the age of 16 years and 309 days old.<ref name="ESPN"/> On [[Boxing Day]] he became the youngest scorer in the history of the Premier League with a goal in a 2&ndash;1 win against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].<ref>{{cite web

At the start of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003&ndash;04 season]], Milner was sent on a month-long loan to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] to gain experience as a first team player, which he saw as a "valuable experience".<ref name="findarticles"/> He spent a month with Swindon, scoring two goals in six games. On the international scene, Milner continued to develop, representing the England Under-20 team at the [[2003 FIFA World Youth Championship|2003 World Youth Championship]]. Not long after, [[Peter Taylor]] called him up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 side]]. His début for the side came against [[Sweden national under-21 football team|Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Chopra earns U21s draw | author=Gerry Cox | url=http://www.thefa.com/England/U21s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/03/SwedenU21vEnglandU21_MR.htm | accessdate=June 20 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref>

However, Milner's club's fortunes differed somewhat as Leeds began to struggle in the league. Milner believed the experience made him stronger emotionally and it taught him how to deal with team problems.<ref name="findarticles"/> Their [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] to [[Football League Championship|the Championship]] led to speculation over Milner's future at the club, although he had signed a five-year deal with Leeds a year before. He rejected a new and improved contract, which offered to double his wages. [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] all expressed an interest in him,<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web

The chairman of the team at the time even referred to him as "the future of Leeds".<ref name="findarticles"/> But financial problems eventually forced them to sell him to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] after accepting an offer of £3,600,000. This deal rose to £5,000,000 after a certain amount of appearances. He was not happy to be leaving the club he had supported as a child but wished to do what was in the club's interest.<ref name="findarticles"/> In July 2004, Milner agreed a five-year deal with Newcastle.<ref name="ESPN"/>

Following the sacking of manager [[Bobby Robson]], new manager [[Graeme Souness]] allowed Milner to start 13 league games. The midfielder played his first full Premier League game for Newcastle on [[24 April]] [[2005]], and made 41 appearances in all competitions by the season's end, scoring once. However, he was frustrated at not being used as a starter for most of the season. The [[2004-05 in English football|2004&ndash;05]] season was also where Milner scored his first goal for the England Under-21 side against [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales]] in a qualification game for the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2007 European Under-21 Championship]] which England won 2&ndash;0.<ref>{{cite web

At the start of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005&ndash;06]] season Milner scored his first European goal in a 3&ndash;1 win away against [[FK ZTS Dubnica]] in the [[Intertoto Cup]],<ref>{{cite web

Milner's vein of form continued when he scored again in the next round against [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo la Coruña]], but a clause in Newcastle's purchase of [[Nolberto Solano]] from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] resulted in Milner being loaned to Villa for the rest of the season.

Milner made his Villa début on 12 September against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]]. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1&ndash;1 draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 17 September. He then helped his side recover from being 3&ndash;1 down at half-time against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] with two goals in an 8&ndash;3 win. Although his side made a poor start to the season, Milner remained confident that they would recover after a break for international duty, praising the quality of the squad and the team's spirit.<ref name="team">{{cite web

Negotiations between Villa and Newcastle regarding the possibility of Villa signing Milner permanently began in May. Newly appointed Newcastle manager [[Glenn Roeder]] appeared to have more appreciation for Milner's ability than Souness had shown, and expressed his desire to keep him at Newcastle. With a lack of transfer funds at Villa, in addition to a change of management at the club, a deal appeared unlikely. In June Villa rejected an offer for him to be part of a trade for [[Gareth Barry]].<ref>{{cite web

Villa made an improved offer to Newcastle on 30 August, after deliberations it was accepted by Newcastle chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]]. Media sources quoted the transfer fee as being £4,000,000. However Newcastle then recalled Milner and the talks broke down.<ref name="Roeder">{{cite web

He also highly praised Milner's ability and confirmed he would play him in "plenty of games".<ref name="Roeder"/> This proved to be the case, as Milner started the season playing regularly in the first team and remained a starter for the entire season. He also continued to impress at international level, as he helped the England Under-21 side reach the play-offs of qualifying for the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|Under-21 European Championship]] by scoring the winning goal of a 3&ndash;2 win over [[Switzerland national under-21 football team|Switzerland]]. Newcastle made a poor start to the season in the Premier League but Milner played a key role in helping them advance through the group stage of the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|UEFA Cup]]. Rumours began to spread in December 2006 that he would be sold during the [[transfer window]], although Milner and Roeder both dismissed them.<ref>{{cite web

==Style of play==
Milner has a positive and unselfish attitude towards his teammates.<ref name="team"/> As a result he is not a prolific goal scorer, but does produce a high number of assists. He has also expressed willingness to play as much as possible, saying that he is "bored" when not playing.<ref>{{cite web

He is regarded as a player with a fair amount of pace and for this reason his main role on the team is as a wide midfielder, creating scoring opportunities as well as taking the ball past defenders. His awareness of players around him and his willingness to pass has been described as mature for a player of his age,<ref name="Chelsea"/> which allows him to pick out a forward run being made by a teammate from a range of positions on the field. His awareness has also given him the confidence to take on defenders. Milner has a good discipline record, having never been sent off and [[Misconduct (football)|booked]] 15 times in his career.<ref name="stats"/><ref name="footballanorak">{{cite web

He displays maturity beyond that expected from someone of his age, he lives with his parents and sister. 

His nickname at Newcastle is "Machine Gun", after his teammates were impressed by his [[darts]] ability.<ref>{{cite web
