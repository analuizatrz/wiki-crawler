''This article is about the City of Lake Charles, La. For the lake after which this city was 
named, see "[[Lake Charles (body of water)]]."

'''Lake Charles''', ([[French language|French]]: ''Lac Charles''), is the fifth largest [[city]] in the [[US state]] of [[Louisiana]]. It is the [[parish seat]] of [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu Parish]] and is the urban center of the southwest region of the state. As of the 2000 [[census]], the city had a total population of 71,757. 

Lake Charles is known as the Festival Capital of Louisiana with over 75 festivals held annually in the Lake Charles area. The city is a major [[petrochemical]] refining center, gaming center with three riverboat [[casino]]s, and home to [[McNeese State University]].

== History ==
=== Settlement & Incorporation ===  
[[Image:Boardwalk LakeCharlesLA.jpg|thumb|300px|The boardwalk on Lake Charles.]]
While several [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes are known to have lived in the area of modern Lake Charles, the first [[Europe]]an people, of [[France|French]], [[Spain|Spanish]], [[England|English]], and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] descent, arrived in the 1760s. At the time, the area was covered with dense [[pine]] and [[Taxodium distichum|baldcypress]] forests. Oral tradition holds that [[Jean Lafitte]] frequented Contraband Bayou and the lake before and after the [[War of 1812]].

M. and Mme. LeBleu of [[Bordeaux, France]] were the first recorded Europeans to settle the area around [[1781]]. The area they settled is now known as the LeBleu Settlement. [[Charles Sallier]] married LeBleu's daughter, Catherine. The Salliers built their home on the shell beach where Lake Charles now stands. Afterwards, the lake became known as "Charlie's lake." By 1860 this area was called "Charles Town." Many of Charles Sallier's descendants are buried in Sallier Cemetery, near St. Patrick's Hospital.

The Rio Hondo, which flowed through [[Lake Charles (body of water)|Lake Charles]], was later called ''Quelqueshue'', an Indian term meaning "Crying Eagle," and still later, [[Calcasieu Parish|Calcasieu]]. On [[March 7]], [[1861]], Lake Charles was incorporated as the town of Charleston, Louisiana.

The growth of the city was fairly slow until Captain Daniel Goos, a [[Frisians|Frisian]] by birth, came in 1855. Goos established a [[lumber]] mill and [[schooner]] dock, now called Goosport, and promoted a profitable trade with [[Texas]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] ports by sending his schooner down-river into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Until the arrival of Goos, a man named Jacob Ryan dominated the lumber industry. Between 1817 and 1855, the timber provided by [[Longleaf Pine]]s and Baldcypress remained the primary industry.

Jacob Ryan convinced the state government to move the parish seat to Lake Charles from its former location at Marion, which was about 8 miles upriver. Later that year, Ryan and Samuel Kirby transferred the parish courthouse and jail by barge to Lake Charles, which was at that time still called Charleston. Six years after the city was incorporated, dissatisfaction over the name Charleston arose. On [[March 16]], [[1867]], Charleston, Louisiana, was incorporated into the town of Lake Charles.

By the time of the [[U.S. Civil War]], many English and northeastern Americans, along with a large influx of continental Europeans and [[Jew]]ish people, had come to settle the area. Attitudes toward slavery in Lake Charles were mixed as slavery was secondary to business interests. Fewer than 5% of the population were [[slavery|slave]]s. The citizenry finally became involved in the war, and young men of local families went to serve the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

=== Post Civil War ===

After the Civil War, Lake Charles had become a major lumber town. The mills of the area were swamped with orders. The 1880s saw what was a small sawmill village develop into a boom town. This was largely due to the innovative advertising methods of a man named J.B. Watkins. With his astounding $200,000 advertising campaign, the town grew 400% in the '80s.

By the 1890s, finer homes were being built. Carpenters struggled to outbuild each other with their use of elaborate fretwork and [[Victorian era]] decoration. Fancy spindles, newel posts, soldiers and paneled doors - all native of native pine - filled the houses.

The courthouse donated by Ryan and Kirby was replaced many times, a cypress wood two-story one in 1872, then a brick one in 1890. The 1890 courthouse was destroyed in the "Great Fire of 1910." The historic Calcasieu Courthouse was completed in 1912, two months after the Louisiana legislature divided old "Imperial Calcasieu" parish into the current parishes of Allen, Beauregard, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Calcasieu.

After [[World War II]] Lake Charles experienced industrial growth with the onset of the petrochemical refining industries. The city grew to a height of 80,000 people in the early 1980s, but with economic recession, the population declined. As of the 2000 [[census]], the city had a total population of 71,757.

=== Present-Day === 
[[Image:ritadestr1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Destructive force of Hurricane Rita. Looking down the remains of the lakefront boardwalk toward the damaged Harrah's Lake Charles Casino property.]]
[[Pinnacle Entertainment]] opened their first riverboat [[casino]] in the Lake Charles area in May 2005. The name of the resort, [[L'Auberge du Lac Resort|L'Auberge du Lac]], comes from the [[French language|French]] for "The Lake's Inn." The casino includes an 18-hole, championship [[golf course]] designed by [[Tom Fazio]], several dining venues, a spa and salon, a pool area complete with lazy river, and several retail stores. It employs over 2000 citizens.

Lake Charles suffered extensive damage from [[Hurricane Rita]], which struck the town early [[September 24]], [[2005]]. On [[September 22]], Mayor Randy Roach ordered a mandatory evacuation of Lake Charles, and approximately 90% of the residents evacuated prior to the storm. Evacuees were asked not to return for 48 hours, due to the wind damage and flooding. There was extensive damage to the city's [[electrical grid]] as some areas took as long as three weeks to restore power. Many apartment residents had to be evicted because of the mold caused by the [[hurricane]]. 

As part of the city's recovery from [[Hurricane Rita]], elected officials proposed a plan to renovate the downtown area to make it more pedestrian-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. Charrettes were held presenting architectural concept drawings and ideas of what downtown Lake Charles could look like in future years. Of primary concern was quality and affordable housing to help revitalize the area, and at the same time provide more housing for the housing shortage in the last few years. A parish-wide ballot initiative to increase sales and property taxes for 20 years to fund this proposal and numerous local road projects was rejected by taxpayers on [[July 15]], [[2006]].

On [[June 20]], [[2006]] a [[Citgo]] Petroleum Plant located in [[Westlake, Louisiana|Westlake]] released between 15,000 and 18,000 barrels of [[oil]] into the Calcasieu Ship Channel. The [[United States Coast Guard]] was called in to contain the spilled oil which flowed down the [[Calcasieu River]]; closures of many waterways included the Calcasieu River Channel and one mile of the [[Gulf Intracoastal Waterway]]. The Port of Lake Charles remained closed for some time after the disaster due to contamination.<ref>Atkinson, Vince. "Lake Charles Port All But Shuts Down." KPLC-TV, June 20, 2006.[http://www.kplctv.com/Global/story.asp?s=5073114]</ref>

Oil prices surged to over $74 per barrel in part due to the Citgo spillage. The Calcasieu Refining  Co., which normally processes 765,000 barrels a day, was at low levels weeks after the accident.<ref>Shevory, Kristina. "Oil Holds Above $74 a Barrel." TheStreet.com, July 12, 2006. [http://www.thestreet.com/_tscrss/markets/energy/10296296.html]</ref>

Lake Charles is home to several [[Protestant]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christian denominations as well, which when combined, comprise the majority of the population.

A substantial portion of the population affiliates itself with [[Judaism]]. Notably, there is an [[atheist]] group as well. Particular elements of [[Voodoo]] are recognizable in the area; namely, [[Hoodoo]], as one can spot jars filled with animal organs placed around graves and hanging from trees in the pauper cemetery on Broad Street.

== Holidays and Festivitals ==
Lake Charles plays host to over one hundred festivals and carnivals which give the city its nickname, "The Festival Capital of Louisiana."
===Contraband Days===
:{{main|Contraband Days}}

Contraband Days is a 12-day, annual festival in early May filled with savory [[cajun]] food, family fun and festivities, including entertainment with live bands, and is attended by more than 200,000 people. It is one of the largest celebrations in [[Louisiana]], second only to [[Mardi Gras]].
The festival begins when when pirate [[Jean Lafitte]] captures the port and throws 
the mayor of the city of Lake Charles into Lake Charles; i.e. the lake itself. It normally takes place sometime between the last two weeks of April or the first two weeks of May.

=== Mardi Gras ===
[[Mardi Gras]] in Southwest Louisiana has a colorful history dating back to [[1882]], when Momus, King of Mardi Gras, landed his royal yacht at the foot of Pujo Street in downtown Lake Charles.
 
Throughout the two World Wars, [[Mardi Gras]] was downsized which lead to a lack of participation by the area's youth. However, an interest to redevelop the festivities arose, and the first Mardi Gras Ball in the Lake Charles area was staged in [[1964]].

The full revival of [[Mardi Gras]] in Lake Charles was not realized until 1979, when several [[Krewe]] captains formed the "Krewe of Krewes" with the prime purpose of parading and promoting Mardi Gras for local residents. In [[1985]], '''Mardi Gras of Imperial Calcasieu, Inc.''' was formed by a group of civic-minded volunteers to further aid in the preservation of this festival.<ref>"History of Mardi Gras in Southwest Louisiana."[http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/7288/lcmardigras.html]</ref>
