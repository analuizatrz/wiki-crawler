'''Interstate H-201''' ('''H-201''') is an auxiliary [[Interstate highway]] located on the island of [[Oahu|O‘ahu]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The H-201 is also known as the '''Moanalua Freeway'''.  The 4-mile loop route connects exits 13 and 19 on [[Interstate H-1]], passing [[Fort Shafter]], [[Tripler Army Medical Center]], and Red Hill.

Despite being designated an Interstate in [[1989]], until recently the route was a "hidden" Interstate signed only as '''Route 78'''.  Interstate signs started appearing in mid-2004.  The section of the Moanalua Freeway between [[Hawaii Route 99|Route 99]] (Kamehameha Highway) and the western Interstate H-1 interchange remains designated as Route 78.

The length of H-201 was originally designated as Route 78.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Hawaii/randmcnally_ra_1989_003.html|title=Rand McNally Road Atlas|year=1989|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>

The Federal Highway Administration approved the addition of Interstate H-201 to the Interstate Highway System on November 1, 1989.  The Hawai‘i Department of Transportation asked that the Moanalua Freeway be reclassified as an Interstate so that the interchange with H-1 at the eastern end could conform to federal highway standards.  At first, the highway was initially designated H-1A, but federal highway policy does not allow alphabetic suffixes in Interstate numbers.  The final designation, H-201, conforms to the general rules for three-digit Interstate "loop" routes.

Until 2004, the state Department of Transportation chose not to sign H-201 as such, instead retaining the designation Route 78.  Reasons given included:
* inability to render the new route number in a legible manner (it is necessary to use the thinnest font to render the number, as seen above, and the shield is wider than the standard interstate shield)
* encouraging motorists to use the newer and better designed H-1
* avoiding confusion with [[Interstate H-2]]

In July [[2004]], in conjunction with a major resurfacing of both sides of the freeway, it was decided to bring the signage in line with the official designation.
