''Not to be confused with the defunct [[Philadelphia Quakers (NHL)|Philadelphia Quakers]] team of the [[National Hockey League]], the Philadelphia Quakers baseball team who became the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in 1890 or the [[University of Pennsylvania]] athletics teams, the [[Pennsylvania Quakers]].''

The '''Philadelphia Quakers''' were a professional [[American football]] team that competed in the [[AFL I|first American Football League]] in [[1926 American Football League season|1926]] and won the league’s only championship. Owned by L. S. Conway,<ref> "A.F.L. Fields Nine Teams" ''[[New York Times]]'', July 17, 1926</ref> the Quakers played their home games in [[Sesquicentennial Stadium]] on Saturdays due to [[Pennsylvania]]’s [[Blue law]]s prohibiting work or business on Sundays. Coached by [[Bob Folwell]], the majority of the team played their college football in [[Pennsylvania]].<ref> David S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch, ''The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football, From 1892 to the Present'' (St. Martin’s Press 1994), ISBN 0-312-11435-4</ref> The Quakers had nine players (including [[Century Milstead]], [[Charlie Way]], [[Butch Spagna]], and [[Bull Behman]]) who had previously played for various [[National Football League]] teams. The combined experience gave the team an edge in line play, particularly on defense (the Quakers yielded only five points per game for the 1926 season). The addition of [[All-American]] [[Glenn Killinger]] merely added to the defensive riches: he intercepted four passes in his league debut (November 4, 1926, in a 24-0 victory over the [[Rock Island Independents]]).<ref>[http://aflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1926a.pdf 1926 American Football League from Elias Sports Bureau and Pro Football Research Association Linescore Committee]</ref>

Unlike half of their league opponents, the Quakers had no financial connection with league founders [[C. C. Pyle]] and [[Red Grange]]. In addition to having a championship team, the Quakers drew well in the stadium in the midst of the [[Sesquicentennial Exposition]]. When the fair ended (early November), the audience in the soon-to-be renamed Municipal Stadium diminished, but still drew well when the Quakers defeated the [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]] 13-7 on a [[Bob Dinsmore]] punt return that decided the game - and the league championship (November 27, 1926).<ref>[http://aflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1926a.pdf 1926 American Football League from Elias Sports Bureau and Pro Football Research Association Linescore Committee]</ref><ref> David S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch, ''The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football, From 1892 to the Present'' (St. Martin’s Press 1994), ISBN 0-312-11435-4</ref>

At the time of the championship-clinching game, the AFL had only four active teams (the Quakers, the Yankees, the [[Los Angeles Wildcats]], and the [[Chicago Bulls (AFL)|Chicago Bulls]]), three of which were being subsidized by C. C. Pyle and Red Grange. <ref> David S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch, ''The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football, From 1892 to the Present'' (St. Martin’s Press 1994), ISBN 0-312-11435-4</ref> The latter three teams played games in the last two weeks of the season while the Quakers started challenging [[National Football League]] teams for a “pro football championship game.” The [[NFL championship|NFL champions]] [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] were the first to refuse, claiming that their postseason schedule had been already set. Additional challenges by the Quakers were unanswered until [[Tim Mara]], owner of the seventh place [[New York Giants]], accepted the challenge, scheduling a game for December 12, 1926, at the [[Polo Grounds]].

As the Yankees and the Bulls were playing the AFL’s last official game (a 7-3 Yankees victory in [[Comiskey Park]]), <ref>[http://aflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1926a.pdf 1926 American Football League from Elias Sports Bureau and Pro Football Research Association Linescore Committee]</ref>  the Quakers and the Giants were battling in front of 5000 fans in the middle of a driving snowstorm. While the score was only 3-0 at [[halftime]], Quaker errors led to the Giants winning the game 31-0.<ref>[http://home.comcast.net/~ghostsofthegridiron/Quakers_NY-Giants_1926.htm "New York Giants Beat Quakers in Slop, 31-0"] – ''The Philadelphia Record'', December 13, 1926</ref> Both the Quakers and the AFL were no more.

At the end of the season, [[Wilfred Smith]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' presented a combined NFL-AFL [[All-Pro|All Pro]] team in his column. Three Quakers were named to the second team: George Tully, [[Bull Behman]], and [[Al Kreuz]].<ref>[http://www.footballresearchers.org/The_Coffin_Corner 1926 All Pros] – John Hogrogian, citing ''Chicago Tribune'', December 19, 1926</ref>

==After the first AFL==

Upon the completion of a [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]] 7-3 victory over the [[Chicago Bulls (AFL)|Chicago Bulls]] in [[Comiskey Park]]  on December 12, 1926, the first AFL was officially dead.<ref>[http://nflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1926a.pdf 1926 American Football League] – week-by-week history by the [[Elias Sports Bureau]] and the Professional Football Researchers Association Linescore Committee</ref> The simultaneous 31-0 drubbing of the Quakers by the [[New York Giants]] in the [[Polo Grounds]] left the AFL champions in a similar state.<ref>[http://www.footballresearchers.org/Articles/The_Grange_War.pdf The Grange War: 1926] – Bob Carroll, Professional Football Researchers Association</ref>

It was, however, not the end of the professional football career for five Philadelphia Quakers. The following men were on rosters of NFL teams in the [[1927 NFL season|1927 season]]: <ref> David S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch, ''The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football, From 1892 to the Present'' (St. Martin's Press 1994), ISBN 0-312-11435-4</ref>

Bob Beattie – 1927 New York Yankees, 1929 [[Orange Tornadoes]], 1930 [[Newark Tornadoes]]<br>
Bull Behman – 1927-31 [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] ([[player-coach]] 1930-31)<br>
Adrian Ford – 1927 [[Pottsville Maroons]], 1927 Frankford Yellow Jackets<br>
Century Milstead – 1927-28 New York Giants<br>
George Tully – 1927 Frankford Yellow Jackets</br>

On the other hand, the pro football careers of several former NFL players ended with the 1926 Quakers:

Charlie Cartin – 1925 Frankford Yellow Jackets, 1926 Quakers<br>
Saville Crowther – 1925 Frankford Yellow Jackets, 1926 Quakers<br>

Whitey Thomas – 1924 Frankford Yellow Jackets, 1926 Quakers<br>
