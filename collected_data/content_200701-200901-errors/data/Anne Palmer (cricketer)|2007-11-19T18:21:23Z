'''Anne Palmer''' is an international cricketer who played 3 matches for the [[Australia national women's cricket team]] in the inaugural series against the [[England women's cricket team]] in the 1934/35 season.

She formed a formidable spin partnership with [[Peggy Antonio]], the "Girl Grimmett", taking ten wickets at 12 apiece and scoring 92 runs at 15.33.  She had practiced with Antonio at a local school in her youth and the pair took 22 of the 35 wickets to fall in the rubber.  A right handed batsman she scored 92 runs in her three tests, with a best of 39, at 15.33.  Unfortunately she was unable to raise the money necessary to tour England with the team in 1937 and never played test cricket again.  

After winning a scholarship to continue her education she became [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s first uniformed policewoman.  At the age of 89, was presented with a 'baggy green' Australia cap and badge in a ceremony in 2004 at the offices of [[Cricket Australia]] in [[Melbourne]].

Interviewed after the ceremony she recalled how some of her team mates slept on luggage racks as they traveled by train around the country:
