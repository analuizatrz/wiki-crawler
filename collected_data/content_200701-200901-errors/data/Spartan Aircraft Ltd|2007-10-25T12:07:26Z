'''Spartan Aircraft Limited''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] aircraft manufacturer from [[1930 in aviation|1930]] to [[1935 in aviation|1935]].

==History==

In 1928 [[Oliver Simmonds]] designed and built a prototype aircraft the '''Simmonds Spartan'''. The design was a success with over 50 aircraft built. To capitalise on the success '''Simmonds Aircraft Limited''' changed name in [[1930 in aviation|1930]] to '''Spartan Aircraft Limited'''. The first aircraft from the renamed company was the [[Spartan Arrow]] a two-seat biplane of which 28 were built. The next design was a three-seat open-cockpit biplane the [[Spartan Three Seater]]. Spartan Aircraft's final product was the [[Spartan Cruiser]] a three-engined light plane developed from the Saro-Percival Mailplane. The company ceased to build aircraft in [[1935 in aviation|1935]].
