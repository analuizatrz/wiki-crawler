The '''apneustic center''' of the lower [[pons]] appears to promote [[Inhalation|inspiration]] by stimulation of the ''I'' neurons in the [[medulla oblongata]] providing a constant stimulus.

The apneustic centre of pons sends signals to the [[dorsal respiratory centre]] in the medulla to delay the 'switch off' signal of the inspiratory ramp provided by the [[Pneumotaxic center|pneumotaxic centre]] of pons.  It controls the intensity of breathing.The apneustic centre is inhibited by pulmonary strech receptors. it however gives positive impulses to the inspiratory (I) neurons

The pons apneustic center stimulates/prolongs inspiration
