{{Evolution3}}
The '''evolutionary history of [[life on Earth]]''' stretches back over {{ma|3000|}}, possibly as far as {{ma|3800}}, and there is evidence that [[evolution]] continues, even in humans. All present-day [[organism]]s use the same large set of complex [[chemical reaction]]s, which indicates that all modern organisms share a [[Last universal common ancestor|common ancestor]]. However even the simplest modern organisms are too complex to have emerged directly from non-living materials. Some scientists have proposed that life on Earth was [[panspermia|"seeded" from elsewhere]], but most research concentrates on various explanations of how life could have [[Abiogenesis|arisen independently]] on Earth.

For about 2,000 million years multi-layered [[microbial mat]]s were the dominant life on Earth. The evolution of [[Oxygen#Photosynthesis_and_respiration|oxygenic photosynthesis]] led to the [[Oxygen#Build-up_in_the_atmosphere|oxygenation of the atmosphere]], beginning about {{ma|2400}}. While [[eucaryotic]] cells may have been present earlier, their evolution accelerated when they acquired the ability to use oxygen as a powerful "fuel" for  their [[metabolism]]s. The earliest evidence of more complex eucaryotes with [[organelle]]s, "[[Organ (anatomy)|organs]]" within a cell, dates from {{ma|1850}}. [[Multicellular]] life is composed only of eucaryotic cells, and the earliest evidence for it is from {{ma|1700}}, although specialization of cells for different functions first appears between {{ma|1430}} ( a possible [[fungus]]) and {{ma|1200}} (a probable [[red alga]]). [[Sexual reproduction]] may be a prerequisite for specialization of cells.

The earliest known [[fossil]] [[animal]]s are [[cnidaria]]ns from about {{ma|580}}, although the earliest animals must have appeared before then. The earliest modern-looking [[bilateria]]n animals appear in the Early [[Cambrian]], along with several "weird wonders". There is a long-running debate about whether this [[Cambrian explosion]] was truly a very rapid period of evolutionary experimentation. [[Vertebrates]] remained an obscure group until the first fish with jaws appeared in the Late [[Ordovician]].

The earliest signs of land plants and land [[invertebrate]]s date back to about {{ma|476}} and {{ma|490}} respectively. The lineage that produced land vertebrates evolved very rapidly between {{ma|370}} and {{ma|360}}, and acquired limbs while they were still wholly aquatic. Land plants were so successful that they caused an [[ecological crisis]] in the Late [[Devonian]].

During the [[Permian]] period [[synapsid]]s, including the ancestors of [[mammal]]s, may have dominated land environments, but the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] {{ma|251}} came very close to wiping out complex life. During the slow recovery from this catastrophe, [[archosaur]]s became the most abundant terrestrial vertebrates. One archosaur group, the [[dinosaur]]s, were the dominant land vertebrates in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods, and [[bird]]s evolved from one group of dinosaurs. During this time mammals' ancestors could survive only as small, mainly nocturnal [[insectivore]]s, but this may have accelerated the development of mammalian traits. After the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]] {{ma|65}} killed off the non-avian dinosaurs – [[bird]]s are the only surviving dinosaurs – mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity, and some took to the air and the sea.

Fossil evidence indicates that [[flowering plant]]s appeared and rapidly diversified in the  Early [[Cretaceous]], between {{ma|130}} and {{ma|90}}, probably helped by [[coevolution]] with [[pollenation|pollinating]] insects. Flowering plants and marine [[phytoplankton]] are still the dominant [[Primary production|producers of organic matter]]. [[Social insects]] appeared around the same time as flowering plants. Although they occupy only small parts of the insect "family tree", they now form over half the total mass of insects.

Humans evolved from a lineage of upright-walking [[ape]]s whose earliest fossils date from over {{ma|6}}. Although early members of this lineage had [[chimp]]-sized [[brain]]s, there are signs of a steady increase in brain size after about {{ma|3}}.

The [[mass extinction]]s that have occurred at least since {{ma|542}} may have accelerated the evolution of life by making room for new groups of organisms to diversify. The fossil record shows a swift rise in [[biodiversity]] from {{ma|542|400}}, a slight decline from {{ma|400|200}}, and a swift rise from {{ma|200}} to the present.

Research on how life might have emerged unaided from non-living chemicals focuses on three possible starting points: [[self-replication]], an organism's ability to produce offspring that are very similar to itself; [[metabolism]], its ability to feed and repair itself; and external [[cell membrane]]s, which allow food to enter and waste products to leave, but exclude unwanted substances.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peretó, J. |title=Controversies on the origin of life |url=http://www.im.microbios.org/0801/0801023.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Int.

====Metabolism first: Iron-sulfur world====
{{main|Iron-sulfur world theory}}
A series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that early stages in the formation of [[protein]]s from inorganic materials including [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] could be achieved by using [[iron sulfide]] and [[nickel sulfide]] as [[catalyst]]s. Most of the steps required temperatures of about {{convert|100|°C|°F}} and moderate pressures, although one stage required {{convert|250|°C|°F}} and a pressure equivalent to that found under {{convert|7|km|mi}} of rock. Hence it was suggested that self-sustaining synthesis of [[protein]]s could have occurred near [[hydrothermal vent]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

[[RNA]] is complex and there are doubts about whether it can be produced non-biologically  in the wild.<ref name="RNANaturalSynthesisProblems" /> Some [[clay]]s, notably [[montmorillonite]], have properties that make them plausible accelerators for the emergence of an [[RNA world]]: they grow by self-replication of their [[crystal]]line pattern; they are subject to an analog of [[natural]] selection, as the clay "species" that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant; and they can [[catalyst|catalyze]] the formation of RNA molecules.<ref>{{citation

Research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of [[fatty acid]]s into "bubbles", and that the "bubbles" could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay. These "bubbles" can then grow by absorbing additional lipids and then divide. The formation of the earliest [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s may have been aided by similar processes.<ref>{{cite journal

{{main | Eucaryote}}
[[Eucaryote]]s may have been present long before the [[Oxygen#Build-up_in_the_atmosphere|oxygenation of the atmosphere]],<ref name="GlansdorffXuLabedan2008LUCA" /> but most modern eucaryotes require oxygen, which their [[mitochondria]] use to fuel the production of [[ATP]], the internal energy supply of all known cells.<ref name="HedgesBlairEtAl2004molecularTimescaleOfEukaryoteEvolution" /> In the 1970s it was proposed and, after much debate, widely accepted that eucaryotes emerged as a result of a sequence of [[endosymbiosis|endosymbioses]] between "[[procaryote]]s". For example: a predatory micro-organism invaded a large procaryote, probably an [[archaea]]n, but the attack was neutralized, and the attacker took up residence and evolved into the first of the [[mitochondria]]; one of these [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s later tried to swallow a [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[cyanobacterium]], but the victim survived inside the attacker and the new combination became the ancestor of [[plant]]s; and so on. After each endosymbiosis began, the partners would have eliminated unproductive duplication of genetic functions by re-arranging their [[genome]]s, a process which sometimes involved transfer of genes between them.<ref>{{cite book

The initial advantages of multicellularity  may have included: increased resistance to predators, many of which attacked by engulfing; the ability to resist currents by attaching to a firm surface; the ability to reach upwards to filter-feed or to obtain sunlight for photosynthesis;<ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /> and even the opportunity for a group of cells to behave "intelligently" by sharing information.<ref name="NakagakiYamadaTóth2000Intelligence">{{cite journal

}}</ref> These features would also have provided opportunities for other organisms to diversify, by creating more varied environments than flat [[microbial mat]]s could.<ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" />

Multicellularity with differentiated cells is beneficial to the organism as a whole but disadvantageous from the point of view of individual cells, most of which lose the opportunity to reproduce themselves. In an asexual multicellular organism, rogue cells which retain the ability to reproduce may take over and reduce the organism to a mass of undifferentiated cells. Sexual reproduction eliminates such rogue cells from the next generation and therefore appears to be a prerequisite for complex multicellularity.<ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" />

The available evidence indicates that eucaryotes evolved much earlier but remained inconspicuous until a rapid diversification around {{ma|1000}}. The only respect in which eucaryotes clearly surpass [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] is their capacity for variety of forms, and sexual reproduction enabled eucaryotes to exploit that advantage by producing organisms with multiple cells that differed in form and function.<ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" />

===How sex evolved===
{{Main|Evolution of sex}}
The defining characteristic of [[sexual reproduction]] is [[Genetic recombination | recombination]], in which each of the offspring receives 50% of its genetic inheritance from each of the parents.<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /> [[Bacteria]] also exchange [[DNA]] by [[bacterial conjugation]], the benefits of which include resistance to [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotics]] and other [[toxin]]s, and the ability to utilize new [[metabolite]]s.<ref name="Baron2">{{citation

The disadvantages of sexual reproduction are well-known: the genetic reshuffle of recombination may break up favorable combinations of genes; since males do not directly increase the number of offspring in the next generation, an asexual population can out-breed and displace in as little as 50 generations a sexual population that is equal in every other respect.<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage">{{citation

The [[Red Queen Hypothesis]] suggests that sexual reproduction provides protection against [[parasite]]s, because it is easier for parasites to evolve means of overcoming the defenses of genetically identical [[clone]]s than those of sexual species that present moving targets, and there is some experimental evidence for this. However there is still doubt about whether it would explain the survival of sexual species if multiple similar clone species were present, as one of the clones may survive the attacks of parasites for long enough to out-breed the sexual species.<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" />

The Mutation Deterministic Hypothesis assumes that each organism has more than one harmful [[mutation]] and the combined effects of these mutations are more harmful than the sum of the harm done by each individual mutation. If so, sexual recombination of genes will reduce the harm done that bad mutations do to offspring and at the same time eliminate some bad mutations from the [[gene pool]] by isolating them in individuals that perish quickly because they have an above-average number of bad mutations. However the evidence suggests that the MDH's assumptions are shaky, because many species have on average less than one harmful mutation per individual and no species that has been investigated shows evidence of [[synergy]] between harmful mutations.<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" />

The random nature of recombination causes the relative abundance of alternative traits to vary from one generation to another. This [[genetic drift]] is insufficient on its own to make sexual reproduction advantageous, but a combination of genetic drift and and [[natural selection]] may be sufficient. When chance produces combinations of good traits, natural selection gives a large advantage to lineages in which these traits become genetically linked. On the other hand the benefits of good traits are neutralized if they appear along with bad traits. Sexual recombination gives good traits the opportunities to become linked with other good traits, and mathematical models suggest this may be more than enough to offest the disadvantages of  sexual reproduction.<ref name="OttoGerstein2006WhySex" /> Other combinations of hypotheses that are inadequate on their own are also being examined.<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" />

In the 1970s there was already a debate about whether the emergence of the modern [[phylum|phyla]] was "explosive" or gradual but hidden by the shortage of [[Pre-Cambrian]] animal fossils.<ref name="Bengtson2004" /> A re-analysis of fossils from the [[Burgess Shale]] lagerstätte increased interest in the issue when it revealed animals, such as ''[[Opabinia]]'', which did not fit into any known [[phylum]].

==Colonization of land==

In aquatic algae, almost all cells are capable of photosynthesies and are nearly independent. Life on land required plants to become internally more complex and specialized: photosynthesis was most efficient at the top; roots were required in order to extract water from the ground; the parts in between became supports and transport systems for water and nutrients.<ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3P120To122" /><ref name="KenrickCrane1997EvolutionOfLandPlants" />

[[Spore]]s of land plants, possibly rather like [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, have been found in Mid [[Ordovician]] rocks dated to about {{ma|476}}.

[[Tetrapod]]s, vertebrates with four limbs, evolved from the most closely-related fish in a relatively short timespan in the Late [[Devonian]], from {{ma|370|}} to {{ma|360}}.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land, possibly in order to go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper. However in 1987 nearly-complete fossils of ''[[Acanthostega]]'' from about {{ma|363}} showed that this Late Devonian [[Transitional fossil|transitional]] animal had legs and both lungs and gills, but could never have survived on land: its limbs  and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight; its fish-like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground. The current hypothesis is that ''Acanthostega'', which was about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long, was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water<!-- , using its limbs to hold on to vegetation while it lay in ambush -->. Its skeleton differed from that of most fish, in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged, including: its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together, providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head; the head is not joined to the [[shoulder girdle]] and it has a distinct neck.<ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp">{{cite newspaper

The Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air-breathing would have been an advantage: leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish; air-breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen, since warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen.<ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp" />

Later discoveries revealed earlier transitional forms between ''Acanthostega'' and completely fish-like animals.<ref>{{cite journal

Some of these look like early relatives of modern [[amphibian]]s, most of which need to keep their skins moist and to lay their eggs in water, while others are accepted as early relatives of the [[amniote]]s, whose water-proof skins and eggs enable them to live and breed far from water.<ref name="AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods">{{cite journal

==Social insects==
{{main|Social insects}}
The [[social insect]]s are remarkable because the great majority of individuals in each colony are sterile. This appears contrary to basic concepts of evolution such as [[natural selection]] and the [[selfish gene]]. In fact there are very few [[eusocial]] insect species: only 15 out of approximately 2,600 living [[family (biology)|families]] of insects contain eusocial species, and it seems that eusociality has evolved independently only 12 times among [[arthropod]]s, although some eusocial lineages have diversified into several families. Nevertheless social insects have been spectacularly successful; for example although [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s account for only about 2% of known insect species, they form over 50% of the total mass of insects. Their ability to control a territory appears to be the foundation of their success.<ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences">{{cite journal

The sacrifice of breeding opportunities by most individuals has long been explained as a consequence of these species' unusual [[haplodiploid]] method of [[sex determination]], which has the paradoxical consequence that two sterile worker daughters of the same queen share more genes with each other than they would with their offspring if they could breed.<ref>{{cite journal

Wilson|Wilson]] and [[Bert Hölldobler|Hölldobler]] argue that this explanation is faulty: for example, it is based on [[kin selection]], but there is no evidence of [[nepotism]] in colonies that have multiple queens. Instead, they write, eusociality evolves only in species that are under strong pressure from predators and competitors, but in environments where it is possible to build "fortresses"; after colonies have established this security, they gain other advantages though co-operative foraging. In support of this explanation they cite the appearance of eusociality in [[Bathyergidae|bathyergid]] mole rats,<ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences" /> which are not haplodiploid.<ref>{{cite journal

The earliest fossils of insects have been found in Early Devonian rocks from about {{ma|400}}, which preserve only a few varieties of flightless insect. The [[Mazon Creek fossils|Mazon Creek lagerstätten]] from the Late [[Carboniferous]], about {{ma|300}}, include about 200 species, some gigantic by modern standards, and indicate that insects had occupied their main modern [[ecological niche]]s as [[herbivore]]s, [[detritivore]]s and [[insectivore]]s. Social termites and ants first appear in the Early [[Cretaceous]], and advanced social bees have been found in Late Cretaceous rocks but did not become abundant until the Mid [[Cenozoic]].<ref>{{citation

Life on earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since {{ma|542}}. Although they are disasters at the time, mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of [[life on earth]]. When dominance of particular [[ecological niche]]s passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.<ref>{{cite book | last=Benton | first =M.J. | title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | publisher=Blackwell | year=2004 | chapter=6.

The fossil record appears to show that the gaps between mass extinctions are becoming longer and the average and background rates of extinction are decreasing. Both of these phenomena could be explained in one or more ways:<ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction">{{cite web

*The oceans may have become more hospitable to life over the last 500&nbsp;million years and less vulnerable to mass extinctions: [[dissolved oxygen]] became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and [[anoxic event]]s; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that [[food chain]]s were less likely to be disrupted.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Martin| first= R.E.| year=1995| title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans| journal=Global and Planetary Change| volume =11| issue= 1| doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2| pages=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last=Martin| first= R.E.| year=1996| title=Secular increase in nutrient levels through the Phanerozoic: Implications for productivity, biomass, and diversity of the marine biosphere| journal=Palaios| volume= 11| pages=209–219| doi=10.2307/3515230}}</ref>
*Reasonably complete [[fossil]]s are very rare, most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils, and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks. So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned parts of the same organism to different [[genus|genera]] which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds – the story of ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' is an example of this. The risk of this mistake is higher for older fossils because these are often unlike parts of any living organism. Many of the "superfluous" genera are represented by fragments which are not found again and the "superfluous" genera appear to become extinct very quickly.<ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction" />

[[Biodiversity]] in the fossil record, which is
