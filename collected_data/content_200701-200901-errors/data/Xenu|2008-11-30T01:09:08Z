'''Xenu''', also '''Xemu''' ({{pron-en|ˈziːnuː}} or {{IPAlink-en|ˈziːmuː}}), was, according to [[Scientology]] founder (and [[science fiction]] writer) [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the [[dictator]] of the "[[Galactic Confederacy]]" who, 75 million years ago, brought billions<ref name=thmill>Thousands of millions in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]]</ref> of his people to Earth in [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]]-like spacecraft, stacked them around [[volcano]]es and killed them using [[Nuclear weapon#Fusion bombs|hydrogen bombs]]. Scientology holds that the essences of these many people remained, and that they form around people in modern times, causing them spiritual harm.<ref name=scott1>Scott, Michael Dennis (2004) "Internet And Technology Law Desk Reference", Aspen Publishers, ISBN 0735547432</ref><ref name=lewis1>Lewis James R (2003) "The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements", Oxford University Press, ISBN 0195149866</ref> Members of the [[Church of Scientology]] widely [[#Church_of_Scientology's_position|deny or try to hide]] the Xenu story.

These events are known within Scientology as "Incident II", and the traumatic memories associated with them as '''The Wall of Fire'''. The story of Xenu is part of Scientologist teachings about extraterrestrial civilizations and alien interventions in Earthly events, collectively described as ''[[Space opera in Scientology doctrine|space opera]]'' by Hubbard.  Hubbard detailed the story in [[Operating Thetan]] level III ('''OT III''') in 1967, warning that this material was <!-- DON'T FIX -->"calculated to kill (by [[pneumonia]] etc) anyone who attempts to solve it."<sup><nowiki>[</nowiki>''[[sic]]''<nowiki>]</nowiki></sup><!-- DON'T FIX That's an exact quote --><ref name="corydon1987" />

The Xenu story is part of the Church of Scientology's secret "Advanced Technology," normally only revealed to members who have already contributed large amounts of money.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Sappell | first = Joel | coauthors = Robert W.

==Summary==
[[Image:DC-8 72 overflight.jpg|200px|thumb|A contemporary DC-8 plane. Hubbard described the spacecraft as looking exactly like [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8s]] without "fans".]]
The story of Xenu is covered in OT III, part of Scientology's secret "Advanced Technology" doctrines taught only to advanced members who have undergone many expensive hours of [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] and reached the state of [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]. It is described in more detail in the accompanying confidential "Assists" lecture of 3 October 1968 and is dramatized in ''[[Revolt in the Stars]]'' (a [[screenplay]] written by L. Ron Hubbard in [[1977 in film|1977]]). Direct quotations in this section are from these sources. (See also [[Scientology beliefs and practices#Scientology language and terms (Scientologese)|Scientology beliefs and practices]])

Hubbard wrote that seventy-five million years ago, Xenu was the ruler of a Galactic Confederacy which consisted of 26 stars and 76 planets including Earth, which was then known as Teegeeack. The planets were overpopulated, each having an average population of 178 billion.<ref name=thmill/><ref name=scott1/><ref name=lewis1/> The Galactic Confederacy's civilization was comparable to our own, with aliens "walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like the clothes they wear this very minute" and using cars, trains and boats looking exactly the same as those "circa 1950, 1960" on Earth.<ref name="assists" />

Xenu was about to be deposed from power, so he devised a plot to eliminate the excess population from his dominions. With the assistance of [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], he summoned billions<ref name=thmill/> of his citizens together under the pretense of [[income tax]] inspections, then paralyzed them and froze them in a mixture of [[ethanol|alcohol]] and [[ethylene glycol|glycol]] to capture their souls. The kidnapped populace was loaded into spacecraft for transport to the site of extermination, the planet of Teegeeack (Earth). The appearance of these spacecraft would later be subconsciously expressed in the design of the [[Douglas DC-8]], the only difference being: "the DC8 had fans, propellers on it and the space plane didn't."<ref>{{cite web | work = Scientology Leader Gave ABC First-Ever Interview | title = ABC Interview Transcript |date=18 November 2006 | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=2664713|accessdate = 2008-08-02}}</ref> When they had reached Teegeeack/Earth, the paralyzed citizens were unloaded around the bases of volcanoes across the planet. [[Nuclear weapon#Fusion bombs|Hydrogen bomb]]s were then lowered into the volcanoes and detonated simultaneously.  Only a few aliens' physical bodies survived.  Hubbard described the scene in his film script, ''Revolt in the Stars'':{{Verify source|date=November 2008}}

{{quotation|Simultaneously, the planted charges erupted. Atomic blasts ballooned from the craters of Loa, Vesuvius, Shasta, Washington, Fujiyama, Etna, and many, many others. Arching higher and higher, up and outwards, towering clouds mushroomed, shot through with flashes of flame, waste and fission. Great winds raced tumultuously across the face of Earth, spreading tales of destruction. Debris-studded, and sickly yellow, the atomic clouds followed close on the heels of the winds. Their bow-shaped fronts encroached inexorably upon forest, city and mankind, they delivered their gifts of death and radiation. A skyscraper, tall and arrow-straight, bent over to form a question mark to the very idea of humanity before crumbling into the screaming city below...|L. Ron Hubbard, ''Revolt in the Stars'' treatment}}

The now-disembodied victims' souls, which Hubbard called ''thetans'', were blown into the air by the blast. They were captured by Xenu's forces using an "electronic ribbon" ("which also was a type of [[standing wave]]") and sucked into "vacuum zones" around the world. The hundreds of billions<ref>A billion in [[Long and short scales|Short Scale]] is a thousand million in Long Scale.</ref> of captured thetans were taken to a type of [[movie theater|cinema]], where they were forced to watch a "[[3-D film|three-D]], super colossal motion picture" for thirty-six days. This implanted what Hubbard termed "various misleading data"' (collectively termed the R6 [[implant (Scientology)|implant]]) into the memories of the hapless thetans, "which has to do with [[God]], the [[Devil]], [[Space opera in Scientology doctrine|space opera]], et cetera". This included all [[Major religious groups|world religions]], with Hubbard specifically attributing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and the image of the [[Crucifixion]] to the influence of Xenu. The [[interior decoration]] of "all modern theaters" is also said by Hubbard to be due to an unconscious recollection of Xenu's implants.{{Fact|plz add references to the quotes "...", if the para is synthesis of the book, give page nos|date=November 2008}}<!-- all preceding quotes seem to be from the Assists lecture--> The two "implant stations" cited by Hubbard were said to have been located on Hawaii and [[Las Palmas (province)|Las Palmas]] in the [[Canary Islands]].<ref name="corydon1987"></ref>

In addition to implanting new beliefs in the thetans, the images deprived them of their sense of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]]. When the thetans left the projection areas, they started to cluster together in groups of a few thousand, having lost the ability to differentiate between each other. Each cluster of thetans gathered into one of the few remaining bodies that survived the explosion. These became what are known as ''[[body thetan]]s'', which are said to be still clinging to and adversely affecting everyone except those Scientologists who have performed the necessary steps to remove them.

A government faction known as the Loyal Officers finally overthrew Xenu and his renegades, and locked him away in a mountain, where he was imprisoned forever by a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] powered by an eternal battery. Although the location of Xenu is sometimes said to be the [[Pyrenees]] on Earth, this is actually the location Hubbard gave elsewhere for an ancient "Martian report station."<ref>{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=Lafayette Ronald| authorlink=L.

The cost of learning these secrets from the Church of Scientology was 3,830 [[Pound sterling|British pounds]], or 6,500 US dollars, in 1988.<ref>{{cite news | last = Ricks| first = Mike| coauthors = Sarah Gorman| title = The 'Hard Sell' Cult

==Scientology doctrine==
Within Scientology, the Xenu story is referred to as "The Wall of Fire" or "Incident II". Hubbard attached tremendous importance to it, saying that it constituted "the secrets of a disaster which resulted in the decay of life as we know it in this sector of the galaxy".<ref>L. Ron Hubbard, ''Mission into Time'' (American Saint Hill Organization, 1973; current edition Bridge Publications ISBN 0-88404-023-2)</ref> The broad outlines of the story&mdash;that 75 million years ago a great catastrophe happened in this sector of the galaxy which caused profoundly negative effects for everyone since then&mdash;are publicly admitted to lower-level Scientologists. However, the details are kept strictly confidential, at least within the Church.

The OT III document describes how Hubbard entered the Wall of Fire but emerged alive, "probably the only one ever to do so in 75,000,000 years"<ref name="corydon1987"></ref>. He first publicly announced his "breakthrough" in ''Ron's Journal 67'' (''RJ67''), a tape Hubbard recorded on 20 September 1967 to be sent to all members of the Church. According to Hubbard, his research was achieved at the cost of a broken back, knee and arm. OT III contains a warning that the R6 implant is "calculated to kill (by pneumonia etc) anyone who attempts to solve it."<ref name="corydon1987"></ref><ref name="koff1988"></ref> In ''RJ67'',{{Verify source|date=November 2008}} Hubbard then alludes to the devastating effect of Xenu's genocide:
{{cquote|And it is very true that a great catastrophe occurred on this planet and in the other 75 planets which formed this [Galactic] Confederacy 75 million years ago. It has since that time been a desert, and it has been the lot of just a handful to try to push its technology up to a level where someone might adventure forward, penetrate the catastrophe, and undo it. We're well on our way to making this occur.}}

OT III also deals with ''Incident I'', set four [[quadrillion]]<ref>Four thousand billion in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]].</ref> years ago (or roughly 300,000 times longer than the current [[scientific consensus|scientifically accepted]] value for the [[age of the universe]]). In Incident I, the unsuspecting thetan was subjected to a loud snapping noise followed by a flood of luminescence, then saw a [[chariot]] followed by a trumpeting [[cherub]]. After a loud set of snaps, the thetan was overwhelmed by darkness. This is described as the implant offering the gateway to this universe, meaning that these traumatic memories are what separate thetans from their static (natural, godlike) state.

Hubbard uses the existence of body thetans to explain many of the physical and mental ailments of humanity which, he says, prevent people from achieving their highest spiritual levels. OT III tells the Scientologist to locate body thetans and release them from the effects of Incidents I and II by auditing them. This is accomplished in solo auditing, where the Scientologist holds both cans of an [[E-meter]] in one hand and asks questions as an auditor. The Scientologist is directed to find a cluster of body thetans, address it [[telepathy|telepathically]] as a cluster and take first the cluster then each individual member of the cluster through Incident II, then Incident I if needed. Hubbard warns that this is a painstaking procedure, and that OT levels IV to VII are necessary to continue the long process of dealing with one's body thetans.

The Church has objected to the Xenu story being used to paint Scientology as a mere [[science fiction]] fantasy.<ref name="Observer 2004">{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1217884,00.html| publisher=The Observer| title=Lure of the celebrity sect|date=16 May 2004|accessdate=2006-10-05| first=Jamie| last= Doward}}</ref> See: [[Space opera in Scientology doctrine]].

==Origins of the story==
Hubbard wrote OT III in late 1966 and early 1967 in [[North Africa]] while on his way to [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Las Palmas]] to join the ''Enchanter'', the first vessel of his private Scientology fleet (the "[[Sea Org]]").<ref>[[Russell Miller|Miller, Russell]], ''[http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfmconte.htm Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story Of L. Ron Hubbard]'' (Henry Holt, New York, 1988; ISBN 1-55013-027-7) p. 266</ref> (OT III says "In December 1967 I knew someone had to take the plunge", but the material was publicised well before this.) He emphasized later that OT III was his own personal discovery.

Critics of Scientology have suggested that other factors may have been at work. In a letter of the time to his wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard|Mary Sue]],<ref>Bent Corydon and L. Ron Hubbard Jr., ''[[L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?]]'' (Lyle Stuart, New Jersey, 1987; ISBN 0-8184-0444-2) pp58–59, 332–333; letter filed as evidence in ''Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong'', 1984, Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. C420153</ref> Hubbard said that, in order to assist his research, he was drinking alcohol and taking [[stimulant]]s and [[depressant]]s ("I'm drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and greys"). His assistant at the time, Virginia Downsborough, said that she had to wean him off the diet of drugs to which he had become accustomed.<ref>[[Jon Atack|Atack, Jon]], ''A Piece Of Blue Sky'' (Carol Publishing Group, New York, 1990; ISBN 0-8184-0499-X) part 4, ch. 1, "[http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/apobs/bs4-1.htm Scientology at Sea]" p.171</ref> Miller (p. 290) speculates that it was important for Hubbard to be found in a debilitated condition, so as to present OT III as "a research accomplishment of immense magnitude".

Elements of the Xenu story appeared in Scientology before OT III. Hubbard's descriptions of extraterrestrial conflicts were put forward as early as 1952 and were enthusiastically endorsed by Scientologists, who documented their [[Reincarnation|past lives]] on other planets (published in 1960 as ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]'').

==Influence of OT III on Scientology==
[[Image:LRonHubbard-Dianetics-ISBN1403105464-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|The volcano and fireball on the cover of ''Dianetics'' refers to the Xenu story.<ref name="savino">{{cite book| last =Savino| first =John| coauthors =Marie D.

Hubbard is reported to have ordered that Scientology books be reissued with cover imagery based on OT III.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.religio.de/atack/occ4.html#108| work=Hubbard and the Occult| title=References| accessdate=2006-10-05| first=Jon |last=Atack}}</ref> The 1968 and subsequent reprints of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'' have had covers depicting an exploding volcano. In a 1968 lecture, and in instructions to his marketing staff, Hubbard explained that these images would "key in" the submerged memories of Incident 1 and impel people to buy the books.<ref name="assists">L.

[[Image:Sea org.png|thumb|left|90px|The Sea Org logo]]
Since the 1980s, the volcano has also been depicted in [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] advertising ''Dianetics''.  Scientology's "[[Sea Org]]", an elite group within the church that originated with Hubbard's personal staff aboard his fleet of ships, takes many of its symbols from the story of Xenu and OT III. It is explicitly intended to be a revival of the "Loyal Officers" who overthrew Xenu. Its logo, a wreath with 26 leaves, represents the 26 stars of Xenu's Galactic Confederacy.<ref>Hubbard, "Ron's Talk to Pubs Org World Wide", tape of April 1968</ref> According to an official Scientology dictionary, "the Sea Org symbol, adopted and used as the symbol of a Galactic Confederacy far back in the history of this sector, derives much of its power and authority from that association."<ref>{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=Lafayette Ronald| coauthors=LRH Personal Secretary Office| title=Modern Management Technology Defined: Hubbard Dictionary of Administration and Management |year=1976 |isbn=0884040402|publisher=Church of Scientology of California|page=467}}</ref>

In the Advanced Orgs in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], Scientology staff were at one time ordered to wear all-white uniforms with silver boots, to mimic Xenu's Galactic Patrol as depicted on the cover of ''[[Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science]]''. This was reportedly done on the basis of Hubbard's declaration in his Flag Order 652 that mankind would accept regulation from that group which had last betrayed it &mdash; hence the imitation of Xenu's henchmen. (This was almost certainly a misinterpretation of what Hubbard meant &mdash; he was most likely referring to [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]]s, whom he believed had played a key role in Xenu's crimes.) In Los Angeles, a nightwatch was ordered to watch for returning spaceships.<ref>[[Jon Atack|Atack, Jon]], ''[http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/apobs/index.html A Piece Of Blue Sky]'' (Kensington Publishing Corporation, New York, 1990; ISBN 0-8184-0499-X) p. 190</ref> These measures were discarded after a time. 

A more lasting legacy of OT III was Scientology's [[organizational structure]]. The current "org board" is "a refined board of an old galactic civilization ''[the Galactic Confederacy]''. We applied Scientology to it and found why it eventually failed. It lacked a couple of departments and that was enough to mess it all up. They lasted 80 trillion<ref>Billion in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]]</ref> [years]."<ref>Hubbard, SHSBC 57, "Org Board and Livingness", 6 April 1965</ref>

=="Xenu" or "Xemu"?==
[[Image:Xenu-LRH-handwriting.png|frame|right|The manuscript of OT III contains the only known example of Xenu's name in Hubbard's handwriting.]]
The name has been spelled both as ''Xenu'' and ''Xemu''. The Class VIII course material includes a three-page text, handwritten by Hubbard, headed "Data", in which the Xenu story is given in detail. Hubbard's indistinct handwriting makes either spelling possible, particularly as the use of the name on the first page of OT III is the ''only'' known example of the name in his handwriting. In the "Assists" lecture, Hubbard speaks of ''"Xenu, ahhh, could be spelled X-E-M-U"'' and clearly says "Xemu" several times on the recording.<ref name="assists" /> The treatment of ''Revolt In The Stars'', which is typewritten (presumably by Hubbard), uses ''Xenu'' exclusively.

==Church of Scientology's position ==
In its public statements, the Church of Scientology has been notably reluctant to allow even a public mention of Xenu. A passing mention by a trial judge in 1997 prompted the Church's lawyers to have the ruling sealed, although this was reversed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Prendergast|first=Alan|work=Denver Westword |title=Nightmare on the net|date=6 March 1997| url=http://www.westword.com/1997-03-06/news/nightmare-on-the-net/ |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> In the relatively few instances in which it has acknowledged Xenu, the Church has stated the story is a religious writing that can be seen as the equivalent of the [[Old Testament]]—in which miraculous events are described that are unlikely to have occurred in real life, assuming true meaning only after years of study. They complain of critics using it to paint the religion as a science-fiction fantasy.<ref name="Observer 2004"/>

Senior members of the [[Church of Scientology]] have several times publicly denied or minimized the importance of the Xenu story, but others have admitted its existence. In a [[Scientology and Me|BBC ''Panorama'' program]] that aired on 14 May 2007, senior Scientologist Tommy Davis interrupted when celebrity members are asked about Xenu, saying: "None of us know what you're talking about. It's loony. It's weird." When John Carmichael, the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, was asked about the Xenu story in the 9 September 2007 edition of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', he said "That's not what we believe."<ref>{{cite web | title = Friends, thetans, countrymen| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/09/sm_scientology.xml&page=2| work = Seven| publisher = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''| page = 2| date = 2007-09-09| accessdate = 2007-09-22}}</ref> When asked directly about the Xenu story by [[Ted Koppel]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]] said that this was not a part of current or modern Scientology.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2664713&page=1|date=14 February 1992|title=ABC News, Nightline: A Conversation with David Miscavige"|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>  However, in a 2006 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Mike Rinder]], the director of the church's [[Office of Special Affairs]], said that "It is not a ''story'', it is an auditing level," when asked about the validity of the Xenu story.<ref name="Inside">{{cite web | first = Janet| last = Reitman | title = Inside Scientology| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/9363363/inside_scientology/print| publisher = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 2006-02-23| accessdate = 2007-09-22}}</ref>

Church lawyer Warren McShane said in a 1995 court case that the story had ''never'' been secret, although maintaining there were nevertheless [[trade secret]]s contained in OT III. Notably, McShane discussed the details of the story at some length and specifically attributed the authorship of the story to Hubbard.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII/mcshane-rj67.txt| title=Re: Ron's Journal 67| work=alt.religion.scientology| accessdate=2006-10-05| date=28 August 1998| first=Mike | last=O'Connor| id=lepton-2808981630510001@lepton.dialup.access.net| format=TXT}} (testimony under oath by Warren McShane of the Church of Scientology in RTC v.

Scientology has many graduated levels through which one can progress. Many who remain at lower levels in the church are unaware of much of the space-opera doctrines, which mostly begin at [[Operating Thetan]] level three, or "OT III".<ref name="corydon1987" /><ref name="APOBS">[[Jon Atack|Atack, Jon]], ''[http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/apobs/index.html A Piece Of Blue Sky]'' (Kensington Publishing Corporation, New York, 1990; ISBN 0-8184-0499-X)</ref> Because the information imparted to members is to be kept secret from others who have not attained that level, the member must publicly deny its existence when asked.

==Leaking of the story==
Despite the Church's efforts to keep the story secret, details have been leaked over the years. OT III was first revealed in Robert Kaufman's 1972 book ''[[Inside Scientology]]'', in which Kaufman detailed his own experiences of OT III.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaufman |first=Robert|title=Inside Scientology: How I Joined Scientology and Became Superhuman |publisher=Olympia Press|date=1972|isbn=0700401105}}</ref> It was later described in a 1981 Clearwater ''Sun'' article<ref>{{cite journal| last =Leiby

On 24 December 1994, the Xenu story was published on the Internet for the first time in a posting to the [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] [[alt.religion.scientology]], through an [[anonymous remailer]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Skeptic|last=Lippard|first=Jim|url=http://www.discord.org/~lippard/skeptic/03.3.jl-jj-scientology.html |title=Scientology v. the Internet: Free Speech & Copyright Infringement on the Information Super-Highway |accessdate=2008-11-29|volume=3|issue=3|year=1995|pages=35-41}}</ref> This led to an [[Scientology versus the Internet|online battle between Church of Scientology lawyers and detractors]]. Older versions of OT levels I to VII were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by [[Steven Fishman]] on 9 April 1993 as part of ''Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz''. The text of this declaration and its exhibits, collectively known as the [[Fishman Affidavit]], were posted to the Internet newsgroup [[alt.religion.scientology]] in [[1995|August 1995]] by [[Arnaldo Lerma|Arnie Lerma]] and on the [[World Wide Web]] by [[David S. Touretzky]]. This was a subject of great controversy and legal battles for several years, notably a [[copyright]] raid on Lerma's house (leading to massive [[Mirror (computing)|mirroring]] of the documents)<ref>{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Wendy| title=Scientologists Fight On |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 August 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Brown|title=Let's All Beam Up To Heaven|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 May 1996|pages=17|quote=The group responded with a campaign of raids and seizures around the US, claiming that these documents were copyrighted trade secrets.

The Church's attempts to keep Xenu under wraps have been cited in court findings against it. In September 2003, a Dutch court, in a ruling in the case against Karin Spaink, stated that one objective in keeping OT II and OT III secret was to wield power over members of the Church and prevent discussion about the Church's teachings and practices:<ref>''"Uit de hiervoor onder 8.3 vermelde teksten blijkt dat Scientology c.s. met hun leer en organisatie de verwerping van democratische waarden niet schuwen. Uit die teksten volgt tevens dat met de geheimhouding van OT II en OT III mede wordt beoogd macht uit te oefenen over leden van de Scientology-organisatie en discussie over de leer en praktijken van de Scientology-organisatie te verhinderen."''[http://www.rechtspraak.nl/ljn.asp?ljn=AI5638]</br>Translation: "The texts previously quoted show that in its teachings and its structure, Scientology c.s. do not shun the rejection of democratic values. From these texts it is also apparent that one of the objectives of keeping OT II and OT III secret is to wield power over members of the Scientology organization and to prevent discussion about the teachings and practices of the Scientology organization."</ref>

Despite his claims that premature revelation of the OT III story was lethal, L. Ron Hubbard wrote a screenplay version under the title ''[[Revolt in the Stars]]'' in the 1970s.<ref name="OxfordHandbook">{{cite book|last= Grünschloß |first= Andreas |year=2004 |chapter= Waiting for the "Big Beam," UFO Religions and "UFOlogical" Themes in New Religious Movements|pages= 427-8 |editor=James R.

On the 10th March 2001, a user posted the text of OT3 to the online community [[Slashdot]]. The site owners took down the comment after the Church of Scientology made a legal threat under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].<ref>{{cite news

Critics of the Church of Scientology have used public protests to spread the Xenu secret. This has included handing out summaries of the story to the public<ref>{{cite web | last = Gerard  | first = David

Geoffrey Filbert, a [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] (non-CoS) Scientologist, wrote a book, ''Excalibur Revisited'', in 1982, containing his own version of OT III. This was the first of several versions available in the Free Zone.

==In popular culture==

A number of television shows have featured visual depictions of Xenu, either as a cartoon or a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] character. Hubbard did not describe the physical form of Xenu in the OT III documents and provided no illustrations of him; portrayals of Xenu have therefore varied considerably. [[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'s animated presentation of the OT III story showed Xenu, spaceships carrying captured aliens to Earth and the bombing of the volcanoes. Xenu is depicted as a bald, bearded warlord in a militaristic uniform.<ref name="panorama1987" />

The satirical musical [[A Very Merry Unauthorised Children's Scientology Pageant]] includes the song "The Way That It Began" in which children in alien costumes tell the story of Xenu.<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney |work=Variety|date=10 December 2006|title=Theatre Review: A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932286.html?categoryid=33&cs=1|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref><!-- commons picture at http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:2007_A_Very_Merry_Xenu.jpg-->

===South Park===
{{Main|Trapped in the Closet (South Park)}}
[[Image:South Park Xenu.jpg|thumb|right|Xenu as depicted in ''[[South Park]]'']]
In November 2005, "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]", an episode of the [[animated]] [[television series]] ''[[South Park]]'', [[satire|satirized]] Scientology, including an animated retelling of the Xenu story, with the words "THIS IS WHAT SCIENTOLOGISTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE" superimposed on-screen for most of it. Xenu is depicted as a vaguely humanoid alien with tentacles for arms. In the ''South Park'' episode, the aliens are directly dropped into the volcanoes, and the thetans rise in an effort to return but are then captured. 

The episode became the subject of a controversy when its rebroadcast by [[Comedy Central]] was dropped, with another episode being substituted. The channel stated that the substitution was intended to pay tribute to [[Isaac Hayes]]. The creators of ''[[South Park]],'' [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]], disagreed and asserted that Comedy Central's owners [[Viacom]] had replaced the episode because the Church of Scientology intervened (or interfered) and, more specifically, because Tom Cruise (who was himself lampooned in the episode) threatened distributor Paramount (also a Viacom property) with refusal to cooperate with the promotional campaign on the upcoming film ''[[Mission Impossible 3]]''. Cruise's representative denied this, but Parker and Stone issued a satirical press release that was published in the entertainment newspaper, ''[[Daily Variety]]'':<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526757/20060321/index.jhtml?headlines=true&rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler| title=South Park' Cooks Up Plan For Chef In Season Premiere| date=2006-03-21| publisher=MTV News| accessdate=2006-10-05}}</ref>

:"So, Scientology, you may have won THIS battle, but the million-year war for Earth has just begun! Temporarily anozinizing our episode will NOT stop us from keeping Thetans forever trapped in your pitiful man-bodies. Curses and drat! You have obstructed us for now, but your feeble bid to save humanity will fail! HAIL XENU!!!"

Comedy Central did eventually rebroadcast the episode on 19 July 2006.

===Nip/Tuck===
Xenu appeared in "[[Willy Ward]]", the penultimate episode of season 4 of the [[FX (TV network)|FX]] show ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' (first broadcast 5 December 2006). In a dream sequence, Scientologist character [[Kimber Henry]] ([[Kelly Carlson]]) has a vision of Xenu while experiencing hallucinations and doubts about Scientology. Xenu is depicted as a cross between [[Ming the Merciless]] and a stereotypical [[greys|grey alien]].<ref>"Looking for a change, 'Nip/Tuck' heads west", ''Arizona Republic'', 16 December 2006<br>..Christian and Dawn Budge's (O'Donnell) sexual tryst, sexy Kimber's faceoff with the Scientology figure Xenu..</ref><ref>"TELEVISION; `Nip/Tuck' warms up to Scientology; The FX drama", ''Los Angeles Times'', 1 October 2006<br>...that most human problems can be traced to lingering spirits of an extraterrestrial people massacred By their ruler, Xenu, over 75 million years ago..</ref>
