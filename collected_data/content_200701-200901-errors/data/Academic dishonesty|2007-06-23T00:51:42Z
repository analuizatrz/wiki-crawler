'''Academic dishonesty''' or '''academic misconduct''' is any type of [[cheating]] that occurs in relation to a formal [[academic]] exercise.  It can include:

*[[Academic dishonesty#Plagiarism|Plagiarism]] - The adoption or reproduction of ideas or words or statements of another person without due acknowledgment. 
*[[Academic dishonesty#Self Plagiarism|Self Plagiarism]] - The submission of the same work for academic credit more than once without permission. 
*[[Academic dishonesty#Fabrication|Fabrication]] - The falsification of data, information, or [[citations]] in any formal academic exercise.
*[[Academic dishonesty#Deception|Deception]] - Providing false information to an instructor concerning a formal academic exercise, e.g. giving a false excuse for missing a deadline or falsely claiming to have submitted work.
*[[Academic dishonesty#Cheating|Cheating]] - Any attempt to give or obtain assistance in a formal academic exercise without due acknowledgment.
*[[Academic dishonesty#Sabotage|Sabotage]] - Acting to prevent others from completing their work.  This includes cutting pages out of library books or willfully disrupting the experiments of others.

Academic dishonesty has been documented in most every type of educational setting, from elementary school to graduate school, and has been met with varying degrees of approbation throughout history.  Today, educated society tends to take a very negative view of academic dishonesty.

==History of Academic Dishonesty==
Academic dishonesty dates back to the first tests.  Scholars note that cheating was prevalent on the [[Chinese civil service]] exams thousands of years ago, even when cheating carried the penalty of death for both examinee and examiner.<ref>Ann Bushway and William R. Nash, "School Cheating Behavior," ''Review of Educational Research'' 47, no. 4 (Autumn 1977), 623.</ref>  Before the founding of the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] at end of the 19th century, there were no set rules on how to cite properly borrowings from others' writings, which may have caused many cases of [[plagiarism]] out of ignorance."<ref>Sue Carter Simmons, "Competing Notions of Authorship: A Historical Look at Students and Textbooks on Plagiarism and Cheating," in ''Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in the Postmodern World'' ed. Lise Buranen and Alice M. Roy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1999), 42.</ref>.  

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, cheating was widespread at college campuses in the United States, and was not considered dishonorable among students.<ref>Ibid., 45</ref>  It has been estimated that as many as two-thirds of students cheated at some point of their college careers at the turn of the century.  [[Sorority|Fraternities]] often operated so-called [[Essay mill]]s, where term papers were kept on file and could be resubmitted over and over again by different students, often with the only change being the name on the paper.  At that time, college students, usually white privileged men, were expected by their parents and by society to live the life of the young gentleman, and were required to fulfill a number of social obligations (make connections with the future elite, find a suitable mate, become independent) that were considered far more important than grades.  Accordingly, cheating was commonly used by students to put more time towards fulfilling their social obligations at the expense of their academic ones.  As higher education in the U.S. trended towards [[meritocracy]], however, a greater emphasis was put on anti-cheating policies, and the newly diverse student bodies tended to arrive with a more negative view of academic dishonesty.

==Academic dishonesty today==
Academic dishonesty is endemic in all levels of education.  In the United States, studies show that 20% of students started cheating in the first grade<ref>Bushway and Nash, 623.</ref>  Similarly, other studies reveal that currently in the U.S., 56% of [[middle school]] students and 70% of [[high school]] students have cheated.<ref>Wilfried Decoo, ''Crisis on Campus: Confronting Academic Misconduct'' (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2002), 23.</ref>  

The first scholarly studies in the 1960s of academic dishonesty in [[higher education]] found that nationally in the U.S., somewhere between 50%-70% of college students had cheated at least once.<ref>William J. Bowers, ''Student Dishonesty and its Control in Colleges'' (New York: Bureau of Applied Social Research, Columbia University, 1964), 155.</ref>  While nationally, these rates of cheating in the U.S. remain stable today, there are large disparities between different schools, depending on the size, selectivity, and anti-cheating policies of the school.  Generally, the smaller and more selective the college, the less cheating occurs there.  For instance, the number of students who have engaged in academic dishonesty at small elite [[liberal arts colleges]] can be as low as 15%-20%, while cheating at large [[public university|public universities]] can be as high as 75%.<ref>Emily E. LaBeff, et al., "Situational Ethics and College Student Cheating," ''Sociological Inquiry'' 60, no. 2 (May 1990), 192.</ref>  Moreover, researchers have found that students who attend a school with an [[honor code]] are less likely to cheat than students at schools with other ways of enforcing academic integrity.<ref>Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, "Academic Dishonesty: Honor Codes and Other Contextual Influences," ''The Journal of Higher Education'' 64, no. 5, (September-October 1993), 532.</ref> 

While research on academic dishonesty in other countries is minimal, anecdotal evidence suggests cheating could be even more common in countries like Japan.<ref>L.M. Dryden, "A Distant Mirror or Through the Looking Glass?: Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in Japanese Education," in ''Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in the Postmodern World,'' ed. Lise Buranen and Alice M. Roy (Albany: SUNY Press, 1999), 75.</ref>

==Plagiarism==
{{see|Plagiarism}}

Plagiarism is the adoption or reproduction of the ideas or words or statements of another person without due acknowledgment.  This can range from borrowing without [[attribution]] a particularly apt phrase, to paraphrasing someone else's original idea without citation, to wholesale [[contract cheating]].  When plagiarizing, students will often turn to the [[Internet]], due the ease of [[copying and pasting]] from websites such as [[Wikipedia]]. Other more old fashioned forms of plagiarism such as [[essay mill|paper mills]] and passing off obscure articles or chapters of books of others as original work also still occur.  Plagiarized papers are often riddled with gross inconsistencies such as referencing non-existent sections of the essay, changes in spelling and grammar customs, or the argument changing in mid-paragraph.

==Self Plagiarism==
Self plagiarism is the submission of the same work for academic credit more than once without permission. For instance, submitting the same paper to two different courses is an example of self plagiarism. The practice is sometimes acceptable if permission is sought ahead of time.

==Fabrication==
Fabrication is the falsification of data, information, or citations in any formal academic exercise.  This includes making up citations to back up arguments or inventing quotations.  Fabrication predominates in the natural sciences, where students sometimes fudge numbers to make experiments "work".  It includes data falsification, in which false claims are made about research performed, including selective submitting of results to exclude inconvenient data to generating bogus data.

==Deception==
Deception is providing false information to a teacher/instructor concerning a formal academic exercise.  Examples of this include taking more time on a take-home test than is allowed, giving a dishonest excuse when asking for a deadline extension, or falsely claiming to have submitted work.  This type of academic misconduct is often considered softer than the more obvious forms of cheating, and otherwise honest students sometimes engage in this type of dishonesty without considering themselves cheaters. It is also sometimes done by students who have failed to complete an assignment to avoid detection for doing so.

==Sabotage==
Sabotage is when a student prevents others from completing their work.  This includes cutting pages out of library books or willfully disrupting the experiments of others.  Sabotage is usually only found in highly [[competition|competitive]], cutthroat environments, such as at extremely elite schools where class rankings are highly prized.

==Cheating==
{{see|Cheating}}
Cheating is any attempt to give or obtain assistance in a formal academic exercise without due acknowledgment.  Cheating can take the form of [[Cheat sheet|crib notes]], looking over someone's shoulder during an exam, or any forbidden sharing of information between students regarding an exam or exercise.  Many elaborate methods of cheating have been developed over the years.  For instance, students have been documented hiding notes in the bathroom toilet tank, in the brims of their baseball caps, or up their sleeves.  Also, the storing of information in graphing calculators, pagers, cell phones, and other electronic devices has cropped up since the information revolution began.  While students have long surreptitiously scanned the tests of those seated near them, some students actively try to aid those who are trying to cheat.  Methods of secretly signaling the right answer to friends are quite varied, ranging from coded sneezes or pencil tapping to high pitched noises beyond the hearing range of most teachers.
Cheating differs from most other forms of academic dishonesty, in that people can engage in it without benefiting themselves at all.  For example, a student who illicitly [[telegraphed]] answers to a friend during a test would be cheating, even though the student's own work is in no way affected.

==Causes of academic dishonesty==
There are a variety of causes of academic misconduct.  Researchers have studied the correlation of cheating to personal characteristics, demographics, contextual factors, methods of deterring misconduct, even [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].

===Demographic and personal causes===
Extensive studies have found that no personal characteristics correlate well with cheating, that is, there are no people "born to cheat".<ref>Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, "Individual and Contextual Influences on Academic Dishonesty: A Multicampus Investigation," ''Research in Higher Education'' 38, no. 2, (1997), 380.</ref>  Indeed, one experiment found that there was no relationship between how a student performed on a [[Defining Issues Test|morality test]] and his likelihood of cheating (that is, students at a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development#Pre-Conventional|pre-conventional]] stage of morality are as likely to cheat as those at a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development#Post-Conventional|post-conventional]] stage).<ref>Tim West, Sue Ravenscroft, and Charles Shrader, "Cheating and Moral Judgment in the College Classroom: A Natural Experiment," ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 54, no. 2, (Oct. 2004), 181.</ref>

Demographic variables are also generally not strongly correlated with cheating, with a few minor exceptions.  It has been found that younger students are somewhat more likely to cheat: one study finding the highest incidence of cheating occurs during Sophomore year at college.<ref>Kenneth J. Smith, Jeanette A. Davy, and Debbie Easterling, "An Examination of Cheating and its Antecedents Among Marketing and Management Majors," ''The Journal of Business Ethics'' 50, no. 1, (March 2004), 66.</ref> Also, while it was found that men cheated slightly more often than women in the 1960s, that gap has disappeared in recent years.<ref>McCabe and Trevino, "Multicampus Investigation," 380</ref>  Another demographic variable that affects cheating behavior is academic achievement, in that students who perform poorly tend to cheat more than students who perform well.<ref>Ibid</ref>.  For instance, low grades and low [[SAT]] scores have a [[correlation]] with high levels of cheating.<ref>Jude Carroll, ''A Handbook for Deterring Plagiarism in Higher Education'' (Oxford: The Oxford Centre for Staff and Learning Development, 2002), 18.</ref>  In addition,  parental education shows a weak but positive correlation with cheating; students whose parents received college degrees are slightly more likely to cheat than are students whose parents did not attend college.<ref>Ibid</ref>. Generally though, [[race]], [[nationality]], and [[social class|class]] all show little correlation with academic misconduct. There is also no correlation between how religious someone is and the likelihood that that person will cheat.  A comparison between students of different [[religions]] yielded similar results, although the study did show that [[Jews]] tend to cheat less than members of other religions (since the study was done in the early 60s, it is possible that Jews were benefiting from the above-mentioned relationship between cheating and parental college education).<ref>Bowers, 207</ref>.  One of the strongest demographic correlations with academic misconduct in the United States is with language. Students who speak [[English language|English]] as a second language have been shown to commit academic dishonesty more and are more likely to be caught than native speakers, since they will often not want to rewrite sources in their own words, fearing that the meaning of the sentence will be lost through poor paraphrasing skills.<ref>Carroll, 21.</ref>  Probably for this reason, in the [[University of California]] system, while [[international students]] make up 10% of the student body they comprise 47% of academic dishonesty cases.<ref>Decoo, 25.</ref>

===Contextual causes===
Academic misconduct is more easily traced to the academic and social environment of the student than to his or her background.  These contextual factors can be as broad as the social milieu at school to as narrow as what instructions a teacher gives before an exam.

Contextual factors that individual teachers can affect often makes the least difference on cheating behavior.  A study found that increasing the distance between students taking an exam has little effect on academic misconduct, and that threatening students before an exam with expulsion if they cheat actually promotes cheating behavior.<ref>Joe Kerkvliet and Charles L. Sigmund, "Can We Control Cheating in the Classroom?," ''The Journal of Economic Education'' 30, no. 4, (Autumn, 1999), 331.</ref>  Indeed, increased exam [[proctor|proctoring]] and other methods of detecting cheating in the classroom are largely ineffective.  According to one survey of American college students, while 50% had cheated at least once in the previous six months, and 7% had cheated more than five times in that period, only 2.5% of the cheaters had been caught.<ref>Labeff, et al., 192.</ref> As teachers invent more elaborate methods of deterring cheating, students invent even more elaborate methods of cheating (sometimes even treating it as a game), leading to what some teachers call a costly and unwinnable [[arms race]].<ref>Carrol, 61.</ref>  Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior.  It has been found that students with markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat, probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered.<ref>Douglas N. Bunn, Steven B. Caudill, and Daniel M. Gropper, "Crime in the Classroom: An Economic Analysis of Undergraduate Student Cheating Behavior," ''The Journal of Economic Education'' 23, no. 3, (Summer 1992), 205.</ref> However, if a professor makes clear that he disapproves of cheating, either in the syllabus, in the first class, or at the beginning of a test, academic dishonesty can drop by 12%.<ref>Kerkvliet and Sigmund, 331.</ref>  

Teachers can, however, accidentally promote cheating behavior.  A study found a correlation between how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating as a way of getting back at the teacher.<ref>Bushway and Nash, 628.</ref> Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as when the teacher is using a [[grade curve]], are more likely to cheat.<ref>Bernard E. Whitley, "Factors Associated with Cheating Among College Students: A Review," ''Research in Higher Education'' 39, no. 3, (June, 1998), 252.</ref>

The most important contextual causes of academic misconduct are often out of individual teachers' hands.  One very important factor is [[time management]]. One survey reported two-thirds of teachers believed that poor time management was the principal cause of cheating.<ref>Carroll, 18.</ref>  Often social engagements are to blame.  It has been found that there is a strong correlation between [[extracurricular activities]] and cheating, especially among athletes, even those on intramural teams.<ref>McCabe and Trevino, "Multicampus Investigation," 382.</ref>  It has also been found that student cheating rates rise significantly the more time students spend [[playing cards]], watching [[television]], or having a few drinks with friends.<ref>Bowers, 104.</ref>  Relatedly, [[fraternity]] or [[sorority]] membership is also strongly correlated with academic misconduct.<ref>McCabe and Trevino, "Multicampus Investigation," 383.</ref>   

One of the most important causes of academic misconduct is the contextual factor of an environment of peer disapproval of cheating, that is, [[peer pressure]].  Psychologists note that all people tend to follow the [[Norm_%28sociology%29|norms]] of their [[peer group]], which would include norms about academic dishonesty.<ref>F. Clark Power, Ann Higgins, and Lawrence Kohlberg, ''Lawrence Kohlberg's Approach to Moral Education'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1989), 214.</ref>  Thus, students who believe that their peers disapprove of cheating are less likely to cheat.  Indeed, multiple studies show that the most decisive factor in a student's decision to cheat is his perception of his peers' relationship with academic dishonesty.<ref>McCabe and Trevino, "Honor Codes and Other Contextual Influences," 532.</ref>  For instance, on average 69% of students cheat at colleges with low community disapproval of academic misconduct, whereas only about 23% of students cheat at colleges with strong community disapproval of academic misconduct.<ref>Bowers, 155.</ref>  Peer pressure works both ways, as a study found that there is a 41% increase in the probability of a student cheating if she has seen someone else cheat.<ref>Bunn, Caudill, and Gropper, 204.</ref>  However, even if most students strongly disapprove of cheating, there has to be a community in order for those norms to be enforced via peer pressure.  For instance, larger schools, which usually have much higher cheating rates than small schools, tend to have a weaker community, being more split up into different peer groups that exert little social pressure on each other.<ref>Bowers, 199.</ref>  Another measure of a college community, how many students live on campus, further shows a significant relation with a school's cheating rate.<ref>Bowers, 169.</ref>  Relatedly, many professors argue that smaller classes reduce cheating behavior.<ref>Donald L. McCabe, Linda Klebe Trevino, and Donald L. Butterfield, "Honor Code and Other Contextual Influences on Academic Integrity: A Replication and Extension to Modified Honor Code Settings" ''Research in Higher Education'' 43, no. 3, (June 2002), 368.</ref>

===Ethical causes===
No matter what the demographic or contextual influences are on a student who decides to engage in cheating behavior, before she can cheat she must overcome her own [[conscience]].  This depends both on how strongly someone disapproves of academic dishonesty and what types of justifications the student uses to escape a sense of guilt.  For instance, students who personally do not have a moral problem with academic misconduct can cheat [[guilt]]-free.  However, while many students have been taught and have internalized that academic dishonesty is wrong, it has been shown that on average a third of students who strongly disapprove of cheating have in fact cheated.<ref>Bowers, 72.</ref>  People who cheat despite personal disapproval of cheating engage in something called "neutralization," in which a student rationalizes the cheating as being acceptable due to certain mitigating circumstances.<ref>Richard A. Bernardi, Rene L. Metzger, Ryann G. Scofield Bruno, Marisa A. Wade Hoogkamp, Lillian E. Reyes, and Gary H. Barnaby, "Examining the Decision Process of Students' Cheating Behavior: An Empirical Study" ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 50, no. 1, (2004), 399.</ref> According to psychologists of deviant behavior, people who engage in neutralization support the societal norm in question, but "conjure up" reasons why they are allowed to violate that norm in a particular case.<ref>Kenneth J. Smith, Jeanette A. Davy, and Debbie Easterling, "An Examination of Cheating and its Antecedents Among Marketing and Management Majors," ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 50, no. 1, (March 2004), 66.</ref>  Neutralization is not a simple case of ''ex post facto'' rationalization, but is rather a more comprehensive affair, occurring before, during, and after the act of cheating.<ref>LaBeff, et al., 191.</ref>  Researchers have found four major types of neutralization of academic dishonesty, which they categorize by type of justification.  ''Denial of responsibility'', that is, the accusation that others are to blame or that something forced the student to cheat, is the most common form of neutralization among college students who cheated, with 61% of cheaters using this form of justification.<ref>Donald L. McCabe, "The Influence of Situational Ethics on Cheating Among College Students," ''Sociological Inquiry'' 62, no. 3, (August 1992), 368.</ref>  ''Condemnation of condemner'', that is, that the professors are hypocrites or brought it on themselves, is the second most common form of college student neutralization at 28%.<ref>Ibid.</ref>  The third most popular form of neutralization among college students is the ''appeal to higher loyalties,'' where the student thinks her responsibility to some other entity, usually her peers, is more important than doing what she knows to be morally right.  About 6.8% of cheaters in higher education use this form of neutralization.<ref>Ibid.</ref> ''Denial of injury'' - that nobody is worse off for the cheating - is the fourth most popular kind of neutralization at 4.2% of cheaters.<ref>Ibid.</ref>  
 
==Effects of academic dishonesty==
Cheating in academia has a host of effects on students and on the educational system itself. For instance, students who engage in neutralization to justify cheating, even once, are more likely to engage in cheating in the future, potentially putting them on a road to a life of dishonesty.<ref>Smith, Davy, and Easterling, 66.</ref>   
Punishments for academic dishonesty vary according to the age of the party involved and the nature of the infraction. In [[high school]], a standard penalty for cheating is a failing grade; in [[college]], it can result in expulsion.  In rare instances, college professors have been [[termination of employment|fired]] when it was discovered that they plagiarized during [[college]] or [[graduate school]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  All parties involved in the dishonesty&mdash;not just the individual whose grade is increased by it&mdash;can be punished. 

Several notable U.S. colleges have strict [[honor codes]] with penalties that include suspension or even expulsion.  For example, [[Duke University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[Dartmouth College]] have honor codes which specifically state that any student caught lying, cheating, or stealing will be asked to leave the University.

The scientific [[peer review]] process places considerable reliance on the moral integrity of the participants, and therefore academic dishonesty often goes unnoticed. If found out, however, the penalties can be severe -- it can be the end of the perpetrator's career.

==Historical examples==

In 2002, the student-run Honor Committee of the [[University of Virginia]] concluded a 20-month investigation in which 157 were investigated for plagiarism. The result was 48 students were either convicted or admitted guilt. The school has a zero-tolerance policy, and the 48 students were either expelled or left voluntarily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/EDUCATION/11/26/uva.plagiarism.ap/ U.Va. plagiarism scandal ends with 45 dismissals|title=University of Virginia=[[CNN Archives]]|accessdate=2007-6-6 }}</ref>

A 1991 investigation by Boston University found that Civil Rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] plagiarized a significant portion of his doctoral dissertation without proper citation. The committee found that there was no conclusive evidence that King had acted intentionally, and announced that the dissertation still "makes an important contribution to scholarship." A letter was attached to King's dissertation noting the descrepancies, but his Ph. D was not revoked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/mlking.asp|title=Martin Luther King|work=[[Urban Legends Reference Pages|Snopes]]|accessdate=2007-01-15 }}</ref>
