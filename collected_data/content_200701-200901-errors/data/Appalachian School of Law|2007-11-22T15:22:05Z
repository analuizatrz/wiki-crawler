The '''Appalachian School of Law''' (ASL) is a fully-accredited private [[law school]] on a four building campus in [[Grundy, Virginia]], a small town near the convergence of [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[West Virginia]]. The school offers a three-year [[Juris Doctor]] degree, and enrolls approximately 370 full-time students.<ref name="Appalachian School of Law - Student Body">{{cite web

ASL was started and brought to [[Buchanan County, Virginia]] as a tool of economic development for the region. The school is fully accredited by the [[American Bar Association]]. ASL is notable for its focus to community service and leadership, emphasizing [[professional responsibility]] and [[alternative dispute resolution]] in its curriculum and requiring students to complete 25 hours of community service per semester in order to graduate. Each student is also required to complete an externship before graduation. ASL was also the site of a [[Appalachian School of Law shooting|triple homicide]] that took place on [[January 16]], [[2002]]. 

==History==
[[Image:AtriumASL.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Atrium at ASL, circa 2002.]]
ASL traces its roots back to [[1993]] when [[Norton, Virginia]] lawyer Joe Wolfe came up with the idea to create a law school in Central [[Appalachia]].  His idea was well received by local business leaders and a steering committee was founded in [[1994]] and grew to eighty members. The committee surveyed lawyers and found that legal education needed to emphasize [[professional responsibility]] and [[alternative dispute resolution]] as these pillars of law school were becoming more important in today's law practice. The committee gained permission of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] to start a law school in [[1995]] and continued to secure endorsements from local civic associations and industrial development authorities.  [[Buchanan County, Virginia]] approached the committee in [[1996]] and offered the grounds and buildings of the former Grundy Elementary and Intermediate Schools to which the steering committee accepted.<ref name="ASL Course Catalog">{{cite web

[[Buchanan County, Virginia|Buchanan County]] brought ASL to [[Grundy, Virginia|Grundy]] in order to revitalize a town that had been in a steady economic decline since the town's Flood of 1977. ASL has brought a positive economic impact on its home town, including spurring construction of rental homes and the opening of additional businesses in the area.

On [[January 16]], [[2002]], ASL Dean Anthony Sutin, Professor Thomas Blackwell, and 1L student Angela Dales were shot and killed by disgruntled student Peter Odighizuwa, 43, of [[Nigeria]].  When Odighizuwa exited the building, he was subdued by two students armed with personal firearms.
