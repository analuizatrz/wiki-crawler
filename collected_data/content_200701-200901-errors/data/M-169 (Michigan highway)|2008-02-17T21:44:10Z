'''M-169''' was a [[Michigan Highway System|state highway route]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] that served as a connector route between [[U.S. Route 27|US 27]] and [[M-55 (Michigan highway)|M-55]] near [[Houghton Lake, Michigan|Houghton Lake]] in [[Roscommon County, Michigan|Roscommon County]].<ref name="bessert1">{{cite web | author= Bessert, Christopher J. | title=Michigan Highways: Master List 1918-Present | date=[[2006-10-22]] | work=Michigan Highways | url= http://www.michiganhighways.org/master_list.html#routes160-179 | accessdate=2006-11-18 }}</ref> At the time, US 27 traveled around [[Houghton Lake (Michigan)|Houghton Lake]] to the east. M-169 was replaced by M-55 when the route of M-55 through [[Houghton Lake Heights, Michigan|Houghton Lake Heights]] was designated as [[M-55 Business (Houghton Lake Heights)|BUS M-55]]. The former M-169 later became a part of US 27 (now OLD US 27) when US 27 was rerouted on a western bypass of Houghton Lake.
