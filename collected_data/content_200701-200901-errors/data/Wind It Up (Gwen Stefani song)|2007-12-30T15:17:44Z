"'''Wind It Up'''" is a [[pop rap]] song written by [[Gwen Stefani]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] originally for inclusion on Stefani's [[Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005]].  Because of favorable reception, the song was later recorded for her second solo album ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006).  The track includes an [[interpolation (music)|interpolation]] of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' song "[[The Lonely Goatherd]]".

"Wind It Up" was panned by music critics, who criticized the song's use of [[yodeling]] and found the track to be over the top.  The track was released as the album's [[lead single]] in late 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]) and reached the top twenty in most music markets.

==Critical reception==
"Wind It Up" received generally negative reviews by contemporary pop music critics.  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' found the bassline "rubbery" and criticized the song for lacking a melody as well as its reference to Stefani's own clothing line.<ref name="ew"/>  [[All Music Guide]] said that [[The Neptunes]] had forced the sampling "into one of their typical minimalist tracks, over which Gwen spouts off clumsy material-minded lyrics touting her fashion line and her shape".<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]].

Many criticized the inclusion of yodeling and "The Lonely Goatherd" sample.  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the track "yodel-trocious" and commented that "the problem isn't the [[Swiss Miss]] motif so much as the fourth-rate Neptunes track and the [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]-imitating vocal", adding that Fergie's "[[London Bridge (Fergie song)|London Bridge]]" had been successful by mimicking Stefani's "[[Hollaback Girl]]".<ref>Sheffield, Rob.

In the face of criticism, Stefani has defended the track:
