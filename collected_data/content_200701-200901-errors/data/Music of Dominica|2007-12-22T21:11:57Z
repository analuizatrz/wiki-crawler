The '''music of Dominica''' plays an important role in the social and culture life of the [[Antillean]] island of [[Dominica]].  [[Popular music]] is widespread, with a number of native Dominican performers gaining national fame in imported genres like [[calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae]], [[soca music|soca]], [[zouk]] and [[rock and roll]].  In addition, Dominica's own popular music industry has created a form called ''[[bouyon music|bouyon]]'', which combines elements from several styles and has achieved a wide fanbase in Dominica, especially the group ''WCK'' ([[Windward Caribbean Kulture]]). Native musicians in various forms, like reggae ([[Nasio Fontaine]],[[Lazo (musician)|Lazo]]), [[Brother Matthew Luke]]), soca ([[Derick St. Rose-De Hunter]], [[Young Bull]]), zouk ([[Ophelia Marie]]), Cadence-Lypso ([[Exile One]]),([[Grammacks]]) and calypso ([[The Wizzard]]), [[Levi "Super L" Loblack]], have also become stars at home and abroad.

Like the other [[music of the Lesser Antilles|Francophone musics of the Lesser Antilles]], Dominican folk music is a hybrid of African and European elements.  The [[quadrille]] is an important symbol of French Antillean culture, and is, on Dominica, typically accompanied by a kind of ensemble called a ''[[jing ping]]'' band.  In addition, Dominica's folk tradition includes folk songs called ''[[bélé]]'', traditional [[storytelling]] called ''[[kont]]'', [[masquerade]], [[children's music|children's]] and [[work song]]s, and [[Carnival]] music.

Until the late 1950s, the Afro-Dominican culture of most of the island was repressed by the colonial government and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, both of which taught that African-derived music was evil, demonic and uncultured.<ref name="Philip">{{cite paper|author=Philip, Daryl|title=Twenty Years of Traditional/Folk Dance in Dominica|version=Thesis for a certificate in dance education|publisher=Jamaica School of Dance|date=1986}} cited in Guilbault, pp 840-844</ref>  This perception changed in the mid- to late 20th century, when Afro-Dominican culture came to be celebrated through the work of promoters like [[Cissie Caudeiron]].<ref name="Guilbault">Guilbault, pp 840-844</ref>

== Characteristics ==

Dominica's terrain is rugged, which has fostered distinct regional traditions.  The northern, eastern, southern, western and central parts of the island are [[music area]]s.  The villages of [[Wesley, Dominica|Wesley]] and [[Marigot]] are also unique in their preservation of English language and music rather than the more French-based styles of the rest of the island.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

Dominican folk music is an [[oral tradition]], learned informally through watching others perform.  As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over fifty years old or under thirty-five, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions.<ref name="Philip"/>  Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythms, as well as social factors, such as the ability of the performers to improvise and respond to their surroundings and to keep the audience excited and participating in the music.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

Characteristics of Dominican music include the use of [[call and response]] singing, [[clapping]] as a major part of rhythm and lyrical, dance and rhythmic [[improvisation]].  Lyrics are almost all in French Creole, and are traditionally sung by women (''chantwèl''), while the instrumental traditions are predominantly practiced by men. Drums, generically known as ''lapo kabwit'', are the most prominent part of Dominica's instrumental tradition.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

== Folk music ==
[[Image:Dominicaband.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A Dominican drumming band]]
Dominican folk music includes, most influentially, the French Antillean [[quadrille]] tradition, the ''jing ping'' style of dance music, as well as [[bélé]] and heel-and-toe [[polka]]. Traditional Carnival music includes [[chanté mas]] and [[lapo kabwit]]. Folk music on Dominica has historically been a part of everyday life, including [[work song]]s, [[religious music]] and secular, recreational music.<ref name="tradition">{{cite web|url=http://www.divisionofculture.org/traditionalinstruments.htm|work=Division of Culture|title=Some Instruments Used In Traditional Music|accessdate=December 3|accessyear=2005}}</ref>

The [[quadrille]] is the most important dance of the Dominican folk tradition, which also includes the [[lancer (dance)|lancer]] and distinctive forms of several dances, many of them derived from European styles.  The ''bidjin'' ([[biguine]]), ''mereng'' ([[merengue music|merengue]]), ''sotis'' ([[schottische]]), ''polka pil'' (pure [[polka]]), ''vals o vyenn'' (Viennese [[waltz]]) and ''mazouk'' ([[mazurka]]) are particularly widespread.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

=== Bélé ===

Bélé are folk songs traditionally performed recreationally in the evening during the [[full moon]], and more rarely, ''lavèyé'' ([[funeral wake|wakes]]).  The bélé tradition has declined in the 20th and 21st century, but is still performed for holidays like [[Easter]], [[Independence Day]], [[Christmas]], [[Jounen Kwéyòl]] and [[patron saint]] festivals held annually in the [[Parishes of Dominica]], especially in the ''Fèt St.-Pierre'' and the ''Fèt St.-Isidore'' for fishermen and workers respectively.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

All bélé are accompanied by an eponymous drum, the ''tanbou bélé'', along with the ''tingting'' ([[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]) and ''chakchak'' ([[maraca]]s).  Bélés start with a lead vocalist, who is followed by the responsorial chorus (''lavwa''), then a drummer and dancers.  Traditional dances revolve around stylized [[courtship]] between a male and female dancer, known as the ''kavalyé'' and ''danm'' respectively.  The bélé song-dances include the ''bélé soté'', ''bélé priòrité'', ''bélé djouba'', ''bélé contredanse'', ''bélé rickety'' and ''bélé pitjé''.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

=== Quadrille ===

The [[quadrille]] is a dance form that is an important symbol of French Antillean culture, not just in Dominica, but also [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] and other Francophone islands.  Dominican quadrilles are traditionally performed by four sets of couples in subscription picnics or dances, and in private parties.  However, the quadrille tradition now only survives at holidays and festivals.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

The Dominican quadrille generally has four figures, the ''pastouwèl'', ''lapoul'', ''lété'' and ''latrinitez''.  Some regions of Dominica, such as [[Petite Savanne]], are home to local variants such as the ''caristo''.  Many quadrilles are found across Dominica under a wide variety of names.  In addition to the standard quadrille, the [[lancer (dance)|lancer]] is also an important Dominican dance.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

Accompaniment for the quadrille is provided by a four instrument ensemble called a ''[[jing ping]]'' band, or less commonly, an ''accordion band''; jing ping groups also accompany the ''flirtation'', a [[circle dance]].  Jing ping bands are made up of a ''boumboum'' ([[boom pipe]]), ''syak'' or ''gwaj'' ([[Scraper (instrument)|scraper]]-[[Rattle (percussion)|rattle]]), ''tambal'' or ''tanbou'' ([[tambourine]]) and [[accordion]].  The [[double bass]] and [[banjo]] are also sometimes used.<ref>[http://www.divisionofculture.org/traditionalinstruments.htm Division of Culture] is the source for the term ''accordion band'' and confirms the primary instrumentation with Guilbault, pp. 840-844; Guilbault does not confirm the use of double bass or banjo.</ref>  Bamboo flutes led the jing ping ensembles before the 1940s, when accordions were introduced.  The Dominican flute tradition declined as a result, despite their additional use in [[serenade]]s, until being revived after the [[National Independence Competitions]].<ref>{{cite paper|author=Cardinal, José|title=La Flûte de Bambou dans Quatres Îsles des Antilles (Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominique et Sainte-Lucie)|version=Master's thesis|publisher=Université de Montréal}} cited in Guilbault, pg. 842</ref>

=== Other folk music ===

Dominica's folk musical heritage includes [[work song]]s, [[storytelling]], children's music and masquerade songs.  Dominican work songs are accompanied by the ''tambou twavay'' drum, and are performed by workers while gathering fruit, building roads, fishing, moving a house or sawing wood.  Many are responsorial, and are generally short and simple, with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied.  On modern Dominica, work songs are rarely performed.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

The ''kont'', or storytelling, folk tradition of Dominica was focused around entertainment for night-time festivals, funeral wakes and feasts and festivals.  Modern ''kont'' is mostly performed during major festival competitions.  Most ''kont'' storytellers work with local traditions, such as legends and history, and provide an ethical or moral message.  A one line theme song, often based around a duet between two characters, recurs throughout most ''kont'' performances.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Cissie Caudeiron|author=Caudeiron, Maude "Cissie"|year=1988|chapter=Music and Songs of Dominica|title=Our Island Culture|editor=Lennox Honychurch (ed.)|page=48-54|publisher=Letchworth Press|location=Barbados}} cited in Guilbault, pp 840-844</ref>

Unlike most Dominican folk songs, children's songs and musical games are mostly in English. They were originally in the same Creole as the rest of the island, but have come to be primarily of English, Scottish, and Irish derivation. Children's musical traditions include ring games and circle dances, and music accompanied by thigh-slapping and circle dancing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stubbs, Norris|title=Survey of the Folk Music of Dominica|location=Roseau|publisher=Dominica Arts Council, Hilton Services|year=1973}} and {{Cite video|people=Okada, Yuki. JVC Smithsonian Folkways Video Anthology of Music and Dance of the Americas, 4|medium=Video|year=1995|title=The Caribbean|publisher=Multicultural Media VTMV-228|location=Montpelier, Vermont}} both cited in Guilbault, pp 840-844</ref>

The [[chanté mas]] ([[masquerade]] song) tradition is based around pre-calypso Carnival music performed in a responsorial style by partygoers.  The Dominican Carnival masquerade lasted for two days of parading through the streets, with a singer dancing backwards in front of the drummer on a ''tanbou lélé''.  Chant&eacute mas lyrics are traditionally based on gossip and scandal, and addressed the personal shortcomings of others.<ref name="Guilbault"/>

== Popular music ==

The first internationally known bands from Dominica were [[1970s]] groups like [[Exile One]] and [[Grammacks]]. These bands were the stars of the [[cadence-lypso]] scene, which was the first style of Dominican music to become popular across the Caribbean. By the [[1980s]], however, Martinican [[zouk]] and other styles were more popular. In [[1988]], WCK formed, playing an experimental fusion of cadence-lypso with the island’s jing ping sound. The result became known as [[bouyon music|bouyon]], and has re-established Dominica in the field of popular music.<ref name="tradition"/>

=== Early popular music ===

Dominican [[popular music]] history can be traced back to the [[1940s]] and [[1950s|50s]], when dance bands like the [[Casimir Brothers]] and later, [[The Swinging Stars]], became famous across the island. Their music was a dance-oriented version of many kinds of Caribbean and Latin popular music, such as [[Cuba]]n [[bolero]], [[Brazil]]ian [[samba music|samba]], the [[merengue music|merengue]] of the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Trinidad]]ian [[calypso music|calypso]] and [[funk]].

By the beginning of the [[1960s]], calypso and Trinidadian [[steelpan]] became the most popular styles of music on Dominica, replacing traditional Carnival music like [[chanté mas]] and [[lapo kabwit]]. Early recording stars from this era included [[Swinging Busters]], [[The Gaylords (Dominican band)|The Gaylords]], [[De Boys an Dem]] and [[Los Caballeros]], while [[chorale]] groups also gained fans, especially [[Lajenne Etwal]], [[Siflé Montan'y]] and the [[Dominica Folk singers]].<ref name="Guilbault"/> These early popular musicians were aided by the spread of [[radio broadcasting]], beginning with [[WIDBS]] and later [[Radio Dominica]].<ref name="contemporary">{{cite web|url=http://www.divisionofculture.org/contemporarymusic.htm|work=Division of Culture|title=Contemporary Music In Dominica: 1950-2000|accessdate=December 3|accessyear=2005}}</ref>

Of these early popular musicians, a few pioneering the use of native influences. The Gaylords’ hits, like “Ti Mako”, “Pray for the Blackman”, “Lovely Dominica” and “Douvan Jo”, were either [[English language|English]] or the native Creole, ''kwéyòl''. By the end of the 1960s and beginning of the [[1970s]], American [[rock and roll]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] had reached Dominica and left lasting influences. Funky rock-based bands like [[Voltage Four]], [[Woodenstool]] and [[Every Mother's Child]] became popular.<ref name="contemporary"/>

Calypso has been popular in Dominica since the 1950s; the first Calypso King was crowned in [[1959]]. Popular calypso in Dominica has always been closely associated with [[steelpan]] music.  The first wave of Dominican steelpan includes bands like [[Esso (band)|Esso]], [[Shell and Regent]], [[Vauxhall (band)|Vauxhall]] and [[Old Oak]].

[[Cadence-lypso]] developed in the 1970s, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim, eventually becoming a part of styles like [[zouk]]. The most influential band in the development of cadence-lypso was [[Exile One]] who combined calypso with [[compas]] and [[cadence]], styles derived from [[music of Haiti|Haitian music]].  Cadence-lypso was influenced by nationalist movement that espoused [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and [[Black Power]]. Many groups performed songs with intensely ideological positions, and much of the repertoire was in the vernacular ''kwéyòl'' language.<ref name="contemporary"/>

=== Recent popular music ===

During the 1980s, cadence-lypso’s popularity declined greatly. Some Dominican performers remained famous, such as [[Ophelia Marie|Ophelia]], a very renowned singer of the period. Popular music during this time was mostly [[zouk]], a style pioneered by the Martinican band [[Kassav]], who used styles of folk [[music of Martinique and Guadeloupe]]. [[Soca music|Soca]], a kind of [[music of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian music]], was also popular at the time, producing bands like [[RSB (band)|RSB]], [[WCK|Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK)]] and [[First Serenade]]. The 80s also saw a rise in popular for [[jazz]] and the formation of several jazz bands, while groups like Exile One began exploring tradition rhythms from ''jing ping'' and ''lapo kabwit''.<ref name="contemporary"/>

Bouyon is a fusion of jing ping, cadence-lypso and other styles of [[Caribbean music]], developed by a band called ''Windward Caribbean Kulture'' (later ''WCK''). WCK was among the most prominent of 80s Dominican soca bands. They began using native drum rhythms and elements of the music of jing ping bands, as well as [[ragga]]-style vocals. Bouyon is popular across the Caribbean, and is known as ''jump up music'' in Guadeloupe and Martinique. A modern offshoot of bouyon, ''[[bouyon-muffin]]'', uses more prominent elements of Jamaican [[raggamuffin]] music. Modern bouyon bands include [[Rough and Ready (band)|Rough and Ready]], [[Wassin Warriors]] and [[Seramix]].<ref name="contemporary"/>

{{listen|filename=Wck - conch shell.ogg|title=WCK's "Conch Shell"|description=WCK (Windward Caribbean Kulture) is one of the most prominent popular musicians of Dominica, and has performed styles such as bouyon and soca.}}

Religious music, influenced by American [[gospel music|gospel]], has become an important part of Dominican popular music in the 1990s. Performers include [[Cegid]], [[Exeters]], [[Agnes Aaron]], [[Leon Esprit]], [[Jerry Lloyd]] and [[End Time Singers]].  Calypso has also retained much popularity in Dominica, as has jazz. The band [[Impact (band)|Impact]] has fused jazz with Caribbean music. Other styles include steelpan, which has declined popularity despite the efforts of groups like [[Phase Five]], and [[dancehall]], which includes performers like [[Puppa Tino]], [[Miekey Moreau]], [[Cecil Moses]] and [[Skinny Banton]].<ref name="contemporary"/>

== Music institutions and festivals ==

The [[Caribbean Carnival]] is an important part of the Dominican culture.  Originally featuring masquerade songs (''chanté mas'') and other local traditions, traditional Carnival, ''[[Mas Domnik]]'', came to be dominated by imported [[calypso music]] and [[steel band]]s in the early 1960s; calypso appealed to Carnival-goers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of ''chanté mas'', despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast sharply with traditional Dominican ''Mas Domnik'' music.  After a fire in 1963, the traditional Carnival was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity.<ref name="Guilbault"/>  Modern Carnival on Dominica takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before [[Ash Wednesday]], and is a festive occasion during which laws against [[libel]] and [[slander]] are suspended.  The modern Dominican Carnival is heavily based on the Trinidadian celebration, but is not as commercialized due to a lack of corporate sponsorship.<ref>Cameron, pg. 658</ref>

The [[World Creole Music Festival]] takes place on the island of Dominica, in [[Festival City (Roseau)|Festival City]], [[Roseau]], which is run by the governmental [[Dominica Festivals Commission]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dominica.dm/festivals.htm|work=Dominica Festivals|title=Our Festivals and Events|accessdate=December 3|accessyear=2005}}</ref> The [[National Independence Competitions]] are an important part of Dominican musical culture.  They were founded by [[Chief Minister of Dominica]] [[Edward Olivier Leblanc]] in 1965, and promote the traditional music and dance of Dominica.  The [[government of Dominica]] also promotes Dominican music through the [[Dominican Broadcasting Station]], which broadcasts between 20% and 25% local music as a matter of policy.<ref name="Guilbault"/>
