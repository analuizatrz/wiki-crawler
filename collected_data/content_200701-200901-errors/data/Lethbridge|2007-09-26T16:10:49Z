'''Lethbridge''' is a city in the province of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], and the largest city in [[southern Alberta]]. It is Alberta's fourth largest city by population after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]]. At 127.19&nbsp;square kilometres (49.1&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), it is the third largest in area after Calgary and Edmonton.

The city is near the [[Canadian Rockies]], which provides the city with mild winters and a [[Chinook wind|windy climate]], and is 210&nbsp;kilometres (130&nbsp;mi) southeast of Calgary on the [[Oldman River]]. 

The city developed from [[Drift mining|drift mines]] opened in the late [[19th century]] and [[agriculture]] in the early [[20th century]]. Half of the city's economy is based in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government based. It has grown into the commercial, financial, transportational and industrial centre of southern Alberta.

Lethbridge provides the only university in Alberta south of Calgary, and two of the three colleges in southern Alberta have campuses in the city. There are several cultural venues in the city, including performing art theatres, museums and sports centres.

==History==
{{main|History of Lethbridge}}
After the US Army outlawed alcohol trading in 1869 with the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation|Blackfeet Nation]] in Montana, traders [[John Healy|John J. Healy]] and [[Alfred Hamilton|Alfred B. Hamilton]] started the whiskey trading post Fort Hamilton, which later came to be nicknamed [[Fort Whoop-Up]].<ref name="Ellis">{{cite web |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/Short+History.htm |title=A Short History of Lethbridge, Alberta| author=Greg Ellis |month=October |year=2001 |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>

The whiskey trade eventually led to the [[Cypress Hills massacre]] of many [[Assiniboine]] in 1873. The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North West Mounted Police]] arrived in the area to stop the trade and establish order.<ref name="Ellis"/> The NWMP arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on [[9 October]] [[1874]], and they continued to maintain a post and trade for the following 12 years.<ref name="Ellis"/>

Lethbridge developed from [[drift mines]] opened by [[Nicholas Sheran]] ([[1874]]) and the [[North Western Coal and Navigation Company]] ([[1882]]), whose president was [[William Lethbridge]], from whom the city derives its name.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Battle Park |publisher=City of Lethbridge |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/City+Hall/Departments/Parks+-+Pathways+-+Trails/Major+Parks/Indian+Battle+Park/Indian+Battle+Park.htm |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> By the twentieth century, the mines employed about 150 men and produced about 300 tonnes of coal each day.<ref name="Ellis"/> By the time production peaked during [[World War I]], local collieries were the largest coal producers in the [[Northwest Territories]].<ref>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/History+of+Lethbridge/Masonry+Sculptures/Masonry.htm City of Lethbridge website]</ref> Increased oil and natural gas production after the war caused the decline of coal production,<ref name="Ellis"/> and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957. 

The first rail line in Lethbridge was built on [[28 August]] [[1885]] by the [[Alberta Railway and Coal Company]],<ref name="Ellis" /> five years before they purchased the North Western Coal and Navigation Company.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alberta Railway and Coal Company |work=Table of Private Acts (1867 to December 31, 2006), Railways |publisher=Department of Justice Canada |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/privlaw/214797/2525.html |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> The rail industry's dependence of coal and the CPR's immigration efforts to settle southern Alberta led to Lethbridge becoming instrumental in the economic success of the region. After the CPR moved the divisional point of its Crowsnest Line from Fort Macleod to Lethbridge in 1905, the city became a regional centre for [[Southern Alberta]]; something the region lacked previously.<ref name="Ellis"/> In the mid-1980s, CPR moved the rail yards in downtown Lethbridge to nearby [[Kipp, Alberta|Kipp]] and Lethbridge ceased operating as a hub for rail traffic in the province.<ref>{{cite web |title=Executive Summary |work=Highways 3 & 4, Lethbridge and Area NHS & NSTC, Functional Planning Study, #R - 970 |publisher=Stantec Consulting Ltd. |date=February 2006 |url=http://www.infratrans.gov.ab.ca/INFTRA_Content/docType182/Production/exec_summ.pdf |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>

Between 1907 and 1913, a development boom occurred in Lethbridge, making it the main marketing, distribution and service centre in southern Alberta.<ref name="Ellis"/> Such municipal projects as a water treatment plant, a power plant, a [[Lethbridge Transit|streetcar system]], and [[Exhibition Park (Lethbridge)|exhibition buildings]], as well as a construction boom and rising real estate prices transformed the mining town into a significant city.<ref name="Ellis"/>

Between World War I and [[World War II]], however,  the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak before 1920.<ref name="Ellis"/> Following World War II, irrigation in the surrounding area caused the city's population to swell, which in turn boosted the local economy. [[Lethbridge College]] (previosuly Lethbridge Community College) opened in April 1957, and the [[University of Lethbridge]] in 1967.<ref name="Ellis"/>

==Government==
[[Image:Lethbridge City Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Lethbridge City Hall]]
{{seealso|Lethbridge City Council}}
Eight at-large aldermen and a [[List of mayors of Lethbridge, Alberta|mayor]] make up the [[Lethbridge City Council]]. Lethbridge elects a new government every three years, in October. The City of Lethbridge has an operating budget of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]200 million, more than half of which comes from [[property tax]].<ref>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/DDEC3079-A129-49FD-AF56-EAB1E41CBDEB/4462/BudgetPresentation0608BudgetOverview.pdf 2006–2008 Preliminary Operating Budget Overview], City of Lethbridge</ref>

Lethbridgians elect representatives to the federal, provincial, and municipal levels of government. One Member of Parliament (MPs) representing [[Lethbridge (electoral district)|Lethbridge]] sits in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] in [[Ottawa]], and two members of Alberta's [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|legislative assembly]] (MLAs), representing [[Lethbridge East]] and [[Lethbridge West]], sit in the legislative assembly in Edmonton. Being Alberta's fourth most populous city, provincial offices are located in the city.

===Climate===
Lethbridge has a moderate continental climate with an average maximum temperature of 12.3°[[Celsius|C]] (54.14°[[Farenheit|F]]) and an average minimum temperature of -1°C (30.2°F). Average precipitation amounts to 386.3&nbsp;millimetres (15.21&nbsp;in), but Lethbridge the second driest city in the country.<ref name="winners" /> Lethbridge has an average wind speed of 18.20&nbsp;km/h (11.31&nbsp;mph) and places second in the country for the most windy days of 40&nbsp;km/h (25&nbsp;mph) or more.<ref name="winners">[http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/weather/winners/intro-e.html Weather Winners], Environment Canada. Accessed [[26 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

Its high elevation of 929&nbsp;metres (3,048&nbsp;ft) and close proximity to the Rocky Mountains provides Lethbridge with summers relatively cooler than other locations in the prairies.<ref name="bus-inv-profile">[http://www.chooselethbridge.ca/media/publication_1.pdf  Business Investment Profile 2005/2006], Economic Development Lethbridge. 2005.

==Major attractions==
[[Image:lethbridge Viaduct.gif|thumb|right|High Level Bridge near downtown Lethbridge.]]
The [[Lethbridge Viaduct]], commonly known as the ''High Level Bridge'', is a steel trestle bridge. It was completed in [[1909]] on what was then the city's western edge.

[[Indian Battle Park]], located in the [[coulee]]s of the [[Oldman River]], commemorates the last battle between the [[Cree]] and the [[Blackfoot]] [[First Nations]] in [[1870]].

[[Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden]], located in south Lethbridge, was opened in [[1967]] in celebration for the Canadian centennial. It was a royal event with [[Japan]]’s Prince and Princess [[Prince Takamatsu|Takamatsu]] leading a list of special guests.

[[Image:Fort Whoop-Up.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Whoop-Up in Lethbridge.]]
Originally known as Fort Hamilton, [[Fort Whoop-Up]] was a centre of illegal activities during the late [[19th century]]. It was first built in [[1869]] by J.J. Healy and A.B. Hamilton as a whiskey post and was destroyed by fire a year later. A second, sturdier structure later replaced the fort. 

[[Galt Museum & Archives]] is the largest museum in the Lethbridge area. Its building once served as the main hospital in the city during the late 19th century and early [[20th century]]. It has an extensive archive collection and hosts exhibits. Between 2004–2006, it underwent major renovation, which included a 5,000-square foot exhibit centre, a larger store, and a 2,500-square foot education centre.

[[Paradise Canyon Golf Resort]], located in the city's southwest, is a world-class golf course with amenities available in larger cities. The eighteen-hole course lies next to the Oldman River.

===Skyline===
[[Image:Lethbridge skyline.jpg|thumb|right|Skyline of downtown Lethbridge.]]
There are several prominent structures on Lethbridge's skyline, some of which are unique to the city. One prominent landmark is the [[Lethbridge Post Office|post office]]. While less recognized as the High Level Bridge, it is one of the most distinctive buildings in Lethbridge. The four-storey building was built in 1912 and is crowned by a functioning clock tower.

Other prominent buildings include office towers; the [[Lethbridge Water Tower|water tower]], which was originally built in 1958 and sold to a private developer who converted it into a restaurant; and the Alberta Terminals grain elevators.

==Education==
The public [[Lethbridge School District No. 51|Lethbridge School District]] and the separate Catholic [[Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Separate Regional Division No. 4|Holy Spirit Division]] administer grades Kindergarten through 12 locally. The [[Palliser Regional Division No. 26|Palliser School Division]], which is based in Lethbridge, administer public primary and secondary education in the outlying areas. The [[Third Academy]] private school has a campus in Lethbridge.

Lethbridge is home to [[Lethbridge College]],  founded in [[1957]], and the [[University of Lethbridge]], founded in [[1967]]. [[Red Crow Community College]] has a campus in the city. During the 2003–2004 school year, the post secondary student population in the city was approximately 14,000 at both the University of Lethbridge and the Lethbridge Community College, which is roughly 20% of the city's population.<ref>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/D4CEB98B-9F18-4786-870D-84A06E1533FC/310/LethbridgeProfile2003.pdf Lethbridge Profile, 2003–2004], City of Lethbridge</ref>

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Lethbridge}}
Mass transit in Lethbridge consists of forty buses (with an average age of ten years) covering the city on over a dozen routes.<ref>{{cite news |date=[[2006-09-09]] |title=Richard keeps the city's buses on the road |publisher=Lethbridge Herald |first=Dave |last=Mabell |language=English |page=A4}}</ref> Traditionally, bus routes in the city started and ended downtown. In the early twenty-first century, however, [[Lethbridge Transit]] introduced cross-town and shuttle routes.

The Parks and Recreation department maintains the citywide, thirty-kilometre, pedestrian/cyclist [[Coal Banks Trail]] system ([http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/12EB4100-4704-49B2-85B1-26053A428E37/733/Coal_Banks.pdf map]). The system was designed to connect the [[Oldman River]] valley with other areas of the city, including Pavan Park in the north, Henderson Lake in the east, [[Alberta Highway 4|Highways 4]] and [[Alberta Highway 5|5]] in the south and a loop in West Lethbridge (including University Drive and McMaster Blvd).<ref>{{cite web |title=Coal Banks Trail |publisher=City of Lethbridge |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/City+Hall/Departments/Parks+-+Pathways+-+Trails/Pathways+and+Trails/Coal+Banks+Trail/Coal+Banks+Trail.htm |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>

Four provincial highways ([[Crowsnest Highway|3]], 4, 5, and [[Alberta Highway 25|25]]) run through or terminate in Lethbridge. This has led to the creation of major arterial roads (including Mayor Magrath Drive, University Drive and Scenic Drive). This infrastructure, and its location on the [[CANAMEX Corridor]], has led to Lethbridge being a major shipping destination, with shipping lines having depots located in the city.<ref name="chamber"/>

Lethbridge is 100&nbsp;kilometres (62&nbsp;mi) north of the [[United States]] border via Highways 4 and 5; and 210&nbsp;kilometres (130&nbsp;mi) south of [[Calgary]] via [[Alberta Highway 2|Highways 2]] and 3. Highways 2, 3 and 4 form part of the [[CANAMEX]] trade route between [[Mexico]], the [[United States]], and Canada.<ref name="chamber"/>

Lethbridge is very close to the [[Lethbridge County Airport]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] rail yards in [[Kipp, Alberta|Kipp]]. The rail yards were moved to Kipp, just west of the city, from downtown Lethbridge in [[1983]] to make way for commercial expansion.<ref>[http://www.crowsnest-highway.ca/cgi-bin/citypage.pl?city=COALHURST Coalhurst, Alberta : History], The Virtual Crowsnest Highway. Accessed [[26 December]] [[2006]].</ref> The county airport provides commercial flights to several Alberta cities (such as [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]) and [[Mexico]], as well as private and charter flights elsewhere. The airport provides customs services for flights coming in from the United States.
