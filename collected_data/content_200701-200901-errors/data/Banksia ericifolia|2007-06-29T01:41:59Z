The '''Heath-leaved Banksia''' (''Banksia ericifolia''), also known as the '''Lantern Banksia''' or '''Heath Banksia''', is a [[species]] of woody [[shrub]] of the [[Proteaceae]] family native to Australia; it occurs in two separate regions of  Central and Northern [[New South Wales]] east of the [[Great Dividing Range]]. Well known for its orange or red autumn inflorescences which contrast with its green fine-leaved heath-like foliage, it generally encountered as a medium to large shrub which can reach 6&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;ft) high and wide, though is usually half the size. In exposed heathlands and coastal areas it is more often 1-2&nbsp;m (3-7&nbsp;ft).

''Banksia ericifolia'' was one of the original ''[[Banksia]]'' species collected by [[Joseph Banks]] around [[Botany Bay]] in 1770 and was named by [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger|Carl Linnaeus the Younger]], son of [[Carolus Linnaeus]], in 1782. A distinctive plant, it has been split into two subspecies: ''Banksia ericifolia'' subspecies ''ericifolia'' of the Sydney region and ''Banksia ericifolia'' subspecies ''macrantha'' of the New South Wales [[Northern Rivers, New South Wales|Far North Coast]] which was recognized in 1996.

''Banksia ericifolia'' has been widely grown in Australian [[garden]]s on the east coast for many years as well as being used to a limited extent in the cut flower industry. Compact dwarf cultivars such as ''Banksia'' "Little Eric" have become more popular in recent years with the trend to smaller gardens. 

==Description==
[[Image:Banksia ericifolia WC multibuds email.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Banksia ericifolia|B. ericifolia]]'' "White Candles" showing multiple spikes]]
''Banksia ericifolia'' grows as a large shrub to 6&nbsp;metres (20&nbsp;ft) in height, though often smaller, around 1-2&nbsp;metres (3-6&nbsp;ft) in exposed places such as coastal or mountain heathlands. The bark is a smooth grey colour with [[lenticel]]s, though can become thicker with age. The linear dark green leaves are small and narrow, 9–20&nbsp;mm (⅓-¾&nbsp;in) long and up to 1&nbsp;mm wide, generally with two small 'teeth' at the tips. Crowded, they are alternately arranged on the branches.<ref name ="Harden02"/> New growth generally occurs in summer and is an attractive lime green colour.<ref name ="Taylor 1988">{{The Banksia Atlas}}</ref> 

Flowering is in autumn or winter in cooler areas; the [[inflorescence]]s, or flower spikes are 7-22&nbsp;cm (3-10&nbsp;in) high and 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) broad or so.  Each individual flower consists of a tubular [[perianth]] made up of four united [[tepal]]s, and one long wiry [[carpel|style]]. Characteristic of the taxonomic section in which it is placed, the styles are hooked rather than straight. The style ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at [[anthesis]].<ref name ="George_1999"/> The spikes are red or gold in overall colour, with styles golden, orange or orange-red, or burgundy. Some unusual forms have red styles on a whitish perianth which can be striking. Very occasionally, forms with all yellow inflorescences are seen. Though not terminal, the flower spikes are fairly prominently displayed emerging from the foliage; they arise from two- to three-year-old nodes.

Old flowers fall off the cones, often to reveal numerous small dark grey to dull black finely furred [[follicle]]s. Oblong in shape and 15-20&nbsp;mm (⅓-⅔&nbsp;in) in diameter, they are ridged on each valve and remain closed until burnt by fire.<ref name = "Harden02"/> ''Banksia ericifolia'' responds to fire by seeding, the parent plant being killed. As plants take several years to flower in the wild it is very sensitive to too-frequent burns and has been eliminated in some areas where this occurs. With time and the production of more cones with seed-contianing follicles, however, plants can store up to 16,500 seeds at eight years of age.<ref name ="Honig92">{{cite journal |author=Honig MA, Cowling RM, Richardson DM  |year=1992|title= The invasive potential of Australian banksias in South African fynbos: A comparison of the reproductive potential of ''Banksia ericifolia'' and ''Leucadendron laureolum'' |journal= Australian journal of ecology|volume= 17|issue=3 |pages=305-314 |id= |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=2811337&q=Banksia+ericifolia&uid=788363120&setcookie=yes (abstract) |accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref>

''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' was first collected at [[Botany Bay]] on [[29 April]] [[1770]], by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander|Dr Daniel Solander]], naturalists on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' during Lieutenant (later Captain) [[James Cook]]'s [[James Cook#First voyage (1768-1771)|first voyage]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name="Wharton 1893">{{cite book | editor = William J.

Linnaeus distinguished the species by their leaf shapes, and named them accordingly. Thus the species with leaves reminiscent of [[heather]] formerly of the genus ''[[Erica]]'' was given the specific name ''ericaefolia'', from the Latin ''erica'', meaning "heather", and ''folium'', meaning "leaf".<ref name="L.f. 1782">{{cite book | author = [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] | year = 1782 | title = [[Supplementum Plantarum]] | location = Brunsvigae | publisher = Orphanotrophei}}</ref> The [[Binomial nomenclature#Authorship in scientific names|full name]] for the species is therefore '''''Banksia ericifolia'' L.f.'''<ref name="APNI">{{APNI | name = ''Banksia ericifolia'' L.f. | id = 53469}}</ref>

Salisbury described this plant as ''Banksia phylicaefolia'' in 1796, though this was not adopted. Though many species have undergone much taxonomic change over the next 200 years, the distinctive ''Banksia ericifolia'' as a species concept remained unchanged until the northern form was published as a distinct taxon, ''macrantha'', in 1996. Alf Salkin had noted this in 1979, giving it the name ''microphylla''. He also noted some differences in those populations of the Blue Mountains and felt there were three distinct forms in total, with one being a possible hybrid with [[Banksia spinulosa var. cunninghamii|''Banksia spinulosa'' var. ''cunninghamii'']].<ref name = "Salkin79"/>

===Placement within ''Banksia''===
''Banksia ericifolia''  has classically been described as lying within series [[Banksia ser. Spicigerae|''Banksia'' ser.

Molecular research by Austin Mast suggests that ''B. spinulosa'' and ''B. ericifolia'' may be more closely related to series [[Banksia ser. Salicinae|''Banksia'' ser. ''Salicinae'']], with ''[[Banksia integrifolia]]'' and its relatives.<ref name="Mast 2002">{{cite journal | author = [[Austin Mast|Mast, Austin]] and Thomas J.

In 2005, Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for ''Banksia''. They inferred a [[phylogeny]] markedly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding ''Banksia'' to be [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with respect to ''[[Banksia ser.

===Subspecies===
[[Image:Banksia flower02.jpg|thumb|orange flowers & long leaves, [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]]]]
Two geographically distinct forms are recognised:

*'''''Banksia ericifolia''''' subsp. '''''ericifolia''''': The nominate race is found in the Sydney basin, south to the Illawarra and north to Collaroy, as well as the Blue Mountains. The seedling leaves have 2–6 teeth on each margin, while on the inflorescences the perianths are 19–22 mm long and pistils are 30–35 mm long. Salkin noted that this subspecies often grew in association with ''Banksia spinulosa'' var. ''cunninghamii'' and that there appeared plants which have longer leaves some 20-25 mm long with entire revolute margins. He gave them the name "longifolia" and suspected these may have been hybrids between the two species.<ref name = "Salkin79"/>

*'''''Banksia ericifolia''''' subsp. '''''macrantha''''': The northern race is found on the New South Wales north coast, from Crowdy Head northwards to the Queensland border. Described as a distinct subspecies in 1996 by Alex George from material he collected at [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] in 1975, it is distinguished by finer foliage, more crowded leaves and larger flowers, with the perianths 26–28 mm long and pistils 46–48 mm long. The seedling leaves have one, or occasionally two, teeth on each margin. Salkin observed that the inflorescences tended to be terminal rather than axial,<ref name = "Salkin79"/> and others have noted them to be sometimes taller than the nominate subspecies. Crowdy Bay, in particular, hosts specimens with spikes up to 26 cm in height.<ref name ="Taylor 1988"/>

===Name and symbolism===
In 1992 it was adopted as the official plant of [[Sydney]],<ref>{{cite web  | author = Sydney City Council
  | title = Sydney's Official Flower | publisher = Sydney City Council | date = | url = http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/AboutSydney/HistoryAndArchives/CivicHistory/SymbolsOfTheCity/SydneysOfficialFlower.asp
 | accessdate = 2007-06-20}}</ref> and is sometimes seen in amenity plantings and parks around the city. It was known as '''wadanggari''' (pron. "wa-tang-gre") to the local [[Eora]] and [[Darug]] 
inhabitants of the Sydney basin.<ref>{{cite book|author=Troy, Jakelin|year=1993|title=The sydney language|publisher=Jakelin Troy| location=Canberra|isbn=0-646-11015-2}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
In nature, the variety ''ericifolia'' is found on acidic sandstone-based soils, generally in elevated heathland around the [[Sydney]] basin, from [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]] south to [[Jervis Bay]], as well as sandstone soils in mountainous areas such as the [[Blue Mountains]] and the [[Budawangs]] to the west of coastal areas.<ref name ="Taylor 1988"/> The inflorescences are a feature of autumn bushwalking in sandstone areas, such as the Kings Tableland walk in the Blue Mountains, Jennifer Street Boardwalk in [[Little Bay]], and [[Royal National Park]].

The northern subspecies ''macrantha'' is found in two divided regions on the far north coast of [[New South Wales]]; the first from Crowdy Bay on the [[Mid North Coast, New South Wales|Mid North Coast]] northwards to [[Hat Head National Park]] north of [[Port Macquarie]], and then from [[Yuraygir National Park]] north to [[Kingscliff, New South Wales|Kingscliff]] just south of the [[Queensland]] border. This variety is more strictly coastal with most populations being found within two kilometres of the coast.<ref name ="Taylor 1988"/>

==Ecology==
{{seealso|Ecology of Banksia}}
Like other banksias, ''B. ericifolia'' plays host to a wide variety of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn when other flowers are scarce. It has been the subject of a number of studies on pollination. A 1998 study in [[Bundjalung National Park]] in Northern New South Wales found that ''B. ericifolia'' inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small mammals, including [[marsupial]]s such as the [[Yellow-footed Antechinus]] (''Antechinus flavipes''), and [[rodent]]s such as the [[Pale Field Rat]] (''Rattus tunneyi'') and ''Melomys burtoni'' . These carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectariferous birds, making them effective pollinators.<ref name="Hackett 2001">{{cite journal | first = Damian J. | last = Hackett | coauthors = Ross L. Goldingay | title = Pollination of Banksia spp. by non-flying mammals in north-eastern New South Wales | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 637–644}}</ref> A 1978 study found the [[Bush Rat]] (''Rattus fuscipes'') to bear large amounts of pollen from ''B. ericifolia'' and proposed the hooked styles may play a role in pollination by mammals.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Carpenter| first= F.

A great many bird species have been observed visiting this species. A 1985 study in the [[Sydney]] area of ''B. ericifolia'' var. ''ericifolia'' found numerous creatures visiting the inflorescences, including the bird species, honeyeaters [[Eastern Spinebill]] (''Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris''), [[White-cheeked Honeyeater]] (''Phylidonyris nigra''), [[New Holland Honeyeater]] (''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae''), [[White-naped Honeyeater]] (''Melithreptus lunatus''), [[Yellow-faced Honeyeater]] (''Lichenostomus chrysops''), [[Red Wattlebird]] (''Anthochaera carunculata'') and [[Little Wattlebird]] (''Anthochaera chrysoptera'') as well as the [[Silvereye]] (''Zosterops lateralis''). Some mammals were recorded but were found to bear no pollen. Exclusion of certain pollinators showed that birds and insects were important for fertilisation. <ref name = "Paton85">{{cite journal |last=Paton |first=D.C. |coauthors=V.

Like most other [[Proteaceae]], ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' has [[proteoid root]]s, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance [[solubility|solubilisation]] of [[nutrient]]s, allowing nutrient [[mineral uptake|uptake]] in low-nutrient soils such as the [[phosphorus]]-deficient native soils of [[Australia]].<ref name = "Harden02">{{cite book|last=Harden|first= Gwen|year=2002|chapter=Banksia|editor=Harden, Gwen (ed)|title=Flora of New South Wales: Volume 2 (Revised Edition)|pages=204|publisher=New South Wales University Press|location= Kensington|isbn= 0-86840-156-0}}</ref> The species lacks a [[lignotuber]], so is killed by fire and regenerates from seed. 

''Banksia ericifolia'' depends on fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations can become senescent and eventually die out.<ref name = "Bradstock81">{{cite journal |author= Bradstock RA, Myerscough PJ |year= 1981 |title= Fire effects on seed release and the emergence and establishment of seedling in ''Banksia ericifolia'' L. f.|journal= Australian Journal of Botany |volume= 29|issue= |pages=521-531|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=BT9810521|doi=10.1071/BT9810521}}</ref> However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around 6 years to reach maturity and flower.

==Cultivation==
Historically, ''Banksia ericifolia'' was introduced into cultivation in England in 1788,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cavanagh |first=T |year=1982 |title=A Note on The Cultivation of Banksias in Europe in The 18th and 19th Centuries |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=6 |pages=29-32 |id=ISSN 0728-2893}}</ref> and was mentioned (as ''B. ericaefolia'') in volume 6 of [[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]] where it was described as, "...a handsome shrub, thrives freely, and has flowered in several collections". An illustration was drawn of one growing in [[Vauxhall]], a suburb of south London, in 1802.<ref name = "Salkin79">{{cite book  | last = Salkin  | first = Abraham Isaac | title = Variation In Banksia in Eastern Australia: An Investigation Using Experimental Methods  | publisher = Monash University  | date = 1979  | location = Clayton, Victoria  | pages = 239  }} (Master's thesis)</ref> 

Tough enough to be used as a street plant in parts of Sydney, ''B. ericifolia'' is a fairly easy plant to grow given it is provided with the conditions it likes, namely a sandy well drained soil, sunny aspect and extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to [[Phytophthora cinnamomi|dieback]], like most eastern banksias<ref>{{cite journal| last=McCredie| first=T.A.| coauthors=K.W. Dixon and K. Sivasithamparam|year=1985| title=Variability in the resistance of ''Banksia'' L.f. species to ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' Rands| journal=Australian Journal of Botany| volume=3| issue=6|pages=629-637| doi=10.1071/BT9850629}}</ref>. As it grows naturally on acid soils, ''Banksia ericifolia'' is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as [[chlorosis]], this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins, can occur when planted in soils of high pH. This can happen where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations. It can be treated with iron chelate or [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Eliot RW, Jones DL, Blake T |title=Encyclopaedia of Australian Plants Suitable for Cultivation: Vol. 2|year=1985|pages=292 |publisher=Lothian Press |location=Port Melbourne |isbn=0-85091-143-5}}</ref>

Flowering may take some years from seed; a minimum of four years is standard. Buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a [[cutting]]-grown plant. ''Banksia ericifolia'' can be propagated easily by seed, and is one of the (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Maclean |first=R |year=1995 |title=Propagation of Banksias |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=10 |pages=6-16 |id=ISSN 0728-2893}}</ref> Note that named cultivars are propagated by cuttings.

Regular pruning is important to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia as it lacks a lignotuber. It does not have dormant buds present below the bark which respond to pruning or fire and hence unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species such as ''B. spinulosa'' and ''[[Banksia robur|B. robur]]''.<ref name = "George96">{{The_Banksia_Book}}</ref>
 
For many years attention the horticulture industry focussed on registered selections of ''Banksia spinulosa'', but since the late 1990s more and more cultivars of ''Banksia ericifolia'' have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. This is especially important as the original plant may reach a size of 5 metres in height, and hence helps enthusiasts choose a plant that is right for their conditions and tastes.<ref name ="Lib04">{{cite journal|author=Liber C|year=2004|title=Update on Eastern Cultivars|journal=Banksia Study Group Newsletter|volume=5|issue=1|pages=3–5|publisher=[ASGAP]|url=http://asgap.org.au/banksSG/banksiasg-5-1.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-23 |id=ISSN 1444-285X}}</ref>
