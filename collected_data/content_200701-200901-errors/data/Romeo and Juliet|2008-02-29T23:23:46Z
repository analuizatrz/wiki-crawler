[[Image:Romeo and juliet brown.jpg|thumb|right|''Romeo and Juliet'' in the famous balcony scene by [[Ford Madox Brown]]]]
'''The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet''', better know simply as '''Romeo and Juliet''', is an early [[tragedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]] about two teenage "[[Star-crossed|star-cross'd lovers]]" whose "untimely deaths" ultimately unite their [[feud]]ing households.  The play has been highly praised by literary critics for its language and dramatic effect.  It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with ''[[Hamlet]]'', is one of his most frequently performed plays. Its influence is still seen today, with the two main characters being widely represented as [[archetype|archetypal]] young lovers.

''Romeo and Juliet'' belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to Ancient Greece. Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as ''[[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet|Romeus and Juliet]]'' by [[Arthur Brooke]] in 1562, and retold in prose in ''[[Palace of Pleasure]]'' by [[William Painter]] in 1582. Brooke and Painter were Shakespeare's chief sources of inspiration for ''Romeo and Juliet''. He borrowed heavily from both, but developed minor characters, particularly [[Mercutio]] and [[Count Paris|Paris]], in order to expand the plot. The play was probably written around 1595–1596, and first published as a [[First Quarto|quarto]] in 1597. The text was of poor quality, and later editions corrected it, bringing it more in line with Shakespeare's original text.

Shakespeare's use of [[dramatic structure]], especially his expansion of minor characters, and the use of subplots to embellish the story, has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet form over time. Characters frequently compare love and death and allude to the role of fate.

Since its publication, ''Romeo and Juliet'' has been adapted numerous times in stage, film, musical and operatic forms. During the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], it was revived and heavily revised by [[William Davenant]]. [[David Garrick|Garrick]]'s 18th century version, which continued to be performed into the [[Victorian period|Victorian era]], also changed several scenes, removing material then considered indecent. Performances in the 19th century, including [[Charlotte Cushman]]'s, restored the original text, and focused on greater realism. [[John Gielgud|Gielgud]]'s 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text, and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama.

[[Image:Francesco Hayez 053.jpg|thumb|right|''Romeo and Juliet'' by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
The play begins with a street brawl between two families: the [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Montagues|Montagues]] and the [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Capulets|Capulets]]. The [[Prince Escalus|Prince of Verona, Escalus]], intervenes with his men and declares that the heads of the two families will be held personally accountable for any further breach of the peace.
Later, [[Count Paris]], a young nobleman, talks to Lord Capulet about marrying his thirteen-year-old daughter [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]]. Capulet is wary of this offer, citing the girl's young age, but still invites him to try to attract Juliet's attention during a ball that the family is to hold that night. Juliet's mother tries to persuade her daughter to accept Paris' courtship during this ball, leading Juliet to say that although she will make an effort to love him, she will not express love if it is not there. In this scene [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet character)|Juliet's nurse]] is introduced as a talkative and humorous character, who raised Juliet from infancy. 

In the meantime, a young man named [[Benvolio]] talks with his cousin [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]], Lord Montague's son, over Romeo's recent depression. Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited love for a girl named [[Rosaline]], one of Lord Capulet's nieces who has sworn herself to chastity. Upon the insistence of Benvolio and another friend, [[Mercutio]], Romeo decides to attend the masquerade ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline. Alongside his masked friends Romeo attends the ball as planned, but falls in love with Juliet (forgetting about Rosaline) and she with him. Despite the danger brought on by their feuding families, Romeo sneaks into the Capulet courtyard and overhears Juliet on her balcony vowing her love to him in spite of her family's hatred of the Montague's. Romeo soon makes himself known to her, and the two declare their love for each other and agree to be married. With the help of the Franciscan [[Friar Lawrence]], who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children's union, the two are married secretly the next day.

All seems well until [[Tybalt]], Juliet's hot-blooded cousin, challenges Romeo to a duel for appearing at the Capulets' ball in disguise. Though no one is aware of the marriage yet, Romeo refuses to fight Tybalt since they are now part of the same family. Mercutio is incensed by Tybalt's insolence, and accepts the duel on Romeo's behalf. In the ensuing scuffle, Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo tries to separate them. Romeo, angered by his friend's death, pursues and slays Tybalt, then flees.
 
Despite his promise to call for the head of the wrongdoers, the Prince merely exiles Romeo from Verona, reasoning that Tybalt first killed Mercutio, and that Romeo merely carried out a just punishment of death to Tybalt, although without legal authority. Juliet grieves at the news, and Lord Capulet, misinterpreting her grief, agrees to engage her to marry Paris with the wedding to be held in just three days. He threatens to disown her if she refuses. The nurse, once Juliet's confidante, now tells her she should discard the exiled Romeo and comply. Juliet desperately visits Friar Lawrence for help. He offers her a drug, which will put her into a death-like coma for forty-two hours. She is to take it and, when discovered apparently dead, she will be laid in the family crypt. While she is sleeping the Friar will send a messenger to inform Romeo, so that he can rejoin her when she awakens.

The messenger, however, does not reach Romeo. Romeo then learns of Juliet's "death" from his servant Balthasar. Grief-stricken, he buys poison from an [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Apothecary|apothecary]], returns to Verona in secret, and visits the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Paris confronts Romeo believing him to be a vandal, and in the ensuing battle Romeo kills Paris. He then says his final words to the comatose Juliet and drinks the poison to commit suicide. Juliet then awakens. Friar Lawrence arrives and, realizing of the cause of the tragedy, begs Juliet to leave. She refuses, and at the side of Romeo's dead body, she stabs herself with her lover's dagger.

The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead. In explanation Friar Lawrence recounts the story of the two lovers. Montague reveals that his wife has died of grief after hearing of her son's exile. The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud. The play ends with the Prince's brief elegy for the lovers: "For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

''Romeo and Juliet'' is a dramatisation of [[Arthur Brooke]]'s [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] ''[[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet]]'' (1562). Shakespeare follows the poem closely<ref>Roberts (1902: 41–44).</ref> but adds extra detail to both major and minor characters, in particular the [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet character)|Nurse]] and [[Mercutio]]. ''"The goodly History of the true and constant love of Rhomeo and Julietta"'' retells in prose a story by [[William Painter]], with which Shakespeare may have been familiar. It was published in a collection of Italian tales entitled ''Palace of Pleasure'' in 1582.<ref>Keeble (1980: 18).</ref> Painter's version was part of a trend among writers and playwrights of the time to publish works based on Italian ''novelles''. At the time of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'', Italian tales were very popular among theatre patrons. Critics of the day even complained of how often Italian tales were borrowed to please crowds. Shakespeare took advantage of their popularity, as seen in his writing of both ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' (from Italian tales) and ''Romeo and Juliet''. Arthur Brooke's poem belonged to this trend, being a translation and adaptation of the Italian ''Giuletta e Romeo'', by [[Matteo Bandello]], included in his ''Novelle'' of 1554.<ref name = moore>Moore (1937: 38–44).</ref> Bandello's story was translated into French and was adapted by Italian theatrical troupes, some of whom performed in London at the time Shakespeare was writing his plays. Although nothing is known of the repertory of these troupes, it is possible that they performed some version of the story.<ref>Doran (1954: 132); Gibbons (1980: 32–33).</ref>

Bandello's version was an adaptation of [[Luigi da Porto]]'s ''Giulietta e Romeo'', included in his ''Istoria novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti'' (c. 1530).<ref name = moore/> The latter gave the story much of its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in [[Verona]], in the [[Veneto]].<ref name = Hosley>Hosley (1965: 168).</ref> Da Porto is probably also the source of the tradition that ''Romeo and Juliet'' is based on a true story.<ref name = "Gibbons 34">Gibbons (1980: 34).</ref> The names of the families (in Italian, the Montecchi and Capelletti) were actual 13th-century political factions.<ref>Moore (1930: 264–277).</ref> The tomb and balcony of Giulietta are still popular tourist spots in Verona, although scholars have disputed the assumption that the story actually took place.<ref name = "Gibbons 34"/> Before Da Porto, the earliest known version of the tale is the 1476 story of Mariotto and Gianozza of [[Siena]] by [[Masuccio Salernitano]], in ''[[Il Novellino]]'' (Novella XXXIII).<ref name = Hosley/>

''Romeo and Juliet'' borrows from a tradition of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these, [[Pyramus and Thisbe]], is thought by many scholars to have influenced da Porto's version. The former contains parallels to Shakespeare's story: the lovers' parents despise each other, and Pyramus' falsely believes his lover Thisbe is dead.<ref>Furness (1963).</ref> Brooke adjusted the Italian translation to reflect parts of Chaucer's ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''. The ''[[Ephesian Tale|Ephisiaca]]'' of [[Xenophon|Xenophon of Ephesus]], written in the [[third century]], also contains several similarities to the play, including the separation of the lovers, and a potion which induces a deathlike sleep. [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s ''[[Hero and Leander]]'' and ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage]]'', both similar stories written in Shakespeare's day, are thought to be less of a direct influence, although they may have created an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive.<ref>Gibbons, 36–37.</ref>

==Date and text== 
[[Image:Romeo and juliet title page.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Title page of the Second Quarto of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (published 1599)]] It is unknown when exactly Shakespeare wrote ''Romeo and Juliet''. Juliet's nurse refers to an earthquake which she says occurred eleven years ago<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': I.iii.23</ref>. An earthquake did occur in England in 1580, possibly dating that particular line to 1591. But the play's stylistic similarities with ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', as well as evidence of performances at the time (the play was becoming popular at around 1595), place the writing between 1595 and 1596. One widely-accepted conjecture has that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595–1596.<ref>Draper (1949: 55–57); Gibbons (1980: 26–31).</ref>

Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' was published in two distinct [[book size|quarto]] editions prior to the publication of the [[First Folio]] of 1623. These are referred to as [[First quarto|Q1]] and [[Second quarto|Q2]]. Q1, the first printed edition, appeared in 1597, printed by John Danter. Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labelled a '[[bad quarto]]'; the 20th century editor T. J .B. Spencer described it as "a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors.", suggesting that it had been pirated for publication.<ref name = Spencer>Spencer (1967: 284).</ref> An alternative explanation for Q1's shortcomings is that the play (like many others of the time) may have been heavily edited before performance by the playing company.<ref name = "Halio 1">Halio (1998: 1).</ref>

The superior [[Second quarto|Q2]] called the play ''The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet''. It was printed in 1599 by [[Thomas Creede]] and published by [[Cuthbert Burby]]. Q2 is about 800 lines longer than Q1.<ref name = "Halio 1"/> Its title page describes it as "Newly corrected, augmented and amended". Scholars believe that Q2 was based on Shakespeare's pre-performance draft, (called his [[foul papers]]), since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and "false starts" for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter. It is a much more complete and reliable text, and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5).<ref name = Spencer/> In effect, all later Quartos and Folios of ''Romeo and Juliet'' are based on Q2, as are all modern editions since editors believe that any deviations from Q2 in the later editions (whether good or bad) are likely to arise from editors or compositors, not from Shakespeare.<ref>Halio (1998: 2).</ref>

The [[First Folio]] text of 1623 was based primarily on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical promptbook or Q1.<ref name = Spencer/><ref>Gibbons (1980: 21).</ref> Other [[Folio]] editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4).<ref>Gibbons (1980: ix).</ref>  Modern versions considering several of the Folios and Quartos began printing with [[Nicholas Rowe|Nicholas Rowe's]] 1709 edition, followed by [[Alexander Pope|Alexander Pope's]] 1723 version.  Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into the Romantic period. Fully annotated editions first appeared in the Victorian period and continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play.<ref>Halio (1998: 8–9).</ref>

==Analysis and criticism==
[[Image:Johann Heinrich Füssli 060.jpg|right|thumb|Romeo at Juliet's Deathbed, by [[Johann Heinrich Füssli]]]]

===Critical history===

===Dramatic structure===
Shakespeare shows his dramatic skill freely in ''Romeo and Juliet'', providing intense moments of shift between comedy and tragedy. Before Mercutio's death in Act three, the play is largely a comedy.<ref>Shapiro (1964: 498–501)</ref> After his accidental demise, the play suddenly becomes very serious and takes on more of a tragic tone.  Still, the fact that Romeo is banished, rather than executed, offers a hope that things will work out. When Friar Lawrence offers Juliet a plan to reunite her with Romeo the audience still has a reason to believe that all will end well. They are in a "breathless state of suspense" by the opening of the last scene in the tomb: If Romeo is delayed long enough for the Friar to arrive, he and Juliet may yet be saved.<ref>Bonnard (1951: 319–327).</ref> This only makes it all the more tragic when everything falls apart in the end.<ref name = "Halio 20">Halio (1998: 20–30).</ref>

Shakespeare also uses subplots to offer a clearer view of the actions of the main characters, and provide an axis around which the main plot turns.  For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances.  Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious contrast to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the [[Subplot|sub-plot]] of the Montague-Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.<ref name = "Halio 20"/>

===Language===
Shakespeare uses a large variety of poetic forms throughout the play. He begins with a 14-line [[prologue]] in the form of a [[Shakespearean sonnet]], spoken by a Chorus.   Most of ''Romeo and Juliet'' is, however, written in [[blank verse]], and much of it in strict [[iambic pentameter]], with less rhythmic variation than in most of Shakespeare's later plays.<ref>Halio (1998: 51).</ref> In choosing forms, Shakespeare matches the poetry to the character who uses it. Friar Lawrence, for example, uses [[sermon]] and [[sententiae]] forms, and the Nurse uses a unique [[blank verse]] form that closely matches [[colloquial speech]].<ref>Halio (1998: 51).</ref> Each of these forms is also moulded and matched to the emotion of the scene the character occupies.  For example, when Romeo talks about Rosaline earlier in the play, he uses the [[Petrarchan sonnet]] form.  Petrarchan sonnets were often used by men at the time to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain, as in Romeo's situation with Rosaline.  This sonnet form is also used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as a handsome man.<ref>Halio (1998: 47-48).</ref> When Romeo and Juliet meet, the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan (which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare's day) to a then more contemporary sonnet form, using "pilgrims" and "saints" as metaphors.<ref>Halio (1998: 48–49).</ref> Finally, when the two meet on the balcony, Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love, but Juliet breaks it by saying "Dost thou love me?"<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': II.ii.90</ref> By doing this, she searches for true expression, rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love.<ref>Halio (1998: 49–50).</ref> Juliet uses monosyllabic words with Romeo, but uses formal language with Paris.<ref>Levin (1960: 3–11).</ref> Other forms in the play include an [[epithalamium]] by Juliet, a [[rhapsody]] in Mercutio's [[Queen Mab]] speech, and an [[elegy]] by Paris.<ref>Halio (1998: 51-52).</ref> Shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people in the play, though at times for other characters, such as Mercutio.<ref>Halio (1998: 52–55).</ref>

==Themes and motifs==
Scholars have found it extremely difficult to assign one specific, over-arching [[Theme (literature)|theme]] to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike,<ref name= "Bowling 208">Bowling (1949: 208–220).</ref> awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate.  None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found it is clear that the play is full of several small, thematic elements which intertwine in complex ways. Several of those which are most often debated by scholars are discussed below.<ref>Halio (1998: 65).</ref>

===Love===
[[Image:Romeo and Juliet.jpg|thumb|right|Romeo and Juliet statue in [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]].]]
''Romeo and Juliet'' is sometimes considered to have no unifying theme, save that of young love.<ref name= "Bowling 208"/> In fact, the characters in it have become emblems of all who die young for their lovers. Since it is such an obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play.<ref name = Honegger>Honegger (2006: 73–88).</ref>

On their first meeting, Romeo and Juliet use a form of communication recommended by many etiquette authors in Shakespeare's day: metaphor.  By using metaphors of saints and sins, Romeo was able to test Juliet's feelings for him in a non-threatening way. This method was recommended by [[Baldassare Castiglione]] (whose works had been translated into English by this time). He pointed out that if a man used a metaphor as an invitation, the woman could pretend she did not understand the man, and the man could take the hint and back away without losing his honour. Juliet, however, makes it clear that she is interested in Romeo by playing along with his metaphor. Later, in the balcony scene, Shakespeare has Romeo overhear Juliet's declaration of love for him.  In Brooke's version of the story, her declaration is done in her bedroom, alone. By bringing Romeo into the scene to eavesdrop, Shakespeare breaks from the normal sequence of courtship. Usually, a woman was required to play hard to get, to be sure that her suitor was sincere. Breaking this rule, however, serves to speed along the plot. The lovers are able to skip a lengthy part of wooing, and move on to plain talk about their relationship&mdash;developing into an agreement to be married after knowing each other for only one night.<ref name = Honegger/> In the final suicide scene, there is a contradiction in the message – in the Catholic religion, suicides are condemned to hell, whereas people who die to be with their loves under the "[[Courtly love|Religion of Love]]" are joined with their loves in paradise.  Romeo and Juliet's love seems to be expressing the "Religion of Love" view rather than the Catholic view.  Another point is that although their love is passionate, it is only consummated in marriage, which prevents them from losing the audience's sympathy.<ref>Siegel (1961: 371–392).</ref>

The play arguably equates love and sex with death. Throughout the story, both Romeo and Juliet, along with the other characters, fantasize about [[Death (personification)|it as a dark being]], often equating it with a lover. Capulet, for example, when he first discovers Juliet's (faked) death, describes it as having [[virginity|deflowered]] his daughter.<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': II.v.38–42</ref> Juliet later even compares Romeo to death in an erotic way.  One of the strongest examples of this in the play is in Juliet's suicide, when she says, grabbing Romeo's dagger, "O happy dagger! / ...This is thy sheath / there rust, and let me die." The dagger here can be a sort of [[phallus]] of Romeo, with Juliet being its sheath in death, a strong sexual symbol.<ref>MacKenzie (2007: 22–42).</ref>

===Fate and chance===
{{pquote|"O, I am fortune's fool!|Romeo (''Romeo and Juliet'': III.i.138)}}
Scholars are divided on the role of fate in the play.  No consensus exists on whether the characters are truly fated to die together no matter what, or whether the events take place by a series of unlucky chances. Arguments in favour of fate often refer to the description of the lovers as "star-cross'd".<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'', Prologue</ref> This phrase seems to hint that the stars have predetermined the lovers' future.<ref>Evans (1950: 841–865).</ref> Another scholar of the fate persuasion, Draper, points out the parallels between the Elizabethan belief in [[Humorism|humours]] and the main characters of the play (for example, Tybalt as a choleric). Interpreting the text in the light of the Elizabethan science of humourism reduces the amount of plot attributed to chance by modern audiences.<ref name= "Draper 16">Draper (1939: 16–34).</ref> Still, other scholars see the play as a mere series of unlucky chances—many to such a degree that they do not see it as a tragedy at all, but an emotional melodrama.<ref name="Draper 16"/> Nevo believes the high degree to which chance is stressed in the narrative makes Romeo and Juliet a "lesser tragedy" of happenstance, not of character.  For example, Romeo's challenging Tybalt is not impulsive, it is, after Mercutio's death, the expected action to take.  In this scene, Nevo reads Romeo as being aware of the dangers of flouting [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]], identity and commitments. He makes the choice to kill, not because of a [[tragic flaw]], but because of circumstance.<ref name="Nevo 241">Nevo (1969: 241–258).</ref>

===Light and dark===
{{pquote|"In ''Romeo and Juliet''...the dominating image is light, every form and manifestation of it; the sun, moon, stars, fire, lightning, the flash of gunpowder, and the reflected light of beauty and of love; while by contrast we have night, darkness, clouds, rain, mist, and smoke."|Caroline Spurgeon|<ref name="Parker 663">Parker (1968: 663–674).</ref>}}

Scholars have long noted Shakespeare's widespread use of light and dark [[imagery]] throughout the play. The light theme was initially taken to be "symbolic of the natural beauty of young love", an idea beginning in Caroline Spurgeon's work ''Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us,'' although the perceived meaning has since its publication branched in several directions.<ref name="Nevo 241"/><ref name="Parker 663"/> For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun,<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': II.ii</ref> brighter than a torch,<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': I.v.42</ref> a jewel sparkling in the night,<ref> ''Romeo and Juliet'': I.v.44–45</ref> and a bright angel among dark clouds.<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': II.ii.26–32</ref>  Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her "beauty makes / This vault a feasting presence full of light."<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': I.v.85–86</ref> Juliet describes Romeo as "day in night" and "Whiter than snow upon a raven's back."<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': III.ii.17–19</ref><ref>Halio (1998: 55–56).</ref> This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols—contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way.<ref name="Nevo 241"/> Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create [[Irony|dramatic irony]].  For example, Romeo and Juliet's love is a light in the midst of the darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness, while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the [[Ethical dilemma|moral dilemma]] facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers.  All characters now recognize their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love of Romeo and Juliet.<ref name="Parker 663"/> The "light" theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time, since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars.<ref name = Tanselle>Tanselle (1964: 349–361).</ref>

===Time===
{{pquote|"These times of woe afford no time to woo."|Paris (''Romeo and Juliet'': III.iv.8–9)}}
Time plays an important role in the language and plot of the play. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to maintain an imaginary world void of time in the face of the harsh realities that surround them. For instance, when Romeo attempts to swear his love to Juliet by the moon, Juliet tells him not to, as it is known to be inconstant over time, and she does not desire this of him. From the very beginning, the lovers are designated as "star-cross'd"<ref>Prologue</ref> referring to an [[astrology|astrologic]] belief which is heavily connected to time. Stars were thought to control the fates of men, and as time passed, stars would move along their course in the sky, also charting the course of human lives below. Romeo speaks of a foreboding he feels in the stars movements' early in the play, and when he learns of Juliet's death, he defies the stars' course for him.<ref>Muir (2005: 34–41).</ref><ref name= "Draper 16"/>

A "haste theme" can be considered as fundamental to the play.<ref name=Tanselle/> For example, the action of ''Romeo and Juliet'' spans a period of four to six days, in contrast to Brooke's poem's spanning nine months.  Scholars such as Tanselle believe that time was "especially important to Shakespeare" in this play, as he used references to "short-time" for the young lovers as opposed to references to "long-time" for the "older generation" to highlight "a headlong rush towards doom".<ref name =Tanselle/> Romeo and Juliet fight time to make their love to last forever. In the end, the only way they see to defeat time is through a noteworthy death which makes them immortal through art.<ref name=Lucking>Lucking (2001: 115–126).</ref>

Time is heavily connected to the theme of light and dark as well. The play is said in the Prologue to be about two hours long, creating a problem for any playwright wishing to express longer amounts of time.<ref name=Lucking/> In Shakespeare's day, plays were often performed at noon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion.  He also has characters frequently refer to  days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to this illusion of its passage.<ref>Halio (1998: 55–58); Driver (1964: 363–370).</ref>

==Context and interpretation==
===Psychoanalytic===
[[Psychoanalytic criticism|Psychoanalytic critics]] focus largely on Romeo's relationships with Rosaline and Juliet, as well as the looming image of inevitable death.<ref name ="Halio 81">Halio (1998: 81–87).</ref> ''Romeo and Juliet'' is not considered to be extremely psychologically complex, and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses.<ref>Appelbaum (1997: 251–272).</ref> The first line of criticism argues that Romeo is in love with Rosaline and Juliet because she is the all-present, all-powerful mother which fills a void. According to this theory, this void was caused by the negligence of his mother. Another theory argues that the feud between the families provides a source of phallic expression for the male Capulets and Montagues. This sets up a system where patriarchal order is in power. When the sons are married, rather than focusing on the wife, they are still owed an obligation to their father through the feud.  This conflict between obligation to the father (the family name) and the wife (the feminine), determines the course of the play. Some critics argue this hatred is the sole cause of Romeo and Juliet's passion for each other. The fear of death and the knowledge of the danger of their relationship is in this view channelled into a romantic passion.<ref name ="Halio 81"/>
[[Image:Romeo and Juliet with Friar Laurence - Henry William Bunbury.jpg|thumb|Feminist literary critics have pointed out Juliet's dependence on male characters, such as Friar Laurence and Romeo.]]

===Feminist===
[[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist critics]] argue that the blame for the family feud lies in Verona's [[patriarchal society]]. In this view, the strict, masculine code of violence imposed on Romeo is the main force driving the tragedy to its end.  When Tybalt kills Mercutio, for example, Romeo shifts into this violent mode, regretting that Juliet has made him so "effeminate".<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': III.i.112</ref> In this view, the younger males "become men" by engaging in violence on behalf of their fathers, or in the case of the servants, their masters.  The feud is also linked to male virility, as the joke about the maid's heads shows.<ref>Kahn (1977: 5–22).</ref> Juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others, such as the Friar, to solve her problems for her. Other critics, such as Dympna Callaghan, look at the play's [[feminism]] from a more [[historicist]] angle. They take into account the fact that the play is written during a time when the patriarchal order was being challenged by several forces, most notably the rise of [[Puritanism]]. When Juliet dodges her father's attempt to force her to marry a man she has no feeling for, she is successfully challenging the patriarchal order in a way that would not have been possible at an earlier time.<ref>Halio (1998: 87–92).</ref>

===Gender studies===
[[Gender studies|Gender studies critics]] largely question the sexuality of two characters, Mercutio and Romeo. From the perspective of this form of criticism, the difference between the two characters' friendship and sexual love is discussed heavily in the play. Mercutio's friendship with Romeo, for example, leads to several friendly conversations, including ones on the subject of Romeo's [[phallus]]. This would seem to suggest traces of [[homoeroticism]].<ref>Halio (1998: 85–87).</ref> Romeo, as well, admits traces of the same in the manner of his love for Rosaline and Juliet. Rosaline, for example, is distant and unavailable, bringing no hope of offspring.  As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate.  Shakespeare's [[procreation sonnets]] describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who is homosexual. Gender critics believe that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says "...that which we call a rose [or Rosaline] / By any other name would smell as sweet",<ref>''Romeo and Juliet'': II.ii.43–44. The [[First Folio]] replaces "name" with "word".</ref> she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.<ref>Goldberg (1994: 221–227).</ref>

==Influences==
''Romeo and Juliet'' has had a strong influence on subsequent literature. For example, until this play romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.<ref>Levenson (2000: 49–50).</ref> The play directly influenced several [[Literature|literary works]], both in Shakespeare's own day through the works of [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]],<ref>McKeithan (1970).</ref> and later works such as those of [[Charles Dickens]].<ref>Muir (2005: 352–362).</ref>

The play has also influenced world culture, specifically with regard to romance and relationships. For example, the word "Romeo" has become synonymous with "male lover" in English, especially one who goes to great lengths for love.<ref>"Romeo", Merriam-Webster Online</ref> The [[juliet cap]], worn either close to the scalp as a small headpiece or as a wedding headband to hold the [[bridal veil]], was so named because of the actresses who wore it on stage in performances of the play.<ref>Hollander (1993: 305).</ref><ref>"Juliet cap", [[Oxford English Dictionary]].</ref> It has inspired the name of a (later discredited<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-2445(199211)54%3A4%3C888%3ATIOPAF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H The Influence of Parents and Friends on the Quality and Stability of Romantic Relationships: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Investigation]</ref>) psychological problem between couples, called "the Romeo and Juliet Effect". This title is used to describe relationships which suffer divisions because of hatred between partners' parents.<ref>Hinde (1997: 441–442).</ref> More recently, scholars have described the play as having a unique adaptive and iconic ability, causing its characters to transcend the original texts and project themselves into the modern world. For example, Romeo and Juliet are mentioned in a song by [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] titled ''Romeo'', which portrays the Montague as a modern character pining for love in a modern way. Both characters have become symbols of love, teenage struggles, resistance to authority, and doers of the forbidden. Songs such as ''Romeo'' take advantage of the influence these characters have had by communicating through  them to achieve their ends.<ref>Reynolds & Segal (2005: 37–70).</ref>

==Performances and adaptations==

===Shakespeare's day===
''Romeo and Juliet'' ranks with ''[[Hamlet]]'' as one of Shakespeare's most-performed plays.<ref name = awesome/> Its many adaptations have made it one of his most enduring and famous stories.<ref name = awesome>Halio (1998: ix).</ref> Even in Shakespeare's lifetime it was extremely popular. Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare's plays, in the period after the death of [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[Thomas Kyd|Kyd]] but before the ascendancy of [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] during which Shakespeare was London's dominant playwright.<ref>Taylor (2002: 18). The five more popular plays, in descending order, are [[Henry VI, Part 1]], [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]], [[Hamlet]] and [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]</ref> The exact date of the first performance of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'', however, is unknown. The First Quarto, printed in 1597, says that "it hath been often (and with great applause) plaid publiquely", setting the first performance prior to that date. The [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] were certainly the first to perform it. Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare, the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors, [[William Kempe|Will Kemp]], instead of Peter in a line in Act five. [[Richard Burbage]] was probably the first Romeo, being the company's [[leading actor]], and Master Robert Goffe (a male) the first Juliet.<ref name="Halio 97"/>
[[Image:Mary Saunderson.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mary Saunderson]], probably the first woman to play Juliet professionally.]]

===The Restoration and the 18th century===
All theatres were closed down by the [[puritan]] government during the [[English Interregnum|Commonwealth]]. Upon the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]]) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them.<ref>Marsden (2002, 21)</ref> Sir [[William Davenant]] of the Duke's Company staged a 1662 production in which [[Henry Harris]] played Romeo, [[Thomas Betterton]] was Mercutio, and Betterton's wife [[Mary Saunderson]] played Juliet: probably the first woman to play the role professionally.<ref>Van Lennep (1965).</ref><ref name = "Halio 100">Halio (1998: 100–102).</ref> This play was criticized by [[Samuel Pepys]] as the worst he had ever heard. Versions immediately following this were changed to tragicomedies, where the two lovers did not die in the end.<ref name="Halio 100"/> For example, [[Thomas Otway]]'s adaptation ''The History and Fall of Caius Marius'', one of the more extreme of the Restoration versions of Shakespeare, debuted in 1680. The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to [[ancient Rome]]; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebeians; Juliet/Lavinia wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway's version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. It altered the sexual language of the play as well, toning down the [[Queen Mab]] speech, for example.<ref name="Halio 100"/> [[Theophilus Cibber]] mounted his own adaptation in 1744, followed by [[David Garrick]]'s in 1748. Both Cibber and Garrick used variations on Otway's innovation in the tomb scene.<ref>Marsden (2002: 26–27).</ref> These versions also eliminated elements deemed inappropriate for the time. For example, Garrick's version transferred all language describing Rosaline to Juliet, in order to heighten the idea of faithfulness and downplay the love-at-first-sight theme.<ref>Branam (1984: 170–179); Stone (1964: 191–206).</ref>  In 1750 a "Battle of the Romeos" began, with [[Spranger Barry]] and [[Susannah Maria Arne]] (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] versus [[David Garrick]] and [[George Anne Bellamy]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].<ref>Pedicord (1954: 14).</ref>

===19th century theatre===
[[Image:Charlotte Cushman Susan Cushman Romeo Juliet 1846.jpg|thumb|right|The American Cushman sisters, [[Charlotte Saunders Cushman|Charlotte]] and Susan, as Romeo and Juliet in [[1846]]]]
Garrick's altered version of the play was very popular, and ran for nearly a century.<ref name="Halio 100"/> Not until 1845 did Shakespeare's original return to the stage in the United States (with the sisters [[Charlotte Saunders Cushman|Charlotte]] and Susan Cushman as Romeo and Juliet),<ref>[[Charlotte Saunders Cushman]] played Romeo 54 years before [[Sarah Bernhardt]] played Hamlet.</ref><ref>Gay (2002: 162).</ref> and in 1847 in Britain ([[Samuel Phelps]] at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]).<ref>Halliday (1964: 125, 365, 420).</ref> Cushman actively reverted Garrick's additions and changes to the original, and adhered to Shakespeare's version, beginning a string of eighty-four performances. Her portrayal of Romeo was considered genius by many, as she called more attention to Romeo's character than other's, making the play largely his tragedy. Cushman's success broke the Garrick tradition and paved the way for later plays.<ref name="Halio 100"/> [[Henry Irving]]'s 1882 production at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] is considered an archetype of his "pictorial" style, placing the action on elaborate sets. Irving himself played Romeo, and [[Ellen Terry]] played Juliet.<ref>Scooch (2002: 62–63).</ref> In 1895, actor [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson|Forbes-Robertson]] took over for Irving, and laid the groundwork for a more natural portrayal of Shakespeare that remains popular today. Forbes-Robertson avoided the showiness of Irving and instead portrayed a down-to-earth Romeo, expressing the poetic dialogue as realistic prose and avoiding melodramatic flourish. Meanwhile, American theatres began performing the play, eventually rivalling their British counterparts with the likes of [[Edwin Booth]] (brother to [[John Wilkes Booth]]) and [[Mary McVicker]] as Romeo and Juliet. The play found popularity throughout continental Europe, as well.<ref>Halio (1998: 104–105).</ref>

===20th century theatre===
[[Image:Gielgud.jpeg|thumb|left|[[John Gielgud]] among the more famous 20th-century actors to play Romeo, Friar Laurence and Mercutio on stage]]
In one of the most notable 20th-century performances, staged by [[John Gielgud]] at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] in 1935, Gielgud and [[Laurence Olivier]] played the roles of Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six weeks into the run, with [[Peggy Ashcroft]] as Juliet.<ref>Smallwood (2002: 102).</ref> Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts, omitting only minor portions of the originals, such as the second Chorus.  He also organized the set and costumes to match as closely as possible to the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan period]].  His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical [[realism]] in later plays.<ref>Halio (1998: 105-107).</ref> Meanwhile, [[Peter Brook|Peter Brook's]] 1947 version was the beginning of a different style of ''Romeo and Juliet'' performances. Brook was less concerned with realism, and more concerned with translating the play into a form that could communicate with the more modern world. He argued, "A production is only correct at the moment of its correctness, and only good at the moment of its success."<ref name="Halio 107">Halio (1998: 107–109).</ref> Other notable 20th-century productions include [[Guthrie McClintic|Guthrie McClintic's]] [[1934]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] staging in which [[Katharine Cornell]] had a triumph as Juliet opposite [[Basil Rathbone]] as Romeo and [[Edith Evans]] (who also played the role in the [[John Gielgud|Gielgud]] production) as the Nurse. Cornell later revived the production with [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] as Romeo and [[Ralph Richardson]] as Mercutio, both making their [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debuts. [[Franco Zeffirelli]] mounted a legendary staging for the [[Old Vic]] in 1960 with [[John Stride]] and [[Judi Dench]] that served as the basis for his [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|1968 film]].<ref>Levenson (2000: 87).</ref> Zeffirelli borrowed from Brook's ideas, altogether removing nearly a third of the play's text in order to make it more accessible to a contemporary audience. He also paid close attention to detail, making sure that nothing which would add to the realism of the performance was neglected. Zeffirelli's performances were so successful worldwide that he made a film of the play in 1968.<ref name="Halio 107"/>
More recent professional performances have grown more and more adaptive to the contemporary world. For example, the prestigious [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] developed a 1986 version of the play set in present-day Verona, Italy. Switchblades replace swords, feasts and balls become drug-laden rock parties, and Romeo commits suicide by [[hypodermic needle]].<ref>Halio (1998: 110).</ref> Later, in 1997, the [[Folger Shakespeare Theatre]] produced another modern version, this time set in a typical suburban world. Romeo sneaks into the Capulet barbecue to meet Juliet, and Juliet discovers Tybalt's death while in class at school.<ref>Halio (1998: 110–112).</ref> Other contemporary performances give the play a well-known historical setting, enabling audiences to understand, and perhaps to reflect upon, the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set in the midst of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]],<ref>Pape (1997: 69).</ref> in the [[apartheid]] era in [[South Africa]],<ref>Quince (2000: 121–125).</ref> and in the aftermath of the [[Pueblo Revolt]].<ref>Klugman (2007).</ref> Among the most famous of such adaptations is [[Peter Ustinov]]'s 1956 comic adaptation, [[Romanoff and Juliet]], set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the [[Cold War]].<ref>Taylor (1962: 18).</ref>

[[Image:KasarvinaLifarRG2.jpg|thumb|left|Several ballet versions of the play have developed, including this one starring Tamara Kasarvina and Serge Lifar.]]

===Ballet, opera and musicals===
At least 24 [[opera]]s have been based on Romeo and Juliet.<ref>Meyer (1968: 36–38).</ref>  The earliest, ''Romeo und Julie'' (1776), a [[Singspiel]] by [[Georg Benda]], omits much of the action of the play and most its characters, and has a happy ending.  It is occasionally revived.  The best-known is [[Charles Gounod|Gounod's]] ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'' (1867, libretto by [[Jules Barbier]] and [[Michel Carré]]<ref>Sadie (1992: 31).</ref>), a critical triumph when first performed<ref>Holden (1993: 393).</ref> and frequently revived today.  [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini's]] ''[[I Capuleti e i Montecchi]]'' is also revived from time to time, but has sometimes been judged unfavourably because of its perceived liberties with Shakespeare; however, Bellini and his librettist, [[Felice Romani]], worked from Italian sources – principally Romani's libretto for an opera by [[Nicola Vaccai]] – rather than directly adapting Shakespeare's play.<ref>Collins (1982: 532–538).</ref>

The play has also had a number of [[musical theatre]] adaptations, the most famous of which is ''[[West Side Story]]'' with music by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]]. It débuted on Broadway in 1957 and in London's West End in 1958, and became a popular film in 1961. This version updated the setting to mid-20th century [[New York City]], and the warring families to ethnic gangs.<ref name="Rodriguez 74">Rodriguez (1997: 74).</ref> Other musical adaptations include [[Terrence Mann]]'s 1999 rock musical ''William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet'', co-written with Jerome Korman,<ref>Ehren (1999)</ref> [[Gérard Presgurvic]]'s 2001 ''[[Roméo et Juliette, de la Haine à l'Amour]]'' and [[Riccardo Cocciante]]'s 2007 ''[[Giulietta e Romeo (musical)|Giulietta & Romeo]]''.<ref>Arafay (2005: 186).</ref>

Several [[ballet]] versions have also been composed; the best-known is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev's]] ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', first performed in 1938.<ref>Nestyev (1960: 261).</ref> This version is perhaps the most well known story ballet still performed to this day.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} This Stalin-approved version is dramatically different than what Prokofiev originally intended to create.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

[[Roméo et Juliette (symphony)|Roméo et Juliette]] by [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] is a "symphonie dramatique", a large scale work in three parts for mixed voices, chorus and orchestra, premiered in 1839.<ref>Bloom (2000: 178).</ref> [[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|The Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture]] (1869, revised 1870 and 1880), by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] is a long [[symphonic poem]], containing the famous melody known as the "love theme".<ref>Stites (1995: 5).</ref>

===Screen===

{{main|Romeo and Juliet on screen}}

<!--This is a SUMMARY. Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main film article [[Romeo and Juliet on screen]]!-->
Shakespeare's play has been filmed numerous times.<ref>Internet Movie Database</ref> In putting Romeo and Juliet on [[Shakespeare on screen|screen]], the director must set the action in a [[Social environment|social context]] that illuminates the characters, and mediates between the Renaissance play and modern audiences.<ref name="Tatsbaugh">Tatspaugh (2000: 135–136).</ref> [[George Cukor]], in 1970, commented on why his "stately" and "stodgy" [[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|1936 film]] had not stood the test of time, saying that if he had the opportunity to make it again he would "get the garlic and the Mediterranean into it".<ref name="Tatsbaugh"/> Yet that performance (featuring [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], with a combined age over 75, as the teenage lovers) had garnered no fewer than four [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations.<ref name="Tatsbaugh"/>

The films' openings highlight each director's care to establish authenticity: Cukor introduces his characters in a shot of a scene played on a [[proscenium]] stage; [[Renato Castellani]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (1954 film)|1954 version]] opens with [[John Gielgud]], famous as a stage Romeo, as the Prologue in Elizabethan doublet and hose; Zeffirelli sets his scene with an overview of Verona, and his Prologue, in voiceover, was another famous stage Romeo: [[Laurence Olivier]]. In contrast, ''[[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet|Romeo + Juliet]]'' in 1996 was targeted at a young audience, and opens with images of television and print journalism.<ref name="Tatsbaugh"/>

A particular difficulty for the screen-writer arises towards the end of the fourth act, where Shakespeare's play requires considerable compression to be effective on the big screen, without giving the impression of "cutting to the chase".<ref name="Jackson 30">Jackson (2000: 30–31).</ref> In [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|1968 version]], Juliet's return home from the Friar's cell, her submission to her father and the preparation for the wedding are drastically abbreviated, and similarly the tomb scene is cut short: Paris does not appear at all, and Benvolio (in the Balthazar role) is sent away but is not threatened.<ref name="Jackson 30"/> In [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet|Romeo + Juliet]]'', the screenplay allows Juliet to witness Romeo's death, and the role of the watch is cut, permitting Friar Lawrence to remain with Juliet and to be taken by surprise by her sudden suicide.<ref name="Jackson 30"/>

In addition, several re-workings of the story have also been filmed. ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998) tells the story of how Shakespeare came up with the play, placing him in the midst of his own tragic romance as he writes it. The movie creates other parallels to the play as well, such as a quarrel between two playhouses, The Curtain and [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose]], and an antagonist with similarities to both Count Paris and Tybalt.<ref>Palmer (2003: 61–76).</ref> ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'' (2000) uses elements of the plot to introduce [[Jet Li]] to an American audience, with Asian Americans as Montagues and African Americans as Capulets.<ref>Kim (2004: 150–179).</ref> Disney's ''[[High School Musical]]'' (2006), also loosely adapts the ''Romeo and Juliet'' story, placing the two young lovers in rival high school cliques instead of feuding families.<ref>Daily Mail {{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=404621&in_page_id=1773 |date=2006 |title=Disney's teenage musical 'phenomenon' premieres in London |accessdate=2007-08-19 |date=11 |year=2006 |month=September |work=Daily Mail}}</ref>
