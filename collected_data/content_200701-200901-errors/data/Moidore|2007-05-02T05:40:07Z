A '''moidore''' is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[gold coin]], minted from [[1640]] to [[1732]].  The moidore was [[currency|current]] in [[western Europe]] and the [[West Indies]], particularly [[Barbados]], for a long period after it ceased to be struck. It was the principal coin current in [[Ireland]] at the beginning of the [[18th century]], and spread to the west of [[England]].

The name ''moidore'' is derived from Portuguese ''moeda de ouro'', which literally meant "golden coin".

There is reference to the moidore in the [[John Masefield]] poem 'Cargoes' - 'Stately Spanish galleon coming from the Isthmus - Dipping through the tropics by the palm green shores, With a cargo of diamonds, emeralds, amythysts, topazes, and cinnamon, and gold moidores.'
