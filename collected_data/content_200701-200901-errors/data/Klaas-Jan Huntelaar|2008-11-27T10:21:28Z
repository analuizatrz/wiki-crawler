[[Image:Van basten huntelaar.jpg|thumb|left|Huntelaar (right) with Netherlands coach [[Marco van Basten]] during a training prior to Euro 2008.]]
Huntelaar was [[scout]]ed as a youth talent by [[Go Ahead Eagles]] but the distance required to travel to the team's base in [[Deventer]] prohibited him from joining the club.<ref name="officialbio"/> Soon after he was scouted by [[De Graafschap]] where on April 6, 1994 he signed his first youth contract, aged eleven.<ref name="officialbio"/> During his first two years with De Graafschap, Huntelaar played as a left back, left winger, attacking midfielder, and even as a goalkeeper; only in his third year was he deployed as a striker.<ref name="officialbio"/> In the 1997–98 season, the 14 year old Huntelaar was the first striker for the C-team at De Graafschap, and scored 33 goals in 20 matches.<ref name="officialbio"/> The following season saw him promoted to the B1 team, and in the 1999–00 season he became top scorer of the B1 league with 31 goals.<ref name="officialbio"/> His goal-scoring abilities drew the attention of [[PSV Eindhoven]], who signed him in June 2000.<ref name="officialbio"/>

Huntelaar is a [[striker]] who plays as a centre forward, or an "out-and-out" striker, rather than as a supporting striker. He has a good technical ability and can score goals with his head and with either foot. He has been compared in playing style to [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Fernando Morientes]].<ref name="UEFA profile">{{cite web | title= Huntelaar class shines through | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=512/newsId=383257.html |date=[[2006-01-13]]| accessdate=2007-10-15 }}</ref><ref name="UEFA2">{{cite web | title= Huntelaar follows Van Basten | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=1/newsid=679712.html |date=[[2008-04-04]]| accessdate=2008-04-07 }}</ref>
