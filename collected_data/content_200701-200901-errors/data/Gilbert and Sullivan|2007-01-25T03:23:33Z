[[Librettist]] '''[[W. S. Gilbert]]''' (1836&ndash;1911) and [[composer]] '''[[Arthur Sullivan]]''' (1842&ndash;1900) collaborated on a series of fourteen [[comic opera]]s in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[England]] between 1871 and 1896.

The Gilbert and Sullivan works have enjoyed broad and enduring international success, particularly in the English-speaking world.  ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', in particular, introduced innovations in content and form that directly influenced the [[musical theatre]] of the 20th century.<ref name=PeterDowns>[http://www.courant.com/news/local/sr/hc-nightlife1018.artoct18,0,5133892.story?coll=hc-headlines-sr  Peter Downs' ''Actors Cast Away Cares', on courant.com], downloaded [[30 October]] [[2006]]</ref>  Their works have become known as the [[Savoy Opera]]s, after the [[Savoy Theatre]] in [[London]], which was built in 1881 by their producer, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], to present their operas.<ref>[http://www.thisistheatre.com/londontheatre/savoytheatre.html Information about the Savoy Theatre]</ref> 

Gilbert, who wrote the words, created fanciful worlds for these operas, where an absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion.  In these worlds fairies rub elbows with English lords, flirting is a capital offense, gondoliers ascend to the monarchy, and pirates turn out to be noblemen who have gone wrong.  The lyrics employ double (and triple) rhyming and punning, and served as a model for such 20th century [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] lyricists as [[P.G.

Note the quote from [[George Grove]]. (Downloaded [[30 October]] [[2006]])</ref>

Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two &ndash; Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict.  In addition, Gilbert imbued his [[libretto|libretti]] with "topsy-turvy" situations in which the social order was turned upside down.  After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.<ref>See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3</ref>  In addition, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at those in the circles of privilege, while Sullivan was eager to socialize among the wealthy and titled people who would become his friends and patrons.<ref>See, e.g. Jacobs, Arthur (1992); Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html The Life of W.S. Gilbert]; and Bond, Jessie, [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/bond/chapter16_txt.htm Chapter 16]</ref>

For over a century, until it closed in 1982, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] performed the Gilbert and Sullivan operas (controlling the British copyrights to the works until 1961) and exercised great influence over the style and traditions for performing these works.  Today, many cities, churches, schools, and universities have their own amateur Gilbert and Sullivan performing groups.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html List of amateur G&S performing societies]</ref>  The most popular G&S works are also performed from time to time by major opera companies,<ref>[http://www.operabase.com/oplist.cgi?id=none&lang=en&is=&by=Sullivan&loc=&stype=abs&sd=30&sm=10&sy=2005&etype=abs&ed=31&em=10&ey=2007 List of recent G&S productions at major opera companies]</ref> and there are a number of professional repertory companies that specialize in G&S.<ref>e.g., [[NYGASP]], [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]],  Somerset Opera, [[Opera della Luna]], [[Opera a la Carte]], [[Skylight opera theatre]], [[Ohio Light Opera]], and [[Washington Savoyards]]</ref>  In addition, every summer, there is a 3-week long [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]] in [[Buxton|Buxton, England]].

[[Image:Gentle Alice Brown.jpg|thumb|200px|One of Gilbert's illustrations for his [[Bab Ballads|Bab Ballad]] "Gentle Alice Brown"]]Gilbert was born on [[November 18]], [[1836]].  His father [[William Gilbert (author)|William]] was a naval surgeon who later became a novelist and short story writer.<ref name=CrowtherLife>Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html ''The Life of W. S. Gilbert'']</ref>  Gilbert illustrated some of his father's stories,<ref name=CrowtherLife /> and in 1861, he began to write illustrated stories, poems and articles of his own to supplement his income. The poems, published as the [[Bab Ballads]], and the short stories would later be mined as a source of ideas for his later plays, including the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.<ref>Stedman (1996), pp. 26-29, 123-4, and the introduction to Gilbert's ''[[Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales]].</ref>  In the Bab Ballads, Gilbert had developed a unique "topsy-turvy" style, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd.  Gilbert had already produced half of his 75 plays and operas by 1871, and he also was an innovator in the art of stage direction, following theatrical reformer [[Tom Robertson]].

Theatre at that time Gilbert began writing was in disrepute,<ref>Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/introduction.htm Introduction.]. Bond created the mezzo-soprano roles in most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and is here leading in to a description of Gilbert's role reforming the Victorian theatre.</ref> and Gilbert helped to reform and elevate the respectability of the theatre, especially beginning with his six family-friendly [[German Reed Entertainments]].<ref>Stedman (1996) pp 62-68; Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/introduction.htm Introduction.], etc.</ref> At a rehearsal for ''[[Ages Ago]]'' in 1869, one of these entertainments, composed by [[Frederic Clay]], Clay introduced Gilbert to [[Arthur Sullivan]].<ref name=CrowtherAgesAgo>Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html Analysis of Ages Ago]</ref> Two years later, they would create their first collaboration together.

===Sullivan before Gilbert===
:''For more information, see [[Arthur Sullivan]]''
[[Image:Crystal Palace.PNG|thumb|right|200px|The Crystal Palace, where several early Sullivan works premiered]]Sullivan was born in London on [[May 13]] [[1842]].  His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of 8, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band.  In school he began to compose [[anthem]]s and songs, and in 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn prize and studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and at [[Leipzig]], where he also took up [[conducting]].  His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a set of incidental music to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]''. Revised and expanded, it was performed at [[the Crystal Palace]] in 1862 and was an immediate sensation.  He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto and his successful ''[[Overture di Ballo]]'', in 1870.

His early works for the voice included ''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]'' (1864); an [[oratorio]], ''The Prodigal Son'' (1869); a dramatic cantata, ''On Shore and Sea'' (1871); and a [[song cycle]], ''The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens'' (1871).  He also composed a ballet, ''L'Île Enchantée'' and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays.  
These commissions were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat during this period.  He also worked as a church organist and composed numerous [[hymn]]s, including "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]" (1872), popular songs and [[parlour ballads]].  Sullivan's first successful opera was ''[[Cox and Box]]'' (1866), followed by ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (1867), both with librettos by [[Francis Cowley Burnand|F. C. Burnand]].

==The Gilbert and Sullivan operas==
===First collaborations: ''Thespis'' and ''Trial by Jury''===
The first Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration was ''[[Thespis (operetta)|Thespis]]'', produced at the large [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], an extravaganza in which the gods of the classical world, who have become elderly and ineffective, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of actors and actresses.  The piece mocked [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''Orpheus in the Underworld'' and ''La Belle Hélène'', which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.  ''Thespis'' opened at the Gaiety Theatre on [[Boxing Day]] in 1871 and ran for 63 performances. Gilbert directed the production himself, as he did all of the G&S operas.  Unlike the later G&S works, however, ''Thespis'' was hastily prepared and of a more risqué nature, like Gilbert's earlier [[travesty|travesties]], with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors.  Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned.  The musical score to ''Thespis'' was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and the Act II ballet.  There have been numerous revivals, either with original scores or adaptations of Sullivan's other music. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/thespis/html/thespis_home.html]

''Thespis'' outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season and was later revived for a benefit performance.  No one at the time, however, anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration, and Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together for another four years.  Gilbert worked with Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872), and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), as well as writing several other operetta libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas, adaptations from novels, and translations from the French.  Sullivan also was not idle.  He completed his ''Festival [[Te Deum]]'' (1872), another oratorio, ''The Light of the World'' (1873), his only [[song cycle]] ''The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens'' (1871), incidental music to ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1874) and more [[hymn]]s, including "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]" (1872), songs and parlour ballads.  In short, during these years, each man became more eminent in his field.
 
By early 1875, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] was managing the [[Royalty Theatre]], and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Périchole]]''.  Gilbert had already written such a short piece on commission from producer-composer [[Carl Rosa]], whose wife's unexpected death had left the libretto an orphan.  Carte suggested that it be set to music by Sullivan.  Sullivan was delighted with it, and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was composed in a matter of weeks.  The little piece, starring Sullivan's brother, [[Fred Sullivan|Fred]], as the Learned Judge, was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of ''La Périchole'' and being revived at another theatre.<ref>Walbrook, H. M. (1922), [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/walbrook/chap3.html ''Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, a History and Comment''(Chapter 3)]. See also Barker, John W. [http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.html "Gilbert and Sullivan"], which quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of ''Trial by Jury'' to him: "As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time."</ref>

===The triumvirate: ''Sorcerer'' through ''Pirates''===
[[Image:Sorc-Pin-Trial.jpg|thumb|400px|An early poster showing their first three operas after Thespis.]]
''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877) was the first full-length example of what came to be known as the [[Savoy Operas]] (although the Savoy Theatre had yet to be built).  Carte, who was now interested in developing an English form of light opera that would displace the French works then dominating the London stage, asked Gilbert for a comic opera that would serve as the centerpiece for an evening's entertainment. Gilbert found a subject in one of his short stories, "The Elixir of Love", which concerned a [[Cockney]] businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular).  Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that ''The Sorcerer'' opened as a fully polished production, in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed ''Thespis''. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/sorcerer/html/index.html]  The triumvirate of Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte was now an established entity that would survive through a dozen more collaborations.

With ''The Sorcerer'', the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system came into being. Previously, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with ''Thespis''. From ''The Sorcerer'' onwards, Gilbert would no longer hire stars; he would create them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars. Gilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage. Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation.  The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre. 

The libretto of ''The Sorcerer'' relied on [[stock character]] types, many of which were familiar from European opera: the heroic protagonist ([[tenor]]) and his love-interest ([[soprano]]); the elderly woman with fading charms ([[contralto]]) and a supporting [[bass-baritone]] or two.  The "patter" or comic [[baritone]], was often the leading role of their comic operas.  This character most often gets to sing the speedy [[patter song]]s.  Gilbert and Sullivan also fully integrated the male and female choruses into the action, making them, collectively, as important as any principal character. 

The repertory system ensured that the comic patter man who would perform the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', then join the army as Major-General Stanley in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in ''The Sorcerer'' would transform into Little Buttercup in ''Pinafore'', then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in ''Pirates''.  Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged for ''The Sorcerer'' and ''Pinafore'' would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage.  These included [[George Grossmith]], the comic baritone; [[Rutland Barrington]], lyric baritone and character actor; [[Richard Temple]], the bass-baritone; [[Jessie Bond]], the soubrette; and [[Rosina Brandram]] the contralto.

Gilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878), satirizing incompetent government officials, the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status. Dozens of unauthorized, or "pirated", productions of this work appeared in America.  ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1879), written in a fit of pique at [[United States|American]] [[copyright]] pirates, also poked fun at opera conventions, sense of duty, family obligation, and the relevance of a liberal education.

===Savoy Theatre: ''Patience'' to ''Gondoliers''===
''[[Patience (operetta)|Patience]]'' (1881) satirized the [[aesthetic movement]] in general, and the poet and aesthete [[Algernon Swinburne]] in particular, as well as male vanity and chauvinism in the military.  During the run of ''Patience'', Carte opened the [[Savoy Theatre]], which became the partnership's permanent home.  It was the first theatre (indeed the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting.<ref>[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SavoyTheatre.htm Savoy Theatre history]</ref>  ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882) was the first of their works to open at the Savoy. It poked fun at English law and the [[House of Lords]] and made much of the war between the sexes. ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884) spoofed women's education and male chauvinism.

In 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre, so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study.  Gilbert had referred to the new technology in ''Pinafore'' in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service.  Sullivan also installed a telephone at his home, and on [[May 13]] [[1883]], at a party to celebrate the composer's 41st birthday, the guests, including the Prince of Wales (later [[Edward VII]]), heard a direct relay of parts of ''Iolanthe'' from the Savoy.  According to [[Ian C. Bradley]], this was probably the first live "broadcast" of an opera.<ref>Bradley (1996), p. 176.</ref>

[[Image:The_Mikado_Three_Little_Maids.jpg|thumb|right|Lithograph from the Mikado]]The most successful of the Savoy Operas was ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy in a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] setting. ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), a topsy-turvy take on Victorian [[melodrama]], was less successful. ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888), their only joint work with a serious ending, concerns a pair of strolling players&mdash;a jester and a singing girl&mdash;who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the [[Tower of London]]. ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889) was a recapitulation of many of the themes of the earlier operas, taking place in a kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of "republican equality." [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gondoliers/html/index.html]

===The carpet quarrel===
Gilbert and Sullivan quarreled several times over the choice of a subject.  After both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore'', which were less successful than the seven other operas from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' through ''The Gondoliers'', Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him.  While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works.  On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.<ref>Crowther, Andrew, [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html The Carpet Quarrel Explained].</ref>

During the run of ''The Gondoliers'', however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:

:After all, the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May, 1891, a year after the end of the "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone."<ref name=Carpet>Crowther, Andrew, [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html The Carpet Quarrel Explained]</ref>

Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building a theatre in London for the production of new English grand operas, with Sullivan's ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' as the inaugural work. While the protracted quarrel worked itself out in the courts and in public, Gilbert wrote ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'' with [[Alfred Cellier]] and the flop ''[[Haste to the Wedding]]'' with [[George Grossmith]],<ref name=PlayList>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/html/other_gilbert.html List of Gilbert's Plays at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive]</ref> and Sullivan wrote ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' with Sidney Grundy, in addition to ''Ivanhoe''. 

In 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair and their producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, [[William Chappell|Tom Chappell]], stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded.<ref>Wolfson, p. 7.</ref>

===Last works and legacy===
[[Image:Utopia Limited Poster.jpg|thumb|500px|The Drawing Room Scene from Act II of Utopia.]]
''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896) was an outright failure.<ref>Wolfson, passim</ref> Neither work entered the "canon" of regularly-performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s.  Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'', 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting [[Nancy McIntosh]], his protegée from ''Utopia'', led to Sullivan's refusal.<ref> Wolfson, pp. 61-65.</ref>

After ''The Grand Duke'', the partners saw no reason to work together again. Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died four years later, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), and ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901) (finished by [[Edward German]] after Sullivan's death).

Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. He wrote only one more comic opera, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' ([[1909]]; music by [[Edward German]]), which was not a success.  

[[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] died in 1901, and his widow, [[Helen D'Oyly Carte|Helen]], and then his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], followed by his granddaughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte|Bridget]], continued to direct the activities of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which staged revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas until it closed in 1982.  With the success of the operas, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company were<!--British usage--> able to license the works to other professional companies, such as the [[J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company]], and to amateur societies.  For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired in 1961, and even after their expiration, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide and produced attractive recordings of the operas, helping to keep them popular through the decades.  Today, numerous repertory companies, opera companies and amateur societies continue to produce the works.

==Cultural influence==
===Songs and parodies===
The works of Gilbert and Sullivan, filled as they are with parodies of their contemporary culture, are themselves frequently parodied or pastiched; a notable example of this is [[Tom Lehrer]]'s [[The Elements (song)|The Elements]], which consists of Lehrer's rhyming rendition of the names of all the chemical elements set to the music of ''[[Major-General's Song]]'' from ''The Pirates of Penzance''. Lehrer also includes a verse parodying a Gilbert and Sullivan finale in his patchwork of stylistic creations ''Clementine'' ("full of words and music and signifying nothing", as Lehrer put it, thus parodying G&S and [[Shakespeare]] in the same sentence).

From ''The Pirates of Penzance'', "With cat-like tread" includes a segment that starts, "Come, friends who plough the sea...."  This tune is used for the popular modern song, "Hail, hail, the gang's all here"

[[Allan Sherman]] sang several parodies of Gilbert and Sullivan:
*I'm called Little Butterball (about Sherman's admitted corpulence, based on a song from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'')
*When I was a lad I went to Yale (about a young advertising agent, based on the patter song from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'')
*You need an analyst, a psychoanalyst (a variant on "I've got a little list" from ''The Mikado'')
*Titwillow (about a Yiddish-talking bird that meets a sad fate, and based on the song from ''The Mikado'' with the same title)

[[Anna Russell]] performed a [[parody]] called "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera."

===Literature===
In "[[Runaround]]", a short story in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[I, Robot]]'', [[Powell and Donovan]] encounter a robot who, while in a state similar to drunkeness, sings snippets of "There Grew a Little Flower (from "Ruddigore"), "I'm Called Little Buttercup" (from "Pinafore"), "When I First Put This Uniform On" (from "Patience"), and The Nightmare Song (from "Iolanthe").  Asimov, who was a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, wrote other stories with reference to their operas, including one which revolved around a time-traveler saving the score to ''Thespis''.

[[P. G. Wodehouse]] makes dozens of references to Gilbert and Sullivan in his works.<ref>See [http://home.lagrange.edu/arobinson/wodehousegilbert.htm this extensive list of P. G. Wodehouse references to G&S]</ref>

===Film===
*[[Mike Leigh]]'s film ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]'' (1999) is an acclaimed film depiction of the team and the creation of their most popular opera, ''The Mikado''.

*The score of the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981) draws heavily on the G&S repertoire.

*In [[Curtis Hanson]]'s film ''[[The Hand That Rocks The Cradle]]'' (1992), the score includes  songs from several Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

*In the ninth [[Star Trek]] feature film, ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' (1998), the characters Captain Picard, Worf and Data sing "A British Tar" from ''H.M.S. Pinafore''.

*In [[Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney's]] cartoon ''Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers'' (2004), the finale where Mickey saves Princess Minnie and Daisy is set at the Paris Opera House where a performance is being held based on the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. The songs used are: "With Cat Like Tread", "The Major General's Song", "Poor Wandering One", and from Princess Ida the beginning of the Overture

* In the movie ''[[Kate and Leopold]]'', there are multiple references made to ''The Pirates of Penzance'' including a scene where Leopold sings "I Am The Very Model of A Modern Major General" and accompanies himself on the piano.

* In the movie ''[[The Good Shepherd]]'', Matt Damon's character sings Little Buttercup's song falsetto in an all-male version of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' at Yale University.

*The character Sallah in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981) sings ''Pinafore'' tunes when he is excited or overjoyed.

===Television===
*The TV series "[[Magnum, P.I.]]" featured an episode in its fourth season titled "Let the Punishment Fit the Crime" featuring the Mikado number "Three Little Girls from School."

*[[Larry David]]'s show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' uses ''Three Little Maids'' from ''The Mikado'' as background music.

*The Season 3 Finale of the computer-animated cartoon ''[[ReBoot]]'' featured a parody of the Modern Major General song performed by sprite actors pretending to be the actual cast from reboot, using the music to retell the saga.

*The TV show [[The Simpsons]] has referenced Gilbert & Sullivan in several episodes. In the episode "[[Cape Feare]]", [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] asks [[Sideshow Bob]] to sing "the entire score of ''H.M.S. Pinafore''" as a last request, which is fulfilled.  At an earlier point in the same episode, the Simpson family sings along to a cassette recording of "Three Little Maids from School" while driving to their new home.  In the episode "[[Deep Space Homer]]", a briefly sober [[Barney Gumble]] does several backflips while singing a line of "[[Major-General's Song|I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General]]" from ''The Pirates of Penzance''. In yet another episode, entitled "[[Bart's Inner Child]]", Bart identifies himself as "Ruddigore" in a clever homage to the Gilbert & Sullivan operetta by that name. (The [[libretto]] of ''Ruddigore'' makes several references to being "a bad Bart".)

*An [[Animaniacs]] short entitled "HMS Yakko" parodies ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' and ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', culminating in a parody of [[Major-General's Song]], "I Am the Very Model of A Cartoon Individual".

*Many references to G&S works are made in the television comedy series "Frasier", with both Niles and Frasier Crane singing "Three little maids from school are we" in one episode.

*In ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'', in the fifth season Charles Gunn has the ability to be a good lawyer input into his head, along with a lot of Gilbert and Sullivan, because it's "great for elocution".  He then mentions that he could sing all of ''The Pirates of Penzance'', and later in the series breaks into "Three Little Maids" from ''The Mikado.''

*The episode "[[And It's Surely To Their Credit]]" (2x05) of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' has several references to Gilbert and Sullivan, ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' in particular.

*The episode ''The Cold Open'' (1x02) of ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'' has several references to "Major-General's Song" from ''The Pirates of Penzance'', including a parody of the song opening the show-within-a-show. Incidentally, both the ''West Wing'' and ''Studio 60'' episodes were written by [[Aaron Sorkin]].

*In the popular sci-fi series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' one of Marcus' many comic interludes involves his singing the 'Modern Major General' song from ''The Pirates of Penzance'' over the closing credits of one episode, much to Doctor Franklin's distress.

*In the [[Australian]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]'', [[Harold Bishop]] is a fan of Gilbert & Sullivan and often makes references to them.

*The ''[[VeggieTales]]'' series refers to Gilbert and Sullivan many times:
**In the episode "Lyle the Kindly Viking", Archibald Asparagus claims to have found a long lost Gilbert and Sullivan piece (it turns out to have been written by Gilbert Jones and Sullivan 'O Kelly).
**In the episode "The Wonderful World of Auto-Tainment", Archibald performs "Modern Major General."
**In the episode "The Star of Christmas", the two main characters (Cavis and Millward) are based on Gilbert and Sullivan. Also in this episode, Cavis's office wall displays posters for two Gilbert and Sullivan operas (''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''The Mikado'').
**''The Mikado'' was also used as the inspiration for the ''[[VeggieTales]]'' episode, "Sumo of the Opera."
**Finally, the ''[[VeggieTales]]'' song ''The Pirates Who Won't Do Anything'' is loosely inspired by ''The Pirates of Penzance''.

*The TV series ''[[Family Guy]]'' drew from Gilbert and Sullivan with a number of references and parodies, especially in season four.
