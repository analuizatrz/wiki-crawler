'''Dr. James Joseph Truchard''' (born [[June 25]], [[1943]] in [[Austin County, Texas]]) is the co-founder and current [[president]] and [[CEO]] of [[National Instruments]], a company producing automated test equipment and virtual instrumentation software.  Truchard is a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences]].

==Biography==
James Joseph Truchard was born June 25, [[1943]] in [[Austin County, Texas]], the fourth of seven children born to Joe Truchard and Lillie Schneider.  Truchard earned a [[B.S.]] and an [[M.S.]] in [[physics]], and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]].  Following his graduation, Truchard worked as managing director of the acoustical measurements division at the U.T. Applied Research Laboratories.<ref name="bio"/>

==Founding a Company==
After two years of working for U.T., Truchard realized that there was little room for promotion unless one of his coworkers retired.  As he often remarks, he "didn't see a job I wanted [in Austin] - so I created one!"<ref name="utalum" >{{cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =  | coauthors =   | title = Dr. James Truchard  | page  =  | work =   | publisher = University of Texas at Austin  | date =   | url =http://www.utexas.edu/ogs/alumni/laurels/truchard.html  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-03-02 }}</ref>  Working with colleagues Jeff Kodosky and Bill Nowlin, Truchard was part of a project conducting research for the [[U.S. Navy]] that allowed them to use early computer technology to collect and analyze data.  Frustrated with the inefficient data collection methods they were using, the three decided to create a product that would enable their task to be done more easily.  In [[1976]], working in the garage at Truchard's home, the three founded [[National Instruments]] and began designing an interface board.<ref name="seegmiller" >{{cite web  | last = Seegmiller  | first = Neal  | authorlink =  | coauthors =   | title = James Truchard and National Instruments: Engineering a Successful Company  | page  =  | work =   | publisher =University of Texas at Austin  | date = 2006  | url =http://www.engr.utexas.edu/roden/archive/essay/2006/1st2006.pdf  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-03-02 }}</ref>

The group hired their first employee, Kim Harrison-Hoson in [[1977]] to process orders and deal with customers.<ref name="seegmiller"/>  Truchard's job at UT had provided him with some experience in developing products but not with managing employees or a business, so he read many books on the business and management principles in order to learn how to run a company.<ref name="epn"/> In 1980, as they reached $300,000 in sales, Truchard was able to leave his job at UT to concentrate on his new company full-time.<ref name="seegmiller"/>

In [[1986]], in conjunction with Kodosky, Truchard played a pivotal role in the development of the [[LabVIEW]] graphical development software, which allows scientists to quickly build solutions for  their measurement and automation needs. The graphical programming interface that LabVIEW provided revolutionized the way engineers and scientists worked.<ref name="bio"/>

==National Instruments==
After the release of LabVIEW, the company's future seemed secured.  Under Truchard's leadership, NI has seen growth in 29 of its 30 years (as of [[2006]]).  With the goal of balancing the success of customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers, Truchard has led with a conservative, deliberate approach.  The company focuses on innovation, growth, and expansion and prizes innovation and entrepreneurship, and has been named as one of the ''[[Fortune Magazine|Fortune]]'' "100 Best Companies to Work For" for eight consecutive years ([[2000]]-[[2007]]).<ref name="bio"/>

Affectionately known to his employees as "Dr. T," Truchard insists that he and others in the management structure at NI remain accessible to their employees.<ref name="seegmiller"/>  Despite his stature as the sole CEO in the company's history, Truchard is still an approachable and down-to-earth individual.  He still drives an old pick up truck to work, where he does not have an assigned parking space.  Unless he is scheduled to attend an external business meeting, Truchard wears denim jeans to work every day, and sits in a cubicle in the middle of the 8th floor, where employees are free to walk up and discuss any issues they might have.<ref name="epn" >{{cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =  | coauthors =   | title = Dialog: with James Truchard, CEO of National Instruments  | page  =  | work =   | publisher =EPN  | date = [[2005]]  | url =http://www.epn-online.com/page/18046/dialog-with-james-truchard-ceo-of-national-instruments-james-truchard-this-rarely-.html  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-03-02 }}</ref>

==Professional Activities and Recognition==
Shortly after the development of LabVIEW, in [[1987]] Truchard received one of the first Texas High Technology Entrepreneur awards.  Twelve years later he was awarded a Texas High Technology Master Entrepreneur of the Year honor.   He was named one of the nation's 50 Best CEOs in three consecutive years by ''Worth'' Magazine.  In [[2002]], Truchard was inducted into the Electronic Design Engineering Hall of Fame, and the following year he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. He has also been named a University of Texas Distinguished Engineering Graduate,<ref name="bio" >{{cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =  | coauthors =   | title = Dr. James Truchard  | page  =  | work =   | publisher = National Instruments  | date = 2007  | url =http://www.ni.com/company/truchard.htm  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-03-02 }}</ref> and in [[2007]] Truchard was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]].<ref name="nae" >{{cite web  | last =   | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =   | title = Dr. James J.

Truchard is a member and former chairman of the Engineering Foundation Advisory Council, and is a member of the University of Texas Chancellor's Council.  He previously served on the UT Electrical and Computer Engineering Visiting Committee, and was a founding member of the Austin Software Council.  [[Texas]] [[governor]] [[Rick Perry]] appointed Truchard to the state's Advisory Council on the Digital Economy and invited Truchard to chair the Texas Science, Technology, and Math Industry Advisory Council, which seeks to reverse the declining interest of young people in technical careers.<ref name="bio"/>

==Personal life==
Truchard and his wife, Wanda, live in [[Austin, Texas]] in a house overlooking [[Lake Travis]].  They have four grown children, including Michael, who works in the IT department at National Instruments.
