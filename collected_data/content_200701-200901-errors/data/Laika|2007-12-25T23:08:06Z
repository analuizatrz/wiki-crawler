[[Image:Laika.jpg|framed|Laika, in 1957, became the first animal to be launched into orbit, paving the way for [[human spaceflight]].  She is shown here in her flight harness.]]
'''Laika''' (from [[Russian language|Russian]]: '''Лайка''', a [[Laika (dog breed)|breed of dog]], literally: "Barker") was a [[Russian space dogs|Russian space dog]] which became the first recorded living creature from Earth to enter [[orbit]]. At one time a stray wandering the streets of [[Moscow]], she was selected from an animal shelter. Originally named '''Kudryavka''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: '''кудрявка'''), she was renamed Laika after her breed type. After undergoing training with two other dogs, she was selected to be the occupant of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft [[Sputnik 2]] and was launched into [[outer space|space]] on [[3 November]] [[1957]]. 

Laika died a few hours after launch from [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[overheating]], probably due to a malfunction in the thermal control system. The true cause of her death was not made public until decades after the flight. <ref name="45YRSLATER">{{cite web|url=http://dogsinthenews.com/issues/0211/articles/021103a.htm|title=Message from the First Dog in Space Received 45 Years Too Late|publisher=Dogs in the News|date=[[2002-11-03]]|accessdate=4 October|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Although Laika could not survive the trip, the experiment proved that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure [[weightlessness]]. It paved the way for human [[spaceflight]] and provided scientists with some of the first data on how living [[organism]]s react to spaceflight environments.

==Sputnik 2==
{{main|Sputnik 2}}
After the success of [[Sputnik 1]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the [[Soviet leader]], wanted a second spacecraft launched on [[November 7]], the 40th anniversary of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. A more sophisticated satellite was already under construction, but it would not be ready until December;  this satellite would later become [[Sputnik 3]].<ref name="NASA3">{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/harford.html|title=Korolev's Triple Play: Sputniks 1, 2, and 3|publisher=NASA|author=James J. Harford|date=1997|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

To meet the November deadline, a new, less sophisticated design had to be built. According to Russian sources, the official decision to launch Sputnik 2 was made on October 10 or 12, leaving the team only four weeks to design and build the space craft.<ref name="AZ">{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/laika_anniversary_991103.html|title=The True Story of Laika the Dog|author=Anatoly Zak|date=[[1999-11-03]]|accessdate=28 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Sputnik 2, therefore, was something of a rush job, with most elements of the space craft being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring [[solar radiation]] and [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref name="NASA3" /><!--http://dogsinthenews.com/issues/0211/articles/021103a.htm-->

The craft was equipped with a life-support system consisting of an O<sub>2</sub> generator and devices to avoid [[Oxygen toxicity|oxygen poisoning]] and to absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded 15&nbsp;°C (59&nbsp;°F), was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A [[harness]] was designed to be fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict its movements to standing, sitting or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure and the dog's movements.<ref name="DM">{{cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002iaf..confE.288M|title=Abstract:Some Unknown Pages of the Living Organisms' First Orbital Flight|author=Malashenkov, D.

==Training and voyage==
The dog that would later be named Laika was found as a stray wandering the streets of [[Moscow]]. She was a [[mongrel]] female, approximately three years old, and weighed about 6&nbsp;kg (13&nbsp;lb). Soviet personnel gave her several names and nicknames, among them Kudryavka ([[Russian language|Russian]] for ''Little Curly''), Zhuchka (''Little Bug'') and Limonchik (''Little Lemon''). Laika, the Russian name for several [[List of dog breeds|breeds of dogs]] similar to the [[husky]], was the name popularized around the world. The American press dubbed her Muttnik (''[[Mixed-breed dog|mutt]]'' + suffix ''[[-nik]]'') as a [[pun]] on [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]],<ref name="NASA">{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/animals.html|title=A Brief History of Animals in Space|publisher=NASA|author= Tara Gray|date=1998|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> or referred to her as ''Curly''.<ref name="BL">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/frontpage/spacedog.html|title=Space Dog Lives|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Her true pedigree is unknown, although it is generally accepted that she was part husky or other Nordic breed, and possibly part [[terrier]].<ref name="AJL">{{cite web|url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Sputnik2/SpaceViews%20November%201997%20Articles.htm|title=Sputnik 2: The First Animal in Orbit|author= Andrew J.

The [[Soviet Union]] and the United States had previously sent animals only on [[sub-orbital]] flights.<ref name="STO">{{cite web|url=http://www.spacetoday.org/Astronauts/Animals/Dogs.html|title=Dogs in space|publisher=Space Today Online|date=2004|accessdate=28 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Three dogs were trained for the Sputnik 2 flight: Albina, Mushka, and Laika.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2367681.stm|title=First dog in space died within hours|publisher=BBC|author= Dr David Whitehouse|date=[[2002-10-28]]|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Russian space-life scientist [[Oleg Gazenko]] selected and trained Laika.<ref name="NLM">{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/animals/laika.html|title=Animals as Cold Warriors:Missiles, Medicine and Man's Best Friend|publisher=National Library of Medicine|date=[[2006-06-19]]|accessdate=28 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Albina flew twice on a high-altitude test [[rocket]], and Mushka was used to test instrumentation and [[life support]].<ref name="SPUT1" /><ref name="STO" /> To adapt the dogs to the confines of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. [[Laxatives]] did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in [[centrifuge]]s that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their [[blood pressure]] to increase by 30&ndash;65 [[torr]]. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.<ref name="SPUT1" />

According to a [[NASA]] document, Laika was placed in the satellite on [[October 31]] [[1957]]&mdash;three days before the start of the mission.<ref name="SPUT1" /> The temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold at that time of year, so a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on [[November 3]] [[1957]] from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], Laika's [[fur]] was sponged in a weak [[ethanol|alcohol]] solution and carefully groomed. [[Iodine]] was painted onto areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.<ref name="LM">{{cite web|url=http://www.novareinna.com/bridge/laika.html|title=Memorial to Laika|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

At peak acceleration Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate.<ref name="SPUT1" /> The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik 2's [[nose cone]] was jettisoned successfully. However, the "Block A" core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the [[thermal insulation]] tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F).<ref name="NASA2">{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1957-002A|title=Sputnik 2|publisher=NASA|date=[[2005-10-20]]|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> After three hours of [[weightlessness]], Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min,<ref name="JAP">{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/91/4/1501|title=Historical aspects of the early Soviet/Russian manned space program|volume=91|issue=4| pages=1501–1511|author=John B.

The early [[telemetry]] indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food.<ref name="NASA2" /> Approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further life signs were received from the spacecraft.<ref name="SPUT1" />

The Russian scientists had planned to euthanize Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from [[asphyxia|oxygen starvation]] when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanized. There were many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her passing. In 1999, several [[Russia]]n sources said that she died after four days when the cabin overheated.<ref name="AZ" /> In October 2002, Dr. [[Dimitri Malashenkov]], one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died five to seven hours after launch from overheating and stress. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in [[Houston, Texas]], "It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints."<ref name="DM">{{cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002iaf..confE.288M|title=Abstract:Some Unknown Pages of the Living Organisms' First Orbital Flight|author=Malashenkov, D.

==Controversy==
Due to the overshadowing issue of the Soviet vs. American [[Space Race]], the ethical problems of this experiment went largely unaddressed for some time. As newspaper clippings from 1957 show,<ref name="45YRSLATER" /> the press was more preoccupied with reporting the political perspective, while the health and retrieval (or lack thereof) of Laika was hardly mentioned. Only later were there discussions regarding the fate of the dog.

Sputnik 2 was not designed to be retrievable, so Laika had always been intended to die.<ref name="AZ" /> The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the [[Cruelty to animals|mistreatment of animals]] and [[animal testing]] in general to advance science.<ref name="NLM" />

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Dogs Trust|National Canine Defence League]] called on all dog owners to observe a minute's silence, while the [[RSPCA|Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (RSPCA) received protests even before the Soviet Union had finished announcing the mission's success. [[Animal rights|Animal rights groups]] at the time called on members of the public to protest at Soviet embassies.<ref name="BBCold">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/3/newsid_3191000/3191083.stm|title=On this day|publisher=BBC|date=[[1957-11-03]]|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Others demonstrated outside the [[United Nations]] in [[New York]];<ref name="NLM" /> nevertheless, laboratory researchers in the U.S. offered some support for the Russians, at least before the news of Laika's death.<ref name="NLM" /><ref name="NSMR">{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/animals/images/laika7Big.jpg|title=Human Guinea Pigs and Sputnik 2|publisher=National Society for Medical Research|date=November 1957|accessdate=28 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In the Soviet Union, there was apparently less controversy. Neither the media, books in the following years, nor the public openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space to die. It was not until 1998, after the collapse of the Soviet regime, that [[Oleg Gazenko]], one of the scientists responsible for sending Laika into space, expressed regret for allowing her to die: "The more time passes, the more I'm sorry about it.  We shouldn't have done it... We did not learn enough from this mission to justify the death of the dog."<ref name="45YRSLATER" /><ref name="MA" /><!--not a reliable source:[http://www.spacedog.biz/gscfiles/gscgazscript.htm]--><!--2006-10-05 Corrected the quote and added a more reliable source: [http://dogsinthenews.com/issues/0211/articles/021103a.htm]-->

==In popular culture==

[[Image:Opportunity-Laikia-soil-target-sol-400.jpg|thumb|200px|NASA named this soil target on Mars after Laika during the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] mission]]Laika's pioneering journey made her one of the most [[List of famous dogs|famous dog]]s in the world. 
She is perhaps the only character in the [[Monument to the Conquerors of Space]] (1964), other than [[Lenin]] himself, who can be
individually identified by name. 
A plaque commemorating fallen cosmonauts was unveiled at the Institute for Aviation and Space Medicine in [[Star City, Moscow]], in November 1997; Laika appears in one corner.<ref name="MA" /> Several postage stamps from different countries have pictured her. Brands of [[chocolate]] and [[cigarette]]s were named in her honour, and a large collection of Laika [[memorabilia]] still appear in auctions today.<ref name="NLM" />

On [[March 9]], [[2005]], a patch of soil on [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] was unofficially named Laika by mission controllers. It is located near [[Vostok Crater]] in [[Meridiani Planum]]. It was examined by the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''[[Opportunity Rover|Opportunity]]'s'' microscopic imager on [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|Sol]] 400.<ref name="MR">{{cite web|url=http://www.marstoday.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=15832|title=NASA Mars Rover Status Report: 17 March 2005|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=[[2005-03-18]]|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Laika has been featured in numerous works of literature, often with a theme of her survival or rescue. The novel ''Intervention'' by [[Julian May]] mentions Laika's rescue by a sympathetic alien race. In the novel ''Weight: The Myth of Atlas and Heracles'' by [[Jeanette Winterson]], the ancient Greek titan Atlas finds Laika's capsule in orbit and adopts the dog. In ''Habitus'', by [[James Flint (British novelist)|James Flint]], Laika survives and continues to orbit the earth, having learned to draw sustenance from the world's radio transmissions. There are also stories of her funeral (in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' novel ''[[Alien Bodies]]'') and travel to other planets (in the comic anthology ''[[Flight (comic)|Flight]]''). Contemporary Japanese author [[Haruki Murakami]]'s book, ''[[Sputnik Sweetheart]]'', refers to Laika's death on its title page with a quotation from The Complete Chronicle of World History. [[Nick Abadzis]]' [[graphic novel]] ''[[Laika (comics)|Laika]]'' is a fictionalized version of the dog's life.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=129972 Talking with Nick Abadzis about ''Laika''], [[Newsarama]], [[September 19]], [[2007]].

Retrieved on [[2007-11-07]].</ref>

A number of bands have taken inspiration from Laika for their names, including [[Laika Dog]], [[Laika & The Cosmonauts]] and the eponymous [[Laika (band)|Laika]], whose first three albums feature the canine [[cosmonaut]] in their cover art. The [[Spain|Spanish]] [[pop music|pop]] [[band (music)|group]] [[Mecano]], the Canadian band [[Arcade Fire]], the band [[Moxy Früvous]] and the Swedish band [[The Cardigans]] have all written songs called "Laika". In 1986, [[C.C.C.P. (band)|CCCP]] released ''Cosmos'' featuring the song "Laika Laika", complete with Russian military men's chorus. Laika has been featured in songs by (among others) [[Akino Arai]] ("Sputnik"); [[Åge Aleksandersen]] ("Laika"); [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]] ("Absent Friends" and "Laika's Theme"); [[Havalina]] ("Leica"); [[The Motorhomes]] ("Into the Night"); [[Neighborhood 2 (Laïka)| Neighborhood #2 (Laïka)]], by the [[Arcade Fire]]; [[Mighty Sparrow]] ("Russian Satellite"); [[Pond (band)|Pond]] ("My Dog is an Astronaut, Though"); Kyler England ("Laika") and [[The Circle Jerks]] ("Dog"). In 2002, the group [[Spacemonkeyz]] released a remixed version of the ''[[Gorillaz (album)|Gorillaz]]'' album called ''[[Laika Come Home]]''. [[György Kurtág]]'s tape composition, ''Memoire de Laika'' (1990) incorporates spoken text about the dog. 

The 2007 video for the [[Trentemøller]] song, ''Moan'', was about Laika.  In the 1985 [[Sweden|Swedish]] film ''[[My Life as a Dog]]'' (''Mitt liv som hund''), the protagonist—a boy who feels powerless over his own fate—compares himself to Laika.
