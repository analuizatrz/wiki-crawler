'''''Coronation Street''''' is [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s longest-running television [[soap opera]], which was first broadcast on Friday [[December 9]], [[1960]], in the [[Granada Television|Granada]] region of [[ITV]] and is consistently the highest-rated programme on British television.

The show was created by [[Tony Warren]] and is produced by [[Granada Television]] (now branded [[Granada Productions|ITV Productions]]), holder of the [[ITV|ITV franchise]] for the north-west of England, and was initially shown only in that area.  Between December 1960, and March 1961, other ITV franchises began to broadcast the programme, becoming fully networked on [[March 3]], 1961, when it started to be aired by [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]], the only remaining franchise.<ref>Kershaw. p.30.</ref><ref name="littlepg10">Little. (2000) p.10.</ref>

''Coronation Street'' (commonly nicknamed and written as 'Corrie' or 'the Street') is set in a fictional street in '[[Weatherfield]]', a fictional suburb of [[Manchester]], [[England]], based loosely on [[Salford]].  The programme examines the lives of the residents of the fictional street, who are predominantly working-class.  Coronation Street itself consists of a row of seven early 20th century [[terraced house]]s on its northern side with a [[public house]], [[Rovers Return Inn|'The Rovers Return Inn']], at one end, and a [[General store|corner shop]] at the other.  The southern side of the street consists of a factory, two shop units, a garage and three houses, all constructed in the late 1980s. The programme now also incorporates the residents of neighbouring streets, including Rosamund Street, Victoria Street and Viaduct Street.

As of 2007, ''Coronation Street'' is broadcast in Britain at 19.30 and 20.30 each Monday, and 19.30 Wednesday, Friday and Sunday on terrestrial network [[ITV1]], and in the Republic of Ireland on [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]] at the same time schedule. Repeat episodes and specials can be seen on ITV1's sister channel, [[ITV2]], with an [[Omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] edition shown on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.  Since its launch the programme has aired in many countries worldwide including Canada, Australia, Belgium and Holland<ref>{{cite news  |first = Glenda |last = Young |title = Coronation Street overseas |url = http://www.corrie.net/start/faq.html#watch |format = Website |work = Corrie.net |accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref>.

The working title of the show was 'Florizel Street', but a tea lady named Agnes remarked that 'Florizel' sounded like a disinfectant so the name was changed.<ref>Warren, Tony ''40 Years On Coronation Street: Celebration Special''. [[London Weekend Television]], 2000.</ref>  The choice of new name was between ''Jubilee Street'' and ''Coronation Street'', with Granada executives Harry Latham, Harry Elton and [[H V Kershaw|H.V. Kershaw]] deciding on the latter.<ref>Kershaw. p.22-24.</ref>

==Background to Coronation Street==
''Coronation Street'' is known on occasions for its light humour and comic characters, which carry on traditions of northern variety, with many of the show's actors having working extensively in [[repertory theatre]], notably [[Oldham Coliseum Theatre|the Oldham Rep]].<ref>Little. (2000) p.176.</ref>  The programme is also recognised as a drama serial, and its storylines have covered diverse topics and themes, gaining popularity, and sometimes controversy, with viewers. ''(see [[Storylines of Coronation Street]] for details)''.

For a number of years, ''Coronation Street'' became known for the portrayal of strong-female characters,<ref>Geraghty, Christine. ''Women and Soap Opera'', Polity Press, London, 1991. (ISBN 0-7456-0568-0)</ref> with names like [[Ena Sharples]], [[Annie Walker]], [[Elsie Tanner]] and [[Hilda Ogden]] becoming [[household name]]s during the 1960s.<ref>Little. (2000) p.5.</ref>  Tony Warren created a programme that was largely matrifocal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up<ref>{{cite news |first = Will |last = Hadcroft |title = Daran Little interview |url = http://www.corrie.net/profiles/interviews/little.html |format = Website |work = Corrie.net |accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref>.  The 1970s and 1980s saw the rise and development of characters such as [[Bet Lynch]], [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]], [[Vera Duckworth]] and [[Ivy Brennan|Ivy Tilsley]] who also fitted the 'strong woman' mould.  While a wider view of the community is now presented within the programme, its matrifocal nature is still in evidence with contemporary characters like [[Eileen Grimshaw]], [[Karen McDonald]] and newcomer, [[Carla Connor]].

==Characters and characterisations==
{{further|[[List of characters from Coronation Street]]}}
Since 1960, ''Coronation Street'' has featured hundreds of characters, whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed.  The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the figures of Ena Sharples ([[Violet Carson]]), Elsie Tanner ([[Patricia Phoenix]]) and Annie Walker ([[Doris Speed]]) as central characters.<ref>Little. (1995) p.7.</ref>   These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became [[archetype]]s of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials.  Ena Sharples, caretaker of the [[Mission (station)|Glad Tidings Mission Hall]], was the street's [[busybody]], battleaxe and self-proclaimed moral voice.<ref>Tinker. p.38.</ref>  Elsie Tanner was the [[Hooker with a heart of gold|tart with a heart]], who was constantly hurt by men in the search of true love.<ref>Tinker. p.57.</ref>  Annie Walker, landlady of [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]], had delusions of grandeur and saw herself to be better than other residents of ''Coronation Street''.<ref>Tinker. p.40.</ref>

Of the original cast, only one character remains today: [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]).  Barlow entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and the model [[Twiggy]] were to re-shape the concept of youthful rebellion.  Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off, Ken has remained the constant link throughout 46 years of ''Coronation Street''.
[[Image:Bet lynch.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bet Gilroy (n√©e Lynch) from a 1994 episode of Coronation Street.]]
1964 saw the introduction of [[Stan Ogden|Stan]] & [[Hilda Ogden]], with Hilda ([[Jean Alexander]]) becoming one of the most famous British soap characters of all time.  In a 1982 poll, Hilda was voted the fourth most recognizable woman in Britain after the [[Queen Mother]], [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].<ref>Little. (1995) p.188.</ref>   The Ogdens were portrayed as the commonest family on the street.  Hilda's most famous attributes were her pinny, hair curlers and the [[mural|"muriel"]] in her living room with three 'flying' duck ornaments.  Hilda Ogden's final episode on [[December 25]], [[1987]], remains the highest rated episode of ''Coronation Street'' ever, with nearly 27 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news  |first = Dennis |last = Barker |title = Obituary: Leslie Duxbury |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1635800,00.html |format = Website edition |work = The Guardian |date = [[November 07]], [[2005]] |accessdate = 2006-09-02}}</ref>

Bet Lynch ([[Julie Goodyear]]) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970.<ref>Little. (2000) p.66.</ref>  She would go on to become one of the most famous ''Corrie'' characters ever, standing as the central character of the show from 1987 until departing in 1995.

''Coronation Street'' and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some its current cast being based loosely on past characters.  [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) embodies the role of the acid-tongued busybody, once held by Ena Sharples.  [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Whittaker]]) has grown snobbish, much like Annie Walker, while a number of the programme's female characters mirror the vulnerability of Elsie Tanner and Bet Lynch.  Other recurring archetypes have included the war veteran ([[Albert Tatlock]], [[Percy Sugden]]), the bumbling retail manager ([[Leonard Swindley]], Reg Holdsworth, [[Norris Cole]]), and the perennial losers (Stan & Hilda Ogden, [[Jack Duckworth|Jack]] & [[Vera Duckworth]]).

==History==
===The 1960s: Kitchen-sink drama===
[[Image:Ken barlow.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Ken Barlow in the first episode of ''Coronation Street''.]]

The serial began on [[December 9]], [[1960]], and was not initially a critical success. Granada commissioned only 13 episodes and some inside the company doubted the show would last its planned production run. Despite the negativity, viewers were immediately drawn to the serial, won over by ''Coronation Street'''s focus on the plight of "ordinary folk". The programme also made use of Northern English language and [[dialect]]; affectionate local terms like "eh, chuck?", "nowt" and "by heck!" became widely heard on British television for the first time.

Storylines were based on the experiences of families and their interaction, and on relationships between individuals of different ages, classes and social structures. Stories also addressed how working-class people made a caste system in their own mini-society and excommunicated others they did not wish to associate with. In reality, many of the people deemed too common (like Elsie Tanner or Stan and Hilda Ogden) were of the exact same stock as those who were judging them.

Early episodes told the story of student Kenneth Barlow, who had won a place at university and thus found his background something of an embarrassment.<ref>TV Times. (1960) p.8.</ref> The character is one of the few to have experienced life 'outside' of ''Coronation Street'', and in some ways predicts the decline of similar communities. In a 1961 episode, Barlow declares: "You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than Elsie Tanner and her boyfriends."
 
[[Image:enaelsiefight.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Ena and Elsie were adversaries from the day they met each other, and their mutual antagonism rarely subsided.]]

Also at the centre of many early stories was Ena Sharples, and her friends: timid [[Minnie Caldwell]] ([[Margot Bryant]]) and bespectacled [[Martha Longhurst]] (Lynne Carol). The trio were likened to the [[Greek chorus]], and the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', as they would sit in the snug bar of the Rovers Return, passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.<ref>Tinker. p.31.</ref>  Headstrong Ena often clashed with Elsie Tanner, whom she believed espoused a rather disgusting set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which, most of the time, had little basis in reality.

In September 1961, ''Coronation Street'' reached No.1 in the television ratings and remained there for the rest of the year.<ref name="littlepg10"/> Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15 million) tuned into ''Corrie''.<ref>Little. (1995) p.35.</ref> By 1964 the programme had over 20 million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on [[December 2]], [[1964]], with 21.36 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=BFI Most Watched 1960s|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html|accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref>

Storylines which proved popular with viewers included the following: a mystery poison-pen letter received by Elsie Tanner, the 1962 marriage of Ken Barlow and [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie Tatlock]], [[Most controversial storylines of Coronation Street#Killing of Martha Longhurst|the death of Martha Longhurst]] in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner's wedding to Steve Tanner as well as a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), the murder of Steve Tanner in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.
 
In spite of rising popularity with viewers, ''Coronation Street'' was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban [[working-class]], and its representation of a community that was a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert C| last=Allen|title=Soap Opera|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref>  After the first episode in 1960, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' printed: "The programme is doomed from the outset... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week."<ref>Tinker. p.12-3</ref>  By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the ''1950s''.  Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including drugs, sex, homosexuality and pregnancy, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.<ref name="littlepg45"/> ''Coronation Street'' would continue to receive criticism of being out of touch, and out of date for the rest of its existence.

===The 1970s===
[[Image:Valerieelectrocuted.jpg|rightt|thumb|250px|Val Barlow in her final scene, mending the plug of a hairdryer before she was electrocuted.]]
The show‚Äôs production team was tested when many core cast members left the programme in the early 1970s.  When Arthur Leslie died suddenly in 1970, his character, Rovers landlord Jack Walker, died with him.<ref>Little. (2000) p.67.</ref>  [[Anne Reid]] quit as Valerie Barlow, and was killed off in 1971, electrocuting herself with a faulty hairdryer.<ref>Little. (2000) p.73.</ref>  Ratings reached a low of 8 million in February 1973, and Pat Phoenix quit as Elsie Tanner, Violet Carson (Ena Sharples) was written out for most of the year through illness, and Doris Speed (Annie Walker) took two months‚Äô leave.<ref>Little. (2000) p.86.</ref>  ITV daytime soap ''[[Crossroads (TV series)|Crossroads]]'' saw a marked increase in viewers at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson ([[Noele Gordon]]), grew in popularity.<ref>Little. (2000) p.86.</ref> These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of Bet Lynch, [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) and [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973, with characters such as [[Gail Platt|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]] and [[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974.  These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years.<ref>Little. (2000) p.79.</ref><ref>Little. (2000) p.93.</ref>

The 1970s was also the decade when ''Coronation Street'' began to include more comedy in its storylines, at the insistance of new producer [[Bill Podmore]] who joined in 1976, having worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.<ref>Little. (2000) p.107.</ref>  Stan and Hilda Ogden were often at the centre of overtly funny storylines, with other comic characters including [[Eddie Yeats]] ([[Geoffrey Hughes]]), [[Fred Gee]] ([[Fred Feast]]) and [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[William Tarmey]]) all making their first appearances.
[[Image:Gail potter.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Gail Potter and Ray Langton in an episode from 1975.]]
In 1976, Pat Phoenix returned to her role as Elsie Tanner and, after a spate of ill health, Violet Carson returned as Ena. ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter & [[Suzie Birchall]] moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff Bet Lynch, [[Betty Driver|Betty Turpin]] and Fred Gee.

Storylines which proved popular with viewers included: the death of Val Barlow, a warehouse fire in 1975, the 1977 birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]], the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of [[Brian Tilsley]] and Gail Potter, also in 1979.

''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its primetime slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially-viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working-class life.<ref>Liddement. (2004)</ref>

===The 1980s===
Between 1980 and 1989, ''Coronation Street'' underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch.  By May 1984, Ken Barlow stood as the only original cast member, after the departures of Ena Sharples, Annie Walker, Elsie Tanner and [[Albert Tatlock]].<ref>Little. (2000) p.134. and p.153-159.</ref>  In 1983, [[antihero]] [[Len Fairclough]], one of the show's central male characters since 1961, was killed off, and in 1984, [[Bernard Youens]] (Stan Ogden) died.<ref>Little. (2000) p.153-159.</ref>  While the press predicted the end of ''Corrie'', H.V. Kershaw reminded viewers that "There are no stars in ''Coronation Street''."<ref>Tinker. p.62.</ref>  Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with previously established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast. The Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983, and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens. Percy Sugden appeared in 1983, and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock. The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985, when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie) was installed as landlady.

The decade saw many weddings: Ken Barlow married Deirdre Langton on [[27 July]], [[1981]]. The episode was watched by over 24 million viewers - more ITV viewers than the wedding of [[Prince Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] two days later.<ref>{{cite web | work=corrie.net | title= Weddings |url= http://www.corrie.net/profiles/lists/weddings.html| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> [[Alf Roberts]] married [[Audrey Roberts|Audrey Potter]] in 1985, [[Kevin Webster]] married [[Sally Webster|Sally Seddon]] in 1986, and Bet Lynch married [[Alec Gilroy]] in 1987, with 1988 seeing the marriages of Ivy Tilsley and [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street character)|Don Brennan]], and [[Derek Wilton]] and Mavis Riley.

[[Image:deirdrekenfight.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Deirdre and Ken Barlow, in a cap from a 1983 episode of Coronation Street, arguing after the revelation of Deirdre's affair with Mike Baldwin.]]
The arrival of [[Channel 4]] and its edgy new serial ''[[Brookside]]'' in 1982 was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street'', as well as the [[BBC]]'s new primetime soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.<ref>Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> While ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''EastEnders'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures.<ref>Little. (2000) p.170.</ref>  With primetime competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being failure with viewers.<ref name="littlepg165">Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer, David Liddiment. A new exterior set had been built in 1982, with 1989 seeing its redevelopment to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed, with a new studio being built and the inclusion of more location filming.<ref name="littlepg188">Little. (2000) p.188.</ref>  New pressures also saw introduction of the third weekly episode on [[October 20]], [[1989]], broadcast Friday at 19:30.<ref name="littlepg188"/>

The 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as [[Deirdre Barlow]]'s affair with Mike Baldwin in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention. The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, Susan, in 1986. Other storylines included a fire in the Rovers Return in 1986, and Rita Fairclough's psychological abuse at the hands of [[Alan Bradley]], and his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]].  The show's highest rated episode (26.6 million viewers) came in 1987, when Hilda Ogden left the show. Other popular stories included: the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and Stan Ogden's funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] in 1987, and Brian Tilsley's murder in 1989.

New characters were introduced, such as Kevin and Sally Webster, [[Curly Watts]], [[Martin Platt]], Reg Holdsworth and the McDonald family.

===The 1990s===
[[Image:Sarah lancashire011.jpg|250px|thumb|left|(L-R) Curly, Raquel and Reg in a 1991 episode.]]
In spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism.  In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low-representation of [[Minority group|ethnic minorities]] and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as '''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks' (''[[The Times]]'') and 'Put colour in t'Street' (''Daily Mirror'').<ref>Little. (1995) p.217.</ref>   Patrick Stoddart of ''The Times'' wrote: "The millions who watch ''Coronation Street'' ‚Äì and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg ‚Äì know real life when they see it [‚Ä¶] in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen".<ref>Little. (2000) p.205.</ref> Black and Asian characters had appeared in minor roles over the years, but it wasn't until 1999 that show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family.

New characters [[Des Barnes|Des]] and Steph Barnes moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as '[[Yuppie]]s'.<ref>Little. (2000) p.194.</ref>  [[Raquel Watts|Raquel Wolstenhulme]] ([[Sarah Lancashire]]) first appeared in 1991, and went on to become one of the most popular characters ever.<ref>Little. (2000) p.199.</ref> The McDonald family were developed and the fiery relationships between [[Liz McDonald|Liz]], Jim, [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve]] and [[Andy McDonald (Coronation Street)|Andy]] interested viewers, after an uncertain start.<ref>Little. (2000) p.188.</ref><ref>Little. (1995) p.211.</ref> Other popular newcomers were [[Maud Grimes]], [[Roy Cropper]], Judy and Gary Mallett, [[Fred Elliott|Fred Elliot]] and [[Ashley Peacock]]. The amount of [[slapstick]] humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comic characters such as Reg Holdsworth.

Popular storylines in the early part of the decade included: the death of Katie McDonald in 1991, Mike Baldwin's wedding to Alma Sedgewick in 1992, Tommy Duckworth being sold by his father Terry in 1993, and the rise of Tanya Pooley ([[Eva Pope]]) between 1994 and 1995.
  
In 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day he axed the characters of [[Derek Wilton]], [[Don Brennan]], [[Percy Sugden]], [[Bill Webster]], Billy Williams and [[Maureen Holdsworth]].<ref>Little. (2000) p.235.</ref> [[Thelma Barlow]], who played Derek's wife Mavis, was angered by the sacking of her co-star and resigned. The production team also lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned.<ref>Little. (2000) p.235.</ref>

In line with Park's suggestion, younger characters were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by [[Adam Rickitt]], single mother Zoe Tattersall first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5.  Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults and a transsexual.<ref name="little241">Little. (2000) p.241.</ref> Park quit in 1998, after deciding that he had done what he intended to do; he maintained that his biggest achievement was the introduction of [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley Patterson]], the first [[transsexual]] character on British soap.<ref name="little241"/>
[[Image:deirdresentdown.jpg|250px|thumb|rightt|Deirdre being sent down in 1998.]]
Viewers were somewhat alienated by the new-look ''Coronation Street'', and the media voiced disapproval. Having received criticism of being too out of touch, ''Corrie'' now struggled to emulate the more modern ''Brookside'' and ''EastEnders''. In the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] wrote: "Apparently it doesn't matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company."<ref>Little. (2000) p.235.</ref>

One of ''Coronation Street'''s biggest storylines occurred in 1998, with [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Rachid]] being wrongfully imprisoned after a relationship with con-man Jon Lindsay. 19 million viewers watched Deirdre being sent to prison, and 'Free the Weatherfield One' campaigns sprung up in a media frenzy.<ref name="little241"/>  [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] even passed comment on Deirdre‚Äôs sentencing in Parliament.<ref>{{cite news|title=PM supports Weatherfield One|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/71934.stm|date=March 31, 1998|accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref> Deirdre was freed after three weeks, with Granada stating that they had always intended for her to be released, in spite of the media interest.<ref name="little241"/>

===The 2000s===
On [[8 December]] [[2000]], the show celebrated its fortieth year by broadcasting a live, hour-long, episode. The [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] made a cameo in the episode, appearing in a pre-recorded segment as himself in an ITV News bulletin report, presented by [[Sir Trevor McDonald|Trevor McDonald]].<ref name="prince">{{cite web | work=bbc.co.uk | title= Prince stars in live soap |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1061585.stm| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>  Earlier in the year, 13-year old [[Sarah Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]) had fallen pregnant and gave birth to a baby girl, [[Bethany Platt|Bethany]], on [[June 4]], with the episode where [[Gail Platt|Gail]] was told of her daughter's pregnancy being watched by 15 million viewers. The year also saw the programme's first two-hander, between Curly and Raquel Watts.

From 1999-2001, Jane Macnaught was ''Coronation Street's'' producer, and received harsh criticism from both viewers and critics. In an attempt to compete with ''EastEnders'', issue-led storylines were introduced such as [[Toyah Battersby]]'s rape, Roy & Hayley Cropper abducting their foster child, Sarah Platt's Internet chatroom abduction and [[Alma Baldwin|Alma Halliwell]]'s death of cervical cancer.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jane|last=Mcnaught|title=Coronation Street Producer|url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/producers.html}}</ref>  Such storylines were unpopular with viewers and ratings dropped and in October 2001, Macnaught was abruptly moved to another Granada department and Carolyn Reynolds took over. ''Corrie'' continued to struggle in the ratings, with ''EastEnders'' introducing some of its strongest stories. In 2002, Kieran Roberts was appointed as producer and aimed to re-introduce "gentle storylines and humour", after deciding that ''the Street'' shouldn't try and compete with other soaps.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kieran|last=Roberts|title=Coronation Street Producer|url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/producers.html}}</ref>

[[Image:Karen_Tracy.jpeg|250px|thumb|left|Karen McDonald and Tracy Barlow feuding at Karen's wedding to Steve in 2004.]]
In 2002, one of ''Coronation Street's'' best-known storylines began to unfold, which culminated in 2003. Gail Platt married [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]), a financial advisor, who would go on to leave [[Duggie Ferguson]] to die, murder his ex-wife Patricia, attempt to murder his mother-in-law, Audrey Roberts, murder [[Maxine Peacock]] and attempt to murder [[Emily Bishop]]. After confessing to the murder of Maxine and his ex-wife, Hillman attempted to kill Gail, her children Sarah and [[David Platt|David]], and her grand-daughter Bethany, by driving them into a canal. The storyline received massive press attention, and viewing figures peaked at 19.4 million, with Hillman dubbed a "serial killer" by the media. .<ref>{{cite web|first=BBC News|title=Street drama hits ratings high|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2796201.stm}}</ref>  

In 2003, [[Todd Grimshaw]] began to question his sexuality, becoming ''Corrie's'' first regular homosexual character, after years of criticism about non-representation.  The character of [[Karen McDonald]] ([[Suranne Jones]]) was developed, with her fiery marriage to Steve and warring with [[Tracy Barlow]].

In 2004, ''Coronation Street'' [[retconned]] the Baldwin family: Mike's nephew Danny Baldwin and his wife Frankie moved to the area from Essex, with their two sons Jamie and Warren.  Until this time, Mike Baldwin had been portrayed as an only child, with his father appearing in the programme between 1980 and 1982 confirming the fact.

Between 2000 and 2007, a range of storylines have been featured, such as the bigamy of [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]], [[Maya Sharma]]'s revenge on former lover [[Dev Alahan]], [[Katy Harris]] murdering her father, and subsequently committing suicide, [[Charlie Stubbs]]'s psychological abuse of [[Shelley Unwin]], the deaths of [[Mike Baldwin]] and [[Fred Elliott]], the murder of Charlie Stubbs, and the discovery of an unexploded [[World War II]] bomb in the back garden of No.4 Coronation Street.

==Production==
===Broadcast format===
Between [[December 9]], [[1960]] and [[March 3]], [[1961]], ''Coronation Street'' was broadcast twice weekly, on Monday and Friday.<ref>Little (2000) p.10.</ref>  During this period, the Friday episode was broadcast live, with the Monday episode being prerecorded 15 minutes later.<ref>Kershaw. p.30.</ref>  When the programme went fully networked on [[March 3]], [[1961]], broadcast days changed to Monday and Wednesday.<ref name="littlepg10">Little. (2000) p.10.</ref>  The last regular epiosde to be shown live aired on [[February 3]], 1961. From episode one until [[November 19]], [[1969]], the programme was broadcast in black and white.  Broadcast switched to colour from [[24 November]], 1969, but in October 1970 a technician's strike at a film developing company affected the entire ITV network and virtually all the programming on ITV had to return to using black and white, including ''Coronation Street''.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The strike was resolved in early 1971 {{Fact|date=February 2007}} and the last black and white episode aired on [[February 8]], [[1971]]. Since this date, the serial has aired in colour, except for the opening sequence of the 40th anniversary episode, which began in black and white; although this was done for effect, not as a necessity.

===Theme music===
The show's theme music, a solo [[cornet]] piece, with [[clarinet]] and [[double bass]] accompaniment, reminiscent of northern band music, was written by [[Eric Spear]] and has been only slightly modified since its debut.<ref>Kershaw. p.25.</ref>

===Sets===
{{main|Coronation Street sets}}
As befitting the soap-opera genre, ''Coronation Street'' is made up of individual housing units, plus communal areas; a newsagent's (''The Kabin''), a small cafe (''Roy's Rolls''), a general grocery shop (''D&S Alahan's''), a factory (''[[Underworld (Knickers)|Underworld]]'') and a public house, the ''Rovers Return Inn'', which is the main meeting place for characters on the programme.

From 1960-1968, all interactions on the 'outside' street were filmed on a soundstage, with the houses reduced in scale by 3/4 and constructed from wood.<ref>Tinker. p.95.</ref> In 1968, Granada built an outside set which was not all that different from the interior version previously used, with the wooden facades from the studio simply being erected on the new site.

In 1982, a full-size exterior street was built in the Granada [[backlot]], constructed from reclaimed [[Salford]] brick. The set was updated in 1989, with the construction of a new factory, two shop units and three modern semi-detached houses on the south side of ''Coronation Street''.

Between 1989 and 1999, the [[Granada Studios Tour]] allowed members of the public the opportunity to visit the set. The exterior set was extended and updated in 1999, to include a medical centre and takeaway on Rosamund Street, the newly built Victoria Street (housing three shops, two houses and a builder's yard) and (to obscure one of the Granada towerblocks) a new viaduct on Rosamund Street. The 'viaduct' is actually a fa√ßade with an optical illusion to make it look complete. Access to the outdoor set is gained from a small 'shop unit' on Viaduct Street, ''Turner's Joinery''; the unit also leads to the green room.

The majority of interior scenes are shot in the adjoining purpose-built studio.

===Production staff===
''Coronation Street's'' creator, Tony Warren wrote the first 13 episodes of the programme in 1960, and continued to write for the programme intermittently until 1976.<ref name="top10writers">{{cite web|title=Coronation Street's top ten writers|work=corrie.net|url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/writers.html|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  He still retains links with ''Coronation Street'', often advising on storylines. 

[[H V Kershaw]] (''Harry Kershaw'')<ref>{{cite web|title=H V Kershaw|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449958/|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> was the script editor for ''Coronation Street'' when the programme began in 1960, working alongside Tony Warren.  Kershaw was also a script writer for the programme and the show's producer between 1962 and 1971.  He remains the only person, along with John Finch, to have held the three posts of script editor, writer and producer.  Kershaw continued to write for the programme until his retirement in January 1988.

Adele Rose was the longest-serving ''Coronation Street'' writer, completing 455 scripts between 1961 and 1998.  She went on to create ''[[Byker Grove]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adele Rose|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741220/|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>

[[Michael Apted]], best known for the ''[[Seven Up!|Up!]]'' series of documentaries was a director on the programme in the early 1960s. This period of his career marked the first of his many collaborations with writer Jack Rosenthal.

[[Bill Podmore]] was the show's longest serving producer. By the time he stepped down in 1988 he had completed 13 years at the production helm. Nicknamed the "godfather" by the tabloid press,<ref>Podmore. p.33.</ref> he was renowned for his tough, uncompromising style and was feared by both crew and cast alike. He is probably most famous for sacking [[Peter Adamson]], the show's Len Fairclough, in 1983.

Some of the scriptwriters have transcended the show to become notable for other work. [[Jack Rosenthal]], the acclaimed television dramatist noted for such plays as ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'', began his career on the show, writing over 150 episodes between 1961 and 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack Rosenthal|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742768/#writer1960|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> [[Paul Abbott]] was a story editor on the programme in the 1980s and began writing episodes in 1989, but left in 1993 to produce ''[[Cracker (British television)|Cracker]]'', for which he later wrote, before creating his own highly-acclaimed dramas such as ''[[Touching Evil]]'' and ''[[Shameless]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Abbott|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0008036/|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> [[Russell T. Davies]][http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0203961/] was briefly a storyliner on the programme in the mid-1990s, also writing the script for the [[direct-to-video]] special "Viva Las Vegas".<ref>{{cite web|title=Russell T. Davies|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0203961/|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> He, too, has become a noted writer of his own high-profile television drama programmes, including ''[[Queer as Folk (UK)|Queer as Folk]]'' and the 2005 revival of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref>{{cite web | work=The Gallifrey Archives | title= Russell T.

==Scheduling==
===Coronation Street in the UK===
For 47 years, ''Coronation Street'' has remained at the centre of ITV1's primetime schedule.
The programme is currently shown in five episodes, on four evenings a week on ITV1.

From [[December 9]], [[1960]] - [[February 27]], [[1961]], the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Monday and Friday at 19.00.<ref name="littlepg10"/>   Schedules were changed and from [[March 3]], 1961 - [[October 18]], 1989, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Monday and Wednesday at 19.30.<ref name="littlepg10"/>  The third weekly episode was introduced on [[October 20]], 1989, broadcast Friday at 19.30.<ref>Little. (2000) p.188.</ref>  [[1996]] saw the introduction of the fourth weekly episode, broadcast Sunday at 19.30.<ref>Little. (2000) p.229.</ref>  The second Monday episode was introduced in 2002, broadcast at 20.30.  This episode was used only intermittently as an extra episode to tempt viewers during the popular Richard Hillman storyline, but since 2003, the Monday 20.30 episode has become fully-scheduled.  Additional episodes have been aired during the weekly schedule of ITV1 at certain times, notably in 2004 when, between [[November 21]], and [[November 26]], eight episodes were shown.  As the extra Monday episode used to be for special storylines, an extra Friday episode is occasionally used.

===Coronation Street overseas===
{{unreferenced|section called "Coronation Street overseas"|date=February 2007}}
''Coronation Street'' is also shown in many countries worldwide, being the centre of the TV schedule in [[Ireland]], originally being shown on [[RT√â One]] {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and is now aired on independent television station, [[TV3 Ireland]] which simulcasts with ITV.

In [[Canada]], episodes of ''Coronation Street'' air on [[CBC Television]]. As of 2007, episodes appear on CBC about eight-and-a-half months after their UK air date. It moved from a daytime slot on CBC to primetime in 2004. In 2005, CBC briefly broadcast eight episodes a week in order to reduce the gap. [[CBC Country Canada]], a digital television service operated by CBC, broadcasts older episodes as ''Corrie Classics''. The 2002 edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' recognizes the 1,144 episodes sold to CBC-owned [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]] TV station [[CBKST]] by Granada TV on [[31 May]] [[1971]] to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction.

The programme was shown in [[Australia]] during the 1960s to some success, but was off air by the 1970s. It was briefly screened by the [[Nine Network]] in 1994-1995 in a daytime slot. In the early 2000s, episodes several years old were screened on Community Broadcaster [[Channel 31 Melbourne]].  Starting in 1996, the cable and satellite station [[Arena (television network)|Arena]] began screening the series, initially in one-hour installments early on Saturday morning. The series was later moved to [[UK.TV]], where it was shown in half-hour installments.  The episodes on UK.TV are currently around 18 months behind the UK. Free-to-air Channel Nine in Perth, a city with a large number of recent U.K. ex-pats, screened the series from October 2005, until May 2006, initially shown in the 5.30pm slot, before the evening news.  Low ratings led to the series being moved to an earlier afternoon slot, until it was taken off completely on [[8 May]] [[2006]].

The series is also currently shown in [[New Zealand]], on [[Television New Zealand|Television New Zealand's]] TV One. In New Zealand, the show consistently rates in the top ten programmes nationally. Hour long episodes are shown at 7.30p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. "Corrie Street catchups" are often scheduled on Wednesdays to prevent falling further behind. Episodes are around eleven months behind those broadcast in the UK.

In the early 1970s some episodes were shown on [[WGBH]] Channel 2, the public television station in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]; while in the early-1980s, [[USA Network]] aired ''Corrie'' on weekends, but only briefly.  The [[Trio channel]] aired a few episodes of the serial as a part of special-interest programming project, but a concerted effort to air it in the American market has never materialized.  American viewers in the parts of the northern U.S. can view ''Coronation Street'' telecasts on CBC.  In particular, cable TV subscribers in places including [[Seattle]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], parts of [[Michigan]] and [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]] are able to view the programme on CBC affiliates.  Other Americans near the Canadian border can view the program via over-the-air reception from nearby CBC transmitters.

Dutch broadcaster [[VARA (radio and TV)|VARA]] showed 428 sub-titled episodes on [[Netherlands]] TV between 1967 and 1975.

According to Granada, ''Coronation Street'' had been popular in the latter part of the 1960s in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Holland]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Nigeria]], [[Singapore]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Greece]], [[Sweden]] and many other countries.<ref>TV Times special, ''Coronation Street 2000'', p.14.</ref>

In 2006, the small network Vitaya started broadcasting ''Coronation Street'' for viewers in [[Belgium]]. Currently, they are roughly two years behind ITV. In the [[U.A.E.]], episodes of ''Coronation Street'' are aired two and a half weeks after their U.K. showing.

==Spin-offs==
Granada lauched one spin-off in 1965, ''[[Pardon the Expression]]'', following the story of clothing store manager Leonard Swindley ([[Arthur Lowe]]) after he left Weatherfield.  Swindley's management experience was tested when he was appointed assistant manager at a fictional department store, Dobson and Hawks. Granada produced two series of the spin-off, which ended in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Lewisohn|title=Pardon The Expression!|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/p/pardontheexpress_7775085.shtml|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>                           

In 1968, Arthur Lowe returned as Leonard Swindley in ''Turn Out The Lights'', a sequel to ''Pardon the Expression''. It ran for just six epiosdes before it was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Lewisohn|title=Turn Out The Lights|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/turnoutthelights_7776550.shtml|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>     

In 1999, six special episodes of ''Coronation Street'' were produced, following the story of [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]], Vicky McDonald, [[Bet Gilroy]] and Reg Holdsworth in Brighton.<ref>Little. (2000) p.248.</ref>  This spin-off was subtitled ''The Rover Returns'' and released on VHS tape.
