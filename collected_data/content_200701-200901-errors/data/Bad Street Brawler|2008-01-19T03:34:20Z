'''Bad Street Brawler''' is a [[1987]] [[video game]] by [[Beam Software|Beam Software Pty., Ltd.]]. It was distributed worldwide by [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape Inc.]] and [[Mattel]]. The original ''Bad Street Brawler'' is one of the earliest [[Beat 'em up|Beat 'em up or scrolling fighting games]].

The player plays the character, Duke Davis, who goes from stage to stage beating up [[gangsters]] that get in his way, dressed in a yellow [[Tank top (shirt)|tank top]], [[sunglasses]], and yellow pants. He is described as a former [[punk rock]]er and the "world's coolest" [[martial artist]].

Before the start of the next stage, quotes are introduced to entertain the player (i.e., ''Never trouble trouble until trouble troubles you''). The player fights a variety of enemies, such as [[gorilla]]s and old ladies who throw pocketbooks at the player (resembling [[weightlifter]] dwarves who throw [[dumbbell]]s at the player).
