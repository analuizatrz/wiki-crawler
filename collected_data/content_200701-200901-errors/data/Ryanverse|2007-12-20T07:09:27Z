==In storyline==
In the order in which they occur in the storyline (and when they occur): 
* ''[[Without Remorse]]'' (1970–1971)
* ''[[Patriot Games]]'' (circa 1980. Ryan states in ''The Cardinal of the Kremlin'' these events happen "5 years ago".)
* ''[[Red Rabbit]]'' (circa fall 1982, based on Russian political references)
* ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'' (circa 1984)
* ''[[The Cardinal of the Kremlin]]'' (circa 1985)

Starting with the following novel, the ''Ryanverse'' becomes distinctly different from real history as noted below.

* ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1988) - "The President" is referred to as distinct from [[Ronald Reagan]], but events in Cardinal of the Kremlin are referred to as having concluded less than a year before the start of the novel, which takes place during an election year. Setting "Cardinal of the Kremlin" in 1991 misplaces the state of US-Soviet relations, and 1984 is before the drug war warranted the attention given in "Clear and Present Danger." The only logical date left would be 1988.
* ''[[The Sum of All Fears]]'' (1973 and 1991) – [[Israel]] partially cedes [[Jerusalem]] to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], and the city becomes a UN protectorate policed by [[Swiss Guards]]. Residents of Jerusalem can choose between either Vatican, Israeli or Islamic judicial law. [[Denver]] is devastated by a terrorist nuclear explosion.  The book occurs after the [[Persian Gulf War]] and before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, both events that occur at the same time in the Ryanverse as in actual history, hence the 1991 date.
* ''[[Debt of Honor]]'' (Takes place two years after The Sum of All Fears) — The [[U.S.]] and [[Russia]] destroy all of their [[ballistic missiles]].  After crippling the US economy and becoming a nuclear power, [[Japan]] invades and takes the [[Marianas Islands]]; the US and Japan fight a brief war, which the Japanese lose (they are subsequently denuclearized); an embittered Japanese pilot and proponent of the war crashes a 747 into the US [[Capitol Building]] during Ryan's confirmation hearing for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], killing most of the House and Senate, the [[POTUS|President]], all nine Supreme Court justices, the senior military establishment (including the JCS), and most of the Cabinet; Ryan is left in charge of a gutted government.
* ''[[Executive Orders]]'' (Starts at the same day as Debt of Honor's ending and ends weeks after) — [[Saddam Hussein]] is [[assassinated]]; [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] merge forming the [[United Islamic Republic]]; the UIR launches a biological attack on the U.S. using the [[Ebola]] [[virus]]; the US launches the Second Persian Gulf War against the UIR and defeats them; the Ayatollah is killed in a smart-bomb attack by the US.
* ''[[Rainbow Six (novel)|Rainbow Six]]'' (Takes place between Executive Orders and The Bear and the Dragon) RAINBOW - an elite counter-terrorist force - is created and engages [[terrorists]] across [[Europe]]. [[Ecoterrorist|Ecoterrorists]] plan to create a genetically-enhanced [[virus]] based off of [[Ebola]] and [[cancer]] cells, which they plan to use to wipe out much of the world's population.
* ''[[The Bear and the Dragon]]'' (Takes place one year after Executive Orders) – [[Russia]] is admitted to NATO; [[China]] and [[Russia]] fight a major war, in which the US intervenes on their [[NATO]] ally's side. It mentions the [[British Prime Minister]] and implies that it is [[Tony Blair]].
* ''[[The Teeth of the Tiger]]'' (circa 2003-2005, based on the age of Jack Ryan Jr.)  The U.S. is now engaged in a [[global war on terrorism]], in response to the [[September 11th attacks]] which occurred in the Ryanverse as they did in the real world.  It is mentioned that the wars in [[war in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]] and [[war in Iraq|Iraq]] occurred in the Ryanverse continuity, and that the Jerusalem Treaty signed in ''The Sum of All Fears'' has failed as Israelis and Palestinians went back to fighting each other.


== Presidents in the Ryanverse ==
A total of five presidents are explicitly shown in the Ryanverse; 
* the unnamed man referred to only as "the President," first introduced in ''The Hunt for Red October''; he remains in office through ''The Cardinal of the Kremlin'', and ''Clear and Present Danger''.  At the end of the last novel, he runs for reelection and is defeated.
* President J. Robert Fowler, the former governor of Ohio, who defeats the incumbent at the end of ''Clear and Present Danger'' and is in office during ''The Sum of All Fears''.  After his failure to handle the Denver crisis nearly results in nuclear war, he resigns from office at the end of the novel.
* President Roger Durling, Fowler's former vice-president, the former governor of California and a Vietnam veteran with service in the [[101st Airborne Division]].  Durling replaces Fowler when the latter resigns, and is the President in ''Debt of Honor''.  At the end of the novel, he is assassinated along with most of the government by a Japanese terrorist.
* President John Patrick Ryan; is confirmed as Durling's new vice-president at the end of ''Debt of Honor'', and becomes the President when Durling is murdered on the same day.  His claim to the presidency is contested by Durling's former VP, Edward Kealty, but the courts eventually rule in Ryan's favor.  He remains in office in ''Executive Orders'', ''Rainbow Six'' (though he never appears) and ''The Bear and the Dragon''.
* President Edward Kealty; Durling's former vice-president, replaced by Jack Ryan after a sex scandal.  During ''Executive Orders'', he tries to steal the presidency from Ryan by claiming that he never actually resigned, but those allegations are tossed out by U.S. courts.  However, after Ryan leaves office, Kealty is elected President in his own right, a position he holds in ''The Teeth of the Tiger'' though he is never seen.  It is mentioned that Kealty's presidency only occurred "by accident," after Ryan's vice-president, Robby Jackson, who was presumably leading in the polls, was murdered by a fanatic white supremacist.

Ronald Reagan was the last actual President mentioned in the Ryanverse continuity; it is implied that ''Patriot Games'' and ''Red Rabbit'' occurred during his administration, though the President does not appear in either novel.  Historical dates after this are extremely clouded.  Working from dates determined above, we can assume that the unnamed President was in office between 1984 and 1988 (and Reagan's second term never occurred), while Fowler was president from 1988 to his resignation in 1991.  Durling and Ryan would then have been in office during the nineties, and Kealty in the 2000s.
