'''Crohn's disease''' (also known as '''regional enteritis''') is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], episodic, [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] condition of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] characterized by transmural inflammation (affecting the entire wall of the involved bowel) and skip lesions (areas of inflammation with areas of normal lining in between). Crohn's disease is a type of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD) and can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from [[mouth]] to [[anus]]; as a result, the symptoms of Crohn's disease can vary between affected individuals.  The main gastrointestinal symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhea, which may be bloody, and weight loss.  Crohn's disease can also cause complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract such as skin rashes, [[arthritis]], and [[Uveitis|inflammation of the eye]].<ref name=Hanauer>{{cite journal | last = Hanauer | first = Stephen B. | year = 1996 | month = March | title = Inflammatory bowel disease | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 334 | issue = 13 | pages = 841-848 | id = PMID 8596552 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/334/13/841 | accessdate = 2006-11-10}}</ref>

Although the cause of Crohn's disease is not known, it is widely believed to be an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disease]]. The condition occurs when the immune system contributes to damage of the gastrointestinal tract by causing inflammation.  Many [[cytokine]]s in the Th1 classification, including [[tumour necrosis factor|TNF-α]], [[interleukin]]-2, and [[interferon]] γ are elevated in Crohn's disease, and are involved in mediating the inflammation.<!--

The disease was named after [[Burrill Bernard Crohn]], an American [[gastroenterology|gastroenterologist]].  In [[1932]], Crohn and two colleagues first described a series of patients with inflammation of the [[terminal ileum]], the area most commonly affected in Crohn's disease.<ref name=CrohnBB>Crohn BB, Ginzburg L, Oppenheimer GD.  "Regional ileitis: a pathologic and clinical entity."  ''Mt Sinai J Med'' 2000 May;67(3):263-8.  PMID 10828911</ref>

==Classification==
[[Image:Distribution of CD.svg|right|thumb|250px|Distribution of gastrointestinal Crohn's disease.  Based on data from [[American Gastroenterological Association]].]]
Crohn's disease almost invariably affects the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, most gastroenterologists classify the disease by the affected areas. '''''Ileocolic Crohn's disease''''', which affects both the [[ileum]] (the last part of the [[small intestine]] that connects to the [[large intestine]]) and the large intestine, accounts for fifty percent of cases. '''''Crohn's ileitis''''', affecting the ileum only, accounts for thirty percent of cases, and '''''Crohn's colitis''''', affecting the large intestine, accounts for the remaining twenty percent of cases, and may be particularly difficult to distinguish from ulcerative colitis. The disease can attack any part of the digestive tract, from [[mouth]] to [[anus]]. However, individuals affected by the disease rarely fall outside these three classifications, being affected in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the [[stomach]] and [[esophagus]].<ref name=Hanauer/>

Crohn's disease may also be classified by the behaviour of disease as it progresses. This was formalized in the Vienna classification of Crohn's disease.<ref name=Vienna>{{cite journal | author = Gasche C, Scholmerich J, Brynskov J, D'Haens G, Hanauer S, Irvine E, Jewell D, Rachmilewitz D, Sachar D, Sandborn W, Sutherland L | title = A simple classification of Crohn's disease: report of the Working Party for the World Congresses of Gastroenterology, Vienna 1998 | journal = Inflamm Bowel Dis | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 8-15 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10701144}}</ref>  There are three categories of disease presentation in Crohn's disease: stricturing, penetrating, and inflammatory. ''Stricturing disease'' causes narrowing of the bowel which may lead to [[bowel obstruction]] or changes in the caliber of the [[feces]]. ''Penetrating disease'' creates abnormal passageways ([[fistula]]e) between the bowel and other structures such as the skin. ''Inflammatory disease'' (or non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease) causes inflammation without causing strictures or fistulae.<ref name=Vienna/><ref name=phenotypes>{{cite journal | author = Dubinsky MC, Fleshner PP. | title = Treatment of Crohn's Disease of Inflammatory, Stenotic, and Fistulizing Phenotypes. | journal = Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 183-200 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12744819}}</ref>

==Symptoms==

[[Image:CD serpiginous ulcer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Endoscopy image of [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] showing [[serpiginous]] ulcer, a classic finding in Crohn's disease]]
Many people with Crohn's disease have symptoms for years prior to the diagnosis.<ref name=Pimentel>{{cite journal | last = Pimentel | first = Mark | coauthors = Michael Chang, Evelyn J. Chow, Siamak Tabibzadeh, Viorelia Kirit-Kiriak, Stephan R. Targan, Henry C. Lin | year = 2000 | month = December | title = Identification of a prodromal period in Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis | journal = American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 3458-62 | doi =10.1111/j.1572-0241.2000.03361.x | id = PMID 11151877 }}</ref> The usual onset is between 15 and 30 years of age, with no difference between men and women. Because of the patchy nature of the gastrointestinal disease and the depth of tissue involvement, initial symptoms can be more vague than with ulcerative colitis. 

; Gastrointestinal symptoms
[[Abdominal pain]] may be the initial symptom of Crohn's disease. The pain is commonly [[cramp]]y and may be relieved by [[defecate|defecation]]. It is often accompanied by [[diarrhea]], which may be bloody. The nature of the diarrhea in Crohn's disease depends on the part of the small intestine or colon that is involved. Ileitis typically results in large-volume watery feces. Colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of higher frequency. Fecal consistency may range from solid to watery. In severe cases, an individual may have more than 20 [[bowel movements]] per day and may need to awaken at night to defecate.<ref name=Hanauer/><ref name=emed/><ref name=Podolsky/><ref>{{cite journal | last = Mueller | first = M.

In the setting of severe Crohn's colitis, bleeding may be copious.<ref name=emed/> [[Flatus]] and bloating may also add to the intestinal discomfort.<ref name=emed/> 

Symptoms caused by intestinal stenosis are also common in Crohn's disease. Abdominal pain is often most severe in areas of the bowel with stenoses. In the setting of severe stenosis, [[vomiting]] and [[nausea]] may indicate the beginnings of small [[bowel obstruction]].<ref name=emed>{{cite web|first= Latha|last= Gopal|coauthors=Senthil Nachimuthu|publisher=eMedicine|title=Crohn Disease|url=http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic477.htm|accessdate=2006-07-02|date=2006-05-23}}</ref> Crohn's disease may also be associated with [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], a type of inflammation of the bile ducts.

Peri-anal discomfort may also be prominent in Crohn's disease. Itchiness or pain around the [[anus]] may be suggestive of inflammation, [[fistula|fistulization]] or [[abscess]] around the anal area<ref name=Hanauer/> or [[anal fissure]]. Perianal skin [[acrochordon|tags]] are also common in Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Taylor B, Williams G, Hughes L, Rhodes J | title = The histology of anal skin tags in Crohn's disease: an aid to confirmation of the diagnosis | journal = Int J Colorectal Dis | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 197-9 | year = 1989 | id = PMID 2769004}}</ref> [[Fecal incontinence]] may accompany peri-anal Crohn's disease. At the opposite end of the gastrointestinal tract, the mouth may be affected by non-healing sores ([[aphthous ulcer]]s). Rarely, the [[esophagus]], and [[stomach]] may be involved in Crohn's disease. These can cause symptoms including  difficulty swallowing ([[odynophagia]]), upper abdominal pain, and vomiting.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fix | first = Oren K. | coauthors = Jorge A. Soto, Charles W. Andrews and Francis A.

;Systemic symptoms
Crohn's disease, like many other chronic, inflammatory diseases, can cause a variety of [[B symptoms|systemic symptoms]].<ref name=Hanauer/> Among children, [[growth failure]] is common. Many children are first diagnosed with Crohn's disease based on [[failure to thrive|inability to maintain growth]].<ref name=Beattie/>  As Crohn's disease may manifest at the time of the growth spurt in [[puberty]], up to 30% of children with Crohn's disease may have retardation of growth.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Büller | first = H.A. | year = 1997 | month = February | title = Problems in diagnosis of IBD in children | journal = The Netherlands Journal of Medicine  | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = S8-S11 | doi =10.1016/S0300-2977(96)00064-2 | id = PMID 9050326 }}</ref> Fever may also be present, though fevers greater than 38.5&nbsp;[[Celsius|˚C]] (101.3&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|˚F]]) are uncommon unless there is a complication such as an [[abscess]]<ref name=Hanauer/> Among older individuals, Crohn's disease may manifest as weight loss. This is usually related to decreased food intake, since individuals with intestinal symptoms from Crohn's disease often feel better when they do not eat.<ref name=Beattie>{{cite journal | last = Beattie | first = R.M. | coauthors = N. M. Croft, J. M. Fell, N. A. Afzal and R. B.

J. | year = 1996 | title = Nutrition and gastrointestinal disease | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology Supplement | issue = 220 | pages = 52-9 | id = PMID 8898436 }}</ref>

;Extraintestinal symptoms
In addition to systemic and gastrointestinal involvement, Crohn's disease can affect many other organ systems.<ref name=Danese>{{cite journal | last = Danese | first = Silvio  | coauthors = Stefano Semeraro, Alfredo Papa, Italia Roberto, Franco Scaldaferri, Giuseppe Fedeli, Giovanni Gasbarrini, Antonio Gasbarrini | year = 2005 | month = December | title = Extraintestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 11 | issue = 46 | pages = 7227-7236 | id = PMID 16437620 | url = http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/11/7227.asp | accessdate = 2006-07-02 }}</ref> Inflammation of the interior portion of the eye, known as [[uveitis]], can cause eye pain, especially when exposed to light ([[photophobia]]). Inflammation may also involve the white part of the eye ([[sclera]]), a condition called [[Scleritis|episcleritis]]. Both episcleritis and uveitis can lead to loss of vision if untreated.

Crohn's disease is associated with a type of [[Rheumatology|rheumatologic disease]] known as [[spondyloarthropathy|seronegative spondyloarthropathy]]. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more [[joint]]s ([[arthritis]]) or muscle insertions ([[enthesitis]]). The arthritis can affect larger joints such as the knee or shoulder or may exclusively involve the small joints of the hand and feet. The arthritis may also involve the spine, leading to [[ankylosing spondylitis]] if the entire spine is involved or simply [[sacroiliitis]] if only the lower spine is involved. The symptoms of arthritis include painful, warm, swollen, stiff joints and loss of joint mobility or function.

Crohn's disease may also involve the skin, blood, and [[endocrine system]]. One type of skin manifestation, [[erythema nodosum]], presents as red nodules usually appearing on the shins. Erythema nodosum is due to inflammation of the underlying subcutaneous tissue and is characterized by septal [[panniculitis]]. Another skin lesion, [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], is typically a painful ulcerating nodule. Crohn's disease also increases the risk of blood clots; painful swelling of the lower legs can be a sign of [[deep venous thrombosis]], while difficulty breathing may be a result of [[pulmonary embolism]]. [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]], a condition in which the immune system attacks the [[red blood cells]], is also more common in Crohn's disease and may cause fatigue, pallor, and other symptoms common in [[anemia]]. [[Clubbing]], a deformity of the ends of the fingers, may also be a result of Crohn's disease. Finally, Crohn's disease may cause [[osteoporosis]], or thinning of the bones. Individuals with osteoporosis are at increased risk of [[bone fracture]]s.<ref name=Bernstein>{{cite journal | last = Bernstein | first = Michael | coauthors = Sue Irwin and Gordon R. Greenberg | year = 2005 | month = September | title = Maintenance infliximab treatment is associated with improved bone mineral density in Crohn's disease | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 100 | issue = 9 | pages = 2031-5. | doi =10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.50219.x | id = PMID 16128948 }}</ref>

;Complications
[[Image:Colorectal cancer endo 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Colonoscopy|Endoscopic]] image of '''colon cancer''' identified in the sigmoid [[colon (anatomy)]] on screening [[colonoscopy]] for Crohn's disease.]]  
Crohn's disease can lead to several mechanical complications within the intestines, including obstruction, fistulae, and abscesses. Obstruction typically occurs from strictures or adhesions which narrow the lumen, blocking the passage of the intestinal contents. Fistulae can develop between two loops of bowel, between the bowel and bladder, between the bowel and vagina, and between the bowel and skin. Abscesses are walled off collections of [[infection]] and can occur in the [[abdomen]] or in the [[wiktionary:perianal|perianal]] area in Crohn's disease sufferers.

Crohn's disease also increases the risk of cancer in the area of inflammation. For example, individuals with Crohn's disease involving the [[small bowel]] are at higher risk for [[small intestinal cancer]]. Similarly, people with Crohn's colitis are at a higher risk for [[colon cancer]]. Screening for colon cancer with [[colonoscopy]] is recommended for anyone who has had Crohn's colitis for eight years, or more.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Collins P, Mpofu C, Watson A, Rhodes J | title = Strategies for detecting colon cancer and/or dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = | pages = CD000279 | year = | id = PMID 16625534}}</ref>

Individuals with Crohn's disease are at risk of [[malnutrition]] for many reasons, including decreased food intake and [[malabsorption]]. The risk increases following resection of the [[small bowel]]. Such individuals may require oral supplements to increase their caloric intake, or in severe cases, [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN). Most people with moderate or severe Crohn's disease are referred to a [[dietitian]] for assistance in nutrition.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Evans J, Steinhart A, Cohen Z, McLeod R | title = Home total parenteral nutrition: an alternative to early surgery for complicated inflammatory bowel disease | journal = J Gastrointest Surg | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 562–6 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12763417}}</ref>

Crohn's disease can also cause [[Toxic Megacolon]], a medical emergency requiring immediate decompression of the bowel. This is due to obstruction from inflammatory narrowing, causing massive distension of the bowel through food and gaseous buildup. [[Toxic Megacolon]] may also be a presenting symptom of Crohn's disease.

==Cause==

[[Image:NOD2 CARD15.svg|right|thumb|200px|Schematic of NOD2 CARD15 gene, which is associated with certain disease patterns in Crohn's disease]]

The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, genetic and environmental factors have been invoked in the [[pathogenesis]] of the disease. [[Mutation]]s in the [[CARD15]] gene (also known as the NOD2 [[gene]]) are associated with Crohn's disease<!-- 
--><ref>Ogura Y, Bonen DK, Inohara N, ''et al.''  A frameshift mutation in NOD2 associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease.  ''Nature''. 2001 May 31;411(6837):603-6.</ref> and with susceptibility to certain phenotypes of disease location and activity.<ref><!--

Many environmental factors have also been hypothesized as causes or risk factors for Crohn's disease. Diets high in sweet, [[fat|fatty]] or [[Food processing|refined foods]] may play a role. A retrospective Japanese study found that those diagnosed with Crohn's disease had higher intakes of sugar, fat, fish and shellfish than controls prior to diagnosis.<!--

Abnormalities in the immune system have often been invoked as being causes of Crohn's disease. It has been hypothesized that Crohn's disease involves augmentation of the [[T helper cell#Th1.2FTh2 Model for helper T cells|T<sub>h</sub>1]] of [[cytokine]] response in inflammation.<ref>Cobrin GM, Abreu MT. Defects in mucosal immunity leading to Crohn's disease.  ''Immunol Rev.'' 2005 Aug;206:277-95.

==Pathophysiology==

[[Image:Crohn's transmural path.jpg|thumb|right|120px|H and E section of [[colectomy]] showing transmural inflammation.]]

At the time of [[colonoscopy]], [[Biopsy|biopsies]] of the colon are often taken in order to confirm the diagnosis.  There are certain characteristic features of the [[pathology]] seen that point toward Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease shows a transmural pattern of [[inflammation]], meaning that the inflammation may span the entire depth of the intestinal wall.<ref name=Hanauer/> Grossly, [[Ulcer|ulceration]] is an outcome seen in highly active disease.  There is usually an abrupt transition between unaffected tissue and the ulcer. Under a microscope, biopsies of the affected colon may show [[Mucosa|mucosal]] inflammation. Transmural inflammation results in formation of [[lymphoid aggregate]]s throughout the wall of the colon. This inflammation is characterized by focal infiltration of [[neutrophils]], a type of inflammatory cell, into the [[epithelium]]. This typically occurs in the area overlying [[lymphoid tissue|lymphoid]] aggregates. These neutrophils, along with [[lymphocyte|mononuclear cells]], may infiltrate into the [[Crypts of Lieberkuhn|crypts]] leading to inflammation (crypititis) or abscess (crypt abscess).  [[Granuloma]]s, aggregates of [[macrophage]] derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn's disease. The granulomas of Crohn's disease do not show "caseation", a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination that is characteristic of granulomas associated with infections such as [[tuberculosis]]. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal [[villus|villi]], atypical branching of the crypts, and change in the tissue type ([[metaplasia]]). One example of such metaplasia, ''Paneth cell metaplasia'', involves development of Paneth cells (typically found in the small intestine) in other parts of the gastrointestinal system.<ref name=Robbins>Crawford JM.

The diagnosis of Crohn's disease can sometimes be challenging,<ref name=Pimentel/> and a number of tests are often required to assist the physician in making the diagnosis.<ref name=emed/>

;Endoscopy
A [[colonoscopy]] is the best test for making the diagnosis of Crohn's disease as it allows direct visualization of the colon and the [[terminal ileum]], identifying the pattern of disease involvement. During the procedure, the [[gastroenterologist]] can also perform a [[biopsy]], taking small samples of tissue for laboratory analysis which may help confirm a diagnosis.  As 30% of Crohn's disease involves only the ileum,<ref name=Hanauer/> [[cannula|cannulation]] of the terminal ileum is required in making the diagnosis. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum but not the [[rectum]], is suggestive of Crohn's disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata.<!--

[[Wireless capsule endoscopy]] is a technique where a small capsule with a built-in camera is swallowed, the camera takes serial pictures of the entire gastrointestinal tract and is passed in the patient's faeces.  It has been used in the search for Crohn's disease in the small bowel, which cannot be reached with colonoscopy or gastroscopy.<!--

;Radiologic tests
A [[barium follow-through|small bowel follow-through]] may suggest the diagnosis of Crohn's disease and is useful when the disease involves only the small intestine. Because colonoscopy and [[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscopy]] allow direct visualization of only the terminal ileum and beginning of the [[duodenum]], they cannot be used to evaluate the remainder of the small intestine. As a result, a [[barium follow-through]] x-ray, wherein [[barium sulfate]] suspension is ingested and [[fluoroscopy|fluoroscopic]] images of the bowel are taken over time, is useful for looking for inflammation and narrowing of the small bowel.<!--

===Comparison with ulcerative colitis===
The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of Crohn's disease is [[ulcerative colitis]], as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as '''indeterminate colitis'''.<ref name=Podolsky/><ref name=Hanauer/><ref name=emed/>

==Treatment==

{{sync|Treatment of Crohn's disease}}
{{main|Treatment of Crohn's disease|Biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease}}
Treatment is only needed for people exhibiting symptoms. The therapeutic approach to Crohn's disease is sequential: to treat [[acute (medical)|acute]] disease, and then to maintain [[remission]]. Treatment initially involves the use of medications to treat any infection and to reduce inflammation. This usually involves the use of aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids, and may include antibiotics. [[Surgery]] may be required for complications such as obstructions or abscesses, or if the disease does not respond to drugs within a reasonable time.

Once remission is induced, the goal of treatment becomes maintenance of remission, avoiding flares. Because of side-effects, the prolonged use of corticosteroids must be avoided. Although some people are able to maintain remission with aminosalicylates alone, many require immunosuppressive drugs.<ref name="HanauerCrohns"/>

;Drugs
[[Image:Infliximab structure2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The anti-[[tumor necrosis factor|TNF-α]] [[monoclonal antibody]] [[infliximab]] is a mainstay of the '''biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease''']]

Various drug approaches may be used in Crohn's disease to both obtain and maintain remission.  [[Aminosalicylate]] [[anti-inflammatory]] drugs commonly prescribed are [[mesalazine]] (mesalamine, 5-ASA) and the derivative [[sulfasalazine]]. The [[corticosteroid]]s [[prednisone]] and [[budesonide]] are [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressants]], as well as [[azathioprine]] (Imuran), [[6-mercaptopurine]] (6-MP), [[infliximab]] (Remicade®), [[methotrexate]].  Rarely, atypical medications such as [[thalidomide]] can be used.<ref>Cohen LB.  Re: Disappearance of Crohn's ulcers in the terminal ileum after thalidomide therapy. Can J Gastroenterol 2004; 18(2): 101-104.  ''Can J Gastroenterol''. 2004 Jun;18(6):419.  PMID 15230268.</ref> The [[antibiotic]]s [[metronidazole]] and [[ciprofloxacin]] may also be used for people with colonic disease.

;Surgery
Surgery is generally reserved for complications of Crohn's disease, or when disease that resists treatment with drugs is confined to one location that can be removed.<ref name=Hanauer/> Surgery is often used to manage complications of Crohn's disease, including fistulae, small [[bowel obstruction]], [[colon cancer]], [[small intestine cancer]] and fibrostenotic [[stricture]]s, when strictureplasty (expansion of the stricture) is sometimes performed. Otherwise, and for other complications, [[Resection#Surgery|resection]] and anastomosis - the removal of the affected section of intestine and the rejoining of the healthy sections - is the surgery usually performed for Crohn's disease (e.g., [[Colectomy|ileocolonic resection]]). Neither type of surgery cures Crohn's disease, as recurrence often reappears in previously unaffected areas of the intestine.<ref name=CCFA-surgery>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccfa.org/info/surgery/surgerycd| title=Surgery for Crohn's Disease| year=2006| month=March| accessdate=2006-06-08 |publisher=Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America}}</ref>

Small intestine [[Organ transplant|transplants]] are experimental, and are usually only performed when there is a risk of [[short bowel syndrome]] due to repeated resection surgeries.

;Diet and lifestyle
There is no evidence that [[diet]] causes or cures Crohn's disease, but many people with Crohn's disease note that certain foods improve or worsen their symptoms.  [[Fish oil]] has been found to be effective in reducing the chance of relapse in less severe cases.<!--
--><ref>{{cite journal | author =  A Belluzzi, C Brignola, M Campieri, A Pera, S Boschi, and M Miglioli | year = 1996 | month = June | title = Effect of an Enteric-Coated Fish-Oil Preparation on Relapses in Crohn's Disease | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 334 | issue = 24 | pages = 1557-60 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/334/24/1557?ijkey=6460c4103d06d06d427a2779ed0d755c3a7671cc&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha}}</ref><!--
-->  People with [[lactose intolerance]] due to small bowel disease may benefit from avoiding [[lactose]]-containing foods.  Many diets have been proposed for treatment of Crohn's disease, and many do improve symptoms, but none have been proven to actually cure Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite book | last = Gottschall | first = Elaine | year = 1994 | title = Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet | publisher = Kirkton Press | location = Baltimore | id = ISBN 0-9692768-1-8}}</ref>  A [[low residue diet]] may be used to reduce the volume of stools excreted daily. [[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] can make symptoms of Crohn's disease worse. People with Crohn's disease can find that their symptoms improve with effective [[stress management]].

Because the terminal ileum is the most common site of involvement and is the site for [[Cyanocobalamin|vitamin B{{ssub|12}}]] absorption, people with Crohn's disease are at risk for B{{ssub|12}} deficiency and may need supplementation. In cases with extensive small intestine involvement, the fat soluble vitamins [[Retinol|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Tocopherol|E]] and [[Naphthoquinone|K]] can be deficient. [[Folate deficiency]] is a risk when being treated with methotrexate.

;Complementary and alternative medicine
More than half of Crohn's disease sufferers have tried complementary or alternative therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Caprilli R, Gassull M, Escher J ''et al'' | title = European evidence based consensus on the diagnosis and management of Crohn's disease: special situations | journal = Gut | volume = 55 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = i36-58 | year = | id = PMID 16481630}}</ref> These include diets, [[probiotics]], fish oil and other [[Herbalism|herbal]] and nutritional supplements. The benefit of these medications is uncertain.

==Prognosis==

Crohn's disease is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] condition that cannot be cured. It is characterized by periods of improvement followed by episodes when symptoms flare up. With treatment, most people achieve a healthy height and weight, and the mortality rate for the disease is low. Crohn's disease is associated with an increased risk of small bowel and colorectal carcinoma.

==History==

Inflammatory bowel diseases were described by [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]] (1682-1771), by Polish surgeon Antoni Leśniowski in 1904 (leading to the use of the eponym "'''Leśniowski-Crohn disease'''" in [[Poland]]) and by [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician T. Kennedy Dalziel in 1913.<ref>Kirsner JB.  Historical aspects of inflammatory bowel disease.  ''J Clin Gastroenterol.'' 1988 Jun;10(3):286-97.  PMID 2980764</ref>

[[Burrill Bernard Crohn]], an American gastroenterologist at [[Mount Sinai Hospital]], described fourteen cases in 1932, and submitted them to the [[American Medical Association]] under the rubric of "Terminal ileitis: A new clinical entity".  Later that year, he, along with colleagues Leon Ginzburg and Gordon Oppenheimer published the case series as "Regional ileitis: a pathologic and clinical entity".<ref name=CrohnBB/>
