The contemporaneously ''de facto'' independent republics of [[Abkhazia]] and South Ossetia, as well as [[Transnistria]], [[Commonwealth of Unrecognized States|recognized each other's independence]] on 17 November 2006.

Since the [[2008 South Ossetian war|Russian-Georgian war of 2008]] two UN member states have recognised South Ossetia's independence, and several other UN members and unrecognized entities have also expressed a willingness to do so at a future date. The first member of the [[United Nations]] to [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|recognize South  Ossetia]] was the [[Russian Federation]] on 26 August 2008, followed by [[Nicaragua]] on 5 September.

Parallel to the secessionist held referendum and elections, the Ossetian opposition movement ([[People of South Ossetia for Peace]]) to [[Eduard Kokoity]], the current [[President of South Ossetia]], organized their own elections in which Georgian and some Ossetian inhabitants of the region voted in favour of [[Dmitry Sanakoyev]] as the alternative President of South Ossetia.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=279 Two Referendums and Two “Presidents” in South Ossetia - CAUCAZ.COM<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The alternative elections of Sanakoyev claimed full support of the ethnic Georgian population.

==History==
===Medieval and early modern period===
The [[Ossetians]] are originally descendants of the [[Alans]], a [[Sarmatian]] tribe. They became [[Christian]]s during the early [[Middle Ages]], under  [[Byzantine]] and Georgian influences. Under [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] rule, they were pushed out of their medieval homeland south of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] in present-day Russia and part migrated towards and over the [[Caucasus]] mountains (into the kingdom of Georgia and into the lands of present-day [[North Ossetia-Alania]]),<ref>[[David Marshall Lang]], The Georgians, New York, p. 239 </ref> where they formed three distinct territorial entities. [[Digor (people)|Digor]] in the west came under the influence of the neighboring [[Kabard]] people, who introduced [[Islam]]. Kudar in the south became what is now South Ossetia, part of the historical Georgian principality of [[Samachablo]]<ref>Roger Rosen, History of Caucasus Nations, London, 2006 </ref> where Ossetians found refuge from Mongol invaders. Iron in the north became what is now [[North Ossetia]], under Russian rule from 1767. The vast majority of the Ossetians are [[Orthodox Christians]]; there is also a significant Muslim minority.

===South Ossetia as a part of Russia and the Soviet Union===
[[Image:Ossetia-map.png|250px|thumb|Former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast is grey. It is officially divided by Georgian authorities between different administrative units.]]
The modern-day South Ossetia was annexed by Russia in 1801, along with Georgia proper, and absorbed into the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the Russian Revolution, South Ossetia became a part of the [[Menshevik]] [[Georgian Democratic Republic]], while the North Ossetia became a part of the [[Terek Soviet Republic]]. "The Georgian Menshevik government accused Ossetians of cooperating with Russian [[Bolsheviks]]. A [[Georgian-Ossetian conflict (1918-1920)|series of Ossetian rebellions]] took place between 1918 and 1920 during which claims were made to an independent territory. Violence broke out in 1920 when Georgian Mensheviks sent National Guards and regular army units to Tskhinvali to crush the uprisings. Ossetian sources claim that about 5,000 Ossetians were killed and more than 13,000 subsequently died from hunger and epidemics"<ref name=icg>{{citation|publisher=[[International Crisis Group]]|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UNTC/UNPAN019224.pdf|format=PDF|url2=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=3128&l=1|title=Georgia: Avoiding War in South Ossetia|id=ICG Europe Report 159|date=26 November 2004|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

The Soviet Georgian government established by the Russian 11th [[Red Army]] in 1921 created the '''[[South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast]]''' (i.e., province) in April 1922. Although the Ossetians had their own language ([[Ossetic language|Ossetian]]), Russian  and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]  were administrative/state languages.<ref name="autogenerated2"> D.M. Lang, History of Modern Georgia, 1963 </ref> Under the rule of Georgia's government during Soviet times, it enjoyed some degree of autonomy including speaking the [[Ossetic language|Ossetian]] language and teaching it in schools.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

[[Image:SO2.jpg|thumb|200px|Hatched shading shows Georgian-controlled areas in South Ossetia in June 2007 (according to Tbilisi, Georgia).<ref>[[#CG2007|Crisis group 2007 Appendix D]]</ref>]]
[[Image:Pmt.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The monument to the victims of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict in [[Tskhinvali]]]]

The tensions in the region began to rise amid the rising nationalism among both Georgians and Ossetians in 1989. Before this, the two communities of the [[South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast]] of [[Georgian SSR]] had been living in peace with each other except for the [[Georgian-Ossetian conflict (1918-1920)|1918-1920 events]]. Both ethnicities have had a high level of interaction and high rates of [[intermarriage]]s.

The influential South Ossetian Popular Front (''Ademon Nykhas'') was created in 1988. On 10 November 1989, the South Ossetian regional council asked the Georgian Supreme Council (in Russian: Верховный Совет Грузии) for the region to be upgraded to that of "[[Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union|autonomous republic]]". In 1989 the Georgian Supreme Council established [[Georgian language|Georgian]] as the principal language countrywide.<ref name=icg/>

The Georgian Supreme Council adopted a law barring regional parties in summer 1990. This was interpreted by Ossetians as a move against Ademon Nykhas and led to Ossetians proclaiming South Ossetia as the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|South Ossetian Democratic Republic]] on September 20, 1990,<ref>http://www.caucasus.dk/chapter8.htm</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972214,00.html Hastening The End of the Empire], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 28 January 1991</ref> fully sovereign within the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR). Ossetians boycotted subsequent Georgian parliamentary elections and held their own contest in December. The Georgian government headed by [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] declared this election illegitimate and abolished South Ossetia's autonomous status altogether on 11 December 1990.<ref name=icg/>

[[1991–1992 South Ossetia War|Violent conflict]] broke out towards the end of 1991 during which many South Ossetian villages were attacked and burned down as were Georgian houses and schools in Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia. As a result, approximately 1,000 died and about 100,000 ethnic Ossetians fled the territory and Georgia proper, most across the border into North Ossetia. A further 23,000 ethnic Georgians fled South Ossetia and settled in other parts of Georgia.<ref> Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, [http://hrw.org/reports/1996/Russia.htm RUSSIA. THE INGUSH-OSSETIAN CONFLICT IN THE PRIGORODNYI REGION], May 1996.</ref> Many South Ossetians were resettled in uninhabited areas of North Ossetia from which the [[Ingush people|Ingush]] had been expelled by [[Stalin]] in 1944, leading to conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush over the right of residence in former Ingush territory.

The western part of South Ossetia was affected by the [[1991 Racha-Java earthquake]], which killed 200 and left 300 families homeless.

In 1992, Georgia accepted a [[Sochi agreement|ceasefire]] to avoid a large scale confrontation with Russia. The government of Georgia and South Ossetian separatists reached an agreement to avoid the use of force against one another, and Georgia pledged not to impose sanctions against South Ossetia. However, the Georgian government still retained control over substantial portions of South Ossetia, including the town of [[Akhalgori]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10225052&CFID=23834221&CFTOKEN=38924298 The independence precedent: If Kosovo goes free] The Economist, Nov 29th 2007 </ref> A peacekeeping force of Ossetians, Russians and Georgians was established. On 6 November 1992, the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) set up a Mission in Georgia to monitor the peacekeeping operation. From then until mid-2004 South Ossetia was generally peaceful. In June 2004, serious tensions began to rise as the Georgian authorities strengthened their efforts to bring the region back under Tbilisi rule, and established an alternative government pro-Georgian government for South Ossetia in Tbilisi. <ref name=icg2007/> Hostage takings, shootouts and occasional bombings left dozens dead and wounded. A ceasefire deal was reached on 13 August though it was repeatedly violated. Presently the situation is tense with war escalating. Moscow and Tskhinvali viewed the recent [[Georgian military]] build-up with concern.

[[Image:047 South Ossetia war.JPG|200px|thumb|Georgian Snipers in South Ossetia]]

====2008 War====
{{Main|2008 South Ossetia war}}
The prelude to the conflict began with violent clashes on Wednesday, 6 August 2008 with both sides claiming having been fired upon by the other. The Georgian interior ministry indicated Georgian forces had returned fire only after South Ossetian positions shelled Georgian-controlled villages and accused the South Ossetian side of "trying to create an illusion of serious escalation, an illusion of war."<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2008/08/200886171817421680.html Aljazeera.net] report from multiple news agencies.</ref> South Ossetia denied provoking the conflict.<ref name="ref1">[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18871 Six Die in S.Ossetia Shootout], ''Civil Georgia'', 2 August 2008.

On 4 August 2008, five [[battalion]]s of the Russian [[58th Army (Soviet Union)|58th Army]] (approx. 5.500 men) were moved to the vicinity of the [[Roki Tunnel]] that links South Ossetia with North Ossetia.<ref name="august_4_2008_58army">{{cite web|url=http://www.tol.cz/look/TOL/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=4&NrIssue=281&NrSection=1&NrArticle=19821|title=''Talking Through Gritted Teeth''.

On 7 August, Georgian and Ossetian forces agreed on a ceasefire<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7551576.stm] ''Day-by-day: Georgia-Russia crisis''</ref>.

In the first hours of 8 August 2008, a massive attack by Georgian troops, armour and airforce commenced on South Ossetian-controlled territory, plus repeated artillery shelling of the capital, [[Tskhinvali]], with [[multiple rocket launcher]]s.<ref>[http://lenta.ru/articles/2008/08/08/ossetia/] ''Chronicle of the Second South-Ossetian War'', in Russian</ref> <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/08/russia.georgia1 ''Analysis: Georgia's decision to shell Tskhinvali could prove 'reckless''', Guardian]</ref> <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7571096.stm ''Ossetian crisis: Who started it?'', BBC]</ref> On the same day, twelve Russian peacekeepers were killed and nearly 150 injured.<ref>[http://lenta.ru/news/2008/08/08/more/] ''In Tskhinvali killed 15 peacemakers'', in Russian</ref>

At least one former Georgian government official has testified that Georgia started the war with the approval of the United States government. [[Erosi Kitsmarishvili]], Georgia's former ambassador to Moscow and a confidant of President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], testified to the [[Parliament of Georgia]] that Georgian officials told him in April 2008 that they planned to start a war in Abkhazia, one of two breakaway regions at issue in the war, and had received a green light from the United States government to do so. He said the Georgian government later decided to start the war in South Ossetia, the other region, and continue into Abkhazia.<ref>New York Times, 25 November 2008, "Ex-Diplomat Says Georgia Started War With Russia" http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/europe/26georgia.html</ref> 

The Russian Prime-Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] said that the Russian Government condemns the "aggressive actions" by Georgian troops in South Ossetia<ref>{{cite news

The following day, Russia deployed forces into South Ossetia to remove Georgian forces from South Ossetia. Additionally, Russia targeted Georgia's military infrastructure to reduce Georgia's ability to conduct another incursion.

On 22 August, following a negotiated cease-fire between Georgia and Russia, Russia pulled its forces back to Russia and South Ossetia, leaving military contingents disbursed throughout various areas as observation and security posts. These were withdrawn by [[8 October]].

==Politics==
South Ossetia consists of a checkerboard of Georgian-inhabited and Ossetian-inhabited towns and villages.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Until the [[2008 South Ossetia war|armed conflict of August 2008]], the largely Ossetian capital city of [[Tskhinvali]] and most of the other Ossetian-inhabited communities were governed by the separatist government, while the Georgian-inhabited villages and towns were administered by the Georgian government. This close proximity and the intermixing of the two communities has made the [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict]] particularly dangerous, since any attempt to create an ethnically pure territory would involve [[population transfer]]s on a large scale.

The political dispute has yet to be resolved and the South Ossetian separatist authorities govern the region with effective independence from Tbilisi. Although talks have been held periodically between the two sides, little progress was made under the government of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] (1993–2003). His successor [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] (elected 2004) made the reassertion of Georgian governmental authority a political priority. Having successfully put an end to the ''de facto'' independence of the southwestern province of [[Ajaria]] in May 2004, he pledged to seek a similar solution in South Ossetia. After the 2004 clashes, the Georgian government has intensified its efforts to bring the problem to international attention. On 25 January 2005, President Saakashvili presented a Georgian vision for resolving the South Ossetian conflict at the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) session in [[Strasbourg]]. Late in October, the [[U.S. Government]] and the OSCE expressed their support to the Georgian action plan presented by Prime Minister [[Zurab Noghaideli]] at the OSCE Permanent Council at [[Vienna]] on 27 October 2005. On 6 December, the OSCE Ministerial Council in [[Ljubljana]] adopted a resolution supporting the Georgian peace plan<ref>OSCE, 13th Meeting of the Ministerial Council (5 and 6 December 2005). Statement on Georgia (MC.DOC/4/05)</ref> which was subsequently rejected by the South Ossetian ''de facto'' authorities.

===Republic of South Ossetia===
On September 11, 2006, the South Ossetian Information and Press Committee announced that the republic would hold an [[South Ossetian independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]]<ref name="autogenerated4" /> (the first referendum  had not been recognized by the international community as valid in 1992<ref>Civil Georgia, [S.Ossetia Sets Repeat Independence Referendum http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=13522], 2006-09-11</ref>) on 12 November 2006. The voters would decide on whether or not South Ossetia "should preserve its present de facto status of an independent state". Georgia denounced the move as a "political absurdity". However, on 13 September 2006, the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) Secretary General [[Terry Davis (politician)|Terry Davis]] commented on the problem, stating that it would be unlikely that anyone would accept the results of this referendum and instead urged South Ossetian government to engage in the negotiations with Georgia.<ref>[http://portal.coe.ge/enews/EEVlEuyFElfTRjjwgP.php ''Council of Europe Secretary General calls for talks instead of "referendum" in the Georgian region of South Ossetia.''] Council of Europe Information Office in Georgia. Retrieved on 13-09-2006.</ref> On 13 September 2006 [[European Union]] Special Representative to the [[South Caucasus]], [[Peter Semneby]], while visiting [[Moscow]], said: "''results of the South Ossetian independence referendum will have no meaning for the European Union''".<ref>[http://207.44.135.100/eng/article.php?id=13544 Online Magazine - Civil Georgia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Peter Semneby also added that this referendum would not contribute to the peaceful conflict resolution process in South Ossetia.

South Ossetians nearly unanimously approved a referendum on 12 November 2006 opting for independence from Georgia. The referendum was hugely popular, winning between 98 and 99 percent of the ballots, flag waving and celebration marked were seen across South Ossetia, but elsewhere observers were less enthusiastic.  International critics claimed that the move could worsen regional tensions, and the Tbilisi government thoroughly discounted the results.<!--The ref doesn't work   "Everybody needs to understand, once and for all, that no amount of referenda or elections will move Georgia to give up that which belongs to the Georgian people by God's will," declared [[Georgi Tsagareishvili]], leader of the Industrialist’s bloc in Georgia's parliament.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20061113/ts_afp/georgiaossetiarussiavote_061113163056] [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] by Simon Ostrovsky, retrieved 13 November 2006.</ref> -->

The [[People of South Ossetia for Peace]] was founded in October 2006 by the ethnic Ossetians who were outspoken critics and presented a serious opposition to secessionist authorities of Eduard Kokoity.

The group headed by the former defence minister and then prime minister of secessionist government [[Dmitry Sanakoyev]] organized the so-called alternative presidential election, on 12 November 2006– parallel to those held by the secessionist authorities in Tskhinvali.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> High voter turnout was reported by the alternative electoral commission, which estimated over 42,000 voters from both Ossetian (Java district and Tskhinvali) and Georgian (Eredvi, Tamarasheni, etc.) communities of South Ossetia and Sanakoyev reportedly received 96% of the votes. Another referendum was organized shortly after asking for the start of negotiations with Georgia on a federal arrangement for South Ossetia received 94% support. However, People of South Ossetia for Peace turned down a request from a Georgian NGO, “Multinational Georgia”, to monitor it and the released results were very likely to be inflated.<ref name=icg2007>[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4887&l=1 Georgia’s South Ossetia Conflict: Make Haste Slowly], Europe Report N°183, 7 June 2007 (free registration needed to view full report)</ref>

According to the [[International Crisis Group]], "Georgian government’s steps are non-violent and development-oriented but their implementation is unilateral and so assertive that they are contributing to a perceptible and dangerous rise in tensions".<ref name=icg2007/>

Initially the entity of Sanakoyev was known as "the Alternative Government of South Ossetia", but during the course of 2007 the central authorities of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] decided to give it official status and on 13 April the formation of "Provisional Administration of South Ossetia" was announced.<ref>[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14944 Online Magazine - Civil Georgia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 10 May 2007 Dmitry Sanakoyev was appointed head of the provisional administrative entity in South Ossetia.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15089 Online Magazine - Civil Georgia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the Georgian-Ossetian War 2008 Dmitry Sanakoyev was cooperating with the Georgian Government and supported actions of the Georgian military.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

An EU fact finding team visited the region in January 2007. [[Per Eklund(diplomat)|Per Eklund]], Head of the [[Delegation of the European Community to Georgia]][http://www.delgeo.ec.europa.eu/] said that “None of the two alternatives do we consider legitimate [in South Ossetia].”<ref>[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14488 Online Magazine - Civil Georgia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Osetia Południowa.png|thumb|Topographic map of South Ossetia. ([[Polish orthography|Polish]] transcription)]]
South Ossetia covers an area of about 3,900 km² on the southern side of the [[Caucasus]], separated by the mountains from the more populous [[North Ossetia]] (part of Russia) and extending southwards almost to the [[Mtkvari]] river in Georgia. It is extremely mountainous, with most of the region lying over 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level. Its economy is primarily agricultural, although less than 10% of South Ossetia's land area is cultivated. Cereals, fruit and vines are the major produce. Forestry and cattle industries are also maintained. A number of industrial facilities also exist, particularly around the capital [[Tskhinvali]].

==Demographics==
Before the [[Georgian-Ossetian conflict]] roughly two-thirds of the population of South Ossetia was [[Ossetians|Ossetian]] and 25-30% was [[Georgian people|Georgian]]. The eastern quarter of the country, around the town of Akhalgori, is predominantly Georgian, while the center and west are predominantly Ossete. Much of the mountainous north is scarcely inhabited. (See map at [[Languages of the Caucasus]].) 

Because the statistical office of Georgia was not able to conduct the 2002 Georgian census in South Ossetia, the present composition of the population of South Ossetia is unknown,<ref>G. Tsuladze, N. Maglaperidze, A. Vadachkoria, Eds.,''Demographic Yearbook of Georgia: 2001'', Georgian Academy of Sciences: Institute of Demographic and Sociological Research (Tbilisi, 2002).  This source reports that in January 2002 there were 37,000 Ossetians living in Georgia but excluding South Ossetia.</ref> although according to some estimates there were 45,000 ethnic Ossetians and 17,500 ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia in 2007.<ref> The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use.

==Economy==
Following a war with Georgia in the 1990s, South Ossetia has struggled economically. Employment and supplies are scarce. Additionally, Georgia cut off supplies of electricity to the region, which forced the South Ossetian government to run an electric cable through North Ossetia. The majority of the population survives on subsistence farming. Virtually the only significant economic asset that South Ossetia possesses is control of the [[Roki Tunnel]] that used to link Russia and Georgia, from which the South Ossetian government reportedly obtains as much as a third of its budget by levying customs duties on freight traffic.

In late 2006, a large international counterfeiting operation stretching from South Ossetia was revealed by [[U.S. Secret Service]] and Georgian police.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/25/AR2006112500963.html Probe Traces Global Reach of Counterfeiting Ring].

South Ossetian GDP was estimated at US$ 15 million (US$ 250 per capita) in a work published in 2002.<ref>Mamuka Areshidze, "Current Economic Causes of Conflict in Georgia", unpublished report for UK Department for International Development (DFID), 2002.
