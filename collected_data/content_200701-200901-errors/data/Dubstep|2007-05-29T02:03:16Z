'''Dubstep''' is a genre of music, originally comprised of elements of the largely [[South London]]-based [[UK garage#2-step|2-step]]<ref name="teleg">[The Daily Telegraph 14 Oct 2006: ''Put a bit of dub in your step: a new form of dance music from Croydon is ready to conquer the world'' by Gervase de Wilde]</ref>, as well as elements of [[dub reggae]]<ref name="plasticman">{Interview with [[The Plastician|Plasticman]] on [http://riddim.ca riddim.ca]</ref>; however the genre has quickly incorporated other influences. Characteristics of the genre include [[subbass]], and heavily [[syncopation|syncopated]], yet often sparse [[rhythm]]s, often [[swung note|shuffled]] or incorporating [[tuplet|triplets]]. The rise of dubstep as a genre was noted by the [[Daily Telegraph]] in October 2006; it described dubstep as ''"the latest development in British dance music... yet another sound stemming from London's garage scene, a bass-heavy instrumental form rather confusingly known as Dubstep."''<ref name="teleg">[The Daily Telegraph 14 Oct 2006: ''Put a bit of dub in your step: a new form of dance music from Croydon is ready to conquer the world'' by Gervase de Wilde]</ref>. Interest in dubstep grew when the [[BBC Radio 1]] [[Disk jockey#Radio disk jockeys|DJ]] [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] discovered it through the DMZ club night in Brixton, south London.<ref name="teleg">[The Daily Telegraph 14 Oct 2006: ''Put a bit of dub in your step: a new form of dance music from Croydon is ready to conquer the world'' by Gervase de Wilde]</ref>

The first reference to dubstep as a genre, or sub-genre, by the UK national press came early in 2004. [[The Independent on Sunday]] commented on a 'whole new sound', that ''it'' said consisted of five genres: ''"The music that's emerging is so new, inventive and atomised, it doesn't have one name but five. 'Eightbar', 'sublow', 'dubstep', 'eski' and, most prominently, 'grime', are all being touted as descriptors of a uniquely British music that descends from the garage sound that launched [[Ms. Dynamite]], [[Mis-Teeq]] and [[So Solid Crew]]."''<ref name="IOS">[The Indpependent on Sunday 22 Feb 2004: ''Partners in Grime'' by Kevin Braddock]</ref>.  By April 2005, the Dubstep club night ''Forward>>'' was being listed in the national press.<ref>[The Times: ''Forward; Hit or hype?'' 9 Apr 2005 by Alex MacPherson ]</ref> 

== Origins and early Dubstep ==
The sound originally came out of productions by [[El-B]] (as part of both Groove Chronicles with Noodles and then the Ghost camp), [[Zed Bias]], [[Horsepower Productions]] and [[Steve Gurley]] in [[1999]]-[[2000]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The dubstep sound is characterised by the prevalence of [[sub-bass]], heavily [[syncopated]] rhythms, and [[reggae]] or [[movie]] samples, amongst other influences.  Like another garage hybrid, [[grime]], the genre uses dark sounds, but differs from grime in being largely instrumental.

The term 'dubstep' was coined by Ammunition Promotions{{Fact|date=April 2007}} and first used on an [[XLR8R]] magazine cover that featured [[Horsepower Productions]]. It gained full acceptance with the Dubstep Allstars Vol 1 CD ([[Tempa]]) mixed by DJ [[Hatcha]]. Since [[2001]], Ammunition have been responsible for a raft of labels such as Tempa, Soulja, Road, Vehicle, Shelflife, Texture, Stealth People, Bingo and more - though to date only Soulja, Bingo, Road and Tempa remain active.

Another crucial element in the development of dubstep was the [[Big Apple Records]] [[record shop]] in [[Croydon]]. Many key artists, including [[Skream]] and [[Benga (artist)|Benga]] either worked or socialised in the shop (which initially sold [[jungle (music)|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]], but evolved with the emerging dubstep scene in the area) ''<ref name="wire279">[http://www.thewire.co.uk/current/index.php ''The Wire'' magazine, issue 279: ''The Primer:Dubstep'']</ref>.

== Forward>> ==
Ammunition also run club ''Forward>>'', originally held at the Velvet Rooms in London's [[Soho]] and now running every Friday at Plastic People in [[Shoreditch]], [[East London, England|east London]]. Founded in 2001, this club was critical in the development of dubstep, providing the first venue devoted to the sound and an environment in which producers could premier new music. Forward>> also ran a radio show on east London pirate station [[Rinse FM]], hosted by producer/DJ Kode9, owner of the pioneering [[Hyperdub]] label. The original ''Forward>>'' residents included Hatcha, Youngsta, Kode9, Zed Bias, Oris Jay, [[Slaughter Mob]], Jay Da Flex, [[Slimzee]] and others and plus regular guests. The line up of residents has changed over the years to now include Youngsta, Hatcha, Geeneus and [[Plastician]] and Crazy D as MC/host. Producers including D1, [[Skream]] and [[Benga (artist)|Benga]] make regular appearances.

''Forward>>'' also incubated several other strains of dark garage hybrids, so much so that in the early days of the club the coming together of the three strains was referred to as the "''Forward>>'' sound". One style of early grime, then called '8bar', was played here by DJs like Slimzee (then of Pay As U Go, now part of Rinse FM). This style allowed producers like Croydon's Plasticman (now known as Plastician) and Manchester's Mark One to come through with their own takes on the grime sound. Breakbeat garage ( a darker, breakier sound, see below) was pioneered here. The summer of 2005 saw ''Forward>>'' bring grime DJs to the fore of the line up with [[Roll Deep]], Jammer, Geeneus, Newham Generals performing with their respective MCs. 

''Forward>>'' also attracted the attention of Rinse FM DJs, who around 2003 opened up their schedule to dubstep DJs during a time where the traditional garage scene had turned its back on the sound. Rinse FM strengthened the connection between dubstep and its urban London surroundings, while also allowing the scene to incubate new ideas.

== Dubstep today ==
Throughout [[2003]] on Rinse FM and through his sets at ''Forward>>'', DJ Hatcha began pioneering a new direction for dubstep, one that was to finally establish the scene as a new sound. Playing sets cut to 10" one-off reggae-style [[dubplate]]s, he drew exclusively from a pool of new South London producers - first Benga and Skream, then also [[Digital Mystikz]] and [[Loefah]] - to pioneer a dark, clipped and minimal new direction in dubstep. The addition of Digital Mystikz to Hatcha sets brought with them an expanded palate of sounds and influences, most prominently reggae and dub, but also strange mystical melodies.

Another key turning point for the scene was the two misnamed 'Grime' compilations put together by  [[Rephlex]] in 2004 (assisted by Ammunition). Featuring Plasticman, Mark One and Slaughter Mob on the first volume, and Kode 9, Loefah and Digital Mystikz on the second, it introduced the different flavours to the global [[electronica]] audience, the repercussions of which can be seen in current productions and club nights. 

The south London collective [[Digital Mystikz]] (Mala and Coki) and Loefah soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, [[dub music|dub]] values, and appreciation of [[Drum n bass|jungle]] bass weight to the dubstep scene - and with it a new lease on life. After 12"s on Big Apple, they began [[DMZ Records|DMZ]] label, which has released eleven 12"s to date. They also began their night DMZ, held every two months in Brixton, a part of London steeped in [[reggae]] history. DMZ has showcased new dubstep talent such as Skream, Kode 9, Benga, Pinch, DJ Youngsta, Hijak, JoeNice and [[Vex'd]]. The evening that queues at DMZ exceeded the capacity of the venue, prompting a move to a larger capacity venue upstairs has been called a pivotal point in the popularity of dubstep by [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] magazine {{fact|date=April 2007}}

Dubstep nights possessing [[sound systems]] of comparable power to DMZ include Subloaded, [[Bristol]]'s dubstep night promoted by DJ Pinch and the Context crew, along with the monthly SubDub/Exodus night at the [[Leeds West Indian Centre]] on the [[Iration Steppas]] Sound System.  

[[2006 in music|2006]] saw interest grow in the sound. Building on the success of [[Skream]]'s [[2005 in music|2005]] grimey anthem 'Midnight Request Line,' the hype around the DMZ night and support from online forums and bloggers, the scene gained prominence after [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] gathered the cream of the scene together for one show, entitled 'Dubstep Warz', (later releasing the [[compilation album]] '[[Warrior Dubz]]'). The effect was to create a massive new audience for the scene, both in the UK and worldwide, after years of underground hard graft.  A successful year for the genre culminated in [[Burial (musician)|Burial]]'s self-titled album appearing in many critics' "Best of..." lists for the year, notably [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire Magazine]]'s Best Album of 2006. Ammunition also released the first retrospective compilation of the 2000-2004 era of dubstep called "The Roots of Dubstep," co-compiled by Ammunition and Blackdown on the [[Tempa]] Label.

In [[2006 in Music|2006]] dubstep producers are increasingly absorbing [[dub]] [[reggae]] sonic aesthetics - sub bass, reverb and delay - to forge a distinct path away from associate genres like drum & bass, house and breaks. Using different rhythmic patterns like the 2-step and halfstep beat patterns (yet deployed in the same tempo range) dubstep can create senses of differing momentum within the same DJ set. At best, [[dub]] [[reggae]] sonic aesthetics also allow a broad range of new musical influences to be introduced.

[[Digital Mystikz]], Random Trio and [[Kode 9]] were all featured on the soundtrack for the [[2006 in Music|2006]] sci-fi film [[Children of Men]].

Experimental techno artists and [[DJ]]s are now assimilating dubstep into their sets. Renowned wonky [[techno]] [[producer]] [[Neil Landstrumm]] is currently touring his 'Ravestep' set, and [[minimal techno]] DJ/producer [[Ricardo Villalobos]] has produced a (typically long and slowly evolving) remix of [[Shackleton (musician)|Shackleton]]'s ''Blood on my hands''.

Today Dubstep has evolved from its south London origins and has taken root in Canada, USA, Japan, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France, Spain, Scotland, New Zealand and Australia.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}
