[[Rugby league]] is a popular team sport played in [[England]]. Its popularity is strongest in a swathe of northern England from [[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]] across the [[Pennines]] to [[Yorkshire]], these areas being those in which the game originated. The sport is also popular in [[Cumbria]] where the amateur game is particularly powerful. The game is played outside of these traditional areas but in far lower numbers. However, there has been considerable growth in the game on English soil, which can be seen in television viewing figures, attendance at Super League games [http://www.rfl.uk.com/HOME/news_item.php?id=6354] and participants nationwide as compared with previous years.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Within its heartlands, rugby league is often referred to as simply "rugby" though in the rest of England this would mean rugby union. It is on occasion called "football" though even in the North of England this would normally refer to [[Association football]]. For this reason, it is common among English rugby league fans to use the term "soccer" when talking about [[Association football]]. 

The sport receives funding from [[Sport England]] as an 'English priority' sport.[http://www.sportengland.org/rugbyleague.pdf]

==History==
{{Main|History of rugby league}}

[[rugby football|Rugby]] has long been popular in the North of England, and by the 1880s the region's clubs had come to dominate. The game was largely popular amongst [[working class]] people, unlike the clubs in Southern England whose players belonged to the [[middle class|middle]] or [[upper class]]. Rugby competition at the time did not allow paying players any salary; the working-class players felt they could not afford time off to train and play, nor could they afford to miss work through injury sustained whilst playing. The principle of [[amateurism]], and issues of class ensured that the [[Rugby Football Union]] would not countenance professional rugby.

In 1895 representatives of the northern clubs met to form the ''"Northern Rugby Football Union" (NRFU)''. It is often, mistakenly, thought that this new body allowed professionalism from the start, though in fact the NRFU was initially vehemently anti-professional, allowing only payments for time missed from other employment. A thriving amateur scene also soon developed, as local amateur clubs wished to maintain links with their "Northern Union" neighbours. 

On the 18th January 1908, the first ever Great Britain test match took place at Headingley, versus New Zealand.

The British government discouraged all professional sports during the First World War, and the major competitions were abandoned. The NRFU became the [[Rugby Football League]] in 1922.

A tradition was started in 1929 when Wigan beat Dewsbury 13-2 at the first [[Rugby League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]] to be held at Wemberley.

During the Second World War, the British government took a more benign view of professional sports, viewing them as a vital aid to public morale. Although normal leagues were suspended, a War Emergency League was established, with clubs playing separate Yorkshire and Lancashire sections to reduce the need for travel.

Several attempts were made to expand the game outside the heartlands, a Southern Amateur Rugby League being formed in 1949, however only [[Cumberland]] proved receptive. Nonetheless the game survived, and continued to maintain popularity in its home regions. The introduction of regular internationals as other countries took up the sport provided a fillip.

Rugby league experienced a surge in interest following the end of World War II. Large crowds came to be the norm for a period of around 20 years. The total crowds for the British season hit a record in 1949-50, when over 69.8 million paying customers attended all matches. 
The 1954 Challenge Cup Final Replay between Halifax and Warrington, held at [[Odsal Stadium]] drew 102,575 paying spectators with an estimated 20,000 others getting in free after a section of fencing collapsed. 

The boom had begun to subside by the early sixties, David Attenborough, then controller of BBC2, made the decision to screen games from a new competition the [[BBC2 Floodlit Trophy]]. It proved a success, and rugby league has featured on television ever since.

Britain last won the Ashes was in 1970 with a 2-1 series win in Australia after winning the final two test matches.

The foundation of the [[Student Rugby League|Universities and Colleges Rugby League]] in 1969 and the [[British Amateur Rugby League Association]] in 1973 responded to the need to develop the game below professional level. The [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmparty/060512/memi378.htm All-Party Parliamentary Rugby League Group] was formed in 1987 to support the sport of rugby league and tackle the key issues facing the game in Parliament. [[Ian McCartney]] MP was the  first chairman and [[David Hinchliffe]] MP the secretary. 

In the mid eighties [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] began an era of domination of English rugby league that would end only with the formation of Super League.

The traditional [[Rugby League War of Roses|Origin series]] between Yorkshire and Lancashire was abandoned in 1989.

The Combined Services Rugby League (CSRL) was formed in 1994 after the official recognition of rugby league by the Armed Services. The rival code [[rugby union]] went professional in 1995 and as a result, other restrictions on rugby league were relaxed by the [[Rugby Football Union]].

In [[1995]], the fallout from the [[Super League war]] hit Britain, and  the game underwent massive re-organisation. A new elite league, [[Super League (Europe)]] was formed, and the sport switched from a winter to a summer season. Super League has largely been a success for the game as a whole as television ratings, top tier game crowd attendances and participation numbers all growing year upon year since 2001; few would argue that the health of the game is not far better than it was during the mid 1990s.

The [[Rugby League Conference]] was founded in 1998 with the aim of providing regular fixtures for new clubs based outside the 'heartland' of rugby league.

The Origin Series was revived in 2001 before being abandoned in 2003.

==Governing bodies==
There is no governing body for the sport in England - that role is filled by the [[Rugby Football League]], whose remit covers the [[United Kingdom]] as a whole. With the advent of [[Wales Rugby League]], [[Scotland Rugby League]] and [[Rugby League Ireland]], the RFL are increasingly becoming an English organisation. The RFL are affiliated to the [[Rugby League International Federation]] and the [[Rugby League European Federation]].

Most amateur rugby league is run by the [[British Amateur Rugby League Association]] (BARLA), though they are not responsible for the [[Rugby League Conference]], thus the vast majority of BARLA team are concentrated in the sport's north of England heartlands.

The [http://www.army.mod.uk/sportandadventure/clubs/arl/cs_rl/index.htm Combined Services Rugby League] (CSRL) is the co-ordinating group for the Army Rugby League, Royal Navy Rugby League and the Royal Air Force Rugby League.

The Community Board is made up of representatives of the RFL, BARLA, Combined Services, English Schools Rugby League and [[Student Rugby League]].

The Women's Rugby League Association (WRLA) is the governing body of female rugby league in the [[United Kingdom]]; it currently falls under the [[Rugby Football League]] association which oversees its running and management. It was originally established in [[1985]] and was recognized by the RFL in its first year.

==Competitions==

{{Main|British rugby league system}}

[[Super League (Europe)]] is the top league for the game in England. It is the only full-time professional rugby league competition operating in the northern hemisphere. The French team, Paris St. Germain competed in the first Super League but folded in 1999. The French presence was re-established in 2006 when [[Les Catalans]] were admitted to Super League. The winner of the league is awarded the [[League Leader's Shield]] whilst the overall winner of Super League is determined by play-offs and a grand final.

The winner of the Super League plays the winner of the Australian [[National Rugby League|NRL]] competition in the [[World Club Challenge]].

Below Super League, there are [[Rugby League National Leagues|National Leagues]] one and two. There is promotion between National League one and two as well as between National league one and Super League. The [[National League Cup]] is a competition with groups and a knock-out phase for clubs in the National Leagues. In 2006 [[Wales|Welsh]] team [[Celtic Crusaders]] joined National League two.

The [[Rugby League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]] remains as a knockout competition, though entry has now been expanded to make it a pan-European tournament bringing in teams from France and Russia. Amateur teams also have the chance to partcipate in the Challenge Cup and have been victorious over several National League sides.

BARLA administer different amateur competitions which run throughout the winter in the heartlands. The leading competition is the [[National Conference League]] which consists of three divisions (Premier Division, Division One and Division Two) of up to 14 teams each. The National Conference takes teams from all over England but since the advent of the Rugby League Conference has been contested only by heartlands teams. Other major amateur leagues include the [[North West Counties|North West Counties League]], [[CMS Yorkshire league|CMS Yorkshire League]], [[Pennine League]], [[Cumberland League]], [[Barrow & District League]] and the [[Hull & District League]]. Teams from these regional leagues can apply for election to the National Conference League if they meet minimum criteria.

The [[Rugby League Conference]] (played in summer) has many grass roots teams but is considered 'open' rather than amateur though most teams do not pay their players. Most of the teams are based outside the game's heartlands. The [[London League (rugby league)|London League]] and [[Midlands RL Merit League|Midlands Merit League]] act as feeders for the Conference.

==Defunct competitions==

At various times English clubs have either competed in a national [[Rugby League Championship|Championship]] with a [[Rugby League Championship Second Division|Second Division]] and sometimes a [[Rugby League Championship Second Division|Third Division]] as well or had separate [[Rugby league county leagues|county leagues]] for Yorkshire and Lancashire.

There were also [[Rugby league county cups|county cups]] for Yorkshire and Lancashire between 1905 and 1993. The [[Regal Trophy]] and [[BBC2 Floodlit Trophy]] were two other knock-out tournaments. A [[Trans-Pennine Cup]] was played for a short-time but it was replaced by the [[National League Cup]].

The [[Rugby League Charity Shield (Great Britain)|Rugby League Charity Shield]] was a one-off match at the beginning of each season between 1985 and 1995. It was contested by the Champions and the holders of the Challenge Cup.

The rugby union county championship was continued as a rugby league county championship after the 1895 great schism. Teams representing Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumberland / Cumbria and sometimes Cheshire and Northumberland & Durham took part in the championship. This continued as the [[Rugby League War of Roses]] played between Yorkshire and Lancashire.

==Derbies==

The following games are considered [[Local derby|derbies]]. There has been some debate as to whether St Helens versus Wigan Warriors or Bradford Bulls versus Leeds Rhinos is the biggest derby in English rugby league.

*[[River Calder|Calder]] derbies - between [[Castleford Tigers]], [[Featherstone Rovers]], and [[Wakefield Trinity]]
*[[Cheshire]] derby - [[Widnes Vikings]] v [[Warrington Wolves]]
*[[Heavy Woollen District|Heavy Woollen]] derby - [[Batley Bulldogs]] v [[Dewsbury Rams]]
*[[Humberside]] or [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] derby - [[Hull FC]] v [[Hull KR]]
*Manchester derby - [[Salford City Reds|Salford]] v [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]] 
*North West derby - [[St Helens RFC|St Helens]] v [[Wigan Warriors]]
*[[South Yorkshire]] derby - [[Sheffield Eagles]] v [[Doncaster Lakers]]
*West [[Cumbria]] derbies - [[Barrow Raiders]], [[Whitehaven RLFC|Whitehaven]] and [[Workington Town]]
*[[West Yorkshire]] derby - [[Bradford Bulls]] v [[Leeds Rhinos]]
*[[Oldham Roughyeds]] v [[Rochdale Hornets]]

==Student Rugby League==
:''See also'' [[Student Rugby League]]

Though the game remains close to its [[working-class]] origins, changes in social demographics and attitudes have allowed many working class people to attend university where they have continued their association with the game. 

The Student Rugby League was founded in 1967 when a team was created at Leeds University by Andrew Cudbertson, Jack Abernathy and [[Cec Thompson]], other teams soon joined in areas of the United Kingdom which lay outside of the games traditional heartlands.

The first university game was between Leeds and Liverpool in 1968. A year later the Universities and Colleges Rugby League was formed after student pioneers fought hard to get the sport recognised in higher education. The first Oxford versus Cambridge University match took place in 1981. The varsity match has '[[University Sporting Blue|discretionary full blue]]' status. The game is now played in over 70 Universities. 

In 2006 the Student Rugby League had over 70 member clubs playing in 9 leagues, club locations ranging from Napier in Scotland to Exeter in the south of England.

Due to the efforts of former [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative party]] chairman [[Edward du Cann|Sir Edward du Cann]], there is now a scholarship programme for [[Oxford University]] [http://www.ourlfc.org/scholarship].

Rugby league in universities has been an important vehicle for expansion of the game as players from outside the heartlands often first began to play at university level. Many continue to play after leaving university and this has led to the creation of teams in non-traditional raeas such as [[London Skolars]].

==Rugby league nines==

The [[Middlesex 9s]] and the [[York International 9s]] are two of the best known [[rugby league nines]] tournaments in England.

==Popularity==

Rugby league is one of a number of sports vying for (distant) second place to Association football in the nation's affection. The [[MORI]] Sports Tracker  [http://www.mori.com/sport/tracker.shtml ] consistently reports that rugby league interests around 15% of [[United Kingdom|British]] adults. It was the fourth most popular team sport in the February 2005 list behind football, cricket and rugby union. 

Rugby league is extremely popular in its "heartland" and, in those areas, interest in the sport rivals that of [[soccer]]. Many large towns with rugby league traditions do not have football teams as a result of the monopoly on local interest: for example, St Helens, Whitehaven, Warrington, Keighley, Castleford, Dewsbury, Batley and, until recently, Wakefield. It is striking how interest in rugby league can be very widespread in such towns whilst towns just a few miles away might have hardly any fans of the sport.

The regions in which rugby league is played most are West [[Cumbria]], where the amateur version has a high participation rate; south [[Lancashire]] outside the cities of [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]]; [[West Yorkshire]] and the city of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. The sport is present in [[South Yorkshire]] and in [[York]], but on a much smaller scale; it has little presence in the [[North East England|North East]] or the largely rural county of [[North Yorkshire]]. Many of the professional and semi-professional teams are connected by the [[M62 motorway]] and so the term 'M62 corridor' is sometimes used, often in a derogatory manner, to refer to the area where rugby league is popular.

Rugby league is considered by most English people to be a regional sport, which perhaps prevents rugby league making further inroads in to the English psyche in the South, and those cities which already thrive on soccer, and to a lesser extent, cricket and rugby union.  Neither is it played in as great numbers elsewhere in England, although semi-professional and amateur clubs do exist in the lower national leagues and conference leagues and there is significant schools participation in [[London]].

50% of viewers who watch rugby league on Sky Sports live in the South of England. Over 40% of active rugby league supporters are female. [http://www.rfl.uk.com/ABOUT/facts.php] At the beginning of the [[2006]] season there were between thirty and forty female only rugby league clubs running in [[England]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_league/get_involved/4223236.stm] not including clubs that have teams of both sexes. The majority of these clubs are located in [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]].

Perhaps because of its regional character, rugby league as a whole has a lower participation rate compared to the other three major sports in England. Rugby league has for much of its history been banned in the armed forces and in many schools and universities, further stifling growth. These barriers have largely been dismantled in the past ten years due to professionalisation of the rival code of [[rugby union]].

In [[2004]] the [[Rugby Football League]] reported 62,463 registered players (this is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-wide figure). The 2006 Super League generated the highest weekly average attendance in the 11-year history of the competition. The average weekly attendance for the regular season stood at 9,026, generated by an aggregate attendance of 1,516,342 supporters. This is an increase on the 2005 season average of 8,887.[http://www.rfl.uk.com/HOME/news_item.php?id=6354]. The attendances are not evenly spread between clubs within Super League; whilst the best supported team, [[Leeds Rhinos]] with average gates of 15,683, a couple of clubs failed to attract averages of above 5,000. Crowds at matches below the top flight can exceed 3,500, however most of the clubs in this division have attendances lower than this.

Although attendances outside Super League can be quite low, many of the teams play in small towns and the attendance figures represent a large percentage of the local population.[http://jotbin.com/articles/2006/01/11/populationattendances]

===Current trends===
The success of [[Super League (Europe)|Super League]] in England and the return of competitive international matches with [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] have seen growth for the sport. There is heavy expansion in the south with conference competitions, and Harlequins RL (formerly [[London Broncos]]) still enjoying moderate success in the Super League.

The ending of [[Amateur sports#Rugby League and Union|discrimination against rugby league]] resulting from professionalism in rugby union led to an increase in numbers in the amateur game, with many rugby union amateurs keen to try out the other code. In 2004 the Rugby Football League was able to report a 94% increase in registered players in just two years, whilst attendance figures for [[Super League (Europe)|Super League]] matches rose 8% from the 2003 season.

The annual Powergen Schools Cup competition from 2003 onwards has increased the number of school teams from 300 to 1,500 and the participation levels to 25,000 from 6,000. Though these figures include participants from Wales.

Whilst [[rugby union]] was officially an amateur sport, many rugby union players came to play rugby league. In recent years this trend has reversed and some rugby league players have crossed codes to play union. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/5343720.stm]

Expansion by the governing body, the [[Rugby Football League]] sees continual growth in the south of England, notably the [[London]] area, which now boasts two professional clubs ([[Harlequins Rugby League]], formerly the [[London Broncos]], and [[London Skolars]]). One of the prime vehicles for expansion has been the [[Rugby League Conference]], a set of competitions for clubs in those development areas.

{{Main|Great Britain national rugby league team}}

On the 5th April 1904, England played its first game losing 9-3 to 'Other Nationalities' at a 12-a-side match at Wigan.

England took part in the [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] ([[1975 Rugby League World Cup|1975]], ([[1977 Rugby League World Cup|1977]], [[1995 Rugby League World Cup|1995]], [[2000 Rugby League World Cup|2000]]) and the [[Rugby League World Sevens|World Sevens]] (2002, 2003). 
The nation of England was represented by the Great Britain side at the [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|1954]], [[1957 Rugby League World Cup|1957]], [[1960 Rugby League World Cup|1960]],
