'''Kazi Nazrul Islam''' ({{lang-bn|কাজী নজরুল ইসলাম}} ''Kazi Nozrul Islam'') ([[25 May]], [[1899]]&ndash;[[29 August]], [[1976]]) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Bengali poetry|poet]], [[Music of Bengal|musician]], [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary]], and [[philosopher]] who pioneered poetic works espousing intense spiritual rebellion against [[orthodoxy]] and oppression. His poetry and nationalist activism earned him the popular title of ''Bidrohi Kobi'' (Rebel Poet). Accomplishing a [[Complete Works of Kazi Nazrul Islam|large body of acclaimed works]] through his life, Nazrul is officially recognised as the [[national poet]] of [[Bangladesh]] and commemorated in [[India]]. 

Born into a poor [[Muslim]] family, Nazrul received religious education and worked as a [[muezzin]] at a local [[mosque]]. He learned of poetry, drama, and literature while working with theatrical groups. After serving in the [[British Indian Army]], Nazrul established himself as a journalist in [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta). He assailed the [[British Raj]] in India and preached revolution through his poetic works, such as "Bidrohi" ("The Rebel") and "Bhangar Gaan" ("The Song of Destruction"), as well as his publication "Dhumketu" ("The Comet"). His impassioned activism in the [[Indian independence movement]] often led to his imprisonment by British authorities. While in prison, Nazrul wrote the "Rajbandir Jabanbandi" ("Deposition of a Political Prisoner"). Exploring the life and conditions of the downtrodden masses of India, Nazrul worked for their emancipation.  

Nazrul's writings explore themes such as love, freedom, and revolution; he opposed all bigotry, including religious and gender.  Throughout his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays but is best-known for his poems, in which he pioneered new forms such as Bengali [[ghazal]]s. Nazrul wrote and composed music for his nearly 4,000 songs (including gramophone records) <ref>{{cite book |last=Hossain |first=Quazi Motahar |authorlink= Qazi Motahar Hossain |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.55 |chapter=Nazrul Islam, the Singer and Writer of Songs}}</ref>, collectively known as [[Complete Works of Kazi Nazrul Islam|Nazrul geeti]] (Nazrul songs), which are widely popular today. At the age of 43 (in 1942) he began suffering from an unknown disease, losing his voice and memory. What was later diagnosed as [[Pick's Disease]], caused Nazrul's health to decline steadily and forced him to live in isolation for many years. Invited by the [[Government of Bangladesh]], Nazrul and his family moved to [[Dhaka]] in 1972, where he died four years later.

==Early life==
[[Image:NazrulArmy.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Nazrul in the Army]]
Kazi Nazrul Islam was born in the village of [[Churulia]] in the [[Burdwan District]] of [[Bengal]] (now located in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]]).<ref name=instibio>{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> He was born in a [[Muslim]] family who is second of three sons and a daughter, Nazrul's father was the [[imam]] and caretaker of the local mosque and mausoleum. Nazrul's mother was Zaheda Khatun. Nazrul had two brothers, Kazi Shahebjan and Kazi Ali Hussain, and a sister, Umme Kulsum. Nicknamed ''Dukhu Mia'' (Sad Man), Nazrul began attending the ''maktab'' &mdash; the local religious school run by the mosque &mdash; where he studied the [[Qur'an]] and other scriptures, Islamic philosophy and theology. His family was devastated with the death of his father in 1908. At the young age of ten, Nazrul began working in his father's place as a caretaker to support his family, as well as assisting teachers in school. He later became the [[muezzin]] at the mosque, leading the community prayers.<ref name="Banglapedia">{{cite web

Attracted to folk theatre, Nazrul joined a ''leto'' (travelling theatrical group) run by his uncle Bazle Karim. Working and travelling with them, learning [[acting]], as well as writing songs and poems for the plays and musicals.<ref name=instibio/> Through his work and experiences, Nazrul began learning Bengali and [[Sanskrit literature]], as well as Hindu scriptures such as the [[Puranas]]. The young poet composed a number of folk plays for his group, which included "Chasar San" ("The story of a Farmer"), "Shakunibadh" ("The Killing of a Vulture"), "Raja Yudhisthirer San" ("The story of King ''Yudhisthir''"), "Data Karna" ("Philanthropic ''Karna''"), "Akbar Badshah" ("Emperor ''Akbar''"), "Kavi Kalidas" ("Poet ''Kalidas''"), "Vidyabhutum" ("The Learned Owl"), "Rajputrer San" ("The story of a Prince"), "Buda Saliker Ghade Ron" ("Battered Old Bird") and "Meghnad Badh" ("The Killing of ''Meghnad''").<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

In 1910, Nazrul left the troupe and enrolled at the Raniganj Searsole Raj School, and later transferred to the Mathrun High English School, studying under the headmaster and poet [[Kumudranjan Mallik]]. Unable to continue paying his school fees, Nazrul left the school and joined a group of “kaviyals”. Later he took jobs as a cook at the house of a [[Christian]] railway guard and at a bakery and tea stall in the town of Asansol. In 1914, Nazrul joined the Darirampur School (now Nazrul University) in [[Trishal]], [[Mymensingh District]]. Amongst other subjects, Nazrul studied Bengali, Sanskrit, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian literature]] and [[Hindustani classical music|classical music]] under teachers who were impressed by his dedication and skill.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

Studying up to Class X, Nazrul did not appear for the [[matriculation]] pre-test examination, enlisting instead in the Indian Army in 1917 at the age of eighteen. He joined the British army mainly for two reasons: first, his youthful romantic inclination to respond to the unknown and, secondly, the call of politics<ref>{{cite book |last=Bose|first=Buddhadeva |authorlink=Buddhadeb Bosu |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.80 |chapter=Modern Bengali Poetry and Nazrul Islam}}</ref>. 
Attached to the 49th [[Bengal Regiment]], he was posted to the [[cantonment]] in [[Karachi]], where he wrote his first prose and poetry. Although he never saw active fighting, he rose in rank from corporal to ''havildar'', and served as [[quartermaster]] for his [[battalion]].<ref name="Banglapedia"/>
During this period, Nazrul read extensively, and was deeply influenced by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]], as well as the Persian poets [[Hafez (poet)|Hafez]], [[Rumi]] and [[Omar Khayyam]]. He learnt Persian poetry from the regiment's [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[moulvi]], practiced music and pursued his literary interests. His first prose work, "Baunduler Atmakahini" ("Life of a Vagabond") was published in May, 1919. His poem "Mukti" ("Freedom") was published by the "Bangla Mussalman Sahitya Patrika" ("Bengali Muslim Literary Journal") in July 1919.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

==Rebel poet==
[[Image:Nazrul1.gif|thumb|right|200px|Young Nazrul]]
Nazrul left the army in 1920 and settled in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], which was then the ''Cultural capital of India'' (it had ceased to be the political capital in 1911).<ref name ="Hall">{{cite book |last=Hall |first=P |authorlink= Peter Hall (urbanist) |title=Cities of Tomorrow |year=2002 |publisher= Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0631232524 |pages = pp.198-206}}</ref> He joined the staff of the “Bangiya Mussalman Sahitya Samiti” ("Bengali Muslim Literary Society") and roomed at 32 [[College Street (Kolkata)|College Street]] with colleagues. He published his first novel "Bandhan-hara" ("Freedom from bondage") in 1920, which he kept working on over the next seven years.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>  His first collection of poems included "Bodhan", "Shat-il-Arab", "Kheya-parer Tarani" and "Badal Prater Sharab" and received critical acclaim.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

Working at the literary society, Nazrul grew close to other young Muslim writers including Mohammad Mozammel Haq, Afzalul Haq, Kazi Abdul Wadud and [[Muhammad Shahidullah]]. He was a regular at clubs for Calcutta's writers, poets and intellectuals like the Gajendar Adda and the Bharatiya Adda. In October 1921, Nazrul went to [[Santiniketan]] with Muhammad Shahidullah and met Rabindranath Tagore. Despite many differences, Nazrul looked to Tagore as a mentor and the two remained in close association.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> In 1921, Nazrul was engaged to be married to Nargis, the niece of a well-known Muslim publisher Ali Akbar Khan, in Daulatpur, [[Comilla District|Comilla]]. But on [[June 18]], [[1921]]—the day of the wedding—upon public insistence by Ali Akbar Khan that the term "''Nazrul must reside in Daulatpur after marriage''" be included in the marriage contract, Nazrul walked away from the ceremony.

Nazrul reached the peak of fame with the publication of "Bidrohi" in 1922, which remains his most famous work, winning admiration of India's literary classes by his description of the rebel whose impact is fierce and ruthless even as its spirit is deep:.<ref>{{cite book |last=Amin|first=Sonia |title=The World of Muslim Women in Colonial Bengal, 1876-1939 |year=1996 |publisher= |isbn=9004106421 |pages=106}}</ref>

Published in the "Bijli" magazine, the rebellious language and theme was popularly received, coinciding with the [[Non-Cooperation Movement|Non-cooperation movement]] — the first, mass nationalist campaign of [[civil disobedience]] against British rule.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

Nazrul explores a synthesis of different forces in a rebel, destroyer and preserver, expressing rage as well as beauty and sensitivity. Nazrul followed up by writing "Pralayollas" ("Destructive Euphoria"), and his first anthology of poems, the "Agniveena" ("Lyre of Fire") in 1922, which enjoyed astounding and far-reaching success. He also published his first volume of short stories, the "Byather Dan" ("Gift of Sorrow") and "Yugbani", an anthology of essays.

Nazrul started a bi-weekly magazine, publishing the first "Dhumketu" on [[August 12]], [[1922]]. Earning the moniker of the "rebel poet”, Nazrul also aroused the suspicion of British authorities.<ref name=instibio/> A political poem published in "Dhumketu" in September 1922 led to a police raid on the magazine's office. Arrested, Nazrul entered a lengthy plea before the judge in the court. 

<blockquote>I have been accused of sedition. That is why I am now confined in the prison. On the one side is the crown, on the other the flames of the comet. One is the king, sceptre in hand; the other Truth worth the mace of justice. To plead for me, the king of all kings, the judge of all judges, the eternal truth the living God... His laws emerged out of the realization of a universal truth about mankind. They are for and by a sovereign God. The king is supported by an infinitesimal creature; I by its eternal and indivisible Creator. I am a poet; I have been sent by God to express the unexpressed, to portray the unportrayed. It is God who is heard through the voice of the poet... My voice is but a medium for Truth, the message of God... I am the instrument of that eternal self-evident truth, an instrument that voices forth the message of the ever-true. I am an instrument of God.

On [[April 14]], [[1923]] he was transferred from the jail in [[Alipore]] to [[Hugli-Chuchura|Hooghly]] in Kolkata, he began a 40-day fast to protest mistreatment by the British jail superintendent. Nazrul broke his fast more than a month later and was eventually released from prison in December 1923. Nazrul composed a large number of poems and songs during the period of imprisonment and many his works were banned in the 1920s by the British authorities.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

Kazi Nazrul Islam became a critic of the [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat struggle]], condemning it as hollow, religious fundamentalism.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> Nazrul's rebellious expression extended to rigid orthodoxy in the name of religion and politics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rushd |first=Abu |authorlink=Abu Rushd |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.100 |chapter=Nazrul Islam's 'The Rebel'}}</ref> Nazrul also criticised the [[Indian National Congress]] for not embracing outright political independence from the [[British Empire]]. He became active in encouraging people to agitate against British rule, and joined the Bengal state unit of the Congress party.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> Nazrul also helped organise the [[Sramik Praja Swaraj Dal]], a political party committed to national independence and the service of the peasant masses. On [[December 16]], [[1925]] Nazrul started publishing the weekly "Langal”, with himself as chief editor.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> The "Langal" was the mouthpiece of the Sramik Praja Swaraj Dal.

During his visit to [[Comilla]] in 1921, Nazrul met a young Hindu woman, Pramila Devi, with whom he fell in love and they married on [[April 25]], [[1924]]. Pramila belonged to the [[Brahmo Samaj]], which criticised her marriage to a Muslim. Nazrul in turn was condemned by Muslim religious leaders and continued to face criticism for his personal life and professional works, which attacked social and religious dogma and intolerance. Despite controversy, Nazrul's popularity and reputation as the "rebel poet" rose significantly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=Serajul Islam|authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.141 |chapter=The Blazing Comet}} </ref><ref name="Banglapedia">{{cite web

With his wife and young son Bulbul, Nazrul settled in [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanagar]] in 1926. His work began to transform as he wrote poetry and songs that articulated the aspirations of the downtrodden classes, a sphere of his work known as "mass music."<ref>{{cite book |last=Islam|first=Rafiqul|authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.113 |chapter=Nazrul}}</ref> Nazrul assailed the socio-economic norms and political system that had brought upon misery.

The first record of Islamic songs by Nazrul Islam was a commercial success and many gramophone companies showed interest in producing these. A significant impact of Nazrul's "[[Islamisation]]" of Bengali music was that it drew an audience amongst conservative Muslims, traditionally averse to music. Nazrul also composed a number of notable ''[[Shamasangeet]]'', ''[[Bhajan]]'' and ''[[Kirtan]]'', combining Hindu devotional music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Islam|first=Rafiqul|authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.115 |chapter=Nazrul}}</ref> Arousing controversy and passions in his readers, Nazrul's ideas attained great popularity across India. In 1928, Nazrul began working as a lyricist, composer and music director for [[His Master's Voice]] Gramophone Company. The songs written and music composed by him were broadcast on radio stations across the country. He was also enlisted/attached with the Indian Broadcasting Company <ref>Haque, Asadul. 1999.

<br>

Nazrul professed faith in the belief in the equality of women &mdash; a view his contemporaries considered revolutionary.<ref>{{cite book |last=Amin|first=Sonia |title=The World of Muslim Women in Colonial Bengal, 1876-1939 |year=1996 |publisher= |isbn=9004106421 |pages=106}}</ref> From his poet ''Nari'' (Woman):  

<blockquote>
I don't see any difference<br>
Between a man and woman<br>
Whatever great or benevolent achievements <br/>
That are in this world <br/>
Half of that was by woman, <br/>
The other half by man. (Translated by Sajed Kamal<ref name="SK">The Daily Star. May 25, 2003</ref>)</blockquote>

His poetry retains long-standing notions of men and women in binary opposition to one another and does not affirm gender similarities and flexibility in the social structure:  

<blockquote>Man has brought the burning, scorching heat of the sunny day; <br/>
Woman has brought peaceful night, soothing breeze and cloud.<br/>
Man comes with desert-thirst; woman provides the drink of honey.<br/>
Man ploughs the fertile land; woman sows crops in it turning it green. <br/>
Man ploughs, woman waters; that earth and water mixed together, brings about a harvest of golden paddy.<ref name="SK" /></blockquote>
However, Nazrul's poems strongly emphasise the confluence of the roles of both sexes and their equal importance to life. He stunned society with his poem "Barangana" ("Prostitute"), in which he addresses a prostitute as "mother".<ref>{{cite book |last=Huda|first=Mohammad Nurul|authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.314 |chapter=Nazrul's Personlore}}</ref>

Nazrul was an advocate of the emancipation of women; both traditional and non-traditional women were portrayed by him with utmost sincerity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Huda|first=Mohammad Nurul|authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.314 |chapter=Nazrul's Personlore}}</ref>

Nazrul's mother died in 1928, and his second son Bulbul died of [[smallpox]] the following year. His first son, Krishna Mohammad had died prematurely. His wife gave birth to two more sons &mdash; Savyasachi in 1928 and Aniruddha in 1931 &mdash; but Nazrul remained shaken and aggrieved for a long time. His works changed significantly from rebellious expositions of society to deeper examination of religious themes. His works in these years led Islamic devotional songs into the mainstream of [[Bengali music|Bengali folk music]], exploring the Islamic practices of ''[[namaz]]'' (prayer), ''[[sawm|roza]]'' (fasting), ''[[hajj]]'' (pilgrimage) and ''[[zakat]]'' (charity). This was regarded by his contemporaries as a significant achievement as Bengali Muslims had been strongly averse to devotional music.<ref>Kamrunnessa Azad. 2001. Dharmiya Chetonay Nazrul. Nazrul Institute, Dhaka. 1999. pp. 173-174</ref> Nazrul's creativity diversified as he explored Hindu devotional music by composing ''Shama Sangeet'', ''[[bhajan]]s'' and ''[[kirtan]]s'', often merging Islamic and Hindu values. Nazrul's poetry and songs explored the philosophy of Islam and Hinduism <ref>Kamrunnessa Azad. 2001. Dharmiya Chetonay Nazrul. Nazrul Institute, Dhaka. 1999. pp. 19-20</ref>.

<blockquote>Let people of all countries and all times come together. At one great union of humanity. Let them listen to the flute music of one great unity. Should a single person be hurt, all hearts should feel it equally. If one person is insulted; it is a shame to all mankind, an insult to all! Today is the grand uprising of the agony of universal man.<ref>Chakravarthy, p. 72.</ref></blockquote>

Nazrul's poetry imbibed the passion and creativity of [[Shakti]], which is identified as the [[Brahman]], the personification of primordial energy. He wrote and composed many ''bhajans'', ''shyamasangeet'', ''agamanis'' and ''kirtans''. He also composed large number of songs on invocation to Lord [[Shiva]], Goddesses [[Lakshmi]] and [[Saraswati]] and on the theme of love of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]].<ref name="MOF2"/> 

Nazrul assailed fanaticism in religion, denouncing it as evil and inherently irreligious. He devoted many works to expound upon the principle of human equality, exploring the ''[[Qur'an]]'' and the life of Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]]. Nazrul has been compared to [[William Butler Yeats]] for being the first Muslim poet to create imagery and symbolism of Muslim historical figures such as Qasim, [[Ali]], [[Umar]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Kamal Pasha]], Anwar Pasha and the prophet [[Muhammad]].<ref name="sedition"/> His vigorous assault on extremism and mistreatment of women provoked condemnation from fundamentalist Muslims, many of whom denounced him as a ''[[kafir|kaffir]]'' (heretic).<ref>p 184, [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC&pg=PA184&dq=nazrul+shakta&sig=eYGtnYREbix3KeA8SZLokmSDDAI Google books preview] from 'Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal' by June McDaniel, ISBN 0195167902</ref>

In 1920, Nazrul expressed his vision of religious harmony in an editorial in ''Yuga Bani'', 
<blockquote>“Come brother [[Hindu]]! Come [[Muslim|Musalman]]! Come [[Buddhist]]! Come [[Christian]]! Let us transcend all barriers, let us foresake forever all smallness, all lies, all selfishness and let us call brothers as brothers. We shall quarrel no more”.<ref>{{cite book |last=Moniruzzaman |first=Mohammad |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]]|others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.149 |chapter=Interaction of Cultures and Kazi Nazrul Islam}}</ref></blockquote>

In another article entitled ''Hindu Mussalman'' published in ''Ganabani'' on [[September 2]], [[192]] he wrote - 

<blockquote>‘’I can tolerate Hinduism and Muslims but I cannot tolerate the Tikism (Tiki is a tuft of never cut hair kept on the head by certain Hindus to maitain personal Holiness) and beardism. Tiki is not Hinduism. It may be the sign of the pundit. Similarly beards is not Islam, it may be the sign of the pundit. Similarly beard is not Islam, it may be the sign of the [[Mullah|mollah]]. All the hair-pulling have originated from those two tufts of hair. Todays fighting is alos between the Pundit and the Mollah: It is not between the Hindus and the Muslims. No prophet has said, ‘’I have come for Hindus I have come for Muslims I have come for Christians.” They have said, “I have come for the humanity for everyone, like light’’. But the devotees of Krishna says, “Krishna is for Hindus”. The followers of Muhammad (Sm) says, “Muhammad (Sm) is for the Muslims”. The Disciple of Christ is for Christian”. Krishna-Muhammad-Christ have become national property. This property is the root of all trouble. Men do not quarrel for light but they quarrel over cattles.”<ref>{{cite book |last=Moniruzzaman |first=Mohammad |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.153-54 |chapter=Interaction of Cultures and Kazi Nazrul Islam}}</ref></blockquote>

==Later life and illness==
[[Image:Kazi Nazrul 1930s.png|thumb|left|200px|Nazrul, in the 1930s]]
In 1933, Nazrul published a collection of essays titled "Modern World Literature", in which he analyses different styles and themes of literature. Between 1928 and 1935 he published 10 volumes containing 800 songs of which more than 600 were based on classical ''[[ragas]]''. Almost 100 were folk tunes after ''[[kirtans]]'' and some 30 were patriotic songs. From the time of his return to Kolkata until he fell ill in 1941, Nazrul composed more than 2,600 songs, many of which have been lost.<ref name="MOF2"/> His songs based on ''baul'', ''jhumur'', [[Santhali]] folksongs, jhanpan or the folk songs of ''[[snake charmers]]'', ''bhatiali'' and ''bhaoaia'' consist of tunes of folk-songs on the one hand and a refined lyric with poetic beauty on the other. Nazrul also wrote and published poems for children.<ref name="MOF2"/> 

Nazrul's success soon brought him into Indian theatre and the then-nascent [[Cinema of India|film industry]]. The first picture for which he worked was based on [[Girish Chandra Ghosh]]'s story "Bhakta Dhruva" in 1934. Nazrul acted in the role of [[Narada]] and directed the film.  He also composed songs for it, directed the music and served as a [[playback singer]].<ref name="Banglapedia"/> The film "Vidyapati" ("Master of Knowledge") was produced based on his recorded play in 1936, and Nazrul served as the music director for the film adaptation of Tagore's novel ''Gora''. Nazrul wrote songs and directed music for [[Sachin Sengupta]]'s bioepic play "[[Siraj-ud-Daula]]". In 1939, Nazrul began working for Calcutta Radio, supervising the production and broadcasting of the station's musical programmes. He produced critical and analytic documentaries on music, such as "Haramoni" and "Navaraga-malika". Nazrul also wrote a large variety of songs inspired by the [[raga]] ''Bhairav''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Rafiqul |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.117 |chapter=Nazrul Islam}}</ref> Nazrul sought to preserve his artistic integrity by condemning the adaptation of his songs to music composed by others and insisting on the use of tunes he composed himself.

Nazrul's wife Pramila Devi fell seriously ill in 1939 and was paralysed from waist down. To provide for his wife's medical treatment, he resorted to mortgaging the royalties of his gramophone records and literary works for 400 rupees.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamal |first=Sajed |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.325 |chapter=Kazi Nazrul Islam: A Chronology of Life}}</ref> He returned to journalism in 1940 by working as chief editor for the daily newspaper "Nabayug" ("New Age"), founded by the eminent Bengali politician [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamal |first=Sajed |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.325 |chapter=Kazi Nazrul Islam: A Chronology of Life}}</ref>

Nazrul also was shaken by the death of Rabindranath Tagore on [[August 8]], [[1941]]. He spontaneously composed two poems in Tagore's memory, one of which, "Rabihara" (loss of Rabi or without Rabi) was broadcast on the [[All India Radio]]. Within months, Nazrul himself fell seriously ill and gradually began losing his power of speech. His behaviour became erratic, and spending recklessly, he fell into financial difficulties. In spite of her own illness, his wife constantly cared for her husband. However, Nazrul's health seriously deteriorated and he grew increasingly depressed. He underwent medical treatment under [[homeopathy]] as well as [[Ayurveda]], but little progress was achieved before mental dysfunction intensified and he was admitted to a mental asylum in 1942. Spending four months there without making progress, Nazrul and his family began living a silent life in India. In 1952, he was transferred to a mental hospital in [[Ranchi]]. With the efforts of a large group of admirers who called themselves the "Nazrul Treatment Society" as well as prominent supporters such as the Indian politician [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]], the treatment society sent Nazrul and Promila to [[London]], then to [[Vienna]] for treatment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamal |first=Sajed |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.326 |chapter=Kazi Nazrul Islam: A Chronology of Life}}</ref> Examining doctors said he had received poor care, and Dr. Hans Hoff, a leading [[neurosurgeon]] in Vienna, diagnosed that Nazrul was suffering from [[Pick's Disease]]. His condition judged to be incurable, Nazrul returned to [[Calcutta]] on 15 December 1953.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamal |first=Sajed |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=[[Mohammad Nurul Huda]] |others= |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Nazrul Institute |location=[[Dhaka]] |language= |isbn=984555167X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p.326 |chapter=Kazi Nazrul Islam: A Chronology of Life}}</ref>
On [[June 30]], [[1962]] his wife Pramila died and Nazrul remained in intensive medical care. In 1972, the newly independent nation of Bangladesh obtained permission from the [[Government of India]] to bring Nazrul to live in Dhaka and accorded him honorary citizenship.<ref name="Banglapedia" /> Despite receiving treatment and attention, Nazrul's physical and mental health did not improve. In 1974, his youngest son, Kazi Aniruddha, an eminent guitarist died, and Nazrul soon succumbed to his long-standing ailments on [[August 29]], [[1976]]. In accordance with a wish he had expressed in one of his poems, he was buried beside a mosque on the campus of the [[University of Dhaka]]. Tens of thousands of people attended his funeral; Bangladesh observed two days of national mourning and the [[Indian Parliament]] observed a minute of silence in his honour.<ref>{{cite web

==Criticism and legacy== 
[[Image:Nazrul Tomb 2.A.M.R.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Nazrul's tomb near the Dhaka University campus mosque]]

Nazrul's poetry is characterised by an abundant use of rhetorical devices, which he employed to convey conviction and sensuousness. He often wrote without care for organisation or polish. His works have often been criticized for [[egotism]], but his admirers counter that they carry more a sense of self-confidence than ego. They cite his ability to defy God yet maintain an inner, humble devotion to Him.<ref name="sedition"/> Nazrul's poetry is regarded as rugged but unique in comparison to Tagore's sophisticated style. Nazrul's use of [[Persian language|Persian]] vocabulary was controversial but it widened the scope of his work.<ref name="sedition"/> Nazrul's works for children have won acclaim for his use of rich language, imagination, enthusiasm and an ability to fascinate young readers.<ref name="sedition"/>

Nazrul pioneered new styles and expressed radical ideas and emotions in a large body of work. Scholars credit him for spearheading a cultural renaissance in Muslim-majority Bengal, "liberating" poetry and literature in Bengali from its medieval mould.<!--<ref name="KNS">{{cite web

He was awarded the [[Ekushey Padak]] by the Government of [[Bangladesh]]. He was awarded Honorary [[D.Litt.]] by the [[University of Dhaka]] . Many centres of learning and culture in India and Bangladesh have been founded and dedicated to his memory. The [[Nazrul Endowment]] is one of several scholarly institutions established to preserve and expound upon his thoughts and philosophy, as well as the preservation and analysis of the large and diverse collection of his works. The [[Bangladesh Nazrul Sena]] is a large public organization working for the education of children throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web
