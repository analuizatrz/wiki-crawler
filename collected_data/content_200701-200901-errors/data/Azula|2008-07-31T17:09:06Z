'''Princess Azula''' is a major antagonist in [[Nickelodeon]]'s animated television series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''. She is voiced by Grey DeLisle.

Azula is a gifted [[Firebender]] and highly favored [[princess]] of the [[Fire Nation]]. She is the Firebender silhouetted in the opening credits of each episode.  In addition, she is the first female Firebender to appear in the series.  She is initially depicted as bent on retrieving her exiled brother, [[Zuko|Prince Zuko]], and delivering him to their father, Fire Lord Ozai. During season two, she was accompanied on her search by her childhood friends, [[Mai (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Mai]] and [[Ty Lee]]. Season three sees the expansion of her personality, showing her softer side, full of hurt, misery, social awkwardness and inadequacy, as well as her eventual fall into complete insanity.

== Creation and conception ==
{{Expand|date=February 2008}}
=== Musical Theme ===
Azula's theme is based on the Fire Nation theme that can be heard throughout the series. The Fire Nation theme is mostly composed of drums, bass trombones and French horns in very low registers with chimes in the background.<ref name="ASNtrack3" /> Due to the masculine sound of the Fire Nation theme, the Track Team decided to alter it into a more feminine, but still powerful, sound for Azula, homing in on the background chimes heard in the Fire Nation theme. They combined the [[gamelan]]'s eerie bell like quality with a choir to highlight her rooted and refined evil. The theme is also supposed to help portray her as malevolent but not crazy.<ref name="ASNtrack3">{{cite web |url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/interviews.php?id=4 |title=Music Interview with the Track Team |accessdate=2008-04-08 |author=Acastus |date=2006-07-23 |work=Interview |publisher=Avatar Spirit.Net}}</ref>

== Plot overview ==
Azula first appears in a flashback, specifically Iroh's story about the [[Fire Nation#Agni Kai|Agni Kai]] in which Prince Zuko receives his facial scar and sentence of banishment.<ref name="The Storm">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=112|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=112|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Fans immediately began speculating upon who the girl standing next to Iroh might have been. Azula is not shown again until the end of the season, after the siege of the Northern Water Tribe, when Ozai orders Azula to arrest Zuko and Iroh for failure to capture the Avatar and betrayal against the Fire Nation respectively.<ref name="The Siege of the North Part 2">{{cite episode|title=The Siege of the North, Part II|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=120|airdate=2005-12-02|season=1|number=20|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=120|credits=Director: Dave Filoni; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

[[Image:Azula Hates Barbie2.png|thumb|right|250px|Azula's sadistic nature and evil ways were evident even as a child.]]
Although Azula's age is never stated in the series itself, the Avatar website gives her age at the time of her first non-flashback appearance as fourteen. This means that she would have been born to Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa around two years after her brother, [[Zuko]]. As such, she is the great-granddaughter of both Fire Lord Sozin, through Ozai, and Avatar Roku, through Ursa.<ref name="The Avatar And The Firelord">{{cite episode|title=The Avatar and the Firelord|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=306|airdate=2007-10-24|season=3|number=6|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=306|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

In another flashback, it is revealed that she is named after her grandfather, Ozai's father Azulon and that she and Azulon are both firebending prodigies.<ref name="Zuko Alone">{{cite episode|title=Zuko Alone|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=207|airdate=2006-05-12|season=2|number=7|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=207|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Even when she was [[Zuko Alone|a child]], Azula expressed her natural talents, along with her tendency for malice and perfectionism. Her sharp wit and the skill she displayed towards [[Firebending]] gained her much attention and acclaim, and her father showed her obvious favoritism, often at Zuko's expense.

Azula is depicted as interested in power from a very young age.  She is shown destroying a doll that her uncle had sent her and young Zuko mentions that she throws rocks at the tame turtle-ducks that live in their garden pond.  Young Azula suggests that her father would make a far better Fire Lord than the [[heir apparent]], her uncle, [[Uncle Iroh|Iroh]], whom she also dubbed "a quitter and a loser" for abandoning his siege at Ba Sing Se.<ref name="Zuko Alone">{{cite episode|title=Zuko Alone|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=207|airdate=2006-05-12|season=2|number=7|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=207|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
Years later, when her brother is burned by their father during an Agni Kai duel, she is shown watching with a savage triumph.<ref name="The Storm">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=112|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=112|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

Azula first encounters [[Aang|the Avatar]] in Omashu during the second season, where she and Aang battle. Soon after, she names the Avatar as a personal target in addition to her brother and enlists the help of her friends [[Ty Lee]] and [[Mai (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Mai]].<ref name="Return To Omashu">{{cite episode|title=Return to Omashu|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=203|airdate=2006-04-07|season=2|number=3|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=203|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Azula continues to pursue the Avatar for the rest of the season, becoming the position in the narrative that the character Zuko had held during the previous season. While in Ba Sing Se, though, Azula is sidetracked by her conquest of the city. Eventually, she is able to convince her brother to help her secure Ba Sing Se and take down the Avatar.  During their showdown in the catacombs, Azula appears to mortally wound Aang while he is in the Avatar State. It is assumed that the Avatar State has now become broken, and Aang is later shown explaining that his seventh [[chakra]] is now "locked." However, Azula suspects that Aang survived. She eventually blames this on her brother.<ref name="The Earth King">{{cite episode|title=The Earth King|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=218|airdate=2006-11-16|season=2|number=18|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=218|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: John O'Bryan|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

Upon returning home in the third season, it is revealed that Azula has not taken credit for the murder of the Avatar. She gave the credit to Zuko, claiming that she wanted to make him feel better as he faces their father and repay him for his aid in the siege of Ba Sing Se. After Zuko connotes that she's lying, Azula reveals that should the Avatar turn up still alive, all of Zuko's glory would turn to shame.<ref name="The Awakening">{{cite episode|title=The Awakening|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=301|airdate=2007-09-21|season=3|number=1|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=301|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> 

During "The Day of Black Sun," Azula serves as a distraction to keep Aang, Sokka, and Toph from finding Fire Lord Ozai, assisted by Dai Li agents.<ref name="The Eclipse">{{cite episode|title=The Day of Black Sun Part 2: The Eclipse|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=311|airdate=2007-11-26|season=3|number=11|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=311|credits=Director: Joaquim dos Santos; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Later, Azula accompanies [[Mai (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Mai]] and [[Ty Lee]] to the Boiling Rock, where Zuko has been captured, but Zuko, Sokka, Suki, and Hakoda escape.  During the escape, Mai attacks the guards attempting to stop their escape. Azula's calm breaks, and in a fury, she attempts to attack Mai, but is stopped by Ty Lee. After having Mai and Ty Lee locked away, a crazed Azula leads a platoon to the Western Air Temple. There she duels with Zuko until they are both thrown from the airship. She survives by propelling herself to safety.

In the finale, Ozai, after declaring himself the Phoenix King, names Azula as the new Fire Lord. However, Azula begins to show signs of strain. Deteriorating into paranoia, she is shown banishing nearly every one of her servants, including the Dai Li, for the slightest infractions and for fear that they would betray her. While preparing for her crowning Azula cuts a large portion of her hair off in frustration, giving her a deranged look that she keeps for the remainder of her appearances.  She then has a vision, possibly a [[hallucination]], of her mother inside a mirror who tells that she really loves her (Azula thought that her mother saw her as a Monster), and furiously throws her hair brush into the mirror upon her mother's proclamation of love for her. As she is about to be crowned, Zuko and Katara arrive and Azula challenges Zuko to an Agni Kai for the crown.  Detecting that Azula is "slipping," Zuko agrees and battles Azula, gaining the upper hand after a while. After Zuko taunts her, she charges up and attempts to strike Katara with lightning. Zuko instead throws himself in front of the lightning to save Katara. Katara is forced to dodge and evade Azula's wrath.  Katara eventually manages to freeze Azula and chain her hands together behind her back. 

Azula then begins to cry and scream in frustration, even going as far as to uncontrollably breathe flames from her mouth. This is the last time she is seen as she wasn't seen in the aftermath of her father's defeat. The Nick website explains that ''"After Zuko and Katara defeated her in the Agni Kai, Azula was shipped off to a Fire Nation Mental Health Facility on a nearby island where she is supervised around the clock".''

== Personality ==
Azula is a complex young woman. Ever since she was born, she was raised by her father to be a cruel, ruthless firebender and to manipulate people by controlling them through fear. She is a dedicated nationalist, relentlessly drilling herself towards perfection and will settle for nothing less.<ref name="The Avatar State" /> Even as a child she was seen to react with hostility when outdone. In a flashback, a young Azula is shown pushing Ty Lee over after Ty Lee beats her at cartwheeling.<ref name="Zuko Alone" /> She is rather vain and believes that power and domination are what makes a person strong.<ref name="The Crossroads of Destiny" /> She is known for being one of the cruelest characters in the series. From a young age, Azula demonstrated [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistic]] aggression and lack of remorse,<ref name="Zuko Alone" /> which suggest that Azula could be suffering from [[Dissocial personality disorder|dissocial personality disorder]]. She lacks empathy, treats people as objects and seems unable to view them as living beings with feelings and emotions.  Her cruelty and seemingly total lack of compassion extends to many born into her family.<ref name="Zuko Alone" /> Her [[apathy]] also accounts for her ability to create and direct [[lightning]], as the skill requires peace of mind<ref name="Bitter Work">.

|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>. It's this peace of mind that enables her to be such an excellent tactician, regularly displaying a perception and resourcefulness that allows her to take advantage of almost any situation as well as predict a person's actions and thoughts with confidence that she's right, referring to herself as a "people person". 

Ironically, for all her refinement and self-confidence, Azula does retain some insecurities. Although she is shown as a good strategist and capable of predicting what her enemies will do, she has a disadvantage in ordinary [[social ineptitude|social situations]]. In particular, she does not know how to act around teenaged boys, whom she tends to intimidate. Her over-competitive nature surfaces during a [[Footvolley|Kuai ball]] game, where, despite it being a friendly game, she turns an opponent's slight lameness against her and overly crushes her. She later admits her jealousy over how much attention [[Ty Lee]] receives from boys after making her cry and giving a quick apology. <ref name="The Beach">{{cite episode

|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender
|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> It later becomes apparent that her bullying and abusive treatment of people, even "friends" such as Mai and Ty Lee, stems not only from her cruel nature but a deep-rooted fear and inability to trust others. From a young age, she believed her mother favored Zuko and didn't love her, seeing her as a monster; while Ozai obviously favored her over Zuko, it is clear that Ozai is incapable of true, unconditional love and dispensed affection and favor to shape his two children as tools that would respond to his will.  This shaped Azula's fears that she couldn't count on love or affection from anyone, no matter how close they seemed. Unable to trust others, she instead tries to dominate them through fear - a paranoia that ultimately drives her insane following the betrayal of her closest friends.

== Abilities ==
Azula is proficient in the difficult technique of using lightning, a pure form of Firebending.<ref name="The Avatar State">{{cite episode

|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender
|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> The second most noticeable feature of Princess Azula's bending is her ability to create [[Firebending#Blue fire|blue flames]]. Azula has been seen using flames in previously unseen ways, such as jets of flames and whirling disks. Notably, Azula often firebends using only two fingers, rather than a closed fist or open hand.<ref name="Return To Omashu">{{cite episode

Azula can fight for long periods of time without tiring. (This discipline seems to deteriorate as her insanity grows; she strikes with careless attacks and giant, wasteful bursts of flame, explaining why she tires so easily in her final battle with Zuko.) She is also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames, which she once used to withstand the simultaneous combined attacks of Aang, Zuko, Katara and Toph.<ref name="The Chase">{{cite episode

She is able to propel herself, using her flames, in a manner similar to a rocket. This ability has also been extended as a means to fly for short periods of time as seen in the Boiling Rock.<ref name="The Crossroads of Destiny">{{cite episode

|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>. Azula is also a skilled melee fighter; in the "[[The Avatar State]]," she easily blocked or parried all of Zuko's attacks without the use of Firebending, and in "[[Avatar: The Last Airbender (season 3)|The Eclipse]]," avoided the combined forces of Aang, Toph, and Sokka for several minutes, without her bending to aid her.
She is an extremely skilled liar, as even Toph was unable to detect her lying.<ref name="The Eclipse">{{cite episode

(This ability to lie without altering her heart rate and breathing patterns may stem from her discipline, or from the detached aspect of her personality that allows her to inflict savage cruelty without any hint of hesitation or remorse.) She is also an accomplished tactician, as she was able to conquer Ba Sing Se, a city thought to be impenetrable.<ref name="The Crossroads of Destiny" /><ref name="The Awakening" />
