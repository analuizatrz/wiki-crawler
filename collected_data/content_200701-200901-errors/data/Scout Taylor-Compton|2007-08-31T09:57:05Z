'''Scout Taylor-Compton''' (born [[February 21]], [[1989]]) is an American actress whose film credits include ''Love's Unfolding Dream'', ''[[An American Crime]]'', ''[[Wicked Little Things]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Is Today (2006 film)|Tomorrow is Today]]'', ''[[Sleepover (2004 film)|Sleepover]]'', and ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]''.

She was born '''Desariee Starr Compton''' in [[Long Beach, California]]. Taylor-Compton was originally cast as one of the 'six chicks' in ''[[13 Going On 30]]''. Her role, as well as four of the other six chicks, were recast for appearing too old.  The original young Jenna and Matt were also recast.

On the morning of [[August 12]], [[2005]], Taylor-Compton disappeared from her home in [[Apple Valley]], [[California]] and was reported missing after an apparent family disagreement. She was found alive at a friend's house two weeks later, and was declared "a runaway who did not want to be found" by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's office.<ref name="scoutrunaway">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0174021/news News for Scout Taylor-Compton] Scout Taylor-Compton - accessed on [[3 January]], [[2007]]</ref> She had dyed her hair black and hid when officers arrived on scene.
