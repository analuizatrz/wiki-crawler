'''Dying Fetus''' is a [[Technical Death Metal]] band.  The band formed in [[1991]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], [[United States]]. As of [[2006]], its line-up consists of John Gallagher (guitar, vocals), Mike Kimball (guitar), Sean Beasley (bass) and Duane Timlin (drums).  

Dying Fetus's music is characterized by [[blast beat]]s, complex [[riff|riffing]] and slow [[breakdown (-core)|breakdowns]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. The vocals range from very low [[death grunt|death growls]] to more abrasive upper-throat screams. Lyrics-wise, the band dabbled in the usual gory death metal subject matter on their early albums, but by 2000’s ''Destroy the Opposition,'' the band had practically completely shifted to political lyrics, mostly consisting of aggressive critique addressed towards things such as [[religion]], [[corporation]]s, [[consumerism]] and [[war]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Following the release and tour of ''Destroy the Opposition'', in 2001, then-bassist/vocalist Jason Netherton and drummer [[Kevin Talley]] abandoned the band to form a new, more grindcore-influenced band, [[Misery Index (band)|Misery Index]]; they were later joined by another departing bandmate, Sparky Voyles. Without missing a beat, Gallagher recruited a completely new supporting line-up, which included Kimball, Beasely, and now-departed members Vince Matthews (vocals) and Erik Sayenga (drums), recording "Stop At Nothing,"

Since the release of "Stop At Nothing" in 2003 Erik Sayenga left the band and was replaced by drummer Duane Timlin. After much delay Dying Fetus' new album "War Of Attrition" was released on March 6th 2007 and so far has seen much praise from their longtime fans.
