'''Karben''' is a town in [[Hesse]],[[Germany]]. It is located 18 kilometres north of [[Frankfurt]] on the banks of the river [[Nidda River|Nidda]] in the Rhein-Main-Gebiet (Rhein-Main area). Karben as a unified city was founded in 1970, comprising some smaller villages (Klein-Karben, Gross-Karben, Okarben, Kloppenheim, Rendel, Burg-Gräfenrode, and Petterweil).

== History ==
The Karben area is rich in history. The village of Okarben was once location of a Roman military Castellum, forming a part of the Limes, the Roman imperial border defense network. 
Kloppenheim once belonged to an installation of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Knights Order]], who maintained a small palace there, which can still be visited. This also explains a Catholic majority in a village located in a mainly Protestant area. Gross Karben hosts two more manors which where inhabited by local landlords. The "Degenfeldsche Schloss" contains today a small museum on local history and a richly decorated chamber used for wedding ceremonies. The Leonhardi'sche Schloss was taken over by the newly created Freiherr von Leohardi family, who still inhabits the place. One more manor can be found in Burg-Gräfenrode (also known as Roggau) and was inhabited by an official for the Princes of Ysenburg und Büdingen who reigned most of the villages of Karben until the formation of the Deutsches Reich. Gross-Karben, Klein-Karben, Okarben, Burg-Gräfenrode and Rendel still have churches dating back from the Baroque period. Okarben experienced a face-change in the 19th century, when it started hosting workers for the newly established [[:de:Main-Weser-Bahn|Main-Weser Railroad]] between Frankfurt and Kassel. The city has transformed itself from a bundle of independent villages living mostly of farming the rich soils of the [[Wetterau]] to a slowly integrating city providing housing for a growing population of commuters and space for several small and mid-sized enterprises, while maintaining a lot of its original rural charme.
