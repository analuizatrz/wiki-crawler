The '''State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations''' (more commonly '''Rhode Island''') is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[New England (U.S.)|New England]] region of the [[northeastern United States]]. It is the smallest state by [[area]], and it is also the state with the longest official name. Rhode ({{IPA2|rod}}) Island was the first of the [[Thirteen colonies|thirteen original American colonies]] to [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|declare independence]] from British rule, signaling the start of the [[American Revolution]]. Rhode Islands was also the ''last'' state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]].

Despite most of the state being part of the [[mainland]], the name Rhode Island leads some out-of-staters to mistakenly believe that the entire state is an island, sometimes confusing it with [[Long Island, New York]], which is only about 100 miles southwest of Rhode Island across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{Fact|date=January 2007}} 

Rhode Island is nicknamed “Little Rhody” traditionally but the state officially adopted the nickname “the Ocean State”, as nearly one tenth Rhode Island's inland area is covered by salt water and no resident is more than a thirty-minute drive from the water's edge.<ref>http://providenceri.com/NarragansettBay/the_living_bay.html ''The Living Bay'' at Providenceri.com</ref>

==Name==
The state's common name, Rhode Island, actually refers only to the largest [[island]] in [[Narragansett Bay]], also known as [[Aquidneck Island]], itself a part of the state. Some historians think that the name is derived from “Roodt Eylandt” or “het Roode Eylandt”, old Dutch for “red island”, given to the island by Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]] due to the red clay on the island's shore.<ref>http://www.ri.gov/facts/history.php</ref> Other historians believe the name owes its origins to Italian explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], upon discovering nearby (present-day) [[Block Island]] named it Rhode Island because of its similarity in shape to the Greek island of [[Rhodes]]<ref>http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572815/Rhode_Island.html Rhode Island - MSN Encarta</ref>. Later settlers, mistaking which island Verrazzano was referring to, gave the name to Aquidneck Island instead.

{{see|List of Rhode Island counties}}

Rhode Island covers an area of approximately 1,214&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (3,144&nbsp; [[square kilometre|km²]]) and is bordered on the north and east by [[Massachusetts]], on the west by [[Connecticut]], and on the south by [[Rhode Island Sound]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It shares a water border with [[New York]] between [[Block Island]] and [[Long Island]]. The mean [[elevation]] of the state is 200&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (60&nbsp;[[meter|m]]). Located within the [[New England]] province of the [[Appalachian]] Region, Rhode Island has two distinct natural regions. Eastern Rhode Island contains the [[lowland]]s of the [[Narragansett Bay]], while Western Rhode Island forms part of the New England Upland. Narragansett Bay is a major feature of the state's topography. [[Block Island]] lies approximately 12 [[mile]]s (19&nbsp;km) off the southern coast of the mainland. Within the Bay, there are over 30 islands. The largest is Aquidneck Island, shared by the municipalities of [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Middletown, Rhode Island|Middletown]], and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]]. The second-largest island is [[Conanicut Island|Conanicut]]; the third-largest is [[Prudence Island|Prudence]].

Nicknamed the Ocean State, Rhode Island is home to a number of oceanfront [[List of beaches in New England#Rhode Island|beaches]]

Rhode Island is mostly flat with no real mountains. Rhode Island's highest natural point is [[Jerimoth Hill]], only 812 feet (247&nbsp;m) above sea level. <ref name=usgs/>

===Climate===
Rhode Island is an example of a warm summer [[humid continental climate]] with hot rainy summers and cold snowy winters. The highest temperature recorded in Rhode Island was 105 °[[Fahrenheit|F]] (40 °[[Celsius|C]]), recorded on August 2, 1975 at [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. The lowest temperature in Rhode Island, -13 °F (-25 °C), was recorded on February 6, 1996 at [[Greene, Rhode Island|Greene]]. Monthly average temperatures range from a high of 82 °F (28 °C) to a low of 20 °F (-7 °C).<ref>[http://www.rssweather.com/climate/Rhode%20Island/Providence/temp.png Average Temperature Range], RSSWeather.com</ref>
==History==
{{main|History of Rhode Island}}
===Colonial Era===
In 1614, the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block visited the island that is now called [[Block Island]]. Native American inhabitants included the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett tribe]], occupying most of the area, and the closely related [[Niantic (tribe)|Niantic]] tribe. Most of the Native Americans were decimated by introduced diseases, intertribal warfare, and the disastrous [[King Philip's War]], but remnants of the Niantic merged into the Narragansett tribe, where they remain on a federally recognized reservation.

In 1636, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], after being banished from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] for his religious views, settled at the tip of Narragansett Bay. He called the site Providence and declared it a place of religious freedom. 

The following year, [[Anne Hutchinson]] was banished from Massachusetts for criticizing the clergy there. She and some others, including [[William Coddington]] and [[John Clarke)|John Clarke]], founded the town of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island]]. In 1639, Coddington left Portsmouth and founded Newport on Aquidneck Island.

In that same year a formal government was established for the island. William Coddington was the first governor and [[Philip Sherman]] was the first Secretary. In 1643, [[Samuel Gorton]] founded Shawomet, which is now called [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]]. In 1644, the name of Aquidneck Island was changed to Rhode Island.

John Clarke was granted a Charter in 1663 for Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which effectively united the two colonies into one. Under the terms of the charter, only landowners could vote. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], when most people were employed as farmers, this was considered democratic. The original charter was used as the state constitution until 1842.

The relationship between the [[New Englanders]] and the Native Americans was strained, and caused some bloodshed. On December 19, 1675 colonist militia from Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island massacared about 350 Narragansetts in the Battle of the Great Swamp<ref>http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/regional_review/vol1-6f.htm</ref>.  The largest tribes that lived near Rhode island were the [[Wampanoag]], [[Pequots]], [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]], and [[Nipmuck]]. One native named [[Squanto]], from the Wampanoag tribe, stayed with the pilgrims and taught them many valuable skills needed to survive in the area. He also helped greatly with the eventual peace between the colonists and the natives.

Roger Williams had kept the powerful Narragansett on friendly terms with local white settlers. Having kept the powerful Narragansett tribe on friendly terms with settlers, the Narragansett were even persuaded to form an alliance with the [[English people|English]] in 1637 in carrying out an attack that nearly extinguished the warlike Pequots. However, this peace did not last long. By 1670 even the friendly tribes who had greeted Williams and the Pilgrims became estranged from the colonists and conflicts erupted.

The most important and traumatic event in 17th century Rhode Island was [[King Philip's War]], which occurred during 1675&ndash;1676. King Philip (his British nickname, his real name was [[Metacomet]]) was the chief of the Wampanoag Indians. The settlers of Portsmouth had purchased their land from his father, [[Massasoit]]. King Philip rebelled against the English. The first attacks were around Narrangansett Bay but spread throughout New England.

===Revolution and industrialization: 1770-1860===
Rhode Island's tradition of independence and dissent gave it a prominent role in the American Revolution.  In 1772, the first bloodshed of the American Revolution took place in Rhode Island when a band of Providence residents attacked a grounded British ship for enforcing unpopular British trade regulations in the incident which would be come to known as the [[Gaspee Affair]].  Keeping with its culture of defiance, Rhode Island was the first of the original thirteen colonies to declare its independence from England ([[May 4]], [[1776]],<ref>[http://www.sec.state.ri.us/library/riinfo/riinfo/knowrhode Know Rhode Island], RI Secretary of State. Accessed [[October 17]], [[2006]].</ref>) and the last to ratify the Constitution (which replaced the Articles of Confederation)([[May 29]], [[1790]])&mdash;doing the latter only after being threatened with having its exports taxed as a foreign nation.

As the Industrial Revolution moved large numbers of workers into the cities, a permanently landless, and therefore voteless, class developed. By 1829, 60% of the state's free white males were ineligible to vote.

Several attempts had been made to address this problem, but none passed. In 1842, [[Thomas Dorr]] drafted a liberal [[constitution]] which was passed by popular referendum. However, the conservative sitting governor, [[Samuel Ward King]], opposed the people's wishes, leading to the [[Dorr Rebellion]]. Although this collapsed, a modified version of the constitution was passed in November, which allowed any white male to vote that he owned land or could pay a US $1 [[poll tax]].

In addition to industrialization, Rhode Island was heavily involved in the slave trade during the post-revolution era. Slavery was extant in RI as early as 1652, and by 1774, the slave population of RI was 6.3%, nearly twice as high as any other New England Colony. In the late Eighteenth century, several Rhode Island merchant families began actively engaging in the triangle slave trade. Notable among these was the Brown family, for whom Brown University is named, although some important Browns became prominent abolitionists. In the years after the Revolution, Rhode Island merchants controlled between 60 and 90% of the American trade in African slaves.<ref>[http://www.slavenorth.com/rhodeisland.htm Slavery in Rhode Island], from Slavery in the North. Accessed [[October 17]], [[2006]]</ref><ref>[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Info/Slavery.html Slavery, the Brown Family of Providence, and Brown University], Brown News Bureau. Accessed [[October 17]], [[2006]]</ref>

===Civil War to Progressive Era: 1860-1929===
During the Civil War, Rhode Island was one of the Union states. Rhode Island furnished 25,236 fighting men, of which 1,685 died. On the home front, Rhode Island, along with the other northern states, used its industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials it needed to win the war. Rhode Island's continued growth and modernization led to the creation of an urban mass transit system, and improved health and sanitation programs. After the war, in 1866, Rhode Island abolished racial segregation throughout the state.<ref>
http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt5.html Accessed 3/28/06</ref> Post-war immigration increased the population. From the 1860s to the 1880s, most of the immigrants were from England, Ireland, Germany, Sweden, and Quebec. Towards the end of the century however, most immigrants were from South and Eastern Europe, and the Mediterranean.<ref>http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt6.html
Accessed 3/28/06</ref> At the turn of the century, Rhode Island had a booming economy, which fed the demand for immigration. In the years that lead up to [[World War I]], Rhode Island's constitution remained reactionary, in contrast to the more progressive reforms that were occurring in the rest of the country. The state never ratified the 18th Amendment establishing national Prohibition of alcohol. <ref>[http://www.coolquiz.com Cool Quiz]</ref> During World War I, Rhode Island furnished 28,817 troops, of whom 612 died. After the war, the state was hit hard by the [[Spanish Influenza]].<ref>http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt7.html Accessed 3/28/06</ref>

===Great Depression to present: 1929-===
In the twentieth century, the state continued to grow, though the decline in industry devastated many urban areas.  These areas were impacted further, as with the rest of the country's urban areas by construction of [[Interstate]] highways through city cores and the suburbanization caused by it and the [[GI Bill]].

Since the Great Depression, the Rhode Island Democratic Party has dominated local politics. For years, the Speaker of the House, always a Democrat, has been one of the most powerful figures in government{{Fact|date=January 2007}}. The Democratic Party's core of support is in the urban areas of the state and immediate suburbs. While known for old school politics and corruption, Rhode Island also has comprehensive health insurance for low-income children, the RITE CARE program, as well as a large social safety net. Despite this, many urban areas still have a high rate of children in poverty. Due to an influx of residents from Boston, increasing housing costs have resulted in more homeless in Rhode Island (from about 3,000 individuals in 1999 to over 6,000 today), as well as a doubling of the cost of an average home<ref>http://204.17.79.244/profiles/cw_pro.html Providence Neigborhood Profiles</ref>. 

The Republican Party, virtually non-existent in the state legislature, has successfully put forward occasional state-wide "good government" [[reform]] candidates who criticize the state's high taxes and the excesses of the Democratic Party. [[Stephen Laffey]] current Mayor of [[Cranston, Rhode Island|Cranston]], current Governor [[Donald Carcieri]] of East Greenwich, and former Mayor [[Vincent Cianci, Jr|Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci]] of Providence (who later became an independent, political boss, and was convicted on RICO charges) ran as Republican reform candidates.

Prominent State Democrats include House Speaker William Murphy, Senate President Joseph Montalbono, Providence Mayor David Cicilline, Secretary of State A Ralph Mollis, Senate Majority Leader M. Teresa Paiva-Weed, and Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts. In recent years, the former Speaker of the House John Harwood, State Senator John Celona, and State Senate President William Irons were forced to resign in scandals.

==Law and government==
{{main|Government of Rhode Island}}
The [[capital]] of Rhode Island is [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].  The state's current governor is [[Donald Carcieri]] (R) and its United States Senators are [[Jack Reed]] (D) and [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D).  Rhode Island's two United States Congressmen are [[Patrick J. Kennedy]] (D-1) and [[Jim Langevin]] (D-2). {{see|List of Rhode Island Governors}}

The [[state legislature]] is the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]], consisting of the 75-member state [[Rhode Island House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the 38-member [[Rhode Island Senate|Senate]]. Both houses of the [[bicameral]] body are currently dominated by the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].

Federally, Rhode Island is one of the most reliably [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] states during presidential elections, regularly giving the Democratic nominees one of their best showings. In 1980, Rhode Island was one of only 6 states to vote against [[Ronald Reagan]]. In the 1984 Reagan landslide, Rhode Island provided [[Walter Mondale]] with his 3rd best performance. Rhode Island was the Democrats' best state in 1988 and 2000 and 2nd best in 1996 and 2004. The state was devoted to [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] until 1908, but has only strayed from the Democrats 7 times in the 24 elections that followed. In 2004, Rhode Island gave [[John Kerry]] a greater than 20 percentage point margin of victory (the third highest of any state) with 59.4% of its vote. All but two of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate. The only exceptions were [[East Greenwich, Rhode Island|East]] and [[West Greenwich, Rhode Island|West Greenwich]].

== Economy ==
{{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}}
Rhode Island is known as the "birthplace of the [[Economic history of the United States|American]] [[Industrial Revolution]]"{{Fact|date=January 2007}}. It was in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] that [[Samuel Slater]] set up his first mill in 1790, using the waterpower of the [[Blackstone River]] to power his mill. For a while, Rhode Island was one of the leaders in [[textiles]]. However, with the [[Great Depression]], most textile factories relocated to the American South. Textiles still constitute a part of the Rhode Island economy, but does not have the same power that it once had. An interesting by-product of the textile industry is the amount of abandoned factories - many of them now are used for low-income or elderly housing or have been converted into offices or trendy condos. In Pawtucket, these abandoned mills are used as housing for artists.

The Fortune 500 companies [[CVS Corporation|CVS]] and [[Textron]] are based in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island]] respectively.  [[FM Global]], [[Hasbro]], [[American Power Conversion]], [[Nortek]], and [[Amica Mutual Insurance]] are all Fortune 1000 companies based in Rhode Island.  The [[GTECH]] Corporation is headquartered in Providence.

Rhode Island's 2000 total gross state product was $33 billion, placing it 45<sup>th</sup> in the nation. Its 2000 ''per capita'' Personal Income was $29,685, 16<sup>th</sup> in the nation.  Rhode Island has the lowest level of energy consumption per capita of any state.<ref>http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0106.html Energy Infomation Association</ref>

Health services are Rhode Islands largest industry. Second is tourism, supporting 39,000 jobs, with tourism related sales at $3.26 billion in the year 2000. The third largest industry is manufacturing. Its industrial outputs are fashion jewelry, fabricated metal products, electric equipment, machinery, shipbuilding and boatbuilding. Rhode Island's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, vegetables, dairy products, and eggs.

{{US Demographics}}
The [[center of population]] of Rhode Island is located [[Providence County, Rhode Island|Providence County]], in the city of [[Cranston, Rhode Island|Cranston]].<ref>http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt</ref>

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2005, Rhode Island has an estimated population of 1,076,189, which is a decrease of 3,727, or 0.3%, from the prior year and an increase of 27,870, or 2.7%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 15,220 people (that is 66,973 births minus 51,753 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 14,001 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 18,965 people, and migration within the country produced a net decrease of 4,964 people.

The five largest ancestry groups in Rhode Island are: [[Italian-American|Italian]] (19%), [[Ireland|Irish]] (18.4%), [[French-Canadian]] (17.3%),<ref>[http://www.riedc.com/files/census2kprofile-ri.pdf]</ref> [[British-American|English]] (12%), [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]] (8.7%).

According to the [[2000 U.S. Census]], 8.07% of the population aged 5 and over speaks [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at home, while 3.80% speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], 1.96% [[French language|French]], and 1.39% [[Italian language|Italian]] [http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=44&mode=state_tops].

6.1% of Rhode Island's population were reported as under 5, 23.6% under 18, and 14.5% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 52% of the population.

Rhode Island has a higher percentage of [[Italian-Americans]] (concentrated in the city of Providence) and a higher percentage of Americans of Portuguese ancestry (who dominate Bristol county) than any other state in the nation. [[French Canadians]] form a large part of Northern Providence county whereas [[Irish American|Irish-Americans]] have a strong presence in Newport and Kent counties. Yankees of English ancestry still have a presence in the state as well, especially in Washington county, and are often referred to as "[[Swamp Yankees]]."

===Religion===
{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

The religious affiliations of the people of Rhode Island are:
[[Christianity|Christian]] &ndash; 81%
([[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Roman Catholic]] &ndash; 56%,
[[Protestantism|Protestant]] &ndash; 28%,
[[Episcopalian]] &ndash; 8%,
[[Baptist]] &ndash; 6%,
Other Protestant &ndash; 10%,
Other Christian &ndash; 1%),
[[Judaism|Jewish]] &ndash; 2%,
Other Religions &ndash; 1%,
Non-Religious &ndash; 16%.

Rhode Island is home to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence]] and the [[Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island]]. 

Rhode Island has the highest percentage of [[Roman Catholic church|Catholics]] in the nation mainly due to large [[Irish-American|Irish]], [[Italian-American|Italian]] and [[French Canadian]] immigration and to a lesser extent Portuguese, Puerto Rican, and Cape Verdean communities in the state.

== Culture ==
{{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}}

Many Rhode Islanders speak with non-rhotic accent that many compare to a "Brooklyn" or a cross between a New York and [[Boston accent]]. The [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|letter 'r' is often dropped]] at the end of a word, ("water" becomes "wata"). [[Linking consonant|The letter 'r' is also added in to the ending of words]] in a rhotic [[hypercorrection]] ("soda" becomes "soder", "idea" becomes "idear"). Many Rhode Islanders pronounce the 'aw' sound as one might hear in New Jersey; e.g., "coffee" is pronounced "cauwwefee."  

It is a fairly common stereotype that Rhode Islanders are very superstitious, although this has not been scrutinized statistically{{Fact|date=January 2007}}{{or}}. However, the belief in [[vampires]], especially in the rural parts of the state, was widespread up until the late 19th century. There are several well-documented cases in which families disenterred deceased relatives{{Fact|date=January 2007}}, then removed and burned their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for illness and misfortune that the family had been suffering. The most famous of these cases is that of 19-year-old Mercy Brown who died in [[Exeter, Rhode Island]] in 1892. It is believed that this widely-reported event inspired much of Bram Stoker's novel [[Dracula]]. 

The Fox show ''[[Family Guy]]'' takes place in a fictional town in Rhode Island named [[Quahog (Family Guy)|Quahog]].  Although that town may not be intended to have a particular real-world counterpart, several real Rhode Island cities are mentioned and used.  Pawtucket, Barrington, Newport and Providence are all real places.

The state was notorious for organized crime activity from the 1950s into the 1990s when the Patriarca crime family held sway over most of New England from their Providence headquarters. Although the power of organized crime has greatly diminished in Rhode Island over the last 20 years, its residents are still stigmatized by popular perceptions of rampant graft and corruption that have haunted the state for decades.

Rhode Islanders developed a unique style of architecture in the 17th century, called the [[stone-ender]].

Rhode Island is the only state to still celebrate Victory over Japan day.

==Food==
Rhode Island is a large per capita consumer of coffee. According to a Providence Journal article, Providence features the highest number of coffee/donut shops per capita in the country, with over 100 [[Dunkin' Donuts]] locations in the state alone<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanplanet.org/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t5597.html Providence Journal|title=Chewing over why we love doughnut shops|author=Patinkin, Mark|accessdate=2007-01-20}}</ref>. It is common belief that more coffee ice cream is sold here per-capita than any other state{{{or}}. The Official State Drink of Rhode Island is [[coffee milk]],<ref>[http://www.ri.gov/facts/ RI Government Facts and History]</ref> a beverage created by mixing milk with coffee syrup. This unique syrup was invented in the state and is bottled and sold in most Rhode Island supermarkets. Interestingly, although coffee milk contains some caffeine, it is sold in school cafeterias throughout the state.  Frozen lemonade, a mixture of ice-slush, lemons and sugar is also immensely popular in the summer, especially [[Dels|Del's Frozen Lemonade]], a company based in [[Cranston]].

Several foods and dishes are unique to Rhode Island, and cannot be found outside of the state. "[[Wiener]]s," which are sometimes called "gaggers" or "weenies" are smaller than a standard hot dog but are covered in a meat sauce, chopped onions, [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], and [[celery salt]]. The most common way the word is spelled on menus is "weiner." Many restaurants advertise "New York System" weiners.  However, this item cannot be found in New York; legend has it that the term was coined by Greek immigrants who wanted to increase sales of weiners that they sold.  Submarine sandwiches are referred to as "grinders" in Rhode Island with a popular version being the Italian grinder, which is made with Italian cold cuts (usually ham, [[prosciutto]], [[capicola]], [[salami]], and [[Provolone cheese]]). [[Chouriço]] (a spicy Portuguese sausage) and peppers, eaten with hearty bread, is also popular among the state's large Portuguese community. "Dynamites" are most popular in Woonsocket and are similar to a sloppy joe, except served with peppers and onions in a torpedo roll. Another popular item is pizza strips, sold in most supermarkets - basically, they are rectangular strips of pizza without the cheese. Spinach pies, similar to a calzone but filled with seasoned spinach instead of meat, sauce and cheese, are sold in many Italian bakeries and local supermarkets. Variations can include black olives or pepperoni with the spinach, or omission of spinach entirely in favor of broccoli. 

The Ocean State's tradition of seafood is one of the most celebrated in the country. [[Shellfish]] is extremely popular, with clams being used in multiple ways. The Quahog (whose shell is Rhode Island's state shell) is a large clam which is mixed with stuffing and spicy minced sausage and then baked in the shell to form a "Stuffie." Steamed clams are also a very popular dish. Fried squid, or "calamari," are fried squid rings and are most popular in Italian restaurants.

Rhode Island, like the rest of New England, has a long tradition of clam [[chowder]]. While the White "New England" variety is popular and the Red "Manhattan" variety is not uncommon, Rhode Island makes a clear chowder, affectionately known as "Rhode Island Clam Chowder."

Perhaps the most peculiar culinary tradition in Rhode Island is the "clamcake." The clamcake is a deep fried ball of buttery dough with chopped bits of clam inside of it. They are sold in most seafood restaurants around the state, and usually come by the half-dozen or dozen. The quintessential summer meal in Rhode Island is "chowder and clam cakes."

It is also said that clams casino originated in Rhode Island after being "invented" by Julius Keller, the maitre d' in the original Casino next to the seaside Towers in Narragansett{{or}}. Clams Casino resemble the beloved stuffed quahog but are generally made with the smaller littleneck or cherrystone clam and are unique in their use of bacon as a topping.

Though Soupie is found not exclusively in the Rhode Island, it is a large part of Rhode Island culture. Many Rhode Islanders will have soupie parties and make large amounts of soupie in their homes. Soupie is a Westerlian (Natives of Westerly) tradition of all families...due to the fact that many Westerlians are Italian{{or}}{{Fact|date=January 2007}}.
