'''Cao Chun''' ([[170]] &ndash; [[210]]) was a [[cavalry]] general under the powerful [[warlord]] [[Cao Cao]] during the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] and [[Three Kingdoms Period]] in ancient [[China]]. He commanded the elite mounted force &ndash; the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry (虎豹骑) &ndash; in several campaigns against [[Yuan Tan]], [[Ta Dun]] and [[Liu Bei]]. 

==Life==

Born in 170, Cao Chun was a younger brother of [[Cao Ren]]. When Cao Chun was thirteen, their father died and the brothers took over the family estates and several hundred servants in their employ, whom Cao Chun managed well. Being well-learned himself, Cao Chun also befriended scholars, who flocked to him.

At seventeen, Cao Chun entered the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] imperial court in [[Luoyang]] as the Attendant at the Yellow Gates (黄门侍郎, a spokesman for the emperor). In 189, Cao Chun joined his elder cousin [[Cao Cao]]'s army and followed him to war against [[Dong Zhuo]], the tyrannical warlord who held the emperor hostage.

During a siege on [[Yuan Tan]] in [[Nanpi]] (南皮) in early 205, Cao Chun commanded the elite mounted force &ndash; the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry. In the initial stage of the confrontation, Cao Cao's troops suffered significant losses to skirmishes by the enemy but eventually prevailed. Cao Chun's men took the head of Yuan Tan.

In the subsequent northern expedition against the [[Wuhuan]] tribe, Cao Chun's force again excelled in battle. The riders captured [[Ta Dun]], chief of the Wuwan. For his credits, Cao Chun was enfeoffed as Tinghou¹ of Gaoling (高陵亭侯) with stipends from 300 households.

In 208, Cao Chun accompanied Cao Cao south on the campaign to take the [[Jingzhou (region)|Jingzhou]]. At [[Xiangyang]], Cao Chun and his men was sent ahead to pursue the retreating force of [[Liu Bei]]. They caught Liu Bei at [[Battle of Changban|Changban]] and in the ensuing encounter, captured Liu Bei's two daughters and supplies, as well as some enemy troops.

Cao Chun pressed on south to secure the strategic city of [[Jiangling]], which had a cache of armaments and a sizeable river fleet. He then returned to his hometown, where he died in 210. According to the ''Book of Wei'', Cao Cao favored Cao Chun so much that he refused to appoint anyone to succeed the commandership of the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry.

In 220, Cao Cao's successor [[Cao Pi]] conferred Cao Chun the posthumous title of Marquis Wei (威侯), literally meaning the awe-inspiring marquis. Cao Chun's son Cao Yan (曹演) also served in the military and was eventually promoted to Lingjun General (领军将军) and Xianghou¹ of Pingle (平乐乡侯).

¹ <small>The title of marquis was divided into three grades under the [[Kingdom of Wei]] during the late [[Han Dynasty]] and [[Three Kingdoms period]]. These are, in ascending order of prestige, ''tinghou'' (亭侯), ''xianghou'' (乡侯) and ''xianhou'' (县侯).</small>
