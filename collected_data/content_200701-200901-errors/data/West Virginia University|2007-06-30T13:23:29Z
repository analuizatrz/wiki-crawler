'''West Virginia University''' is an institution of higher learning based in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States of America|USA]], with the off-site campuses of [[West Virginia University at Parkersburg]] in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]], [[West Virginia University Institute of Technology]] in [[Montgomery, West Virginia|Montgomery]], [[Potomac State College of West Virginia University]] in [[Keyser, West Virginia|Keyser]], and an additional clinical campus for the university's medical and dental schools at [[Charleston Area Medical Center]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]].  Since 1989, WVU has been governed by the [[West Virginia University]] [[Board of Governor's]].

WVU was founded in 1867 as a [[land-grant university]] with the help of the [[Morrill Act]], and was originally the '''Agricultural College of West Virginia'''. The university changed its name in [[1868]].  Enrollment for the Fall 2007 semester was 27,120.

The university offers 179 majors in 15 colleges and has produced 25 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]]<ref>[http://www.nis.wvu.edu/intro WVU At A Glance]</ref>, including [[David C. Hardesty, Jr.]], WVU president [[2007|as of 2007]].  The university has also produced 30 [[Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship|Goldwater Scholars]], 18 [[Truman Scholar]]s, five members of ''[[USA Today]]'' 's All-USA College Academic First Team, and two [[Udall Scholarship]] winners.

On April 13, 2007 West Virginia University announced that their next president would be Michael Garrison. This announcement has been heavily scrutinized by the faculty of the university which accused the search commitiee of unethical search and selection practices due to Garrison's political ties to West Virginia State government. Garrison will officially begin work in July and will take the helm fully at the start of the 2007 Fall Semester.

Within the past several years West Virginia University has implemented a separate Criminology & Investigative Sciences major which is rooted heavily in Sociology & Anthropology disciplines. The program is geared towards students who are interested in a career in law enforcement, and other investigative realted professions.

==Libraries==
[[Image:WVRHClogo.gif|right|150px]]

The [[West Virginia and Regional History Collection]], the world's largest collection of West Virginia related research material, is located in the Wise Library on the Downtown Campus.  According to the university<ref>[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/collections/wv.htm West Virginia Collection General Information]</ref>, the collection includes over 4,500,000 [[manuscript]] documents, 30,000 books, 15,000 pamphlets, 1,200 [[newspapers]], 100,000 [[photographs]] and prints, 5,000 maps, and 25,000 [[microfilm]]s, [[oral histories]], films and [[folk music]] recordings. It is often called simply the "West Virginia Collection." 

In addition to this collection, the univeristy also maintains seven other libraries on its campuses (six of which are located in Morgantown with the other in Charleston, WV).  These libraries include the Downtown Campus Library, Evansdale Library, Health Sciences Library, Law Library, Math Library, Media Services, and the WVU Charleston Health Sciences Library.  The collections in these libraries include the Appalachian Collection, Book Depository, Digital Collections, Government Documents, West Virginia Historical Art Collection, Map Room, Myers Collection, Patent and Trademarks, Rare Books Collections, and Theses and Dissertations.  In all, West Virginia University libraries contain nearly 1.5 million printed volumes, 2.3 million microforms, more than 10,000 electronic journals, and many computers with high speed internet access.<ref>[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/friends/ West Virginia Collection Welcome Page]</ref>

The university co-publishes, with the [[United Association for Labor Education]], ''[[Labor Studies Journal]]''.

==Campus==
The Morgantown campus is split into three sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is located in downtown Morgantown. The Evansdale Campus was constructed in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] about a mile away on a high rise above the [[Monongahela River]] with the intention of improving facilities and services to the growing student population. 

The third is the Health Sciences Campus which includes the WVU Heatlth Sciences Center, Ruby Memrorial Hospital, Chestnut Ridge Hospital, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, UHA Physicians Office Center, Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute and, WVU Eye Institute, WVU Center on Aging, and WVU Children's Hospital.

== PRT System / Campus Transportation==
{{main|Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit}}
Because of the issue of WVU's split campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, and Health Sciences) one of the major icons at the school is the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|Personal Rapid Transit]] system that links them.

In 1974, [[Boeing]] began construction on the major PRT project in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], designed to shuttle students between WVU's three campuses. The school's original main campus, the Downtown Campus, is located in the valley of the Monongahela River. The Evansdale Campus, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, is on a high rise directly above the river, taking it out of the flood plain, but still in the valley. Because it proved impossible to develop any more valley land, WVU expanded to a separate parcel a couple of miles away on the other side of a ridge (today's Health Sciences Campus).

The WVU PRT began operation in 1975. US [[President Nixon]]'s daughter, Tricia, was onboard one of five demonstration cars for a demonstration ride.<ref>[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4104/ WVU News and Information Services July 13, 2004 "WVU PRT station to bear name of people-mover's creator"]</ref>. There was an interruption in service during the 1978/1979 school year to allow system expansion from the Engineering station to new stations at the "Towers" dormitories and the WVU Medical Center. During this time, WVU provided bus service between the campuses.  The PRT handles about 16,000 riders per day (as of 2005), and uses approximately 70 vehicles.

The system has five stations (Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical) and 8.7 miles of guideway (approx. 14 km) track. The vehicles are rubber-tired and run along electrified rails. [[Steam]] heating keeps the elevated guide way free of snow and ice. Most students habitually use it. This system was not sold to other sites because the heated track has proven too expensive.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}  In order to board the PRT, one may either pay a nominal fare, or swipe their Mountaineer Card, an ID that also acts as debit plan, library card and unlimited transit pass. The cars are blue with gold trim and the school logo, as well as the school name printed on the front of each. Inside, the seats are light beige [[fiberglass]] and the interior carpet is brown. Each car has eight seats, and an overall advertised capacity of 20 people including standing room. 

The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] named the WVU PRT one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972,<ref>[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4104/ ''ibid'']</ref> and in 1998 ''The New Electric Railway Journal'' picked the WVU PRT over [[PeopleMover|Walt Disney World's monorail]] as the greatest people mover in the United States.<ref>[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4104/ ''ibid'']</ref>

In 2006, the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] dubbed WVU one of the best workplaces for commuters.<ref>[http://www.nis.wvu.edu/2006/workplace_award.htm ''WVU named one of `best workplaces’ for commuters by EPA, DOT'']</ref>

Each autumn during the annual Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is brought in front of the [[MountainLair]] [[student activity center|student union]] where students participate in the "PRT Cram".  The purpose of the event is for student organizations to organize groups who attempt to squeeze as many people into the PRT car as possible.  A record was set in 2000, with 97 people.

Additionally, students may utilize one of the university operated buses to get around town. The university buses operate in most of the main areas of campus daily as well as the community bus service Mountain Line which operates all day, evening and until the early morning hours. Students may use their Mountaineer Card (student ID) to ride the Mountain Line bus for free. The Health Science Center also operates a shuttle service to help students, visitors and patients to get to and from the Health Science Center campus. Many non-university, private student housing communities in the area also operate a shuttle to campus/town and back to the housing community.

==Residential Education==
[[Image:Boreman Hall South.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Boreman Hall]], one of the oldest residence halls on campus.]]
The Residential Education Program (ResEd), enacted in 1995, works to promote "student success by easing the transition from high school to college and to personalize the freshman experience".<ref>[http://admissions.wvu.edu/undergraduate/discover/resident_faculty.asp WVU Admissions Dept.]</ref>  During the Move-In or Welcome Weekend, returning upperclassmen sometimes volunteer to help the new students and are known as Residential Education HOTSHOTS. They help carry items, give directions, and answer questions. Although a campus-wide plan, ResEd focuses on the university's 14 [[residence halls]].  Each hall is assigned a Resident Faculty Leader (RFL, pronounced riffle) who oversees programming and lives in a house (usually next door to the hall) where students hold Hall Council meetings and other events. Each hall is also assigned a Residence Hall Coordinator (RHC) who works with the RFL  and is responsible for daily operations, including enforcement of hall regulations.  Along with these two positions are Resident Assistants (RA) in most halls, Graduate Assistants (GA)in some halls, and Resident Tutors (RT) in Lincoln Hall. All three groups are students who have lived in the residence halls for at least one year and are each responsible for the daily operations of one floor or area. At Night and in the early morning hours all halls are staffed by "Night Staff" these are often graduate or non-tradional students who get paid to work the desk and lobby areas of the halls and to walk the floors. 

Several residence halls offer peer tutors or other tutoring programs to assist students having academic difficuluty. 

In several of the halls a Police Officer from the WVU Police Department is staioned in the hall or nearby most nights of the week. The officer who assists Night Staff and RAs is also there to deter and address any criminal incidents which might occur, including problems with intoxicated individuals, illicit drug use, and thefts. The officers also routinly give safety, alcohol and drug presentations to students residing in the halls. 

== Athletics ==
{{main|West Virginia Mountaineers}}
The school's sports teams are called the Mountaineers and compete in the [[Big East Conference]], a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I.  The school has teams in 13 college sports and has won several national championships, including 13 [[NCAA Rifle Championship]]s as of 2007.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Mountaineer sports were started in 1891 when a group of students organized the first football game at the school.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Notable athletes from West Virginia University include Stan "The Man" Boskovich, [[Jerry West]], [[Sam Huff]], [[Rod Hundley|"Hot Rod" Hundley]], [[Rod Thorn]], [[Joe Stydahar]], [[Jeff Hostetler]], [[Major Harris]], [[Dan Mozes]], [[Jerry Porter]], [[Kevin Pittsnogle]], [[Marc Bulger]], [[Avon Cobourne]], [[Mike Vanderjagt]], [[Todd Sauerbrun]], [[Pacman Jones|Adam "Pacman" Jones]], wrestlers [[Greg Jones]], Nate Carr and Mike Mason, [[Georgann Wells]] (first female player to register a dunk in a collegiate basketball game),<ref>[http://www.wvculture.org/HISTORY/sports/wellsgeorgeann02.html ''Morgantown Dominion Post'' (Dec. 23, 1984): "Wells Encores With School Scoring Mark" (unbylined), via West Virginia Division of Culture and History]</ref> [[Amos Zereoue]], [[Quincy Wilson]], [[Chris Henry]], [[Mike Gansey]], and [[Johannes Herber|Joe Herber]].

==Student newspaper==
{{main|The Daily Athenaeum}}
''The Daily Athenaeum'', nicknamed "The DA", is the 10th-largest newspaper in West Virginia{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. It generates income through advertisement sales. The paper began in 1887 as a a weekly [[literary magazine]], with production taken over by newly formed  journalism school in the [[1920s]].  In 1970, the paper split from the school of journalism and became an independent campus entity governed by the Student Publications Board. The ''DA'' was voted as the ''[[Princeton Review]]'s'' 10th-best college newspaper in the United States in 2005 and 15th in 2006.<ref>[http://www.princetonreview.com Princeton Review Homepage (Login Required)]</ref>

==School Traditions==
===Flying WV===
[[Image:Goldoutline115w.gif|right|The "Flying WV"]]
The logo of the university is known as the "Flying WV.

===The Mountaineer===
The Mountaineer was adopted in 1890 as the official school mascot.  A new Mountaineer is selected every year during Mountaineer Week. The candidates for Mountaineer must have at least a 2.5 GPA, write an essay about why they want to be the Mountaineer, and gain the most cheers during a home basketball game. The candidate who wins the most cheers is given the title The Mountaineer of West Virginia University. Although men typically are chosen for the role of the Mountaineer, there has been at least one woman chosen, Natalie Tennant. The candidate chosen for the role of Mountaineer receives a scholarship, a buckskin suit that is tailor made, a rifle, powder horn, and travels with the sports teams for one year.

==="Take Me Home, Country Roads"===
The [[John Denver]] song "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]" is commonly played at most home sporting events as well as other occasions on campus.  In 1980, Denver helped to dedicate the new Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium, and led the crowd in a sing-along of the song. It then became a tradition, after a victory, for fans to stay in the stands and sing it along with the football team.<ref>''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (month n.a., 2006): "102 More Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate"</ref>

===Mountaineer Marching Band===
[[Image:sugar bowl06.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Pride of West Virginia at the 2006 Nokia Sugar Bowl]]
The WVU Marching Band, nicknamed The Pride of West Virginia, was formed in 1901 as an all-male [[ROTC]] band. It performs at every home football game and makes other appearances on- and off-campus throughout the year.

During its traditional pre-game performance, the band enters [[Milan Puskar Stadium|Milan Puskar Stadium at Mountaineer Field]] from end-zone tunnels to a spirited, 220-beats per minute "run on" cadence. The band plays several university songs and favorites including: "Fight, Mountaineers," "Mountain Dew," "Simple Gifts" (from ''[[Appalachian Spring]]''), "West Virginia University's Alma Mater," "The Star Spangled Banner," "Country Roads," and "Hail West Virginia!" The band also forms several iconic images during its pre-game show including the [[#Flying WV|Flying WV]], WVU, expanding circles, and an outline of the state of [[West Virginia]]. Each season's pre-game show is similar but unique. 

It is one of the few college marching band to include a male baton twirler.<ref>[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4324/ WVU news release] on Mountaineer Band twirlers</ref>

In 1997, the WVU Band was awarded the [[Sudler Trophy]] by the [[John Philip Sousa Foundation]].

===Fight song===
"Hail, West Virginia" is the university fight song.  It was composed by WVU alumni Earl Miller and Ed McWhorter in 1915.  The lyrics were written by Fred B. Deem, who later became a lawyer in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]]. The Mountaineer Marching Band performs the second verse of "Hail, West Virginia" as part of its pre-game performance at [[West Virginia Mountaineers|Mountaineer]] football games.

===Carpet roll===
In 1955, Fred Schaus and Alex Mumford devised the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for Mountaineer basketball players to run out on during pre-game warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue painted basketball. The university West continued this tradition until the late 1960s. Former Mountaineer player [[Gale Catlett]] reintroduced the carpet when he returned to West Virginia in 1978 as head men's basketball coach.
