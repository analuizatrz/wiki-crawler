'''Lewis Carl Hamilton''' (born [[January 7]] [[1985]] in Tewin, [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] Formula One [[racing driver]]. As of the [[2007 Formula One season]] he drives for the [[McLaren]] team. He made his [[F1]] début at the [[Australian Grand Prix]] on [[18th March]], [[2007]], finishing 3rd.

==Personal and early life==
Hamilton's [[paternal]] grandparents emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] from the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Grenada]] in the 1950s. He was educated at [[The John Henry Newman School]]. His grandfather worked on the London underground.<ref>{{cite news |title=Grenadian roots of first black F1 driver |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2006/11/061127_grenadaf1.shtml |date=[[2006-11-27]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> In early 2007, Hamilton moved from [[Tewin|Tewin Wood]], [[Hertfordshire]] to [[Woking]] in [[Surrey]] in order to be closer to the [[Mclaren F1|McLaren]] factory. The Daily Mirror reported in March 2007 that he was dating Jodia Ma.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hamilton in love with college girl|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]] |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_method=full%26objectid=18768228%26siteid=89520-name_page.html}}</ref> His father, Anthony, attends all of Lewis's races. He bought Lewis his first go-kart because Lewis was a hyperactive child.

==Racing career==
===Pre-Formula One===
[[Image:Mercedes_DTM_AMG_Hamilton.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lewis Hamilton in a Mercedes-Benz CLK DTM.]]
====Karting====
Hamilton began karting in 1993 at the age of eight<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio"> {{cite web | title = Who's Who: Lewis Hamilton | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2006 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/whos-who/whos-who-h/lewis-hamilton/ | accessdate =2006-12-02}}</ref>, and quickly began winning races and championships.

He progressed through the Cadet (1995-6), Junior Yamaha (1997), Junior Intercontinental A (1998-9), Intercontinental A (1999) and Formula A (2000) ranks in six seasons. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers’ Club made him a ‘Rising Star’ Member in 2000<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />.

====Junior Formulas====

Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth overall<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />. This led to a full 2002 [[Formula Renault#United Kingdom|Formula Renault UK]] campaign with Manor Motorsport. Hamilton finished third overall with three wins and three pole positions <ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />. He remained with Manor for another year and won the championship convincingly with ten wins, beating Alex Lloyd with 419 points to 377<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />. But his debut appearance in British Formula Three was less successful – Hamilton crashed out of both races at the Brands Hatch season finale, being taken to hospital after the second<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />. He did show his speed at both the Macau and Korean Grand Prix. In the latter he qualified on pole position in his first visit to the Korean track and in only his fourth race outing in a f3 car.

Hamilton and Manor then made their debut in the [[2004]] [[Formula Three Euroseries]]. They won just one race and Hamilton was fifth in the championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix, race one of the Macau F3 Grand Prix, and had his first test in a McLaren F1 car in December<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" /> that year. He defected to reigning Euroseries champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds. He also won the [[Ultimate Masters of Formula 3]] at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]] <ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />.

After the season, British magazine ''[[Autosport]]'' featured him in their “Top 50 Drivers of 2005” issue, ranking Hamilton 24th<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />. This success led him to join [[ART Grand Prix]] for the [[2006 GP2 Series season]]. Like ASM in F3, ART were the class of the field and reigning champions having taken the 2005 GP2 crown with [[Nico Rosberg]] <ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />.

Despite stiff opposition from rivals who had raced in the GP2 series during 2005, such as team mate [[Alexandre Prémat]] and [[Nelson Angelo Piquet]], Lewis duly won the GP2 championship at his first attempt. Among his notable performances was a dominant win at the fifth round held at the Nurburgring, which he won after serving a penalty for speeding in the pits.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

At his home race at [[Silverstone]], supporting the [[British Grand Prix]], he impressed again by overtaking two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed (up to 150 mph in a GP2 car) bends where overtaking is rare. He demonstrated his overtaking prowess again at the race in Istanbul, although he failed to win on that occasion. He became GP2 champion in unusual circumstances. [[Giorgio Pantano]] won the penultimate race at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], and set the fastest lap on the final lap, initially taking this bonus point from Hamilton. However, it transpired that he had set this under a yellow flag, indicating to the officials that he had not slowed enough to avoid potential danger, leading to him losing the fastest lap, which instead gave Hamilton the single point he needed to clinch the title.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

====2007 Onward: Formula 1====
{{mainarticle|McLaren}}
As early as 1994 Hamilton had introduced himself to [[McLaren]] team boss [[Ron Dennis]], at that Year's [[Autosport]] Awards<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />, asking if he could drive for the team in the future.

In 1998 he was signed to the McLaren Driver Development Support programme. The contract included a future option on an F1 seat making Hamilton, 13 at the time, the youngest driver ever to have an F1 contract.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

His 2006 GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] to [[NASCAR]] and [[Kimi Räikkönen]] to [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

After a long period of speculation of whether he, [[Pedro de la Rosa]], [[Gary Paffett]], or even [[Mika Häkkinen]] would drive for McLaren alongside World Champion [[Fernando Alonso]] for the [[2007 Formula One season]], Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.<ref>{{cite news| title = Lewis Hamilton joins Formula 1 World Champion Fernando Alonso at Vodafone McLaren Mercedes| publisher = mclaren.com| url = http://www.mclaren.com/mediaroom/information/pressreleases/lewis_hamilton.php| date = [[2006-11-24]]| accessdate = 2006-11-24}}</ref> He was told of McLaren’s decision on September 30th, but the news was not made public until November 24th, for fear that it would be overshadowed by [[Michael Schumacher]]’s retirement announcement.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

Hamilton is the first driver with prominent African or Caribbean ancestry to compete in Formula One,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/motor_racing/article2013302.ece |title= Hamilton's F1 drive is a dream come true |author=David Tremayne |date=[[2006-11-25]] |accessdate=2006-11-25 |publisher=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> although [[Willy T. Ribbs]] tested a Formula One car over 20 years ago.<ref>{{cite web | title = First black Formula One driver... | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2006 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2006/09/14/first-black-formula-one-driver/ | accessdate =2006-12-02}}</ref>Hamilton started testing for [[McLaren]] in Spain in November 2006, and was occasionally quicker than [[Pedro De La Rosa]] and the rest of the field.

On his debut at the [[2007 Australian Grand Prix]], he qualified 4th on the grid and finished 3rd in the race. This made him the 13th driver to finish on the podium in his Grand Prix debut<ref>{{cite web | title = Hamilton makes history | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2007 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/03/18/hamilton-makes-history/ | accessdate = 2007-03-22}}</ref> (excluding those in the first ever World Championship round), the last being {{F1|1997}} World Champion [[Jacques Villeneuve]] eleven years earlier.
