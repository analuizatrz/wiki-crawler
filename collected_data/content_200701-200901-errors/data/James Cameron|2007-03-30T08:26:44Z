'''James Francis Cameron''' (born [[August 16]], [[1954]]) is a hugely successful three-time [[Academy Award]] winning [[film director|director]], [[Film producer|producer]] and [[screenwriter]]. He is noted for his [[action film|action]]/[[science fiction film|science fiction]] films, which are often highly successful financially and innovatively. Thematically, James Cameron's films generally explore the relationship between [[human|man]] and [[technology]]. Cameron also directed the film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which went on to become the top-grossing film of all time, with a worldwide gross of over [[United States dollar|US$]]1.8 billion; he also created ''[[The Terminator]]'' franchise.

== Background ==
James Cameron was born in [[Kapuskasing, Ontario|Kapuskasing]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], to Phillip, an [[electrical engineer]], and Shirley Cameron, an [[artist]]. He grew up in [[Chippawa, Ontario]], and in 1971 his family moved to [[Brea, California]]. There he studied [[physics]] at [[California State University, Fullerton|Cal State-Fullerton]], but his passion for [[filmmaking]] would draw him to the film archive of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] at every opportunity. After seeing the film ''[[Star Wars]]'', Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry. <ref>''The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars'', 2004 </ref>

== Early career ==
He started in the film industry as a screenwriter, then moved into art direction and effects for films such as ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' and ''[[Escape from New York]]''. Working with producer [[Roger Corman]], Cameron landed his first directorial job in [[1981 in film|1981]] for the film ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'', shot at Grand Cayman Island for the underwater diving sequences, and in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] for most of the interior scenes. He was originally hired as the special effects director (and his hand in story-writing can be suspected under the H. A. Milton pseudonym on the original script), and took over the direction when the original director left.

== Major films ==
=== ''The Terminator'' ===
During his stay in Rome, he fell ill and had a nightmare about a machine emerging from the fire, which had been sent from the future to kill him. While recovering, Cameron materialized the idea for ''[[The Terminator]]''. He finally completed a screenplay, and decided to sell it so that he could direct the movie. However, the production companies he contacted, while expressing interest in the project, were unwilling to let a first-time director make the movie. Finally, Cameron found a company called Hemdale Pictures, which was willing to let him direct. His soon-to-be-then-wife, [[Gale Anne Hurd]], who had started her own production company, [[Pacific Western Productions]], had previously worked with Cameron in Roger Corman's company and agreed to buy Cameron's screenplay for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. Hurd was signed on as producer, and Cameron finally got his first break as director. [[Orion Pictures]] would distribute the film.

Initially, for the role of the Terminator, Cameron wanted someone who wasn't exceptionally muscular, and who could "blend into" a normal crowd. [[Lance Henriksen]], who had starred in ''Piranha II: The Spawning'', was considered for the titular role, but when [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Cameron first met over lunch to discuss Schwarzenegger playing the role of [[Kyle Reese]], both came to the conclusion that the cyborg villain would be the more compelling role for the Austrian bodybuilder; Henriksen got the smaller part of [[LAPD]] detective [[Hal Vukovich]] and the role of Kyle Reese went to [[Michael Biehn]]. In addition, [[Linda Hamilton]] first appeared in this film in her iconic role of [[Sarah Connor (fictional character)|Sarah Connor]], and later married Cameron.

''[[The Terminator]]'' was a box office hit, breaking expectations by Orion Pictures executives that the film would be regarded as no more than a sci-fi film, and only last a week in theaters. The film was low-budget ($6.5 million), but it earned over $38 million domestically.

=== ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' ===
During the early [[1980s]], Cameron wrote three screenplays simultaneously: ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Aliens (1986 film)|Aliens]]'', and the first draft of ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. While Cameron would continue with ''The Terminator'' and with ''Aliens,'' [[Sylvester Stallone]] eventually took over the script of ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', creating a final draft which differed radically from Cameron's initial version.<ref>http://www.amazingcameron.com/biography.html</ref>

=== ''Aliens'' ===
Cameron next began the sequel to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', the 1979 film by [[Ridley Scott]]. Cameron would name the sequel ''[[Aliens (1986 film)|Aliens]]'', and would again cast [[Sigourney Weaver]] in the iconic role of [[Ellen Ripley]] (the sole survivor from the first film). ''Aliens'' became a box office success, and Sigourney Weaver received a nomination for ''Best Actress'' during the 1986 [[Academy Awards]]. In addition, the film and its lead actress made the cover of [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] as a result of its breakthrough feminist themes about women in combat. Following the phenomenal hit of the film, Cameron now had more freedom to make whatever project he wanted.

=== ''The Abyss'' ===
Cameron's next project stemmed from an idea that had come up during a high school biology class. The story of oil-rig workers who discover otherworldly underwater creatures became the basis of Cameron's screenplay for ''[[The Abyss]]'', which cast [[Ed Harris]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]]. Made on a budget of about $41 million U.S.<ref>Paula Parisi, ''Titanic and the Making of James Cameron,'' 1998, pg. 19</ref>, it was considered to be one of the most expensive films of its time, and required cutting-edge effects technology. Because much of the film takes place underwater and the technology wasn't advanced enough to digitally create an underwater environment, Cameron chose to shoot much of the movie "reel-for-real," at depths of up to 40 feet. For creation of the sets, an unfinished nuclear power plant was converted, and two huge tanks were utilized. The main tank was filled with 7.5 million gallons of water, and the second 2.5 million gallons. There, the cast and crew would reside for much of the shooting.

''The Abyss'' opened on [[August 9]], [[1989]] and held the number-one slot at the box office for two weeks<ref>Paula Parisi ''Titanic and the Making of James Cameron, 1998, pg. 167</ref>. It ultimately earned $85.2 million domestically, $46 million in foreign markets<ref>Paula Parisi, ''Titanic and the Making of James Cameron, 1998, pg. 224</ref> and a mostly lukewarm response from critics. Cameron would later release a special edition version of the film in spring of 1993, restoring deleted scenes, including the film's climax as it had been originally conceived. The film was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]]; ''[[Best Visual Effects]], [[Best Art Direction]], [[Best Cinematography]]'', and ''[[Best Sound]].'' It won for ''Best Visual Effects''. After the release of ''The Abyss'', Cameron founded his own production company called ''Lightstorm Entertainment'', which produced all of his subsequent films.

=== ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' ===
After the success of ''The Terminator'', there had always been talks about a sequel to continue the story of Sarah Connor and her struggle against machines from the future. Although Cameron had come up with a core idea for the sequel, and Schwarzenegger expressed interest in continuing the story, there were still problems regarding who had the rights to the story, as well as the logistics of the special effects needed to make the sequel. Finally, in mid-1990, [[Mario Kassar]] of [[Carolco Pictures]] secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to greenlight production of the film, now called ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.

For the film, [[Linda Hamilton]] reprised her iconic role of [[Sarah Connor (fictional character)|Sarah Connor]].<ref>http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,314767_7%7C14651%7C%7C0_0_,00.html</ref> In addition, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] also returned in his role as The Terminator, called the [[Cyberdyne Systems Model 101]], but this time as a protector. Unlike the Model 101, who is made of a metal endoskeleton, the new villain of the sequel, called the [[T-1000]], was a more advanced Terminator made of liquid metal, and with polymorphic abilities. The T-1000 would also be much less bulky than the Model 101. For the role, Cameron cast [[Robert Patrick]], who was a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained, "I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the T-800 is a human Panzer tank, then the T-1000 is a Porsche."

Cameron had originally wanted to incorporate this advanced-model Terminator into the first film, but unfortunately the special effects at the time were not advanced enough. The ground-breaking effects used in ''The Abyss'' to digitally realize the water tentacle convinced Cameron that his liquid metal villain was now possible.

[[TriStar Pictures]] would distribute the film under a locked release date that was only about half a year away from when shooting would begin. The movie, which was co-written by Cameron and his longtime friend, [[William Wisher, Jr.]], had to go from screenplay to finished film in just that amount of time. Like Cameron's previous film, it was one of the most expensive films of its era, with a budget of about $100 million. The biggest challenge of the movie was the special effects used in creating the T-1000. Nevertheless, the film was finished on time, and released to theaters on [[July 3]], [[1991]].

''Terminator 2'', or ''T2'', as it was abbreviated, broke box-office records (including the opening weekend record for an R-rated film), earning over $200 million domestically, and over $300 million overseas, and became the highest-grossing film of that year. It won four [[Academy Awards]]: Best Makeup, Best Sound, Best Sound Effects, and Best Visual Effects.

=== ''True Lies'' ===
Before the release of ''T2'', Schwarzenegger came to Cameron with the idea of making a remake of the French comedy titled ''[[La Totale]]''. Titled ''[[True Lies]]'', with filming begun after ''T2'''s release, the story revolves around a secret-agent spy who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman. Schwarzenegger would be cast as the secret spy, named Harry Tasker, whose mission in the movie is to investigate and stop a plan by Arab [[terrorists]] to use [[nuclear weapons]] against the United States. [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] would play Schwarzenegger's onscreen wife, with [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] cast as the secret agent's sidekick.

Cameron's ''Lightstorm Entertainment'' signed on with Twentieth Century Fox for production of ''[[True Lies]]''. Made on a budget of $115 million and released in 1994, the film earned $146 million in North America, and $232 million abroad.

=== ''Titanic'' ===
Cameron expressed interest in the famous sinking of the ship ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''. He decided to script and film his next project based on this event. The picture revolved around a fictional romance story between two young lovers from different social classes who meet onboard the ship's maiden, and final, voyage. Before production began, he took dives to the bottom of the Atlantic and shot actual footage of the ship underwater, which he would insert into the final film.

For the film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', Cameron cast [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Kate Winslet]], and [[Billy Zane]]. Cameron's budget for the film reached about $200 million, and it became the most expensive movie ever made. Before its release, the film was widely ridiculed for its expense and protracted production schedule.

Released to theaters on [[December 19]], [[1997]], ''Titanic'' opened with $28 million on its first weekend. The film's grosses escalated in the next several weeks. ''Titanic'' was one of very few modern movies to gross more in their second weekend than their first. Its gross increased from $28.6 million to $35.4 million from week 1 to week 2, an increase of 23.8%, unheard of for a wide release, and a testament to the appeal of the movie. This was especially noteworthy, considering that the film's running time of more than three hours limited the number of showings each theater could schedule. It held the #1 spot on the box-office charts for months, eventually grossing a total of over $600 million domestically and more than $1.2 billion outside North America. ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' became the highest grossing film of all time. (Adjusting for inflation, the film brought in the fifth-highest domestic (U.S. only) gross of all time.) <ref>http://www.boxofficereport.com/atbon/adjusted.shtml</ref> The CG visuals surrounding the sinking and destruction of the ship were considered spectacular. During the 1998 Academy Awards, the film won a record-tying 11 Oscars. Among them were Best Picture and Best Director.

=== ''Dark Angel'' ===
Cameron had initially next planned to do a film of the comic book character ''[[Spider-Man]]'', a project developed by [[Menahem Golan]] of [[Cannon Films]]. Disputes arose focusing on Golan's role in the Carolco project. A screenplay dating back to 1989 exists with Cameron's name appended to it, indicating he worked with a series of writers on the project (John Brancato, Barry [sic: Barney] Cohen, Joseph Goldmari [sic: "Joseph Goldman" is Menahem Golan's pen name] and [[Ted Newsom]]), but the script was identical to one presented to Columbia Pictures by Golan in 1988, where the project had been in development. Subsequently, Cameron presented a 45-page ''Spider-Man'' screen story to Carolco, which bore substantive similarities to a number of earlier screenplay drafts, particularly one written by Ethan Wiley (writer of the film ''[[House (film)|House]]'' and writer/director of ''[[House 2]]''). When Carolco went into bankruptcy, the "Cameron material" (''i.e.'', both the multi-author screenplay and the later treatment credited solely to Cameron) was acquired by MGM. MGM in turn sold them to Columbia Pictures in exchange for Columbia dropping their plans to do an alternative [[James Bond]] series based on the [[Kevin McClory]] Bond material. Columbia hired [[David Koepp]] to adapt Cameron's treatment into a screenplay, and Koepp's first draft is taken often word-for-word from Cameron's story, though it was heavily rewritten by Koepp himself, Scott Rosenberg, [[Alvin Sargent]] (husband of producer [[Laura Ziskin]]), and (allegedly) [[Ivan Raimi]], brother of director [[Sam Raimi]]. Columbia preferred to credit David Koepp solely, and none of the various scripts were ever examined by the [[Writers Guild of America]] to determine proper credits. Cameron objected, as did a number of the other writers, but Columbia and the WGA prevailed. The Columbia screenplay was credited solely to Koepp.<ref>http://www.hollywood.com/news/detail/id/311891</ref>

Cameron instead moved on to television, and created the story of a new [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroine]], which was influenced by [[cyberpunk]], current superhero genres, and [[third-wave feminism]]:

: ''After the [[Sarah Connor (fictional character)|Sarah Connors]] and [[Ellen Ripley]]s of the [[1980s|eighties]], the [[1990s|nineties]] weren't so kind to the superwoman format &mdash; [[Xena]] Warrior Princess excepted. But it's a new millennium now, and while [[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]] and [[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]] are kicking up a storm on movie screens, it's been down to James Cameron to bring empowered female warriors back to television screens. And tellingly, Cameron has done it by mixing the sober feminism of his [[The Terminator|Terminator]] and [[Aliens (1986 film)|Aliens]] characters with the sexed-up [[Girl Power]] of a [[Britney Spears]] concert. The result is [[Dark Angel (TV Series)|Dark Angel]]''.<ref>http://www.darkangelfan.com/news/254.shtml</ref>

Co-produced with [[Charles H. Eglee]], ''[[Dark Angel (TV Series)|Dark Angel]]'' starred [[Jessica Alba]] as Max Guevera/X5-452, a [[genetic engineering|genetically enhanced]] [[transgenics|transgenic]] super-soldier created by the super-secretive Manticore organization. It also starred [[Michael Weatherly]] as Logan Cale, and noted actor [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] (of ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'') as Colonel Donald Michael Lydecker. While a success in its first season, low ratings in the second led to its cancellation. Cameron himself directed the series finale, a two-hour episode wrapping up many of the series' loose ends.

=== Current projects ===
Cameron's recent projects have included undersea documentaries on the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] (''[[Expedition: Bismarck]]'', 2002) and the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] (''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' (2003, in IMAX 3D), and ''[[Tony Robinson]]'s Titanic Adventure'' (2005)<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497987/ ''Titanic Adventure'' (2005) (TV)] at [[IMDb]]</ref>). He was a producer on the 2002 film ''[[Solaris (2002 film)|Solaris]]'', and narrated ''[[The Exodus Decoded]]''.

Cameron is a leading advocate for [[stereoscopic]] [[digital]] [[3-D film|3-D]] films. ''Ghosts of the Abyss'' was shot in 3-D, as will his next projects, ''[[Avatar (film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[The Dive]]'' and an adaptation of the [[manga]] series ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]''.

''Avatar'', previously known as ''Project 880'', has an estimated budget of $200 million, is currently in pre-production for a mid-2009 release, and will mark his first feature film since 1997's ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2007-01-10/#2| title = Cameron To Direct First Movie in 10 Years| accessdate = 2007-01-10 | date = 2007-01-10| publisher = [[IMDb]]}}</ref> It will be almost entirely composed of computer-generated animation, using a more advanced version of the "[[performance capture]]" technique used by director [[Robert Zemeckis]] in ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Harry Knowles | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/31191 | title=Harry interviews James Cameron regarding AVATAR - No, Not that one, The One You're Dying To See! - Part 1! | publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] | date=[[2007-01-09]] | accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref> Cameron sees ''Battle Angel Alita'' as a "three film cycle".<ref>{{cite news | author=Harry Knowles | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=22599 | title=Harry talks to James Cameron, Cracks PROJECT 880, the BATTLE ANGEL trilogy & Cameron's live shoot on Mars!!! | publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] | date=[[2006-02-28]] | accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref>

He is also co-rewriting the screenplay for a high-definition 3-D live-action deep-sea-diving drama entitled ''[[James Cameron's Sanctum]]'', to be produced by himself and directed by [[Gary Johnstone]]. ''Sanctum'' will have a relatively-low starting budget of about $20 million.

In addition, he plans to create a 3-D project about the first trip to [[Mars]]. ("I've been very interested in the Humans to Mars movement &mdash; the 'Mars Underground' &mdash; and I've done a tremendous amount of personal research for a novel, a miniseries, and a 3-D film.")<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.astrobio.net/news/article813.html| title=James Cameron's Mars Reference Design| publisher=''[[Astrobiology Magazine]]'' | date=[[2004-01-30]] | accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref> He is on the science team for the 2009 [[Mars Science Laboratory]].<ref>http://www.msss.com/msl/team.html</ref>

Cameron announced on [[February 26]], [[2007]], that he, along with his director, [[Simcha Jacobovici]], have documented the unearthing of the [[Talpiot Tomb]], which is alleged to be the tomb of [[Jesus]]. Unearthed in 1980 by Israeli construction workers, the names on the tomb are claimed, by Cameron, to correlate with the names of Jesus and several individuals closely associated with him. Cameron further claims to have DNA tests, archaeological evidence, and Biblical studies to back up his claim. <ref>{{cite web| url= http://time-blog.com/middle_east/2007/02/jesus_tales_from_the_crypt.html| title=Jesus : Tales From The Crypt| publisher=''[[Time Middle East Blog]]'' | date=[[2007-02-24]] | accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> The documentary, named ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'', was broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] on [[March 4]], [[2007]]

== Awards ==
Cameron received the [[Nebula Award#Other Nebula Ceremony Awards|Bradbury Award]] from the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] in 1991 &mdash; but, being primarily thought of as a genre filmmaker, he did not receive any major mainstream filmmaking awards prior to [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']]. With ''Titanic'', Cameron received the [[Academy Award]]s for Best Editing (shared with [[Conrad Buff IV]] and [[Richard A. Harris]]), Best Picture (shared with [[John Landau]]), and Best Director.

In recognition of his contributions to underwater filming and remote vehicle technology, the [[University of Southampton]] awarded Cameron the [[honorary degree]] of Doctor of the University. Cameron received his degree in person at the [[graduation]] ceremony in July, 2004.

== Recurring cast members ==
Cameron often casts certain actors more than once in his films. Cameron has mostly worked with [[Bill Paxton]] in ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Aliens (1986 film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[True Lies]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]''. [[Michael Biehn]] was also in ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Aliens (1986 movie)|Aliens]]'', ''[[The Abyss]]'' and a deleted scene from ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''. [[Lance Henriksen]] appeared in ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Aliens (1986 movie)|Aliens]]'', and narrated ''[[Expedition: Bismarck]]''. [[Jenette Goldstein]] appeared in ''[[Aliens (1986 movie)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. In addition to starring in the ''Terminator'' films, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] also starred in ''[[True Lies]]''. In February 2007 [[Sigourney Weaver]] was cast for Cameron's upcoming film ''[[Avatar (film)|Avatar]]'' after having worked with him on ''[[Aliens (1986 film)|Aliens]]'' as lead actress.

He also wrote early drafts of ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and had input into ''[[Alien Nation]]''. He is also credited with giving the ''Predator'' character the [[dreadlock]]-look, after sharing ideas with Stan Winston. His screenplay for ''A Crowded Room'', a thriller about a person suffering from [[Dissociative identity disorder|DID]], eventually became a casualty of the long pre-production nightmare. A heavily-rewritten screenplay to ''[[The Crowded Room]]'' is currently being produced under the direction of [[Joel Schumacher]].
