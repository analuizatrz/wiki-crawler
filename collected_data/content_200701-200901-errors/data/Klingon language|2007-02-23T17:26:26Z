The '''Klingon language''' ('''''tlhIngan Hol''''' in Klingon) is the [[constructed language]] spoken by [[Klingon]]s in the fictional [[Star Trek]] universe.  Deliberately designed by [[Marc Okrand]] to be "alien", it contains many peculiarities, such as [[Object Verb Subject]] (OVS) word order. The basic sound (along with a very few words) was first devised by [[James Doohan]] for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. That film marked the first time the language had been heard on screen, all previous appearances of the Klingons being in English. Klingon was subsequently developed by Okrand into a fully fledged language.

Klingon is sometimes referred to as Klingonese (most notably in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]", where it was actually pronounced by Korax as "Klingonee"), but among the Klingon-speaking community this is often understood to refer to another Klingon language that is described in [[John M. Ford]]'s Star Trek novels as [[Klingonaase]].

A small number of people, mostly dedicated [[Trekkie|Star Trek fans]] or [[list of linguists|language aficionados]], can converse in Klingon.  However, its vocabulary, heavily centered on Star Trek or 'Klingon' concepts such as "[[Klingon starships|spacecraft]]" or "[[weapons of Star Trek|warfare]]", makes it impractical for everyday use.

== History ==
Though mentioned in the original ''Star Trek'' series, Klingon was first used on-screen in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979); for ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' (1984), Okrand enlarged the lexicon and developed grammar around the original dozen words Doohan had created.  It would be used intermittently in later movies featuring the original cast: in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991), [[translation]] difficulties would serve as a [[plot device]].

With the advent of the series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1987) – in which one of the main characters was a Klingon, [[Worf]] – and successors, the language and various cultural aspects for the fictional species were expatiated.  Worf would later reappear among the regular characters in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1992) and [[B'Elanna Torres]], a Klingon-human [[hybrid]], would become a main character on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' (1995).  Later in the pilot episode of the [[prequel]] ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', "[[Broken Bow (Enterprise episode)|Broken Bow]]" (2001), the Klingon language is described as having "eighty polyguttural [[dialect]]s constructed on an adaptive [[syntax]]"; however, Klingon as described on television is often [[Star Trek canon#Klingon language|not entirely congruous]] with Klingon developed by Okrand.

== Language ==
The Klingon language has a following and numerous reference works.  A description of the actual Klingon language can be found in Okrand's book <cite>[[The Klingon Dictionary]]</cite> (Published by Pocket Books, Simon & Schuster, 1985, second edition with new addendum 1992, ISBN 0-671-74559-X). Other notable works include <cite>The Klingon Way</cite> (with Klingon sayings and proverbs), <cite>Klingon for the Galactic Traveler</cite> and the two audio productions <cite>Conversational Klingon</cite> and <cite>Power Klingon</cite>.

Three books have also been published in the tongue:  <cite>[[ghIlghameS]]</cite> (<cite>[[Gilgamesh]]</cite>), ''[[The Klingon Hamlet|Hamlet]]'' (<cite>[[Hamlet]]</cite>), and <cite>paghmo' tIn mIS</cite> (<cite>[[Much Ado About Nothing]]</cite>).  These last two choices were inspired by a remark from High Chancellor Gorkon in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' that [[Shakespeare]] is best read in the original Klingon.

[[Image:Qapla'.svg|thumb|Qapla']]Some [[Trekkie]]s take the time to learn it and at some [[Star Trek convention]]s one can hear enthusiasts use it amongst themselves. They often greet each other with the Klingon word ''nuqneH'' (literally: "What do you want?"), though this contraction is actually a response to a greeting. Another phrase commonly heard among Star Trek fans is "''<nowiki>Qapla'</nowiki>''", the Klingon word for "success".

[[Paramount Pictures]] owns a [[copyright]] to the official dictionary and other [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] descriptions of the language. Some people dispute the validity of Paramount's claim of copyright on the language itself in light of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court's]] ''[[Feist v. Rural|Feist]]'' decision<ref>{{cite web | url=http://importance.corante.com/archives/002300.html | title=Klingon is Copyrighted | author=Ernest Miller | work=The Importance of... | year=March 08 2004 }}</ref>, but no challenge has actually been brought to court.

It is commonly postulated that features of the Klingon language were taken from various real Earth languages which Okrand has studied, particularly [[Native American languages]]. It is known however, that a design principle of the Klingon language was dissimilarity to existing natural languages.

According to [[Guinness World Records]] for 2006, it is the most spoken fictional language by number of speakers.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

== Canon ==
An important concept to spoken and written Klingon is canonicity. Only words and grammatical forms introduced by Marc Okrand are considered proper, canonical Klingon.

It is a zone of contention among Klingonists as to what level of neologism is permissable.<ref>[www.angelfire.com/trek/yensw/PDF/thesis.pdf Klingon as Linguistic Capital, Yens Wahlgren, June 2000]</ref>

== Notable Speakers ==
Some Klingonists have gained relative notoriety for various accomplishments. The [[Klingon Language Institute]] can award the title ''Friend of Maltz'' to a Klingonist who has furthered the language in various ways.   

=== d'Armond Speers ===

Dr. d'Armond Speers is an American computational linguist and a member of the KLI. 

He graduated from [[Georgetown University]] in the Spring of 2002. His dissertation topic was "Representation of American Sign Language for Machine Translation." <ref>[http://higbee.cots.net/Holtej//lx.htm d'Armond Speers homepage]</ref>

Dr. Speers is known for having undertaken the endeavour to raise his child bilingually in [[English language|English]] and Klingon; Speers spoke in Klingon and his wife in [[English language|English]]. A few years into his life, the child began rejecting Klingon and gravitating towards English, as he could use English with many more speakers. The fact that Klingon lacked many words for things that were important in a baby's life, such as "diaper" (nappy), and "pacifier" (dummy), was a lesser issue. At the time of Speers' attempt, Klingon even lacked words for many objects common around the house, such as "table". The experiment ultimately failed when the child refused to use Klingon when he got older. <ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.08/mustread.html?pg=8 Gavin Edwards: ''Babble On Revisited'', Wired Magazine, Issue 7.08, August 1999]</ref>

=== Lawrence Schoen ===

Dr. Lawrence Schoen is the founder and current director of the KLI. 

He obtained a master's degree in psycholinguistics from California State University of Northridge, and then a doctorate from Kansas State University. He has served as a faculty member at various institutions, and now writes science-fiction.

He resides in Flourtown Pennsylvania USA, the international headquarters of the KLI.

== Phonology ==
Klingon has been developed with a [[phonology]] that, while based on human [[natural languages]], is intended to sound [[alien language|alien]].  When initially developed, Paramount Pictures (owners of the Star Trek [[media franchise|franchise]]) wanted the Klingon language to be guttural and harsh and Okrand wanted it to be unusual, so he selected [[articulatory phonetics|sounds]] that combined in ways not generally found in other languages.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The effect is mainly achieved by the use of a number of [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] consonants in the language's inventory. Although natural languages use a number of different [[airstream mechanism]]s besides the common [[pulmonic egressive]], these other mechanisms are not used in Klingon. This is perhaps because these sounds are a lot more difficult to learn to produce if one's language does not use them. Klingon has twenty-one consonants (the list below shows twenty-two - the '&lt;D&gt;' has two similar sounds) and five [[cardinal vowels]]. Klingon is normally written in a variant of the [[Latin alphabet]] (see [[#Writing system|below]]). In this orthography, [[upper case|upper]] and [[lower case]] letters are not interchangeable (uppercase letters mostly represent sounds different to those expected by English speakers). In the discussion below, standard Klingon orthography appears in ''&lt;angle brackets&gt;'', and the [[phoneme|phonemic transcription]] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is written between ''/slashes/''.

===Consonants===
The inventory of consonants in Klingon is spread over a number of [[place of articulation|places of articulation]]. In spite of this, the inventory has many gaps: Klingon has no [[velar consonant|velar plosives]], and only one [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]]. Deliberately, this arrangement is quite bizarre by the standards of human languages. The combination of aspirated [[voiceless alveolar plosive]] {{IPA|/tʰ/}} and [[voiced retroflex plosive]] {{IPA|/ɖ/}} is particularly unusual, for example.

;[[Labial consonant|Labials]]
:&lt;p&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/pʰ/}} &mdash; [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] [[voiceless bilabial plosive]] (as [[English language|English]] ''pan'', but accompanied by puff of air not only in word initial positions, but in all positions)
:&lt;b&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/b/}} &mdash; [[voiced bilabial plosive]] (as English ''ban'')
:&lt;m&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/m/}} &mdash; [[bilabial nasal]] (as English ''man'')
:&lt;v&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/v/}} &mdash; [[voiced labiodental fricative]] (as English ''van'')
;[[Coronal consonant|Coronals]]
:&lt;t&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/tʰ/}} &mdash; [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] [[voiceless alveolar plosive]] (as English ''tan'', but accompanied by puff of air not only in word initial positions, but in all positions)
:&lt;D&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ɖ/}} &mdash; [[voiced retroflex plosive]] (as [[Swedish language|Standard Swedish]] ''nord'')
:&lt;n&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/n/}} &mdash; [[alveolar nasal]] (as English ''nan'') 
:&lt;n&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ɳ/}} &mdash; [[retroflex nasal]], an [[allophone]] of <D> (as Swedish ''Vänern'')  (Sometimes, <D> is rendered as /ɳɖ/)
:&lt;r&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/r/}} &mdash; [[alveolar trill]] (trilled as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''rojo'')
:&lt;r&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ɹ/}} &mdash; [[alveolar approximant]], an allophone of the trilled &lt;r&gt;
:&lt;r&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ɾ/}} &mdash; [[alveolar flap]], another allophone of the trilled &lt;r&gt;
:&lt;S&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ʂ/}} &mdash; [[voiceless retroflex fricative]] (as [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] ''Shànghǎi'')
:&lt;l&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/l/}} &mdash; [[alveolar lateral approximant]] (as English ''lung'', never [[velarization|velarized]] as English ''gull'')
;[[Dorsal consonant|Dorsals]]
:&lt;q&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/qʰ/}} &mdash; [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] [[voiceless uvular plosive]] (as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[Qur'an]]'', but aspirated)
:&lt;ng&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ŋ/}} &mdash; [[velar nasal]] (as English ''ring'')
:&lt;H&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/x/}} &mdash; [[voiceless velar fricative]] (as [[Scots language|Scots]] ''loch'')
:&lt;gh&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ɣ/}} &mdash; [[voiced velar fricative]] (as Arabic ''Baghdad'' or Spanish ''agua'')
:&lt;y&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/j/}} &mdash; [[palatal approximant]] (as English ''yes'')
:&lt;w&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/w/}} &mdash; [[labial-velar approximant]] (as English ''wash'')
;[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]
:&lt;'&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ʔ/}} &mdash; [[glottal stop]] (as between the vowels of ''uh-oh'' or the Arabic letter ''hamza'')
;[[Affricate consonant|Affricates]]
:&lt;ch&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ʧ/}} &mdash; [[voiceless postalveolar affricate]] (as English ''church'')
:&lt;j&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ʤ/}} &mdash; [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] (as English ''judge'')
:&lt;tlh&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/t͡ɬ/}} &mdash; [[voiceless alveolar lateral affricate]] (as [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] ''Nahuatl'')
:&lt;Q&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/q͡χ/}} &mdash; [[voiceless uvular affricate]] (occurs in [[Nez Percé language|Nez Percé]], [[Wolof language|Wolof]] and [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]])

===Vowels===
In contrast to consonants, Klingon's inventory of vowels is simple and similar to many human languages, such as Spanish. There are five vowels spaced evenly around the vowel space, with two back rounded vowels, and two front or near-front unrounded vowels — the most common for human languages. There is also a back unrounded vowel.

The two front vowels, &lt;e&gt; and &lt;I&gt;, represent sounds that are found in English but are more open and lax than a typical English speaker might assume when reading Klingon text written in the Latin alphabet, causing the consonants of a word to be more prominent. This enhances the sense that Klingon is a clipped and harsh-sounding language.

;[[Vowel]]s
:&lt;a&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ɑ/}} &mdash; [[open back unrounded vowel]] (in English ''spa'')
:&lt;e&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ɛ/}} &mdash; [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] (in English ''bed'')
:&lt;I&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/ɪ/}} &mdash; [[near-close near-front unrounded vowel]] (in English ''bit'')
:&lt;o&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/o/}} &mdash; [[close-mid back rounded vowel]] (in [[French language|French]] ''eau'')
:&lt;u&gt; &mdash; {{IPA|/u/}} &mdash; [[close back rounded vowel]] (in Spanish ''tu'')

[[Diphthong]]s can be analyzed phonetically as the combination of the five vowels plus one of the two [[semivowel]]s {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} (represented by &lt;w&gt; and &lt;y&gt;, respectively). Thus, the combinations &lt;ay&gt;, &lt;ey&gt;, &lt;Iy&gt;, &lt;oy&gt;, &lt;uy&gt;, &lt;aw&gt;, &lt;ew&gt; and &lt;Iw&gt; are possible. There are no words in the Klingon language that contain *&lt;ow&gt; or *&lt;uw&gt;.

====Vowel stress====
In verbs, the stressed syllable is usually the verb itself, as opposed to a prefix or any suffixes except when a suffix ending with ' is separated from the verb by at least one other suffix, in which case the suffix ending in ' is also stressed. In addition, stress may shift to a suffix which is meant to be emphasized.

In nouns, the final syllable of the stem (the noun itself, excluding any affixes) is stressed. If any syllables ending in ' are present, the stress shifts to those syllables.

The stress in other words seems to be variable, but this is not a serious issue because most of these words are only one syllable in length. Still, there are some words which should fall under the rules above, but do not, although using the standard rules would still be acceptable.

===Syllabification===
Klingon [[syllable]] structure is extremely strict: a syllable must start with a consonant (which includes the glottal stop) followed by one vowel. In prefixes and other more rare syllables, this is enough. More commonly, this consonant-vowel pair is followed by one consonant or one of three biconsonantal codas: /-'''''w' '''-'''y' '''-'''rgh'''''/. Thus, ''ta'' "record", ''tar'' "poison" and ''targh'' "targ" (a type of animal) are all legal syllable forms, but *''tarD'' and *''ar'' are not. Despite this, there is one suffix that takes the shape vowel+consonant: the endearment suffix -''oy''.

== Grammar ==
Klingon is an [[agglutinative]] language, using mainly affixes in order to alter the function or meaning of words. Some nouns have inherently plural forms: ''jengva&#39;'' "plate" vs. ''ngop'' "plates", for instance.

Klingon [[noun]]s take suffixes to indicate [[grammatical number]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], two levels of [[deixis]], possession and syntactic function. In all, 29 noun suffixes from five classes may be employed: ''jupoypu'na'wI'vaD'' "for my beloved true friends". Speakers are limited to no more than one suffix from each class to be added to a word, and the classes have a specific order of appearance.

Gender in Klingon does not indicate sex, as in English, or have an arbitrary assignment as in Danish or many other languages. It indicates whether a noun is a body part, a being capable of using language, or neither of these.

[[Verb]]s in Klingon are even more complex, taking a prefix indicating the number and person of the subject and object, plus suffixes from nine ordered classes, plus a special suffix class called ''rovers''. Each of the four known rovers has its own unique rule controlling its position among the suffixes in the verb. Verbs are marked for [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], certainty, predisposition and volition, dynamic, [[causative]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[negation]], and [[honorific]], and the Klingon verb has two moods: [[Grammatical mood|indicative]] and [[imperative]].

The most common [[word order]] in Klingon is [[Object Verb Subject]], and in some cases the word order is the exact reverse of word order in English:
 [[Image:Klingon sentence a.GIF|450px]]
 '''''DaH  mojaq-mey-vam  DI-vuS-nIS-be'           'e'   vI-Har'''''
 now  suffix<small>-PL-DEM   1PL.A.3PL.P-</small>limit-need<small>-NEG</small>  that <small>1SG.A.3SG.P-</small>believe
 "I believe that we do not need to limit these suffixes now."

Note that hyphens are used in the above only to illustrate the use of affixes. Hyphens are not used in Klingon.

Unlike most artificial [[auxiliary language]]s, which seek to either emulate elements of several evolved human languages in order to be easier to learn, or to be more regular with fewer exceptions than is the case in evolved existing languages, the Klingon language tries to break away from the most common features of other languages and embraces the exceptions to its own rules.

== Writing systems==
The official Klingon writing system is the [[Latin alphabet]] as used above, but on the television series, the Klingons use their own alien writing system. In ''The Klingon Dictionary'' this alphabet is named as ''pIqaD'', but no information is given about it. When Klingon symbols are used in Star Trek productions they are merely decorative graphic elements, designed to emulate real [[writing]] and create an appropriate atmosphere.

The Astra Image Corporation designed the symbols (currently used to "write" Klingon) for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', although these symbols are often incorrectly attributed to [[Michael Okuda]].<ref>Symbols attributed to Okuda: the Klingon Language Institute's ''Klingon FAQ'' (edited by [[d'Armond Speers]]), [http://web.archive.org/web/20041012093544/http://higbee.cots.net/~holtej/klingon/faq.htm#2.13  question 2.13] by Will Martin (August 18 1994). Symbols ''incorrectly'' attributed to Okuda: KLI founder Lawrence M. Schoen's [http://www.kli.org/pdf/Orthography.pdf "On Orthography" (PDF)], citing J. Lee's "An Interview with Michael Okuda" in the KLI's journal ''HolQed'' 1.1 (March 1992), p. 11. Symbols actually designed by Astra Image Corporation: Michael Everson's [[# note-2|Proposal....<sup>[3]</sup>]].</ref> They based the letters on the [[Klingon starships|Klingon battlecruiser]] hull markings (three letters) first created by [[Matt Jeffries]], and on [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] writing because the script had sharp letter forms &mdash; used as a testament to the Klingons' love for knives and blades. 

=== KLI pIqaD ===
[[Image:Kli piqad.GIF|thumb|The KLI pIqaD]]
[[Image:KLI_piqad_text_sample.GIF|thumb|KLI pIqaD text sample]]
Although the Latin alphabet is used officially to write Klingon, the speaking community also makes use of an artificial script designed to emulate Klingon writing on the show.  This alphabet was created by an anonymous source at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], who based their alphabet on letters seen in the show.  This "source" sent in their alphabet to the [[Klingon Language Institute]] and the KLI uploaded it onto their website as the Klingons' way of writing their language.  This alphabet has gained some acceptance within the speaker and fan community although many ''Klingonists'' still prefer the Latin alphabet.

The alphabet is quite simple:  It contains twenty-six letters with a one-to-one ''grapheme-phoneme correspondence'': that is, one letter represents one sound and one sound is written with one letter.  There are also ten numerals in the set.  It is written from left to right, top to bottom like English. There is no actual punctuation; however, those that use punctuation with the alphabet, use Skybox punctuation symbols (''see below''). 

In September 1997, [[Michael Everson]] made a proposal<ref>{{cite web | url=http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n1643/n1643.htm | title=Proposal to encode Klingon in Plane 1 of ISO/IEC 10646-2 | year=September 18 1997 | author=Michael Everson}}</ref> for encoding this in [[Unicode]]. The Unicode Technical Committee rejected the Klingon proposal in May 2001 on the grounds that research showed almost no use of the script for communication, and the vast majority of the people who did use Klingon employed the Latin alphabet by preference<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc-minutes/UTC-087-200105.html | title=Approved Minutes of the UTC 87 / L2 184 Joint Meeting | year=August 14, 2001 | author=The Unicode Consortium}}</ref>. Everson created a mapping of pIqaD into the [[Private Use Area]] of [[Unicode]], which he listed in the [[ConScript Unicode Registry]] (U+F8D0 to U+F8FF<ref>{{cite web | title=Klingon: U+F8D0 - U+F8FF | url=http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html | year=January 15 2004 | author=Michael Everson}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Test_Klingon.html | title=Comprehensive Unicode Test Page for Klingon | author=David Roger McCreedy | year=March 28 2005}}</ref>). Since then several fonts using that encoding have appeared, and software for typing in pIqaD has become available. As a result, blogs in pIqaD have begun to appear, raising the possibility of reapplying for inclusion in Unicode when there is a sufficient corpus. Existing text in [[Romanization]] can easily be converted to pIqaD also.

Michael Okuda, the long standing [[Star Trek]] scenic arts designer, and other Paramount staff have refused to have anything to do with the mapping.

=== Skybox pIqaD ===
[[Image:Klingonalphabet.GIF|thumb|The Klingon pIqaD according to Skybox]]
[[Image:Klingon-text-sample 2.JPG|thumb|A sample of written Klingon]]
The KLI pIqaD isn't the only mapping of Klingon letters.  The ''Astra Image'' letters were taken and used in the Paramount-endorsed [[Bitstream Inc|Bitstream]] font pack.  They were used to make a font with ten letters of the English alphabet: "e" to "n" being represented by the ten different klingon letters.  This font itself has been used by the ''Star Trek'' production team when creating Klingon graphics; however it is still used only as random gibberish on the shows.

The trading card company [[SkyBox International|Skybox]] used this font, when they created the Klingon language cards in their ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' trading card collection.  The Klingon cards themselves detail aspects of Klingon culture, and feature pIqaD text, and a transliteration and translation provided by Marc Okrand.  Some of these cards, notably  [http://qurgh.wizage.net/cards/S7.jpg S7], [http://qurgh.wizage.net/cards/S8.jpg S8] and  [http://qurgh.wizage.net/cards/S9.jpg card S9] feature pIqaD, which corresponds to the Latin transcription.
Other known cards include ''s19'' and ''s20'', the season seven card selection ''s37, s38 and s39'' (which featured no actual tlhIngan Hol, but only English and on card S39 Latin, written in the Skybox alphabet), and finally, the Checklist cards for each seasons' set of cards had the word ''cards'' written in Klingon on them when listing the above mentioned cards.

The script is written in horizontal lines running from left to right, top to bottom, just like English.  Klingon can be written with spaces between words (a word being defined as any noun, verb or leftover, plus any prefixes and suffixes attached to it) and [[punctuation]]. When this is the case, four punctuation marks are used:
* An "up-turned triangle" with a function similar to a [[full stop]], [[question mark]] or [[exclamation mark]].
* A "down-turned" triangle with a function similar to a [[comma]], [[semi-colon]] or [[colon (punctuation)|colon]].
* A mark similar in appearance to an [[hyphen]] (unknown function).
* A mark similar to an apostrophe (From KLI) (unknown)

The triangular punctuation marks have been accepted into the common usage of the KLI pIqaD (see above).

Klingon can also be written with no spaces or punctuation at all; this form is more common on the TV shows.  As in English, Klingon text can be left-justified, center-justified, or right-justified, and written in vertical columns on banners.

Due to its nature, the "Skybox" Alphabet is ill-suited to writing Klingon, in that ambiguity in the alphabet is apparent, so different words are spelled the same way: these are [[homograph]]s. The heartiest commendations and the gravest insults could be written identically, though it should be noted that context would go a long way to disambiguating homographs.

=== Mandel script ===
[[Image:Klinzhai alphabet.GIF|thumb|The Klinzhai alphabet]]
A third script, known as the Klinzhai or Mandel script, was included in ''The U.S.S. Enterprise Officer's Manual'' (1980).  It holds more closely to the D7 battlecruiser hull markings and is also loosely based upon the conceptual art of Matt Jeffries, [[Star Trek: The Original Series|TOS]] set designer. 

Its letters map to various letters and digraphs of English, but they have no relation to Marc Okrand's Klingon language.  Like the other two alphabets, it is probably written in the same direction as English.  
::''Some fans have suggested this alphabet could be used to write [[Klingonaase]] in its native form.''

== Vocabulary ==
A design principle of the Klingon language is the great degree of lexical-cultural correlation in the vocabulary. For example, there are several words meaning "to fight" or "to clash against", each having a different degree of intensity. There are a plethora of words relating to warfare and weaponry and also a great variety of curses (cursing is considered a fine art in Klingon culture). This helps lend a particular character to the language.

There are also a very large number of "in jokes" built into the language.<ref>[http://www.kli.org/wiki/index.php?Puns%20in%20the%20Vocabulary%20of%20tlhIngan%20Hol Puns in the Vocabulary of tlhIngan Hol]</ref> For example, the word for "pair" is ''chang'eng'', a reference to the twins [[Chang and Eng]], and the word for "fish" is ''[[Ghoti|ghotI']]''.

==Cultural References==
