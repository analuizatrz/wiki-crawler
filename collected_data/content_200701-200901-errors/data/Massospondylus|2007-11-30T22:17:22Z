'''''Massospondylus''''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], meaning "elongated vertebra"), is a [[genus]] of [[prosauropoda|prosauropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the early [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] ([[Hettangian]] to [[Pliensbachian]] [[faunal stage|ages]], around 200 to 183 [[annum|million years ago]]). It was described by Sir [[Richard Owen]] in 1854 from remains found in [[South Africa]], and is thus one of the first dinosaurs to have been named. Fossils have since been found in [[Lesotho]], [[Zimbabwe]], and other parts of South Africa. Further material from [[Arizona]]'s [[Kayenta Formation]], [[India]], and [[Argentina]] has been ascribed to this genus, but may not belong to ''Massospondylus''. The [[type species|type]], and only universally recognized species, is ''M. carinatus'', although six other species have been named during the past 150 years. The family name [[Massospondylidae]] was once erected for the genus, but because knowledge of prosauropod relationships is in a state of flux, it is not clear which other dinosaurs, if any, belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids. 

Long depicted as [[quadruped]]al, a recent study indicates ''Massospondylus'' was a [[bipedalism|biped]]. It was probably a plant eater ([[Herbivory|herbivore]]), although it is speculated that the prosauropods may have been [[Omnivore|omnivorous]]. This four [[metre|meter]] long animal had a long neck and tail with a small head and slender body. It bore a sharp thumb claw on each of its forefeet, used in defense or feeding. Recent studies indicate ''Massospondylus'' grew steadily, possessed air sacs similar to those of birds, and may have cared for its young.

==Description==
[[Image:Massospondylus BW.jpg|250px|thumb|left|This artist's impression of ''Massospondylus'' depicts the animal as bipedal. Recent studies indicate ''Massospondylus'' and its sister taxon ''Plateosaurus'' could not move about quadrupedally.]]
''Massospondylus'' was a mid-sized [[prosauropoda|prosauropod]] at around 4&nbsp;meters (13&nbsp;ft) long and weighed around 135&nbsp;[[kilogram]]s (300&nbsp;lb),<ref name="Seebacher01">{{cite journal| last =Seebacher| first =Frank| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =A new method to calculate allometric length-mass relationships of dinosaurs| journal =Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology| volume =21| issue =1| pages =51–60| publisher =| location =| date =2001| url =| doi =| id =| accessdate =2007-11-03}}</ref> possibly reaching a length of 6&nbsp;meters (20&nbsp;ft).<ref name=DFG00>{{cite book|chapter=Massospondylus |last=Glut |first=Donald F. |authorlink=Donald F.

The study also ruled out the possibility of "knuckle-walking" and other forms of locomotion that would avoid the issue of the limited ability of ''Massospondylus'' to [[pronation|pronate]] its hands. Although its mass suggests a quadrupedal nature, it would have been restricted to its hind legs for locomotion.<ref name ="Bon07">{{Citation| first =Matthew F.| last =Bonnan| author-link =| first2 =Phil| last2 =Senter| author2-link =| editor-last =Barrett| editor-first =P.M.| editor2-last =Batten| editor2-first =D.J.| contribution =Were the basal sauropodomorph dinosaurs ''Plateosaurus'' and ''Massospondylus'' habitual quadrupeds?| contribution-url =| title =Evolution and Palaeobiology of Early Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs.

''Massospondylus'' was a typical prosauropod in most other respects. It possessed a slender body and long neck, with around nine long cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] faced forward, as with most [[saurischia]]ns. It had a slighter build than that of ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', an otherwise similar prosauropod dinosaur.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> A recent discovery shows that ''Massospondylus'' possessed well-developed [[clavicle]]s, joined in a [[furcula]]-like arrangement, suggesting both that it had immobile [[scapula|shoulder blades]], and that clavicles were not rudimentary and nonfunctional in those dinosaurs that did not have true furculae.  This discovery also indicates that the furcula of [[bird]]s is derived from clavicles.<ref name=YV05>{{cite journal |last=Yates |first=Adam M. |coauthors=and Vasconcelos, Cecilio C. |year=2005 |title=Furcula-like clavicles in the prosauropod dinosaur ''Massospondylus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=466–468 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2005)025[0466:FCITPD]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

Like ''Plateosaurus'', it had five digits on each foot, with a large thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The fourth and fifth digits of the forepaws were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look. The 2007 study indicated that ''Massospondylus'' held its [[manus (zoology)|manus]] (hands) in a semi-supinated ("prayer-like") orientation, with the palmar surfaces facing one another; the wrist was never found rotated in articulated (still-connected) fossil specimens.<ref name="Bon07"/> 

The small head of ''Massospondylus'' was approximately half the length of the [[femur]]. The skull bore two pairs of [[temporal fenestra]]e, two almost circular eye sockets, and large elliptical [[nostril|nares]]. The [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] was proportionally larger in ''Massospondylus'' than in related genera such as ''Plateosaurus''. There was a pair of [[antorbital fenestra]]e between the eyes and the nose, which were smaller than those seen in ''Plateosaurus''. Behind the eyes was a fourth pair of holes called the [[infratemporal fenestra]]e. These holes reduced the weight of the skull, and were filled with nonbony tissue in the living animal.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> The shape of the skull is traditionally restored as wider and shorter than that of ''Plateosaurus'', but this appearance may just be due to differential crushing experienced by the various specimens.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> Some features of the skull are variable between individuals, for example the thickness of the upper border of the orbit and the height of the posterior [[maxilla]].  These differences may be due to [[sexual dimorphism]]<ref name=GKR90>{{cite journal |last=Gow |first=Christoper E. |coauthors=Kitching, J.W.; and Raath, Michael K. |year=1990 |title=Skulls of the prosauropod dinosaur ''Massospondylus carinatus'' Owen in the collections of the Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research |journal=Palaeontologia Africana |volume=27 |pages=45–58}}</ref> or individual variation.<ref name=PMG97>{{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M. |authorlink=Peter Galton |year=1997 |title=Comments on sexual dimorphism in the prosauropod dinosaur ''Plateosaurus engelhardti'' (Upper Triassic, Trossingen) |journal=Neus Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie, Monatshefte |volume=11 |pages=674–682}}</ref>

As with other prosauropods, it has been proposed that ''Massospondylus'' had cheeks.  This is based on there being few but large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when ''Massospondylus'' ate.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of ''Massospondylus'' as possessing pronounced [[malocclusion|overbite]]s, and suggested the presence of a [[keratin|horny]] beak on the tip of the lower jaw to make up the difference in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout.<ref name=CA86>{{cite book |last=Crompton |first=A.W. |coauthors=and Attridge, John |year=1986 |chapter=Masticatory apparatus of the larger herbivores during Late Triassic and Early Jurassic times |editor=Padian, Kevin (ed.) |title=The Beginning of the Age of Dinosaurs: Faunal Change Across the Triassic–Jurassic Boundary |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=223–236 |isbn=0521367794 }}</ref> However, this was later shown to be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top-bottom plane. Skulls not crushed in this orientation do not show an overbite.<ref name=GKR90/> There also seems to be some variation of tooth morphology, based upon the position of teeth in the jaw, although this is not as pronounced as the specialization of teeth in ''[[Heterodontosaurus]]''. Teeth occupying a position closer to the front of the snout had round cross-sections and tapered to points, unlike the back teeth, which were [[spatula]]te and had oval cross-sections.<ref name="Dinosauria"/>

A number of dinosaurs are often considered synonymous with ''Massospondylus''.

They were named after ''Massospondylus'' was described in a scientific paper; thus the name ''Massospondylus'' takes priority.

==Classification==

==Paleobiology==
As with all dinosaurs, much of the biology of ''Massospondylus'', including its behavior, coloration, and physiology, remains unknown. However, recent studies have allowed for some informed speculation on subjects such as growth patterns,<ref name="Sanderklein"/> diet,<ref name="Weemsetal"/> posture,<ref name="Bon07"/> reproduction,<ref name="Reiszetal05"/> and respiration.<ref name="Wedel"/>

A 2007 study suggested that ''Massospondylus'' may have used its short arms in defense from predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were too short to reach its mouth. Scientists speculate that ''Massospondylus'' could have used its large [[thumb|pollex]] (thumb) claw in combat or to strip plant material from trees.<ref name ="Bon07"/> 

===Growth===
A 2005 study indicated that ''Massospondylus''' sister taxon ''Plateosaurus'' exhibited growth patterns affected by environmental factors. The study indicated that when food was plentiful, or when the climate was favorable, ''Plateosaurus'' exhibited accelerated growth. This pattern of growth is called developmental plasticity. It is not seen in other dinosaurs, including ''Massospondylus'', despite the close relationship between ''Plateosaurus'' and ''Massospondylus''.

===Diet===
Prosauropods such as ''Massospondylus'' may have been either [[Herbivory|herbivorous]] or possibly [[omnivore|omnivorous]]. As recently as the 1980s, there was debate amongst paleontologists concerning possible [[carnivore|carnivory]] in prosauropods.<ref name="Cooper"/><ref name="Attridgeetal85"/> However, the hypothesis of carnivorous prosauropods has been discredited, and all recent studies favor a herbivorous or omnivorous lifestyle for these animals.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> [[Gastrolith]]s (gizzard stones) have been found in association with ''Massospondylus'' fossils,<ref name="Weemsetal">{{cite journal| last =Weems| first =Robert E.| authorlink =| coauthors =Culp, Michelle J. and Wings, Oliver| title =Evidence for Prosauropod Dinosaur Gastroliths in the Bull Run Formation (Upper Triassic, Norian) of Virginia| journal =Ichnos| volume =13| issue =3–4| pages =271–295| publisher =| location =| date =2007| url =| doi =10.1080/10420940601050030| id =| accessdate =2007-10-27}}</ref> indicating ''Massospondylus'' swallowed stones to aid in digestion.

===Reproduction===
[[Image:Massospondylus baby BW.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An artist's depiction of a juvenile ''Massospondylus'', shown here as a quadruped.]]
In the [[1970s]], seven 190-million year old ''Massospondylus'' eggs were found in [[Golden Gate Highlands National Park]] in [[South Africa]] by [[James Kitching]], who identified them as most likely belonging to ''Massospondylus''. It took nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 15&nbsp;[[centimetre|centimeter]] (6&nbsp;in) long embryos. They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found. Notably, the near-hatchlings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves. Scientists speculate that after-birth care might have been necessary based on the body proportions and the lack of teeth. The four legs of the near-hatchlings were of equal length, indicating that newly-hatched ''Massospondylus'' were quadrupedal. The skull and eye were proportionately over-sized, as in other very young vertebrates.  The quadrupedality of the hatchlings suggest that the quadrupedal posture of later [[sauropod]]s may have evolved from retention of juvenile characteristics in adult animals, an evolutionary phenomenon known as [[pedomorphosis]].<ref name="Reiszetal05">{{cite journal| last =Reisz| first =Robert R.| authorlink =| coauthors =Scott, Diane; Sues, Hans-Dieter; Evans, David C. and Raath, Michael A.| title =Embryos of an Early Jurassic prosauropod dinosaur and their evolutionary significance| journal =Science| volume =309| issue =| pages =761–764| publisher =| location =| date =2005| url =| doi =10.1126/science.1114942| id =| accessdate =2007-10-24}}</ref>

===Respiratory system===
Many [[saurischia]]n dinosaurs possessed vertebrae and ribs which contained hollowed-out cavities (pneumatic [[Foramina of skull|foramina]]) which reduced the weight of the bones and may have served as a basic 'flow-through ventilation' system similar to that of modern birds. In avians, the neck vertebrae and ribs are hollowed out by the cervical air sac, the upper back vertebrae by the [[lung]], and the lower back and [[sacrum|sacral]] (hip) vertebrae by the abdominal air sac. This complex method of respiration is very efficient.<ref name=oconnorclaessens2006>{{cite_journal |last=O'Connor |first=Patrick M. |coauthors=& Claessens, Leon P.A.M. |year=2006 |title=Basic avian pulmonary design and flow-through ventilation in non-avian theropod dinosaurs |journal=Nature |volume=436 |issue=7048 |pages=253–256 |doi=10.1038/nature03716}}</ref> Prosauropods were unusual as the only major group of saurischians which lacked an extensive system of pneumatic foramina. Although possible pneumatic indentations have been found in ''Plateosaurus'' and ''Thecodontosaurus'', these hollows were very small. One study in 2007 concluded that it was likely that prosauropods like ''Massospondylus'' had abdominal and cervical air sacs because of the good evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods). The study concluded that it was not possible to determine whether prosauropods had a bird-like flow-through lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present.<ref name="Wedel">{{cite journal| last =Wedel| first =Mathew| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =What pneumaticity tells us about 'prosauropods', and vice versa| journal =Special Papers in Palaeontology| volume =77| issue =| pages =207–222| publisher =| location =| date =2007| url =http://sauroposeidon.net/Wedel_2007_pneumaticity-and-prosauropods.pdf| doi =| id =| accessdate =2007-10-31}}</ref>
