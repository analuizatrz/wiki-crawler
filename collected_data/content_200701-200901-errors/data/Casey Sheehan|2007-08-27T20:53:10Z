'''Casey Austin Sheehan''' ([[May 29]], [[1979]]&ndash;[[April 4]], [[2004]]) was a [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] in the [[United States Army]] who was killed by enemy action while serving in the [[Iraq War]]. He is the son of Patrick Sheehan, a sales representative, and [[Cindy Sheehan]], who subsequently became a prominent [[anti-war]] protester.  

==Early years==
He joined the [[Cub Scouts]] at the age of six. At eight he became an [[altar server]] at his church. In 1996, he attained the rank of [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], the second one awarded by his Boy Scout Troop (180).<ref name = Black5> [http://www.blackfive.net/main/2005/08/army_specialist.html Army Specialist Casey Sheehan - Someone You Should (Have) Know(n)], ''[[Blackfive]] blog'',

He graduated from Vacaville High School in [[Vacaville, California]] with honors in 1997. In 2000 he graduated from [[Solano Community College]] 
with an [[associate's degree]] in [[Drama]].<ref> [http://www.pigstye.net/iraq/article.php/20040408080120836 Casey Sheehan], ''[[The Iraq Page]]'' </ref> 

==Military service==
In May 2000, Sheehan enlisted in the [[United States Army]] as a light-wheeled vehicle mechanic, [[List of United States Army MOS#CMF 63 - Mechanical Maintenance|MOS 63B]]. It has been reported that he had originally wanted to be a [[Chaplain]]'s assistant 
[[List of United States Army MOS # Chaplain Branch|MOS 56M]]. <!-- citation overlinked --> (Sheehan had acted as an [[altar server]] during the [[Palm Sunday]] mass on the morning of his death).<ref> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42498-2005Feb21.html For Some, a Loss in Iraq Turns Into Antiwar Activism: Gold Star Families Band Together to 'Make People Care'], ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[February 22]] [[2005]] </ref> 

Near the end of his tour of duty, the U.S. invasion of Iraq began. Sheehan re-enlisted, knowing that his unit would be sent to [[Iraq]]<ref>[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=1860 Cindy Sheehan Has an Agenda], ''American Chronicle''</ref>. Sheehan's division, the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|First Cavalry Division]], was sent to Iraq. On [[March 19]], [[2004]], Sheehan's unit, C Battery, 1st Battalion, [[82nd Field Artillery Regiment]] arrived at [[Forward Operating Base|FOB]] War Eagle in [[Sadr City]]. Just a few weeks later, on [[April 4]], [[2004]], Sheehan was killed in action after volunteering as part of a [[Quick Reaction Force]] to rescue American troops.

===Burial===
Sheehan is buried in Vacaville-Elmira Cemetery in Vacaville, California. In May 2006, his mother provided a tombstone at his grave following criticism that Casey, who died in 2004, lacked a gravestone. Cindy Sheehan paid for the tombstone herself, stating "It is important for the rest of Casey's family to have one... I guess the pain of seeing it etched in marble that he is dead is another pain I will have to deal with." Cindy Sheehan maintains that the U.S. "government should have paid for it because of its responsibility for his death." The [[Department of Veterans Affairs]] does provide such monuments upon request.<ref> [http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/sheehangrave.asp Claim: Cindy Sheehan failed to provide a tombstone for her son's grave -- Status: true], ''[[Urban Legends Reference Pages|Snopes]]'' </ref>
