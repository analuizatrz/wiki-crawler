'''Hurricane Irene''' was a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] that produced moderate damage across southern [[Florida]] during the [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The ninth tropical storm and the sixth hurricane of the season, Irene developed in the western [[Caribbean Sea]] on [[October 13]] from a [[tropical wave]]. It moved northward, hitting western [[Cuba]] before attaining hurricane status. Irene struck Florida as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]], moved across the state, and moved northward over the [[Gulf Stream]]. It approached the [[Carolinas]] but remained offshore. Irene turned eastward, and rapidly intensified to reach [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2]] Hurricane Status before becoming extratropical due to cooler waters.

The hurricane first produced heavy rainfall across western Cuba, causing four deaths and damage. Irene was a wet Florida hurricane in October, similar to many hurricanes of the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=[[Lixion Avila]]|year=1999|title=Hurricane Irene Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-06-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1999irene.html}}</ref> The hurricane produced 10 to 20&nbsp;inches (255 to 510&nbsp;mm) of rainfall in the [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] metropolitan area, causing urban flooding unseen since [[1981 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Dennis|Tropical Storm Dennis]] in 1981. Despite being only a Category 1 hurricane, Irene caused 8 indirect deaths and $800&nbsp;million (1999 [[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage across Florida.<ref name="summary">{{cite web|author=NOAA|year=1999|title=NOAA News- Summary of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season|accessdate=2006-06-25|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s329.htm}}</ref>

The hurricane produced flooding and caused one death in the northwestern [[Bahamas]]. In [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]], Irene produced heavy rainfall of over 10&nbsp;inches (255&nbsp;mm), adding more flooding after previous Hurricanes [[Hurricane Dennis (1999)|Dennis]] and [[Hurricane Floyd|Floyd]]. The flooding closed many roads, and caused rivers to crest past their banks, though damage in the area was relatively minor.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Irene 1999 track.png}}
A [[trough (meteorology)|broad area of low pressure]] formed over the western [[Caribbean Sea]] on [[October 8]], and it persisted until [[October 11]], when a tropical wave reached the area and caused the [[convection]] to organize, resulting in the development of a low-level circulation. Convection increased and organized around the circulation's center late on [[October 12]], and the system organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on [[October 13]] off the north coast of [[Honduras]]. The depression continued to organize over the favorable conditions present in the Caribbean Sea, and attained tropical storm status later on the 13th, when it was assigned the name Irene.<ref name="tcr"/> Operationally, the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength.<ref name="tsdisc">{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|year=1999|title=Tropical Storm Irene Discussion Number One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-06-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/1999/dis/NAL1399.001.html}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Irene strengthened as it moved northward, and reached maximum sustained winds of 70&nbsp;mph (115&nbsp;km/h) early on [[October 14]]. Operationally, Irene was upgraded to a hurricane on the 14th, although later analysis after the hurricane season indicated it remained a tropical storm until later. Irene continued to move towards the north-northeast, crossed over the western portion of the [[Isla de la Juventud]] as a strong tropical storm, and hours later, it struck mainland [[Cuba]] near [[Batabano]]. The storm was able to strengthen further over the [[Florida Straits]], and Irene attained hurricane status on [[October 15]]. It passed over [[Key West]], turned more to the north-northeast, and struck mainland [[Florida]] at [[Cape Sable]] as an 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) hurricane.<ref name="tcr"/>

[[Image:Hurricane Irene (1999)- SC.JPG|right|thumb|Hurricane Irene at peak intensity]]
Irene entered the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near [[Jupiter, Florida]] early on [[October 16]], still as a Category 1 hurricane. It turned to the north, remained a hurricane despite little convection, then turned to the northeast in response to an approaching upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. Just offshore, Irene moved parallel to the coastlines of [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]] on [[October 17]]. On [[October 18]], as it interacted with very warm ocean waters and the upper level trough, Irene rapidly intensified, reaching peak winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) with a pressure of 952&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]], a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2]] hurricane. Despite its strength, the circulation was very asymmetrical, and the convection was not particularly organized. The hurricane continued to accelerate to the northeast, steadily weakening until becoming extratropical on [[October 19]] to the south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The extratropical storm continued to the northeast until becoming absorbed by another, larger extratropical storm late that same day.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
In [[Cuba]], slightly over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm. Around 10% stayed in temporary shelters, while the rest stayed with family or friends.<ref name="cubstuff">{{cite web|author=Cuban Red Cross|year=1999|title=Cuba: Hurricane Irene|accessdate=2006-06-25|url=http://www.ifrc.org/docs/appeals/99/279901.pdf}}</ref> Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists<ref name="cnn">{{cite news|author=John Zarrella & Jeff Flock|year=1999|title=Hurricane Irene makes landfall in SW Florida|publisher=Cnn.com|accessdate=2006-06-25|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WEATHER/9910/15/irene.05/}}</ref> and over 1,000 residents in rickety houses.

Initially, forecasters predicted Irene to parallel the west coast of [[Florida]], weakening to a tropical storm before making landfall on the west-central portion of the state. However, when a more eastward track became evident,<ref name="srh">{{cite web|author=D. Scott Kelly, Matthew W. Bragaw and Scott M.

While moving northward off the coast of [[Florida]], Irene was initially expected to make landfall along the [[South Carolina]] coastline, prompting the National Hurricane Center to issue a Hurricane Warning from [[Edisto Beach, South Carolina]] to [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]]. Because of this, voluntary evacuation orders were issued for portions of South Carolina. However, when the track shifted further to the east, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for coastal areas of North Carolina, with tens of thousands removed from their homes. The evacuation order included several beach towns; those living in low-lying areas and mobile homes were advised to seek shelter. In addition, many of those left homeless from [[Hurricane Floyd]]'s passage just weeks before were evacuated to shelters. [[Jim Hunt]], the [[Governor of North Carolina]], declared a state of emergency, with the state's emergency management team switching from a recovery objective towards a preparations mission.<ref name="bbc2">{{cite web|author=BBC NEWS|year=1999|title=Irene deluge hits North Carolina|accessdate=2006-06-29|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/477969.stm}}</ref>

Irene killed 18&nbsp;people (15 indirectly) and caused $800&nbsp;million ($937&nbsp;million 2006 USD) in damage. Most of the damage and deaths occurred due to the torrential rain the storm caused.

===Cuba===
While crossing [[Cuba]], Irene produced heavy rainfall.

===Florida===
[[Image:Hurricane Irene - Flooding.jpg|right|thumb|Flooding from Irene]]
While moving through the [[Florida Keys]], Irene produced a storm surge of up to 2.3&nbsp;feet (0.7&nbsp;m) in [[Key Vaca, Florida|Key Vaca]], while [[Key West]] reported a surge of 1.5&nbsp;feet (0.5&nbsp;m). The hurricane produced sustained winds peaking at 79&nbsp;mph (127&nbsp;km/h); it also produced strong gusts, the strongest of which was clocked at 102&nbsp;mph (164&nbsp;km/h) at [[Big Pine Key, Florida|Big Pine Key]].<ref name="tcr"/> Irene produced heavy rainfall in the Keys, including 12&nbsp;inches (305&nbsp;mm) of rain in Key West. The rainfall flooded roads throughout the Keys, prompting officials to close 50&nbsp;miles (80 km) of [[U.S. Route 1|U.S. Highway 1]]. Irene spawned a tornado in [[Islamorada, Florida|Islamorada]], causing heavy damage to three houses. Moderate wind gusts caused power outages throughout the Keys, but damage was overall minor.<ref name="cnnkey">{{cite web|author=John Zarrella & Jeff Flock|year=1999|title=Hurricane Irene pulls plug on 700,000 utility customers|publisher=Cnn.com|accessdate=2006-06-28|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9910/15/irene.07/}}</ref>

Despite moving across the state as a minimal hurricane, there were no reports of hurricane-force winds on mainland [[Florida]]. The highest official recorded wind report was 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], while the highest accurate wind gust was 71&nbsp;mph (114&nbsp;km/h) in [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]]. In addition to the National Weather Service Reports, the South Florida Water Management District reported higher wind gusts near [[Lake Okeechobee]] of up to 93&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h) in [[Belle Glade, Florida|Belle Glade]], though these were likely caused by small-scale [[Mesoscale meteorology|meso-cyclone]]-induced [[downburst]]s.<ref name="tcr"/> Irene produced heavy rainfall across southeastern Florida, peaking at 17.45&nbsp;inches (443&nbsp;mm) at [[Boynton Beach, Florida|Boynton Beach]], though many areas in the [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami Metropolitan Area]] received from 10 to 15&nbsp;inches (255 to 380&nbsp;mm).

==Aftermath==
Following the hurricane, the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] launched an emergency appeal for [[Cuba]]. The appeal raised $217,498 (1999 [[Swiss franc|CHF]], $193,757 2006 USD) to supply hygiene items, household goods, water purification tablets, and water containers to the 12,000 living in temporary shelters. The appeal asked for repair supplies and to improve the response capacity of the national society for future disasters. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized over 4,500 volunteers to the effected areas to provide first aid to injured, distribute meals and medical supplies, and collaborate with blood banks.<ref name="cubstuff"/> The government-controlled media broadcast system guaranteed repair items, though many people remained in damaged houses in the weeks after the storm.<ref name="morecub">{{cite web|author=José Orlando González Bridón|year=1999|title=UNFULFILLED PROMISES TO VICTIMS OF HURRICANE IRENE|publisher=CUBA FREE PRESS|accessdate=2006-07-01|url=http://www.cubafreepress.org/art2/cubap991201j.html}}</ref>

Just days after Irene moved through [[Florida]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] declared 18&nbsp;counties as disaster areas. The declaration allowed effected businesses and homeowners to apply for federal assistance, such as money for temporary housing, minor home repairs, or disaster-related expenses. In addition, the president issued an emergency declaration for Florida, which released federal resources to aid in debris removal and emergency services.<ref name="declar">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=1999|title=Disaster Aid Ordered For Florida Hurricane Recovery|accessdate=2006-07-06|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=8619}}</ref> In addition, President Clinton declared the 66&nbsp;counties in [[North Carolina]] eligible for assistance due to [[Hurricane Floyd]] were also eligible for more assistance due to damage from Irene.<ref name="ncdecl">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=1999|title=Hurricane Irene Victims Now Eligible For Federal Aid|accessdate=2006-07-06|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=9194}}</ref>

Despte the damage, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] did not retire the name '''Irene''' during its meeting in the following spring. As a result, it was [[Hurricane Irene (2005)|reused]] in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], and is on the [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#North Atlantic|list of names]] to be used in 2011.
