The United Kingdom entered the JESC three times, and the broadcaster is [[ITV]].
[[Tom Morley]] (2003) and [[Cory Spedding]] (2004) sang both for the peace in the world and [[Joni Fuller]] (2005) described her feelings. 
There was no UK representative in [[JESC]] 2006: ITV had stopped broadcasting the show as their three year contract had ended. The BBC, Channel 4 and S4C had no intention of broadcasting the contest, this meant that the UK was absent from a Eurovision contest for the first time since 1958.

The UK holds the third highest number of total points: 140 points in 2004.

The results of the partipication has been successful. They have taken a 2nd place as well as 3rd place.

It is almost certain that ITV will return in 2007.
