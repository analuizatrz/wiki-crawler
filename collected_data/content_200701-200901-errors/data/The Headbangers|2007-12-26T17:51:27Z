'''The Headbangers''' were the [[tag team]] of [[Charles Warrington|Mosh]] and [[Glen Ruth|Thrasher]] whose most notable matches were in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). As the name of the team implied, their [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] was that they were a pair of [[headbanging|headbangers]], complete with [[Heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] related T-shirts, piercings, shaved heads, and black [[face paint]].

===1996-1998===
The team first debuted on WWF TV as the '''Sisters of Love''', Sister Angelica & Mother Smucker. This would see them dressed as [[nun]]s serving as the proteges of [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]]. The gimmick was short-lived, but they kept the skirts when they became The Headbangers in [[January 1997]]<ref name=history>[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/97.htm The History of WWE - 1997] TheHistoryofWWE.com Retrieved December 9, 2007.</ref>. They later had T-shirts with the phrase, "Real men wear skirts." The duo often carried a [[boombox]] to the ring, and on one occasion, Mosh [[vomit|vomited]] during an [[promo (professional wrestling)|interview]]. Considering WWF's transformation into its [[World Wrestling Entertainment#The Attitude Era|Attitude Era]] in this period, The Headbangers were clearly a sign of the times.

Throughout [[1997]], The Headbangers [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with [[The Godwinns]] as well as [[Doug Furnas]] & [[Philip Lafond|Phil Lafon]], often finding themselves on the [[job (professional wrestling)|losing]] end. They faced [[Legion of Doom]] during their surpise return match on [[February 24]] to a double [[Professional wrestling#Countout|count-out]]. At ''[[WrestleMania 13]]'', The Headbangers won a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|4-way elimination match]] for a shot at the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championships]]. The team was seen on [[New York]]'s [[WABC-TV]] in [[June 1997|June]], which would re-air on WWF programming. The Headbangers' title success came when they won the vacant Tag Team titles at ''[[In Your House#In Your House 17: Ground Zero|In Your House 17]]'' due to [[List of professional wrestling slang#R|interference]] by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]. They faced the [[New Age Outlaws]] in their debut match on [[October 20]] and would frequently challenge them into the following the year for the Tag Team titles.

The two are seen backstage playing with [[Bret Hart]]'s son, Blade, in the [[1998 in film|1998]] [[documentary film]] ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]''. The footage depicts events from the previous year. 

Both Mosh and Thrasher entered the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 ''Royal Rumble'']] and both lasted over 10 minutes before Mosh was eliminated by [[Kurrgan]] and Thrasher by Steve Austin. On [[February 17]], [[1998]], The Headbangers won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] during a WWF program. They would feud with [[The Quebecers]] and the [[Oddities]] throughout the year and become the first [[MCW Tag Team Championship|MCW Tag Team Champions]] on [[August 18]].

===1999-2000===
The Headbangers were both meant to compete in the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 ''Royal Rumble'']] but were injured before the event. Consequently, they were used sparingly throughout [[1999]]. Mosh, repackaged as Beaver Cleavage and then Chaz, performed in singles competition and began having problems with his on-screen girlfriend, [[Marianna Komlos]]. He would be ([[kayfabe]]) arrested on [[September 14]] after she claimed he [[Spousal abuse|hit her]]. After Chaz's match on [[October 5]], Glen Ruth (Thrasher) showed GTV footage of Mariana applying makeup to create the effect of wounds. This proved her accusations false, and The Headbangers would subsequently reunite. They then  took on a gimmick where they would dress as the opponents that they feuded with, such as the [[Dudley Boyz]] and [[Mean Street Posse]]. The duo later turned [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], and began to dress in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], most notably wearing breast cones.

Mosh entered in the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|2000 ''Royal Rumble'']] alone; however, The Headbangers continued performing in tag team and singles matches. Both men participated in the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore]] [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] at ''[[WrestleMania 2000]]'' where Thrasher held the title for [[List of WWE Hardcore Championship reigns by length|43 seconds]]. The team continued battling the likes of [[Too Cool]] and [[T & A (professional wrestling)|T & A]] until mid [[2000]]. They then separated and formed other tag teams; while Mosh joined [[Accie Connor|D'lo Brown]] as Chaz to form 'Lo Down, Thrasher would form a short lived tag team with [[Jeff Hardy]] to form Thrardy.

Glen Ruth was released from WWF in [[2000]] and performed [[independent circuit|independently]] briefly before retiring. Charles Warrington (Mosh) was released from WWF in [[July 2001]] and continues performing occasionally at [[Florida]] shows.
