== Story ==

Rupa ([[Kamalinee Mukherjee]]) is an orphan whose parents die at a young age, due to negligent driving by a drunkard who happens to be the hero Anand's ([[Raja (actor)|Raja]]) father. This accident haunts his father, who finally turns insane. The family always swallows the bitter pill of guilt, and has a soft corner for Rupa. After her marriage is fixed, she calls it off due to her fiancé Rahul's mother's dominating behavior. Out of plain curiosity and concern, Anand moves into her neighbouring apartment and keeps a tab on her, and eventually falls in love with her. He loves her deeply and sincerely. He also feels that marrying Rupa will in a small way atone for his family's crime. How they finally unite is the rest of the story.
