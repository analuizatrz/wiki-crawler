The '''Octopus card''' is a rechargeable [[Contactless payment|contactless]] stored value [[smart card]] used to transfer [[electronic money|electronic payment]]s in online or offline systems in [[Hong Kong]]. Originally launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the city's [[mass transit system]], the Octopus card system has since grown into a widely used payment system for virtually all public [[transport in Hong Kong]].<ref name="WorldBank">{{cite web|url=http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/External/lac/lac.nsf/Sectors/Transport/D5A576A039A802C0852568B2007988AD?OpenDocument|title=Hong Kong Smart Card System|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> It is also used for payment at [[convenience store]]s, [[supermarket]]s, [[fast-food restaurant]]s, on-street [[parking meter]]s, [[car park]]s, and other [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] applications such as [[filling station|service stations]] and [[vending machine]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/en/index.jsp|title=Octopus Products|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref>  The Octopus card has been internationally recognised, winning the Chairman's Award of the [[World Information Technology and Services Alliance]]'s 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for being the world's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system, and for its innovative use of technologies.<ref name="WITSA">{{cite web|url=http://www.witsa.org/press/05-04-06_WITSA_AWARDS_rev.doc|title=WITSA Announces 2006 Global IT Excellence Award Winners|publisher=World Information Technology and Services Alliance|date=[[2006-05-04]]|accessdate=2007-05-01|format=DOC}}</ref>  According to [[Octopus Cards Limited]], operator of the Octopus card system, there are more than 14 million cards in circulation, twice the population of Hong Kong.  The cards are used by 95 percent of the population of Hong Kong aged 16 to 65, generating over 10 million daily transactions worth a total of about [[HK$]]29 billion ([[US$]]3.7 billion) a year.<ref name=statistics>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/corporate/why/statistics/en/index.jsp|title=Statistics|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-02-27}}</ref>

==History==
The Mass Transit Railway ([[MTR]]), one of Hong Kong's railways, adopted a system of recirculated magnetic plastic cards as fare tickets when it started operations in 1979.  Another of the city's railways, the [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]] (KCR), adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed [[Common Stored Value Tickets]].  In 1989, the Common Stored Value Tickets system was extended to [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] (KMB) buses providing a feeder service to MTR and KCR stations and to [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]], and was also extended to a limited number of non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.<ref name="Tradelink">{{cite web|url=http://www.tradelink-ebiz.com/english/331n08or3m9a51l/newscast/ss_0412a.html|title=Our winning card|publisher=Tradelink Electronic Commerce Limited|month=January|year=2005|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref>

The [[MTR Corporation]] eventually decided to adopt more advanced technologies, and in 1993 announced that it would move towards using contactless smartcards.  To gain wider acceptance, it partnered with four other major transit companies in Hong Kong to create a joint-venture business to operate the Octopus system in 1994, then known as Creative Star Limited.<ref name="HoldingsHistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/history/en/index.jsp|title=Our History|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref>  The Octopus system was launched after three years of trials on [[1 September]] [[1997]].<ref name="Clark">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/publications/economicperspectives/ep_4qtr2005_part3_clark_.pdf|title=Shopping without cash: The emergence of the e-purse|author=Carol L. Clark|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|year=2005|format=PDF|pages=12|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>  Three million cards were issued within the first three months of the system's launch.  The main reason for the quick success of the system was that the MTR and KCR required that all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, thus forcing their combined base commuters to switch quickly.<ref name="Siu">{{cite web|url=http://www.sociology.ed.ac.uk/finance/Papers/Siu_Octopus.pdf|title=Octopus and Mondex: The social shaping of money, technology and consensus|publisher=School of Social and Political Studies, University of Edinburgh|author=Lucia L.S. Siu|year=2002|month=April|accessdate=2007-04-25|format=PDF}}</ref>  Another reason is the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997; there was a belief that the older Queen's Head [[Coins of the Hong Kong dollar|coins in Hong Kong]] will appreciate in value, so many people stockpiled the older coins and waited for their value to increase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sc.info.gov.hk/gb/www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/ppr/press/p980218e.htm|title=Supply of new coins will continue|publisher=Hong Kong SAR Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau|date=[[1998-02-18]]|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/public/ar97/ch04.htm|title=Hong Kong Monetary Authority Annual Report 1997|publisher=Hong Kong Monetary Authority|year=1997|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>  The Octopus system was quickly adopted by other Creative Star joint venture partners, and KMB reported that by 2000, most bus journeys were completed using an Octopus card, with few coins used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmb.hk/english.php?page=next&file=news/service/news3q03/news2003112701.html|title=Development of KMB's Octopus Payment System|publisher=The Kowloon Motor Bus Company|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>  Boarding a bus in Hong Kong without using the Octopus card requires giving exact change; this is cumbersome compared to using the Octopus card.  By November 1998, 4.6 million cards were issued, and this rose to 9 million by January 2002.<ref name="Siu" />

In 2000, the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] granted a deposit-taking company license to the operator, removing previous restrictions that prohibited Octopus from generating more than 15 percent of its turnover from non-transit related functions, thus allowing the Octopus card to be widely adopted for non-transit-related sales transactions.<ref name="BIS">{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss48.pdf|title=Survey of electronic money developments|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|month=November|year=2001|accessdate=2007-04-16|format=PDF}}</ref>  On [[29 June]] [[2003]], the Octopus card found another application when the Hong Kong Government started to replace all its 18,000 parking meters with a new Octopus card operated system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200306/27/0627317.htm|title=Octopus-card operated parking meters to launch on June 29|publisher=Hong Kong SAR Government|date=[[2003-06-27]]|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>  The replacement was completed on [[21 November]] [[2004]].<ref name="ParkingMeter">{{cite web|url=http://www.td.gov.hk/transport_in_hong_kong/parking/carparks/octopus_operated_parking_meters/index.htm|title=Octopus operated Parking Meter|publisher=Transport Department of the HKSAR|date=[[2005-07-19]]|accessdate=2007-04-11}}</ref>

==Name and logo==
[[Image:Möbius strip.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Möbius strip made out of paper and adhesive tape]]
The [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] name for the Octopus card, ''Baat Daaht Tùng'' ({{zh-t|t={{linktext|八|達|通}}}}), literally means "eight-arrived pass". It was selected by the head of the MTR Corporation, the parent company of Octopus Cards Limited, in a naming competition held in 1996.<ref name="Milestones">{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/milestones/tc/index.jsp|title=八達通控股有限公司里程碑|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=2007-02-28|language=Traditional Chinese}}</ref> The number eight is a significant number in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] in that it is often used to indicate "many". For instance, the proverb ''sei tùng baat daaht'' ({{zh-t|t={{linktext|四|通|八|達}}}}) is a common expression loosely translated as "reachable in all directions".<ref>{{cite dictionary|encyclopedia=國語辭典 (Dictionary of the National Language)|url=http://140.111.34.46/cgi-bin/dict/GetContent.cgi?Database=dict&DocNum=136437&GraphicWord=yes&QueryString=四通八達|title=四通八達|publisher=Ministry of Education|location=Taipei, Taiwan|quote=四方相通的道路。形容交通便利。|date=1997-07-01|accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> It is also considered a [[Numbers in Chinese culture#Eight|lucky number in Chinese culture]], and the phrase ''baat daaht'' can possibly be associated with the similar-sounding ''faat daaht'' which means "getting rich" ({{zh-t|t={{linktext|發|達}}}}) in the local dialect.

The [[English language|English]] name ''Octopus card'' was also selected from the naming competition,<ref name="MilestonesEng">{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/milestones/en/index.jsp|title=Octopus Holdings Milestones|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> and coincides with the number eight in the Cantonese name, since an [[octopus]] has eight [[tentacle]]s. It is also particularly appropriate since an octopus is thought to be able to grab many things at the same time and this ability is conferred to its cardholders who can use it in many different types of transactions.

The logo used on the card features a [[Möbius strip]] twisted sideways and into the shape of the [[Arabic numerals|arabic numeral]] for the number eight, ''8'', to indicate the card's "infinite" possibilities. The mathematical symbol for [[infinity]], "∞", looks like a sideways ''8''.

==Types of cards==
There are two main types of Octopus card (''On-Loan'' and ''Sold''), and two less common types (the ''Airport Express Tourist'' and the ''MTR Airport Staff'').  

On-Loan cards are issued for usage in day-to-day functions, primarily for fare payment in transport systems.  They are further classified into ''Child'', ''Adult'', ''Elder'', and ''Personalised'' categories, with the first three based on age and different amounts of fare concession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/cardtype/en/loan.jsp|title=On-Loan Octopus|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>  With the exception of the ''Personalised'' cards, On-Loan cards are anonymous; no personal information, bank account, or credit card details are stored on the card,<ref name=knowledgebase>{{cite web|url=http://rfid.idtechex.com/knowledgebase/en/casestudy.asp?freefromsection=114|title=Hong Kong Octopus financial/transport card, China|publisher=The RFID Knowledgebase|date=[[2006-11-19]]|accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> and no identification is required for the purchase of these cards.  If an owner loses a card, only the stored value and the deposit of the card are lost.  On-Loan Octopus cards may be purchased at all MTR stations, the KMB Customer Service Centre, [[New World First Ferry]] (NWFF) Octopus Service Centres, and the [[New World First Bus]] (NWFB) Customer Service Centre.<ref name="GetOctopus">{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/apply/en/index.jsp|title=How to get Your Octopus|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> A student on-loan Octopus Card was initially issued, but has been discontinued since 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=已停售學生八達通 港鐵多扣錢|publisher=Ming Pao|language=Traditional Chinese|date=2007-12-02}}</ref>

The rainbow-coloured ''Personalised'' card is available on registration.  The name and, if opted, a photo of the holder are imprinted on the cards.  They can function automatically as a ''Child'', ''Adult'', or ''Elder'' card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on the card, hence accounting for different concessionary fares.  As of 2003, there were 380,000 holders of ''Personalised'' Octopus cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200305/21/0521207.htm|title=LCQ4 : Octopus card has a maximum reserved value of $35|publisher=Hong Kong SAR Government Information Centre|date=[[2003-05-21]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>  In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card can be used as a key card for access to residential and office buildings.<ref name="AccessControl">{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/other/access/en/index.jsp|title=Access Control|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref>  If a ''Personalised'' card is lost, the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent unauthorised use of the card.  A refund would then be issued to the holder of the card for the deposit and the value that remained on the card six hours after the loss is reported, minus a HK$30 card cost and a HK$20 handling fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/report/en/index.jsp|title=Lost Card Reporting|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref>

A ''Personalised'' card with "student status" is available for students in Hong Kong.  To be eligible for this card, the applicant must be a full-time Hong Kong student aged between 12 and 25.<ref name="MTRStudent">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/whatsnew/studentoct/studoct0607_e.htm|title=Student Travel Scheme (Academic year 2006 / 2007)|publisher=MTR Corporation|accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref>  This type of ''Personalised'' card is automatically issued to a student who applies for student concessionary privileges.

In contrast to On-Loan cards, Sold cards are sponsored and branded cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/cardtype/en/sold.jsp|title=Sold Octopus|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>  They are souvenir cards that are frequently released by Octopus Cards Limited.  The designs for these cards usually come from fictional characters in popular culture, or they are inspired by [[Chinese culture|Chinese cultural]] events such as [[Chinese New Year]].  These cards are sold at a premium, have limited or no initial stored value, and cannot be refunded, but they can otherwise be used as ordinary cards.  An example of the Sold card is the ''[[Mcmug]] and [[Mcdull]]'' collection.  It was launched at the end of January 2007 to coincide with the beginning of the [[Pig (zodiac)|Year of the Pig]], it features two differently designed versions of the card and is sold for HK$138 per set.  Each set comes with an ''Adult'' Octopus card, with a pouch for the card, a matching strap and a Mcmug or Mcdull ornament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20070129.jsp|title=Launch of Mcmug and Mcdull Limited Edition Octopus to Greet the Year of the Pig|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=[[2007-01-29]]|accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>  Octopus Cards Limited has launched new collections of these cards for such occasions as the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], the passing of the year 2004, and the release of the movie ''[[DragonBlade: The Legend of Lang|DragonBlade]]''.  Sold Octopus cards may be purchased at selected MTR stations, and all [[7-Eleven]] stores.<ref name="GetOctopus" />

The special-purpose card, ''Airport Express Tourist Octopus'', was introduced by Octopus Cards Limited to target [[Tourism in Hong Kong|tourists in Hong Kong]]. Two versions of this card are offered, a HK$220 card with a free single ride on the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]], the [[Mass Transit Railway]] (MTR) train line that runs between the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] and the urban areas of Hong Kong, and a HK$300 card with two free single rides included. The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase.  Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR  and include a HK$50 refundable deposit.  Usable value on these cards may be added if necessary. These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong for 14 or fewer days; users may be required to produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong.  ''Airport Express Tourist Octopus'' is available for purchase at all MTR stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/tourists/en/index.jsp|title=Octopus for Tourists|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> 

The other special-purpose card, the ''MTR Airport Staff Octopus'', is available for the staff of Hong Kong International Airport and [[AsiaWorld-Expo]], a convention centre close to the airport, for commuting at a reduced fare between the airport and MTR stations via the Airport Express.  Staff who apply for the card may use it for a discount of up to 64 percent for Airport Express single journey fares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etwb.hk/FileManager/EN/whats_new/possible_merger_of_mtrc_and_kcrc/Administration%20Response%20(Eng)%2026.5.06.pdf|title=Panel on Transport Meeting on 26 May 2006|publisher=Environment, Transport, and Works Bureau Government Secretariat|date=[[2006-07-04]]|accessdate=2007-02-25|format=PDF}}</ref>  The ''MTR Airport Staff Octopus'' is available upon application via the company for which that a staff member works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/type.jsp#faq5|title=FAQ: How do I apply for an MTR Airport Staff Octopus?|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref>

==Card usage==
The Octopus card was introduced for fare payment on the MTR initially, but the use of the card quickly expanded for multiple other purposes. The card can now be used to pay fares for all public transport in Hong Kong and to make purchases for consumer products at many stores in the city; it is accepted by more than 160 merchants.  Notable businesses that accept Octopus cards include [[PARKnSHOP]], [[Watsons]], [[7-Eleven]], [[Starbucks]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Circle K]]. The card can be used in many [[soft drink]] [[vending machine]]s, pay phones, photo booths, parking meters, and car parks.<ref name="SmartCardAlliance">{{cite web|url=http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~tijo/seminar/Case_Studies_and_Profiles_Report.pdf|title=Smart Card Case Studies and Implementation Profiles|publisher=Smart Card Alliance|date=December 2003|accessdate=2007-02-22|format=PDF}}</ref>  Aside from consumer transactions, Octopus cards can also be used for access control in buildings and for school administrative functions.<ref name="AccessControl" /><ref name="SchoolCampuses" />  At certain office buildings, residential buildings, and schools, usage of an Octopus card is required to access their facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://badgerherald.com/oped/2004/02/05/view_from_abroad_hon.php|title=View from abroad: Hong Kong's 'Octopus card' technology puts even credit card to shame|publisher=The Badger Herald|date=[[2004-02-05]]|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>  As of [[21 November]] [[2004]], all parking meters in Hong Kong had been converted to using the Octopus card as the form of payment.<ref name="ParkingMeter" />

===Payments===

[[Image:OctopusReaderGate.jpg|thumb|250px|Octopus reader at an [[MTR]] ticket gate]]
Making or recording a payment using the card for public transportation or while purchasing items at Octopus-enabled retailers can be done by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away, even if the card is in a wallet or a purse.  The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a ''beep'' sound, and display the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hong-kong-travel.org/Octopus.asp|title=Octopus|publisher=Hong Kong Travel|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>  Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cw.com.hk/computerworldhk/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=316427|title=Scrap the coins|publisher=Computerworld Hong Kong|date=[[2006-04-01]]|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>  When riding the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users show their card again at the exit point.

The MTR charge less for journeys made using an Octopus card instead of conventional single-journey tickets. For example, the adult fare of a single journey from [[Chai Wan (MTR)|Chai Wan]] to [[Tung Chung (MTR)|Tung Chung]] is HK$23.10 with an Octopus card, and HK$26 with a single journey ticket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/jplanner/jplanner/planner_index.php?start=14&destin=44&spot=1|title=Journey Time & Fare:  Chai Wan to Tung Chung
|publisher=MTR Corporation|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> . Other public transport operators also offer discounts, usually 10 percent, for using Octopus cards on higher fares and round-trip transits.<ref>{{cite web

On [[6 November]] [[2005]], Octopus Cards Limited launched Octopus Rewards, a program that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program.  Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20051105.jsp|title=Octopus Rewards Grand Launch|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=[[2005-11-05]]|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>  The rewards that the program offers are in the form of points, or ''reward dollars'', stored on the card.  Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/works/en/index.jsp|title=How It Works|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>  The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made.  At [[Wellcome]], for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWellcomeDetails.jsp|title=Wellcome|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> and at [[Watsons]], points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWatsonsDetails.jsp|title=Watsons|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>  Once these ''reward dollars'' are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per ''reward dollar''.  To redeem the accumulated ''reward dollars'', cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially.  If the purchase price is lower than the amount of ''reward dollars'' available, the amount difference remains stored on the card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/redeeming/en/index.jsp|title=Redeeming|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>  Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include [[HSBC]], [[UA Cinemas]], Watsons, Wellcome, and McDonald's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/en/index.jsp|title=Earning|publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

===Enquiring balances, adding value and refunding===
[[Image:OctopusEnquiryMachine.jpg|thumb|250px|Octopus card enquiry machine]]
[[Image:OctopusAddValueMachine.jpg|thumb|250px|Octopus card add value machine]]
In MTR stations, enquiry machines can be found where cardholders may place their Octopus cards on the machines and the machines will display the balances along with a history of last 10 usages.

Monetary value can be added to the card through a number of ways.  Add Value Machines, located at MTR stations, can be used to add more value to the cards.  The machines accept cash, and selected machines are also able to accept [[Electronic Funds Transfer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/payment/reload/en/index.jsp|title=Reload Your Octopus: Overview|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>  Alternatively, value may be added with cash at authorised service providers such as PARKnSHOP, Wellcome, Watsons, 7-Eleven, Circle K, and [[Café de Coral]], and also at customer service centres and ticketing offices at other transport stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/payment/reload/en/other.jsp|title=Reload Your Octopus: Other Reload Methods|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>

An Octopus card may store a maximum value of HK$1,000,<ref name="Clark" /> with an On-Loan card having an initial deposit value of HK$50 and a Sold card having no initial deposit value.  Negative value is incurred on a card if it is used with insufficient funds—both types of cards may carry a maximum negative value of HK$35 before value needs to be added to them again for use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/type.jsp#faq1|title=FAQ: What is the difference between On-loan Octopus and Sold Octopus?|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>  The maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the Airport Express and first class of the MTR East Rail line is HK$34.8.<ref>{{cite web

The Octopus Automatic Add Value Service (AAVS) is another method by which cardholders may add value to their cards.  This service allows for money to be automatically deducted from a credit card and added to an Octopus card when the value of the Octopus card is less than zero dollars.  The credit card used must be one offered by one of 22 financial institutions that participate in AAVS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/payment/reload/en/aavs.jsp|title=Automatic Add Value Service|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref>  Participating banks include [[HSBC]], [[Bank of China (Hong Kong)|Bank of China]], and [[Hang Seng Bank]].  HK$250 is added to the card each time value is automatically added; six participating financial institutions offer an option of adding a value of HK$500 instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/payment/reload/en/financialinst.jsp|title=List of Participating Financial Institutions|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref>

An Octopus card may be returned to any MTR Customer Service Centre for a refund of the remaining value stored on it.  A handling fee may be charged for the refund; HK$7 for an anonymous On-Loan card that had been in use for fewer than three months, and HK$10 for a ''Personalised'' On-Loan card that was issued on or after [[1 November]] [[2004]].  A refund is immediately provided at the time an anonymous On Loan card is returned, unless it has more than HK$500 stored on it.  A ''Personalised'' On-Loan card or an anonymous On-Loan card with more than HK$500 stored on it needs to be sent back to Octopus Cards Limited for refund processing, in which case, the refund for a ''Personalised'' On-Loan card would be available in eight days, and that of an anonymous On-Loan card would be available in five days.  If a damaged card is returned for refund, a HK$30 levy would be charged to the cardholder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/refund.jsp|title=FAQ: Refund Procedures|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref>

==Technology==
[[Image:Octopus reader.jpg|thumb|250px|An Octopus reader on a bus operated by New World First Bus]]
The Octopus system was designed by [[Australia]]-based company [[ERG Group]].  The company was selected in 1994 to lead the development of the Octopus project and was responsible for the building and installation of the components of the Octopus system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erggroup.com/projects/hongkong.htm|title=Projects: Hong Kong|publisher=ERG Group|accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref>  Operations, maintenance and development was undertaken by Octopus Cards Limited, and in 2005, it replaced the central transaction clearing house with its own system.<ref name="HoldingsHistory" />

The Octopus card uses the [[Sony]] 13.56 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[FeliCa]] [[RFID|radio frequency identification]] (RFID) chip,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/374/1/1/|title=RFID Smart Cards Gain Ground|publisher=RFID Journal|date=[[2003-04-09]]|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> and Hong Kong is the home of the world's first major public transport system using this technology.<ref name=sony>{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Products/felica/pdf/data/FeliCa_E.pdf|title=FeliCa|publisher=Sony Corporation|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-11}}</ref>  This is a "touch and go" system, so users need only hold the card in close proximity of the reader, and thus physical contact is not required. Data is transmitted at up to 212 kbit/s (the maximum speed for Sony FeliCa chips), compared to 9.6 kbit/s for other smart card systems like [[Mondex]] and [[Visa Cash]].<ref name=sony />  The card has a storage capacity of 1 [[Kilobyte|KB]] to 64 KB compared to the 125 [[byte]]s provided by traditional magnetic stripe card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/knowledge/smarttech.html|title=Smart Card Technology|publisher=Hong Kong SAR Government Information Centre|date=[[2007-01-31]]|accessdate=2007-04-11}}</ref>

Octopus uses a nonstandard system for RFID instead of the [[ISO 14443]] standards, since there were no standards in the nascent industry during its development in 1997. The operating range of the reader/writer is between 30 and 100&nbsp;mm (1.18 and 3.94&nbsp;in) depending on the type of model being used.<ref name=knowledgebase />

Octopus is specifically designed so that card transactions are relayed for clearing on a [[store and forward]] basis, without any requirement for reader units to have [[realtime]] round-trip communications with a central database or computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-05/bh-us-05-mahaffey.pdf|title=Passive RFID Security|author=Kevin Mahaffey|publisher=BlackHat|pages=20|month=July|year=2005|accessdate=2007-04-11|format=PDF}}</ref>  The stored data about the transaction may be transmitted by network after hours, or in the case of offline mobile readers may be retrieved by a hand held device, for example a [[Pocket PC]].

In practice, different data collection mechanisms are used by different transport operators, depending on the nature of their business. The [[MTR]] equips its stations with [[local area network]]s that connect the components that deal with Octopus cards—[[turnstile]]s, Add Value Machines, value-checking machines and customer service terminals.  Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's [[Kowloon Bay (MTR)|Kowloon Bay]] headquarters through a [[frame relay]] [[wide area network]], and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing.<ref name=UNPAN>{{cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN007495.pdf|title=Integrated Transport and Land Use Planning as a Success Factor for Metros|author=Jack So|publisher=UNPAN|accessdate=2007-04-11|format=PDF}}</ref>  Similar arrangements are in place for retailers such as [[7-Eleven]]. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system, depending on operator.<ref name=UNPAN />

The Octopus card uses [[encryption]] for all airborne communication and it uses [[Mutual authentication|two-way authentication]] based on [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI).<ref name=bigchief>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigchief.com/whitepapers/rfid-world-2003-05-13.pdf|title=Security and Authentication Technologies|author=Peter Winer|publisher=Big Chief Partners, Inc.|pages=20|date=[[2003-05-13]]|accessdate=2007-04-11|format=PDF}}</ref>  In other words, data communications to and from the card are only established when mutually authenticated security handshaking is verified followed by transfer of encrypted data.  The Octopus card and system have never been successfully [[Hacker|hacked]].<ref name=bigchief />

==Operator==
{{main|Octopus Cards Limited}}
The Octopus card system is owned and operated by Octopus Cards Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Octopus Holdings Limited]].<ref name="HoldingsCompany">{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/company/en/index.jsp|title=Our Company|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref>  The company was founded as Creative Star Limited in 1994 to oversee the development and implementation of the Octopus card system, and was renamed as its current name of Octopus Cards Limited in 2002.<ref name="HoldingsHistory" />  Creative Star was formed as a joint-venture company by five major transit companies in Hong Kong—[[MTR Corporation]], [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]], [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]], and [[Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry]].  In January 2001, the shares of Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry in the company was transferred to [[New World First Bus]] and [[New World First Ferry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/investrelation/2003frpt_e/F131.pdf|title=Interest in non-controlled subsidiary|pages=27|publisher=MTR Corporation|accessdate=2007-04-24|format=PDF}}</ref>  In the same year, together with MTR Corporation, the company was transformed from its previous non-profit making status to a profit making enterprise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr06-07/english/sec/library/0607in08-e.pdf|title=Operation of the Octopus Card in Hong Kong|publisher=Legislative Council Secretariat|year=2007|accessdate=2007-04-25|format=PDF}}</ref>

Due to the expansion of the company's businesses, Octopus Holdings Limited was established in 2005 and Octopus Cards Limited was restructured as its subsidiary.  The business of Octopus Cards Limited, being a payment business, is regulated by the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]], while Octopus' non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings Limited that are independent of Octopus Cards Limited.<ref name="HoldingsCompany" />  As of 2007, Octopus Holdings Limited was a joint-venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 54.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/company/en/operators.jsp|title=The Joint Venture of Five Major Transport Operators|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref>  Since the [[Government of Hong Kong]] owns 76.54% of the MTR Corporation (as of [[31 December]] [[2005]]) and wholly owns the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/investrelation/shareholder_services.php|title=Investors' Information|publisher=MTR Corporation|accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcrc.com/html/eng/corporate/about_kcrc/history/index.asp|title=History|publisher=Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation|accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref> it is the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Holdings Limited, and thus also the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Cards Limited.

Initially, Octopus Cards Limited, then known as Creative Star Limited, was restricted to having at most 15 percent of Octopus card transactions for non-transport transactions, as it operated under the Hong Kong government's ''Banking Ordinance''.  On [[2000-04-20]], the Hong Kong Monetary Authority authorised the company for deposit-taking, which allowed for 50 percent of Octopus card transactions to be unrelated to transport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr00-01/english/hc/papers/ls-1.pdf|title=Legal Service Division Reports on Subsidiary Legislation tabled in the Legislative Council from 7 June to 26 June and on 4 October 2000|publisher=Legislative Council of the HKSAR|pages=36|date=2000-10-04|accessdate=2007-04-16|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="BIS" /> HK$416 million (US$53.3 million) is deposited in the Octopus system at any given time as of 2000.<ref>{{cite web

==Taxis==
Although a popular form of transport, [[Taxicabs of Hong Kong|taxis in Hong Kong]] do not accept the Octopus card.  On [[27 June]] [[2006]], after 10 years of negotiations between Octopus Cards Limited and the taxi industry, the first trial of taxis equipped with Octopus card readers was launched in the [[New Territories]] with taxis operated by the Yellow Taxi Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20060627.jsp|title=Octopus To Be Used In Hong Kong By First Batch of Taxis|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=[[2006-06-27]]|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>  But it was reported on [[30 October]] that of the 20 taxis that participated in the trial, eight had dropped out.  Part of the reason was technical—drivers must return to the office every day for accounting.  The Octopus card company said it would be upgrading the system to allow automatic account updating in the future.<ref name="TaxiSetback">{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/node_10/node_37/node_83/2006/10/31/116225881510438.shtml|title=Setback for Octopus Card Trial in Taxis in HK|publisher=Life of GuangZhou|date=[[2006-10-30]]|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>  Wong Yu-ting, managing director of the Yellow Taxi Group, also noted that they had been "trying to convince restaurants and retailers" to offer discounts to Octopus taxi passengers, but the [[Transport Department (Hong Kong)|Transport Department]] had been a major obstacle.  The Transport Department is against this approach for legal reasons.<ref name="TaxiSetback" />

==Alternate forms==
[[Image:Octopus Mini.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An key-chain alternate form of the Octopus Card]] 
Other than the Octopus card itself, operator Octopus Cards Limited also sells watches and mobile phone covers that function as an anonymous Octopus card.  The types of watches available include wrist watches, pocket watches, and watch key chains.  The mobile phone covers were specifically designed for [[Nokia]] models [[Nokia 3310|3310]] and [[Nokia 3330|3330]].<ref name=OtherProd>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/other/en/index.jsp|title=Other Octopus Products|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>  As with the card itself, these products are used by waving them over a card reader.  They may be reloaded with money value the same way as the card itself, including automatic reloading via the Automatic Add Value Service, with the exception that they cannot be reloaded at Add Value Machines due to their shapes.<ref name=FAQOther>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/other.jsp|title=FAQ: Other Octopus Products|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>  An Octopus watch or mobile phone cover may be stored with a maximum of HK$1,000, but do not have any initial stored value at the time of its purchase.  It may have a maximum negative value of HK$35 as with an Octopus card.<ref name=OtherProd />  These products are not refundable for their costs, but the remaining value stored on them may be refunded if they are damaged, with the damaged product itself also returned to the customer.<ref name=FAQOther />

In June 2007, a new set of limited edition products was announced, featuring Mini Octopus cards and Child Octopus Wristbands. The Mini Octopus cards, available in Adult and Elder editions, measure 4.7&nbsp;cm by 3&nbsp;cm (1.85&nbsp;in by 1.18&nbsp;in) and work as regular (anonymous) Adult and Elder, respectively, Octopus cards. The Child Octopus Wristbands are plastic wristbands with a watch-like round face and work as regular Child Octopus cards.<ref name=Mini>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20070614.jsp|title=Mini Octopus|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> The same value-adding abilities and limitations as the aforementioned watches and mobile phone apply.

==Outside Hong Kong==
Usage of the Octopus card was extended to the Chinese cities of [[Shenzhen]] and [[Macau]] in 2006.  In collaboration with [[China UnionPay]], Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two [[Fairwood (restaurant)|Fairwood restaurants]] in Shenzhen in August 2006.<ref name="Shenzhen">{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20060814.jsp|title=Octopus Joins Forces with Fairwood and China UnionPay to Introduce Octopus to Shenzhen|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=[[2006-08-14]]|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref>  Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer's credit card to reload an Octopus card.  In using an Octopus card, the currency [[exchange rate]] between [[mainland China]]'s [[renminbi]] and the Hong Kong dollar is RMB1:HKD1.<ref name="Shenzhen" />  The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus card payments are located at [[Luohu Commercial City]] and [[Shenzhen Railway Station]].<ref name="Shenzhen" />  Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment.  In Macau, the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in the city adopted its usage as payment.  Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the [[Macanese pataca]] and the Hong Kong dollar when using an Octopus card is MOP1:HKD1.<ref name="Macau">{{cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20061210.jsp|title=Octopus Extends to Macau with First Acceptance of Octopus Payments at KFC|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=[[2006-12-10]]|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref>  The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the [[List of roads in Macau|Rua De Campo]] and the [[Sands Macau|Sands Casino]].<ref name="Macau" />

==EPS add-value glitch==

In February 2007, it was found that when customers added value to their cards at self-service add-value points located in MTR and KCR stations, their bank accounts would be debited even if the transactions were cancelled.<ref name="EPS1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20070204/news_20070204_56_376306.htm|title=MTR and KCR Octopus EPS Add-Value Services suspended|publisher=RTHK News|date=[[2007-02-04]]|accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref> Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems. Initially, two cases were reported.  The company then announced that the use of the payment system, [[Electronic Payment Services]] (EPS), in add-value service points would be suspended until further notice, and had started investigation of the system's mistake.<ref name="EPS2">{{cite web|url=http://gbcode.rthk.org.hk/gb/app2.rthk.org.hk/pda/news/content.php?id=379458|title=Octopus company ordered to submit auditor's report after complaints over EPS add-value losses|publisher=RTHK News|date=[[2007-02-17]]|accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>

On [[27 July]] [[2007]], a report was announced that the wrong transactions could be traced back to 2000, and a total of 3.7 million Hong Kong dollars was wrongly deducted from 15,270 cases. The company reported that there may be cases dating before 2000, because only transactions from the past seven years were kept.  It stated that it would co-operate with EPS Company Limited, operator of Electronic Payment Services, and banks to contact customers involved and arrange a refund within ten weeks' time.<ref name="EPS3">{{cite web|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20070727/news_20070727_56_419225.htm|title= Octopus Card company to refund customers|publisher=RTHK News|date=[[2007-07-27]]|accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>
