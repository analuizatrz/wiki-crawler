The nation was founded by [[thirteen colonies]] that declared their independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] on [[July 4]], [[1776]], and were recognized by France and other European powers in 1778.  The United States has existed continuously as a united, sovereign, national state since it adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], on [[March 1]], [[1781]]. The nation's form of government was significantly altered when it adopted the current [[United States Constitution|constitution]] on [[September 17]], [[1787]].  [[American people|American]] [[Military of the United States|military]], [[Economy of the United States|economic]], [[Culture of the United States|cultural]], and [[Politics of the United States|political]] influence increased through the [[19th century|19th]] and [[20th century|20th centuries]]. With the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] at the end of the [[Cold War]], the U.S. emerged as the world's sole remaining [[superpower]],<ref>[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20040701faessay83406/eliot-a-cohen/history-and-the-hyperpower.html History and the Hyperpower by Eliot A. Cohen]. July/August 2004. [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. ''URL accessed July 14, 2006.''</ref> greatly influencing world affairs, as it continues to do today.

==Etymology==
Common names and abbreviations of the United States of America include the '''United States''', the '''U.S.''', the '''U.S.A.''', the '''USA''', the '''U.S. of A.''', '''the States''' (informal), and '''America'''.
The earliest known use of the name ''[[America (disambiguation)|America]]'' is attributed to the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] cartographer [[Martin Waldseemüller]] who, while working in [[Saint-Dié-des-Vosges]] in 1507, created a globe and a large map showing North and South America.<ref>The Waldseemüller map [http://bell.lib.umn.edu/map/WALD/WALL/indexww.html] labeled North America as "terra incognita" ([http://bell.lib.umn.edu/map/WALD/WALL/north.html closeup]) and South America as "America." ([http://bell.lib.umn.edu/map/WALD/WALL/south.html closeup])  The map does not show the continents to be connected. ([http://bell.lib.umn.edu/map/WALD/WALL/lgwall.html closeup])</ref> Although the origin of the name is uncertain,<ref>[http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html Theories on the origin of America's name]</ref> the most widely held belief is that expressed in an accompanying book{{fact}}, ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', which explains it as the [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] version of the [[Latin]] name of Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] (''Americus Vespucius''); in Latin, the other continents' names were all feminine. Vespucci theorized, correctly, that [[Christopher Columbus]], on reaching islands in the [[Caribbean Sea]] in 1492, had come not to [[India]] but to a "[[New World]]".

The [[Americas]] were also known as ''[[Historical Columbia|Columbia]],'' after Columbus, prompting the name ''District of Columbia'' for the land set aside as the U.S. capital. ''Columbia'' remained a popular name for the United States until the early 20th century, when it fell into relative disuse; it is still used poetically, and appears in various names and titles.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/home/index.html Space Shuttle Columbia]. [[NASA]]. ''URL accessed [[December 9]], [[2006]].''</ref><ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/columbiabroa/columbiabroa.htm Columbia Broadcasting System]. The [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]. ''URL accessed [[December 9]], [[2006]].''</ref><ref>[http://www.reelclassics.com/Studios/Columbia/columbia.htm Columbia Pictures]. Reel Classics. ''URL accessed [[December 9]], [[2006]].''</ref> One female [[National personification|personification]] of the country is called ''Columbia''; she is similar to [[Britannia]].<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cocoon/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200000004/default.html Columbia the Gem of the Ocean]. Patriotic Melodies (The [[Library of Congress]]). ''URL accessed [[December 9]], [[2006]].''</ref> [[Columbus Day]] is a holiday in the United States, and other countries in the Americas, commemorating Columbus' October [[1492]] landing.

The phrase <!--NOTE: Declaration has "united", NOT "United"-->"united States of America" was first used officially in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], adopted on [[July 4]], [[1776]]. On [[November 15]], [[1777]], the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first of which stated "The Stile ''[sic]'' of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'" The name was originally proposed by [[Thomas Paine]].	

The most common [[adjectival]] and [[demonym]]ic form for the United States is ''[[American (disambiguation)|American]];'' this term is used for U.S. citizens living abroad, and for cultural characteristrics ("American language," "American sports") and is rarely used to refer to people not connected to the U.S.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the United States}}
[[Image:MtHood TrilliumLake.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Mount Hood]], a dormant volcano in the [[Pacific Northwest]].]]The United States is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|world's third largest country]] by total area, and the third largest by land area alone, after [[Russia]] and  [[Canada]].<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html Rank Order - Area]. 2 November 2006. CIA World Factbook. ''URL accessed 13 November 2006.''</ref> Its [[Continental United States|contiguous portion]] is bounded by the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, the North [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, [[Mexico]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and Canada to the north. The state of [[Alaska]] also borders Canada, with the Pacific Ocean to its south, the [[Arctic Ocean]] to its north, and the [[Bering Strait]] to the west. The state of [[Hawaii]] occupies an [[archipelago]] in the Pacific Ocean, southwest of the [[North America]]n mainland.

[[Deciduous]] vegetation and [[grassland]]s prevail in the eastern U.S., transitioning to [[prairies]], [[taiga|boreal]] forests, and the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the west, and [[desert]]s in the southwest. In the northeast, the coasts of the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Atlantic seaboard]] host much of the country's population.

===Terrain===
The U.S. has an extremely varied geography, particularly in the [[Western United States|West]]. The eastern seaboard has a [[coastal plain]] which is widest in the south and narrows in the north. The coastal plain does not exist north of [[New Jersey]], although there are glacial [[outwash]] plains on [[Long Island]], [[Martha's Vineyard]], and [[Nantucket]]. In the extreme southeast, [[Florida]] is home to the ecologically unique [[Everglades]]. 

Beyond the coastal plain, the rolling hills of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region end at the [[Appalachian Mountains]], which rise above 6,000&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (1,830&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) in [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[New Hampshire]]. From the west slope of the Appalachians, the [[Interior Plains]] of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] are relatively flat and are the location of the [[Great Lakes]] as well as the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]-[[Missouri River]], the world's [[List of rivers by length|4th longest river system]].<ref>[http://www.visitbemidji.com/index.html Mississippi River]. 2004. Visit Bemidji- First City on the Mississippi. ''URL accessed May 3, 2006.''</ref> West of the Mississippi River, the Interior Plains slope uphill and blend into the vast and often featureless [[Great Plains]]. 

The abrupt rise of the [[Rocky Mountains]], at the western edge of the Great Plains, extends north to south across the continental U.S., reaching altitudes over 14,000&nbsp;feet (4,270&nbsp;m) in [[Colorado]].<ref>Peakbagger.com, [http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=21360 Colorado 14,000-foot Peaks], ''URL accessed May 3, 2006.''</ref> In the past, the Rocky Mountains had a higher level of volcanic activity; nowadays, the range only has one area of [[volcano|volcanism]] (the [[supervolcano]] underlying [[Yellowstone National Park]] in [[Wyoming]], possibly the world's largest volcano), although [[rift]] volcanism has occurred relatively recently near the Rockies' southern margin in [[New Mexico]].<ref>Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program, [http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/region.cfm?rnum=1210 New Mexico volcanoes], ''URL accessed August 26, 2006.''</ref> 

Alaska has numerous mountain ranges; including [[Mount McKinley]] (Denali), the highest peak in North America. Numerous volcanoes can be found throughout the [[Alexander Archipelago|Alexander]] and [[Aleutian Islands]] extending south and west of the Alaskan mainland. 

The Hawaiian islands are [[Hawaiian islands|tropical, volcanic islands]] extending over 1,500&nbsp;[[mile]]s (2,400&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]), and consisting of six larger islands and another dozen smaller ones that are inhabited.

===Climate===

[[Image:Climatemapusa.JPG|thumb|right|Climate zones of the lower 48 United States.]]
Due to its large size and wide range of geographic features, the United States contains examples of nearly every global climate.  The climate is temperate in most areas, tropical in [[Hawaii]] and southern [[Florida]], polar in [[Alaska]], semiarid in the [[Great Plains]] west of the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]], Mediterranean in coastal [[California]] and arid in the [[Great Basin]].  Its comparatively generous climate contributed (in part) to the country's rise as a world power, with infrequent [[Drought|severe drought]] in the major agricultural regions, a general lack of widespread flooding, and a mainly [[Temperate|temperate climate]] that receives adequate precipitation.

==History==
{{main|History of the United States}}
===Native Americans===
Before the [[European colonization of the Americas]], a process that began at the end of the 15th century, the present-day continental U.S. was inhabited exclusively by various [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]], including [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan natives]], who migrated to the [[North America|continent]] over a period that may have begun 35,000 years ago and may have ended as recently as [[9th millennium BC|11,000 years ago]].<ref>[http://www.si.edu/resource/faq/nmnh/origin.htm "Paleoamerican Origins"]. 1999. [[Smithsonian Institution]]. ''Accessed 2 May 2006.''</ref>

===European colonization===
[[Image:MayflowerHarbor.jpg|left|250px|thumb|'''The ''Mayflower'' in Plymouth Harbor,''' painted by William Halsall, 1882.  the ''[[Mayflower]]'' transported [[Pilgrims]] to the New World in 1620.]]
The first confirmed European landing in present-day United States territory was by [[Christopher Columbus]], who visited [[Puerto Rico]] on [[November 19]], [[1493]], during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|second voyage]]. The settlement of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]] was founded on [[August 8]], [[1508]] by [[Juan Ponce de León]]. Ponce de León went on to become the first confirmed European to arrive in what would become the [[continental United States]] when he landed in [[Florida]] on [[April 2]], [[1513]]. Florida was home to the earliest European colonies on the mainland; these were [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] (founded by [[Tristán de Luna y Arellano]] in 1559), [[Fort Caroline]] (by [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière]] in 1564), and [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] (by [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]] in 1565), the last of which is the only one to have been continuously inhabited since its foundation.

[[France|French]] [[colonization|colonists]] explored and settled parts of the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Mississippi Valley]] regions, while the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colonized much of what became the [[Southwestern United States]], along with Florida. The first successful [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlement was at [[Virginia Colony|Jamestown]], [[Virginia]], in 1607, followed in 1620 by the [[Pilgrims]]' landing at [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts]], then the arrival of the colony of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]], started by the [[Puritan]]s. In 1609 and 1617, respectively, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[New Amsterdam|settled]] in part of what became [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. In 1638, the [[Sweden|Swedes]] founded [[New Sweden]], in part of what became [[Delaware]], New Jersey, and [[Pennsylvania]] after passing through Dutch hands. Throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries, England (and later Great Britain) established new colonies, took over Dutch colonies, and split others. With the division of the [[Carolinas]] in 1729, and the colonization of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1732, the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies]] in North America&mdash;excluding present-day Canada, and the loyal colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]&mdash;numbered thirteen.

===American Revolution and Early Republic===

{{main|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War}}

Tensions between [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonials]] and the British during the [[American Revolution|revolutionary period]] of the 1760s and 1770s led to open [[American Revolutionary War|military conflict]] in 1775. [[George Washington]] commanded the [[Continental Army]] during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) as the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the Declaration of Independence on [[July 4]], [[1776]]. The Congress had been formed to confront British actions and created the Continental Army, but it did not have the authority to levy [[tax]]es or make federal laws. In 1777, the Congress adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], uniting the states under a weak federal government, which operated from 1781 until 1788. Dissatisfaction with the strength of the national government led to a constitutional convention in 1787. By June of 1788, enough states had ratified the [[United States Constitution]] to establish the new government, which took office in 1789. The Constitution, which strengthened the union and the federal government, has since remained the supreme law of the land.<ref>Yanak, Ted and Cornelison, Pam.

===Westward expansion===
{{main|Manifest Destiny}}
[[Image:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|left|176px|thumb|National Atlas map depicting dates of select territorial acquisitions. Full Oregon and other claims are not included.]]
From 1803 to 1848, the size of the new nation nearly tripled as settlers (many embracing the concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] as an inevitable consequence of [[American exceptionalism]]) pushed beyond national boundaries even before the [[Louisiana Purchase]].<ref>[http://eps.berkeley.edu/~brimhall/EPS170AC_LNS170AC/L-20.pdf Manifest Destiny- An interpretation of How the West was Won]. Crossroads of Earth Resources and Society. URL accessed on 4 May 2006.</ref> The expansion was tempered somewhat by the stalemate in the [[War of 1812]], but it was subsequently reinvigorated by victory in the [[Mexican-American War]] in [[1848]].

Between 1830-1880 up to 40 million [[American Bison|American Buffalo]] were slaughtered for skins and meat, and to aid railway expansion.  The expansion of the railways reduced transit times for both goods and people, made [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]] less arduous for the pioneers, and increased conflicts with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] over the land and its uses.  The loss of the buffalo, a primary resource for the plains Indians, added to the pressures on native cultures and individuals for survival.

===Civil War===

{{main|American Civil War}}
As new territories were being incorporated, the nation was divided over the issue of [[states' rights]], the role of the federal government, and&mdash;by the 1820s&mdash;the expansion of [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]], which had been legal in all thirteen colonies but was rarer in the north, where it was abolished by 1804. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Northern states]] were opposed to the expansion of slavery whereas the Southern states saw the opposition as an attack on their [[way of life]], since their economy was dependent on slave labor. The failure to permanently resolve these issues led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], following the secession of many [[slave state]]s in the South to form the [[Confederate States of America]] after the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Morrison, Michael A ''Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War''.

ISBN 0-8078-4796-8.</ref> The 1865 Union victory in the Civil War effectively ended slavery and settled the question of whether a state had the right to secede.

===Reconstruction and industrialization===
[[Image:Ellis island 1902.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Immigrants landing at [[Ellis Island]]]]
{{main|Reconstruction}}
After the Civil War, an unprecedented influx of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]], who helped to provide labor for American industry and create diverse communities in [[American Old West|undeveloped areas]]&mdash;together with high tariff protections, national infrastructure building, and national banking regulations&mdash;hastened the country's rise to [[Power in international relations|international power]]. The growing power of the United States enabled it to acquire new territories, including the annexation of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Philippines]] after victory in the [[Spanish-American War]],<ref>Spielvogel, Jackson J.

===World Wars I and II===

{{main|World War I|World War II}}
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the United States remained neutral. In 1917, however, the United States joined the [[Triple Entente|Allied Powers]], helping to turn the tide against the [[Central Powers]]. For historical reasons, American sympathies were very much in favor of the British and French, even though a sizable number of citizens, mostly Irish and German, were opposed to intervention.<ref>Eric Foner and [[John A. Garraty]], ''The Reader's Companion to American History.'' Page 576. 21 October 1991. Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0-395-51372-3.</ref> After the war, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] did not ratify the [[Treaty of Versailles]] because of a fear that it would pull the United States into European affairs. Instead, the country continued to pursue its policy of [[unilateralism]] that bordered at times on [[isolationism]].<ref>McDuffie, Jerome, Piggrem, Gary Wayne, and Woodworth, Steven E. ''U.S. History Super Review''. Page 418. Research & Education Association: 21 June 2005. ISBN 0-7386-0070-9</ref> 

During [[Roaring Twenties|most of the 1920s]], the United States enjoyed a period of unbalanced prosperity as farm prices fell and industrial profits grew. A rise in debt and an inflated [[stock market]] culminated in a [[Stock market crash|crash]] in 1929, and combined with the [[Dust Bowl]], triggered the [[Great Depression]]. After his election as [[President of the United States|President]] in 1932, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] instituted his plan for a [[New Deal]], which increased [[Public sector|government intervention]] in the economy in response to the Great Depression.

The nation did not fully recover until 1941, when the United States was driven to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] against the [[Axis Powers]] after a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by [[Japan]]. [[World War II]] was the costliest war in economic terms in American history,<ref>[http://www.ddaymuseum.org/education/education_numbers.html World War II By The Numbers].  The National WWII Museum, New Orleans.  Last accessed October 24, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0829/p15s01-cogn.html More costly than 'the war to end all wars'].  David R. Francis, ''[[Christian Science Monitor]].''  [[August 29, 2005]]. Last accessed October 24, 2006.</ref> but it helped to pull the economy out of depression because the required production of military [[materiel]] provided much-needed jobs, and women entered the workforce in large numbers for the first time. During this war, [[Manhattan Project|scientists]] working for the United States federal government succeeded in producing [[nuclear weapons]], making the United States the world's first [[nuclear power]]. Toward the end of World War II, after the [[end of World War II in Europe]], the United States dropped [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], Japan. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs were the second and third nuclear devices detonated and the only ones ever employed as weapons.

[[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] soon after, on [[2 September]] [[1945]], which ended World War II.<ref>Walker, John F, and Vatter, Harold G ''The Rise of Big Government in the United States.'' Page 63. M.E. Sharpe: [[1997|May 1997]]. ISBN 0-7656-0067-6.</ref>

===Cold War and civil rights===
{{main|Cold War|American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)}}
After World War II, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] became superpowers in an era of ideological rivalry dubbed the [[Cold War]]. The United States officially promoted [[liberal democracy]] and [[capitalism]], while the Soviet Union officially promoted [[communism]] and a centrally [[planned economy]]. Both sides sometimes supported politically convenient oppressive regimes. The result was a series of [[proxy war]]s, including the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], the tense nuclear showdown of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]].

The perception that the United States was losing the [[space race]] spurred government efforts to raise proficiency in mathematics and science in schools<ref name="Rudolph">Rudolph, John L. ''Scientists in the Classroom: The Cold War Reconstruction of American Science Education.'' Page 1. Palgrave Macmillan: 3 May 2002. ISBN 0-312-29571-5.</ref> and led to President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call for the United States to land "a man on the [[moon]]" by the end of the 1960s, which was realized in 1969.<ref name="Rudolph">Rudolph, John L. ''Scientists in the Classroom: The Cold War Reconstruction of American Science Education.'' Page 1. Palgrave Macmillan: 3 May 2002. ISBN 0-312-29571-5.</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Culture of the United States|American society]] experienced a period of sustained economic expansion. At the same time, discrimination across the United States, especially in the South, was increasingly challenged by a growing [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil-rights movement]] headed by prominent [[African American]]s such as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], which led to the abolition of the [[Jim Crow laws]] in the South.<ref>Klarman, Michael J. ''From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality.'' Page 552. [[Oxford University Press]], USA: 4 May 2006. ISBN 0-19-531018-7.</ref>

After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the United States continued to intervene in overseas military conflicts such as the [[Gulf War]]. It remains the world's only superpower.

===September 11, 2001 and the War on Terrorism===
{{main|September 11, 2001 attacks|War on Terror}} 
On [[September 11]] [[2001]], 19 [[al-Qaeda]] operatives [[hijacked]] four commercial airplanes.  Two were flown into the [[World Trade Center]] towers in [[New York City]], while a third crashed into [[The Pentagon]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].  The fourth plane was brought down near [[Shanksville]], [[Pennsylvania]] during a struggle between the passengers and hijackers. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]], [[Foreign relations of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] focused on the global threat of [[terrorism]] and the U.S. government under [[President]] [[George W. Bush]] began a series of military and legal operations termed the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]. The War on Terror began on [[October 7]], [[2001]] when a U.S.-led coalition launched [[military operation]]s in [[Afghanistan]] which led to the removal of the [[Taliban]] rule and the expulsion of the terrorist organization [[al-Qaeda]] and its leader [[Osama Bin Laden]].<!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS WORD WITHOUT FIRST DISCUSSING IT--> The events of [[September 11]] led to a preemptive policy against threats to U.S. security, known as [[Bush Doctrine|the Bush Doctrine]]. 

In the [[2002]] [[State of the Union]] address, President George W. Bush labeled [[North Korea]], [[Iraq]], and [[Iran]] "the [[axis of evil]]," and stated that these countries "constitute a grave threat to the security of the U.S. and its allies." Later that year, the Bush administration began to press for [[regime change]] in [[Iraq]]. After many failed U.N. resolutions and [[Saddam Hussein]] rejecting demands to surrender, the United States and its allies [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded Iraq]] in March 2003. The Bush administration justified its invasion with a charge that Iraq had stockpiled [[weapons of mass destruction]], and was seeking nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite press release

==Government and politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Federal government of the United States|Politics of the United States}}
[[Image:USCapitol.jpg|thumb|250px|right|West Front of the [[United States Capitol]].]]
=== Political system ===
The United States is the longest-surviving extant [[constitutional republic]], with the oldest wholly written [[constitution]] in the world. Its government relies on [[representative democracy]] through a [[congressional system]] under a set of powers specified by its [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].  However, it is "not a simple representative democracy, but a constitutional republic in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law."<ref>Scheb, John M. and John M. II. ''An Introduction to the American Legal System''. ISBN 0-7668-2759-3. Delmar Publishers. 2002. p. 6</ref> There are three levels of government, consisting of the federal, state, and local levels. Officials at all three levels are either elected by voters in a [[secret ballot]] or appointed by other [[Official|elected officials]]. Executive and legislative offices are decided by a [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]] of citizens in their respective districts, with judicial and cabinet-level offices nominated by the Executive branch and approved by the Legislature. In some states, judicial posts are filled by popular election rather than executive appointment.

The federal government comprises three branches, which are designed to [[checks and balances|check and balance]] one another's powers:
*[[legislature|Legislative]]: The [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], made up of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which makes [[federal law]], declares war, approves treaties and has powers of [[impeachment]].
*[[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of the United States|President]], who appoints, with Senate approval, the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and other officers, who administers and enforces federal law, can veto bills, and is [[Commander-in-Chief|Commander in Chief]] of the military.
*[[Judiciary]]: The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and lower [[federal court]]s, whose judges are appointed by the President with Senate approval, which interpret laws and their validity under the Constitution and can overturn laws they deem unconstitutional.

The United States Congress is a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature. The House of Representatives has 435 members, each representing a [[congressional district]] for a two-year term. House seats are [[United States Congressional apportionment|apportioned]] among the [[U.S. state|states]] according to [[population]] every tenth year. Each state is guaranteed at least one representative: seven states have one each; [[California]], the most populous state, has 53. Each state has two senators, elected [[At-Large|at large]] to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every second year.

[[Image:Whitehousetour.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The north side of the White House]]

The [[United States Constitution]] is the supreme legal document in the American system, and serves as a [[social contract]] between the people of the United States and their government. All laws and procedures of both state and federal governments are subject to review, and any law ruled to violate the Constitution by the judicial branch is overturned. The Constitution is a living document as it can be amended by a variety of methods, all of which require the approval of an overwhelming majority of the states. The Constitution has been amended 27 times, the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|last time]] in [[1992]].

The Constitution contains a dedication to "preserve [[liberty]]" with a "[[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" and other [[United States Constitution#Amendments|amendments]], which guarantee [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], and [[freedom of the press|the press]]; the [[right to a fair trial]]; [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|the right to keep and bear arms]]; [[universal suffrage]]; and [[Property|property rights]]. However, the extent to which these rights are protected and universal in practice is heavily debated. The Constitution also guarantees to every State "a [[Republic|Republican Form of Government]]". However, the meaning of that guarantee has been only slightly explicated.<ref>http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/article04/</ref>

American politics is dominated by the [[Republican Party of the United States]] and the [[Democratic Party of the United States]]. Members of these two parties hold the overwhelming majority of elected offices across the country at federal, state, and lower levels. Independent or so-called "third party" candidates tend to do better in lower-level elections, although they are presently some independent members of both the House and Senate. Within American political culture the Republican Party is considered "center-right" or [[conservative]] while the Democratic Party is considered "center-left" or [[liberal]]. The size of both parties has allowed for considerable divergence of views within both parties.

Since 2001, the President has been [[George W. Bush]], a Republican. Following the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]], the Democratic Party holds a majority of seats in both the House and Senate for the first time since 1994, except for a Democratic plurality in the Senate in 2001–02.<ref>Secretary of the Senate.

The United States has vast economic, political, and military influence on a global scale, which makes its foreign policy a subject of great interest and discussion around the world. Almost all countries have [[List of Washington, D.C. embassies|embassies]] in Washington, D.C., and [[Consul (representative)|consulate]]s around the country. However, [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], and [[Sudan]] do not have formal [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with the United States.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/INS/e0304/results.htm "Table 2 Aliens From Countries That Sponsor Terrorism Who Were Ordered Removed - 1 October 2000 through 31 December 2001"].

''URL accessed May 30, 2006''.</ref> The United States is a founding member of the [[United Nations]] (with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]), among many other [[international organizations]].

The United States has a long-standing tradition of civilian control over military affairs. The [[Department of Defense]] administers the U.S. [[armed forces]], which comprise the [[United States Army|Army]], the [[United States Navy|Navy]], the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], and the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]. The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] in [[Peace|peacetime]] but is placed under the [[Department of the Navy]] in times of [[war]].
The military of the United States comprises 1.4 million [[personnel]] on [[active duty]],<ref>[http://www.dior.whs.mil/mmid/military/ms9.pdf "Active Duty Military Personnel Strength Levels"]. 2002.

Service in the military is voluntary, though [[conscription]] may occur in times of war through the [[Selective Service System]]. The United States is considered to have the most powerful military in the world, partly because of the size of its [[Military budget|defense budget]]; [[Military budget of the United States|American defense expenditures]] in 2005 were estimated to be greater than the next 14 largest national military budgets combined,<ref>Anup Shah, [http://www.globalissues.org/Geopolitics/ArmsTrade/Spending.asp High Military Expenditure in Some Places].

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Political divisions of the United States}}

The United States of America consists of 50 states and one federal district, the District of Columbia. The conterminous, or contiguous, forty-eight states—all the states but [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]]—are also called the [[continental United States]] or the "lower 48" and occupy much of central North America. Alaska is separated from the "lower forty-eight" by Canada, and Hawaii, the fiftieth state, occupies an [[archipelago]] in the Pacific Ocean.

The following map presents the 50 states, additional territories and highlights the United States census regions of them:

The United States also holds several other territories. [[Palmyra Atoll]] is the United States' only [[incorporated territory]]; but it is [[Unorganized territory|unorganized]] and uninhabited. The [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]] consist of uninhabited islands and [[atoll]]s in the Pacific and [[Caribbean Sea]]. In addition, since 1898, the United States Navy has held an extensive [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|naval base]] at [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantánamo Bay]], [[Cuba]]. 

In addition to the actual states and territories of the United States, there are also nations which are [[associated state]]s of the U.S. The [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (since 1986), the [[Marshall Islands]] (since 1986), and [[Palau]] (since 1994) are associated with the United States under what is known as the [[Compact of Free Association]], giving the states international sovereignty and ultimate control over their territory. However, the governments of those areas have agreed to allow the United States to provide defense and financial assistance.

==Environment==
The U.S. has over 17,000 identified native plant and tree species, including 5,000 just in California (which is home to the [[Sequoia|tallest]], the [[Sequoiadendron|most massive]], and the [[Bristlecone pine|oldest]] trees in the world).<ref>Morse, Larry E., et al, [http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/j085.htm Native Vascular Plants], ''Our Living Resources, U.S. Department of the Interior'', ''URL accessed 14 June 2006.''</ref> With habitats ranging from tropical to arctic, the flora of the U.S. is the most diverse of any country; yet, thousands of non-native [[exotic species|exotic]] species sometimes adversely affect indigenous plant and animal communities. Over 400 species of mammal, 700 species of bird, 500 species of reptile and amphibian, and 90,000 species of insect have been documented.<ref>National Biological Service, [http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/index.htm Our Living Resources], ''URL accessed 14 June 2006.''</ref> Many plants and animals are very localized in their distribution, and some are in danger of extinction. The U.S. passed the [[Endangered Species Act]] in 1973 to protect native plant and animal species and their habitats.

Conservation has a long history in the U.S.; in 1872, the world's first [[National Park]] was established at [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]]. Another 57 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks and forests have since been designated.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/applications/release/Detail.cfm?ID=639 National Park Service Announces Addition of Two New Units], ''National Park Service News release'' (28 [[February 2006]]), ''URL accessed 13 June 2006.''</ref> In some parts of the country, [[wilderness]] areas have been established to ensure long-term protection of pristine habitats. The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] monitors [[endangered species|endangered]] and [[threatened species|threatened]] species and has set aside numerous areas for species and habitat preservation. Altogether, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] regulates 1,020,779 square miles (2,643,807&nbsp;km²), which is 28.8% of the total land area of the U.S.<ref>Republican Study Committee, [http://johnshadegg.house.gov/rsc/Federal%20Land%20Ownership--May%202005.pdf Federal Land and Buildings Ownership], (19 [[May 2005]]), ''URL accessed 13 June 2006.''</ref> The bulk of this land is protected park and forestland, but some is leased for [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] exploration, [[mining]], and cattle ranching.

The economy is fueled by an abundance in [[natural resource]]s such as [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[precious metal]]s. However, the country depends on foreign countries for much of its energy.

The [[social mobility]] of U.S. residents relative to that of other countries is the subject of much debate. Some analysts have found that social mobility in the United States is low relative to other [[OECD]] states, specifically compared to [[Western Europe]], [[Scandinavia]] and [[Canada]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3518560 "Ever Higher Society, Ever Harder to Ascend: Whatever Happened to the Belief That Any American Could Get to the Top"] [[The Economist]].

===Innovation===
{{main|Science and technology in the United States}}
{{Missing information|about innovations from the private sector. In the U.S. most R&D (69%) is entirely private.}}
[[Image:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] takes off on a manned mission to space.]]
The United States is an influential country in scientific and technological research and the production of [[Technological innovations of the United States|innovative technological products]]. The bulk of Research and Development funding (69%) comes from the private sector, rather than from taxes.<ref>http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/science_technology/science.pdf Research and Development (R&D) Expenditures by Source and Objective: 1970 to 2003], U.S. National Science Foundation.</ref> During World War II, the U.S. led the allied program to develop the [[atomic bomb]], ushering in the [[atomic age]]. Beginning early the Cold War, the U.S. achieved successes in space science and technology, leading to a [[space race]] which led to rapid advances in [[rocketry]], [[weaponry]], [[material science]], [[computers]], and many other areas. This [[History of technology|technological progress]] was epitomized by the first visit of a man to the moon, when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped off of [[Apollo 11]] in July 1969.<ref>[http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/introduction.htm Apollo 30th Anniversary]. 20 September 2002. NASA. ''Accessed 2 May 2006.''</ref> The U.S. was also the most instrumental nation in the development of the [[Internet]], developing its predecessor, [[Arpanet]]. U.S. businesses control most of its infrastructure.

===Transportation===
{{main|Transportation in the United States}}
The automobile industry developed earlier and more rapidly in the United States than in most other countries. The backbone of the nation's transportation infrastructure is a network of high-capacity [[highway]]s which carry large numbers of both [[passenger car]]s and freight trucks. From data taken in 2004, there are about 3,981,521 [[mile]]s (6,407,637&nbsp;[[kilometer|km]]) of roadways in the U.S., the most in the world.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2085rank.html Rank Order- Roadways]. [[20 April]] [[2006]]. CIA World Factbook. Accessed [[30 April]] [[2006]].</ref>

[[Mass transit]] systems exist in large cities, such as [[Transportation in New York City|New York]], which operates one of the busiest [[Rapid transit|subway]] systems in the world. With a few exceptions, [[List of cities, towns, and villages in the United States|American cities]] are less dense than those in other parts of the world. Low density partly results from and largely necessitates [[automobile ownership]] by most households. The United States is also home to world's largest rail network.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2121rank.html</ref>

[[Air travel]] is the preferred [[Mode of transport|means of passenger travel]] for long distances. In terms of passengers, seventeen of the world's thirty busiest [[airports]] in 2004 were in the U.S., including the world's busiest, [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] (ATL). In terms of cargo, in the same year, twelve of the world's thirty busiest airports were in the U.S., including the world's busiest, [[Memphis International Airport]]. 

Several major [[seaport]]s are in the United States; the three busiest are California's [[Port of Los Angeles]] and [[Port of Long Beach]], and the [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal|Port of New York and New Jersey]], all among the [[world's busiest port|world's busiest]]. The interior of the U.S. also has major [[Channel (geography)|shipping channels]], via the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] and the Mississippi River. The first water link between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic, the [[Erie Canal]], allowed the rapid expansion of agriculture and industry in the Midwest and made New York City the economic center of the country.

===Indigenous peoples===
{{Main|Native Americans in the United States}}

The [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] gave [[United States nationality law|United States citizenship]] to Native Americans, in part because of an interest by many to see them merged with the American mainstream, and also because of the heroic service of many Native American veterans in the [[First World War]].

According to the 2003 census estimates, there are 2,786,652 Native Americans in the United States. However, numerous [[indigenous peoples]] from [[Latin America|Latin American countries]], particularly [[Mexico]], have migrated to the U.S. over the years.

===Religion===
[[Image:Pisgah.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pisgah Baptist Church in Four Oaks, [[North Carolina]]. The [[Bible Belt]] is well known for its large devout Protestant Christian population.]]
{{main|Religion in the United States}}
The United States government keeps no official register of Americans' religious status.<ref>http://www.census.gov/prod/www/religion.htm</ref> However, in a private survey conducted in 2001 and mentioned in the Census Bureau's ''Statistical Abstract of the United States'', 76.7% of American adults identified themselves as [[Christian]]; about 52% of adults described themselves as members of various [[Protestant]] denominations. [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Roman Catholics]], at 24.5%, were the most populous individual denomination.  The most popular other faiths include [[Judaism]] (1.4%), [[Islam]] (0.6%), [[Buddhism]] (0.5%), [[Hinduism]] (0.4%) and [[Unitarian Universalism]] (0.3%). About 14.2% of respondents described themselves as having no religion. The religious distribution of the 5.4% who elected not to describe themselves for the survey is unknown.<ref name=POP>[http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/population/pop.pdf Self-Described Religious Identification of Adult Population: 1990 and 2001]. U.S. Census Bureau's ''Statistical Abstract of the United States'', 2006.  See [[Religion in the United States]] for a complete tabulation.</ref>

Religion among some Americans is highly dynamic: over the period 1990–2001, those groups whose portion of the population at least doubled were, in descending order of growth, [[Wicca]]ns, [[non-denominational Christianity|nondenominational Christians]], [[Deism|Deists]], [[Sikhism|Sikhs]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]], [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]], [[New Age]] adherents, [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Full Gospel]] adherents, [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], independent Christians, those who refused to answer the question, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel|Foursquare Gospel]] adherents.<ref name=POP>[http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/population/pop.pdf Self-Described Religious Identification of Adult Population: 1990 and 2001]. U.S. Census Bureau's ''Statistical Abstract of the United States'', 2006.</ref>

Religion has traditionally played a large role in American society; many of the original European colonists came to America for religious reasons. Religion still has a major influence on [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] and culture, arguably more so than in other industrialized nations.

===Education===
{{main|Education in the United States|Educational attainment in the United States}}
[[Image:RotundaII.jpg|225px|right|thumb|The [[University of Virginia]], designed and founded by [[Thomas Jefferson]], is one of 19 [[World Heritage Site]]s in the United States and one of many highly regarded universities supported by the [[U.S. state|state]] level of government.]]
[[Education in the United States]] is a combination of public and private entities. Public education is the responsibility of state and local governments, rather than the federal government. The [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] of the federal government, however, exerts some influence through its ability to control funding. Students are generally obliged to attend school starting with [[kindergarten]], and ending with the [[Twelfth grade|12th grade]], which is normally completed at age 18, but many states may allow students to drop out as early as age 16. Besides [[public school]]s, parents may also choose to educate their own children at [[homeschooling|home]] or to send their children to [[parochial school|parochial]] or [[private school]]s. After [[high school]], students may choose to attend universities, either [[public university|public]] or [[private university|private]]. 

[[Image:Stanford University Hoover Tower.JPG|155px|thumb|left|There are also renowned private universities in the U.S., such as [[Stanford University]].]]

Public universities receive the bulk of their funding from the [[U.S. state|state]] governments, in contrast to most other countries where they are the responsibility of the federal government. Alumni donations and other sources also contribute large amounts of funding to both public and private universities, and most of the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|top university endowments]] in the world are owned by universities in the United States.  Many students take out low-interest [[student loan]]s that they are required to pay back after graduation (the interest paid on such loans is [[tax deduction|tax deductible]]). Tuition at private universities is generally much higher than at public universities. 

There are many competitive [[List of colleges and universities in the United States|institutions of higher education]] in the United States, both private and public. The United States has 168 universities in the world's top 500, 17 of which are in the top 20.<ref>[http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2005/ARWU2005Statistics.htm ARWU2005 Statistics] by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Shanghai Jiao Tong university]]. URL accessed on 05 October 2006</ref> There are also many smaller universities and [[liberal arts]] colleges, and local [[community college]]s of varying quality across the country with open admission policies.

The United Nations assigned an Education Index of 99.9 to the United States, ranking it number 1 in the world, a position it shares with about 20 other nations.<ref name=undp>{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2005/pdf/HDR05_HDI.pdf |title=Human development indicators |accessdate=2006-11-07 |format=PDF |work=United Nations Development Programme, Human Development Reports}}</ref> The United States has a basic [[literacy rate]] at 98%<ref name=EDU>[http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/PDF/2006470.PDF A First Look at the Literacy of America’s Adults in the 21st Century], U.S. Department of Education, 2003.

===Health===
{{main|Health care in the United States}}
The overall performance of the United States [[health care system]] was ranked 15th by the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/annex09_en.pdf "Overall Health system attainment in all Member States] 1997.

''BBC''. Retrieved on 5 October 2006.</ref>

Unlike in many Western countries, the healthcare system is not fully-[[publicly funded health care|publicly funded]] but is a mix of public and private funding. In 2004, private insurance paid for 36% personal health expenditures, private out-of-pocket payments were 15%, while federal, state, and local governments paid 44%.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus06.pdf Health, United States, 2006]. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.</ref>  In 2005, there were 41.2 million people in the U.S. (14.2 percent of the population) who were without healthcare insurance for at least part of that year.(ibid) Therefore, the those statistics do not necessarily reflect people who don't have health insurance, but rather did not have it at one point during the year. For example, many of these may have been in between jobs for part of the year. Moreover, not having health insurance is not equivalent to not being able to afford it; some of these may be young and healthy with low risk of serious illness and therefore choosing to not to purchase it. In fact, approximately one-third of these 41.2 million who did not have health insurance for at least part of the year live in households with an income over $50,000, with half of these having an income of over $75,000.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/hlthin05.html Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2005.] U.S. Census Bureau.</ref> Also, another third of those of the 41.2 million are people who are eligible for public health insurance programs but have not signed up for them.<ref>According to Dr. David Gratzer, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Interviewed in the Sun, in the article [http://www.nysun.com/article/46304?page_no=1 Momentum Grows on Health Care].</ref> That leaves approximately 2% of the population truly without access to healthcare insurance. [[Health insurance]] in the United States is traditionally a benefit of some kinds of employment. However, emergency care facilities are required to provide service regardless of the patient's ability to pay. Medical bills are the most common reason for personal [[bankruptcy]] in the United States.<ref>[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.w5.63/DC1 "Illness And Injury As Contributors To Bankruptcy"], by David U.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of the United States}}
[[Image:Elvis presley.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Elvis Presley]] in 1957]]
[[Image:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|American cultural icons, such as [[apple pie]], [[baseball]], and the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].]]
The culture of the United States began as the culture of its first English colonists. The culture quickly evolved as an independent frontier culture supplemented by indigenous and Spanish–Mexican [[cowboy]] culture and by the cultures of subsequent waves of immigrants, first from Europe and Africa and later from Asia. Overall, significant cultural influences came from Europe, especially from the [[German culture|German]], [[Culture of England|English]] and [[Culture of Ireland|Irish]] cultures and later from Italian, Greek and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] cultures. Descendants of enslaved West Africans preserved some cultural traditions from [[West Africa]] in the early United States. Geographical place names largely reflect the combined English, [[Netherlands|Dutch]], French, German, Spanish, and Native American components of U.S. history.<ref name="Dealing with Diversity">{{cite book | last =Adams | first =J.Q. | authorlink = | coauthors =Pearlie Strother-Adams | year =2001 | title =Dealing with Diversity | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company | location =Chicago, IL |id = 0-7872-8145-X}}</ref>

There are two dominant sociological models of cultural assimilation.  The traditional [[melting pot]]  model describes a form of homogenization.  Immigrants from other cultures bring unique cultural aspects which are incorporated into the larger American culture, but then the immigrant populations gradually adopt the unified culture, forming a single "alloy".  A more recently articulated model is that of the [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]], in which immigrant cultures retain some of their unique characteristics. Instead of merging with a unified American culture, they intermingle, forming a [[Mixture|heterogeneous mixture]], not unlike a salad composed of different vegetables.<ref>Joyce Millet, [http://www.culturalsavvy.com/understanding_american_culture.htm Understanding American Culture: From Melting Pot to Salad Bowl]. [http://culturalsavvy.com Cultural Savvy].

An important component of American culture is the [[American Dream]]: the idea that, through hard work, courage, and [[self-determination]], regardless of social class, a person can [[social mobility|gain a better life]].<ref>Boritt, Gabor S. ''Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream''. Page 1. [[1994|December 1994]]. [[University of Illinois Press]]. ISBN 0-252-06445-3.</ref> 

===Cuisine===
{{main|Cuisine of the United States}}
[[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]] uses Native American ingredients such as [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[potatoes]], [[maize|corn]], and [[squash (fruit)|squash]], which have become integral parts of American culture. Such popular icons as [[apple pie]], [[pizza]], and [[hamburger]]s are either derived from or are actual European dishes. [[Burritos]] and [[taco]]s have their origins in Mexico. [[Soul food]], which originated among [[History of slavery|African slaves]], is popular in the U.S. as well. However, many foods now enjoyed worldwide either originated in the United States or were altered by American chefs.

===Visual arts===
{{main|Visual arts of the United States}}
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Warhol-Marilyns.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Andy Warhol]]'s famous screenprinting of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in the [[1960s]]]] -->
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]] took most of its cues from Europe. Painting, sculpture, and literature looked to Europe as a model, and for approval. By the end of the U.S. Civil War, a more native voice had emerged in [[American literature]]. [[Mark Twain]], [[Emily Dickinson]], and [[Walt Whitman]] all spoke in an American vernacular and voice. Visual art was slower to find its own distinct American expression. The 1913 [[Armory show]] in New York City, an exhibition which brought European modernist artists' work to the U.S., both shocked the public and influenced art making in the United States for the remainder of the twentieth century. The exhibition had a twofold effect of communicating to American artists that artmaking was about expression, not only aesthetics or [[realism]], and at the same time showing that Europe had abandoned its conservative model of ranking artists according to a strict academic hierarchy. This encouraged American artists to find a personal voice, and a modernist movement, responding to [[American studies|American civilization]], emerged in the United States. [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946), photographer, [[Charles Demuth]] (1883–1935) and [[Marsden Hartley]] (1877–1943), both painters, helped establish an American viewpoint in the [[fine art]]s. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, founded in 1929, became a showcase for American and International [[contemporary art]]. Following the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], a shift occurred with the decline of Paris as the world's art center and the emergence of New York as the center of contemporary fine art for the U.S. and the world.

===Music ===
{{main|Music of the United States}}
Music also traces to the country's diverse cultural roots through an array of styles. [[rock music|Rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[soul music|soul]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues|blues]], and [[jazz]] are among the country's most internationally renowned [[genre]]s. Since the late 19th century, popular recorded music from the United States has become increasingly known across the world, such that some forms of American [[popular music]] are heard almost everywhere.<ref>Provine, Rob with Okon Hwang and Andy Kershaw. "Our Life Is Precisely a Song" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 2'', pg. 167. ISBN 1-85828-636-0.</ref>

===Cinema===
{{main|Cinema of the United States}}
The birth of [[Cinema of the United States|cinema]], as well as its development, largely took place in the United States. In 1878, the first recorded instance of sequential photographs capturing and reproducing motion was [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s series of a [[:Image:The Horse in Motion.jpg|running horse]], which the British-born photographer produced in [[Palo Alto, California]], using a row of still cameras. Since then, the American film industry, based in [[Hollywood, California]], has had a profound effect on cinema across the world. Other genres that originated in the United States and spread worldwide include the [[American comic book|comic book]] and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[animated film]]s. 

===Sports===
