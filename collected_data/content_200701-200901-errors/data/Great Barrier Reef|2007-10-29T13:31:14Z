A large part of the reef is protected by the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]], which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as overfishing and tourism.  Other environmental pressures to the reef and its [[ecosystem]] include water quality from [[runoff]], climate change accompanied by mass [[coral bleaching]], and cyclic outbreaks of the [[crown-of-thorns starfish]].

==Geology and geography==

<!-- The oldest dated coral on the reef now is a species of [[Porites]] known as [[boulder coral]], which is only about 1,000 years old (it grows about 1 centimetre or 3/8 inch per year). Note--this used to be in the Reef Facts for Tour Guides reference until they updated it in 2006. It should not appear in this wiki article until it can be confirmed from a scientific publication.-->

The Reef Research Centre, a [[Cooperative Research Centre]], has found coral 'skeleton' [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] that date back half a million years.<ref name = "CRCage">{{cite web|author=CRC Reef Research Centre Ltd|title=What is the Great Barrier Reef?|url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/discover/coralreefs/coralgbr.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority says that corals have been growing in the region for as long as 25 million years, but have not always formed coral reef structures.

Dating inconsistencies stem from how reefs fluctuate (grow and recede) as the [[sea level]] changes. They can increase in diameter from 1 to 2 centimetres per year, and grow vertically anywhere from 1 to 15 centimetres (0.4&ndash;12&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]) per year; however, they are limited to growing above a depth of {{m to ft|150|spell=UK|precision=0|wiki=yes}} due to their need for sunlight, and cannot grow above sea level.<ref>{{cite web|author=MSN Encarta|year=2006 |title=Great Barrier Reef| url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575831/Great_Barrier_Reef.html|accessdate=2006-12-11}}</ref>

According to the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]], the current, living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on an older platform about 20,000 years ago.<ref name = "GBRMPAage"/> The [[Australian Institute of Marine Science]] agrees, which places the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. At around that time, the sea level was {{m to ft|120|spell=UK|precision=0|}} lower than it is today. The land that formed the [[wiktionary:substrate|substrate]] of the Great Barrier Reef was a [[coastal plain]] with some larger hills (some of which were themselves remnants of older reefs).<ref name ="AIMSage">{{cite web | last = Tobin | first = Barry | title = How the Great Barrier Reef was formed | publisher = Australian Institute of Marine Science | date = 1998, revised 2003 | url = http://www.aims.gov.au/pages/research/project-net/reefs/apnet-reefs00.html | accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref>

[[Image:Heron Island, Australia - View of Island from helicopter.JPG|right|thumb|[[Heron Island]], a coral cay in the southern Great Barrier Reef.]]
From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, the [[Sea level rise|sea level rose]] steadily. As it rose, the corals could then grow higher on the hills of the coastal plain. By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was {{m to ft|60|spell=UK|precision=0|}} lower than the present day, and corals began to grow around the hills of the coastal plain, which were, by then, [[Island#Continental islands|continental islands]]. As the sea level rose further still, most of the continental islands were submerged. The corals could then overgrow the hills, to form the present [[cay]]s and reefs. Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years.<ref name="AIMSage"/>The CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present, living reef structure at 6,000 to 8,000 years old.<ref name="CRCage"/>

[[Image:Sea Temperature and Bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef.jpg|thumb|left|Sea Temperature and Bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef]]
Another key threat faced by the Great Barrier Reef is pollution and declining water quality. The rivers of north eastern Australia provide significant pollution of the Reef during tropical flood events with over 90% of this pollution being sourced from farms.<ref>{{cite web|date=2003|url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p01258bs.pdf|title=Coastal water quality |work=The State of the Environment Report Queensland 2003 |publisher=Environment Protection Agency Queensland|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> Farm run-off is polluted as a result of overgrazing and excessive [[fertiliser]] and pesticide use.

The unsustainable [[overfishing]] of [[keystone species]], such as the [[Triton (mollusk)|Giant Triton]], can cause disruption to [[food chain]]s vital to life on the reef.

Other threats to the Great Barrier Reef include shipping accidents, oil spills, and tropical cyclones.

==Human use==

===Management===
{{main|Great Barrier Reef Marine Park}}
After the Royal Commissions' findings, in 1975 the [[Government of Australia]] created the Great Barrier Reef [[Marine Park]] and defined what activities were prohibited on the Great Barrier Reef.<ref>{{cite web| author=Commonwealth of Australia| year=1975| title=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/gbrmpa1975257/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> The park is managed, in partnership with the [[Government of Queensland]], through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure that it is widely understood and used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning, management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as [[eco-tourism]] certification) are used in the effort to conserve the Great Barrier Reef.

In July 2004, a new zoning plan was brought into effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for the conservation of [[marine ecosystem]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Zoning Plan 2003|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/10591/Zoning_Plan.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-02}} (PDF)</ref> The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using the [[marxan|MARXAN]] software. <ref>Fernandes et al. (2005) ''Establishing representative no-take areas in the Great Barrier Reef: large-scale implementation of theory on marine protected areas'', Conservation Biology, 19(6), 1733-1744.</ref> While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%.<ref>{{cite web|author=World Wildlife Fund Australia|year=|title=Great Barrier Reef - WWF-Australia|url=http://www.wwf.org.au/ourwork/oceans/gbr/|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> At the time, it was the largest [[Marine Protected Area|marine protected area]] in the world, although as of 2006, the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument]] is the largest.<ref name=BBC_5083974>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5083974.stm Bush to protect Hawaiian islands], [[BBC News]], [[15 June]] [[2006]]</ref>

In 2006, a review was undertaken of the ''Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975''. Some recommendations of the review are that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] Outlook Report should be published, examining the health of the Great Barrier Reef, the management of the reef, and environmental pressures.<ref name="1975review"/><ref>{{cite web

===Tourism===
Due to its vast [[biodiversity]], warm clear waters and its accessibility from the floating guest facilities called '[[live aboard]]s', the reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially [[scuba diving|scuba divers]]. Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips to the reef. Several continental and coral cay islands have been turned into [[resort]]s, including the pristine resort island of [[Lady Elliot Island]].

As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism in the Great Barrier Reef generates over [[Australian dollar|AU$]]4 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Summary report of the social and economic impacts of the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.|url=http://www.reefed.edu.au/rap/pdf/JUG_SR_09-12-03.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-19}} (PDF)</ref> (A 2005 estimate puts the figure at [[AU$]]5.1 billion.<ref name = 2005Brochure>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Protecting Biodiversity Brochure 2005|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/brochures/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>) Approximately two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year= |title=Number of Tourists Visiting The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park| url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/tourism/gbr_visitation/numbers|accessdate=2006-10-12}} </ref> Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine [[Tourism|tourism industry]], there are some very popular areas near shore (such as [[Green Island National Park|Green Island]]) that have suffered damage due to overfishing and land based run off.

A variety of boat tours and cruises are offered, from single day trips, to longer voyages. Boat sizes range from [[dinghies]] to [[superyacht]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Onboard The Tourism Operator's Handbook for the Great Barrier Reef - What You Do|url=http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/yourproduct/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> [[Glass bottom boat|Glass-bottomed boats]] and [[underwater observatory|underwater observatories]] are also popular, as are [[helicopter]] flights. By far, the most popular tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef are [[snorkelling]] and diving, for which pontoons are often used, and the area is often enclosed by nets. The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality.

Management of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism [[ecological sustainability|ecologically sustainable]]. A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/> This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA's income.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Onboard The Tourism Operator's Handbook for the Great Barrier Reef - How is the Money Used?|url=http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/emc/use_of/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref> Plans of management are also in place for the popular tourist destinations of Cairns and the [[Whitsunday Islands]], which account for 85% of the tourism in the region.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/>
Policies on [[cruise ship]]s, [[bareboat charter]]s, and anchorages limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/>

===Fishing===
The [[fishing industry]] in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=Access Economics Pty Ltd|year=2005|title=Measuring the economic and financial value of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/about_us/documents/economic_values_report.pdf|accessdate=2007-03-16}} (PDF)</ref> It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one's family.<ref name= traditionalfishing/> [[Wonky hole]]s in the reef provide particularly productive fishing areas.
