'''Nathu La''' {{audio|Nathula.ogg|listen}} ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]: नाथू ला, [[IAST]]: ''Nāth Lā''; {{bo|t=རྣ་ཐོས་ལ་}}) is a [[mountain pass]] in the [[Himalaya]]. It is located on the [[India|Indo]]&ndash;[[People's Republic of China|China]] border connecting the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Sikkim]] with the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[People's Republic of China]]. The pass, at 4,310&nbsp;[[metres|m]] (14,140&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[mean sea level]], forms part of an offshoot of the ancient [[Silk Road]].

</ref> It can also spelled ''Ntula'', ''Natu La'', ''Nathula'', or ''Natula''.

Nathu La is one of the three trading border posts shared between China and India. Sealed by India after the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], it was re-opened in 2006 following numerous bilateral trade agreements. The opening of the pass bolstered the economy of the region and is expected to play key role in the growing Sino-Indian trade. Currently, agreements between the two nations limit the export of 29 goods from Indian and 15 goods from Chinese sides respectively. The opening of the pass also shortens the travel distance to important [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] pilgrimage sites in the region.

==History==
Nathu La is located on the 563&nbsp;km long Old Silk Route (an offshoot of the historic [[Silk Road]]), connecting [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] to the plains of [[Bengal]] to the south. In 1815, trade picked up in volume after the [[British Empire|British]] annexed territories belonging to the [[Sikkim|Sikkimese]], [[Nepal|Nepalese]] and [[Bhutan|Bhutanese]]. The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873, after the [[Darjeeling]] [[Deputy Commissioner]] published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet. In December 1893, the [[Chogyal|Sikkimese monarchy]] and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement allowing trade to flourish between the two nations.<ref name="toi-1"/> The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened.<ref name="timeline">{{cite news

Nathu La had played a key role in the [[British expedition to Tibet]]. In June 1903, Colonel [[Francis Younghusband]], serving as British commissioner to Tibet, led a diplomatic mission having five officers and 500 troops through Nathu La to [[Khamber Jong]], a tiny Tibetan village north of Sikkim. The objective of the mission was to meet Chinese and Tibetan representatives and discuss mutual non-aggression and trade agreements. But no Chinese or Tibetan delegates arrived till November, and the diplomatic mission was recalled. [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]] [[Lord Curzon]] decided to dispatch a much larger army to the Tibetan capital Lhasa to dictate a treaty to the state's rulers. On [[11 December]] [[1903]], keeping in view the climatic hostilities, an army of nearly 5,000 [[Gurkha]] and [[Pathan]] troops was dispatched. Tibetan government sent two negotiators to stop the British troops, but they failed to halt the troop's march. The invasion halted with entry of British troops in Lhasa.<ref name="Tibet expedition">{{cite web| url= http://specials.rediff.com/news/2006/jul/06sld02.htm| title=Nathu La: The early years | date=[[2006-07-06]] | accessdate=2006-12-01 | publisher=Rediff.com}}</ref> In September 1904, the British troops departed Lhasa, and a convention signed by the British and Tibetans facilitated the setting up of trading posts at [[Gyantse]] and [[Gartok]] (in Tibet) and ceded control of the [[Chumbi Valley]] to the British. However the treaty took place in the absence of the 13th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Thubten Gyatso]] who had fled to [[Urga]] in [[Mongolia]] after the military expedition. Later in November that year, [[China]] and [[Great Britain]] inked an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet.<ref name="Thieves">Carrington, Michael: "Officers Gentlemen and Thieves: The Looting of Monasteries during the 1903/4 Younghusband Mission to Tibet", Modern Asian Studies 37, 1 (2003), pp 81-109.</ref><ref name="toi-2"> {{cite news

On [[1 September]] [[1958]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Indira Gandhi]] (his daughter), and [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]] (son and adviser for internal affairs for [[Tashi Namgyal]], the [[Chogyal]] of Sikkim) used this pass for going to Bhutan. After the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) took control of Tibet in 1950 and suppressed a Tibetan uprising in 1959, the passes into Sikkim became a conduit for refugees from Tibet. During the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], the pass witnessed skirmishes between soldiers of the two countries. Though Sikkim was at that time an independent monarchy, it had allowed Indian troops to man its borders.

During the 1990s, bilateral trade agreements were signed by India and China that paved way for opening of the pass. In December 1991, India and China signed the Memorandum on the Resumption of Border Trade. Again in July 1992, the Protocol on Entry and Exit Procedures for Border Trade was signed, and together these two documents contained provisions for border trade through Nathu La.

In 2003, with the thawing of [[Sino-Indian relations]], Indian Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]'s visit to China led to the resumption of talks on opening the border. Later in 2004, the Indian Defence Minister's visit to China led to the formal opening of the pass. In the years before the re-opening, the only person permitted to cross the barbed-wire frontier, with an Indian military escort, was a Chinese postman who would hand over the mail to his Indian counterpart in a building at the border.

==Flora and fauna==
[[Image:Nathu La Fauna 2.jpg|thumb|Flora around Nathu La]]
On going to Nathu La from Gangtok, the vegetation gradually changes from [[sub-tropical]] forests to temperate to wet and dry [[alpine climate|alpine]] to cold [[tundra]] desert devoid of vegetation. The region has very little vegetation, and consists of mostly scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include Dwarf [[Rhododendron]]s, i.e. ''Rhododendron anthopogon'', ''R. setosum'', and [[Juniperus]]. The meadows include the genera ''[[Poa]]'', ''[[Meconopsis]]'', ''[[Pedicularis]]'', ''[[Primula]]'', and ''[[Aconitum]]''. The region has a four-month growing season during which [[grass]]es, [[sedges]] and [[medicinal herb]]s grow abundantly, that support a host of insect fauna as well as the wild and domestic herbivores, [[lark]]s and [[finch]]es. There are no permanent human settlements in the region. Small number of nomadic Tibetan graziers or ‘Dokpas’ (who herd [[yak]], [[sheep]] and [[pashmina]]-type [[goat]]s) can be found in the region. The region has large number of defense personnel because of its proximity to the border with China. There has been intense grazing pressure by both the domestic and wild herbivores on the land after the border was closed due to the 1962 war. [[Feral dog]]s are considered a major hazard in this region. The region around Nathu La contains mostly endangered species including Tibetan [[Gazelle]], [[Snow Leopard]], [[Tibetan Wolf]], [[Tibetan Snowcock]], [[Lammergeier]], [[Raven]], [[Golden Eagle]] and [[Ruddy Shelduck]]. The presence of [[landmine]]s in the area causes casualties among yak, [[Nayan]], [[Kiang]] and Tibetan wolf.<ref name="Vegetation"/>

[[Image:Nathu La Fauna 1.jpg|thumb|Vegetation of the region]]
The avifauna consists of various types of [[Laughingthrush|laughing thrushes]] in shrubs and on the forest floor. The blue whistling [[thrush]], [[redstart]]s and [[forktail]]s are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include [[warbler]]s, [[Old World babbler|tit-babbler]]s, [[treecreeper]]s, [[white-eye]]s, [[wren]]s, and [[Rosefinch|rose finches]]. [[Bird of prey|Raptors]] such as [[black eagle]], [[Black-winged kite]] and [[kestrel]]s; and [[pheasant]]s such as [[monals]] and [[blood pheasant]] are also found.<ref name="Vegetation"/>

Up to 1962, when the pass was sealed, goods such as pens, watches, cereals, cotton cloth, edible oils, soaps, building materials, and dismantled scooters and four-wheelers were exported to Tibet on [[mule]]-back. Two hundred mules, each carrying about 80&nbsp;kg (175&nbsp;lb) of load used to ferry goods from Gangtok to Lhasa which used to take 20–25 days.

On the Tibetan side, before the pass was opened, most of the foreign trade of Tibet went through the port of [[Tianjin]] more than 4,000&nbsp;km (2,500&nbsp;mi) away. By Nathu La Pass, this distance has been shortened to 1,200&nbsp;km (745&nbsp;mi).<ref name="Port distance">{{cite news | title = What border markets can bring? | publisher = China Tibet Information Center | date = [[2006-07-05]] | url = http://en.tibet.cn/newfeature/cknduila/ckndl_qt/t20060705_130888.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-03}}</ref> Two highways, from [[Kangmar]] to [[Yadong]] and Yadong to Nathu La, have been listed in the 2006 construction plans of the Ministry of Transportation and the Development and Reform Commission of China.

A major concern of the Indian government is the trafficking of wildlife products such as [[tiger]] and [[leopard]] skin, bones, [[bear]] [[gall bladder]]s, [[otter]] pelts, and [[shahtoosh]] wool into India. The Indian government has undertaken a program to sensitise the police and other law enforcement agencies in the area. Most of such illicit trade currently takes place via Nepal.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/23/stories/2006062322050300.htm | title=Doubts over traffickers using re-opened Nathula Pass | work=[[The Hindu]] | accessdate=2006-07-06 |date=[[2006-06-23]] | first=Bindu Shajan | last=Perappadan}}</ref>
