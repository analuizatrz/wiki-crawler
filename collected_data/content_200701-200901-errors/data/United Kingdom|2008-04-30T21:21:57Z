== History ==
{{Main|History of the United Kingdom|History of the formation of the United Kingdom}}

[[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] had existed as separate sovereign and independent states with their own [[monarchs]] and political structures since the 9th century. The once independent [[Principality of Wales]] fell under the control of English monarchs from the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284, but was only formally annexed or "united" with England under the two [[Laws in Wales Act]]s of [[1535]] and [[1542]]. Though the Scottish King, [[James I of England|James VI]], became King of England as well in 1603, thereby creating a [[personal union]] between the kingdoms, England (including Wales) and Scotland remained separate countries until the [[Treaty of Union]] was agreed a century later and put into effect by the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. The Acts of Union, passed by the Parliaments of England and Scotland respectively, created a political union in the form of a united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/act.html |title=The Treaty (or Act) of Union, 1707 |publisher= |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref>
The [[Act of Union 1800]] united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been gradually brought under English control between 1541 and [[Treaty of Limerick|1691]], to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#act | title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref>

[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|left|The [[British Empire]] in 1897. By 1920 it had become the [[list of largest empires|largest empire in history]]]]
Over the next century the United Kingdom played an important role in developing [[Western world|Western]] ideas of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] as well as making significant contributions to [[literature]], the [[arts]] and [[science]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |authorlink=Niall Ferguson |year=2003 |title=Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order |publisher=Basic Books |id=ISBN 0-465-02328-2}}</ref> The UK-led [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed the country and fuelled the [[British Empire]]. During this time, like other [[Great Powers]], the UK was involved in colonial exploitation, including the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]], though the passing of the 1807 [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] made the UK the first country to prohibit trade in slaves.

After the defeat of [[Napoleon]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Britain became the principal naval power of the 19th century. At its peak the [[British Empire]] controlled large amounts of territory in Asia, Africa, Oceania and America.

At the end of the [[Victorian era]] the United Kingdom lost its industrial leadership, particularly to the [[German Empire]], which surpassed the UK in industrial production and trade in the 1890s, and to the [[United States]]. Britain remained an eminent power and its empire expanded to its maximum size by 1921, gaining the [[League of Nations]] mandate over former German and Ottoman colonies after [[World War I]].

Long simmering tensions in Ireland led to the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|partition]] of the island in 1920, followed by independence for the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. Six of the nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] of the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]] remained within the UK, which then [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|changed]] to the current name in 1927 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.<ref name="CAIN">{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm |title=The Anglo-Irish Treaty, [[6 December]] [[1921]] |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref>

[[Image:Supermarinespitfire.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Britain]]. The United Kingdom was the only [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Europe]]an country to remain free from occupation during [[World War II]].]]
After [[World War I]], the world's first large-scale international broadcasting network, the [[BBC]], was created. In 1924 the country's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour movement]], which had been gaining strength since the late 1890s, formed the [[First Labour Government (UK)|first Labour government]]. Britain fought [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]], with its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] allies including [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and [[India]], later to be joined by further [[Allies of World War II|allies]] such as the United States. Wartime leader [[Winston Churchill]] and his peacetime successor [[Clement Atlee]] helped plan the post-war world as part of the "Big Three". World War II left the United Kingdom financially damaged. [[Loans]] taken out during and after World War II from both Canada and the United States were economically costly but, along with post-war [[Marshall Plan|Marshall aid]], the UK began the road to recovery.

The immediate post-war years saw the establishment of the British [[Welfare State]] and one of the world's first and most comprehensive public [[National Health Service|health services]], while the demands of a recovering economy brought people from all over the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] to create a [[multi-ethnic|multiethnic]] Britain. Although the new post-war limits of Britain's [[political]] role were confirmed by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the international spread of the [[English language|language]] meant the continuing impact of its literature and [[culture]], while at the same time from the 1960s its [[popular culture]] found influence abroad. Following a period of global economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the 1980s saw the inflow of substantial [[North Sea Oil|oil revenues]] and economic growth. The premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] marked a significant change of direction from the post-war political and economic consensus; a path that was not reversed by the [[New Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]] in 1997.

The United Kingdom was one of the 12 founding members of the [[European Union]] at its launch in 1992 with the signing of the [[Treaty on European Union]].  Prior to that, it had been a member of the EU's forerunner, the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), from 1973. The attitude of the present [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government towards further integration with this organisation is mixed,<ref name=Times>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-1948441,00.html |title=Modest progress but always on back foot |publisher=Times Online |date=[[2005-12-21]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] favouring a return of some powers and competencies to the state,<ref name=Conservatives>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=europe.news.campaigns.display.page&obj_id=73417 |title=European Constitution: bad for Britain, bad for Europe |publisher=Conservative Party |accessdate=2006-05-23}}</ref> and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] supportive of current engagement.

The end of the 20th century witnessed a major change to the government of the United Kingdom with [[devolution]] to [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] taking effect in 1999. The creation of the devolved [[Scottish parliament]] in particular, with powers to legislate over a wide range of issues, is beginning to add to differences between the [[constituent countries]] of the United Kingdom. It has brought to the fore the so-called [[West Lothian question]] which is a complaint that devolution for Scotland and Wales but not England has created a situation where MPs in the UK parliament can vote on matters affecting England alone but on those same matters Scotland and Wales can make their own decisions.  In 2007, the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) won the [[Scottish Parliament Election, 2007|Scottish parliament elections]] and formed a [[minority government]]. New [[First Minister]], [[Alex Salmond]], hopes to hold a referendum on [[Scottish Independence]] before 2011, though the SNP may be unable to get a Bill to hold such a referendum approved by the Scottish parliament due to the minority position of the SNP government. If a referendum is held, an opinion poll in April 2008 suggested the result could be close as support for independence had reached 41% with just 40% supporting retention of the Union.<ref>[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2192965.0.0.php 41% of Scots back the break-up of the union] Sunday Herald, April 13th, 2008</ref> The response of the unionist parties has been to call for the establishment of a Commission to examine further devolution of powers,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7129899.stm MSPs back devolution review body] BBC News, 6th December 2007</ref>a position that has the support of the Prime Minister.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7249002.stm PM backs Scottish powers review] BBC News, 17th February 2008</ref>

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of the United Kingdom|Monarchy of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM Queen Elizabeth II]]]]

The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], as head of state; the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch of the UK]] serves as head of state of [[Commonwealth realm|fifteen other Commonwealth countries]], putting the UK in a [[personal union]] with those other states. The [[British crown|Crown]] has sovereignty over the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]]. Collectively, these three territories are known as the [[Crown dependencies]], lands owned by the [[British monarch]] but not part of the United Kingdom. They are not part of the [[European Union]]. However, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has the authority to legislate for the dependencies, and the British government manages their foreign affairs and defence.

The UK has fourteen [[British overseas territory|overseas territories]] around the world, the last remaining territories of the [[British Empire]]. The overseas territories are not considered part of the UK, but in most cases, the local populations have British citizenship and the right of abode in the UK. This has been the case since 2002.

The UK has a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary government]] based on strong democratic traditions: the [[Westminster system]] has been emulated around the world — a legacy of the [[British Empire]].

[[Constitution of the United Kingdom|The UK's constitution]] governs the legal framework of the country and consists mostly of written sources, including [[statute]]s, judge made [[case law]], and international treaties. As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and [[law]] considered to be "constitutional law," the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] can perform "constitutional reform" simply by passing [[Acts of Parliament]] and thus has the [[political power|power]] to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/sovereignty.cfm|title=Official UK Parliament web page on parliamentary sovereignty}}</ref> The United Kingdom is one of the three countries in the world today that does not have a codified [[constitution]] (the other two being [[New Zealand]] and [[Israel]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm#UK%20Legal%20System |title=A Guide To the UK Legal System |author=Sarah Carter |publisher=[[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

The position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the UK's [[head of government]], belongs to the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|current leader]] of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The Prime Minister and their Cabinet are formally appointed by the Monarch to form [[Her Majesty's Government]]. However, the Prime Minister chooses the Cabinet, and by convention, HM The Queen respects the Prime Minister's choices. The [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons, to which [[Responsible government|they are responsible]]. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all of whom are sworn into [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]], and become [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]]. ''The Rt Hon'' [[Gordon Brown]] [[MP]], leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], has been Prime Minister, [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]] since [[27 June]] [[2007]].

[[Image:Westminster palace.jpg|thumb|The [[Houses of Parliament]]]]
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that meets in the [[Palace of Westminster]], is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom. A devolved parliament in [[Scottish parliament|Scotland]] and devolved assemblies in [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], and [[National Assembly for Wales|Wales]] were established following public approval as expressed in [[Referendum|referenda]], but these are not sovereign bodies and could be abolished by the UK parliament. The UK parliament is made up of two houses: an elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and an appointed [[House of Lords]], and any Bill passed requires the [[Royal assent|assent]] of HM The Queen to become law. For elections to the House of Commons, the UK is divided into [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in the United Kingdom|646 constituencies]], with 529 in England, 18 in Northern Ireland, [[Scottish Westminster constituencies from 2005|59 in Scotland]] and 40 in Wales. Each constituency elects one Member of Parliament by [[plurality electoral system|simple plurality]]. General Elections are called by the Monarch when the Prime Minister so advises. Though there is no minimum term for a Parliament, a new election must be called within five years of the previous general election.

Questions over sovereignty have been brought forward due to the UK's membership of the [[European Union]].<ref name=Times20050914>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1779849,00.htm |title=Europe Wins The Power To Jail British Citizens |publisher=The Times |date=[[2005-09-14]]}}</ref> 

The UK's three [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom#Major political parties in the United Kingdom|major political parties]] are the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and the [[Liberal Democrats]], winning between them 616 out of the 646 seats available in the House of Commons at the [[2005 General Election]]. Most of the remaining seats were won by parties that only contest elections in one part of the UK such as the [[Scottish National Party]] (Scotland only), [[Plaid Cymru]] (Wales only), and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], [[Ulster Unionist Party]], and [[Sinn Féin]] (Northern Ireland only, though Sinn Féin also contests elections in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]). In accordance with party policy, no elected Sinn Féin Member of Parliament has ever attended the House of Commons to speak in the House on behalf of their constituents as Members of Parliament are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Monarch. However, the current five [[Sinn Féin]] MPs have since 2002 made use of the offices and other facilities available at Westminster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1771635.stm|title=news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1771635.stm<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

=== Devolved national administrations ===
{{main|Northern Ireland Assembly|Scottish Parliament|National Assembly of Wales}}
[[Image:Edinburgh Scottish Parliament01 2006-04-29.jpg|thumb|[[Scottish Parliament]] is the national legislature of Scotland]]
[[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] each has a [[Devolution|devolved]], [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature and its own [[Executive (government)|government or Executive]], led by a [[First Minister]]. England, despite being the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no devolved executive or legislature and is ruled and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament. This situation has given rise to the so-called [[West Lothian question]] which concerns the fact that MPs from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales help decide the laws that apply to England alone.

The [[Scottish Parliament]] has wide ranging legislative powers over any matter that has not been specifically '[[reserved matters|reserved]]' to the UK parliament, including [[education in Scotland|education]], [[NHS Scotland|healthcare]], [[Scots law]] and [[local government in Scotland|local government]]. Following the [[Scottish Parliament election 2007|2007 elections]], [[Alex Salmond]], leader of the [[Scottish National Party]], became [[First Minister of Scotland]] as head of a minority [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|SNP government]]. The pro-union parties have responded to the electoral success of the SNP by creating a commission to examine the case for devolving additional powers while excluding [[Scottish independence]] as an option.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7311840.stm Devolution review body launched] BBC News, March 25, 2008</ref>

The [[National Assembly for Wales]] has more limited devolved powers than those devolved to Scotland<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/wales_99/the_welsh_assembly/309033.stm Structure and powers of the Assembly] BBC News April 8th, 1999</ref> though it may move towards additional powers in the near future.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/jul/16/wales.devolution What powers does the Welsh Assembly have?] Guardian July 16th, 2007</ref> The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has powers closer to those already devolved to Scotland.

=== Local government ===
{{main|Local government in England|Local government in Northern Ireland|Local government in Scotland|Local government in Wales}}
[[Image:ManchesterTownHall OwlofDoom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manchester Town Hall]] houses the [[Manchester City Council]].]]
Each country of the United Kingdom is subdivided for the purposes of local government. In addition, for more ceremonial purposes, HM The Queen appoints a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] as her personal representative in lieutenancy areas across the UK. [[City status in the United Kingdom|City status]], which is governed by [[Royal Charter]], can also be conferred separate from local government arrangements. Though there are sixty-six cities in the UK - fifty in England; six in Scotland; five in Wales; and five in Northern Ireland - a number of these do not form separate local government units.

The upper-tier [[subdivisions of England]], are the nine intermediate-level [[Regions of England|Government Office Regions]]. Each region is made up of [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|counties]] and [[unitary authority area]]s, apart from [[London]], which consists of 32 [[London borough]]s. London voted in favour of having a directly elected assembly in 1998 and it was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]], but a rejection by a [[Northern England devolution referendums, 2004|referendum in 2004]] of a proposed assembly in the [[North East England|North East]] region stopped this idea in its tracks.<ref>"The Government is now expected to tear up its twelve-year-old plan to create eight or nine regional assemblies in England to mirror devolution in Scotland and Wales."{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article503255.ece|title=Prescott's dream in tatters as North East rejects assembly|accessdate=2008-02-15|work=The Times}}</ref> Below the region level and excluding London, England either has [[county council]]s and district councils or [[unitary authorities]].

[[Local government in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] is presently divided into 26 districts for local government purposes though these councils do not carry out the same range of functions as would be the case in the rest of the United Kingdom.  However, on 13 March 2008, the Executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils to replace the present system. <ref>[http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-doe/news-doe-130308-foster-announces-the.htm ''Foster announces the future shape of local government'', NI Executive]</ref>

Scotland is divided into [[subdivisions of Scotland|32 council areas]] with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] are separate council areas as also is [[Highland Council]] which includes a third of Scotland's area but just over 200,000 people.  The power invested in local authorities is administered by elected councillors, of which there are currently 1,222 who are each paid a part-time salary. Elections are conducted by [[Single Transferable Vote]] in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] or [[Convenor]] to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area.

[[Local government in Wales]] consists of 22 unitary authorities, including the cities of [[Cardiff]], [[Swansea]] and [[Newport]] which are separate unitary authorities in their own right.

The United Kingdom is a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]], a member of the [[G8]] and [[NATO]], and a member state of the [[European Union]]. The UK has a "[[Special Relationship]]" with the [[United States]]. Apart from the US and [[Europe]], Britain's close allies include [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and other [[Anglosphere|English speaking countries]]. Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations and its armed forces, which maintain approximately eighty military installations and other deployments around the globe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpowereurope.eu/|title=www.globalpowereurope.eu/<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

The [[British Army|Army]], [[Naval Service|Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force|Air Force]] are collectively known as the British Armed Forces (or Her Majesty's Armed Forces) and officially the Armed Forces of the Crown. The [[commander-in-chief]] is the monarch, HM [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and they are managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. The armed forces are controlled by the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]], chaired by the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]].

The United Kingdom fields one of the most technologically advanced and best trained armed forces in the world. According to various sources, including the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], the UK has the second highest [[List of countries and federations by military expenditures|military expenditure]] in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/Organisation/KeyFactsAboutDefence/DefenceSpending.htm|title=Defence Spending}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/contents/milap/milex/mex_trends.html|title=www.sipri.org/contents/milap/milex/mex_trends.html<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref> despite only having the 27th largest military in terms of [[List of countries by number of active troops|manpower]].

The United Kingdom is one of the [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|five recognised countries]] possessing nuclear weapons, utilising the [[Vanguard class submarine]]-based [[Trident missile|Trident II]] ballistic missile system.

The British Armed Forces are charged with protecting the United Kingdom and its [[British overseas territories|overseas territories]], promoting the United Kingdom's global security interests, and supporting international peacekeeping efforts.

There are reserve forces supporting the regular military. These include the [[Territorial Army]], the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], [[Royal Marines Reserve]] and the [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]. This puts total active and reserve duty military personnel at approximately 429,500, deployed in over eighty countries.

Despite the United Kingdom's military capabilities, recent pragmatic defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" would be undertaken as part of a coalition.<ref>Office for National Statistics ''UK 2005: The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', p. 89 </ref> Setting aside the [[Operation Palliser|intervention in Sierra Leone]], operations in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Operation Telic|Iraq]] may all be taken as precedent.

== Law ==
{{main|Law of the United Kingdom|English law|Scots law|Northern Ireland law}}

The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system due to it being created by the political union of previously independent countries and the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]] guaranteeing the continued existence of Scotland's separate legal system.  Today the UK has three distinct [[systems of law]]: [[English law]] and [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law]] are based on [[common law|common-law]] principles whereas [[Scots law]] is a hybrid system based on both common-law and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] principles. 

The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") is presently the highest court for both criminal and civil cases in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]], and for civil cases under Scots law. Recent constitutional changes will see the powers of the House of Lords transfer to a new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom]|252&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 258317 bytes -->}}, Department for Constitutional Affairs. Retrieved on [[2006-05-22]]</ref> The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], (comprising the same members as the Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]]), is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the UK overseas territories, and the British crown dependencies.

[[English law]] applies in [[England and Wales]].  The essence of English common law is that it is made by [[judges]] sitting in [[court]]s, applying their common sense and knowledge of [[legal precedent]] (''[[stare decisis]]'') to the facts before them.  The [[Courts of England and Wales|court system]] is headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] (for civil cases) and the [[Crown Court]] (for criminal cases). The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") is presently the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil cases in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]].  A decision of the highest [[appeal court]] in England and Wales, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], is binding on every other court in [[Courts of England and Wales|the hierarchy]], and they will follow its directions.

[[Scots law]] applies in [[Scotland]].  The chief courts are the [[Court of Session]], for civil cases, and the [[High Court of Justiciary]], for criminal cases, while the [[sheriff court]] undertakes almost all the functions of the English County Court but also conducts criminal [[trial]]s with a jury (Sheriff solemn Court) or with a Sheriff and no jury (Sheriff summary Court). The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") presently serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.

The Scots legal system is unique in having three possible [[verdict]]s for a criminal trial: "[[Guilt (law)|guilt]]y", "[[not guilty]]" and "''[[not proven]]''". Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an [[acquittal]] with no possibility of [[retrial]].

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the United Kingdom|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:uk topo en.jpg|thumb|UK's topography]]
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland comprises the island of Great Britain (most of England, Scotland and Wales) and the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland), together with smaller islands. The mainland lies between latitudes 49° and 59° N (the Shetland Islands reach to nearly 61° N), and longitudes 8° W to 2° E. The Royal Greenwich Observatory, near London, is the defining point of the [[Prime Meridian]]. The UK lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, and comes within {{convert|35|km|mi|0}} of the northwest coast of France, from which it is separated by the [[English Channel]]. Northern Ireland shares a {{convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on}} land boundary with [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The Channel Tunnel ("Chunnel") now links the UK with France beneath the English Channel. The greatest distance between two points on the UK mainland of Great Britain is {{convert|1350|km|mi|-1}} between [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]] (near [[Penzance]]) and [[John O'Groats]] in [[Caithness]] (near [[Thurso]]), a two day journey by car. When measured directly north-south it is a little over {{convert|1100|km|mi|-2}} in length and is a fraction under {{convert|500|km|mi|-2}} at its widest. The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately {{convert|245000|sqkm|sqmi|-1}}.

The United Kingdom has a temperate [[climate]], with plentiful rainfall all year round. The temperature varies with the seasons but seldom drops below {{convert|-10|C|lk=on}} or rises above {{convert|35|C}}. The prevailing wind is from the southwest, bearing frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean. Eastern parts are most sheltered from this wind and are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]], bring mild winters, especially in the west, where winters are wet, especially over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north. Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, though it rarely settles to great depth away from high ground.

England accounts for just over half of the total area of the UK, covering {{convert|130410|sqkm|sqmi|-1}}. Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, and mountainous terrain north-west of the [[Tees-Exe line]]. Mountain chains are found in the north-west ([[Cumbrian Mountains]] of the Lake District), north (the upland moors of the [[Pennines]] and [[limestone]] hills of the [[Peak District]]) and south-west ([[Exmoor]] and [[Dartmoor]]).  Lower ranges include the [[limestone]] hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Cotswolds]] and [[Lincolnshire Wolds]], and the [[chalk]] downs of the [[Southern England Chalk Formation]]. The main rivers and estuaries are the [[Thames]], [[Severn]] and the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. England's highest mountain is [[Scafell Pike]], which is in the [[Lake District]] {{convert|978|m|ft|0}}. England has a number of large towns and cities and, in terms of [[Larger Urban Zones in the European Union|Larger Urban Zones]], has six of the top 50 Zones in the European Union.

[[Image:BenNevis2005.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Nevis]], in the [[Grampian Mountains (Scotland)|Grampian Mountains]], is the highest point in the [[British Isles]]]]
Scotland accounts for about a third of the total area of the UK, covering {{convert|78789|sqkm|sqmi|-1}}. The topography of Scotland is distinguished by the [[Highland Boundary Fault]] &ndash; a [[geologic fault|geological rock fracture]] &ndash; which traverses the Scottish mainland from [[Helensburgh]] to [[Stonehaven]]. The faultline separates two distinctively different regions; namely the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to the north and west and the [[Scottish lowlands|lowlands]] to the south and east. The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland's mountainous terrain, including the highest peak, [[Ben Nevis]], at {{convert|1344|m|ft|0}}. Lowland areas, in the southern part of Scotland, are flatter and home to most of the population, especially the narrow waist of land between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and the [[Firth of Forth]] known as the [[Central Lowlands|Central Belt]]. [[Glasgow]] is the largest city in Scotland, although [[Edinburgh]] is the [[Capital city|capital]] and political centre of the country. Scotland also has nearly eight hundred [[List of islands of Scotland|islands]], mainly west and north of the mainland, notably the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]]. 

Wales accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the UK, covering just {{convert|20758|sqkm|sqmi|-1}}. Wales is mostly mountainous though [[South Wales]] is less mountainous than North and Mid Wales. The main population and industrial areas are in [[South Wales]], consisting of the cities of [[Cardiff]], [[Swansea]] and [[Newport]] and surrounding [[South Wales Valleys]].  The highest mountains in Wales are in [[Snowdonia]], and include [[Snowdon]] (''Yr Wyddfa'' in Welsh), which, at 1,085&nbsp;m (3,560&nbsp;ft) is the highest peak in Wales. The 14 (or possibly 15) Welsh mountains over 3,000 feet (914&nbsp;m) high are known collectively as the [[Welsh 3000s]]. Wales borders England to the east and the sea in the other three directions: the [[Bristol Channel]] to the south, [[St George's Channel]] to the west, and the [[Irish Sea]] to the north. Wales has over 1,200&nbsp;km (750&nbsp;miles) of coastline. There are several [[island]]s off the Welsh mainland, the largest being [[Anglesey]] (''Ynys Môn'') in the northwest.

Northern Ireland accounts for just {{convert|14160|sqkm|sqmi|-1}} and is mostly hilly. It includes [[Lough Neagh]], at {{convert|388|sqkm|sqmi|0}}, the largest body of water in the UK and [[Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/geog.htm |title=Geography of Northern Ireland |publisher=University of Ulster |accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref> The highest peak is [[Slieve Donard]] at {{convert|849|m|ft|0}} in the province's [[Mourne Mountains]].

The capitals of the individual countries of the UK are: [[Belfast]] (Northern Ireland), [[Cardiff]] (Wales), [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland) and  [[London]] (England), which is also the capital of the UK as a whole.

According to the 2001 census, the largest towns and cities were;
* above 7 million: [[London]]
* around 1 million: [[Birmingham]]
* above 500,000: [[Glasgow]]
* 400,000 – 500,000: [[Liverpool]], [[Leeds]], [[Sheffield]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Bristol]]

* 250,000 – 300,000: [[Bradford]], [[Cardiff]], [[Belfast]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Wolverhampton]]
* 200,000 – 250,000: [[Nottingham]], [[Plymouth]], [[Southampton]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Derby]]
<!--See main article for the precise figures. They are urban sub-divisions according to the 2001 census, NOT local authority districts.  DO NOT CHANGE THESE UNTIL THE 2011 CENSUS DATA IS AVAILABLE-->

The largest conurbations are as follows:

Though the UK's overall [[population density]] is one of the highest in the world, this masks differences between the countries of the UK: In 2003, England was the most densely populated with 383 people resident per square kilometre, whereas the corresponding figures were 142 people for Wales, 125 for Northern Ireland and 65 for Scotland.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=760 Population] National Statistics </ref> About a quarter of the UK population lives in England's prosperous south-east and is predominantly urban and suburban,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/pyramids/pages/j.asp |title=Census 2001: South East |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> with an estimated 7,517,700 in the capital of London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/subreports/pop_time_series/report.aspx |title=All people population: City of London |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-08-31}}</ref>

Within the UK, England and Wales, at 1.86, were both close to the UK average, but Scotland was lower at only 1.67. The UK's TFR was considerably higher during the 1960s 'baby boom', peaking at 2.95 children per woman in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=369|title=www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=369<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

The present day population of the UK is descended from varied ethnic stocks though mainly: [[Cruithne (people)|pre-Celtic]], [[Celts|Celtic]], Roman, [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], and the [[Normans]]. Since 1945, international ties forged by the [[British Empire]] have contributed to substantial immigration, especially from [[Africa]], [[Caribbean]] and [[South Asia]]. Since EU citizens are free to live and work in other EU member states, the accession of new to the EU of new member states from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] in 2004 has resulted in rising immigration from these countries. As of [[2001 British Census|2001]], 7.9%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=764&Pos=4&ColRank=1&Rank=176 |title=Ethnicity: 7.9% from a non-White ethnic group |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=[[2004-06-24]] |accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>

In 2004, the number of people who became British citizens rose to a record 140,795 - a rise of 12% on the previous year. This number had risen dramatically since 2000. The overwhelming majority of new citizens come from [[Africa]] (32%) and [[Asia]] (40%), the largest three groups being people from [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Somalia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4706862.stm|title=BBC Thousands in UK citizenship queue}}</ref> In 2006, there were 149,035 applications for British citizenship, 32% fewer than in 2005.

When the EU enlarged further east in [[2004]] and again in [[2007]], this gave the right for nationals from countries like [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Lithuania]], and more recently [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] to live in the UK. Figures published in August 2007 indicated that 682,940 people applied to the [[Worker Registration Scheme]] (for nationals of the central and eastern European states that joined the EU in May 2004) between [[1 May]] [[2004]] and [[31 June]] [[2007]], of whom 656,395 were accepted.<ref>Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue & Customs and Communities and Local Government, [http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/6353/aboutus/accessionmonitoringmay04jun1.pdf Accession Monitoring Report: A8 Countries, May 2004-June 2007], [[21 August]] 2007, accessed [[26 August]] 2007.</ref> Self-employed workers and people who are not working (including students) are not required to register under the scheme so this figure represents a lower limit on immigration inflow.

The UK government is currently introducing a new [[Points-based immigration system (United Kingdom)|points-based immigration system]] to replace the existing schemes for immigration from outside of the [[European Economic Area]].

=== Language ===
{{main|Languages of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Anglospeak.svg|thumb|Countries where [[English language|English]] has ''de facto'' or ''de jure'' official language status.]]

Though the UK does not ''[[de jure]]'' have an official language, the predominant [[spoken language]] is [[English language|English]], a [[West Germanic]] language descended from [[Old English]] featuring a large number of borrowings from [[Old Norse]] and [[Norman language|Norman]]. The English language has spread across the world (largely due to the British Empire) and has thus become [[International English|the business language of the world]]. Worldwide, it is [[English language learning and teaching|taught as a second language]] more than any other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=2055 |title=English-Language Dominance, Literature and Welfare |author=Jacques Melitz |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=1999 |accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> 

The other indigenous languages of the UK are [[Scots language|Scots]] (which is closely related to English) and four [[Celtic languages]]. The latter fall into two groups: two P-Celtic languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]]); and two Q-Celtic languages ([[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]). Celtic dialectal influences from [[Cumbric]] persisted in Northern England for centuries, most famously in a unique set of numbers used for counting sheep (see [[Yan Tan Tethera]]). According to the 2001 census, just above 20% of the population of Wales claim to be able to speak Welsh which represents a slight increase on 1991. In addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/multilingual/welsh.shtml Welsh today by Prof. Peter Wynn Thomas]bbc.co.uk</ref>Welsh and Scottish Gaelic are also spoken by small groups around the globe with some [[Scottish Gaelic in Canada|Gaelic]] still spoken in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], and Welsh in [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].

Immigrant languages constitute for up to 10% of the UK's population, [[French language|French]] is spoken by 2.3% of the country's population, 1.0% of Britons speak [[Polish language|Polish]] reflecting the recent mass migration to the UK. 0.9% of the UK's population speak [[German language|German]] and 0.8% [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The majority of other foreign languages spoken in the UK originate from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. A large percentage of the immigrants to the UK come from [[Anglophone]] countries (such as [[Nigeria]], [[Jamaica]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[Philippines]]), which is why there is not a great deal of diversity between some of the country's ethnic minority communities.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in the United Kingdom}}
While the United Kingdom has a long tradition of [[Christianity]] and a link between [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] still remains in England, in practice the UK is a predominantly [[secular]] society with only 38%<ref name=Eurobarometer>{{PDFlink|[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf Eurobarometer poll conducted in 2005]|1.64&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1722129 bytes -->}}. Page 9. European Commission. Retrieved on [[7 December]] [[2006]]</ref> proclaiming a belief in a [[God]]. People identify themselves with [[religion]] in the UK for both cultural and religious reasons and this is reflected by the disparity between the figures for those proclaiming a belief in a [[God]] and those identifying themselves with a particular religion. Christianity has the largest number of adherents followed by Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and Judaism.

==== Christianity ====

[[Image:Westminster abbey west.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Westminster Abbey]] is used for the [[coronation]] of [[British Monarchs]], when they are also made the head of the Church of England.]]

[[Christianity]] is the major religion with many Christian [[churches]], [[denominations]], and [[groups]]. The [[Tearfund]] Survey<ref name=Tearfund_Survey>{{cite web |url=http://www.tearfund.org/webdocs/Website/News/Final%20churchgoing%20report.pdf |title=Tearfund Survey 2007 |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> in 2007 revealed 53% identified themselves as Christian.

The direct influence of the [[Church of England]] has been on the decline for years, but the church retains a [[Lords Spiritual|representation]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] and the right to draft legislative measures (usually related to religious administration), through the [[General Synod]], that can be passed into law, but not amended by Parliament. 

Christianity was first introduced to what is now England and Wales by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]], however it disappeared with their retreat. [[Scotland]] and [[northern England]] were [[Evangelism|evangelised]] first, by [[Celtic missionaries]] from [[Ireland]], such as [[Saint Ninian|Ninian]], [[Columba]] and [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]]. [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] was subsequently sent to southern England by [[Pope Gregory I]] in 597.

The Church of England, which split from [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] in 1534 during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]] (see [[English Reformation]]) is, today, the '[[Established church|established]]' Church in England and the senior branch of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]]. The [[British monarch]] is required to be a member of the Church of England under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and is its [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is the senior bishop of the Church.

The [[Church of Scotland]] (known informally as the [[Kirk]]), which broke with Rome in 1560 (see [[Calvinism]] and [[Scottish Reformation]]) is a [[Presbyterian]] church, recognised as the [[national church]] of Scotland, and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member, and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the Church at the coronation. The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which is now part of the Anglican Communion, dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690, when it split from the Church of Scotland, and is not a 'daughter church' of the Church of England. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the nineteenth century, led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the [[Free Church of Scotland]].

In the 1920s, the [[Church in Wales]] was separated from the Church of England and became '[[Disestablishment|disestablished]]'. The Church in Wales remains in the [[Anglican Communion]]. [[Methodism]] and other independent churches are traditionally strong in Wales.

The Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] was disestablished in the nineteenth century. It covers the entire island of [[Ireland]] (both [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]). In Northern Ireland the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic Church in Ireland]] is the largest single denomination, although [[Protestant]]s are in the majority overall. The [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] is the largest Protestant denomination and is in terms of theology and history closely linked to the Church of Scotland

The [[Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain|Roman Catholic Church]] is the second largest denomination of Christianity in the UK. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], strict laws were passed against Catholics; these were removed by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] laws in 1829. There are separate Catholic hierarchies for [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland|Ireland]].

Other large Christian groups include the [[Methodists]] (founded by [[John Wesley]] in London) and the [[Baptists]]. There are also growing [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, many of which have flourished with [[Immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]] from around the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and beyond. Pentecostal churches are now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article757934.ece 'Fringe' Church winning the believers] Timesonline, December 19, 2006</ref>

[[Indian religions|Religions of Indian origin]], such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] are followed in Britain. As of the 2001 census, there are about 560,000 Hindus and 340,000 Sikhs.

[[Image:London.bankofengland.arp.jpg|thumb|The [[Bank of England]]; the [[central bank]] of the United Kingdom.]]
The UK economy is made up (in descending order of size) of the economies of [[Economy of England|England]], [[Economy of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Economy of Wales|Wales]] and [[Economy of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. The British started the [[Industrial Revolution]], and, like most industrialising countries at the time, initially concentrated on heavy industries such as [[shipbuilding]], [[coal mining]], [[steel]] production, and [[textiles]]. The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the United Kingdom to dominate international trade in the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. The British service sector, however, has grown substantially, and now makes up about 73% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2006-04-26]] |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=9333 |title=Index of Services (experimental) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>
  
The service sector of the United Kingdom is dominated by [[financial services]], especially in banking and insurance. London is the world's largest financial centre with the [[London Stock Exchange]], the [[London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange]], and the [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance market all based in the [[City of London]]. It has the largest concentration of foreign bank branches in the world. In the past decade, a rival financial centre in London has grown in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area, with [[HSBC]] and [[Barclays plc|Barclays Bank]] relocating their head offices there. Many multinational companies that are not primarily UK-based have chosen to site their European or rest-of-world headquarters in London: an example is the US financial services firm [[Citigroup]]. The Scottish capital, [[Edinburgh]], has one of the large financial centres of [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marklazarowicz.org.uk/parliament/speeches2003/4.30(WH).htm |title=Debate on Scottish financial services industry |first=Mark |last=Lazarowicz (Labour MP) |date=[[2003-04-30]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

The British manufacturing sector, however, has greatly diminished, relative to the economy as a whole, since World War II. It is still a significant part of the economy, but only accounted for one-sixth of national output in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/ministers/speeches/hewitt150704b.html |title=TUC Manufacturing Conference |author=Patricia Hewitt |publisher=Department for Trade and Industry |date=[[2004-07-15]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> The [[British motor industry]] is a significant part of this sector, although it has diminished with the collapse of [[MG Rover]] and most of the industry is foreign owned. Civil and defence aircraft production is led by the United Kingdom's largest aerospace firm, [[BAE Systems]], and the continental European firm [[EADS]], the owner of [[Airbus]]. [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] holds a major share of the global aerospace engines market. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is strong in the UK, with the world's second and sixth largest pharmaceutical firms ([[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[AstraZeneca]], respectively)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/sectors/biotech/pharmaceutical/page10219.html |title=The Pharmaceutical sector in the UK |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=Department of Trade and Industry}}</ref> being based in the UK.

The UK has a small [[coal]] reserve along with significant [[natural gas]], and [[oil reserves]].

Government involvement throughout the economy is exercised by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (currently [[Alistair Darling]]) who heads [[HM Treasury]], but the [[Prime Minister]] (currently ''The Rt Hon'' [[Gordon Brown]] MP), is [[First Lord of the Treasury]]; the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the Second Lord of the Treasury. However since 1997, the [[Bank of England]], headed by the [[Governor of the Bank of England]], has control of interest rates and other monetary policy.

As of 2007, United Kingdom's [[government debt]] rose to 43.3% of [[GDP]].<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html#Econ United Kingdom - Economy] CIA - The World Factbook</ref>

The currency of the UK is the [[pound sterling]], represented by the symbol '''[[Pound sign|£]]'''. The [[Bank of England]] is the [[central bank]], responsible for issuing currency. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover the issue. The UK chose not to join the [[euro]] at the currency's launch, and the British Prime Minister, ''The Rt Hon'' Gordon Brown MP, has ruled out membership for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2007-07-24]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2127640.ece |title=Puritanism comes too naturally for 'Huck' Brown |publisher=Times Online |accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref> The government of former Prime Minister Tony Blair had pledged to hold a public referendum for deciding membership should "[[five economic tests]]" be met.

Each country of the United Kingdom has a separate education system, with power over education matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved. Overall, the UK's official literacy rate (99%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3846.htm |title= Background Note: United Kingdom |publisher=US Department of State |date=January, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref>) is normal by developed country standards. The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], currently ranks the UK's education as the 14th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf]  However, fewer citizens of the UK are able to speak a foreign language than in any other EU country except Ireland. This has caused fear that the poor language skills in the UK will have a negative effect on business, and has led to calls for languages to be given priority in education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4442223.stm|title=news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4442223.stm<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6960432.stm|title=news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6960432.stm<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

The [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills]] is responsible to the UK Parliament for [[education in England]], though the day to day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of [[Local Education Authority|Local Education Authorities]]. Universal state education in England and Wales was introduced for primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humana.org/Article.asp?TxtID=223&SubMenuItemID=183&MenuItemID=43 |title=United Kingdom |publisher=Humana |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> Education is mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August). The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Despite a fall in actual numbers, the proportion of children in England attending [[private school]]s has risen to over 7%<ref>[http://education.guardian.co.uk/publicschools/story/0,,2208553,00.html Private school pupil numbers in decline] guardian.co.uk November 9th, 2007</ref>.

England has some of the top universities in the world with [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and [[University of London|London]] ranked amongst the top 20 in the 2007 [[THES - QS World University Rankings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/hybrid.asp?typeCode=144|title=The top 200 world universities|publisher=''Times Higher Education''|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref>

In [[Scotland]], the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning]] is responsible to the [[Scottish Parliament]] for education, with day to day administration and funding of state schools being the responsibility of Local Authorities. Scotland first legislated for universal provision of education in 1696. The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4% though it has been rising slowly in recent years.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6563167.stmIncrease in private school intake] BBC News April 17th, 2007</ref> Scottish students who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate endowment charges as the fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7268101.stm MSPs vote to scrap endowment fee] BBC News, February 28, 2008</ref>

The [[National Assembly for Wales]] has responsibility for [[education in Wales]]. A significant number of students in Wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and lessons in the language are compulsory for all until the age of 16. There are plans to increase the provision of Welsh Medium schools as part of the policy of having a fully bi-lingual Wales.

The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] is responsible for [[education in Northern Ireland]] though responsibility at a local level is administered by 5 Education and Library Boards covering different geographical areas.

== Healthcare ==

[[Image:NHS.svg|thumb|The NHS Logo for England]]
[[Image:NHS Scotland Logo.JPG|120px|right|thumb|The logo of NHS Scotland]]
Each country of the United Kingdom has a separate public healthcare system, with power over the provision of health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved. Each system provides healthcare to their citizens that is free at the point of need (being funded from general taxation).  Despite this similarity, considerable differences are now developing between the different systems.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] [[BBC]] [[January 2]] [[2008]]</ref> A much smaller private medical system also exists. Various regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the [[General Medical Council]], the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] and non-governmental-based (e.g. [[Royal College]]s). Across the UK, there is a large number of [[medical school]]s and [[dental school]]s, and a considerable establishment for training [[nurse]]s and professions allied to medicine, such as [[physiotherapy]], [[occupational therapy]], [[clinical psychology]] and [[radiography]]. The UK and devolved governments take on both the role of suppliers of public healthcare and assessors of the quality of its delivery through groups organised directly by government departments, such as [[NICE]] and [[CHI]].

Though the public health systems are commonly referred to as the NHS across the UK, in fact the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] just covers England.  The NHS was set up by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] and came into effect on July 5th 1948. The [[Secretary of State for Health]] is answerable to the UK Parliament for the running of the [[Department of Health]] and for the work of the NHS (in England). The NHS is one of the largest cohesive organisations of any type in the world employing over 1.3 million people.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6450303.stm NHS workforce 'falls by 11,000'] BBC News, March 14, 2007</ref> Public sector healthcare delivery consists of primary ([[General Practice]]), secondary ([[district general hospital]]) and tertiary ([[teaching hospital]]) levels of service.  There is considerable interaction and cross-flow between the various levels.

[[NHS Scotland]] provides public healthcare in Scotland with the [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing]]  responsible to the Scottish Parliament for the its work. In 2006, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff including more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. In addition, there were also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances.<ref>[http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/introduction.aspx About the NHS in Scotland] NHS Scotland</ref>

[[NHS Wales]] was originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] but powers over the NHS in Wales came under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969<ref>[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?pid=11595&orgid=452 Introduction to NHS Wales 1960's] www.wales.nhs.uk </ref>. In turn, responsibility for NHS Wales was passed to the Welsh Assembly and Executive under devolution in 1999.  NHS Wales provides public healthcare in Wales and employs some 90,000 staff, making it Wales’ biggest employer.<ref>[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?pid=11590&orgid=452 Introduction to NHS Wales - Staff] www.wales.nhs.uk </ref>The Minister for Health and Social Services is the person within the Welsh Assembly Government who holds cabinet responsibilities for both health and social care in Wales.

The [[Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety]] provides healthcare in Northern Ireland.

{{main|Transport in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Aircraft at LHR T3-2.JPG|thumb|[[Heathrow Airport]] is the [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|world's busiest airport]] in terms of numbers of international passengers.]]

The transport systems in the United Kingdom are the responsibility of each individual country. The English [[transport]] network is the responsibility of the UK [[Department for Transport]] (which also has responsibility for transport matters in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] which are not devolved.)  In Scotland, the [[Scottish Government's Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department]] is responsible for the Scottish [[transport]] network with [[Transport Scotland]] being the [[List of Scottish Executive agencies|Executive Agency]] that is accountable to the [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth]].<ref name='newcabinet'> {{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Scottish-Cabinet |title=Scottish Cabinet |accessdate=2007-05-26 |work=Scottish Executive }}</ref>

A radial road network of {{convert|46904|km|mi|0}} of main roads is centred on [[London]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Belfast]], whilst, in [[Great Britain]], a motorway network of {{convert|3497|km|mi|0}} is centred on [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]] and London. There are a further {{convert|213750|km|mi|0}} of paved roads.

The [[National Rail]] network of 16,116 km (10,072 miles) in Great Britain and 303&nbsp;route&nbsp;km (189 route&nbsp;mi) in [[Northern Ireland]] carries over 18,000 passenger trains and 1,000 freight trains daily. Urban rail networks are well developed in London and other cities. There was once over 48,000 route&nbsp;km (30,000 route&nbsp;mi) of rail network in the UK, however most of this was reduced over a time period from 1955 to 1975, much of it after a report by a government advisor [[Richard Beeching]] in the mid 1960s (known as the [[Beeching Axe]]).

[[Heathrow Airport]] is the world's busiest international [[airport]] and, being an island country, the UK has a considerable number of sea ports.

The Department for Transport states that [[traffic congestion]] is one of the most serious transport problems and that it could cost England an extra £22 billion in wasted time by 2025 if left unchecked.<ref>

[[Image:Wembley Stadium closeup.jpg|thumb|right|England's new [[Wembley Stadium]] is the most expensive stadium ever built costing £793 million ($1.6 billion).]]
Like many team sports, football is organised on a separate basis for each of the countries of the United Kingdom and each has its own Football Association, national team and [[league system]], though a few clubs play outside their country's respective systems for a variety of historical and logistical reasons.  [[Association football|Football]] was developed in the UK and is comfortably the most popular sport.

[[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] compete as separate countries in international competition and, as a consequence, the UK does not compete as a single team in football events at the [[Olympic Games]]. Although there are [[United Kingdom national football team|proposals to have a UK team]] take part in the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]], which are to be held in London, the [[Scottish FA|Scottish]], [[Welsh FA|Welsh]] and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Irish]] football associations have declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent status - a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/football/7286011.stm|title=Blatter against British 2012 team|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-03-09|accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>  England has been the most successful of the home nations, winning the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1966. 

The [[English football league system]] includes hundreds of inter-linked leagues, consisting of thousands of divisions. The [[FA Premier League]] is at the top, followed by The Football League and then the [[Football Conference]], where the structure starts to become regional and includes the [[Northern Premier League]], the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], the [[Isthmian League]] and more besides.  The [[English Premier League|Premiership]] is the most-watched football league in the world and is particularly popular in [[Asia]]; in the [[People's Republic of China]], matches attract television audiences between 100 million and 360 million, more than any other foreign sport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footy-live.com/Premiership.html |title=Footy Live |publisher=Live Sport Network |accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3207829.stm |title=Chinese phone maker's fancy footwork |publisher=BBC News |date=[[27 October]] [[2003]] |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> England is home to world-renowned football clubs such as [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. English teams have been successful in European Competitions including some who have become European Cup/UEFA Champions League winners: [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (five times), [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (twice), [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (twice) and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. More clubs from England have won the European Cup than any other country (four compared to three from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands). Moreover, England ranks second in the all time list of European club trophies won with 35, one behind Italy's 36. The European Cup competition itself was brought about due to the success of another English club, [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], against top European sides<ref>http://galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~mirad/archive.html EuroCups Archive</ref> in the 1950s.  The 90,000 capacity [[Wembley Stadium]] is the principal sporting stadium of England

[[Image:Hampden Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hampden Park]], Scotland]]
The [[Scottish football league system]] is much smaller, with just two national leagues: the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL) and the [[Scottish Football League]] which has three divisions. There are, however, other regional leagues that are not connected to the national system, most notably the [[Highland Football League]]. One English club, [[Berwick Rangers F.C.|Berwick Rangers]], plays in the Scottish system. Scotland is home to world-renowned football clubs such as [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Scottish teams that have been successful in European Competitions include [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] (European Cup in 1967), [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (European Cup Winners Cup 1972) and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] (European Cup Winners Cup and [[European Super Cup]] in 1983).

[[Image:Royal & Ancient Clubhouse.jpg|thumb|[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]], generally regarded as the world's "Home of Golf".]]
Both forms of rugby are national sports. [[Rugby League]] originates from and is generally played in the [[Northern England]], whilst [[Rugby Union]] is played predominantly in [[Wales]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Southern England]]. Though supposedly originating from the actions of [[William Webb Ellis]] at the School at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], it is now considered the national sport of Wales. In [[rugby league]] the UK has been represented by a single 'Great Britain' team but this will change for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup in which Scotland, England and Ireland will compete as separate nations.<ref>[http://www.rlwc08.com/ Official Website of Rugby League World Cup 2008]</ref>  This bring it into line with Rugby Union in which England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland (which consists of players from [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and Northern Ireland) already compete in international competition. However, every four years a [[British and Irish Lions]] team tours Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, composed of players selected from all the Home nations.

There is no UK-wide team in [[Cricket]]. The game was invented in [[England]] and the England Cricket Team, technically the England and Wales team, is the only national team in the UK with Test status. [[Sport in Ireland|Irish]] and [[Cricket in Scotland|Scottish]] players have played for [[England]] because neither Scotland nor Ireland have Test status and only play in One Day Internationals. As of 2006, teams representing [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]], [[England national cricket team|England (and Wales)]], and [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]] (including Northern Ireland) compete at the One-Day International level. England and Wales has a professional [[County Championship|league championship]] in which County teams compete.

[[Snooker]] is also one of Great Britain's sporting exports. A high-skill game similar to [[billiards]], the world championships are held annually in [[Sheffield]]. The sport continues to expand worldwide, with huge growth in China.

The game of [[tennis]] first originated from the City of [[Birmingham]] between 1859 and 1865. The [[Wimbledon Championships]] are international [[tennis]] events held in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in south London every summer and are regarded as the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar.

[[Thoroughbred racing]] is popular throughout the UK. It originated under [[Charles II of England]] as the "Sport of Kings" and is a royal pastime to this day. World-famous horse races include the [[Grand National]], the [[Epsom Derby]] and [[Royal Ascot]]. The town of [[Newmarket]] is considered the centre of English racing, largely due to the famous [[Newmarket Racecourse]].

The UK has proved successful in the international sporting arena in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. It is widely considered that the sport's most successful rower is [[Steven Redgrave]] who won five gold medals and one bronze medal at five consecutive [[Olympic Games]] as well as numerous wins at the [[World Rowing Championships]] and [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

Golf is one of the most popular participation sports played in the UK, with [[St Andrews]] in Scotland being the sport's home course. 

[[Shinty|Shinty (or ''camanachd'')]] (A sport derived from the same root as the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[hurling]] and similar to [[bandy]]) is popular in the [[Scottish Highlands]], sometimes attracting crowds numbering thousands in the most sparsely populated region of the UK.

The country is closely associated with [[motorsport]]. Many teams and drivers in [[Formula One]] (F1) are based in the UK and drivers from Britain have won more world titles than any other country. The country hosts legs of the F1 and [[World Rally Championship]] and has its own [[Touring Car Racing]] championship, the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC).
The [[British Grand Prix]] takes place at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] each July.

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of the United Kingdom}}
The origins of the UK as a [[political union]] of formerly [[Independence|independent]] countries has resulted in the preservation of distinctive cultures in each of the [[home nations]].

For details, see articles on:[[Culture of England]], [[Culture of Scotland]], [[Culture of Wales]], [[Culture of Northern Ireland]].

=== Cinema ===
{{main|Cinema of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has been influential in the development of cinema, with the [[Ealing Studios]] claiming to be the oldest studios in the world. Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry is characterised by an ongoing debate about its identity, and the influences of American and European cinema. The [[BFI Top 100 British films]] is a poll conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] which ranks what they consider to be the 100 greatest British films of all time.

The English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]] is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109536 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562101/Shakespeare.html |title=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/Shakespeare,+William |title=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref>

Among the earliest English writers are [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (12th century) , [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (14th century) , and [[Thomas Malory]] (15th century). In the 18th century, [[Samuel Richardson]] is often credited with inventing the modern novel. In the 19th century, there followed further innovation by [[Jane Austen]], the [[Brontë|Brontë sisters]], the social campaigner [[Charles Dickens]], the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] [[Thomas Hardy]], the visionary poet [[William Blake]] and romantic poet [[William Wordsworth]]. Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist [[H. G. Wells]], the controversial [[D. H. Lawrence]], the [[Modernists|modernist]] [[Virginia Woolf]], the prophetic novelist [[George Orwell]] and the poet [[John Betjeman]]. Most recently, the children's fantasy [[Harry Potter]] series by [[J. K. Rowling]] has recalled the popularity of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

Scotland's contribution includes the detective writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], romantic literature by [[Sir Walter Scott]], the epic adventures of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and the celebrated poet [[Robert Burns]]. More recently, the modernist and nationalist [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] and [[Neil M. Gunn]] contributed to the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. A more grim outlook is found in [[Ian Rankin]]'s stories and the psychological horror-comedy of [[Iain Banks]]. Scotland's capital, [[Edinburgh]], is UNESCO's first worldwide city of literature.

In the early medieval period, Welsh writers composed the [[Mabinogion]]. In modern times, the poets [[R.S. Thomas]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] have brought Welsh culture to an international audience.

Authors from other nationalities, particularly from Ireland, or from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, have lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]], and more recently British authors born abroad such as [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] and Sir [[Salman Rushdie]].

In theatre, Shakespeare's contemporaries [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]] added depth. More recently [[Alan Ayckbourn]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Michael Frayn]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism.

=== Media ===
{{main|Media in the United Kingdom}}
The prominence of the English language gives the UK media a widespread international dimension.

==== Broadcasting ====
{{main|Television in the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:Channel 4 Building - Horseferry Road - London - 310504.jpg|thumb|The Channel 4 building.]]
[[Image:BBC Television Centre.JPG|thumb|[[BBC Television Centre]]]]
The [[BBC]] is the UK's publicly funded [[radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. It operates several [[BBC Television|television channels]] and [[BBC Radio|radio]] stations in both the UK and abroad. The BBC's international television news service, [[BBC World]], is broadcast throughout the world and the [[BBC World Service]] radio network is broadcast in thirty-three languages globally, as well as services in the national language of Wales on [[BBC Radio Cymru]] and programmes in Scottish Gaelic in Scotland and Irish in Northern Ireland.

The domestic services of the BBC are funded by the [[television licence]], a legal requirement for any British household with a television receiver that is in use to receive broadcasts, regardless of whether or not the householders watch BBC channels. Households which are the principal residence of any person over 75 are exempt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/information/agedover74s.jsp|title=TV licensing: aged over 74}}</ref> and the requirement does not extend to radio listeners. The BBC World Service Radio is funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] and the television stations are operated by [[BBC Worldwide]] on a commercial subscription basis over cable and satellite services. It is this commercial arm of the BBC that forms half of [[UKTV]] along with [[Virgin Media]].
There are five major nationwide television channels in the UK: [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV1]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Five (channel)|Five]] - currently transmitted by analogue terrestrial, free-to-air signals with the latter three channels funded by commercial advertising. In Wales, [[S4/C]] the Welsh Fourth Channel replaces Channel 4, carrying Welsh language programmes at peak times. It also transmits Channel 4 programmes at other times. 

The UK now has a large number of digital terrestrial channels including a further six from the BBC, five from ITV and three from Channel 4, and one from S4/C which is solely in Welsh, among a variety of others.

The vast majority of digital [[Cable television|cable]] services are provided by [[Virgin Media]] with [[Satellite television|satellite]] being provided by [[BSkyB]] and [[free-to-air]] digital terrestrial television by [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]]. The entire country [[Digital switchover in the United Kingdom|will switch to digital]] by 2012.

[[Radio in the United Kingdom|Radio in the UK]] is dominated by [[BBC Radio]], which operates ten national networks and over forty local radio stations. The most popular radio station, by number of listeners, is [[BBC Radio 2]], closely followed by [[BBC Radio 1]]. There are hundreds of mainly local commercial radio stations across the country offering a variety of music or talk formats.

Traditionally, [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British newspapers]] could be split into ''quality'', serious-minded newspaper (usually referred to as "[[broadsheets]]" due to their large size) and the more populist, ''[[tabloid]]'' varieties. For convenience of reading, many traditional broadsheets have switched to a more [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]]-sized format, traditionally used by [[tabloid]]s. [[The Sun (newspaper)|''The Sun'']] has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper in the UK, with approximately a quarter of the market; its sister paper, ''[[The News of The World]]'' similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,1782,00.html |title=ABC Newspaper Circulation Figures |publisher=The Times |date=[[2006-05-12]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> and traditionally focuses on celebrity-led stories. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] broadsheet paper, has overtaken ''[[The Times]]'' (tabloid size format) as the highest-selling of the "quality" newspapers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.org.uk/
|title=Audit Bureau of Circulation Interactive Analysis National Newspaper Selection - Average Net Circulation (UK) 03-Jul-2006 to 30-Jul-2006 | accessdate=2006-09-04}} Lists the circulation of ''Daily Telegraph'' as 844,929 and ''The Times'' as 620,456.</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' is a more [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|liberal]]  "quality" broadsheet. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' is the main business paper, printed on distinctive salmon-pink broadsheet paper. 

First printed in 1737, the ''[[The News Letter|Belfast News Letter]]'' is the oldest known English-speaking daily newspaper still in publication today. One of its fellow Northern Irish competitors, ''[[The Irish News]]'', has been twice ranked as the best regional newspaper in the United Kingdom, in 2006 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newspaperawards.co.uk/default.htm |title=The Newspaper Awards |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>
Aside from newspapers, British magazines and journals have achieved worldwide circulation including ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. 

Scotland has a distinct tradition of newspaper readership (see [[List of newspapers in Scotland]]). The tabloid [[Daily Record]] has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper outselling the Scottish Sun by 4-1 while its sister paper, the [[Sunday Mail]] similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market. The leading "quality" daily newspaper in Scotland is [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]], though it is the [[Scotsman]]'s sister paper, the [[Scotland on Sunday]] that leads in the Sunday newspaper market. <ref>[http://www.business7.co.uk/business-news/breaking-business-news/2008/02/11/scottish-newspaper-readership-falls-97298-20316075/ Scottish newspaper readership falls] Business7, February 11, 2008</ref>

=== Music ===

{{main|British Music}}

'''Classical music:''' Notable composers from the United Kingdom have included [[William Byrd]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Sir Edward Elgar]], [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] (most famous for working with librettist [[Sir W. S. Gilbert]]), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and [[Benjamin Britten]], pioneer of modern British [[opera]]. London remains one of the major [[classical music]] capitals of the world.

[[Heavy metal]], [[hard rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[New Wave (music)|New Wave]] were among the variations that followed. In the early 1980s, UK bands from the [[New Romantic]] scene such as [[Duran Duran]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Spandau Ballet]], [[Soft Cell]] and [[Ultravox]] were prominent. In the 1990s, [[Britpop]] bands and [[electronica]] music attained international success. More recent pop acts, including [[The Smiths]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and the [[Spice Girls]], have ensured the continuation of the UK's massive contribution to popular music.

=== Philosophy ===
[[Image:David Hume.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[David Hume]] (1711 – 1776).]]

The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of "British Empiricism", a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid. The most famous philosophers of this tradition are [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]]. Britain is notable for a theory of moral philosophy, Utilitarianism, first used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and later by [[John Stuart Mill]], in his short work ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]''. Other eminent philosophers from the UK include [[William of Ockham]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Alfred Ayer]]. Foreign born philosophers who settled in the UK include [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

=== Science, engineering and innovation ===
{{seealso|Category:British inventors|Category:British inventions}}
[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|[[Sir Isaac Newton]]]]
The modern scientific method was promoted by the English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]] in the early seventeenth century, and subsequent advances credited to British scientists and engineers include:
* The [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and illumination of [[gravity]], by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] in the late 17th century
* The unification of electromagnetism, by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]
* The discovery of [[hydrogen]], by [[Henry Cavendish]]
* The [[steam locomotive]], by [[Richard Trevithick]] and [[Andrew Vivian]]

* The [[Turing machine]], by [[Alan Turing]], the basis of modern computers
* The structure of [[DNA]], by [[Francis Crick]] and others
* The development of the [[World Wide Web#Origins|World Wide Web]], largely attributed to [[Tim Berners-Lee]]

Notable [[civil engineering]] projects, whose pioneers included [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], contributed to the world's first national railway transport system. Other advances pioneered in the UK include the [[marine chronometer]], [[television]], the [[jet engine]], the modern [[bicycle]], [[electric lighting]], the [[electric motor]], the [[screw propeller]], the [[internal combustion engine]], military [[radar]], the electronic [[computer]], [[vaccination]] and [[antibiotics]].

Scientific journals produced in the UK include ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' and ''[[The Lancet]]''. In 2006, it was reported that the UK provided 9% of the world's scientific research papers and a 12% share of citations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,1736095,00.html |title=Britain second in world research rankings |publisher=The Guardian |date=[[2006-03-21]] |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref>

== Symbols ==

* The [[flag of the United Kingdom]] is the [[Union Flag]] commonly known as the "Union Jack". It was created by the superimposition of the flags of [[Flag of England|England]] ([[St George's Cross]]) and [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] ([[Saint Andrew's Cross]]), with the [[Saint Patrick's cross]], to represent Ireland, being added to this in 1801. [[Wales]] is not represented in the Union Flag as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom.  However, the possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7114248.stm Welsh dragon call for Union flag] BBC News, November 27, 2007 </ref>

There is no official National [[flag of Northern Ireland]] following the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]] or any unofficial flag universally supported in Northern Ireland. The use of various flags in Northern Ireland is contentious. However, the [[Ulster Banner]] is often used for sporting events. See [[Northern Ireland flags issue]] and [http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-04474.pdf The Union Flags and flags of the United Kingdom]</div>

* The [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom is "[[God Save the King]]", with "King" replaced with "Queen" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is female. The anthem's name, however, remains "God Save the King". The [[constituent countries]] of the UK also have a number of anthems with varying degrees of popular acceptance, the most popular being [[Flower of Scotland]], [[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]] in Wales, [[Londonderry Air]] in Northern Ireland and [[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]] in England.<ref>It is sometimes asserted by those used to a legislative tradition that "God Save the King/Queen" is not the actual national anthem of the United Kingdom — or sometimes that it is the de facto national anthem — because no law has ever been passed to say that that is the case. In the United Kingdom, however, such laws are unnecessary; custom, practice and proclamation are sufficient to establish it as the official national anthem.</ref>

[[Image:britannia2.jpg|thumb|The Statue of [[Britannia]] in [[Plymouth]].]]
* [[Britannia]] is a [[National personification|personification]] of the United Kingdom, originating from the [[Roman occupation of Britannia|Roman occupation]] of southern and central Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins |publisher=Chard |accessdate=2006-06-25}}</ref> Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a [[shield]], bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding the back of a lion. At and since the height of the British Empire, Britannia has often associated with maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song ''[[Rule Britannia]]''.

* The [[lion]] has been used as a symbol of the United Kingdom; one is depicted behind Britannia on the [[British fifty pence coin|50 pence]] piece and one is shown crowned on the back of the [[10p|10 pence]] piece. It is used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the [[British Army]]. Lions have been used as [[heraldic device]]s, including in the royal arms of the kingdoms of [[Coat of Arms of England|England]], [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in [[Wales]]. The lion is featured on the emblem of the [[England national football team]], giving rise to the popular football anthem ''[[Three Lions]]'', and the [[England national cricket team]]. The "three lions" on the English coat of arms were originally two leopards. An extra leopard was added by [[Richard the Lionheart]] and with the help of his name, they became known as three lions. They are now drawn to look more like lions. Leopards are traditionally depicted lying down whereas lions were drawn standing on all fours or up on their hind legs attacking, as in the Scottish [[Lion Rampant]].

* The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of [[Great Britain]], and is often associated with [[Winston Churchill]]'s defiance of Nazi Germany.

* Britain (especially England) has been personified as the character [[John Bull]], although this character is rarely used in modern times.

* Distinctive flora such as the [[oak]] tree and the [[rose]], have long been a widely used proxy for the visual representation of English identity. The red rose is the emblem of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[England national rugby union team]], the [[Rugby Football Union]] and [[Lancashire]]. The [[thistle]] is widely used as a Scottish symbol and the [[daffodil]] used as the Welsh.
