'''Southampton''' is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], [[unitary authority]] and major [[port]] situated on the south coast of [[England]]. It is the closest city to the [[New Forest]], situated approximately halfway between [[Portsmouth]] and [[Bournemouth]]. Southampton lies at the northern-most point of [[Southampton Water]] where it is joined by the [[River Test]] and [[River Itchen, Hampshire|River Itchen]], with the [[River Hamble]] joining to the south of the urban area. The city represents the core of the [[Greater Southampton]] region. The city's name is sometimes abbreviated in writing to "Soton", and a resident of Southampton is called a [[:Category:People from Southampton|Sotonian]].

==History==
{{main|History of Southampton}}

[[Image:Southampton-TitanicEngineersMemorial.jpg|thumb|The memorial to the engineers of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].]]
Although [[Stone Age]] settlements are known to have existed in the area, the first permanent settlement was established by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Known as ''Clausentum'', it was an important trading port for the large Roman towns of [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] and [[Salisbury, Wiltshire|Salisbury]].  The [[Anglo-Saxons]] moved the centre of the town across the [[River Itchen, Hampshire|Itchen]] to its present location, and it remained an important port. At the time, it was centred around what is now the St Mary's area, and the settlement was known as ''Hamwic'', which evolved into ''Hamtun'' and then ''Hampton''.  The Viking King [[Canute the Great]] is supposed to have defeated the Anglo-Saxon King [[Ethelred the Unready]] here in [[1014]] and been crowned here, and his fabled attempt to "command" the tide to halt may have taken place in Southampton. 

Southampton's prosperity was assured following the [[Norman Conquest]] in [[1066]], when it became the major port of transit between Winchester (then the capital of [[England]]) and [[Normandy]].  By the [[13th Century]], Southampton had become a leading port, and was particularly involved in the [[wool]] trade. The ''Wool House'' was built in [[1417]] as a warehouse for the medieval wool trade with [[Flanders]] and [[Italy]], the building surviving today as the Maritime Museum.  During the [[Middle Ages]], [[shipbuilding]] became an increasingly important industry, which was to remain for centuries to come.

[[English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|The town was sacked]] in [[1338]] by the French, including the pirate [[Grimaldi]], who used the plunder to help found the [[principality]] of [[Monaco]]. After this attack, the city walls were built, some of which remain as ruins today. Lacking proper finance for the construction of a full defensive wall, the townsfolk reached a compromise solution, which involved joining the existing exterior walls of existing merchant houses together to form part of the defensive structure. The city walls include ''God's House Tower'', built in [[1417]], the first purpose-built artillery fortification in England. Today, it is open as the Museum of Archaeology.

The 12th century Red Lion pub on the High Street, within the old walls, is where in 1415, immediately prior to King [[Henry V of England]]'s departure from Southampton to the [[Battle of Agincourt]], the ringleaders of the "[[Southampton Plot]]", [[Richard, Earl of Cambridge]], [[Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham]] and Sir [[Thomas Grey (1384-1415)|Thomas Grey of Heton]], were tried and found guilty of high treason, before being summarily executed outside the [[Bargate]].

The port was the original point of departure for the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] aboard the ''[[Mayflower]]'' in [[1623]]. A memorial can be found on Town Quay. Since that time it has been the last port of call for millions of emigrants who left the Old World to start a new life in the [[USA]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and other parts of the world.  In common with most of the luxury liners of the time, the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sailed from here, and it is still an important ocean liner port frequented by luxury ships such as the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''QE2'']], the [[MV Oriana (1995)|MV ''Oriana'']], and most recently the [[RMS Queen Mary 2|''Queen Mary 2'']]. The town contains several memorials and museum exhibitions related to the ''Titanic'', most of crew having come from Southampton; 549 Sotonians died in the sinking.

The city is home to Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' first permanent [[cenotaph]], a memorial to the city's dead of [[World War I]]. When it was unveiled on [[6 November]] 1920, it was 1800 names, later raised to 2008.  The Second World War hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as the major industrial area on the South Coast.  In particular, the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter aircraft was invented and manufactured in Southampton, a result of 1930s experimentation in the city. Bombing in two days in September 1940 killed 130 workers at the Woolston aircraft factory. There were many aircraft companies based around [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]], to the east of the city, from the 1930s to 1950s, including [[Folland|Folland Aviation]], now part of [[British Aerospace]], which built the [[BAE Hawk|Hawk]] and [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]]. [[BOAC]] had a [[flying boat]] base in the docks serving [[British Empire|British]] colonial possessions in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] in the 1930s and 1940s. It closed in 1950 when land based aircraft became dominant. Nearby, [[Calshot Spit]] was a base for the military flying boat services. 

Pockets of Georgian architecture survived the war, but much of the city was levelled. The accuracy of the locally-based Ordnance Survey's maps did not go unrecognised by the [[Luftwaffe]]: the German bomber pilots used them to bomb Southampton. One notable building to survive the bombings was Southampton's oldest, St. Michaels Church. Thought to have been commenced in 1070,<ref>http://www.hants.org.uk/sotoncitycentreparish/stmichael.htm - Retrieved 2004-04-08</ref> the building has been added to many times over the centuries but its central tower dates from Norman times. The spire was an important navigation aid for the German pilots and consequently they were ordered to avoid bombing it.<ref>http://www.wcities.com/en/record/,120885/206/record.html?event_name=&display=1 - Retrieved 2004-04-08</ref>

Southampton became a [[county corporate]] in [[1447]].  It was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].  The town became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], being expanded by the addition of several parishes in 1894, 1920, 1925 and 1967.  Southampton was awarded [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1964 by [[Letters Patent]].<ref>''City Status for Southampton''. The Times. February 12, 1964.</ref>  The boundaries have been largely unchanged since then, despite the loss of county borough status in 1974, and subsequent regaining of unitary authority status in 1996.

==Politics and administration==
Formerly a [[County Borough]] within the [[Counties of England|county]] of [[Hampshire]] (to which it gave its name, the ''County of Southampton'' or ''Southamptonshire'' - this was officially changed to ''Hampshire'' in 1959 though the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantscire for centuries), it became a [[non-metropolitan district]] in [[1974]]. However, the city became independent administratively from that county as it was made into a [[unitary authority]] in a local government re-organisation on [[1 April]] [[1997]]. The district remains part of the Hampshire [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]].

Southampton City Council consists of 48 councillors elected by thirds.  After the 2006 local council elections on [[May 4]], [[2006]]  the Council is split evenly 16 seats each to the [[Liberal Democrats]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  Currently the council is run by the Liberal Democrats with Labour support.

There are three [[Member of Parliament|members of parliament]] for the city: Rt Hon [[John Yorke Denham|John Denham]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]) for [[Southampton Itchen (UK Parliament constituency)|Southampton Itchen]] (constituency for the east of the city), Dr [[Alan Whitehead]] (Labour) for [[Southampton Test (UK Parliament constituency)|Southampton Test]] (the west of the city), and [[Sandra Gidley]] (Liberal Democrat) for [[Romsey]] (which includes a portion of the north of the city).

Southampton's police service is provided by [[Hampshire Constabulary]], its fire service by [[Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service]] and the ambulance service by the [[South Central Ambulance Service]].  Police stations within the city boundaries can be found in [[Portswood]], [[Bitterne]], and [[Shirley, Hampshire|Shirley]], as well as at the Civic Centre in the [[Southampton City Centre|city centre]].  Fire stations are located in [[St Mary's, Hampshire|St Mary's]], [[Sholing]] and [[Redbridge, Hampshire|Redbridge]].

Southampton has always been strongly connected with [[Shipping|maritime]] history and developments, and the docks have long been a major employer in the city. In particular, it is a primary port for [[cruise ships]], its heyday being the first half of the [[20th century]], and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Today it remains home to many luxury liners, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast, with several [[container (cargo)|container]] terminals.  Unlike many other ports, such as [[Liverpool]], [[London]], and [[Bristol]], where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry.  Part of the docks have been redeveloped, however as the [[Ocean Village (marina)|Ocean Village]] development, a local [[marina]] and entertainment complex. 

Other major employers in the city include [[Ordnance Survey]], the UK's national mapping agency, whose headquarters are in the city.   The [[Lloyd's Register|Lloyd's Register Group]] has announced plans to move its London marine operations to a specially developed site at the University of Southampton.<ref>{{citeweb

Southampton's largest retail centre is the West Quay Shopping Centre. Opened in Early 2000 and hosting major High Street Brands it is one of the largest in the country.  The centre is scheduled to undergo phase 3 of its development in 2008, with plans to build more shops, housing, offices, the HQ for [[Carnival Cruises]] and leisure facilities.  A decision as to what leisure facilities is still to be decided, however Southampton was granted a large Legalised Gambling status and so can now add to its collection of casinos in the city. Swedish low-cost home products retailer [[IKEA]], is planing to open a store in the city centre sometime in 2008<sup>[http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/southampton.html].</sup> Overall, Southampton is ranked 7th for shopping in the [[UK]]

Like many cities in the UK, Southampton's strong economy is promoting redevelopment, and major projects are proposed, including the city's first skyscrapers on the waterfront. The three towers proposed will each stand 23 stories high and will be surrounded by smaller apartment blocks, office blocks and shops which will help to solve the Southcoasts shortage of housing.  Finally a large Hotel is to be built on the waterfront to try to reclaim the BT Global Challenge from rivals [[Portsmouth]].

Southampton is unique in being the only city in the UK with a [[Geothermal power in the United Kingdom|geothermal power station]]. The station provides hot water to a city centre [[district heating]] scheme.  In a recent survey of carbon emissions in major UK cities conducted by British Gas, Southampton was ranked as being one of the lowest [[carbon emissions|carbon emitting]] cities in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{citeweb

It is also home to the [[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton]], the focus of [[Natural Environment Research Council]]-funded [[marine (ocean)|marine]] research.

==Transport==
As befits Southampton's role as a major port, the city has good transport links with the rest of the country. The [[M27 motorway]], linking places along the south coast of England, runs just to the north of the city. The [[M3 motorway]] links the city to [[London]] and also, by linking to the [[A34 road]] at [[Winchester]] with the Midlands and North. The [[M271 motorway]] links the [[M27 motorway|M27]] with the Western Docks and city centre.

Southampton is also well served by the [[Network Rail|rail network]], used by both freight services to and from the docks, and passenger services as part of the [[National Rail|national rail]] system. The main station in the city is [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton Central]]. Routes run eastwards to [[Portsmouth]] and [[Brighton]], north-east to [[Winchester]] and [[London]], north to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Birmingham]] and beyond, north-west to [[Salisbury]], [[Bristol]] and [[Cardiff]] and west to [[Bournemouth]], [[Poole]] and [[Weymouth]]. Southampton Coach Station was refurbished recently, and the range and frequency of services offered by the [[National Express Group]] increased to make use of the new facilities.

[[Southampton Airport]] is a regional airport located in the town of [[Eastleigh]], just north of Southampton. It is connected to the city by a frequent rail [[Uni-link#U1|and bus]] service, and hosts flights to UK and near European destinations.

Whilst Southampton is no longer the base for any cross-channel ferries, it is the terminus for three internal [[ferry]] services, all of which operate from terminals at Town Quay. Two of these, a [[RORO|car ferry]] service and a fast [[catamaran]] passenger ferry service, provide links to [[Cowes|East Cowes]] and [[Cowes]] respectivlyon the [[Isle of Wight]] and are operated by [[Red Funnel]]. The third ferry is the [[Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry|Hythe Ferry]], providing a passenger service to the town of [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] on the other side of [[Southampton Water]]. Town Quay is linked to Southampton Central station by a [[Uni-link#City-link shuttle service|free bus service]].

Local transport is largely road based, with significant peak hour congestion in the city. The main [[bus]] operators are [[First Group|First]], [[Solent Blue Line]] (who also operate the [[BlueStar]] service) and [[Uni-link]], although other operators also run services into the city, including [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] and [[Wilts and Dorset]]. There is also a door to door minibus service (Southampton Dial a Ride) for residents who cannot access public transport, this is funded by the City Council and operated by [[SCA Support Services]]. There is also a small circular route that surrounds the city centre called [[City Clipper]]. However, local train services do operate in the central, Southern and Eastern sections of the city, serving [[Swaythling]], [[St. Denys, Southampton|St. Denys]], [[Millbrook, Hampshire|Millbrook]], [[Redbridge]], [[Bitterne]], [[Sholing]] and [[Woolston, Southampton|Woolston]].

The Uni-link bus service was commissioned by the [[University of Southampton]] to provide access to students who are studying at the university to all parts of the city. The buses run from early in the morning to midnight meeting demands of students who wish to get to the city during the day and leisure places in the evening.

== Areas and suburbs ==

Southampton is subdivided into several council wards, suburbs, constituencies, ecclesiastical parishes, and other less formal areas.

Southampton is named the 'Green City' as it is graced with many green spaces and parks. Standing in any area of Southampton, if you turn 360 degrees you will see at least one form of greenery. The largest green space is [[Southampton Common]], parts of which are used to host the annual summer festivals, circuses and fun fairs. The Common covers a larger area than Hyde Park in London and includes a Wildlife Centre on the former site of Southampton Zoo, a swimming pool and several lakes and ponds. The city also boasts the Southampton Sports Centre which is the focal point for the public's sporting and outdoor activities and includes an Alpine Centre, Theme Park and Athletics Centre used by professional athletes. As with most cities there are several council estates such as those in the [[Weston, Southampton|Weston]] district.
