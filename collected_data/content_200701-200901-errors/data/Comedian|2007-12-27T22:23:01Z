A '''comedian''', or '''comic''', is a performer who entertains an audience by making them laugh. This might be through [[joke]]s or amusing situations, or acting the fool, as in [[slapstick]], or employing [[prop comedy]]. A comedian who stands and addresses an audience directly is called a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comic]].

Since the mid-1980s, a new wave of comedy, called [[alternative comedy]], has been gaining popularity with its offbeat style. This normally involves more experiential, or observational reporting, i.e. [[Andy Kaufman]].

Formats of a comedian's show are flexible and often depend on the type of [[comedy]]. Some comedians like [[Brian Figarol]] and [[Jack Tzianabos]] speak about their own day to day lives, while others like [[Frank Skinner]] sing humorous songs.

As far as content is concerned, comedians such as [[Tommy Tiernan]] draw on their background to poke fun at themselves, while others such as [[Bill Maher]] and [[George Carlin]] have strong political and cultural undertones.

Many comics achieve a [[cult following]] while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] in [[Australia]]. Often a comic's career is made when they win a notable comedy prize, such as the now defunct [[Perrier Award]]. Comics typically survive by continuous touring and foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, when they have become famous.
