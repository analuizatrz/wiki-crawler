The '''Smolensk War''' (Polish-Russian 1632-1634) was a conflict fought in the years [[1632]]-[[1634]] between the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Tsardom of Russia]].  After recovering to a certain extent from the [[Time of Troubles]], Russia, expecting the Commonwealth to be weakened by the death of king [[Sigismund III Vasa]], launched the war in an attempt to gain control of the key city of [[Smolensk]] which it ceded to the Commonwealth in [[1618]] at the [[Truce of Deulino]], ending the [[Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618)|Polish-Russian War (1605-1618)]] war. Smolensk was often contested and changed hands many times in the course of the 15th to 17th centuries.

A large, carefully prepared Russian army of 34,500 men under [[Mikhail Borisovich Shein]] reached Smolensk in October of [[1632]] and began a siege. The city held out for the following year while the Commonwealth, under its newly elected king [[Wladislaus IV of Poland|Wladislaus IV]], organised a relief force.  This force, led personally by the king, finally arrived near Smolensk in September of [[1633]] and began immediate operations against the besieging forces. 

In a series of fierce combats, the Russians were first forced to break their siege of Smolensk by [[October 3]], and then by the end the month were themselves surrounded by [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Commonwealth military|forces of the Commonwealth]]. The surrounded Russians waited for relief but none arrived. Finally they surrendered on [[March 1]], [[1634]]. The war ended soon afterwards with the [[Treaty of Polanów]] signed in May of [[1634]]. The peace treaty confirmed the [[status quo ante bellum|pre-war status quo]], with Russia paying a large [[war indemnity]] (20,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] in gold), while Wladislaus IV agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow.

The treaty ended the almost unbroken series of wars between the Commonwealth and its neighbours which took place since the start of the [[17th century]]. The 14 years of peace that followed were arguably the most prosperous in Commonwealth's history.
