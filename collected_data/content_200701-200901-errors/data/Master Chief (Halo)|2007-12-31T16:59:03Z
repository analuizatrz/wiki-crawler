'''Master Chief Petty Officer John-117''', commonly called '''Master Chief''', is the protagonist of the fictional [[Halo universe|''Halo'' universe]], created by [[Bungie Studios]], and is a [[player character]] in the trilogy of science fiction [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]]s ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'',  ''[[Halo 2]]'', and ''[[Halo 3]]''. Outside of video games, the Master Chief appears in the novels ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', and has cameos in ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'' and the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]''. He is voiced by Chicago [[disc jockey]] [[Steve Downes]] in the video games in which he appears.

The Master Chief is one of the most visible symbols of the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]]. Originally designed by Marcus Lehto, Rob McLees, and Shi Kai Wang, the character is a towering and faceless [[cybernetics|cybernetically]] enhanced supersoldier; he is never seen without his armor or helmet. The character has been called an icon, a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as [[Mario]], [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], and [[Lara Croft]].<ref name="businessweek">Snow, 1.</ref> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' named the Master Chief as the eighth greatest video game character ever. Conversely, the Chief's silent nature during gameplay has led to criticisms that the character is one-dimensional and unbelievable.

==Character design==
[[Image:Masterchief sheik.png|thumb|right|upright|Shi Kai Wang's sketch which became the basis for the Master Chief]]
The task of developing the Master Chief for the character's first appearance in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' fell on Rob McLees and the project's Art Director, Marcus Lehto. Eventually, Shi Kai Wang was hired for conceptual art.<ref name="aoh20">Trautman, 20.</ref> One of Wang's sketches was accepted and became the basis for the Master Chief. However, after Wang's version was converted to a 3-D model, it was decided the character looked too slender, "almost effeminate".<ref name=aoh20 /> The Master Chief was subsequently bulked up to the version currently found in the games.<ref name=aoh20 /> Similarly, the Chief's armor went through various changes, such as the addition of an antenna, which was removed later in development, and a green tint.<ref>"One Million Years B.X.".</ref>

In an interview on creating believable video game characters, Bungie's [[Joseph Staten]] noted that, until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not considered how to immerse people in the world of ''Halo''. "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," he said, "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor."<ref>Cifaldi.</ref>

[[Steve Downes]], who voices the Master Chief, is a disc jockey and voice actor who had never played video games before ''Halo''.<ref name=interview1/> [[Martin O'Donnell]], Bungie's music director, had worked with Downes on a previous video game, ''[[Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator]]'', and recommended him for the part.<ref>KLind.</ref> Downes has never appeared at Bungie or Microsoft events, and believes that the Master Chief is left masked because "[the character's identity] is really in the eye of the player".<ref>XerxdeeJ, "A Visit from the Master Chief Himself", Part 2.</ref>

==Attributes==
===Personality===
Steve Downes said that his voice acting was based entirely on Bungie's written character description provided , which specified a character similar to [[Clint Eastwood]] and of few words. In a [[podcast]] interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, he was given a fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality.<ref name="interview1">XerxdeeJ, "A Visit from the Master Chief Himself", Part 1.</ref> In the games, the Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him almost a [[silent protagonist]]. Even during cutscenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [and] apply their own personality."<ref name="frank">Kolan.</ref>  Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described the Master Chief as "pretty much the consummate professional.  He does his job, walks off, doesn't even get the girl, he's that cool he doesn't need her."<ref>Bungie Studios 2004, ''Halo 2 Limited Collector's Edition Bonus DVD''.</ref> Although the Master Chief is usually depicted as calm, quiet, and wryly cynical, some reviewers stated that Eric Nylund's portrayal of the character in ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'' deviates significantly from the treatment found in the games and other media.<ref>Park; Pezzano.</ref>

Entirely encased in heavy armor and standing seven feet tall, the Chief inspires awe and terror in friends and foes alike.<ref>Dietz, 15.</ref> Despite his cold exterior, Master Chief cares about his fellow soldiers, especially the Spartan-IIs with whom he has trained.<ref>Dietz, 18.</ref> At one point, the Master Chief risks injury in a massive explosion to save a fellow Spartan,<ref>Nylund 2003, 324.</ref> and withholds some combat information on the threat of the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]], an alien parasite, after realizing that its disclosure would mean the death of [[Sergeant Major A.J. Johnson|Sergeant Avery Johnson]].<ref>Nylund 2003, 339.</ref>

During his training, the Master Chief is taught by [[Chief Petty Officer]] [[List of Halo characters#Franklin Mendez|Franklin Mendez]] to sacrifice lives only when necessary and to understand the difference between "wasting lives and spending lives."<ref>Nylund 2001, 63.</ref> While in the Chi Ceti system, one of the Master Chief's fellow Spartans and best friend, Samuel-034, suffers an irreparable breach in his armor.<ref>Nylund 2001, 127â€“28.</ref> Sam stays behind to detonate explosives, while the Master Chief and another comrade evacuate the ship. Although the Chief would have preferred to die with his friend, he tells himself that he needs to "live and fight another day".<ref>Nylund 2001, 129.</ref> In ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', [[List of Halo characters#Catherine Halsey|Dr. Catherine Halsey]] tries to teach him to save every single life possible.<ref>Nylund 2001. 245.</ref>

Despite the Master Chief's excellent combat record, many in the [[United Nations Space Command]] (UNSC), the military unit to which he belongs, distrust him. [[Characters in the Halo series#Antonio Silva|Antonio Silva]], an [[United Nations Space Command#Orbital Drop Shock Troopers|Orbital Drop Shock Trooper]], exemplifies this attitude,<ref>Nylund 2003, 54</ref> and considers the Master Chief a freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet.<ref>Dietz, 81.</ref> Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor said in an interview that revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.<ref name="frank" />

===Outward appearance===
In the video games, the Master Chief is never seen without his armor. In the final cutscene of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Chief removes his helmet, but camera movement hides his face. Bungie did this to help the player identify with the Chief.<ref name="time">Grossman.</ref> The only physical description of the Master Chief comes from the novels. During a briefing scene in ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', the Chief is described as tall with short hair, serious eyes, and strong features. His skin is "too white", a consequence of spending most of his time in his armor.<ref name="tf80">Dietz, 80.</ref> The Master Chief stands about seven&nbsp;feet (2.13&nbsp;m) tall and weighs 1,000 pounds (450&nbsp;kg) in armor;<ref>Bungie, ''Halo 2'' Instruction Manual.</ref> without it, he stands six&nbsp;feet, six&nbsp;inches (1.98&nbsp;m) tall and weighs 287&nbsp;pounds (130&nbsp;kg).<ref>Nylund 2001, 205.</ref>

===''Halo: The Fall of Reach''===
{{seealso|Halo: The Fall of Reach}}
The Master Chief's backstory is never explained in the video games. A prequel of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the 2001 novel ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach|The Fall of Reach]]'', reveals much of the character's history and was released as a companion to the game. The Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and first lived with his family on the human colony planet Eridanus 2. Large for his six years of age, and approximately a foot above his school peers, he is described as a typical boy with brown hair, freckles and a gap between his two front teeth.<ref>Nylund 2001, 24.</ref> In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with [[United Nations Space Command#Flash clones|flash clones]] to hide the kidnapping. The original children are brought to planet [[Reach (Halo)|Reach]], one of the UNSC's headquarters, to begin intense physical and psychological training to become [[SPARTAN-II Project|SPARTAN-II]] supersoldiers.<ref>Nylund 2001, 35.</ref> They are assigned new identification numbers instead of last names; John becomes known as John-117. Approximately eight years later, John and the other children are biologically and [[cybernetics|cybernetically]] augmented and enhanced. These procedures had substantial risks;<ref>Nylund 2001, 56.</ref> only John and thirty-two other Spartans survive.<ref>Nylund 2001, 60.</ref>

After the Spartans' first successful operation, John-117 is briefed on the threat posed by the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship.<ref>Nylund 2001, 94.</ref> The Spartans are first sent to the Damascus Materials Testing Facility on the planet Chi Ceti 4 to retrieve the [[MJOLNIR battle armor|MJOLNIR Mark IV armor]]. In the process, they board a Covenant vessel and plant a bomb; John is forced to leave one of his fellow Spartans, his best friend, to die.<ref>Nylund 2001, 124.</ref>

In 2552, the Covenant invades the human world of Sigma Octanus and occupies one of its cities, Cote D'Azure.<ref>Nylund 2001, 147.</ref> Following a failed Marine assault, John-117 and three teams of Spartans are sent to destroy the Covenant force with a nuclear warhead. After detonating the weapon, the Spartans return to [[Halo universe#Reach|Reach]], where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant [[Covenant (Halo)#Prophets|High Prophet]], who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce.<ref>Nylund 2001, 225.</ref> The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) [[Cortana]] during a training mission.<ref>Nylund 2001, 240.</ref> A massive Covenant armada of 314 ships<ref>'''Cortana''': Fifteen Covenant capital ships, holding position just outside the killzone. / '''Lord Hood''': Something's not right.

Aboard the spaceship ''Pillar of Autumn'', Cortana plots a random course of escape.<ref>Bungie Studios 2001, ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' Instruction Manual, 14.</ref> Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters [[cryonics|cryonic sleep]] along with the ''Pillar of Autumn''{{'}}s crew.

[[Image:Masterchief-and-company.png|thumb|right|The Master Chief (left), [[Cortana]], and [[Characters in the Halo series#Jacob Keyes|Captain Keyes]] aboard the ''Pillar of Autumn'']]
The Master Chief first appears in the games as the [[protagonist]] of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. In ''Halo: The Flood'', the 2003 novelization of the video game, the Chief is likewise the main character. During the opening cinematic of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. Upon exiting [[slipspace]], the ''[[Pillar of Autumn]]'' is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]], a ring-shaped megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via lifeboat. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, the Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]], as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]].<ref name="bigblow">'''Cortana''': You have no idea how this ring works, do you? Why the forerunners built it? Halo doesn't kill Flood, it kills their food. Humans, Covenant, whatever. We're all equally edible. The only way to stop the Flood is to starve them to death. And that's exactly what Halo is designed to do: wipe the galaxy clean of all sentient life. You don't believe me? Ask him. / '''Master Chief''': Is this true? / '''343 Guilty Spark''': More or less. Technically, this installation's pulse has a maximum effective radius of twenty-five thousand light years. But, once the others follow suit, this galaxy will be quite devoid of life, or at least any life with sufficient biomass to sustain the Flood. - ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', "Two Betrayals".</ref> The Covenant accidentally releases the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Someone has released the Flood. My function is to prevent it from leaving this installation. - ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', "343 Guilty Spark".</ref> At the request of the installation's resident AI [[343 Guilty Spark]], the Master Chief retrieves the Index, a device used to activate Halo's defenses and eliminate the Flood. However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving the Flood to death.<ref name="bigblow" /> Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo. She and the Master Chief destroy it<ref>'''Cortana''': We can't let the monitor activate Halo. We have to stop him. We have to destroy Halo. - ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', "Two Betrayals".</ref> by detonating the ''Pillar of Autumn''{{'}}s fusion reactor core. The Master Chief and Cortana escape in a human fighter spaceship, and believe that they are the only survivors.<ref>Dietz, 300; '''Master Chief''': Did anyone else make it? / '''Cortana''': Scanning. (Pause) Just... dust and echoes. We are all that's left. - ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', "The Maw".</ref>

===''Halo: First Strike''===
{{see also|Halo: First Strike}}
''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', the 2003 novel by [[Eric Nylund]], follows the Master Chief after the events of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' and bridges the events of ''Halo'' and ''Halo 2''. Floating in Halo's debris field, Cortana and the Chief discover that there are in fact other human survivors.<ref>Nylund 2003, 45.</ref> The Master Chief and these soldiers capture the Covenant flagship ''Ascendant Justice'', and return to Reach to contact Earth's High Command. At Reach, the Master Chief discovers that the Covenant had not destroyed the planet's [[biosphere]] in the usual manner, and that a few other Spartans survive. The Chief retrieves [[Characters in the Halo series#Catherine Halsey|Dr. Catherine Halsey]], the creative genius behind the [[SPARTAN-II Project]], and his fellow soldiers. The Spartans then attack a massive Covenant command station, the ''Unyielding Hierophant'', thus delaying a Covenant assault on Earth.<ref>Nylund 2003, 332.</ref>

===''Halo 2''===
{{see also|Halo 2}}
[[Image:Masterchief halo2 delta.png|thumb|right|The Master Chief lands on the surface of [[Delta Halo]].]]
The Master Chief returns as one of two playable characters in ''[[Halo 2]]'', the 2004 sequel to ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. Returning to Earth with heavily damaged armor, the Master Chief receives an upgrade. Aboard Cairo Station in space, he attends a brief awards ceremony, which is interrupted by a Covenant invasion. Master Chief is commanded to protect the station.<ref>'''Lord Hood''': They're going to try to take our MAC guns offline, give their capital ships a straight shot at Earth. Master Chiefâ€¦defend this station. - ''Halo 2'', "Cairo Station".</ref> The Covenant is repelled, and the Master Chief joins the ship ''[[In Amber Clad]]'' to fight the Covenant on Earth's surface, in New Mombasa. As the Covenant departs via [[Slipstream (science fiction)|slipspace]], the ''In Amber Clad'' follows them to [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 05|Installation 05]], another Halo. The Master Chief lands on this Halo and subsequently [[assassination|assassinates]] the Covenant [[Hierarchs (Halo)|High Prophet]] of Regret. Emerging from a structure, the Master Chief is attacked by orbiting Covenant forces, but is rescued by the [[Gravemind]], an intelligence of [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] origin. The Gravemind sends him to [[High Charity]] to search for Delta Halo's Index.<ref>'''Gravemind''': If you will not hear the truth, then I will show it to you. There is still time to stop the key from turning, but first it must be found. You will search one likely spot... and you will search another. Fate had us meet as foes, but this ring will make us brothers. - ''Halo 2'', "Gravemind".</ref> Subsequently, the Master Chief boards a [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] ship bound for Earth, intending to "finish the fight".

===''Halo: Uprising'' and ''Halo 3''===
{{see also|Halo: Uprising|Halo 3}}
The Master Chief appears as a main character in Marvel's [[limited series]] ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', in which he breaks into a Covenant-held Forerunner structure before being captured by the Covenant.<ref>Bendis, 20.</ref> Like ''First Strike'', the comic serves as a bridge between two video games, ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3'', in which Master Chief is again the main character.

Back on Earth, the Master Chief helps to repel hostile Covenant forces from [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Voi]]. With the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] (a [[Covenant Elite]] who has sided with humanity) and fellow allies, the Chief leads the assault on a [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] artifact that the Covenant [[Hierarchs (Halo)#High Prophet of Truth|Prophet of Truth]] is attempting to activate. Soon after Truth escapes Earth through the slipspace portal opened by the artifact, the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] invade Earth.<ref>'''Arbiter''': What is it? More Brutes? / '''Master Chief''': Worse. / '''Miranda Keyes''': The Flood. It's spreading all over the city. - ''Halo 3'', "Floodgate".</ref> After helping to control the infestation, the Master Chief follows Truth to the Ark, an immense constructed world more than 262,144&nbsp;[[light-year]]s from the center of the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] and well beyond the range of any Halo.<ref>'''Master Chief''': That's our galaxy, we're beyond the rim. / '''343 Guilty Spark''': Two to the eighteenth lightyears from galactic center, to be precise.  - ''Halo 3'', "The Ark"; '''343 Guilty Spark''': The Ark is out of range of all the active installations!  - ''Halo 3'', "The Covenant".</ref> There, all the [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]]s can be remotely activated, thus killing all sentient life that could be infested by the Flood.<ref name="bigblow" /> It is discovered that a new Halo is being constructed to replace the one that the Master Chief destroyed in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The Flood follow the Chief to the Ark, bringing ''[[High Charity]]'' through the slipspace portal to escape the range of the six original Halos. The allied [[Covenant Elite|Elite]]s and humans decide to activate the ''new'' Halo in order to kill the Flood outside the galaxy, and thus preserve life there. 343 Guilty Spark opposes the premature activation of the incomplete installation and attempts to stop it. The Master Chief destroys him, activates the ring, and escapes with Cortana and the Arbiter on the UNSC frigate ''Forward Unto Dawn''. During the escape, the collapsing slipspace portal severs the ''Dawn'' in two, stranding Cortana and the Master Chief deep in space. While the Arbiter returns to Earth, Cortana activates a distress beacon, knowing that rescue could take years; the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana, "Wake me when you need me."<ref>Bungie Studios, 2007, ''Halo 3'', "Halo".</ref>

==Appearances in other media==
The Master Chief has appeared or has been referenced several times in non-canon media. [[Team Ninja]] originally approached [[Bungie Studios]] and asked to use the Master Chief in their 2006 video game ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]''. Although the Chief was not used, Bungie's interest in the idea resulted in the development of [[Nicole (Dead or Alive character)|Nicole (Spartan-458)]].<ref>"Dead or Alive 4 Q&A.</ref>

The Master Chief is mentioned several times in [[Rooster Teeth Productions]]' ''Halo''-based [[machinima]] parody series ''[[Red vs. Blue]]''. In the first episode of the series, [[Grif]], talking to teammate {{rvbchar|Simmons}}, says: "I signed up to fight some aliens. Next thing I know, Master Chief blows up the whole Covenant Armada, and I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere, fighting {{rvbchar|Blue Team|a bunch of blue guys}}."<ref>Rooster Teeth Productions 2003.</ref> In the Halo Zune exclusive video titled "[[List of Red vs. Blue special episodes#Halo 3 Zune video|Turn On, Tune In, Zune Out]]", [[List of characters in Red vs. Blue#Doc|Doc]] has a segment on his radio broadcast called "You're not Master Chief, and that's okay".<ref>Rooster Teeth Productions 2007; Kelly.</ref>

The Master Chief is referenced as a hero by a then-retired soldier in the live-action short, "[[Marketing for Halo 3#"The Museum"|The Museum]]",<ref>McElroy.</ref> and appears in the [[Marketing for Halo 3#"Believe"|subsequent video]] as part of a special advertisement series for ''[[Halo 3]]'' entitled "Believe in a Hero".<ref>Swilinski.</ref>

==Impact and reception==
In an article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[Lev Grossman]] stated that the Master Chief represents a "new kind of celebrity for a new and profoundly weird millennium" and is a symbol of the increasing legitimacy of video games as an art form.<ref name="time" /> ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' simply described the Chief as "iconic".<ref>Moses.</ref> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' noted that the Master Chief, in half a decade had become the [[de facto]] symbol for the [[Xbox]] and for a new generation of gamers.<ref>EGM staff.</ref> The recognition of the Master Chief has spread to mainstream culture; [[Madame Tussauds]] in [[Las Vegas]] has developed a wax sculpture of the Chief. At the ceremony, [[Pete Wentz]] of [[Fall Out Boy]] said that the "Master Chief is as much of a hero today as characters like [[Spider-Man]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and [[Luke Skywalker]] were for previous generations."<ref>"Master Chief Invades Madame Tussauds".</ref>

[[Image:Bill Gates Master Chief.jpg|thumb|An actor dressed as the Master Chief stands with [[Bill Gates]] at the ''Halo 3'' launch at [[Best Buy]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/66327609@N00/1438040968/|title=Halo 3 Midnight Madness Bellevue Best Buy 274 on Flickr - Photo Sharing!|accessdate=2007-10-10|author=[http://www.flickr.com/people/gamerscore/ Microsoft Games Global Marketing (gamerscoreblog)]|date=2007-09-25|work=[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gamerscore/ Flickr: Photos from gamerscoreblog]|publisher=[[Flickr]]|quote=Taken on [[September 25]], [[2007]]}}</ref>]]
''[[BusinessWeek]]'' listed the Master Chief among several video game characters who have been branded beyond their respective video games, "helping them transcend the very medium in the process".<ref name="businessweek" /> The Master Chief has been used in marketing on a variety of products, from [[7-Eleven]] [[Slurpee]]s to T-shirts, [[Xbox 360]] controllers, and [[Mountain Dew]].<ref>Brudvig; "Reserve Halo 3 at 7-11 TODAY!".</ref> Several [[action figure]]s of the character have been created to market of the ''Halo'' series; the most recent were manufactured by McFarlane.<ref>Plunkett.</ref> These actions have been called necessary to the game franchise; Ed Ventura, director of Xbox's worldwide marketing, said, "We want to be in the hearts and minds of our fans as much as we can."<ref>High.</ref>

[[Roger Travis]], associate professor of classics at the [[University of Connecticut]], compared the Master Chief to the epic hero [[Aeneas]], in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating strong enemies in a martial setting. The audience is intended to become immersed and to identify with the protagonist similarly in both stories.<ref>Travis.</ref> [[Matthew Stover]]  compared ''Halo'' to the ''[[Iliad]]'', saying that both stories share the meta-theme that "war is the crucible of character". As [[military science fiction]], ''Halo'' further raises the issue of being human.<ref>Stover, 1â€“3.</ref> Stover argued that, since players are to imagine themselves as the Master Chief, the character is correctly presented as a [[cyborg]], neither a flawless machine nor fully human. Players would be unable to empathize with the former, and the latter would be too specifically developed.<ref>Stover, 8â€“9.</ref>

[[IGN]] saw in the Master Chief elements of Jon 6725416, a character in [[Christopher Rowley]]'s novel ''Starhammer''.<ref>Perry, 5.</ref> Reviewers have suggested that the name John-117 could be a Biblical reference.<ref>Perry 5; Park.</ref>

Reaction to the Master Chief as a character is generally mixed. Some reviewers see the character's silent nature as a strength;<ref>Park.</ref> others say that this quality leaves him insufficiently developed and believable.<ref>Bear; Crecente.</ref> Similarly, some critics see the Chief as a [[stock character|stock]] action hero, with little added dimension.<ref>Team Freemont.</ref>
