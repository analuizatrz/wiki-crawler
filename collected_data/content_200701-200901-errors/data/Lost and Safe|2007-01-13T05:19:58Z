'''''Lost and Safe''''' is a 2005 album by [[The Books]].  It is in the same [[aleatoric]] style of their previous albums and continues their rich use of samples as diverse as [[Raymond Baxter]] ("That's the picture. You s-you see it for yourself."), [[W. H. Auden]] ("This great society is going smash / A culture is no better than its woods", from his poem "Bucolics: II, Woods"), and a reading of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s poem "[[Jabberwocky]]". Some of the sampled passages are either accompanied or performed elsewhere by guitarist/bassist Nick Zammuto in [[Sprechstimme]]. Some of the electicism of the samples is owed to their origins in [[Salvation Army]] shops.[http://www.dallasobserver.com/Issues/2006-04-06/music/music.html]
