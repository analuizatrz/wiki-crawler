{{nihongo|'''Namco Ltd'''|株式会社ナムコ|Kabushiki Gaisha Namuko}} is a amusement company based in [[Japan]], best known overseas for [[video games]] development. 

As of [[September 29]], [[2005]], Namco was officially merged by a leading Japanese toymaker [[Bandai]] to form [[Namco Bandai|Namco Bandai Holdings Inc (NBHD)]], one of the largest entertainment companies in Japan. Namco became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the holding company. Although officially the merger was absorption, it is agreed that both Namco and Bandai had equal power in group decision and each company's autonomy and cultures were respected, while [[synergy]] is encouraged.   

Under the holding company, on [[March 31]], [[2006]], Namco merged with [[Bandai]]'s video game operations and was renamed [[Namco Bandai Games|Namco Bandai Games Inc. (NBGI)]], which is also the head of NBHD's Game Contents [[strategic business unit|Strategic Business Unit]] (SBU). 

Namco Ltd.'s arcade venue, theme park and exploratory businesses as well as the Namco Ltd. corporate name and logo were span-out to a newly created sister company. (Namco 2: see below). It is the head of NBHD's Amusement SBU.

Some of the company's most famous games include ''[[Galaxian]]'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Klonoa]]'', ''[[Rally-X]]'', ''[[Galaga]]'', ''[[Bosconian]]'', ''[[Dig Dug]]'', ''[[Pole Position]]'', ''[[Xevious]]'', ''[[Mappy]]'', ''[[Soul series]]'', ''[[Time Crisis]]'', ''[[Tekken (series)|Tekken]]'', ''[[Xenosaga]]'', ''[[Ace Combat]]'', and ''[[Ridge Racer (series)|Ridge Racer]]''.    

== History of Namco (Namco 1: now Namco Bandai Games)==
''This section mainly describes the history of the Namco Ltd. which was renamed Namco Bandai Games Inc. on March 31, 2006. See [[Namco Bandai Games]] for the history after renaming.'' 

Namco was founded in [[Tokyo]] in [[1955]], by Masaya Nakamura under the name Nakamura Manufacturing Ltd. It began by producing mechanical rocking-horses and similar children's rides, which were installed in a number of department stores in [[Yokohama]] and [[Nihonbashi]]. It continued this line of production through the 1960s, and expanded with the addition of rides modeled after [[Walt Disney]] characters in [[1966]].

After the company's brand name was changed to Namco in [[1971]], it acquired the Japanese division of [[Atari]] in [[1974]], thus bringing Namco into the [[coin-op]]erated video game market. Namco Enterprises Asia Ltd. was established in [[Hong Kong]] and was soon followed by Namco America, Inc., based in [[California]]. In [[1978]], Namco released its first arcade video game ''[[Gee Bee (arcade game)|Gee Bee]]'' which was designed by [[Toru Iwatani]]. He also designed two sequels, ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' and ''[[Cutie Q]]'', which were released in 1979. The year [[1980]], saw the introduction of the company's most famous coin-operated arcade game, [[Pac-Man]], which was also developed by Iwatani. The main character, Pac-Man, has now been made the company's official mascot. When [[Nintendo]] began producing its [[Nintendo Famicom|Famicom]] home console unit, Namco started the development of game titles for it, beginning with ''[[Galaxian]]'', which had first been introduced to arcades in [[1979]]. Video games  for this [[video game console|console]] were released in Japan under the moniker Namcot (with the letter [[t]] at the end).

Namco was the industry's first manufacturer to develop and release a multi-player, multi-cabinet competitive game, ''[[Final Lap]]'', in [[1987]]. This game allowed up to 8 players to compete when four 2-player cabinets were linked in a simple network.  By [[1988]], the company's capital exceeded 5,500 million [[Yen]]. In [[1989]], another racing simulation game, ''[[Winning Run]]'', was released; that same year, the company's expertise with driving simulation matured with the development of the Eunos Roadster Driving Simulator, a joint venture with the [[Mazda]] Motor Corporation, followed by an educational program for traffic safety developed with [[Mitsubishi]]. On the other hand in the vision of barrier-free amusement Namco started up business for the eldery and the disabled with "Talking Aid" in [[1985]] .   

In the 1990s, Namco began directly selling coin-operated arcade games in the [[United States]] through subsidiary Namco America. Sennichimae Plabo was opened in [[Osaka]], featuring a new concept of large-scale arcade amusement, and Namco Wonder Eggs, a theme park, was opened in Tokyo. Additional amusement parks were opened, including Namco Wonder Park Sagamihara and Namco Wonder City.

In [[1993]], Namco merged its US arcade operation, Namco Operations, Inc., with the newly acquired Aladdin's Castle, Inc. to form [[Namco Cybertainment, Inc.|Namco Cybertainment, Incorporated]], bringing the company to the forefront as the largest arcade company in the world. In subsequent years, Namco Cybertainment, Inc. (NCI) purchased several other arcade operators, further strengthening the company's overall arcade operation. NCI now operates arcades under the names Time Out, CyberStation, Aladdin's Castle, Diamond Jim's, Space Port, and Pocket Change.  Throughout the 2000s Namco Cybertainment has continued to grow.  They are the only operator of national scope.  They manage over 1,000 locations in forty-eight  [[U.S. state|states]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Virgin Islands]].  On any given day, customers play games over three-quarters of a million times in locations they manage. They have nearly 30,000 games in their inventory, far surpassing any other operator.  If the games were stood end to end, they would stretch nearly 40 miles.  Namco Cybertainment owns the largest number of the most popular manufactured games in North America, including [[Sega]], [[Midway Games|Midway]], [[Konami]], ICE, and NAMCO AMERICA.  They are generally a coin-op manufacturer's largest customer.

Also in [[1993]], ''[[Ridge Racer]]'', a driving simulation game, entered arcades, featuring [[3D computer graphics]]; the game was later released for the [[Sony PlayStation]]. Another of the company's most famous games, ''[[Tekken]]'', was released in [[1994]], which was also soon ported to the PlayStation. In [[1995]] the game ''[[Soul Edge]]'' (''[[Soul Blade]]'' in the [[PAL region]]) was released. This was the second game to feature weapons in a three-dimensional fighting environment on a console system (''[[Battle Arena Toshinden]]'' was the first). With its ''Tekken'' and ''Soul'' franchises, Namco has been dominating the 3D [[fighting game]] market. They also released ''[[Cyber Sled]]'', a futuristic 3-D battle tank game, which was also ported to PlayStation.  Some [[light gun]] games were also released such as [[Point Blank (arcade game)|Point Blank]] and [[Time Crisis]].

In [[1996]] it acquired the controlling share of an almost bankrupt Japanese [[film|movie]] company [[Nikkatsu]]. 

On September 7 2005, it span-out Nikkatsu to [[Index Holding]].

In September [[2005]], Namco merged with [[Bandai]] to become "Namco Bandai Holdings", the 3rd largest video game entity in [[Japan]]. As such, Namco is now a part of the Namco Bandai Group.

In January [[2006]], a Namco Bandai subsidiary was established in the U.S. to handle mobile games in North America, called Namco Networks America Inc.  Working with the new 'next-gen' platform, Namco is able to port many of their time-tested arcade games to cell phones.  

In March 2006, Namco Networks also opened an e-commerce operation, www.clubNAMCO.com offering official merchandise based on Namco games. 

Under the parent Namco Bandai Holdings (NBHD), it absorbed [[Bandai]]'s video game operations and was renamed "Namco Bandai Games Inc." on March 31, [[2006]]. See [[Namco Bandai Games]] for the further development. 

Other businesses (theme parks and exploratory) were transferred to a new NBHD subsidiary which was also transferred its old corporate name of "Namco Ltd." as well. See the "Namco 2" section below for the subsidiary.

==History of Namco Ltd. (Namco 2: amusement facility developer and operator)==
On March 31, 2006, Namco Ltd.'s amusement venue and incubation businesses including rehabilitainment (coined from [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] and entertainment) were transferred to the newly created NBHD subsidiary which inherited the Namco Ltd. corporate name. 

It is the head of NBHD's Amusement SBU. Namco Ltd. itself operates within Japan and delegates overseas operations for the regional / field based sister companies in the Amusemet SBU. 

Currently Namco's operations includes: 
===Amusement===

*Internet shop.

</ul>

==Trivia==
Namco is represented by the number "765" and this number or a variation like "7650" appears in several of their games. "7" in Japanese is "nana" shortened to "na"; "6" in Japanese is muttsu, shortened to "m"; "5" in Japanese is "go", changed to voiceless form "co". "765" = "na-m-co" or "na-mu-co" for Japanese pronunciation.
