The '''National Soccer League''', or NSL, was the former national [[association football (soccer)]] competition in [[Australia]], overseen by [[Soccer Australia]] and later the [[Australian Soccer Association]]. The NSL spanned 28 seasons from its inception in 1977, until its demise in 2004. In 2005, it was succeeded by the [[A-League]] competition, run by [[Football Federation Australia]], the successor to the [[Australian Soccer Association]]. The competition was also known by various names including the '''[[Philips]] Soccer League''', '''[[Coca-Cola]] Soccer League''', '''[[Ericsson]] Cup''' and briefly during the mid-1990s the '''[[A-League]]'''.

==History==
===Pre-NSL history of interstate club competition===

Competition between club sides from different states existed in various forms prior to the formation of the NSL. The petroleum company [[Ampol]] sponsored cup competitions in the various states, starting with [[New South Wales]] in 1957, with other states following in their stead. Later a national [[Ampol]] Cup was conducted which continued throughout the 1960s. From 1962 until 1968 an [[Australian Cup (football)|Australia Cup]] was held, but its ambition of becoming an [[FA Cup]] style knockout competition went unfulfilled. In the 1970s the top sides from [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] played off in an end of season series, but the tournament didn't seem to quite capture the legitimacy and popularity that was hoped for. 

Plans for a national home and away league went back as far as 1965 for a 1967 start<ref>Hay, 2006, The World Game Downunder, pp 199</ref>, and were followed up by variations on the theme throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, but faced opposition variously from clubs, who deemed the notion uneconomical, and state federations who feared losing their power. [[Australia]]'s qualification for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] led to various discussions in 1975 and 1976, with eventually 14 teams being chosen to participate in the inaugural season of the national league<ref>Hay, 2006, The World Game Downunder, pp 120</ref>. 

The transition from state-based leagues to a national competition was not all smooth. The [[Football Federation Victoria|Victorian Soccer Federation]] was reluctant for its big clubs to be involved and it appeared the dream of Alex Pongrass of [[St George Saints|St George]] and [[Frank Lowy]] of [[Sydney City Soccer Club|Hakoah Sydney]] for a nationwide club competition would not evolve. Little-known [[Mooroolbark FC|Mooroolbark]] from [[Melbourne]]'s outer eastern suburbs broke the deadlock by joining the competition, bringing three other [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] sides with it, making the national league a reality.<ref>Hay, 2006, The World Game Downunder, pp 121-122</ref>

===1977-1983 Sydney dominance===
The first seven seasons of the league would be dominated by [[Sydney]] clubs, with [[Sydney City Soccer Club|Sydney City]] winning four titles, and only [[West Adelaide SC]] being able to wrest the title from [[New South Wales]]. The competition at this stage was a simple first past the post. A post season finals series was played during this era but was considered more of an exhibition series rather than a legitimate game to decide the national champion, although some confusion still exists on this matter particularly amongst some [[Heidelberg United|Heidelberg]] supporters who consider the 1980 'final' as a legitimate decider.<ref>[http://www.heidelbergunitedsc.com.au/history.htm Heidelberg United SC - History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===1984-1986 Conference system and shift of power===
Falling crowds led to the radical move of introducing more teams (mainly from Victoria and [[New South Wales]]) and splitting the league into two conferences, with the winner of each division to play off in an end of year two legged final. For season 1984 this comprised of the '[[Australia]]n' Conference with competing teams from [[New South Wales]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], whilst the 'National' Conference consisted of Victorian, [[South Australia]]n and [[Queensland]] clubs. For 1985 and 1986 this reverted to 'Northern' and 'Southern' Conferences. Strangely, the competition's most geographically northern sides, [[Queensland Lions Soccer Club|Brisbane Lions]] and [[Brisbane City Soccer Club|Brisbane City]] were in the latter grouping.

This period saw [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] become the first [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n team to win the league, followed by [[Brunswick Juventus]], and [[Adelaide City]], all Southern conference sides. At the end of the 1986 season, the system was scrapped, and about half the teams were dumped back to their respective state leagues. The criteria used to decide who stayed and who went was based 50% on the 1986 playing record, 40% on past playing record, and 10% on crowd support.<ref>Thompson, 2006, One Fantastic Goal, pp 263</ref>. The result was that only one team from outside [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], reigning champions [[Adelaide City]], was retained.

===1987-1989 Return to single division and last years of winter football===
The revamped league suffered a major setback early on when [[Sydney City]] pulled out of the competition after just one round into the new season<ref>Thompson, 2006, One Fantastic Goal, pp 263</ref>. Apart from returning to a single division, the league also dispensed with finals for the 1987 season, reverting back to first past the post. Many considered this an ill-considered move, as it robbed the league of its most high profile games.<ref>Thompson, 2006, One Fantastic Goal, pp 263-264</ref>. Finals were re-introduced from 1988, and were to remain until the league's demise. The 1989 season would be the last to be played in winter. This period saw a re-emergence of [[New South Wales]] dominance with all titles, minor premierships and runners-up being from that state.

===1989/90-1995/96 Birth of summer football===
Attempts to shift the league towards a [[summer]] season went back into the early 1980s, but only came to pass for the 1989/90 season. The rationale for this change was simple. The league would avoid being marginalised in the media during the peak of the [[Australian Football League]] and [[Australian Rugby League]] seasons, as well as providing better playing surfaces and spectator comfort owing to the better weather. 

The impetus given to the league from the switch was not enough for some clubs to remain in the league, with many clubs being relegated or being demoted back to the state leagues, including former champions [[Brunswick Juventus]], [[St George Saints|St George]] and [[A.P.I.A. Leichhardt Tigers|APIA Leichhardt]], as well as once upon a time contenders in [[Heidelberg United|Heidelberg]] and [[Preston Lions FC|Preston]]. This coincided with a renewed push by [[soccer]] authorities to force clubs to market themselves to mainstream [[Australia]], as opposed to their own mostly [[migrant]] fan bases. This included name and logo changes, as well as the banning of ethnic flags, changes which were begrudgingly agreed to by the clubs, though in the terraces the fans generally continued to chant the old names. [[Marconi Stallions|Marconi]], [[South Melbourne FC]], Adelaide City and the [[Melbourne Knights]] were the dominant sides of this era, with
numerous titles and grand final appearances between them.

===1996/97-2000/01 New clubs and attempts to enter the mainstream===
From 1996 onwards the league attempted to revitalise the competition and attempt to hook into the mainstream support by finally introducing a team from [[Western Australia]], in the form of [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]], as well as other new entities which promised to deliver mainstream support, as well as being fully professional outfits as opposed to the majority of clubs and players who were only semi-professional. Among the new clubs at this time were the [[Collingwood Warriors S.C.|Collingwood Warriors]], [[Carlton S.C.|Carlton]], [[Northern Spirit FC|Northern Spirit]] and [[Parramatta Power]]. 

These clubs would have varying degrees of success on and off the field. [[Collingwood Warriors]] barely managed to last a season, while [[Carlton S.C.|Carlton]] reached the grand final in its debut year, but was unable to attract a substantial fan base. [[Northern Spirit]] started off with record crowds, and a good debut season reaching the finals, but gradually crowds declined, and financial difficulties along with a controversial takeover by [[Rangers FC|Rangers]], didn't help matters. They would survive until the end of the NSL, but fold thereafter. [[Parramatta Power]] failed to gather much support, placed as it was in the midst of the already crowded western [[Sydney]] [[soccer]] market, and it too would not last beyond the end of the NSL. [[Perth Glory]] became the most successful of the new mainstream entrants. High crowds and good performances throughout the NSL's last decade contributed to make the [[Perth Glory]] for many observers the benchmark and role model for all future entrants to the [[Australia]]n top-flight.

A record grand final crowd of 40,000 people saw the [[Brisbane Strikers]] become the first [[Queensland]] side to win the title in season 1996/97, but it never resulted in [[Brisbane]] gaining much bigger crowds in the following seasons than they were accustomed to. [[South Melbourne FC]] won back to back titles in the late 1990s, and by also winning the [[Oceania Club Championship 1999|1999 Oceania Club Championship]], earning the right to play in the [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship]], where it put in some respectable performances, and a tidy sum in prize money. [[Wollongong Wolves]] became the only side from regional [[Australia]] to win the league, with their back to back titles in 1999/2000 and 2000/01. The cancellation of the [[2001 FIFA Club World Championship]] however was a major blow to the league, as clubs which had seen a way of making a substantial amount of much needed cash, now had to resort the old practice of selling players overseas to make ends meet.

===2001/02-2003/04 Decline and demise===
With the exodus of [[Australia]]n players to overseas leagues continuing, a disastrous [[television]] deal with the [[Seven Network]] seeing next to zero coverage of the league on [[television]], and with the consequent lack of sponsorship, the league fell into even further decline leading to its eventual demise. [[Sydney Olympic FC|Sydney Olympic]] re-emerged as a genuine leading club for the first time in a decade, winning its second title, and [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]] went on to win the last two titles of the NSL, after previously having lost two grand finals. The birth of [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]], as a quickly formed replacement of [[Adelaide City]] who withdrew just before the start of the final NSL season, was perhaps the sole highlight of this era, as they put in good performances, but most importantly, registered crowds which had not been seen in [[Adelaide]] since the heyday of [[Adelaide City]] and [[West Adelaide SC|West Adelaide]]. With the league's demise, national competition went into recess until the [[A-League]] began in the second half of 2005, with five NSL clubs taking part, those being [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]], [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]], [[New Zealand Knights FC|New Zealand Knights]] (who had played in the NSL primarily under the name Football Kingz), [[Newcastle United Jets]] and [[Queensland Roar FC|Queensland Roar]] who had participated in the NSL under the name [[Queensland Lions Soccer Club|Brisbane Lions]].

==Competition format==
The competition structure changed many times throughout the NSL's history. From its inception in 1977 until 1983, it was simply a matter of first past the post. However a compromise format was devised between the traditional [[Europe]]an first past the post and the [[Australia]]n system of finals. In 1978, 1979 (two-legged Grand Final), 1980 and 1982 a finals series was conducted but the winner of the Grand Final didn't determine who won the title. From 1984 until 1986, the league introduced more teams split into two conferences (1984 - Australian Conference, [[NSW]]/[[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] clubs and National Conference, [[VIC]], [[SA]], [[QLD]]; 1985 and 1986 - Northern Conference, [[NSW]]/[[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] clubs and Southern Conference for the rest) with 12 teams in each. The top five in each division would qualify for the playoffs, with the winner of each of the divisional playoffs playing off in a two-legged Grand Final. In 1987, the league dumped 11 teams, scrapped the split divisions, and the championship system reverted to first past the post.

In 1988 the league re-introduced a finals system, with the top five sides qualifying for the playoffs. In season 1992/93, the league increased the finalists to six. This system was used for the rest of the league's duration, except for season 2002/03 when the top six sides played a further series of home and away games against each other, with the top two playing off in the Grand Final.

The NSL also used a variety of point systems throughout its history. From 1977 until season 1991/92, teams were awarded two points for a win, one point for draw, and none for a loss. The exceptions to this were 1979, in which wins by four goals or more were awarded a bonus point, and 1983, in which three points were awarded for a win. From season 1992/93 onwards three points were awarded for a win, except for season 1994/95. In that season, four points were awarded for a win, with games ending in draws, being decided by penalty shootouts at the end of the game. The winner of the shootout received two points, the loser one point.
