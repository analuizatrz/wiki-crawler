-->The '''North Atlantic Treaty Organis<!--don't change this s to a z! see endnote-->ation'''<ref>NATO uses [[British English]] spelling. This convention is discussed in its [http://www.nato.int/issues/faq/index.html#C4 online frequently asked questions]: ''"Q: Why do you spell 'organisation' with an 's' and not a 'z'? A: By tradition, NATO uses European English spellings in all public information documents..."''.</ref> ('''NATO'''; {{lang-fr|l'Organisation du Traité de l'Atlantique Nord}}; also called the ''North Atlantic Alliance'', the ''Atlantic Alliance'' or the ''Western Alliance'') is a [[military alliance]] established on [[4 April]] [[1949]] by the signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]]. Headquartered in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]],<ref>Boulevard LéopoIII, B-1110 BRUSSELS, which is in Haren, part of the [[City of Brussels]]. {{citeweb|url=http://www.nato.int/|title=NATO homepage|accessdate=2006-03-07}}</ref> the organis<!--don't change this s to a z! see endnote-->ation establishes a system of [[collective security]], whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party.

==Purpose==
The core purpose of NATO is established in Article V of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], which outlines the system of [[collective security]]:
{{cquote|The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all. Consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.}}

Article V was invoked for the first and only time in the treaty's history on [[12 September]] [[2001]], in response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] that occurred in the [[United States]] the previous day.<ref>[http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2001/p01-124e.htm Statement by the North Atlantic Council]</ref>

==History==
=== Beginnings ===
[[Image:NATO vs Warsaw (1949-1990).png|300px|thumb|Borders of NATO (blue) and [[Warsaw Pact]] (red) states]]
The [[Treaty of Brussels 1948|Treaty of Brussels]], signed on [[17 March]] [[1948]] by [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]], is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement. This treaty established a military alliance, later to become the [[Western European Union]]. However, [[United States|American]] participation was thought necessary in order to counter the military power of the [[Soviet Union]], and therefore talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately.

These talks resulted in the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], created by [[Lester B. Pearson]], which was signed in [[Washington, DC]] on [[4 April]] [[1949]]. It included the five Treaty of [[Brussels]] states, as well as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]]. Three years later, on [[18 February]] [[1952]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] also joined. Because of geography, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] missed out on membership. In place of this, the [[ANZUS]] agreement was made by the [[United States]] with these nations.

In 1954 the [[Soviet Union]] suggested that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe. The NATO countries rejected this, seeing it as an attempt to subvert NATO from within.

The incorporation of [[West Germany]] into the organisation on [[9 May]] [[1955]] was described as "a decisive turning point in the history of our continent" by [[Halvard Lange]], Foreign Minister of Norway at the time.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/9/newsid_2519000/2519979.stm</ref> Indeed, one of its immediate results was the creation of the [[Warsaw Pact]], signed on [[14 May]] [[1955]] by the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[satellite state]]s as a formal response to this event, firmly establishing the two opposing sides of the [[Cold War]].

=== Early Cold War===
{{see|Cold War}}
The unity of NATO was breached early on in its history, with a crisis occurring during [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency of France from 1958 onward.  De Gaulle protested the United States' hegemonical role in the organisation and protested what he perceived as a [[special relationship]] between the United States and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum he sent on [[17 September]] [[1958]] to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]], he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom, and also for the expansion of NATO's coverage to include geographical areas of interest to France.

Considering the response he was given to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle started pursuing an independent defence for his country. France withdrew its Mediterranean fleet from NATO command on [[March 11]] [[1959]], and pursued an independent nuclear programme. In June 1959, de Gaulle banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil, which caused the United States to transfer 200 military aircraft out of France; on [[February 13]], [[1960]], France tested its first nuclear bomb.

Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the [[Cuban missile crisis]] in 1962, de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by also removing the Atlantic and Channel fleets of France from NATO command. In 1966 all French armed forces were removed from NATO’s integrated military command and all non-French NATO troops were asked to leave France. This precipitated the relocation of the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) from [[Paris]] to [[Brussels]], Belgium, by [[16 October]] [[1967]]. In Belgium, NATO also is based in Casteau in South Brussels. France rejoined NATO's military command in 1993.

=== Détente ===
{{see|Détente}}
During most of the duration of the [[Cold War]], NATO maintained a holding pattern with no actual military engagement as an organisation. On [[1 July]] [[1968]], the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] opened for signature: NATO argued that its [[nuclear weapons sharing]] arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until a decision was made to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged.

On [[30 May]] [[1978]], NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue [[détente]]. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the [[Warsaw Pact]]'s offensive capabilities without spurring a further [[arms race]].

However, on [[12 December]] [[1979]], in light of a build-up of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US [[Cruise missile|Cruise]] and [[Pershing II]] theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position in regard to nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the [[Dual-Track Decision|Dual Track]] policy. Similarly, in 1983&ndash;84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact [[SS-20]] medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles able to reach Moscow within minutes. This action led to [[peace movement]] protests throughout Western Europe.

The membership of the organisation in this time period likewise remained largely static, with NATO only gaining one new member in [[30 May]] [[1982]], when newly democratic Spain joined the alliance, following a [[referendum]]. Greece also in 1974 withdrew its forces from NATO’s military command structure, as a result of Greco-Turkish tensions following the 1974 Cyprus dispute; Greek forces were however readmitted in 1980, with Turkish cooperation.

In November 1983, a NATO manoeuvre code-named [[Able Archer 83]], which simulated a NATO nuclear release, caused panic in the Kremlin. Soviet leadership, led by ailing General Secretary [[Yuri Andropov]] became concerned that US President [[Ronald Reagan]] may have been intending to launch a genuine [[first strike]].  In response, Soviet nuclear forces were readied and air units in Eastern Germany and Poland were placed on alert.  Though at the time written off by US intelligence as a propaganda effort, many historians now believe Soviet fear of a NATO first strike was genuine.

===Cold War stay behind armies===
{{main|Operation Gladio |Stay-behind}}
NATO was founded early in the Cold War with the express aim of defending western Europe against a military invasion by the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1990 it was discovered<ref name="Ganser">''NATO's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe'', by Daniele Ganser, Franck Cass, London, 2005 ISBN 0-7146-5607-0. See also [http://globalresearch.ca/articles/GAN412A.html NATO’s secret armies linked to terrorism?], by Daniele Ganser, December 17, 2004 &mdash; URL accessed on January 18, 2007 </ref> that some NATO states had set up and organised clandestine [[paramilitary]] [[militia]]s, known as "[[stay-behind]] armies", who would use guerrilla tactics behind enemy lines following a successful invasion. These paramilitary groups, also known as [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]], are accused of having carried out dozens of terrorist bombings, notably in Italy during the [[strategy of tension]] years, which were officially blamed on leftist groups such as the [[Red Brigades]].
On [[24 October]] [[1990]] Italian Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] told the [[Italian Parliament]] that NATO had long held a covert policy of training partisans in the event of a Soviet Invasion of Western Europe.<ref name = "ed"> {{cite journal| first =Ed | last =Vulliamy| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =1990| month =5 December | title =Secret agents, freemasons, fascists... and a top-level campaign of political 'destabilisation'| journal =[[The Guardian]]| volume =| issue =| pages =12| id =| url =http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/vinciguerra.p2.etc_graun_5dec1990.html }}</ref><ref name = "felix"> {{cite journal| first =Felix | last =Würsten| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2005| month =October 2 | title =Conference "Nato Secret Armies and P26": The dark side of the West| journal =ETH Life Magazine | volume =| issue =| pages =| id =| url =http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/e/articles/sciencelife/NatoGeheimarmee.html }}</ref><ref name = "gladio"> {{cite journal| first =Charles | last =Richards| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =1990 | month =1 December|title =Gladio is still opening wounds| journal =The Independent| volume =| issue =| pages =12| id =| url = http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/gladio.parliamentary.committee_indep_1dec1990.html}}</ref> Spurred by the difficulties in setting up partisan organisation in occupied Europe during the [[World War II|Second World War]], the CIA, British [[MI6]] and NATO trained and armed partisan groups in NATO states to fight a guerrilla war if they were conquered in the event of a [[Warsaw Pact]] Invasion. 

It has been alleged that these groups and the individuals in them were responsible for the [[strategy of tension]] in Italy which aimed at impeding the "[[historic compromise]]" between the Christian Democracy and the Italian Communist Party (PCI) (including the 1969 [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] and the [[Bologna massacre|Bologna massacre (1980)]])<ref name = "translate"> {{cite web| title =Translated from Bologna massacre Association of Victims Italian website| work =Google.com| url =http://translate.google.com/translate?sourceid=navclient-menuext&hl=en&u=http://www.stragi.it/index.php?pagina=vicenda | accessdate=2006-07-30}}{{it icon}} </ref><ref name = "mt"> {{cite journal| first =Chris | last =Floyd| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2005| month =February 18|title =Global Eye - Sword Play| journal =[[The Moscow Times]]| volume =| issue =| pages =| id =| url =http://context.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2005/02/18/120.html }}</ref><ref name="Ganser"/> political [[Belgian stay-behind network|assassinations in Belgium]],<ref> Hans Depraetere and Jenny Dierickx, ''"La Guerre froide en Belgique"'' ("Cold War in Belgium") (EPO-Dossier, Anvers, 1986) {{fr icon}} </ref> military coups in [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Greece (1967)]] and [[Military coup in Turkey, 1980|Turkey (1980)]]<ref name="Our boys"> Selahattin Celik, ''Türkische Konterguerilla.

=== Post-Cold War ===

The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1991 removed the ''de facto'' main adversary of NATO. This caused a strategic re-evalution of NATO's purpose, nature and tasks. In practice this ended up entailing a gradual (and still ongoing) expansion of NATO to Eastern Europe, as well as the extension of its activities to areas that had not formerly been NATO concerns.
The first post-Cold War expansion of NATO came with the [[reunification of Germany]] on [[3 October]] [[1990]], when the former [[East Germany]] became part of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and the alliance. This had been agreed in the [[Two Plus Four Treaty]] earlier in the year. To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east, and also that NATO would never expand further east.<ref>Gorbachev's Lost Legacy by Stephen F. Cohen [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050314/cohen (link)] [[The Nation]], February 24, 2005</ref>

On [[28 February]] [[1994]], NATO also took its first military action, shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating a UN-mandated [[no-fly zone]] over central [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Operation Deny Flight, the no-fly-zone enforcement mission, had began a year before, on [[12 April]] [[1993]], and was to continue until [[20 December]] [[1995]]. NATO air strikes that year helped bring the [[Yugoslav wars|war in Bosnia]] to an end, resulting in the [[Dayton Agreement]].

Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbours were set up, like the [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] initiative and the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]]. On [[8 July]] [[1997]], three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO, which finally happened in 1999.

On [[24 March]] [[1999]], NATO saw its first broad-scale military engagement in the [[Kosovo War]], where it waged an [[Operation Allied Force|11-week bombing campaign]] against what was then the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. A formal declaration of war never took place. Yugoslavia referred to the Kosovo War as ''military aggression'', as being undeclared and contravening the UN Charter.<ref>In regards to the definition of ''aggression'' reached by consensus and approved by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on [[14 December]] [[1974]] as Resolution 3314 (XXIX): ''"Aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the UN."''</ref> The conflict ended on [[11 June]] [[1999]], when Yugoslavian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] agreed to NATO’s demands by accepting [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN resolution 1244]]. NATO then helped establish the [[KFOR]], a NATO-led force under a [[United Nations]] mandate that operated the military mission in Kosovo.

Debate concerning NATO's role and the concerns of the wider international community continued throughout its expanded military activities: The United States opposed efforts to require the UN Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the ongoing action against Yugoslavia, while France and other NATO countries claimed the alliance needed UN approval. American officials said that this would undermine the authority of the alliance, and they noted that [[Russia]] and [[China]] would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on [[Yugoslavia]]. In April 1999, at the Washington summit, a German proposal that NATO adopt a [[no-first-use]] [[nuclear strategy]] was rejected.

=== After the September 11 attacks ===

The expansion of the activities and geographical reach of NATO grew even further as an outcome of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th attacks]]. These caused as a response the provisional invocation (on [[September 12]]) of the collective security of NATO's charter &mdash; Article 5 which states that any attack on a member state will be considered an attack against the entire group of members. The invocation was confirmed on [[4 October]] [[2001]] when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty.<ref>http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm</ref> The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included the first two examples of military action taken in response to an invocation of Article 5: [[Operation Eagle Assist]] and [[Operation Active Endeavour]].

Despite this early show of solidarity, NATO faced a crisis little more than a year later, when on [[10 February]] [[2003]], France and Belgium vetoed the procedure of silent approval concerning the timing of protective measures for Turkey in case of a possible war with [[Iraq]]. Germany did not use its right to break the procedure but said it supported the veto.

On the issue of [[Afghanistan]] on the other hand, the alliance showed greater unity: On [[16 April]] [[2003]] NATO agreed to take command of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands, the two nations leading ISAF at the time of the agreement, and all 19 NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on [[11 August]], and marked the first time in NATO’s history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area. [[Canada]] had originally been slated to take over ISAF by itself on that date.

In January 2004, NATO appointed Minister [[Hikmet Çetin]], of Turkey, as the Senior Civilian Representative (SCR) in Afghanistan. Minister Cetin is primarily responsible for advancing the political-military aspects of the Alliance in Afghanistan.

On [[31 July]] [[2006]], a NATO-led force, made up mostly of troops from Canada, Great Britain, Turkey and the Netherlands, took over military operations in the south of Afghanistan from a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition.

===Expansion and restructuring=== 
[[Image:NATO March 29 2004.jpg|250px|thumb|The U.S. President [[George Walker Bush]], NATO Secretary General, and the Prime Ministers of Latvia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Estonia after a South Lawn ceremony welcoming them into NATO on [[29 March]] [[2004]].]]
New NATO structures were also formed while old ones were abolished: The [[NATO Response Force]] (NRF) was launched at the [[2002 Prague Summit of NATO|2002 Prague Summit]] on [[21 November]].  On [[19 June]] [[2003]], a major restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic were abolished and a new command, [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT), was established in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[USA]], and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) became the Headquarters of [[Allied Command Operations]] (ACO).  ACT is responsible for driving transformation (future capabilities) in NATO, whilst ACO is responsible for current operations.

Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Northern European and Eastern European countries to NATO: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] (see [[Baltic Air Policing]]) and also [[Slovenia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Romania]]. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague Summit, and joined NATO on [[29 March]] [[2004]]. 

A number of other countries have also expressed a wish to join the alliance, including [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]],  [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Croatia]]. 

From the Russian point of view, NATO's eastward expansion since the end of the cold war has been in clear breach of an agreement between Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and US President [[George H.W. Bush]] which allowed for a peaceful [[German reunification|unification of Germany]]. NATO's expansion policy is seen as a continuation of a Cold War attempt to surround and isolate Russia.<ref>NATO Seeking to Weaken CIS by Expansion — Russian General [http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/12/01/balusaid.shtml (link)] MosNews 01.12.2005</ref><ref>Ukraine moves closer to NATO membership By Taras Kuzio [http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=407&issue_id=3316&article_id=2369682 (Link)] Jamestown Foundation</ref><ref>Global Realignment [http://www.lrna.org/doc.4/globalre.html]</ref><ref>Condoleezza Rice wants Russia to acknowledge USA's interests on post-Soviet space [http://english.pravda.ru/world/americas/04-05-2006/79870-rice-0 (Link)] Pravda 04.05.2006</ref>

==Future membership==
As a procedure for nations wishing to join NATO, a mechanism called [[Membership Action Plan]] (MAP) was approved in the Washington Summit of 1999. A country's participation in MAP entails the annual presentation of reports concerning its progress on five different measures:
*Willingness to settle international, ethnic or external territorial disputes by peaceful means, commitment to the rule of law and human rights, and democratic control of armed forces
*Ability to contribute to the organisation's defence and missions 
*Devotion of sufficient resources to armed forces to be able to meet the commitments of membership
*Security of sensitive information, and safeguards ensuring it
*Compatibility of domestic legislation with NATO cooperation

NATO provides feedback as well as technical advice to each country and evaluates its progress on an individual basis.<ref>http://www.nato.int/issues/map/index.html</ref>

NATO is also unlikely to invite countries such as the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], where popular opinion and the elected governments do not support NATO membership. NATO recognizes the [[policy of neutrality]] practised in these countries, and does not consider the failure to set a goal for NATO membership as a sign of distrust.

==== Ukraine ====
[[Ukraine]] Defence Minister [[Anatoliy Hrytsenko]] declared that Ukraine would have an Action Plan on NATO membership by the end of March 2006, to begin implementation by September 2006. A final decision concerning Ukraine's membership in NATO is expected to be made in 2008, with full membership possible by 2010.<ref>http://en.for-ua.com/news/2006/03/20/114232.html</ref>

The idea of Ukrainian membership in NATO has gained support from a number of NATO leaders, including President [[Traian Băsescu]] of [[Romania]]<ref>http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/bulgarias-capital-to-host-nato-talks/id_14114/catid_66</ref> and president [[Ivan Gašparovič]] of Slovakia.<ref>http://www.slovakspectator.sk/clanok.asp?cl=22855</ref> The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, [[Alexander Grushko]], announced however that NATO membership for Ukraine was not in Russia's best interests and wouldn't help the relations of the two countries.<ref>http://www.interfax.kiev.ua/eng/go.cgi?31,20060424001</ref>

Currently a majority of Ukrainian citizens oppose NATO membership. Protests have taken place by opposition blocs against the idea, and petitions signed urging the end of relations with NATO. Prime Minister [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]] has indicated Ukraine will not enter NATO as long as the public continues opposing the move.<ref>http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=4735634&PageNum=0</ref>
Plans for membership were shelved on [[14 September]] [[2006]] due to the overwhelming disapproval of NATO membership.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/14/ukraine.nato.reut/index.html?section=cnn_world</ref>

==== Finland ====
Finland is participating in nearly all sub-areas of the Partnership for Peace programme, and has provided peacekeeping forces to the Afghanistan and Kosovo missions. The possibility of [[Finland]]'s membership in NATO was one of the most major issues debated in relation to the [[Finnish presidential election, 2006|Finnish presidential election of 2006]]. 

The main contester of the presidency, [[Sauli Niinistö]] of the [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|National Coalition Party]], supported Finland joining a "more European" NATO. Fellow right-winger [[Henrik Lax]] of the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]] likewise supported the concept. On the other side, incumbent president [[Tarja Halonen]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] opposed changing the status quo, as did most other candidates in the election. Her victory and re-election to the post of president has currently put the issue of a NATO membership for Finland on hold for at least the duration of her term.

Other political figures of Finland who have weighed in with opinions include former [[President of Finland]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]] who has argued that Finland should join all the organisations supported by other Western democracies in order "to shrug off once and for all the burden of [[Finlandisation]]".<ref>[http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20031215IE6 Helsingin Sanomat: Former President Ahtisaari: NATO membership would put an end to Finlandisation murmurs]</ref> Another former president, [[Mauno Koivisto]], opposes the idea, arguing that NATO membership would ruin Finland's relations with Russia.<ref>[http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040120IE3 Helsingin Sanomat: Finland, NATO, and Russia]</ref>

Polls in Finland indicate that the public is strongly against NATO membership.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1101978684236 Helsingin Sanomat: Clear majority of Finns still opposed to NATO membership]</ref>

== Cooperation with non-member states==

[[Image:NATO Partners.png|240px|thumb|
{{legend|#181884|NATO member states}}
{{legend|#8c9618|Partnership for Peace countries}}
{{legend|#944918|Mediterranean Dialogue countries}}]]

===Euro-Atlantic Partnership===
{{main|Partnership for Peace|Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council}}

A double framework has been established to help further co-operation between the 26 NATO members and 23 "partner countries".

* The '''Partnership for Peace (PfP)''' programme was established in 1994 and is based on individual bilateral relations between each partner country and NATO: each country may choose the extent of its participation. The PfP programme is considered the operational wing of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership.<ref>http://www.nato.int/issues/pfp/index.html  http://www.nato.int/pfp/sig-date.html</ref>
* The '''Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC)''' on the other hand was first established on [[29 May]] [[1997]], and is a forum for regular coordination, consultation and dialogue between all 49 participants.<ref>http://www.nato.int/issues/eapc/index.html</ref>

The 23 partner countries are the following:

{|
|- valign=top
|
* [[Post-Soviet states|Former Soviet republics]]:
:# {{flagcountry2|Armenia}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Azerbaijan}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Belarus}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Georgia}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Kazakhstan}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Kyrgyzstan}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Moldova}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Russia}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Tajikistan}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Turkmenistan}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Ukraine}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Uzbekistan}}
|
* Countries that (though militarily neutral) possessed capitalist economies during the Cold War: 
:# {{flagcountry2|Austria}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Finland}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Republic of Ireland}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Sweden}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Switzerland}}

* Nations that (though militarily neutral) possessed socialist economies during the Cold War:
:# {{flagcountry2|Albania}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Croatia}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Montenegro}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Republic of Macedonia}}
:# {{flagcountry2|Serbia}}
|}

* {{flagcountry2|Malta}} joined [[Partnership for Peace|PfP]] in 1994, but its new government withdrew in 1996. Because of this Malta is not participating in [[European Security and Defence Policy|ESDP]] activities that use NATO assets and information.
* {{flagcountry2|Cyprus}}'s admission to [[Partnership for Peace|PfP]] is resisted by [[Turkey]], because of the [[Northern Cyprus]] issue. Because of this Cyprus is not participating in [[European Security and Defence Policy|ESDP]] activities that use NATO assets and information.

===Individual Partnership Action Plans===
Launched at the November 2002 Prague Summit, [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]]s (IPAPs) are open to countries that have the political will and ability to deepen their relationship with NATO.<ref>http://www.nato.int/issues/ipap/index.html</ref>

Currently '''IPAPs''' are in implementation with the following countries:

* {{flagcountry2|Azerbaijan}} ([[27 May]] [[2005]])
* {{flagcountry2|Armenia}} ([[16 December]] [[2005]])
* {{flagcountry2|Kazakhstan}} ([[31 January]] [[2006]])
* {{flagcountry2|Moldova}} ([[19 May]] [[2006]])

===Intensified Dialogue===
Intensified Dialogue with NATO is viewed as a stage before being invited to enter the alliance [[Membership Action Plan]] (MAP), while the latter should eventually lead to NATO membership.

Countries currently engaged in an [[Intensified Dialogue]] with NATO:

* {{flagcountry2|Ukraine}} ([[21 April]] [[2005]]) 
* {{flagcountry2|Georgia}} ([[21 September]] [[2006]])

===Mediterranean Dialogue===

The [[Mediterranean Dialogue]], first launched in 1994 is a forum of cooperation between NATO and seven countries of the Mediterranean:<ref>http://www.nato.int/med-dial/home.htm</ref>
* {{flagcountry2|Algeria}}
* {{flagcountry2|Egypt}}
* {{flagcountry2|Israel}}
* {{flagcountry2|Jordan}}
* {{flagcountry2|Mauritania}}
* {{flagcountry2|Morocco}}
* {{flagcountry2|Tunisia}}
On 16 October 2006, NATO and Israel finalised the first ever Individual Cooperation Programme (ICP) under the enhanced Mediterranean Dialogue, where Israel will be contributing to the NATO maritime Operation Active Endeavour<ref>http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2006/p06-123e.htm</ref>.  The ICP covers many areas of common interest, such as the fight against terrorism and joint military exercises in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

===NATO-Russian Federation Council===
{{main|NATO-Russia Council}}

NATO and Russian Federation made a reciprocal commitment in 1997 "to work together to build a stable, secure and undivided continent on the basis of partnership and common interest."

In May 2002, this commitment was strengthened with the establishment of the NATO-Russia Council, which brings together the NATO members and Russia. The purpose of this council is to identify and pursue opportunities for joint action with the 27 participants as equal partners.

===Other partners===
In April 2005, [[Australia]] signed a [[security]] agreement with NATO on enhancing intelligence co-operation in the fight against terrorism. Australia also posted a defence attache to NATO's headquarters.<ref>http://english.people.com.cn/200504/02/eng20050402_179138.html</ref> Cooperation with [[Japan]], [[El Salvador]], [[South Korea]] and [[New Zealand]] was also announced as priority.<ref>http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2006/s060427d.htm</ref>
[[Israel]] is currently a [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] country and has been recently seeking to expand its relationship with NATO. The first visit by a head of NATO to Israel occurred on [[23 February]] - [[24 February]] [[2005]]<ref>http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=2&article_id=12960</ref> and the first joint Israel-NATO naval exercise occurred on [[27 March]] [[2005]].<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/nato032705.html</ref> In May of the same year Israel was admitted to the [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]]. Israeli troops also took part in NATO exercises in June 2005. 

There have been advocates for the NATO membership of [[Israel]], amongst them the former Prime Minister of Spain [[José María Aznar]] and Italian Defence Minister [[Antonio Martino]]. However Secretary-General of the organisation [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] has dismissed such calls, saying that membership for Israel is not on the table. Martino himself said that a membership process could only come after an Israeli request; such a request has not taken place.<ref>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1525103&C=europe</ref>

Israeli Foreign Minister [[Silvan Shalom]] stated in February 2005 that his country was looking to upgrade its relationship with NATO from a dialogue to a partnership, but that it was not seeking membership, saying that "NATO members are committed to mutual defence and we don't think we are in a position where we can intervene in other struggles in the world", and also that "We don't see that NATO should get engaged in our conflict here in the Middle East."<ref>http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=2&article_id=12960</ref>

The issue of Israel's potential membership again came to the forefront in early 2006 after heightened tensions between [[Israel]] and [[Iran]]. Former Prime Minister of Spain [[José María Aznar]] argued that Israel should become a member of the organisation alongside [[Japan]] and [[Australia]], saying that "So far, expansion of NATO was an attempt at the growth and consolidation of democratic change in the former communist countries. Now it is time to do the opposite, to expand toward those democratic nations that are committed to the struggle against our common enemy and ready to contribute to the common effort to free ourselves from it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spainherald.com/2674.html|work=The Spain Herald|accessdate=2006-03-22|title=Aznar proposes NATO reform to Hoover Institute}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spainherald.com/2754.html|work=The Spain Herald|accessdate=2006-03-22|title=Aznar criticised the Iranian regime, called for a firm response from Europe}}</ref>

Aznar also proposed a strategic co-operation with [[India]] and [[Colombia]].

==Structures==
===Political structure===
[[Image:Bush_dehoopscheffer.jpg|thumb|[[Secretary General of NATO|Secretary General]] [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] meeting [[George Bush]] on [http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060320-1.html March 20, 2006] ]]
Like any alliance, NATO is ultimately governed by its 26 member states. However, the North Atlantic Treaty, and other agreements, outline how decisions are to be made within NATO. Each of the 26 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO’s headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. The senior permanent member of each delegation is known as the Permanent Representative and is generally a senior [[civil servant]] or an experienced [[ambassador]] (and holding that diplomatic rank).  

Together the Permanent Members form the [[North Atlantic Council]] (NAC), a body which meets together at least once a week and has effective political authority and powers of decision in NATO.  
From time to time the Council also meets at higher levels involving [[Foreign Minister]]s, [[Defence Minister]]s or [[Head of government|Heads of Government]] and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO’s policies are generally taken.  However, it is worth noting that the Council  has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets.

The meetings of the North Atlantic Council are chaired by the [[Secretary General of NATO|Secretary General]] of NATO and, when decisions have to be made, action is agreed upon on the basis of unanimity and common accord. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each nation represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own decisions.

The second pivotal member of each country's delegation is the Military Representative, a senior officer from each country's armed forces. Together the Military Representatives form the Military Committee, a  body responsible for recommending to NATO’s political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to the NATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and is responsible for the overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council.  
Like the council, from time to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of defence, the most senior military officer in each nation's armed forces.

The [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]] is made up of legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as 13 associate members.<ref>http://www.nato-pa.int/Default.asp?SHORTCUT=1</ref>

===Military structure===

[[Image:Nato awacs.jpg|thumb|right|240px|NATO E-3A flying with [[United States Air Force|American]] [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] in NATO exercise]] 

NATO’s military operations are directed by two Strategic Commanders, both senior U.S. officers assisted by a staff drawn from across NATO. The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the Military Committee for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of command.

Before 2003 the Strategic Commanders were the [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR) and the [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] (SACLANT) but the current arrangement is to separate command responsibility between [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT), responsible for transformation and training of NATO forces, and [[Allied Command Operations]], responsible for NATO operations world wide.

The commander of Allied Command Operations retained the title "Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)", and is based in the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ([[SHAPE]]) located at [[Casteau]], north of the [[Belgian]] city of [[Mons]]. This is about 80 km (50 miles) south of NATO’s political headquarters in Brussels. Allied Command Transformation (ACT) is based in the former Allied Command Atlantic headquarters in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[USA]].

== NATO bases ==

Since its creation NATO disposes of a serie of bases in various countries.

It operates a fleet of [[E-3 Sentry|E-3A Sentry]] [[AWACS]] airborne radar aircraft based out of [[NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen|Geilenkirchen Air Base]] in Germany, and is establishing the [[NATO Strategic Airlift Capability]] through the planned purchase of a number of C-17s.

[[Ramstein Air Base]] in West Germany was an important strategic center, and remained so today. 

[[Condoleezza Rice]] has signed the [[Defense Cooperation Agreement]] with Sofia (Bulgaria), a new NATO member. The treaty allows the US (not NATO) to develop as joint US-Bulgarian facilities the Bulgarian air bases at [[Bezmer]] (near [[Yambol]]) and [[Graf Ignatievo]] (near [[Plovdiv]]), the [[Novo Selo]] training range (near [[Sliven]]), and a logistics centre in [[Aytos]], as well as to use the commercial port of [[Burgas]]. At least 2.500 US militaries will be located there. The treaty also allows the US to use the bases "for missions in tiers country without a specific authorization from Bulgarian authorities," and protect US militaries from any juridical pursuits against them in this country <ref name="Dilucci">[http://www.legrandsoir.info/article.php3?id_article=3651 OTAN - Le grand jeu des bases militaires en terre européenne], Manlio Dilucci, French translation published on May 9, 2006 in ''[[Le Grand Soir]]'' newspaper of an article originally published in ''[[Il Manifesto]]'' on April 30, 2006 </ref>. Another agreement with Romania permits the US to use the [[Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport|Mihail Kogălniceanu]] base and another one nearby <ref name="Dilucci"/>.

OTAN's Naval Forces' headquarters will be relocated from London to [[Napoli]] (Italy), where NATO's [[Joint Force Command]] (headed by a US general) is also based. NATO inaugurated a new base in 2004 in [[Chiapparo nel Mar Grande Taranto]] <ref> [http://www.ilmanifesto.it/g8/dopogenova/40ddd5214bf50.html Il nuovo fronte è a sud-est], Manlio Dinucci, ''[[Il Manifesto]]'', June 26, 2004 {{it icon}} </ref> The enlargement of a base in [[Vicenza]], previsioned for 2007, suscited some opposition from [[Romano Prodi]]'s government, although it finally accepted the relocation <ref> [http://www.ilmanifesto.it/ricerca/ric_view.php3?page=/oggi/art23.html&word=manlio;dinucci Perché è un problema politico l'ampliamento della base Usa], Manlio Dinucci, ''[[Il Manifesto]]'', January 18, 2007 {{it icon}} </ref>.

In Spain, [[Zaragossa]] is expected to host the new [[Alliance Ground Surveillance]] (AGS) system of NATO, produced by the [[Transatlantic Industrial Proposed Solution]] (TIPS) consortium with the goal of having an initial operational capability in 2010 <ref> [http://www.nato.int/issues/ags/index.html Alliance Ground Surveillance], NATO (last updated on October 27, 2006 &mdash; URL accessed on January 18, 2007 </ref>. As in Italy, this has been met with some opposition from various [[anti-militarist]] sectors of Spanish society <ref> [http://www.antimilitaristas.org/article.php3?id_article=2591  El gobierno español pretende que la OTAN instale en Zaragoza el centro de mando del sistema de vigilancia y espionaje global de los Estados Unidos], June 28, 2006 on www.antimilitaristas.org, {{es icon}} </ref>.
