Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in [[vitalism]], spiritual inspiration and [[rationalism]]. A philosophy based on [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[Dogma|irrefutable doctrine]] helped distinguish chiropractic from medicine, provided it with legal and political defenses against claims of practicing medicine without a license, and allowed chiropractors to establish themselves as an autonomous profession. This "straight" philosophy, taught to generations of chiropractors, rejects the [[Inference|inferential reasoning]] of the [[scientific method]],<ref name=Keating05/> and relies on deductions from [[vitalistic]] first principles rather than on the [[materialism]] of science.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/> However, most practitioners currently accept the importance of scientific research into chiropractic,<ref name=Keating05>{{cite book |author= Keating JC Jr |chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic |pages=77–98 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.''

Chiropractic is often described as two professions in one. Unlike the distinction between [[podiatry]] (a science-based profession for foot disorders) and foot [[reflexology]] (an unscientific philosophy which posits that many disorders arise from the feet), in chiropractic the two professions attempt to live under one roof.<ref name=Murphy-pod/> Significant differences exist amongst the practice styles, claims and beliefs between various chiropractors.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://chiroweb.com/archives/08/21/13.html |title= It's where you put the period |journal= [[Dyn Chiropr]] |volume=8 |issue=21 |author= Healey JW |date=1990}}</ref>

''Straight'' chiropractors adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D.D. and B.J. Palmer, and retain [[metaphysical]] definitions and [[vitalistic]] qualities. Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an "[[Innate Intelligence]]" exerted via the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for almost any disease. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for chiropractic treatment. Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not "mix" other types of therapies.<ref name=History-Primer/> Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon (i.e. perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment, etc.). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care.

''Mixer'' chiropractors "mix" diagnostic and treatment approaches from osteopathic, medical, and chiropractic viewpoints. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of many causes of disease, and they incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ many treatments including conventional techniques of [[physical therapy]] such as exercise, [[massage]], [[ice pack]]s, and [[moist heat]], along with [[nutritional supplements]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]], and [[biofeedback]]. Mixers tend to be open to mainstream medicine, and are the majority group.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg>{{cite journal |journal= [[Arch Intern Med]] |date=1998 |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215–24 |title= Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |author= Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |pmid=9818801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215 |doi= 10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215}}</ref>

=== Vertebral subluxation ===
{{main|Vertebral subluxation}}
Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed ''vertebral subluxations'', interfered with the body's function and its inborn (innate) ability to heal itself.<ref name=History-PPC>{{cite book |author= [[Joseph C. Keating, Jr.|Keating JC Jr]] |chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession |pages=23–64 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> D.D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ. D.D. Palmer, using a [[vitalism|vitalistic]] approach, imbued the term ''subluxation'' with a metaphysical and [[philosophical]] meaning. He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf |format=PDF |title= D.D. Palmer's forgotten theories of chiropractic |author= Keating JC Jr |publisher= [[Association for the History of Chiropractic]] |date=1995 |accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic medicine from conventional medicine. In 1910, D.D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:

:"Physiologists divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, afferent and efferent. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality—too much or not enough action—which is disease."<ref>{{cite book |author= Palmer DD |title= The Chiropractor's Adjuster: Text-book of the Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic for Students and Practitioners |location=Portland, OR |publisher= Portland Printing House Co |date=1910 |oclc=17205743}}</ref>

The concept of subluxation remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.<ref name=Keating-subluxation/> In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.<ref name=Keating-subluxation>{{cite journal |journal= [[Chiropr Osteopat]] |date=2005 |volume=13 |pages=17 |title= Subluxation: dogma or science? |author= Keating JC Jr, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF |doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-17 |pmid=16092955 |url=http://chiroandosteo.com/content/13/1/17}}</ref> This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic (for example, [[Palmer College of Chiropractic]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palmer.edu/general_content.aspx?id=2630 |title=Palmer College of Chiropractic, General Information |accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref>) still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others (for example, [[Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cmcc.ca/PDF/2006/CMCC_Calendar06to07.pdf |format=PDF |title= Undergraduate and graduate programs 2006–2007 |publisher= [[Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]] |date=2006 |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref>) have moved towards an [[evidence-based]] chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[The Journal of Chiropractic Education]] |date=2000 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=71–7 |title=A Survey of the Use of Evidence-Based Health Care in Chiropractic College Clinics |author=Kevin A.

It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity." This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as [[X-ray#Medical_uses|X-rays]].<ref name=WHO-guidelines>{{cite paper |author= World Health Organization |date=2005 |title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |id= ISBN 92-4-159371-7 |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref>

{{Main|Chiropractic treatment techniques|Spinal adjustment}}

[[Spinal manipulation]], which chiropractors call "spinal adjustment" or "chiropractic adjustment", is the most common treatment used in chiropractic care;<ref name=NBCE_techniques/> in the U.S., chiropractors perform over 90% of all manipulative treatments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/chiropractic/chiropractic05.pdf |format=PDF |title=About chiropractic and its use in treating low-back pain |accessdate=2008-03-24 |date=2005 |publisher=[[NCCAM]]}}</ref> Spinal manipulation is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal range of movement, but not so far as to dislocate or damage the joint; its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, which is a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion.<!-- <ref name=ACA-SMP/> --> More generally, [[spinal manipulative therapy]] (SMT) describes techniques where the hands are used to manipulate, massage, mobilize, adjust, stimulate, apply traction to, or otherwise influence the spine and related tissues; in chiropractic care SMT most commonly takes the form of spinal manipulation.<ref name=ACA-SMP>{{cite web |url=http://acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf |format=PDF |title= Spinal manipulation policy statement |author= Winkler K, Hegetschweiler-Goertz C, Jackson PS ''et al.'' |accessdate=2008-05-24 |date=2003 |publisher= American Chiropractic Association}}</ref>

There are several schools of chiropractic adjustive techniques, although most chiropractors mix techniques from several schools. The following adjustive procedures were received by more than 20% of patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey:<ref name=NBCE_techniques/> [[Diversified technique]] (full-spine manipulation), extremity adjusting, [[Activator technique]] (which uses a spring loaded tool to deliver precise adjustments to the spine), [[Robert N. Thompson|Thompson]] Technique, Gonstead (which looks at the whole spine with the philosophy that a vertebral misalignment may affect other areas of the spine, emphasizing the mechanical aspects of the spine), Cox/flexion-distraction (a gentle, non-force adjusting procedure which mixes chiropractic principles with osteopathic principles and utilizes specialized adjusting tables with movable parts), adjustive instrument, Sacro-Occipital Technique (which models the spine as a torsion bar), [[Neuromuscular therapy|Nimmo Receptor-Tonus Technique]], and [[Applied Kinesiology]] (which emphasises "muscle testing" as a diagnostic tool).<ref>{{cite book |title= Technique Systems in Chiropractic |author= Cooperstein R, Gleberzon BJ |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |year=2004 |isbn=0-443-07413-5}}</ref> Medicine-assisted manipulation, such as [[manipulation under anesthesia]], involves sedation or local anesthetic and is done by a team that includes an [[anesthesiologist]].<ref name=Dagenais>{{cite journal |author= Dagenais S, Mayer J, Wooley JR, Haldeman S |title= Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with medicine-assisted manipulation |journal= Spine J |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=142–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18164462 |doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2007.09.010}}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|Chiropractic history}}

[[Image:ddpalmer3.jpg|thumb|D.D. Palmer]]

Chiropractic was founded in the 1890s by [[Daniel David Palmer|Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. Palmer, a [[Magnetic healing|magnetic healer]], hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease. Although initially keeping the theory a family secret, in 1898 he began teaching it to a few students at his new [[Palmer School of Chiropractic]]. One student, his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|Bartlett Joshua (B.J.) Palmer]], became committed to promoting chiropractic, took over the Palmer School in 1906, and rapidly expanded its enrollment.<ref name=Martin>{{cite journal |journal= [[Technol Cult]] |author= Martin SC |date=1993 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=808–34 |title= Chiropractic and the social context of medical technology, 1895-1925 |doi=10.2307/3106416 |pmid=11623404}}</ref> Prosecutions and incarcerations of chiropractors for practicing medicine without a license grew common, and to defend against medical statutes B.J. argued that chiropractic was separate and distinct from medicine, asserting that chiropractors "analyzed" rather than "diagnosed", and "adjusted" subluxations rather than "treated" disease.<ref name=History-Primer/> Early chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of [[innate intelligence]], a [[Vitalism|vital]] nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions. D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|legal protection under the U.S. constitution]], but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]].<ref name=Martin/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf |format=PDF |author= Palmer DD |title= Letter to P.W. Johnson, D.C. |date=1911-05-04 |accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> Early chiropractors also tapped into the [[Populism|Populist]] movement, emphasizing craft, hard work, competition, and advertisement, aligning themselves with the common man against intellectuals and [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]], among which they included the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).<ref name=Martin/>

[[Image:BJPalmer2.jpg|thumb|left|141px|B.J. Palmer]]
Although D.D. and B.J. were "straight" and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called "mixers", advocated use of instruments. In 1910 B.J. changed course and endorsed [[X-rays]] as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students. The mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight.<!-- <ref name=Martin/> --> That year, B.J.'s promotion of the neurocalometer, a new temperature-sensing device, was another sign of chiropractic's gradual acceptance of medical technology, although it was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights.<!-- <ref name=Martin/> --> Despite heavy opposition by organized medicine, by the 1930s chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.<ref name=Martin/> The longstanding feud between chiropractors and [[medical doctor]]s continued for decades. Until 1983, the AMA labeled chiropractic "an unscientific [[cult]]" and held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with an "unscientific practitioner".<ref>{{cite journal |journal= [[Am J Public Health]] |date=1989 |volume=79 |issue=11 |pages=1569–70 |title= AMA policy on chiropractic |author= Cherkin D |pmid=2817179 |pmc=1349822}}</ref> This culminated in a landmark 1987 decision, [[Wilk v. American Medical Association|''Wilk v. AMA'']], in which the court found that the AMA had engaged in unreasonable restraint of trade and conspiracy, and which ended the AMA's de facto boycott of chiropractic.<ref name=Cooper/>

Serious research to test chiropractic theories did not begin until the 1970s, and was hampered by what are characterized as [[antiscientific]] and [[pseudoscientific]] ideas that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine.<!-- <ref name=History-Primer/> duplicate of next ref --> By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish clinical guidelines that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain.<ref name=History-Primer>{{cite web |title= Chiropractic history: a primer |author= Keating JC Jr, Cleveland CS III, Menke M |url=http://data.memberclicks.com/site/ahc/ChiroHistoryPrimer.pdf |format=PDF |date=2005 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher= Association for the History of Chiropractic}}</ref> In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by medical physicians and [[health plan]]s, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services. However, its future seemed uncertain: as the number of practitioners grew, [[evidence-based medicine]] insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, [[managed care]] restricted payment, and competition grew from [[massage therapist]]s and other health professions. The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into [[alternative medicine]] and [[primary care]].<ref name=Cooper>{{cite journal |journal= [[Milbank Q]] |date=2003 |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=107–38 |title= Chiropractic in the United States: trends and issues |author= Cooper RA, McKee HJ |doi=10.1111/1468-0009.00040 |pmid=12669653}}</ref>

== Evidence basis ==

The principles of [[evidence-based medicine]] have been used to review research studies and generate practice guidelines outlining professional standards that specify which chiropractic treatments are legitimate and perhaps reimbursable under [[managed care]].<ref name=Villanueva-Russell/> Evidence-based guidelines are supported by one end of an ideological continuum among chiropractors; the other end employs what is considered by many chiropractic researchers to be [[antiscientific]] reasoning and unsubstantiated claims,<ref name=Nelson/><ref name=History-Primer2>{{cite web |title= Chiropractic history: a primer |author= Keating JC Jr, Cleveland CS III, Menke M |url=http://data.memberclicks.com/site/ahc/ChiroHistoryPrimer.pdf |format=PDF |date=2005 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher= Association for the History of Chiropractic |quote= A significant and continuing barrier to scientific progress within chiropractic are the anti-scientific and pseudo-scientific ideas (Keating 1997b) which have sustained the profession throughout a century of intense struggle with political medicine. Chiropractors' tendency to assert the meaningfulness of various theories and methods as a counterpoint to allopathic charges of quackery has created a defensiveness which can make critical examination of chiropractic concepts difficult (Keating and Mootz 1989).

=== Safety ===

Chiropractic care in general is safe when employed skillfully and appropriately. Manipulation is regarded as relatively safe, but as with all therapeutic interventions, complications can arise, and it has known adverse effects, risks and contraindications. <!-- <ref name=WHO-guidelines/> --> Absolute [[contraindication]]s to spinal manipulative therapy are conditions that should not be manipulated; these contraindications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and conditions known to result in unstable joints. Relative contraindications are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where low-force and soft-tissue techniques are treatments of choice; these contraindications include [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> Although most contraindications apply only to manipulation of the affected region, some neurological signs indicate referral to [[emergency medical services]]; these include sudden and severe [[headache]] or [[neck pain]] unlike that previously experienced.<ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG>{{cite journal |journal= J Can Chiropr Assoc |date=2005 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=158–209 |title= Chiropractic clinical practice guideline: evidence-based treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Blouin JS, Bryans R ''et al.'' |url=http://www.jcca-online.org/Client/cca/jcca.nsf/objects/jcca-v49-3-158/$file/jcca-v49-3-158.pdf |format=PDF}}<br/>• {{cite journal |journal= J Can Chiropr Assoc |date=2008 |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=7–8 |title= A clinical practice guideline update from The CCA•CFCREAB-CPG |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Bryans B, Descarreaux M ''et al.'' |url=http://www.jcca-online.org/Client/cca/JCCA.nsf/objects/JCCA_March_2008_52_1/$file/jcca-v52-1-007.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>
