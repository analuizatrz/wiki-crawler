An '''aircraft carrier''' is a [[warship]] designed to deploy and recover [[aircraft]] &mdash; in effect acting as a sea-going [[airbase]]. Aircraft carriers thus allow a [[navy|naval]] force to project [[air power]] great distances without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft.

Modern navies that operate such ships treat aircraft carriers as the [[capital ship]] of the fleet, a role previously played by the [[battleship]]. The change, part of the growth of air power as a significant part of warfare, took place during [[World War II]]. This change was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. 

Unescorted carriers are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines or missiles and therefore travel as part of a [[carrier battle group]] (CVBG), which is now known as a [[Carrier Strike Group]] (CSG) in the US Navy or [[Expeditionary Strike Group]] (ESG) if the carrier is an [[LHD (hull classification symbol|LHD]] or [[LHA (hull classification symbol)|LHA]]. Unlike other types of capital ships in the 20th century, aircraft carrier designs since World War II have been effectively unlimited by any consideration save budgetary, and the ships have increased in size to handle the larger aircraft: The large, modern [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'' class]] of United States Navy carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II-era [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'']] yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same.

==Flight deck==
[[Image:FlightOps launch.jpg|thumb|Flight operations on the deck of [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']].]]

{{main|Flight deck}}
As "runways at sea," modern aircraft carriers have a flat-top deck design that serves as a [[flight deck]] for [[take off|take-off]] and [[landing]] of aircraft. Aircraft take off to the front, into the wind, and land from the rear. Carriers steam at speed, for example up to 35&nbsp;[[knot (nautical)|knots]] (65&nbsp;km/h), into the wind during take-off in order to increase the [[apparent wind]] speed, thereby reducing the speed of the aircraft relative to the ship. On some ships, a steam-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is used to propel the aircraft forward assisting the power of its engines and allowing it to take off in a shorter distance than would otherwise be required, even with the headwind effect of the ship's course. On other carriers, aircraft do not require assistance for take off — the requirement for assistance relates to aircraft design and performance. Conversely, when landing on a carrier, conventional aircraft rely upon a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring them to a stop in a shorter distance than normal. Other aircraft — [[helicopter]]s and [[V/STOL]] (Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing) designs — utilize their hover capability to land vertically and so require no assistance in speed reduction upon landing.

Conventional ("tailhook") aircraft rely upon a [[landing signal officer]] (LSO) to control the plane's landing approach, visually gauging altitude, attitude, and speed, and transmitting that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot. From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as mirrors provided information on proper [[glide slope]], but LSOs still transmit voice calls to landing pilots by radio.

Since the early 1950s it has been common to direct the landing recovery area off to port at an angle to the line of the ship. The primary function of the angled deck landing area is to allow aircraft who miss the arresting wires, referred to as a "bolter", to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked on the forward parts of the deck. The angled deck also allows launching of aircraft at the same time as others land.

[[Image:USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75) Flight Deck.JPG|thumb|right|[[F/A-18 Hornet]]s on the [[flight deck]] of the [[Nimitz class carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] [[supercarrier]] [[USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75)|''Harry S. Truman'']]]]
The above deck areas of the warship (the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]], and so on) are concentrated to the [[starboard]] side of the deck in a relatively small area called an "island". Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island and such a configuration has not been seen in a fleet sized carrier.

A more recent configuration, used by the British [[Royal Navy]], has a 'ski-jump' ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was developed to help launch [[VTOL]] (or [[STOVL]]) aircraft (aircraft that are able to take off and land with little or no forward movement) such as the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]]. Although the aircraft are capable of flying vertically off the deck, using the ramp is more fuel efficient. As catapults and arrestor cables are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for equipment. The disadvantage of the ski jump — and hence, the reason this configuration has not appeared on American supercarriers — is the penalty that it exacts on aircraft size, payload and fuel load (and hence, range): Large, slow planes such as the [[E-2 Hawkeye]] and heavily-laden strike fighters like the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] cannot use a ski jump because their high weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck (even on the large [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']], lightly-loaded [[Sukhoi Su-23|Su-33 'Flanker-D']] air superiority fighters require almost the entire length of the deck to take off) or catapult assistance.

==Common types==
Over the course of the last century there have been several types of aircraft carrier, some of which are now obsolete. They can be generally categorized as follows:

===Initial designs and inter-war developments===
* [[Balloon carrier]]s were used during in the 19th and early 20th century, mainly for observation purposes.
* [[Seaplane tender]]s, such as [[HMS Engadine (1911)|HMS ''Engadine'']],  and [[USS Avocet AVP-4]] [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/a14/avocet-i.htm]continued to be used through World War 2. Though seaplanes are inferior to conventional aircraft in the role of a fighter, they are very valuable for patrol and rescue missions among others. The USN actually converted its first aircraft carrier, [[USS Langley (CV-1)]], to a seaplane tender (designated AV-3) in 1937 and it continued in this role until sunk early in the war.[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/l3/langley-i.htm]
* Standard carriers, such as [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], typically 20,000 to 65,000&nbsp;tonnes, and often known as "fleet carriers"
* Flying aircraft carrier; [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/a4/akron.htm] an airship that can carry aircraft. Examples include [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)|USS ''Akron'']] and [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|''Macon'']]

===World War II developments===
* [[Escort aircraft carrier]]s, such as [[USS Barnes (CVE-20)|USS ''Barnes'']], were built only during World War II, and were used by the British Royal Navy and U.S. Navy
* [[Light aircraft carrier]]s, such as [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|USS ''Independence'']], were designed to primarily carry fighters
* [[CAM ship]]s, such as [[SS Michael E|SS ''Michael E'']], cargo carrying merchant ships which could launch but not retrieve fighter aircraft. These vessels were an emergency measure during World War II
* [[Merchant aircraft carrier]]s (MACs), such as [[MV Empire MacAlpine|MV ''Empire MacAlpine'']], another emergency measure which saw cargo-carrying merchant ships equipped with flight decks
* [[Battlecarrier]]s were created by the Imperial Japanese Navy to partially compensate for the loss of carrier strength at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]]. Two of them were made from [[Ise class battleship|''Ise'' class]] battleships during late 1943. The aft turrets were removed and replaced with a hangar, deck and catapult. The heavy cruiser [[Mogami|''Mogami'']] concurrently received a similar conversion. With half a flight deck and half of a battleship's armament, the ships were singularly worthless and seldom left port.
* [[Submarine aircraft carrier]]s, such as the French [[French submarine Surcouf|''Surcouf'']], or the Japanese [[I-400 class submarine]]s which were capable of carrying 3 [[Aichi]] [[Aichi M6A|M6A ''Seiran'']] aircraft. The first of these were built in the 1920s

Some [[cruiser (warship)|cruisers]] and [[capital ship]]s of the inter-war years often carried a catapult launched seaplane for reconnaissance and spotting the fall of the guns. It was launched by a catapult and recovered by crane from the water after landing. These were highly successful during World War II; there were many notable successes early in the war as shown by [[HMS Warspite (1913)|HMS ''Warspite'']]’s float equipped [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] during operations in the Norwegian fjords in 1940. The Japanese Rufe floatplane derived from the Zero was a formidable fighter with only a slight loss in flight performance, one of their pilots scored 26 kills in the [[A6M2-N Rufe]]; a score only bettered by a handful of American pilots throughout WW2. Other Japanese seaplanes launched from tenders and warships sank merchant ships and small-scale ground attacks.  The culmination of the type was the American 300+ mph (480&nbsp;km/h) Curtiss [[SC Seahawk]] which was actually a fighter aircraft like the Rufe in addition to a two-seat gunnery spotter and transport for an injured man in a litter. Spotter seaplane aircraft on U.S. Navy cruisers and battleships were in service until 1949. Seaplane fighters were considered poor combat aircraft compared to their carrier-launched brethren; they were slower due to the drag of their pontoons or boat hulls. Contemporary propellor-driven, landplane fighter aircraft were much faster (450-480 mph / 720&ndash;770&nbsp;km/h as opposed to 300-350 mph / 480&ndash;560&nbsp;km/h) and more heavily armed. The Curtiss Seahawk only had two 0.50 inch (12.7&nbsp;mm) calibre machine guns compared to four 20&nbsp;mm cannon in the Grumman [[F8F Bearcat]] or four 0.50 (12.7&nbsp;mm) cal machine guns plus two 20&nbsp;mm cannon in the Vought [[F4U Corsair]]. Jet aircraft of just a few years later were faster still (500+ mph) and still better armed, especially with the development of [[air to air missile]]s in the early to mid 1950s.

<!-- By World War II, [[seaplane tender]]s were no longer considered as the main method to project air power at sea due to the lessened flight performance of their seaplanes over land and carrier-based planes. Carriers could operate conventional aircraft that could fly farther, faster, and carry more weapons, all while boasting greater performance. However, seaplane tenders in conjunction with PBY Catalina patrol bombers could range farther across the oceans than short-range carrier planes as the "eyes of the fleet" and rescued thousands of men stranded in the water who would have perished otherwise. As the end of the war neared, early helicopters were taking over many of the roles of [[seaplane]]s but at a marked loss in speed, range and flexibility that has not been regained to the present day. In the 1950s the aerodynamic limitations of seaplanes had finally been overcome; several seaplane designs were superior in performance to their land-based counterparts; the P6M Seamaster patrol bomber and [[R3Y Tradewind]] "Flying LST" transport planes flew faster than the B-52 and the C-130; but in a power struggle with the ruling aircraft carrier bureaucracy were cancelled despite that their use in conjunction with special seaplane tenders would be more tactically and cost effective than large, vulnerable aircraft carriers operating shorter ranged and lesser payload aircraft.{{fact}} Commented out until this section can be rewritten in an NPOV manner -->

===Post-war developments===
* [[Amphibious assault ship|Amphibious assault carriers]], such as [[USS Tarawa (LHA-1)|USS ''Tarawa'']], which often also serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as "commando carriers" or "helicopter carriers".
* [[Anti-submarine warfare carrier]]s, also known as "helicopter carriers."
* [[Supercarrier]]s, such as [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)|USS ''Nimitz'']], typically 75,000&nbsp;tonnes or greater. Many are powered by nuclear reactors and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home. As of [[January 1]] [[2007]] the [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)]] and the [[USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)]] are the only conventional (non-nuclear) supercarriers in service.

Many modern warships have [[helicopter]] landing capability and helicopter assault ships represent a new form of amphibious assault carrier.

In the immediate post war era there was interest in jet propelled seaplanes which would avoid the limitations imposed by jet aircraft on aircraft carriers. The most advanced of these were the flying-boat jet fighters; the US [[F2Y Sea Dart]] (1953) and UK [[Saunders-Roe SR.A/1]] (1947). In the event carrier design caught up quickly and military seaplanes passed largely into history though not before the F2Y set the record for being the only flying boat ever to travel faster than sound.

==History and milestones==
Though aircraft carriers are given their definition with respect to fixed-wing aircraft, the first known instance of using a ship for airborne operations occurred in 1806, when the British Royal Navy's Lord [[Thomas Cochrane]] launched kites from the 32-gun frigate ''[[HMS Pallas]]'' in order to drop propaganda leaflets on the French territory.

===Balloon carriers===
{{main|Balloon carrier}}
[[image:balloon barge.jpg|thumb|left|The Union Army balloon ''Washington'' aboard the ''George Washington Parke Custis'', towed by the tug '' Coeur de Lion''.]]
On [[July 12]], [[1849]], the Austrian Navy ship ''Vulcano'' launched a manned hot air balloon in order to drop bombs on [[Venice]], although the attempt failed due to contrary winds.<ref>[http://www.sandcastlevi.com/sea/carriers/cvchap1a.htm Reference]</ref>

Later, during the [[American Civil War]], about the time of the [[Peninsula Campaign]], gas-filled [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]s were being used to perform reconnaissance on Confederate positions, the battles turned inland into the heavily forested areas of the Peninsula where balloons could not travel. A coal barge, the George Washington Parke Custis, was cleared of all deck rigging to accommodate the gas generators and apparatus of balloons. From the GWP Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]], Chief Aeronaut of the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]], made his first ascents over the [[Potomac River]] and telegraphed claims of the success of the first aerial venture ever made from a water-borne vessel. Other barges were converted to assist with the other military balloons transported about the eastern waterways. It is only fair to point out in deference to modern aircraft carriers that none of these Civil War crafts had ever taken to the high seas.
[[Image:RussBalloonCarrier.jpg|thumb|The Russian captive balloon carrier ''Russ'' in 1904.]]
Balloons launched from ships led to the development of [[balloon carrier]]s, or balloon tenders, during [[World War I]], by the navies of Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Sweden. About ten such "balloon tenders" were built, their main objective being aerial observation posts. These ships were either decommissioned or converted to [[seaplane tender]]s after the war.

===Seaplane carriers===
{{main|Seaplane carrier}}
[[Image:CanardVoisinJune1912.jpg|thumb|left|The first seaplane carrier, the French ''[[La Foudre]]'' (right, with hangar and crane), with one of her ''[[Canard Voisin]]'' seaplanes taking off, during tactical exercises in June 1912.]]
The invention of the [[seaplane]] in March 1910 with the French ''[[Le Canard]]'' led to the earliest development of a ship designed to carry airplanes, albeit equipped with floats: in December [[1911]] appears the French Navy ''[[La Foudre]]'', the first [[seaplane carrier]], and the first known carrier of [[airplanes]]. Commissioned as a seaplane tender, and carrying float-equipped planes under hangars on the main deck, from where they were lowered on the sea with a crane, she participated in tactical exercises in the Mediterranean in 1912. ''La Foudre'' was further modified in November 1913 with a 10 meters flat deck to launch her seaplanes.<ref>[http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/france.htm#foud Description]and [http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/images/europe/foudre-2.jpg photograph] of ''Foudre''</ref>

[[HMS Hermes (1913)|HMS ''Hermes'']], temporarily converted as an experimental seaplane carrier in April-May 1913, is also one of the first seaplane carriers, and the first experimental seaplane carrier of the British Navy. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a seaplane carrier for a few trials in 1913, before being converted again to a cruiser, and back again to a seaplane carrier in 1914. She was sunk by a German submarine in October 1914. The first seaplane tender of the US Navy was the [[USS Mississippi (BB-23)|USS ''Mississippi'']], converted to that role in December 1913.<ref>[http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/us_sea1.htm First US seaplane carrier, the USS ''Mississippi'']</ref>

===Genesis of the flat-deck carrier===

| style="text-align: left;" | "An airplane-carrying vessel is indispensable. These vessels will be constructed on a plan very different from what is currently used.

|-
| style="text-align: left;" | [[Clément Ader]], "[[L'Aviation Militaire]]", 1909
|}
As heavier-than-air aircraft developed in the early 20th century various navies began to take an interest in their potential use as scouts for their big gun warships. In [[1909]] the French inventor [[Clément Ader]] published in his book "[[L'Aviation Militaire]]" the description of a ship to operate airplanes at sea, with a flat flight deck, an island superstructure, deck elevators and a hangar bay.<ref>Clement Ader on the structure of the aircraft carrier:<br>
"An airplane-carrying vessel is indispensable. These vessels will be constructed on a plan very different from what is currently used. First of all the deck will be cleared of all obstacles. It will be flat, as wide as possible without jeopardizing the nautical lines of the hull, and it will look like a landing field." Military Aviation, p35<br>
On stowage:<br>
"Of necessity, the airplanes will be stowed below decks; they would be solidly fixed anchored to their bases, each in its place, so they would not be affected with the pitching and rolling. Access to this lower decks would be by an elevator sufficiently long and wide to hold an airplane with its wings folded. A large, sliding trap would cover the hole in the deck, and it would have waterproof joints, so that neither rain nor seawater, from heavy seas could penetrate below." Military Aviation, p36<br>
On the technique of landing:<br>
"The ship will be headed straight into the wind, the stern clear, but a padded bulwark set up forward in case the airplane should run past the stop line" Military Aviation, p37</ref> That year the US Naval Attaché in Paris sent a report on his observations.<ref>[http://www.sandcastlevi.com/sea/carriers/cvchap1b.htm Reference]</ref>

[[Image:Ely-takeoff.jpg|thumb|left|Ely takes off from<br>USS ''Birmingham'', [[14 November]] [[1910]].]]
A number of experimental flights were made to test the concept. [[Eugene Ely]] was the first [[Aviator|pilot]] to launch from a stationary ship in November 1910. He took off from a structure fixed over the forecastle of the US [[armored cruiser]] [[USS Birmingham (CL-2)|USS ''Birmingham'']] at [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] and landed nearby on [[Willoughby Spit]] after some five minutes in the air.
[[Image:Ely_landing_on_Pennsylvania,_1910.jpg|thumb|Ely lands on USS ''Pennsylvania'', <br>[[18 January]] [[1911]].]]
On [[January 18]] [[1911]] he became the first pilot to land on a stationary ship. He took off from the [[The Shops at Tanforan|Tanforan racetrack]] and landed on a similar temporary structure on the aft of [[USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4)|USS ''Pennsylvania'']] anchored at the [[San Francisco]] waterfront &mdash; the improvised braking system of sandbags and ropes led directly to the arrestor hook and wires described above. His aircraft was then turned around and he was able to take off again. [[Commander]] Charles Samson, [[Royal Navy|RN]], became the first airman to take off from a moving warship on [[May 2]] [[1912]]. He took off in a [[Short S27]] from the battleship [[HMS Hibernia (1905)|HMS ''Hibernia'']] while she steamed at 10.5&nbsp;knots (19&nbsp;km/h) during the [[Royal Fleet Review]] at [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]].

[[Image:Ark Royal (1914).jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ark Royal (1914)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], a seaplane carrier also equipped with two regular airplanes, was arguably the first modern aircraft carrier.]]
[[HMS Ark Royal (1914)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] was arguably the first modern aircraft carrier. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a hybrid airplane/ seaplane carrier. Launched in 1914, she served in the [[Dardanelles]] campaign and throughout World War I.

The first strike from a carrier against a land target took place on [[December 25]] [[1914]]. When Twelve seaplanes from HMS' Engadine, Riviera and Empress (cross-channel steamers converted into seaplane carriers )attacked the Zeppelin base at Cuxhaven.The attack was not a success. Other carrier operations were mounted during the war the most successful taking place on 19 July 1918 when seven [[Sopwith Camel]]s launched from [[HMS Furious (1916)|HMS ''Furious'']] attacked the German [[Zeppelin]] base at [[Tondern]], with two 50&nbsp;lb bombs each. Several [[airship]]s and [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]s were destroyed, but as the carrier had no method of recovering the aircraft safely, two of the pilots ditched their aircraft in the sea alongside the carrier while the others headed for neutral [[Denmark]].

===Inter-war years===
[[Image:H42235.jpg|thumb|right|The first full-length flat deck, [[HMS Argus (I49)|HMS ''Argus'']] in 1918]]
The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 placed strict limits on the tonnages of battleships and [[battlecruiser]]s for the major naval powers after [[World War I]], as well as limits not only on the total tonnage for carriers, but also an upper limit on 27,000&nbsp;tonnes for each ship. Although exceptions were made regarding the max ship tonnage (fleet units counted, experimental units did not), the total tonnage could not be exceeded. However, while all of the major navies were over-tonnage on battleships, they were all considerably under-tonnage on aircraft carriers. Consequently, many battleships and battlecruisers under construction (or in service) were converted into aircraft carriers. The first ship to have a full length flat deck was [[HMS Argus (1917)|HMS ''Argus'']] the conversion of which was completed in September 1918, with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] not following suit until 1920, when the conversion of [[USS Langley (CV-1)|USS ''Langley'']] (an experimental ship which did not count against America's carrier tonnage) had completed. The first American fleet carriers would not join the service until [[Lexington class aircraft carrier|1928]] ([[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] and [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|''Saratoga'']]).

[[Image:Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho.jpg|thumb|right|The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier to be commissioned, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō|''Hōshō'']], in 1922. Though she was not the first purpose designed carrier that construction started on ([[HMS Hermes (1923)|HMS ''Hermes'']] was), her construction finished sooner. Critics of this claim note the hull was still a modified cruiser type and not a purpose designed hull, as on the British ship.]]

The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier to be developed was the [[HMS Hermes (1923)|HMS ''Hermes'']], although the first one to be commissioned was the Japanese [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō|''Hōshō'']] (commissioned in December 1922, followed by HMS ''Hermes'' in July 1923).<ref>"Hōshō was a carrier from the keel, the first of its kind completed in any navy of the world" Scot MacDonald [http://www.history.navy.mil/download/car-7.pdf]</ref> ''Hermes''<nowiki>'</nowiki> design preceded and influenced that of ''Hōshō'', and its construction actually began earlier, but numerous tests, experiments and budget considerations delayed its commission.

By the late 1930s, aircraft carriers around the world typically carried three types of aircraft: [[torpedo bomber]]s, also used for conventional bombings and [[reconnaissance]]; [[dive bomber]]s, also used for reconnaissance (in the U.S. Navy, this type of aircraft were known as "scout bombers"); and [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] for fleet defence and bomber escort duties. Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, all these aircraft were of small, single-engined types, usually with [[folding wing]]s to facilitate storage.

===Second World War===
Aircraft carriers played a significant role in World War II. With seven aircraft carriers afloat, the British Royal Navy had a considerable numerical advantage at the start of the war as neither the Germans nor the Italians had carriers of their own. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] by [[Germany|German]] battlecruisers during the Norwegian campaign in 1940. 

This apparent weakness to battleships was turned on its head in November 1940 when [[HMS Illustrious (R87)|HMS ''Illustrious'']] launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]]. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships in the harbour at a cost of two of the 21 attacking [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bombers]]. Carriers also played a major part in reinforcing [[Malta]], both by transporting planes and by defending convoys sent to supply the besieged island. The use of carriers prevented the [[Italian Navy]] and land-based German aircraft from dominating the [[Mediterranean]] theatre.

In the Atlantic, aircraft from HMS ''Ark Royal'' and [[HMS Victorious (R38)|HMS ''Victorious'']] were responsible for slowing [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] during May 1941. Later in the war, escort carriers proved their worth guarding convoys crossing the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic]] oceans.

Many of the major battles in the [[Pacific]] involved aircraft carriers. [[Japan]] started the war with ten aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were six American aircraft carriers at the beginning of the hostilities, although only three of them were operating in the Pacific.

[[Image:Carrier shokaku.jpg|thumb|right|Planes from the Japanese aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shokaku|''Shokaku'']] preparing the attack on [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].]]

Drawing on the 1939 Japanese development of shallow water modifications for aerial torpedoes and the 1940 British aerial attack on the Italian fleet at [[Taranto]], the 1941 Japanese surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was a clear illustration of the [[power projection]] capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six flattops in a single striking unit marked a turning point in naval history, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. (Though Germany and Italy began construction of carriers, neither were completed. Of the two, Germany's ''[[German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' had the greater potential.)

Meanwhile, the Japanese began their advance through [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] by Japanese land-based aircraft drove home the need for this ship class for fleet defence from aerial attack. In April 1942, the Japanese fast carrier strike force ranged into the [[Indian Ocean raid|Indian Ocean]] and sank shipping, including the damaged and undefended carrier [[HMS Hermes (95)|HMS ''Hermes'']]. Smaller Allied fleets with inadequate aerial protection were forced to retreat or be destroyed. In the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]], US and Japanese fleets traded aircraft strikes in the first battle where neither side's ships sighted the other. At the [[Battle of Midway]] all four Japanese carriers engaged were sunk by planes from three American carriers (one of which was lost) and the battle is considered the turning point of the war in the Pacific. Notably, the battle was orchestrated by the Japanese to draw out American carriers that had proven very elusive and troublesome to the Japanese. 

[[Image:Shinano.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|''Shinano'']], might have been largest aircraft carrier of World War II to enter service, but was sunk before being completed]]
Subsequently the US was able to build up large numbers of aircraft aboard a mixture of fleet, light and (newly commissioned) escort carriers, primarily with the introduction of the [[Essex class aircraft carrier|Essex class]] in 1943. These ships, around which were built the fast carrier task forces of the [[United States 3rd Fleet|Third]] and [[United States 5th Fleet|Fifth Fleets]], played a major part in winning the [[Pacific war]]. The eclipse of the battleship as the primary component of a fleet was clearly illustrated by the sinking of the largest battleship ever built, [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], by carrier-borne aircraft in 1945. Japan also built the largest aircraft carrier of the war, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|''Shinano'']], which was a ''Yamato'' class ship converted mid-way through construction after the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at Midway. She was sunk by a patrolling US submarine while in transit shortly after commissioning, but before being fully outfitted or operational in November 1944.

==Wartime innovations==
[[Image:HIJMS_Taiho_02.jpg|thumb|Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Taihō|''Taihō'']] with the hurricane bow.]]

Combat experience proved that the British invention of the sealed "hurricane bow" which protected against storms was superior to any other use for the very front of the ship, be it machine-guns or a second flight deck. This became standard for British and American carriers. The Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Taihō|''Taihō'']] was the first of their ships to incorporate it.

Starting late in the war with the [[Midway class aircraft carrier|''Midway'' class]], American carriers had grown so large that it was no longer practical to continue the concept of designing the hangar deck to be the strength deck, and all subsequent American carriers have the flight deck as the strength deck, leaving only the island as superstructure.

===Light Aircraft Carriers===

The loss of three major carriers in quick succession in the Pacific led the US Navy to develop the light carrier (CVL) from [[light cruiser]] hulls that had already been laid down. These were intended to add fighter squadrons to a task force, and were used in the US Navy only during World War II. The actual U.S. Navy classification was small aircraft carrier (CVL), not light. Prior to July [[1943]], they were just classified as aircraft carriers (CV).<ref>CVL--Small Aircraft Carriers, [[Naval Historical Center]], http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/cvl-no.htm, accessed 22 September 2006.</ref>  

The British Royal Navy made a similar design which served both them and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries after World War II. One of these carriers, India's [[INS Viraat|INS ''Viraat'']], formerly [[HMS Hermes (R12)|HMS ''Hermes'']], is still being used.

===Escort Carriers and Merchant Aircraft Carriers===
To protect Atlantic [[convoy]]s, the British developed what they called [[Merchant Aircraft Carrier]]s, which were merchant ships equipped with a flat deck for half a dozen aircraft. These operated with civilian crews, under merchant colors, and carried their normal cargo besides providing air support for the convoy. As there was no lift or hangar, aircraft maintenance was limited and the aircraft spent the entire trip sitting on the deck.

These served as stop-gap until dedicated [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] could be built in the US (US classification ''CVE''). About a third of the size of a fleet carrier, it carried about two dozen aircraft for anti-submarine duties. Over one hundred were built or converted from merchantmen.

Escort carriers were built in the US from two basic hull designs: one from a merchant ship, and the other from a slightly larger, slightly faster tanker. Besides defending convoys, these were used to transport aircraft across the ocean. Nevertheless, some participated in the battles to liberate the [[Philippines]], notably the [[Battle off Samar]] in which six escort carriers and their escorting destroyers briefly took on five Japanese battleships and bluffed them into retreating.

===Catapult Aircraft Merchantmen===
As an emergency stop-gap before sufficient merchant aircraft carriers became available, the British provided air cover for convoys using ''Catapult aircraft merchantman'' (CAM ships) and [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s. CAM ships were merchant vessels equipped with an aircraft, usually a battle-weary [[Hawker Hurricane]], launched by a catapult. Once launched, the aircraft could not land back on the deck and had to ditch in the sea if it was not within range of land. Over two years, fewer than 10 launches were ever made, yet these flights did have some success: 6 bombers for the loss of a single pilot.

==Post-war developments==
[[Image:USS_Essex_(CV-9)_-_January_1960.jpg|right|thumb|[[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS ''Essex'']] in heavy seas with a post-World War II angled deck.]]
Three major post-war developments came from the need to improve operations of jet-powered aircraft, which had higher weights and landing speeds than their propeller-powered forebearers.
The first jets were tested as early as [[3 December]] [[1945]]; a [[de Havilland Vampire]] and jets were operating by the early 1950s from carriers. 

===Angled decks===
During the Second World War, aircraft would land on the flight deck parallel to the long axis of the ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. Aircraft which had already landed would be parked on the deck at the bow end of the flight deck. A crash barrier was raised behind them to stop any landing aircraft which overshot the landing area because its landing hook missed the arrestor cables. If this happened, it would often cause serious damage or injury and even, if the crash barrier was not strong enough, destruction of parked aircraft.

[[Image:F-14D Tomcat on USS John C. Stennis.jpg|right|thumb|An F-14D Tomcat sits poised for launch on one of four steam-powered catapults aboard the nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS ''John C. Stennis''.]]
[[Image:FS CdG Optics.jpg|thumb|Landing optics of ''[[FS Charles de Gaulle|Charles de Gaulle]]'']]
An important development of the early 1950s was the British invention of the angled deck, where the runway was canted at an angle of a few degrees across the ship. If an aircraft misses the arrestor cables, the pilot only needs to increase [[engine]] power to maximum to get airborne again and will not hit the parked aircraft because the angled deck points out over the sea. The [[USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74)|USS ''John C. Stennis'']] is an example of an aircraft carrier that utilizes the concept of an angled landing deck.

===Steam catapults===
The modern [[Aircraft catapult|steam-powered catapult]], powered by steam from the ship's [[boiler]]s or reactors, was invented by Commander C.C. Mitchell [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]]. It was widely adopted following trials on [[HMS Perseus (R51)|HMS ''Perseus'']] between 1950 and 1952 which showed it to be more powerful and reliable than the compressed air catapults which had been introduced in the 1930s.

===Landing systems===
Another British invention was the glide-slope indicator (also known as a "meatball"). This was a gyroscopically-controlled lamp (which used a [[Fresnel lens]]) on the port side of the deck which could be seen by the aviator who was about to land, indicating to him whether he was too high or too low in relation to the desired glidepath. It also took into account the effect of the waves on the flight deck. The device became a necessity as the landing speed of aircraft increased.

===Nuclear age===
The US Navy attempted to become a strategic nuclear force in parallel with the U.S.A.F long range bombers with the project to build [[USS United States (CVA-58)|''United States'']], which was termed CVA, with the "A" signifying "atomic". This ship would have carried long range twin-engine bombers, each of which could carry an atomic bomb. The project was cancelled under pressure from the newly-created [[United States Air Force]], and the letter "A" was re-cycled to mean "attack." But this only delayed the growth of carriers. ([[Nuclear weapon]]s would be part of the carrier weapons load despite Air Force objections beginning in 1955 aboard [[USS Forrestal (CV-59)|USS ''Forrestal'']], and by the end of the fifties the Navy had a series of nuclear-armed attack aircraft.) (see [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)#Early career]])

The US Navy also built the first aircraft carrier to be powered by nuclear reactors. [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']] was powered by eight nuclear reactors and was the second warship (after [[USS Long Beach]]) to be powered in this way. Subsequent supercarriers starting with USS Nimitz took advantage of this technology to increase their endurance utilizing only two reactors. The only other nation to have followed the US lead is France with [[FS Charles de Gaulle|''Charles de Gaulle'']] although nuclear power is used for submarine propulsion by France, Great Britain and the former Soviet Union.

===Helicopters===
The post-war years also saw the development of the helicopter, with a variety of useful roles and mission capability aboard aircraft carriers. Whereas fixed-wing aircraft are suited to air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack, helicopters are used to transport equipment and personnel and can be used in an [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) role with dipping sonar and torpedoes as well as anti-surface vessel warfare, with missiles.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the UK and the U.S. converted some of their older carriers into Commando Carriers; sea-going helicopter airfields like [[HMS Bulwark (R08)|HMS ''Bulwark'']]. To mitigate against the expensive connotations of the term "aircraft carrier", the new [[Invincible class aircraft carriers|''Invincible'' class]] carriers were originally designated "through deck cruisers" and were initially helicopter-only craft to operate as escort carriers. The arrival of the Sea Harrier [[VTOL]]/[[STOVL]] jet meant they could carry fixed-wing aircraft, despite their short flight deck. The U.S. used conventional carriers initially as pure ASW carriers embarking helicopters and fixed-wing ASW aircraft like the [[S-2]] Tracker. Later, specialized [[LPH]] carriers for the transport of [[United States Marine Corps]] troops and their helicopter transports were developed. These were eveloved into the [[LHA]] and later into the [[LHD]] class amphibious carriers, similar to the UK model even to the point of embarking [[Harrier]] aircraft.

==Post-Second World War conflicts==
===UN carrier operations in the Korean War===
The United Nations command began carrier operations against the [[North Korean Army]] on [[July 3]], [[1950]] in response to the invasion of [[South Korea]]. [[Task Force 77]] consisted at that time of the carriers [[USS Valley Forge (CV-45)|USS ''Valley Forge'']] and [[HMS Triumph|HMS ''Triumph'']]. Before the armistice of [[July 27]], [[1953]], 12 U.S. carriers served 27 tours in the [[Sea of Japan]] as part of the Task Force 77. During periods of intensive air operations as many as four carriers were on the line at the same time (see [[Attack on the Sui-ho Dam]]), but the norm was two on the line with a third "ready" carrier at [[Yokosuka]] able to respond to the Sea of Japan at short notice.

A second carrier unit, Task Force 95, served as a blockade force in the [[Yellow Sea]] off the west coast of North Korea. The task force consisted of a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] light carrier ([[HMS]]s [[HMS Triumph (R16)|''Triumph'']], [[HMS Theseus (R64)|''Theseus'']], [[HMS Glory (R62)|''Glory'']], [[HMS Ocean (R68)|''Ocean'']], and ''[[HMAS Sydney (1944)|HMAS ''Sydney'']])'' and usually a U.S. escort carrier ([[USS]] [[USS Badoeng Strait|''Badoeng Strait'']], [[USS Bairoko|''Bairoko'']], [[USS Point Cruz|''Point Cruz'']], [[USS Rendova|''Rendova'']], and [[USS Sicily|''Sicily'']]).

Over 301,000 carrier strikes were flown during the Korean War: 255,545 by the aircraft of Task Force 77; 25,400 by the Commonwealth aircraft of Task Force 95, and 20,375 by the escort carriers of Task Force 95. United States Navy and Marine Corps carrier-based combat losses were 541 aircraft. The [[Fleet Air Arm]] lost 86 aircraft in combat, and the [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]] of Australia 15.

===U.S. carrier operations in Southeast Asia===
The United States Navy fought "the most protracted, bitter, and costly war" (René Francillon) in the history of naval aviation from [[August 2]], [[1964]] to [[August 15]], [[1973]] in the waters of the [[South China Sea]]. Operating from two deployment points ([[Yankee Station]] and [[Dixie Station]]), carrier aircraft supported combat operations in [[South Vietnam]] and conducted bombing operations in conjunction with the [[U.S. Air Force]] in [[North Vietnam]] under [[Operation Flaming Dart|Operations Flaming Dart]], [[Operation Rolling Thunder|Rolling Thunder]], and [[Operation Linebacker|Linebacker]]. The number of carriers on the line varied during differing points of the conflict, but as many as six operated at one time during [[Operation Linebacker]].

Twenty-one aircraft carriers (all operational attack carriers during the era except [[USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)|''John F. Kennedy'']]) deployed to [[Task Force 77]] of the U.S. [[Seventh Fleet]], conducting 86 war cruises and operating 9,178 total days on the line in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. Five hundred thirty aircraft were lost in combat and 329 more in operational accidents, causing the deaths of 377 naval aviators, with 64 others reported missing and 179 taken [[prisoner-of-war]]. Two hundred five officers and men of the ship's complements of three carriers ([[USS Forrestal|''Forrestal'']], [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|''Enterprise'']], and [[USS Oriskany|''Oriskany'']]) were killed in major shipboard fires.

===Falklands War===
[[Image:HMS Hermes (R12) (Royal Navy aircraft carrier.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Hermes'' returning home]] 
During the [[Falklands War]] the United Kingdom was able to win a conflict 8,000&nbsp;miles (13,000&nbsp;km) from home in large part due to the use of the full size carrier HMS ''Hermes'' and the smaller [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']]. The Falklands showed the value of a [[VSTOL]] aircraft &mdash; the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] (the RN Sea Harrier and press-ganged RAF Harriers) in defending the fleet and assault force from shore based aircraft and for attacking the enemy. Helicopters from the carriers were used to deploy troops and pick up the wounded.

===Operations in the Gulf===
The US has also made use of carriers in the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Afghanistan]] and to protect its interests in the Pacific. During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] US aircraft carriers served as the primary base of US air power. Even without the ability to place significant numbers of aircraft in Middle Eastern airbases, the United States was capable of carrying out significant air attacks from carrier-based squadrons. Recently, US aircraft carriers, such as the USS ''Ronald Reagan'' provided air support for counter-insurgency operations in Iraq.

==Aircraft carriers today==
[[Image:Fleet 5 nations.jpg|thumb|Four modern aircraft carriers of various types – [[USS John C. Stennis| USS ''John C. Stennis'']], [[FS Charles de Gaulle|''Charles de Gaulle'']], [[HMS Ocean (L12)|HMS ''Ocean'']] and [[USS John F. Kennedy|USS ''John F. Kennedy'']] — and escort vessels on operations in 2002]]

Aircraft carriers are generally the largest ships operated by [[Navy|navies]]; a [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'']] class carrier powered by two [[nuclear reactor]]s and four [[steam turbine]]s is 1092&nbsp;feet (333&nbsp;m) long and costs about $4.5 billion. The United States has the majority of aircraft carriers with a dozen in service and a dozen in reserve, and its aircraft carriers are a cornerstone of American power projection capability.

Nine countries maintain [[List of aircraft carriers in service|a total of 25]] aircraft carriers: [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[Italy]], [[India]], [[Spain]], [[Brazil]], and [[Thailand]]. In addition the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] possesses the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft carrier [[Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag|''Varyag'']], but most naval analysts believe that they have no intention to operate it, but instead are using ''Varyag'' to learn about carrier operations for future Chinese aircraft carriers. [[Canada]], the People's Republic of China, [[Japan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[Singapore]] and [[France]] also operate vessels capable of carrying and operating multiple helicopters.

Aircraft carriers are generally accompanied by a number of other ships, to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. This is often termed a battle group or carrier group, sometimes a [[carrier battle group]].

In the early 21st century, worldwide aircraft carriers are capable of carrying about 1250 aircraft. US carriers account for over 1000 of these. The United Kingdom and France are both undergoing a major expansion in carrier capability (with a [[Royal Navy CVF programme|common ship class]]), but the United States will still maintain a very large lead.

==Future aircraft carriers==

Several nations which currently possess aircraft carriers are in the process of planning new classes to replace current ones. The world's navies still generally see the aircraft carrier as the main future capital ship, with developments such as the [[arsenal ship]], which have been promoted as an alternative, seen as too limited in terms of flexibility.

Military experts such as [[John Keegan]] in the closing of ''[[The Price of Admiralty]]'' as well as others<ref>[http://www.combatreform2.com/submarineaircraftcarriers.htm Submarine aircraft carriers] (uneven-quality private website, but has third-party citations in support)</ref> have noted that in any future naval conflict between reasonably evenly matched powers, all surface ships - including aircraft carriers - would be at extreme and disproportionate risk, mainly due to the advanced capabilities of satellite recon and anti-ship missiles. Contrary to the thrust of most current naval spending, Keegan therefore postulates that eventually, most navies will move to [[submarine]]s as their main fighting ships, including in roles where submarines play only a minor or no role at the moment.

===British Royal Navy===
[[Image:2006 CVF STOVL.jpg|thumb|Royal Navy ''Future Carrier (CVF)'']]
The [[Royal Navy]] is currently planning two new larger STOVL aircraft carriers (as yet only known as [[Royal Navy CVF programme|CVF]]) to replace the three [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class]] carriers currently in service. These two ships are expected to be named [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (CVF)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] and [[HMS Prince of Wales (CVF)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']].<ref name="pike_cvf">"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/cvf.htm ''Queen Elizabeth'' class Future Aircraft Carrier CVF (002)]." Pike, J. [[GlobalSecurity.org]].</ref> They will be able to operate about 50 aircraft and will have a displacement of around 60,000&nbsp;tonnes. The two ships are due to enter service in 2012 and 2015 respectively. Their primary aircraft complement will be made up of [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35B Lightning II]]s, and their ship's company will number around 1000.

The two ships will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. Initially to be configured for STOVL operations, the carriers are to be adaptable to allow any type of future generation of aircraft to operate from them.

===Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy===
In June 2005, it was reported by boxun.com that the [[People's Republic of China]] would build a US$362 million aircraft carrier with a displacement of 78,000&nbsp;tonnes, to be built by the enclosed Jiangnan Shipyard in [[Shanghai]]. The ship is supposed to carry around seventy 4th- generation jet aircraft (it may carry 5th-generation jet aircraft when available) The report was denied by Chinese defence official ''Zhang Guangqin''.<ref>[http://english.www.gov.tw/index.jsp?action=cna&cnaid=11087 CNA report]</ref> Previous talks to purchase an aircraft carrier from Russia and France have not borne fruit. On March 10, 2006, [[People's Liberation Army]] Lt. Gen. [[Wang Zhiyuan]] announced that the People's Republic of China will research and build an aircraft carrier to develop a CVBG in 3 to 5 years.<ref>[http://www.marinetimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1590111.php Report: China plans to build carrier], 2006 March 10, Marine Corps Times.</ref> Observers say the first carrier would be deployed to secure energy supply lines in the [[South China Sea]]. Fighters included on the carrier may include the J-10B and a modified SU-30MKK.

===French ''Marine Nationale''===
[[Image:Gaule96.jpg|thumb|''Charles De Gaulle'', France's sole nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.]]
The [[French Navy]] has set in motion plans for a [[Future French aircraft carrier|second CTOL aircraft carrier]], to supplement ''[[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|Charles de Gaulle]]''. The design is to be much larger, in the range of 65-74,000 tonnes, and will not be nuclear-powered like Charles de Gaulle. There are plans to buy the third carrier of the current [[Royal Navy CVF programme|Royal Navy design]] for [[CATOBAR]] operations (the [[Thales Group|Thales]]/[[BAE Systems]] design for the Royal Navy is for a STOVL carrier which is reconfigurable to CATOBAR operations).

===Indian Navy===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Gorshkov-01-model.jpg|right|thumb|A model of [[Admiral Gorshkov]] after reconfiguration.]] -->
[[India]] started the construction of a 37,500&nbsp;tonne, 252&nbsp;meter-long [[Vikrant class aircraft carrier|''Vikrant'' class aircraft carrier]] in April 2005. The new carrier will cost US$762 million and will operate [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG 29K 'Fulcrum']], Naval [[HAL LCA]] and Sea Harrier aircraft along with the Indian-made helicopter [[HAL Dhruv]]. The ship will be powered by four turbine engines and when completed will have a range of 7,500&nbsp;nautical miles (14,000&nbsp;km), carrying 160 officers, 1400 sailors, and 30 aircraft. The carrier is being constructed by a state-run shipyard in southern India.

In 2004, India also bought [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov|''Admiral Gorshkov'']] from [[Russia]] for US$1.5 billion. It is most likely to be named the [[INS Vikramaditya]], and is expected to join the [[Indian Navy]] in 2008 after a refit.<ref>[http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/12/content_433517.htm Article on India's indigenously built aircraft carrier.]</ref>

===Italian ''Marina Militare''===
The construction of the conventional powered ''[[Marina Militare]]'' STOVL aircraft carrier [[Cavour (550)|''Cavour'']] began in 2001. It is being built by [[Fincantieri]] of Italy. After much delay, ''Cavour'' is expected to enter service in 2008 to complement the Marina Militare aircraft carrier [[Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']]. A second aircraft carrier in the 25-30,000&nbsp;tonne range is much desired by the Italian Navy, to replace the already decommissioned helicopter carrier [[Italian aircraft carrier Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']], but for budgetary reasons all further development is on hold. It is provisionally called [[Alcide de Gasperi]].

===Royal Australian Navy===
The Royal Australian Navy is currently investing in two [[Canberra class large amphibious ship]]s, which will either be the French [[Mistral class landing platform dock|''Mistral'' class]] or the Spanish [[Buque de Proyección Estratégica|''Buque de Proyección Estratégica'']] design. While the Navy has not considered operating fixed-wing aircraft from the ships, it has been suggested by commentators that they also operate aircraft such as the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35B]]. Both to be in service by 2012.

===Russian Navy===
[[Image:Russian aircraft carrier Kuznetsov.jpg.jpg|thumb|right|The Russian ski-jump-equipped ''Admiral Kuznetsov''.]]
The [[Russia]]n navy has one operational aircraft carrier, [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']].

Russia is currently developing a new aircraft carrier design. They are starting from scratch to make a modern model{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, with the newest available materials and electronics. Requirements would be for two aircraft carriers - one each for the Russian Northern and Pacific Fleets. Construction is set to begin by 2010, and finish in around 6 years. The [[Soviet aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk|''Ulyanovsk'' supercarrier]] design is being revised.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Spanish Navy===
[[Image:buqueproyeccionestrategica.jpg|thumb|right|Spanish ''Buque de proyección estratégica'']]
The project for the 231&nbsp;meter-long and 25,000-30,000&nbsp;tonnes conventional powered ''[[Buque de Proyección Estratégica]]'' (Strategic projection vessel) for the Spanish navy was approved in 2003, and its construction started in August 2005, with the ship-building firm [[Navantia]] in charge of the project. The ''Buque de proyección estratégica'' is a vessel designed to operate both as [[amphibious assault]] vessel and as VSTOL aircraft carrier, depending on the mission assigned. The design was made keeping in mind the low-intensity conflicts in which the Spanish Armada is likely to be involved in the future. When it is configured to operate as VSTOL aircraft carrier, the operating range will be about 25,000&nbsp;tonnes, and it will operate a maximum of 30 [[AV-8B Harrier II|Matador AV-8B+]], F-35 or a mixed force of both aircraft. The ship is provided with a Ski-Jump and a tri-dimensional radar based combat system, and she will be the second operating aircraft carrier of the Spanish navy after [[Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias|''Príncipe de Asturias'']].

===US Navy===
[[Image:CVN-21.jpg|thumb|right|US Navy ''Gerald R. Ford'' class (formerly CVN-21)]]
The current US Fleet of [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'' class]] carriers are to be followed into service (and in some cases replaced) by the [[Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier|''Gerald R. Ford'' (CVN-78) class]]. It is expected that the ships will be larger than the [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)|''Nimitz'']], and will also be designed to be less detectable by radar. The United States Navy is also looking to make these new carriers more automated in an effort to reduce the amount of funding required to build and maintain its [[supercarrier]]s.
