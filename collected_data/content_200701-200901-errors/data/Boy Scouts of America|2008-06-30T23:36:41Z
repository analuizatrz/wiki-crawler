The '''Boy Scouts of America''' ('''BSA''') is the largest [[List of youth organizations|youth organization]] in the [[United States]] with over five million members in various age-related divisions. More than 110&nbsp;million Americans have been members of the BSA in some 125,000&nbsp;units nationwide since it was founded in 1910 as part of the international development of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]].<ref name="honor">{{cite book |last=Townley |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Townley |url=http://www.legacyofhonor.com/|title=Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts |publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|year=2007 |isbn=0-312-36653-1 |accessdate=2008-06-22 |page= 12}}</ref>

The BSA seeks to train youth in responsible [[citizenship]], character development, and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of [[Wilderness|outdoor]] activities, educational programs, and, at older age levels, career&ndash;oriented programs in partnership with community organizations. For younger members, the [[Scout method]] is used to inculcate typical Scouting values such as [[self-esteem]], personal [[Honour|honor]], citizenship and outdoors skills through a variety of activities such as [[camping]], [[List of water sports|aquatics]] and [[hiking]].<ref name="vision">{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Legal/mission.aspx |title=Mission Statement and Vision Statement |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref><ref name="mbcom">{{cite web |url=http://www.meritbadge.com/info/aims.htm |title=Boy Scout Aims and Methods |publisher=Meritbadge.com |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

The BSA is a constituent member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]].  The traditional Scouting divisions are ''Cub Scouting'' for boys ages 7&ndash;10, ''Boy Scouting'' for boys ages 10&ndash;17 and ''Venturing'' for young men and women ages 14&ndash;21.  [[Learning for Life]] is a non-traditional subsidiary that provides in-school and career education.<ref name="2006YIR"/><ref name="grolier">{{cite web |url=http://nbk.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=a2003470-h |title=Boy Scouts |work=The New Book of Knowledge |publisher=Grolier Online |accessdate=2008-02-24}} (registration required)</ref>  The BSA operates traditional Scouting locally through units sponsored and operated by churches, clubs, civic associations, educational organizations and the like. Units are led entirely by volunteers, supported by local councils using both paid professionals and volunteers.

The influence of Scouting on American society is frequently cited by both its advocates and critics. In addition to nostalgic memories of [[campfire]]s kindling friendships, prominent leaders in various fields of endeavor have credited the skills they learned in Scouting as helping mold them into successful citizens. Critics have called the BSA's membership restrictions pertaining to avowed [[Atheism|atheists]] and [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] unjustly discriminatory, resulting in litigation in various [[state court|state]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]].

==Origins==
{{main|Scouting in the United States|History of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]] in the United States was at its height during the early twentieth century. With the migration of families from rural to urban centers, there were concerns among some people that young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism. The [[YMCA]] was an early promoter of [[Social welfare provision|social welfare]] and other reforms involving young men. [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] started [[Scouting]] in 1907 in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Social movement|movement]] began to grow overseas.<ref name="NT">{{cite journal|last=Beardsall |first=Jonny|date=2007|title=Dib, dib, dib... One Hundred Years of Scouts at Brownsea|journal=The National Trust Magazine|publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]|issue=Spring 2007|pages=525-55}}</ref> In 1909, Chicago publisher [[William D. Boyce|W. D. Boyce]] was visiting [[London]], [[England]] where he met the [[Unknown Scout]] and learned of the Scouting movement.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Robert |year=2001 |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0110/d-wwas.html |title=The Man Who Got Lost in the Fog |journal=[[Scouting (magazine)|Scouting]] |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> Soon after his return to the U.S., Boyce incorporated the Boy Scouts of America on [[February 8]], [[1910]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rowan |first=Edward L |year=2005 |title=To Do My Best: James E. West and the History of the Boy Scouts of America |publisher=Las Vegas International Scouting Museum |isbn=0-9746479-1-8 }}</ref> [[Edgar M. Robinson]]  and Lee F. Hanmer became interested in the nascent BSA movement and convinced Boyce to turn the program over to the [[YMCA]] for development.  Robinson enlisted [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], [[Daniel Carter Beard]] and other prominent leaders in the early youth movements. Robinson then turned the movement over to [[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]] who became the first [[Chief Scout Executive]] and the Scouting movement began to expand in the U.S.<ref>{{cite book |author=Macleod, David L. |title=Building Character in the American Boy: The Boy Scouts, YMCA and Their Forerunners, 1870–1920 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | date=1983 |isbn=0-299-09400-6 }}</ref>

The BSA's stated purpose at its incorporation in 1910 was "...to teach [boys] patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values...".<ref name="honor"/>{{rp|7}} Later, in 1937, [[Chief Scout Executive|deputy Chief Scout Executive]] [[George J. Fisher]] expressed the BSA's mission, "Each generation as it comes to maturity has no more important duty than that of teaching high ideals and proper behavior to the generation which follows".<ref name=Jambo37>{{cite book|title=The National and World Jamborees in Pictures|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|location=New York|year=1937|page=p. 131}}</ref>

==Membership==
===Traditional membership===
[[Image:VarsityScoutspreparingtoheadoutbackpacking2004.jpg|right|thumb|[[Varsity Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Varsity Scouts]] preparing to go [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]]]]
In the BSA, Scouting is considered to be one movement with three main membership divisions:
*'''[[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]]''' is the largest of the three divisions, available to boys from first&ndash;grade through fifth&ndash;grade or seven through ten years old and their families. It uses a challenging system to pursue the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.<ref name="vision"/> Cub Scouting is divided into age-based levels of Tiger Cubs, Wolf Cubs, Bear Cubs, and Webelos Scouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/advance/cubscout/intro.asp|title=Cub Scout Advancement|work=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]]|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>
*'''[[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]]''' is the [[wikt:flagship|flagship]] division of the BSA for boys ages ten to eighteen. It uses a system of outdoor activities to achieve the aims of Scouting. '''[[Varsity Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Varsity Scouting]]''' is modified Boy Scouting available to boys from fourteen through seventeen that adds a system of [[high adventure]] and sporting activities to appeal to the older boy, with an emphasis on team competition. The '''[[Order of the Arrow]]''' (OA) is the Boy Scout national honor society for experienced campers, based on [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]<!--- American Indian is the preferred usage by the BSA. Read the linked article for a thorough discussion.---> traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service and brotherhood.
*'''[[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]''' is the division for young men and women ages fourteen through twenty-one.<ref name="28-406">{{cite book|url=http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/28-406.pdf |title=Boy Scouts of America Youth Application |id=#28-406B |accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |quote=Venturers and Sea Scouts registered in a crew or ship prior to their 21st birthday may continue as members after their 21st birthday until the crew or ship recharters or until they reach their 22nd birthday, whichever comes first.}}</ref> Its purpose is to provide positive experiences to help youth mature and to prepare them to become responsible adults.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-388.aspx |title=What is Venturing |work=Fact Sheet |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> '''[[Sea Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]]''' is the nautical oriented part of this division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seascout.org/|title=Sea Scouts, BSA|work=Sea Scouts, BSA|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

There are about 100,000 physically or mentally disabled Scouts throughout the United States. Anyone certified as disabled "may enroll in Scouting and remain in its program beyond the regulation age limits. This provision allows all members to advance in Scouting as far as they wish."<ref name="grolier">&nbsp;</ref> Advancement is measured by the achievement to the best of the Scout's abilities.

===Membership controversies===
{{details|Boy Scouts of America membership controversies}}
The Boy Scouts of America has been both criticized and supported for its membership policy, which prohibits participation by [[Atheism|atheists]] or agnostics. "Known or avowed" [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] are not permitted to be [[Scout Leader]]s, and participation by girls is limited to the Venturing and Learning For Life programs (although women are permitted to be Scout leaders).<ref name="core">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalegal.org/core-values-286.asp |work=BSALegal.org |title=Core Values |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref><ref name="duty">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp |work=BSALegal.org |title=Duty to God |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/b/a/258300.htm |last=Cline |first=Austin |title=Boy Scouts & Public Funding: Defending Bigotry as a Public Good |work=About.com |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/ |work=BSA Discrimination |title=Discrimination in the BSA |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> The BSA contends that these policies are essential in its mission to instill in young people the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of the Scout Oath and Law.<ref name="core"/><ref name="duty"/> The organization's legal right to have these policies has been upheld repeatedly by both [[state court|state]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. In recent years, these membership policies have led to litigation over the terms under which the BSA can access governmental resources including public lands.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=Mark|date=2006-10-16|title=Supreme Court will not Review Berkeley Sea Scouts' Case|journal=San Francisco Chronicle via Associated Press|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/10/16/state/n075532D70.DTL|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

===Learning for Life===
[[Image:Learning for Life.svg|thumb|Learning for Life]]
[[Learning for Life]] is a school and work-site based program that is a subsidiary of the BSA. It utilizes programs designed for schools and community-based organizations that are designed to prepare youth to for the complexities of contemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence, motivation, and self-esteem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/ |title=Learning for Life - Exploring |publisher=Learning For Life |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> [[Exploring (Learning for Life)|Exploring]] is the worksite-based program of Learning for Life with programs based on five areas of emphasis: career opportunities, life skills, citizenship, character education, and leadership experience.<ref name="lfl outside">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/lfl.html |title=Learning For Life |publisher=BSA Discrimination |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

Learning for Life is not considered a traditional [[Scouting]] program; it does not use the [[Scout Promise]], [[Scout Law]], uniforms, or insignia of traditional Scouting. All Learning for Life programs are open to youth and adults without restriction based on gender, residence, sexual orientation, or other considerations other than age requirements.<ref name="lfl outside"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/exploring/promos/99-993.pdf |title=What Is Exploring? |publisher=Learning For Life |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

==Aims, methods, and ideals==
[[Image:BSA 2006-2010 Strategic Plan.png|150px|thumb|BSA "Strategic Plan Identity" emblem]]
The stated objectives of the BSA are referred to as ''Aims of Scouting'': character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. The BSA pursues these aims through an informal education system called the [[Scout method]], with variations that are designed to be appropriate for the age and maturity of each membership division:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usscouts.org/usscouts/aboutbsa/vision.asp |title=BSA Vision Statement |work=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]] |accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref><ref name="ldrtrng">{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/BoyScouts/NewLeaderTraining/basic.aspx |title=Basic Leader Training |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref>
* The methods of [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]] are ideals, the den, advancement, family involvement, activities, home- and neighborhood-centered, and the uniform.
* The methods of [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]] are ideals, patrols, the outdoor program, advancement, association with adults, personal growth, leadership development, and the uniform.
* The methods of [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]] are leadership, group activities, adult association, recognition, ideals, high adventure, and teaching others.

[[:Category:Scouting ideals|Scouting ideals]] are codified for each membership division and include the Cub Scout Promise and the Law of the Pack, the [[Scout Promise|Scout Oath]] and the [[Scout Law]] and the Venturing Oath and Venturing Code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/advance/cubscout/cspromiselaw.asp|title=The Cub Scout Promise The Law of the Pack and The Cub Scout Motto|date=2007-08-05|work=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]]|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsoathlaw.asp|title=Boy Scout Oath, Law, Motto and Slogan and the Outdoor Code|date=2007-08-05|work=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]]|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/venturing/WordDocs/WhatIsVenturingFact.doc |format=doc |title=What is Venturing|work=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]]|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

==Organization==
===National Council=== 
The National Council is the corporate membership of the Boy Scouts of America and is [[Congressional charter|chartered]] by the [[United States Congress]] to operate the Scouting program. The National Council members include the elected National Executive Board, the regional executive committees, the local council representatives, members at large, and honorary members. The National program is directed by the National Executive Board and administered by the [[Chief Scout Executive]] using a staff of professional Scouters. The National Council is incorporated as a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] [[Non-profit organization]] and is funded from private donations, membership dues, corporate sponsors, and special events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://charityreports.bbb.org/public/Report.aspx?CharityID=1120&bureauID=9999|title= BBB Wise Giving Report for Boy Scouts of America |date=March 2008|work=[[Better Business Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

The BSA was granted a federal charter in 1916, now codified as 36 U.S.C. Chapter 309,<ref>{{usctc|36|309|}} Federal charter, Boy Scouts of America</ref> stating that their purpose is to:
<blockquote>"promote, through organization, and cooperation with other agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and others, to train them in scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods that were in common use by boy scouts on June 15, 1916."</blockquote>

The charter authorized and set standards for the incorporation of the Boy Scouts of America. A provision in the federal charter gives the BSA the "exclusive right to use emblems, badges, descriptive or designating marks, and words or phrases" that they adopt.

The BSA is governed by the National Executive Board and directed by the [[national president of the Boy Scouts of America|national president]], elected by representatives from the local councils.<ref name="bsaorg">{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Bill |url=http://usscouts.org/aboutbsa/bsaorg.asp| title=Organization of the Boy Scouts of America |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-03-12}}</ref> Board memberships include regular elected members, presidents, the Advisory Council chair, and the chairman of the Board of Regents of the [[National Eagle Scout Association]]. The board may also include up to five appointed youth members. Professional Scouters of the National staff are nonvoting members.

The National Executive Board has five group standing committees: the Administration Group Committee, Program Group Committee, Human Resources Group Committee, Regional Presidents' Group Committee, and Relationships/Marketing Group Committee. Each of these committees is in turn directly responsible for a corresponding support group that provides administrative functions. Group committees may in turn be responsible for support standing committees and groups divided into divisions.

===Groups and divisions===
The Program Group is responsible for delivering the Scouting program and includes the Boy Scouting, Cub Scouting, and Venturing Divisions. The Scoutreach Division emphasizes service to rural and urban areas and to minority populations. The African American Focus works with African American populations in partnerships with the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], African American Baptist churches, and other groups. The Hispanic/Latino Focus includes the ¡Scouting – Vale La Pena! emphasis for Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutreachbsa.org/ |title=Scoutreach Division&ndash; BSA |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutingvalelapena.org/ |title=Scouting - Vale La Pena |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref> This includes Spanish language resources such as handbooks, training material, and videos. The Soccer and Scouting emphasis is a partnership with the [[National Soccer Coaches Association of America]] to provide alternatives for Cub Scout age Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerandscouting.org/index.html |title=Soccer and Scouting |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> The Asian American Focus reaches out to Indo-Chinese American, Vietnamese American, Chinese American, and Korean American communities.

The National Supply Group is responsible for developing and selling uniforms, apparel, insignia, literature, and equipment. It sells equipment and supplies through National Scout Shops, local council trading posts, authorized independent resellers, and online at ScoutStuff.org.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutstuff.org |title=ScoutStuff.org |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref> Supply Group also licenses trademarks for use by other commercial vendors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalicensing.org |title=BSALicensing.org |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>

The Administrative Group comprises several divisions, such as the Finance Support Division, Human Resources Administration Division, Professional Development Division, Compensation and Benefits Division, and Information Services Division that provide internal administrative service and support. The Marketing and Communications Division is part of the Administrative Group and is responsible for marketing the BSA program, which includes responsibility for most national websites. It also publishes two magazines: ''[[Scouting (magazine)|Scouting]]'' for adult leaders and ''[[Boys' Life]]'' for youth.

The National Scouting Museum is located in [[Irving, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsamuseum.org/ |title=National Scouting Museum|publisher=National Scouting Museum |accessdate=2008-03-07}}</ref> Exhibits include [[Norman Rockwell]] paintings, high adventure sections, hands-on learning experiences, interactive exhibits, and a historical collection tracing uniforms, themes, and documents from the beginning of the Scouting movement in America.

===Regions and areas===
{{Infobox Awards |box_width=|halign=center |award1=[[Image:BSA Region Map.svg|200px]] |award2=Boy Scouts of America Regions as of 1992}}
For administrative purposes, the BSA is divided into four regions&mdash;Western, Central, Southern, and Northeast.<ref name="bsaorg"/> Each region is subdivided into areas, about six per region.

Each region has a volunteer president, assisted by volunteer officers and board members, and the day-to-day work of Scouting is managed by the regional director, assistant and associate regional directors, and area directors. Regions and areas are subdivisions of the National Council and do not have a corporate status separate from the BSA.
*Central Region covers all of Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin, and parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Virginia, and West Virginia.
*Northeast Region covers all of Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Puerto Rico, Transatlantic Council, and the Virgin Islands, and parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerbsa.org/ |title=Northeast Region |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>
*Southern Region covers all of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://srbsa.org/ |title=Southern Region |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>
*Western Region covers all of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Far East Council and the Pacific Basin, and parts of Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrbsa.org/ |title=Western Region |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

===Local councils===
{{maincat|Local councils of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The BSA program is administered through 308&nbsp;local councils, with each council covering a geopolitical area that may vary from a single city to an entire state. Councils receive an annual charter from the National Council and are usually incorporated as a charitable organization.<ref name="bsaorg"/>

The council level organization is similar to that of the National Council. The council executive board is headed by the council president and is made up of annually elected local community leaders. The board establishes the council program and carries out the resolutions, policies, and activities of the council. Board members serve without pay and some are volunteer Scouters working at the unit level. Youth members may be selected to the council executive board according to the council by-laws.

The Scout executive manages council operations—including finance, property management, advancement and awards, registrations, and Scout Shop sales—with a staff of other professionals and para-professionals. [[Commissioner Service|Commissioners]] lead the unit service functions of the council, help maintain the standards of the BSA, and assures a healthy unit program.
[[Image:Philly Scout.png|thumb|"The Ideal Scout", a statue by [[R. Tait McKenzie]] in front of the Bruce S. Marks Scout Resource Center in the [[Cradle of Liberty Council]]]]

The BSA charters two councils for Scouts who live overseas, largely on military bases in Europe and Asia. The [[American Scouting overseas#Transatlantic Council|Transatlantic Council]], headquartered in Germany, serves BSA units in much of Europe, and the [[American Scouting overseas#Far East Council|Far East Council]], headquartered in Japan, serves units in the western Pacific areas. The [[American Scouting overseas#Direct Service|Direct Service]] branch makes the Scouting movement available to U.S. citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas. The [[Scouting in Hawaii#Aloha Council|Aloha Council]] in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and in the sovereign countries of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and [[Palau]].

The Greater New York Councils are unique in that they are divided into five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] with each led by a borough Scout executive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa-gnyc.org/openrosters/view_homepage.asp?orgkey=1161 |title=Greater New York Councils|publisher=Greater New York Councils-BSA |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> Each borough is then divided into districts. Boroughs and districts are subdivisions of the local council and do not have a separate corporate status.

Councils are divided into districts with leadership provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the [[Commissioner Service|district commissioner]].<ref name="bsaorg"/> Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers. The voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each chartered organization having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who in turn elect the district chairman.

===Units and chartered organizations===
The unit is the main operating group of the BSA.<ref name="bsaorg"/>
Units use different names for each membership level&mdash;Cub Scouts are organized as packs, Boy Scouts as troops, Varsity Scouts as teams, Venturers as crews, and Sea Scouts as ships.

Each unit is operated by a community-based organization such as a business, service organization, school organization, labor group, or religious institution that has applied for and received an annual charter from the BSA. This chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place, and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the manager of Scouting in a chartered organization and serves as a liaison between the unit, the chartered organization, and the BSA. Chartered organizations use the Scouting program to support the goals and objectives of the organization. As of [[December 31]], [[2007]], the BSA's membership report by chartered organization indicated that approximately 62&nbsp;percent of units are sponsored by religious institutions:

Units are administered by a unit committee appointed by the chartered organization. The unit committee, led by the committee chairman, oversees the unit program and activities and manages record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment, and registration. Each unit is led by a registered and trained leader&mdash;a Cubmaster, Scoutmaster, Coach, Advisor, or Skipper. These leaders, with one or more assistants, are appointed by the unit committee and must be approved by both the chartered organization and the local council.

==Finance==
In 2005, the BSA ranked as the twelfth-largest [[non-profit organization]] in the US, with total revenues of $665.9&nbsp;million.

==Impact on American life==
Scouting and Boy Scouts are well known throughout [[United States|American]] [[Scouting in popular culture|culture]]. The term "Boy Scout" is used to generally describe someone who is earnest and honest, or who helps other cheerfully. Alternately, it can be used as a pejorative, sarcastic term.<ref name="simon">{{cite news| first=Scott |last=Simon | title=Remembering the Boy Scouts | date=2008-06-14 | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91514659 | accessdate=2008-06-14}}</ref>

[[Alvin Townley]] wrote in ''Legacy of Honor'' about the large positive impact of Eagle Scouts in America. Townley cited such examples as how Scouts, especially Eagle Scouts, were disproportionately represented among [[Hurricane Katrina]]'s volunteer relief workers; just as they are disproportionately represented among members of the [[United States Senate]].<ref name="honor"/>{{rp|152}} [[Mark Mays]], [[CEO]] of [[Clear Channel Communications]], told a magazine interviewer in May 2008 that, "Particularly in the very impactful ages of youth 11&nbsp;to&nbsp;14 years old, when they can really go astray and you're taking the time to spend with them and focus on cultural core values like reverent, trustworthy, loyal, and helpful&nbsp;&mdash;all of those different things&nbsp;...&nbsp;Scouting has a huge positive impact on boys and their lives, and that in turn positively impacts our communities and society as a whole".<ref name="MarkMays">{{cite journal|date=May&ndash;June 2008|title=Leading the Way|journal=[[Scouting (magazine)|Scouting]]|pages=33|url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/current/a-leading.html|accessdate=2008-06-22}}</ref> [[Mayor of New York]] and business tycoon [[Michael Bloomberg]], said that the BSA's Scout Law required of all Boy Scouts&nbsp;&mdash; a Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent&nbsp;&mdash; are "all the American values&nbsp;...&nbsp;Americans have quaintly simplistic ways and direct ways of phrasing things&nbsp;...&nbsp;I think it's one of the great strengths of this country".<ref name="honor"/>{{rp|116}}

[[Peter Applebome]], an editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote in 2003 of his experience as an adult participating with his son in Scouting activities, "I feel lucky to have had this unexpected vehicle to share my son's youth, to shape it, and to be shaped by it as well".<ref name="Applebome">{{cite book|last=Applebome|first=Peter|title=Scout's Honor: a father's unlikely foray into the woods|publisher=Harcourt|location=Orlando, FL|authorlink=Peter Applebome |date=2003|pages=325 |isbn=0-15-100592-3}}</ref> He concluded that, although Scouting is viewed by some as old-fashioned, "Scouting's core values&nbsp;...&nbsp;are wonderful building blocks for a movement and a life. Scouting's genuinely egalitarian goals and instincts are more important now than they've ever been. It's one of the only things that kids do that's genuinely cooperative, not competitive."<ref name="Applebome"/>{{rp|319-320}} 

===Good Turns===
From the inception of the Scouting movement, Scouts have been urged to "Do a Good Turn Daily". The first national Good Turn was the promotion of a safe and sane [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] in 1913. Scouting for Food is an on-going annual program begun in 1986 that collects food for local [[food bank]]s.

In 1997, the BSA developed Service to America with a commitment to provide 200 million hours of service by youth members by the end of the year 2000. As part of Service to America, the BSA provided service projects in conjunction with the [[National Park Service]] (NPS). In October 2003, the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] expanded the program with the creation of [[Take Pride in America]], opening service to all Americans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.takepride.gov/index.cfm |title=Take Pride in America |publisher=Department of the Interior |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

The BSA developed Good Turn for America in 2004 to address the problems of hunger, homelessness, and inadequate housing and poor health in conjunction with [[the Salvation Army]], the [[American Red Cross]], [[Habitat for Humanity International|Habitat for Humanity]], and other organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodturnforamerica.org/ |title=Good Turn for America |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>
