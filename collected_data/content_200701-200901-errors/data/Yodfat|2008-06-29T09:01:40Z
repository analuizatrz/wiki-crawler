==History==
===Antiquity===
In 67 CE, Yodfat was the site of a fierce battle described by [[Josephus Flavius]], the commander of the Galilee in the [[Great Revolt]], in his later chronicle of the Jewish wars against the Romans.  The city was guarded by a hilltop fortress accessible only from the north.  [[Vespasian]] pitched his camp on the northern side of the city and held it under siege for 47 days. Vespasian was wounded in the battle. 40,000 Jews were killed and 1,000 women and children were sold into slavery. The city was razed and burned on the first of the Hebrew month of [[Tammuz]]. <ref>http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=571&letter=J</ref>
Josephus himself was taken captive at Yodfat.<ref>http://www.tourism.gov.il/Tourism_Eng/Tourist+Information/Jewish+Themes/Jewish_Sites/Yodfat+jew.htm.</ref>
===After the fall===
After its capture by the Romans, Yodfat was repopulated by refugees from [[Jerusalem]], among them the priestly family of Miyamin <ref> ''Encyclopedia Judaica, ''Joptapata'', Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1978, volume 10, p. 300.</ref> The city is mentioned in the [[Talmud]] as the home of Rabbi Menachem of Jotapata (Zev. 110b). <ref>''Encyclopedia Judaica, ''Joptapata'', Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1978, volume 10, p. 300.</ref>
