The '''Courtauld Institute of Art''' is a self-governing college of the [[University of London]] specialising in the study of the [[history of art]]. The Institute is probably the most prestigious institution for the subject in the world and was awarded a top 5* grade in the most recent Research Assessment Exercise. It was the only History of Art department in the UK to be awarded such a distinction. 

==The Courtauld History==
The Courtauld is celebrating its 75th anniversary during the 2007-8 academic year. It was founded in [[1932]] through the philanthropic efforts of the industrialist and art collector [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], the diplomat and collector [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Lord Lee of Fareham]], and the art historian Sir [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Robert Witt]]. Originally the Courtauld Institute was based in [[Home House]], a [[Robert Adam]]-designed townhouse in Portman Square, [[London]]. Since 1989 it has been based in [[Somerset House]].

The art collection at the Institute was begun by its founder, [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], who presented an extensive collection of mainly [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings in [[1932]], which was enhanced by further gifts in the [[1930s]] and a bequest in [[1948]]. His collection included such masterworks as [[Édouard Manet|Manet's]] ''[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]'' and a version of his ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'', [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir's]] ''La Loge'', landscapes by [[Claude Monet]] and [[Camille Pissarro]], a ballet scene by [[Edgar Degas]] and a group of eight major works by [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. Other paintings include [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh's]] ''Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear'' and ''Cherry Orchard'', [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin's]] ''Nevermore'' and ''Te Rerioa'', as well as important works by [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], [[Henri Rousseau|Henri "Douanier" Rousseau]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]].

Following the death of the eminent art critic [[Roger Fry]] in [[1934]], the Institute received his collection of [[20th-century art]]. Further bequests were added after the [[Second World War]], most notably the collection of [[Old Master]] paintings assembled by Lord Lee. This included [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach's]] ''Adam and Eve'' and a sketch in oils by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] for what is arguably his masterpiece, the ''Deposition'' [[altarpiece]] in [[Antwerp]] Cathedral. Sir Robert Witt was also an outstanding benefactor to the Courtauld and bequeathed his important collection of Old Master and British drawings in [[1952]]. In [[1966]] Mark Gambier-Parry bequeathed the diverse collection of art formed by his grandfather which ranged from [[Early Renaissance painting|Early Italian Renaissance painting]] to [[majolica]], medieval [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[ivory]] carvings and other unusual art forms.

In [[1974]] a group of thirteen watercolours by [[J.M.W. Turner|Turner]] was presented in memory of Sir [[Stephen Courtauld]], famous for restoring [[Eltham Palace]]. In [[1978]] the Courtauld received the Princes Gate Collection of Old Master paintings and drawings formed by Count Antoine Seilern. It includes paintings by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Bruegel]], [[Quentin Matsys]], [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] and rivals the Samuel Courtauld Collection in splendour, being strongest in the works of Rubens.The bequest also included a group of 19th- and 20th-century works by [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], Degas, Renoir and [[Oskar Kokoschka]]. More recently the Lilian Browse and Alastair Hunter collections have given the Courtauld more late 19th- and 20th-century paintings, drawings and sculptures.

The Courtauld Gallery is open to the public and housed in [[Strand, London|The Strand]] Block of Somerset House, which was the first home for the [[Royal Academy]] upon its foundation in [[1768]]. The entrance to 'The Great Room', which housed the annual [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|Summer Exhibition]], has the formidable inscription 'Let no stranger to the [[Muse]]s enter' in [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]].

==The Samuel Courtauld Society==
The Samuel Courtauld Society was launched in 2007 to recognise and bring together some of its most important benefactors.  Annual donors are offered private views of the special exhibitions, unparalleled access to renowned art specialists, and opportunities to meet like-minded philanthropists at events in the UK and the US.  Through these activities, society members build on their own understanding of the visual arts while preserving some of the world’s finest treasures in The Courtauld Gallery. 

==Other study resources==
The Courtauld has two photographic libraries which started as the private collections of two ennobled benefactors: the Conway library, covering [[architecture (built environment)|architecture]], architectural drawings, sculpture and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, named after Lord [[Martin Conway]] and the Witt library, covering paintings, drawings and [[engraving]]s, after Sir Robert Witt. The Book Library is one of the UK's largest archives of art-historical books, periodicals and exhibition catalogues. There is a Slide Library which also covers films, and an IT suite.

An online image collection (www.artandarchitecture.org.uk) of more than 7000 digitised drawings in The Courtauld's collection gives internet users instant access to these materials and to curated groupings of the images based on artist, theme, or historical contexts.  This site was developed with the support of the New Opportunities Fund.
