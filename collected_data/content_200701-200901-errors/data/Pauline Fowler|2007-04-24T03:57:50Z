'''Pauline Fowler''' (née '''Beale''') was a [[fictional character]] in the popular [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. She was played by [[Wendy Richard]].<ref name="gone">"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5165860.stm Wendy Richard to leave EastEnders]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-09-20]].</ref> Pauline was one of the show's original characters, appearing in its first episode on [[19 February]] [[1985]] and remaining on-screen for almost twenty-two years; making her the second longest running character in the show's history, surpassed only by [[Adam Woodyatt]]'s character, [[Ian Beale]]. She made her final appearance on [[25 December]] [[2006]], in an episode that was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers. <ref>{{cite news |title= Vicar of Dibley tops Christmas TV viewing|url= http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=1915232006|publisher= Scotsman |date=[[26 December]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2006-12-27 }}</ref>

Pauline was the matriarchal stalwart of [[Albert Square]]. She had a life of drudgery, money worries and family troubles, but soldiered on through it all with typical stoicism. Fiercely loyal to her family, she was never afraid to speak her mind or defend her views and inherited her acid tongue from her mother, [[Lou Beale|Lou]]. However, the family that she held so dear dwindled in the latter years of her life, perhaps partly due to her overbearing ways.

== Character creation and development ==
Pauline Fowler was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own [[London]] family and background. Pauline was based on one of his cousins, the twin sister to Pete and daughter of Lou; a family set-up that would eventually be recreated on-screen and would go on to be forever hailed as the first family of ''EastEnders'', [[The Fowler/Beale Family|the Beales and Fowlers]].<ref name="insidestory">{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|id=ISBN 0-563-20601-2}}</ref>

Pauline's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''.

:"[[Pete Beale|Pete]]'s twin sister. Forty, and a chip off the [[Lou Beale]] block. Plucky, and determined to battle through whatever the odds. A warm, practical, unsophisticated woman: you stand by your man, do your duty, fight for your kids and have a roast for [[Sunday dinner]]...She's also pregnant...She actually remembers her dad saying ''"Two things we don't discuss in this house are religion and politics".'' She also remembers her dad smoked a pipe, and wishes her husband did too. She loved her dad very much... Maybe she didn't go into her marriage with quite the right spirit? She was due to be chief bridesmaid at her sister's wedding but she'd got [[influenza|the flu]] and was confined to bed. Arthur, someone she'd known from school, was given permission to visit the invalid upstairs. He found himself proposing to her. Years later he said ''"It was to cheer her up really."'' And Pauline found herself accepting too...She's very fond of her twin brother, Pete (and knows that he's mum's favourite). She's very conventional, and the salt of the earth. Jolly, rounded, someone you can get your arms round. She doesn't trust skinny people..." (page 54).<ref name="insidestory"/>

From the beginning, Smith had considered the role would be ideal for the actress [[Wendy Richard]], even though their casting policy was not to use 'stars' and Richard was already a household name in the UK. Up until this time, Richard was known for playing glamorous roles, such as her role in the successful sitcom ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''. Smith initially feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age. She was subsequently offered the role.<ref name="insidestory"/> 

Richard's casting was considered to be a giant leap of faith by Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately 'landed on its feet', because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in the show's history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years. Her baggy woolly cardigan and long-suffering nature have led to her being labelled as a soap institution,<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1044603.stm EastEnder Pauline's Palace date]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-09-20]].</ref> a "soap legend" and a "television icon".<ref name="stage">"[http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/07/a_raven_leaves_the_tower_walford_style.php A raven leaves the tower - Walford style]", ''The Stage''.

Pauline's early memorable storylines included giving birth at the age of 41 to her son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] and coping with the breakdown of her husband [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]], not to mention a plethora of other family problems. Over the years Pauline's character altered somewhat from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the 1980s, she became somewhat of a sombre battleaxe, hardened by a life of misery in [[Albert Square]].<ref>"[http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/eastenders/Eastenders+Pauline+Fowler+to+be+Killed+off+at+Christmas-20368.html Eastenders Pauline Fowler to be Killed off at Christmas]", ''Femalefirst.co.uk''. URL last accessed on [[2006-09-20]].</ref> This change in Pauline's character can perhaps be traced back to the [[adultery|infidelity]] of her husband with lonely divorcée [[Christine Hewitt]] in 1993.<ref name="first10years">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2}}</ref> The audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, but they were generally seen as the most stable of all couples ever featured in the show, so the storyline involving Arthur's extra-marital affair came as a huge shock to viewers. The British press labelled the storyline "The Bonk of the Year" and it finally reached its climax on-screen in September 1993. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would find out about the affair; should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth? In the end it was felt that Arthur should decide to tell her himself, which he did in a shocking episode that saw Pauline turn violent and hit Arthur in the face with a frying pan. This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: the first ten years]]''.<ref name="first10years"/>

The character of Pauline went on to feature in many other memorable storylines including the death of her husband, her son's fatal battle with [[HIV]] and more recently re-marrying after almost a decade alone. 

In July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she would be leaving the show after nearly twenty-two years of service. Richard made the decision to leave when the producers of ''EastEnders'' revealed that Pauline was to re-marry. Wendy thought it would be "disloyal" of Pauline to her beloved first husband Arthur, played by [[Bill Treacher]]. Pauline married [[Joe Macer]] in February 2006 and Richard since commented: "I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong." <ref>"[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006360264,00.html Wendy: Why I quit Enders]", ''The Sun''. URL last accessed on [[2006-09-20]].</ref>

BBC controller of continuing drama [[John Yorke]] has said Richard "occupies a huge place in people's hearts" <ref name="gone"/> and executive producer [[Kate Harwood]] has commented, "For many years Wendy simply was ''EastEnders'' for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the ''EastEnders''' spirit. We thank her for everything she has done for the show and wish her well."<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_content/news_20060711.shtml Original cast member says goodbye]", ''BBC''.

[[Image:Pauline1985.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A heavily pregnant Pauline Fowler as she appeared in July 1985.]]
Although it has been suggested by some that Pauline's presence in ''EastEnders'' was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike.<ref name="soaplife">"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5166062.stm Wendy Richard's dramatic soap life]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-09-20]].</ref> ''[[Inside Soap]]'' editor Steven Murphy has said that the fact Pauline has been such an enduring staple will make it hard for fans to cope with her departure. "It's huge in soap terms... She's a character people love to hate — you just assumed she would be there forever." Jonathan Hughes, editor of ''All About Soap'' magazine, has also said "She's an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of ''EastEnders'' for so many years."<ref name="soaplife"/> 

Despite being popular with many, the character of Pauline has also garnered much criticism over the years. Persistent criticism has been given to the character's dowdy attire, particularly the misconceived perception that she rarely wears anything but a baggy cardigan;<ref name="stage"/> a claim that Wendy Richard herself categorically disputes.<ref>"[http://www.wgazette.com/aut06-beingpauline.html The Importance of Being Pauline]", ''Walford Gazette''. URL last accessed on [[2007-01-03]].</ref> In addition Pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour. She has been described as the "Wicked Witch of Walford"<ref name="times">"[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14936-2518562,00.html Eastenders-Tim Teeman watching BBC One]", ''Times Online''. URL last accessed on [[2007-01-03]].</ref> and "a character who became a byword for downtrodden haggery"."<ref name="guardianculture">"[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/archives/2006/07/11/post_113.html Bye Then Pauline]", ''Guardian''. URL last accessed on [[2007-01-03]].</ref> Lucy Mangan, the culture critic from [[The Guardian]] newspaper, has gone on to sum up the character, commenting: "Pauline Fowler, is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable...She was presumably intended to be the anchoring force for ''EastEnders'', but because of the writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show."<ref name="guardianculture"/> This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35<sup>th</sup> most annoying person of 2006 in a [[BBC Three]] poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list.

The character was killed off in a shocking and dramatic storyline, which aired on Christmas Day 2006. The episode was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers and was the second most highly watched programme of the day.<ref>"[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=424848&in_page_id=1773 BBC1 posts its worst Christmas Day ratings ever]", ''Daily Mail''. URL last accessed on [[2006-09-20]].</ref> Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline brooded in the burnt-out shell of her house while the voices of her (mainly deceased) family echoed like ghosts around her. Her bitter decline culminated in pretending to have a [[brain tumour]] to scupper the revived relationship between her son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] and his ex-wife [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]]. Pauline’s lie was uncovered, Martin and the rest of Albert Square turned against her and Pauline finally collapsed beneath the Square’s Christmas tree following one last row with Sonia, in a storyline that left the rest of Walford in uncertainty about the circumstances of her demise. The repercussions of Pauline's death shook the Square in early 2007, when Pauline's husband Joe was revealed to have dealt the deadly blow to Pauline in a scene not seen on-screen.<ref name="LIFE STYLE EXTRA">"[http://www.lse.co.uk/TVNews.asp?Code=XV36477P&headline=sonia_issued_warrant_for_paulines_murder Sonia issued warrant for Pauline's murder]", ''LIFE STYLE EXTRA''. URL last accessed on [[2007-01-03]].</ref> 

The Christmas Day episodes, written by [[Simon Ashdown]], drew on the show’s early history to mark the occasion of Pauline's exit, which was particularly felt by the use of flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family.<ref name="times"/> The Critic for [[The Times]] online, Tim Teeman, has commented that "Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl."<ref name="times"/> In addition, her parting scene with ''EastEnders'' other long serving "grand dame", [[Dot Branning]] (played by [[June Brown]]), has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: "The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved."<ref name="times"/> Richard herself has been less complimentary about her alter ego's departure and has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's "changing character" and "depressing final storyline". In an interview with the [[The Biography Channel|Biography Channel]] she explained: "I did say, promise me you won’t make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did... I wasn’t too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline’s character... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That’s what [show creator] Julia Smith wanted, and that’s what I felt was right, so I resigned... I think it’s a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now... There was so much history with that family."<ref name="DSdisappointed">"[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds41025.html Richard disappointed by 'Enders exit]", ''Digital Spy''. URL last accessed on [[2007-01-03]].</ref> 

As a final tribute to Pauline and Wendy Richard the BBC aired a special television programme entitled ''EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline'', which provided an emotional look back at Richard's time in Walford, reunited her with prior cast-mates, [[Todd Carty]] and [[James Alexandrou]] (Mark and Martin respectively) and also featured tributes from [[Anna Wing]] and [[Pam St. Clement]] (Lou and [[Pat Evans|Pat]]) among others.<ref name="EErevealed">"[http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/display.var.1097748.0.eastenders_revealed_goodbye_pauline_bbc1.php EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, BBC1]", ''This is Lancashire''.

==Storylines==
Pauline was the youngest daughter of [[Albert Beale|Albert]] and [[Lou Beale]] and the [[twin]] sister of [[Pete Beale|Pete]], who she was extremely close to. She was born and raised in [[Walford]] and lived her entire life at [[list of residences in EastEnders#45 Albert Square|number 45]] [[Albert Square]]; initially with her parents and then her own husband and children.

Pauline got engaged to her husband-to-be, [[Arthur Fowler]], when she was 20 years old. Arthur proposed to her when she was ill in bed with flu on the day she should have been a [[bridesmaid]] at her sister's wedding and they married in September 1965. Within four years she had given birth to two children, eldest son [[Mark Fowler|Mark]], and daughter [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]]. Her third son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] was born later in her life, when she was 41.<ref name="EEHandbook">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|id=ISBN-13: 978-0685529577}}</ref> Pauline worked part-time as a cleaner and also as an assistant at Walford's [[List of buildings in EastEnders#Launderette|Launderette]]; a job she kept right up until her death in 2006. Over the years she has also worked as a part-time barmaid at [[The Queen Vic]], at Tates Paint Factory and in 1991 she became part owner of the Bridge Street café with [[Kathy Hills|Kathy Beale]] and [[Frank Butcher]].<ref name="first10years"/>

Pauline had an enduring friendship with fellow launderette colleague, [[Dot Branning|Dot Cotton]], who was once her mother's close friend, but became Pauline's following Lou's death. After her first husband's death she played the dutiful widow for many years, but finally allowed romance into her life in 2005 and remarried [[Joe Macer]].

Pauline was a stubborn and strong-willed character, who made her opinions known. Her arch-enemy was [[Den Watts]]; a family-friend who got her daughter Michelle pregnant at just 16. She was unhappy when he 'returned from the dead' in 2003, but perhaps quietly pleased upon discovering that it was her doorstop which marked his eventual death in 2005.

Although viewed as a battleaxe, Pauline was never one to neglect her [[Christianity|Christian]] duties and has housed many waifs and strays over the years, including her nephew, [[Conor Flaherty|Conor]] and his daughter, [[Mary Flaherty|Mary]], as well as [[Naima Jeffery]], [[Aidan Brosnan]], [[Mandy Salter]], [[Nellie Ellis]], Dot Cotton, [[Derek Harkinson]], her life long friend [[Ethel Skinner]] (who came back to Albert Square to die in 2000) and not to mention her [[Cairn Terrier]] [[List of pets in EastEnders|Betty]], who became her inseparable sidekick.

===The early years===
[[Image:PAUL LOU.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pauline standing up to her mother in the first episode of the programme (February 1985).]]
Arthur was made redundant in 1984. At age 43, he had no prospects for steady employment and his main source of support was state benefits. Money was tight for the Fowlers so Pauline's unexpected pregnancy in 1985 came at a very bad time. At the age of 41 she was rather surprised to be a parent again, but her mother had an even stronger reaction; with Arthur jobless Lou was sure that Pauline couldn't afford another child and told her to "[[abortion|get rid of it]]". Standing up to the formidable Lou for the first time in her life, Pauline refused to abort her baby. The Fowlers had to work very hard to win Lou round, going as far as arranging a holiday for her in [[Clacton-on-Sea]], with Michelle, in an effort to cheer her up. Eventually Lou relented but, despite the birth of young [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] in July, 1985 was a far from happy year for the family. Mark got himself in trouble with the police and eventually ran away from home in April and 16 year old Michelle stunned her family by announcing that she was pregnant by a mystery man. Pauline worried about both her teenage children, particularly the wayward Mark, and went to [[Southend-on-Sea]] to track him down in December that year. To her surprise he had settled down with an older woman and her children and refused to return home.<ref name="first10years"/>

1986 was just as tough for Pauline. Her eldest son was put into a detention centre for [[burglary]] and [[assault]], and after stealing the residents Christmas club money, Arthur had a [[mental breakdown]] and was hospitalised. More bad news followed in 1987 when Arthur was forced to serve a prison sentence for the theft. Pauline and Michelle were forced to repay the money to everyone that Arthur had stolen from. Still strapped for cash Pauline almost turned to a life of crime herself, when she agreed to sell stolen meat for [[Den Watts]], although she pulled out at the last minute. Pauline also made a shocking discovery in 1987, when she witnessed Den Watts trying to give Michelle money, and correctly figured out that he was the father of her daughter, [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]].<ref name="EEHandbook"/> So began a feud between Pauline and Den, which lasted for the remainder of Den's life. Towards the end of the year Pauline and the other women of Walford all joined forces to make a ladies' darts team. They entered a tournament which sent them to [[Greenwich]] and the [[Isle Of Dogs]] and while away Pauline met an admirer named Derek Taylor.<ref>"[http://archives.walford.net/0268.htm ''EastEnders'' TUE 08-SEP-87 episode description]", ''Walford.net''. URL last accessed on [[2006-12-03]].</ref>  Derek was so taken with Pauline that the following day he turned up in Walford and met her secretly, whilst trying to convince her that she was unhappy in her marriage. On their third meeting he attempted to make a move on her, but despite being tempted she turned him down for Arthur's sake, and Derek disappeared.<ref name="EEHandbook"/>

[[Image:Pauline Den prison.jpg|left|thumb|Pauline visits Den in prison and forces a deal (1988).]]
After Michelle went behind [[Lofty Holloway|Lofty]]'s back and aborted their unborn child (a procedure paid for by Den), Pauline went to confront Den, and finally admitted that she knew he was Vicki's father and promised him she wouldn't rest until she saw him out of Walford. She spent most of her time trying to dig up incriminating evidence so she could force Den to leave and, when Michelle caught her going through her things, Pauline confessed she knew Den was Vicki's father and told her that she had to keep Den away from Vicki or she would inform everybody about her secret. Knowing the severe repercussions that would follow, Michelle was forced to oblige. The year was tainted with sadness for Pauline as her mother, Lou, died in July, and Pauline promptly took on her role as the Beale/Fowler battleaxe. Pauline was thrilled when Den was imprisoned on remand later in the year. However her ire rose once again when she discovered that Den had been sending Michelle and Vicki Christmas presents from inside. She visited Den at the prison for a slanging match, and despite Den's smart comments she silenced him by promising to inform his daughter [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] that he was Vicki's father unless he kept away from her family.<ref name="xmas88">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19881222.shtml Xmas 88 - Den in prison]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-11-08]].</ref> She finally managed to get rid of Den when he was shot and presumed dead in February 1989. However Den still managed to cause problems for the Fowlers from beyond the grave when Arthur discovered the truth about Vicki.

In July 1989 Pauline began to go through some poor health. Fearing that she may need a serious [[gynaecology|gynaecological]] operation, she decided to cancel her appointment at the hospital and try [[hypnotherapy]] instead. This didn't work and Pauline was forced to hand in her notice at the launderette due to chronic tiredness, whilst keeping her discomfort hidden from Arthur. However, in September that year, [[Ricky Butcher]], who was joyriding in his father's car, ran into Pauline causing her to be hospitalised with a cracked rib.<ref name="first10years"/> The accident proved to be a blessing in disguise as the check-over brought her news that she was suffering with [[fibroids]] and she had to have a [[hysterectomy]]. Pauline was deeply saddened by this, feeling that it would somehow make her feel incomplete as a woman. She was forced to spend Christmas in hospital recovering from the operation, but everyone in Albert Square turned up to visit her on Christmas day, which managed to put a smile on her face, albeit briefly.<ref name="EEHandbook"/>

===Pauline's heartache===
[[Image:PAUL ARTHIV.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pauline and Arthur are stunned by Mark's confession (1991).]]
Pauline was overjoyed when her son, [[Mark Fowler|Mark]], returned home in 1990 after nearly five years away. However Pauline began to worry that something was wrong with Mark when he became even more secretive and moody than usual. Her suspicion rose when she discovered mysterious helpline cards in his clothes and noticed how irrational he got when he cut himself. On [[26 December]] ([[Boxing Day]]) 1991 Mark finally decided to tell his parents what was wrong with him. Pauline and Arthur sat in stunned silence as Mark confessed that he was [[HIV positive people|HIV positive]].<ref name="xmas91">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19911226.shtml Grant and Sharon get hitched]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2007-01-01]].</ref> Pauline was distraught, whilst Arthur reacted with severe hostility and blame. After a difficult period, in which Arthur and Pauline nearly came to blows over the subject, Arthur finally came round after seeing a father treating his son badly in a pub.<ref name="20years">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|id=ISBN 0-563-52269-0}}</ref>

Arthur then began to busy himself with his new occupation as a gardener, most notably for the lonely divorcée [[Christine Hewitt]]. At the end of May 1992, a phone call from [[New Zealand]] brought news that Pauline's brother [[Kenny Beale|Kenny]] had been in a car crash and, with Pete's financial help, Pauline decided to go and visit him (in fact, Wendy Richard had to be written out of the series to allow her time to make a series of ''[[Grace and Favour]]'').<ref name="first10years"/> While she was away Arthur and Christine became extremely close, causing a certain amount of gossip on the Square. Eventually Christine made a pass at Arthur, and although he was tempted, he turned her down. She then disappeared sending him a letter and photo explaining her feelings. When Pauline came home however, she learnt all about Christine from gossips such as [[Dot Branning|Dot Cotton]]. Although she believed Arthur when he explained that nothing untoward had occurred, all that changed when she discovered Christine's love letter. Pauline went to see Christine to discover the truth, and found her to be a lonely figure who drank too much of an afternoon. Pauline was persuaded to forgive Arthur and start over, but Arthur couldn't manage to stay away from Christine and continued to see her behind Pauline's back. Arthur kept finding excuses to drop in on her, until she told him not to come over again unless he meant business. On Christmas Eve Arthur sneaked away to be with Christine and they ended the night in bed.<ref name="20years"/>

[[Image:Paul arth fryin.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Pauline hits Arthur with a frying pan.]]
Despite Christine's encouragement, Arthur was never really at ease with having to lie to Pauline, but things became easier when Pauline herself became the subject of another man's attention in 1993. [[Danny Taurus]] was the stage name of an [[East End of London|East End]] [[rock and roll]] singer, who had nearly been famous locally when Pete and Pauline were teenagers. Danny was now a rather pathetic pub singer, who dreamed of making a comeback and was stunned to meet Pauline again, as he had always [[limerence|fancied]] her when they were at school together. Danny and Pauline went on a few platonic dates — Pauline's motive being to see if Arthur might respond to a bit of competition — but Danny took it seriously and asked Pauline to go away with him. Despite being tempted, Pauline turned him down and Danny went off in search of his big break.<ref name="first10years"/> Pauline then decided to go on holiday to [[Leigh-on-Sea]] and while she was away Arthur and Christine's affair continued. Christine began to make greater demands on Arthur, threatening that if he didn't tell Pauline about their affair, she would. Arthur began to realise that he had made a mistake. In September, under duress, Arthur decided to inform Pauline about his infidelity and tried to tell her that he wanted her and not Christine. Hurt, embarrassed and angry, Pauline responded by hitting Arthur in the face with a frying pan and then threw him out of their home.<ref name="20years"/> 

Arthur was forced to move in with his son, Mark, and he spent the rest of the year desperately trying to make up with his wife. Pauline and Arthur eventually reconciled when he helped her deal with the death of her beloved brother [[Pete Beale|Pete]] at the end of the year. At first Arthur slept alone, but after the family was successful in persuading [[Ian Beale]] and [[David Wicks]] to sell Mark the fruit and veg stall (that Pete had left them in his will), Pauline accepted Arthur back into her bed. They then began to rebuild their marriage. The affair was never allowed to be forgotten, however, particularly when Pauline's aunt [[Nellie Ellis]] came to lodge and discovered his escapades.<ref name="first10years"/>

===Arthur's demise===
In 1995 Arthur was elected secretary of the [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] committee, and started raising money to create a new eco-friendly, urban garden, which was named the Flowering Wilderness Fund. His old friend, [[Willy Roper]], took a keen interest in Arthur's financial dealings. By the end of the year Arthur had managed to raise [[pound sterling|£]]20,000 for the garden, and this was enough to tempt Willy to crime.<ref name="20years"/>

Willy was the sole carer of his [[dementia|senile]] mother, and desperate to get the funds to pay for her placement at a nursing home, he decided to con Arthur into signing the fund money into various different accounts, and then leave Arthur to face the music when the money was declared missing. For a second time, Arthur was faced with a police investigation and with all the evidence stacked against him, he was soon arrested and ended the year behind bars. This was too much for Arthur, who was unable to face the prospect of serving a prison sentence for a crime he didn't commit, and upon his imprisonment he suffered a mental breakdown and refused any contact with Pauline, which devastated her.<ref name="20years"/>

Not content with putting Arthur in prison, Willy spent the beginning of 1996 trying to woo Pauline in his absence. Mark was furious at the amount of time Willy and Pauline spent together, but Pauline found Willy to be a great comfort and refused to stop seeing him socially.<ref name="20years"/> Following Willy's mother's death in April 1996, he asked Pauline to go away to [[Jersey]] on holiday. Mark correctly figured out that his real motive was to put the stolen money in an off-shore account under a false name, but Pauline refused to believe Mark's accusations. While away, Pauline and Willy became very close, but this all changed when Pauline discovered [[counterfeit]] credit cards on Willy and her suspicions began to raise.<ref>"[http://archives.walford.net/1285.htm ''EastEnders'' TUE 30-APR-96 episode description]", ''Walford.net''. URL last accessed on [[2006-12-03]].</ref> She didn't inform Willy of her discovery, but immediately returned to Walford the following day after Willy confessed his undying love for her. 

[[Image:Pauline Arthur EastEnders.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pauline collects Arthur from Prison in 1996, days before his death.]]
Back in Walford a furious Pauline was then persuaded by Mark to extract a confession from Willy. She lured him over under the pretence that she wanted to rekindle their friendship. On their night alone Pauline managed to  find out how he had managed to [[embezzlement|embezzle]] the money and [[frameup|frame]] Arthur; the police were informed and Willy was arrested and charged.<ref>"[http://archives.walford.net/1289.htm ''EastEnders'' THU 09-MAY-96 episode description]", ''Walford.net''. URL last accessed on [[2006-12-03]].</ref>

Arthur was cleared, but before Pauline could pass on the good news to him she was told that he had been involved in a prison riot. Arthur was released the next day, but he had received a nasty blow to the head in the riot, although no one realised the seriousness of his injury until it was too late. Only a few days after his release in May 1996, Arthur suffered a [[brain haemorrhage]] on the allotments, and died the next day in hospital.<ref name="20years"/>

Arthur's funeral was delayed pending an inquest, but the jury eventually returned a verdict of accidental death, much to the disgust of Mark and Pauline, who felt that the prison services neglected to seek proper medical help for Arthur.<ref name="20years"/> 

A bench was placed in dedication to his memory in Albert Square.  The dedication reads "Arthur Fowler: He loved this place".

===Family issues===
Following Arthur's death Pauline engrossed herself in her family, seeing it as her duty to keep it together. She often interfered in their issues and caused rifts in her children's relationships.

She was shocked and overjoyed in 1997 when she discovered that she had a long lost sister, [[Maggie Flaherty]], whom her mother had given up for adoption after she was born out of wedlock. She and the rest of the Fowlers travelled to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] that year to meet her. However the holiday was not a great success, and Pauline was put in an awkward position when her elder sister's husband attempted to seduce her.<ref name="20years"/>

Several eligible bachelors expressed their interest in Pauline over the following years, including [[Jeff Healy (EastEnders)|Jeff Healy]] (who proposed) and [[Eddie Skinner]], and she even briefly dated  [[Terry Raymond]] for a while.<ref name="22 May 2001">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20010522_p3.shtml Episode guide - 22 May 2001]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-11-08]].</ref> Pauline remained staunchly faithful to her late husband's memory and refused to let the relationships progress beyond companionship. For a while it looked as if Pauline was finally willing to begin a new relationship with her old childhood friend, [[Derek Harkinson]], in 2001. However he stunned her by confessing that he was [[homosexuality|gay]].<ref name="18 Dec 2001">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20011218_p4.shtml Episode guide - 18 Dec 2001]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-11-08]].</ref>  Despite her initial upset, Pauline and Derek remained good friends and Derek came to lodge with the Fowlers for several years.

When Pauline discovered that her youngest son Martin was the father of [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]]'s baby, [[Rebecca Miller (EastEnders)|Chloe]], in 2001, she became determined to adopt the child. Sonia, was severely opposed to this. She refused to allow Pauline custody and instead decided to put Chloe up for adoption. Pauline threatened to take Sonia to court for custody of the baby, but was forced to back down when Martin eventually admitted that he didn't want to be a father.<ref name="20years"/>
 
As Pauline grew older, her tendency to interfere in everyone's business increased. She took after her mother as a traditionalist, with strict rules and beliefs, and although she was the first to criticise, she fully defended her family. She was particularly hostile to the many women who featured in her sons' lives, coming to epitomise the archetypal mother-in-law. This included Mark's wives [[Ruth Fowler|Ruth Aitken]] — whom she couldn't forgive for cheating on her son with his cousin [[Conor Flaherty|Conor]] — and [[Lisa Fowler|Lisa Shaw]]. She was extremely opposed to Mark's union with Lisa, especially when she discovered that the pair were lying about Mark being the father of Lisa's baby, [[Louise Mitchell|Louise]], in order to fool the real father, [[Phil Mitchell]]. She initially refused to go along with their scam, but eventually came round when the baby was born and even bonded with the child in her new role as acting grandmother. However in 2002 Pauline received an anonymous letter informing her of Lisa and Phil's affair and became determined to split her and Mark up, which Mark begrudged.<ref name="20years"/>

[[Image:Pauline Funeral.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Pauline grieves at Mark's funeral (2004).]]
Pauline's overbearing ways only served to alienate her wayward son Martin, and she couldn't curtail his deviance. With Martin serving a spell in a detention centre for the [[manslaughter]] of [[Jamie Mitchell]], she began to rely on her older son more than ever. When Mark discovered that his [[HIV]] medication was failing he could no longer cope with Pauline's dependence and was unable to allow his mother to witness his slow and painful deterioration. She tried everything she could to protect him, often smothering him in the process, and found it especially difficult when Mark made the decision to spend his last few months travelling the world, instead of with his family in Albert Square.<ref name="14 Feb 2003">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20030214_p4.shtml Episode guide - 14 Feb 2003]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-11-08]].</ref> His death in 2004 hit her hard, and this perhaps made her more protective of her last remaining son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]].

She continued to meddle in Martin's life and refused to loosen her control over him, even when he decided to marry Sonia. Her interference in their wedding plans caused the couple to [[elope]] and marry away from Walford, which deeply saddened Pauline.<ref name="Thu 10 Jun 2004">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20040610.shtml Episode guide - Thu 10 Jun 2004]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-11-08]].</ref> Desperate to keep Martin within her grasp, she made them an offer they couldn't refuse, by signing over half her house to them so they had to remain living with her. Sonia found it especially difficult to cope with Pauline and many rows erupted with Martin in the middle. Things reached an all time low when Pauline decided to go behind Sonia's back and visit her grandchild Rebecca (formerly Chloe), who had been adopted. Following the death of her adoptive parents, Rebecca was in the custody of her adoptive grandmother [[Margaret Wilson (EastEnders)|Margaret Wilson]], and she begrudgingly allowed Pauline access to her. Sonia was furious and the warring women were [[wikt:at loggerheads|at loggerheads]] for a long while, with Pauline adamant that Sonia and Martin should take steps to regain custody of Rebecca.<ref name="Fri 29 Apr 2005">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20050429.shtml Episode guide - Fri 29 Apr 2005]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-11-08]].</ref> Pauline was later furious when she discovered that Sonia had embarked on a [[lesbian]] affair with [[Naomi Julien]] in 2005, and couldn't forgive the pain she had caused her son. After Martin was given custody of Rebecca, she made it her mission to exclude Sonia from her granddaughter's life. Her intrusion increased the rift between Sonia and Martin and she managed to keep Sonia at bay for a long time. However, Martin was unable to keep Sonia away from his daughter indefinitely, and as he began to cede, Pauline concocted ever more elaborate ways to obstruct Sonia's involvement and their personal feud continued.<ref name="Mon 07 Aug 2006">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20060807.shtml Episode guide - Mon 07 Aug 2006]", ''BBC''.

===Second marriage===
[[Image:Pauline&Joe.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pauline and Joe marry.]]
In August 2005, Pauline became close friends with [[Joe Macer]], whom she met whilst attending [[salsa dance]] classes. Although Joe was obviously drawn to Pauline, as usual he was kept at bay by Pauline's unwillingness to betray Arthur's memory. Pauline eventually allowed him to get closer to her and it wasn't long before Joe had fallen in love with Pauline and proposed to her in a crowded [[Queen Vic]]. She said no but Joe did not give up (since he knew that Pauline was fond of him and daren't admit so) and asked her again in February 2006 after falsely telling her that he would leave to live in [[Dubai]] unless she would commit to their relationship; this time she said yes.<ref name="Mon 06 Feb 2006">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20060206.shtml Episode guide - Mon 06 Feb 2006]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-11-08]].</ref>

Pauline was intitially hostile to Joe's daughter [[Megan Macer|Megan]], but she eventually warmed to her slightly and Megan helped persuade Pauline to go through with the wedding when she was having second thoughts about remarrying. Just as Joe was about to cancel the wedding, Pauline changed her mind, and the happy couple were married on [[17 February]] [[2006]]. Martin was Joe's [[best man]], her great-niece [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] and her granddaughter Rebecca were bridesmaids, and her best friend Dot Branning was the [[maid of honor|matron of honour]]. Pauline chose to keep her surname as Fowler since she felt that she had lived most of her life with the name and didn't want a 'new identity'.<ref name="Fri 17 Feb 2006">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20060206.shtml Episode guide -Fri 17 Feb 2006 -Pauline's wedding day]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-11-08]].</ref>

Just two months into their marriage, in late April 2006, Pauline gave Joe an ultimatum after discovering his criminal past with [[Bert Atkinson]] — his marriage to Pauline or his friendship with Bert. After he refused to choose between them, she threw him out of her house. She forgave him in June 2006 after he converted her loft.<ref name="Fri 21 Apr 2006">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20060421.shtml Episode guide -Fri 21 Apr 2006-Pauline issues an ultimatum]", ''BBC''.

===Deception and reclusiveness===
In November 2006, Martin and Pauline argued regarding Pauline's treatment of Sonia. Pauline became morose and despondent, rejecting her husband and wallowing in her own depression. Tired of Pauline's miserable demeanour, those closest to her (Dot, Joe, Martin and Sonia) vented their frustrations at the Fowler household, only to be overheard by Pauline, who was secretly listening upstairs. Here she learnt that Martin and Sonia were back together as well as Martin's painful confession that he didn't really love her because she was so difficult to please. Deeply upset by what she had heard, Pauline lit up one of Dot's cigarettes that had been left behind, but, while she was upstairs packing, it fell out of the ashtray and ignited a fire. As the fire began to consume the house, Pauline remained in her room and refused to acknowledge the calls of Martin, who had realised she was still inside and returned to rescue her. She spent a few days in hospital.<ref name="Fri 24 Nov 2006">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20061124.shtml Episode guide -Fri 24 Nov 2006-Pauline's fateful decision]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-12-20]].</ref> Pauline could not forgive her family for their harsh words and planned to put a stop to Martin's relationship with Sonia. She informed her loved ones that a routine checkup while she was in hospital had revealed that she had a [[brain tumour]]. This news devastated Martin and Joe, but it had the desired effect as Martin decided to call off his relationship with Sonia in order to put his mother's wishes first and devote himself to caring for her.<ref name="Mon 27 Nov 2006">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20061127.shtml Episode guide -Mon 27 Nov 2006-Pauline shares her secret]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-12-20]].</ref>

Pauline later admitted her ploy to nephew [[Ian Beale]], and also helped him exert his revenge on his fiancée [[Jane Collins]], who had had an affair with [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]]. Pauline coaxed Ian to stand her up at the altar on their wedding day, so he could shame both Jane and the Mitchell family at the same time. She took great pleasure in the entire scenario, especially seeing the stunned reaction of [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]]. However, Pauline was furious when Ian decided to give Jane another chance, and refused to acknowledge his pleas that she tell Martin the truth about her condition.<ref name="Fri 01 Dec 2006">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20061127.shtml Episode guide -Fri 01 Dec 2006-Jane's wedding day]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-12-20]].</ref>

An overwrought Martin announced in the Queen Victoria that his mother was seriously sick with a brain tumour. Pauline began to feel guilty about her deception, but this changed when she returned home to see Martin and Sonia embracing each other. Furious, Pauline admitted that she had known about their relationship all along and tried to make Martin feel guilty about deceiving her. However she was soon silenced when Joe divulged that he had been to the hospital to enquire about Pauline's treatment options, and had found nothing to back up her story. He accused Pauline of making the illness up, and she was forced to admit the truth.<ref name="Mon 11 Dec 2006">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20061211.shtml Episode guide -Mon 11 Dec 2006-Pauline stands accused]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-12-20]].</ref>

Unable to be around Pauline any longer, both Joe and Martin moved in with the Brannings, leaving Pauline alone. Undeterred, Pauline refused to admit that what she had done was wrong and instead blamed Martin and Joe for everything. For a while she refused to come out of her house and ignored everyone who came to check up on her. Peggy, who had battled with a life threatening illness herself, was particularly compassionate towards Pauline and organised a fundraising event in Pauline's honour. Finally, Martin could take it no longer, and informed Peggy of his mother's deception. The news spread, and she was met with disapproval wherever she went: her gate was even [[graffiti|graffito-tagged]] with the word "LIAR". Still unphased, Pauline decided to exert her revenge on her son by actively cutting him out of her life. She informed him that she was taking back the family's fruit and veg stall that Martin worked on, cutting off his only source of income. When Martin refused to vacate the stall, she decided to vandalise all his produce. When Peggy saw this happening she immediately went to Pauline to give her a piece of her mind and earned a slap for her trouble.<ref name="Thu 21 Dec 2006">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20061221.shtml Episode guide -Thu 21 Dec 2006]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2006-12-20]].</ref>

Joe made one more attempt to get Pauline to rethink her decision to cut Martin from her life. However Pauline was far from pleasant to her husband. She informed Joe that he was half the man that Arthur had been and that she had never really loved him. She compared their relationship unfavourably to her marriage with Arthur, including their lacklustre sex life. She then removed her wedding ring and told him the marriage was over. Joe was quick to point out that the perfect marriage with Arthur was nothing but a fantasy, and smashed the pictures of her children and first husband that lay around her living room, while branding Mark "diseased", Michelle a "scrubber" and Arthur a "con". Pauline retaliated by smashing a plate over his head.<ref name="Thu 21 Dec 2006"/> She then made plans to leave Walford to go and live with her daughter [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]] in America.

===Death===
[[Image:Sonia slaps pauline.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sonia slaps Pauline, Christmas Day 2006. This was the only time Pauline received a slap. Pauline had dished out 11 slaps.]]
On [[25 December]] [[2006]], Christmas Day, Sonia came to Pauline to inform her that she and Martin were remarrying. She told her that she didn't want her to leave Walford, but wanted her to stay for Martin's sake. Pauline was repulsed and told Sonia she would not attend the wedding and delighted in telling her why. A heated argument ensued as Pauline insulted Sonia and she retaliated by slapping her. Pauline fell over, knocking over her favourite fruit bowl, which smashed into pieces. Sonia apologised and begged her to rethink her decision for Martin and Rebecca's sake. Despite showing a flicker of doubt, Pauline asked her to leave, still adamant that she was leaving Walford. However, as she was about to take Betty on a walk, she discovered a Christmas card that Rebecca had made her outside her door. She began to realise what she was giving up and decided to stay in Walford after all. She phoned Martin to tell him she had reconsidered leaving, but was unable to get through and left a message, then took Betty and walked through the snow to the Brannings' house to tell him in person. As Pauline walked the short distance across the Square it became apparent that all was not well, as she frequently clutched her head in obvious pain and staggered as she walked. Suddenly she collapsed in the middle of Albert Square gardens near Arthur's bench and lay in the snow motionless. A short time afterwards, she was found by Dot, after hearing Betty barking, who shouted out to Martin for assistance. Martin came over and was horrified to discover that Pauline was lying dead in the snow.

After Pauline's death, Rebecca told Sonia she had seen her hit Pauline, and Sonia attempted to make sure Rebecca told nobody about it.

Pauline's funeral took place on [[1 January]] [[2007]]. Before the funeral, Dot told Rebecca that Pauline died because she needed help from Jesus, who reached down from heaven and took her away. Rebecca responded by saying that it wasn't because of Jesus that Pauline had died, it was because of Sonia.<ref name="Tue 02 Jan 2007">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20070102.shtml Episode guide -Tue 02 Jan 2007-Pauline's funeral]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2007-01-02]].</ref>

The funeral then took place, ending with Pauline's favourite song, "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" by [[Dusty Springfield]], being played. This was interrupted by a visit from the police, who took Pauline's body away.<ref name="Mon 01 Jan 2007">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/episode_content/episode20070101_n2.shtml Episode guide -Mon 01 Jan 2007-Sonia feels cornered]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on [[2007-01-02]].</ref>

An autopsy confirmed that Pauline's death was caused by injuries consistent with those caused by a blow to the head from a heavy object, which as a result caused Pauline to suffer a fatal [[brain haemorrhage]]. The police then believed that Pauline's ex-daughter in  law,Sonia killed Pauline; because she went to the Fowler house and had an argument with her which resulted in Sonia slapping Pauline and Pauline falling to the ground. Sonia fled Walford with Rebecca to escape the police but later returned with her daughter. Sonia wanted to hand herself in to the police in order to clear her name. 

On the same night, Dot went to the Fowlers' house to find Rebecca's toy rabbit, which had been dropped there. Whilst there, Dot heard someone coming into the house, it was Pauline's husband Joe. Dot was suspicious of Joe and threw questions at him, after a while it became apparent that Joe was upset and he soon revealed how hard it was to live with Pauline who saw him as more of a workman than a husband. Joe broke down and he confessed that he came to the Fowlers' house on Christmas Day, minutes before Pauline's death. When Joe came, he had expected to clear the air between him and his wife and to collect his deceased wife's, Jool's jewelry. Pauline had  her bags packed and told Joe that she realised what she was leaving behind, Joe saw a glint of hope for his marriage until Pauline insisted that she wanted Joe to go. A terrible argument followed in which Pauline attacked Joe with harsh words and insults, saying that he wasn't a proper man, that he only threw insults that couldn't hurt her and he wouldn't be able to hurt her with action. Joe confessed to Dot, he'd had a drink or two and Pauline's words had infuriated him very much, he didn't want to let Pauline prove him wrong. In the heat of the moment, Joe grabbed a frying pan and struck Pauline on the head with it. This blow caused Pauline to suffer the [[brain haemorrhage]] that would claim her life. Joe also later died that night after his confession, falling from the first floor window after a struggle with Dot and Jim. Following Joe's death, Sonia was in the clear.

Pauline's ashes are now cared for by Dot, and kept in the launderette, after Ian's children, [[Peter Beale|Peter]] and [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] became convinced that Pauline was haunting them.

==In popular culture==
''EastEnders'' was the first television show to have a "dial-a-soap" facility. Run by [[British Telecom]] in 1985, the facility allowed people who had missed an episode to ring a number and get an instant update. The synopses were scripted to be no longer than one minute and twenty-eight seconds per episode. Wendy Richard, in character as Pauline, was chosen to be the voice at the other end of the line and narrated each episode.<ref name="insidestory"/>

The character of Pauline was mentioned in the successful BBC drama ''[[This Life]]'' in 1997. In one episode of the show two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watched an episode of ''EastEnders'' on television and mocked Pauline's hysterics and her well documented tendency to wear cardigans.

The character has also been spoofed in the successul BBC comedy sketch show, ''[[The Real McCoy (TV series)|The Real McCoy]]'' (1991-1995). One of the show's regular sketches featured a spoof version of ''EastEnders'', with [[black (people)|black]] comedians taking over roles of well known ''EastEnders'' characters who frequented a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian [[Llewella Gideon]] played the role of Pauline and the sketches placed considerable emphasis on her high-pitched voice.<ref name="rubadub">"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn30c4fMpFU The real McCoy.
