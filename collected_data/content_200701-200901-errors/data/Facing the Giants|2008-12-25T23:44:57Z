[[Mark Richt]], head football [[Head coach|coach]] at the [[University Of Georgia|University of Georgia]], makes a [[Cameo appearance| cameo]]. As presented in the film, Coach Taylor played college football under Richt. As Coach Taylor was at SCA for six years, it would have been impossible for him to play college football at the University of Georgia after 2000, when Coach Richt became head coach.  From 1990 to 2000 Mark Richt was the offensive coordinator for [[Florida State University]], so it is presumable that Coach Taylor played football under him at FSU. Also, a news report from [[WALB]] features then-sports anchor Kevin McDermond in a brief cameo.

The movie was shot on [[High-definition video|high definition]] digital video tape (using the Panasonic Varicam) and transferred to film.<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|title=Internet Movie Database|work=Facing the Giants| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805526/|accessdate=September 7|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Using real high school football teams, the football action sequences were shot by the film's [[Director of Photography|director of photography]], Bob Scott, who is a veteran [[cinematographer]] for [[NFL Films]]. Another [[NFL]] Films technician, [[Rob whitehurst|Rob Whitehurst]], recorded the movie's sound. Though never mentioned in the media, there is enough evidence to suggest that the role of J.T. Hawkins, Jr. was written for Georgia native [[Bruce Bruce]].

The church music minister, Mark Willard, wrote the film score. The film also uses seven Christian pop songs from [[Third Day]], [[Casting Crowns]], [[Bebo Norman]], Ana Laura, Josh Bates and Mark Willard. There are five tracks of original score during the soundtrack.

Third Day's distributor is [[Provident Label Group]], which is associated with Provident Films, [[Sony]] and Samuel Goldwyn Pictures. The latter eventually distributed the film nationally. A routine request for permission led to the national release of the film.<ref name=soundtrack>Unknown author, ([[2007-01-30]]).[http://www.facingthegiants.com/dvdsoundtrack.php Soundtrack notes,] ''Facing the Giants'' web site.</ref>

In its first weekend, the film opened on 441 screens nationwide in the United States.<ref name="mojo">{{cite web|title=Facing the Giants |work=[[Box Office Mojo|BoxOfficeMojo.com]] | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=facingthegiants.htm | accessdate=September 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Despite such a small number of theaters, the film opened in twelfth place with $1,343,537. Only three films in the top ten released that weekend grossed more per theater. For such a small budget — $100,000 — the film ultimately was shown in over 1,000 theaters and grossed over $10,000,000 as of [[2007-01-01]].<ref name="mojo" />

===Reviews===
The film only earned a 9% approval rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with 3 positive reviews out of 23 reviews counted and a 38/100 score at [[Metacritic]].<ref name="RTS">{{cite web|title=Rotten Tomatoes|work=Facing the Giants (2006)| url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/facing_the_giants/|accessdate=September 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name="MC">{{cite web|title= Metacritic|work=Facing the Giants| url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/facingthegiants?q=Facing%20the%20Giants |accessdate= September 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref>
Some critics complained that characters confronting problems from an explicitly Christian worldview belonged in church rather than portrayed in film. Josh Rosenblatt wrote, "its feel-good storyline, shopworn message, and bottomless sermonizing would have played better in Sunday school than on the big screen, which is &mdash; let’s face it &mdash; Babylon’s turf."<ref name="AustinCh">{{cite web| title=Austin Chronicle.com |work=Facing the Giants | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3a417777| accessdate=September 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Paul Doro wrote, "''Facing the Giants'' is a sermon much more than it is a movie.

Counter to the foregoing, "the script unfortunately devolves into cliché and cant, other aspects of the movie are quite good &mdash; so good, in fact, that ''Facing the Giants'' shames the efforts of a lot of better-financed moviemakers."<ref name="NWA">{{cite web | title =Northwest Arkansas News' Source|work=Giants predictable but still good news| url= http://nwanews.com/story.php?paper=adg&section=MovieStyle&storyid=168158|accessdate=September 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref> Also in favor of the film, "Here's a badly acted movie with a terrific story line that makes it well worth seeing….

===Rating controversy===
In May 2006, the producers of ''Facing the Giants'' received notice from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] ([[MPAA]]) that the film would be receiving a "Parental Guidance Suggested" rating, or "PG" [[MPAA film rating system|rating]].<ref name= "ABCNews">{{cite web|title=ABC News|work=Film Rating Upsets Christian Groups| url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2105871&page=1| accessdate=September 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref> One of the film's consultants, Mark Joseph, who had also conducted media strategy for films such as ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Passion of The Christ]]'' and had unsuccessfully lobbied [[Walden Media]] to release ''Giants'', alerted ''[[The Drudge Report]]'' which picked up the story on [[June 8]], [[2006]].  Within hours the story was a hot topic in religious and conservative media, outraging many who believed the MPAA was entering uncharted territory by allowing the religious content of a film to influence ratings decisions. In the ensuing days the story garnered media attention in countless media outlets like the ''New York Times, Good Morning America, Fox News'' and countless talk radio programs.<ref name="carmel">{{cite web|title=Carmel Entertainment Group|work=FACING THE GIANTS MPAA Ratings Controversy| url=http://www.carmelentertainmentgroup.com/News/C15A8EF0-CC2F-4447-BD1B-E33F041A198C.html|accessdate=September 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref> 

According to the film's producers, they were originally told the motion picture received a "PG" rating because of its strong religious themes and because it elevated one religion over another.<ref name="ABCNews"/> <!-- Joan Graves, chair of the rating board, [Attribution not found. If source found, restore name.] --> The MPAA later countered that ''Facing the Giants'' contains football violence and also deals with the mature topics of infertility and depression, thus warranting the higher rating and initially denied that religious themes were an issue. The Kendrick brothers expected the "PG" rating because of the movie's mature themes and did not appeal the board's rating.<ref name=carmel>Unknown author ([[2006-06-23]]).

The MPAA, which oversees the rating board, received more than 15,000 email messages within a week because of their decision and the media attention it drew, ten times more than they had ever received for any previous film.<ref name="FilmChat">{{cite web|title= FilmChat|work=Everyone agrees it should be a PG movie, but they can't agree on why… | url= http://filmchatblog.blogspot.com/2006/07/everyone-agrees-it-should-be-pg-movie.html|accessdate=September 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref>
 
Conversely, some Christian groups thought a "PG" rating might sway more teenagers into seeing ''Facing the Giants''. "I think that a 'G' for a lot of teenagers is the kiss of death," [[Focus on the Family]] media specialist Bob Waliszewski told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. "(The PG rating is) a case where unfairness will probably be a blessing in disguise."<ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite web | title=Huffington Post|work=Christian Groups Attack Hollywood Over PG Rating For "Evangelistic" Movie… | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/06/21/christian-groups-attack-h_n_23496.html|accessdate=September 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref><!-- now archived --> One report claimed the publicity garnered from the controversy was worth "about $8 million".<ref name= "Citizen">{{cite web |title=Citizen News|work=Facing the Giants in final week at Albany theater| url= http://www.thecitizen.biz/index.php?id=2243| accessdate =September 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref>
