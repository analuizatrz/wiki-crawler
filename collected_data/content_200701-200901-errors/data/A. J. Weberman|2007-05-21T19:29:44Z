'''Alan J. Weberman''' (born [[May 26]], [[1945]]), better known as '''A.J. Weberman''', is an American writer, political [[Gadfly (social)|gadfly]],  and self-styled founder of the fields of ''garbology'' and ''[[Dylanology]]''. He is best known for his controversial personal confrontations with the musician [[Bob Dylan]] and for his 30-year involvement with the [[Yippies]], a [[counterculture]] network.

==Dylanologist==
[[Image:Aj weberman dylan book cover.jpg|thumb|Weberman's 2005 work on Dylan]]
A.J. Weberman early took a great and abiding—perhaps obsessive—interest in the life and works of Bob Dylan, leaving college to focus on creating a [[Concordance (publishing)|word concordance]] of Dylan's lyrics. Although a strong advocate of Dylan's importance as an artist, he is less supportive of Dylan the man, holding him to be an [[apostate]] to "[[1960s#Big changes during the Sixties|the movement]]" for failing to speak out against the [[Vietnam War]], and maintaining that he is a longtime heroin addict and that he has been HIV positive since the late 1980's but has failed to speak out against unprotected sex.

Weberman's literary analysis of Dylan's work, which he has termed [[Dylanology]], is centered around the concept that, to Dylan, many words have lesser-used meanings differing, sometimes greatly, from their common definitions. "Rain", for instance, often means "destruction" in a Dylan song, as it does, conventionally, in poetry and fiction. 

The example below, based on a passage from Weberman's 2005 work ''Dylan to English Dictionary'' discussing two lines of the Dylan song ''[[A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall]]'', shows this approach. Note, for instance, the illustration of Weberman's contention that the word "alley" in Dylan's lyrics is often specifically a reference to [[Tin Pan Alley]] (and thus to commercial, non-artistic music):

This reading of "alley" as meaning "Tin Pan Alley" is based on Weberman's analysis of his extensive database showing every use of "alley" in Dylan's lyrics, as well as many of his writings, interviews, and comments, and the context in which the word is used. Similar analysis gives the meanings shown for "clown", "died", and so forth. At this point Weberman has translated 700 words out of approximately 2000 in Dylanese.

Although this hermenutical ([[hermenutics]]) approach is not too different from what is used by some academics in studying the Bible modern poetry, Weberman tends to focus on euphemisms for, and allusive references to, common everyday experience and objects rather than on meanings associated with the unconscious mind, mythic symbols, and the like. Weberman's lesser used meaning must be found in a dictionary be it a standard one or a specialized one. Another factor Weberman takes into consideration is what is going on in Dylan's life at the time he wrote a particular poem. If Dylan is being jeered by his folk fans because he switched to rock and roll, he might write sarcastically, "When you whispered in my ear / And asked me if I was living with you or her."

Weberman's application of hermenutics to Dylan's lyrics has yet to win accolades from scholars of popular culture, yet he has focused on Dylan's work as have few others, and offers analyses of Dylan lyrics that, while sometimes outré, are certainly the product of painstaking thought and cannot be dismissed out of hand. In addition, his extensive concordances and word lists have been found useful by some students of Dylan's work.

==Public controversies==
Weberman first came to public notoriety in the late 1960's with his controversial research method of examining and interpreting the contents of Dylan's household garbage cans (ash bins).

This activity raised the question of legality, but it was concluded that household trash placed on a public way has been effectively abandoned as property and is, legally, fair game. 

Legal or no, Dylan and his friends found this methodology, along with what they regarded as Weberman's [[Wiktionary:haruspice|haruspice]]-like tortured reading of meaning into discarded household items, to be an annoying and alarming invasion of privacy.

But even more than his garbage-sifting, it was Weberman's public hectoring of Dylan and his recruiting of like-minded individuals (styled the ''Dylan Liberation Front'') to picket Dylan at home, that made Weberman such an annoying figure, both to Dylan—who physically assaulted Weberman at one point<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/5932153?rnd=1135721710620&has-player=unknown | last = Jacobson | first = Mark | title = Tangled Up In Bob | journal = [[Rolling Stone]] | volume = #RS 866 | date = [[April 12]] [[2001]]}}; photograph [http://www.expectingrain.com/dok/who/who.html here]</ref> &mdash; and to some of Dylan's fans.

==Other pursuits==
Weberman later applied his unusual research methods to [[Richard Nixon]], [[Norman Mailer]], and other celebrities, coining the term "garbology" to describe his methods and writing the book ''My Life in Garbology''.

Weberman, in a manifestation of his leftist politics, also attempted to expand his "Dylan Liberation Front" into a "Rock Liberation Front", intended to pressure pop musicians into greater political activity. [[John Lennon]] was briefly associated with this effort.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.expectingrain.com/dok/who/w/webermanaj.html | title = Weberman, A.J. | work = Bob Dylan Who's Who | publisher = [[Expecting Rain]] }}</ref> More recently Weberman has worked closely with the [[Jewish Defense Organization]] in opposing Nazis, the KKK, Lyndon LaRouche and far-left anti-Zionist activists.[http://jdo.org]

Weberman has also studied the 1963 assassination of US President [[John F. Kennedy]] and was employed by the late Congressman Henry Gonzalez of Texas and Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania. Weberman's book on the subject, ''Coup D’Etat In America'', 
postulates the assassination as part of a [[coup d'etat]] led by rogue [[CIA]] agents Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis (a contract agent) and David Christ, Head of the TSD of the CIA, angered by Kennedy's failure to remove [[Fidel Castro]] from power. The book includes transparent overlays, as in an anatomy textbook, so that the reader can compare the faces of the tramps briefly arrested in Dallas with photos of [[E. Howard Hunt]] and [[Frank Sturgis]]. Weberman's assertion that Hunt was involved in this action led Hunt to initiate a lawsuit, later dropped.

Weberman, an LSD and marijuana advocate, was arrested for marijuana dealing in 2000. He pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges and served a year and a day in jail, where he worked on the ''Dylan to English Dictionary'' and was finally able to make his translations transmit a coherent message when the various translations of words appeared next to or near one another.

In 2005, Weberman and other well-known Yippies, including [[Dana Beal]] and [[Pie Man]] (Aron Kay), joined forces to turn the long-time Yippie headquarters at 9 Bleecker Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side into a counterculture museum. As of 2006, renovation of the building has been partially completed, and a charter from the New York State Board of Regents has been granted. Weberman, who is a member of the Yippie Museum's board of trustees, announced in early 2006, in a typical display of Yippie spoofery, that the museum would house an Institute for the Study of Advanced Political Protest. (See [http://www.thevillager.com/villager_144/museumwillhave.html].)

A film about Weberman, entitled The Ballad of AJ Weberman [http://balladofajweberman.com] won the Raindance Award at the British Independent Film Awards (BIFAs)[http://www.bifa.org.uk/news_story.php?news=27]. He also did research for a book by Peter Lance [http://peterlance.com] on an al-Qaeda triple agent who penetrated the FBI and CIA.
