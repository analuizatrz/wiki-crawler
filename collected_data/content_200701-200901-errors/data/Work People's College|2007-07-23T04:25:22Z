A [[Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]] folk school founded, September 1903, in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] served as a predecessor for Work People's College.  The school moved to [[Duluth, Minnesota]] a few months later and was incorporated as the Finnish People's College and Theological Seminary.  

The original intent of the founders was to set up a school for training clergy while emphasizing Finnish culture and language.  Money was raised by selling shares of stock.  Within a few years control of the institutions shifted to individuals more focused on socialism and worker education.  

By 1907, the institution was renamed Work People's College and K.L. Haataja served as director and instructor.  [[Leo Laukki]] assumed leadership in 1908. 

For a time, members of the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]] contributed funds to support the school.  Rifts developed, however, and by 1921 Work People's College was closely identified with the Industrial Workers of the World ([[IWW]]).

Enrollment was 8 students during the initial year and peaked during the 1910 academic year at over 100 students.  There were roughly 30 students during the final year of operation in 1940-41.  

Work People's College was one of several labor schools in the United States.  Others commonly mentioned include:  [[Commonwealth College, Arkansas]], Denver Labor College, [[Brookwood Labor College]] (NY), Seattle Labor College and [[Highlander Folk School]] (TN).
