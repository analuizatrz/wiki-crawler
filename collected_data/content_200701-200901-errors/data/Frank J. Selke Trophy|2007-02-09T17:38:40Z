The '''Frank J. Selke Trophy''' is awarded annually to the [[National Hockey League]] forward who demonstrates the most skill in the defensive component of the game. The winner is selected by a poll of the ''Professional Hockey Writers' Association'' following the regular season.

The trophy is named in honour of [[Frank J. Selke]], former general manager of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]]. It was the fourth and last of the major NHL awards to be introduced, that have been named after General Managers and owners of the [[History_of_the_National_Hockey_League#The_beginnings_to_The_Original_Six|Original Six teams]] (the other awards are the [[Art Ross Trophy]], [[James Norris Trophy]], and the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]], while some also say that the [[Jack Adams Award]] belongs to that group).

It was first awarded in [[1976-77 NHL season|1977]]. It has been most won by [[Montreal Canadiens]], shared by [[Bob Gainey]] and [[Guy Carbonneau]], on 7 occasions; next-most represented are the [[Detroit Red Wings]], with 4 winners, shared in this respect by [[Sergei Fedorov]], [[Steve Yzerman]] and [[Kris Draper]], and the [[Dallas Stars]] with [[Jere Lehtinen]] winning three Selkes.

There has been only one instance in which a Selke Trophy winner was also awarded the [[Hart Trophy]].  This was accomplished by [[Sergei Fedorov]] for the [[1993-94 NHL season]].  There has not been an instance in which the [[Art Ross Trophy]] winner has been awarded the Selke Trophy.  Fedorov was also the first European to win the award.  The Selke winner with the highest number of points in a trophy winning season is Doug Gilmour, with 127 points in 1992-93.
