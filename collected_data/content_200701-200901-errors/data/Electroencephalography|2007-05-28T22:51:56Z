'''Electroencephalography''' is the [[neurophysiology|neurophysiologic]] measurement of the [[electrical]] activity of the [[brain]] by recording from [[electrodes]] placed on the scalp or, in special cases, [[dura mater|subdurally]] or in the [[cerebral cortex]]. The resulting traces are known as an '''electroencephalogram (EEG)''' and represent an electrical signal (postsynaptic potentials) from a large number of neurons. These are sometimes called '''brainwaves''', though this use is discouraged.<ref name="recom_clin_neurophys_1983>{{cite book | last = Cobb | first = WA | title = Recommendations for the practice of clinical neurophysiology | publisher = Elsevier | date = 1983 | location = Amsterdam | id=ISBN 0-444-80505-2 }}</ref> The EEG is a brain function test, but in clinical use it is a "gross correlate of brain activity".<ref name="eeg_daley_2002>{{cite book | editor=John S. Ebersole | title = Current Practice of Clinical Electroencephalography | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | date = 2002 | id= ISBN 0-7817-1694-2 }}</ref>  Electrical currents are not measured, but rather [[voltage]] differences between different parts of the brain.

"EEGs" are frequently used in experimentation because the process is [[non-invasive]] to the [[research subject]].  The subject does not need to make a decision or behavioral action in order to log data, and it can detect covert responses to [[stimuli]], such as reading.  The EEG is capable of detecting changes in electrical activity in the brain on a millisecond-level. It is one of the few techniques available that has such high [[temporal resolution]]. The other common technique is [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG).

== Clinical use ==

EEG in various forms is most useful as a tool for monitoring and diagnosis in certain clinical situations:
* to distinguish [[epilepsy|epileptic]] [[seizure]]s from other types of spells, such as [[psychogenic non-epileptic seizures]] and [[fainting|syncope (fainting)]]
* to [[seizure types|categorize seizures]] for the purposes of treatment
* to monitor for non-convulsive seizures/non-convulsive status epilepticus
* [[coma]], [[encephalopathy]] and [[brain death]]
* monitoring depth of [[anesthesia]]
* as an indirect indicator of cerebral perfusion in [[carotid endarterectomy]]

It is sometimes useful in assessing [[dementia]], when other examinations are equivocal. In some jurisdictions it has a legal significance and formal criteria are used to assess [[brain death]]. Use of the quantitative EEG (mathematical measurement of aspects of the EEG signal) in primary psychiatric, behavioral and learning disorders is somewhat controversial.

== Research use ==

[[neuroscience|Neuroscientists]] and biological psychiatrists use EEGs to study the function of the brain by recording cerebral activity during controlled behavior of human volunteers and animals in lab experiments. Theories to explain [[sleep]] often rely on EEG patterns recorded during sleep sessions. 

[[Image:1st-eeg.gif|right|frame|An early EEG recording, obtained by [[Hans Berger]] in 1924.]]

== Methods ==

In conventional scalp EEG, the recording is obtained by placing [[electrode]]s on the scalp with a conductive gel, usually after preparing the scalp area by light abrasion to reduce [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. Some EEG systems use a plastic cap into which the electrodes are imbedded.

Electrode placement is accomplished by measuring the scalp. Electrode locations and names are specified by the [[10-20 system (EEG)|International 10–20 system]]. This system ensures a system of placement that is reliable and reproducible. Although EEG is rarely used anymore as the primary method of localizing [[brain tumor|tumors]], it is the primary method of localizing the onset of [[focal seizures|partial seizures]].

Each electrode is connected to one input of a [[differential amplifier]] (one amplifier per pair of electrodes); a reference electrode is connected to the other input of each differential amplifier. These amplifiers amplify the voltage between the active electrode and the reference (typically 1,000–100,000 times, or 60–100 [[decibel|dB]] of voltage gain). The resulting voltage signal is filtered by a [[high-pass filter]] and a [[low-pass filter]], typically set at 0.5 [[hertz|Hz]] and 35–70 Hz, respectively. The high-pass filter typically filters out slow artifact, such as [[Galvanic skin response|electrogalvanic]] signals, whereas the low-pass filter filters out high-frequency artifacts, such as [[electromyography|electromyographic]] signals. An additional [[band-stop filter|notch filter]] is typically used to remove artifact caused by electrical power lines (60 Hz in the United States and 50 Hz in many other countries).

The filtered signal is then output on paper (in older systems), or displayed on a computer screen. A typical adult human EEG signal is about 20-100 µV in when measured from the scalp and is about 1–2 mV when measured from subdural electrodes.

The electrode-amplifier relationships are typically arranged in one of three ways:

; Common reference derivation : One terminal of each amplifier is connected to the same electrode, and all other electrodes are measured relative to this single point. It is typical to use a reference electrode placed somewhere along the scalp midline, or a reference that links both earlobe electrodes.
; Average reference derivation : The outputs of all of the amplifiers are summed and averaged, and this averaged signal is used as the common reference for each amplifier.
; Bipolar derivation : The electrodes are connected in series to an equal number of amplifiers.  For example, amplifier 1 measures the difference between electrodes A and B, amplifier 2 measures the difference between B and C, and so on.

This distinction has become void with the advent of digital  or ''paperless'' EEGs, which record all electrodes against an arbitrary reference and will calculate the above relationships (called ''montages'') post hoc.

===Limitations===
EEG has several limitations. Scalp electrodes are not sensitive enough to pick out individual [[action potential]]s, the electric unit of signaling in the brain, or whether the resulting electrical activity is releasing inhibitory, excitatory or modulatory [[neurotransmitter]]s. Instead, the EEG picks up the activity of large groups of [[neuron]]s, which produces a greater voltage than the firing of an individual neuron. Secondly, EEG has limited anatomical specificity when compared with other functional brain imaging techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). Some anatomical specificity can be gained with the use of [[EEG topography]], which uses a large number of electrodes to [[triangulation|triangulate]] the source of the electrical activity.

===Advantages===
EEG has several strong sides as a tool of exploring the brain activity. The time resolution is very high. As other methods for researching brain activity have time resolution between seconds and minutes, the EEG has a resolution down to sub-millisecond. As the brain is thought to work through its electric activity, EEG is the only method to measure it directly. Other methods for exploring functions in the brain rely on blood flow or metabolism which may be decoupled from the brain electric activity. Newer research typically combines EEG or [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] with [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] or [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] to get high temporal and spatial resolution.''

== Activity types ==

[[Image:eeg_raw.svg|thumb|One second of EEG signal|400px|right]]
Historically four major types of continuous rhythmic sinusoidal EEG activity are recognized (alpha, beta, delta and theta). There is no precise agreement on the frequency ranges for each type.
* [[Delta wave|Delta]] is the frequency range up to 4 Hz and is often associated with the very young and certain [[Encephalopathy|encephalopathies]] and underlying lesions. It is seen in [[NREM|stage 3 and 4]] sleep.
[[Image:eeg_delta.svg|thumb|Delta waves.|400px|right]]
* [[Theta wave|Theta]] is the frequency range from 4 Hz to 8 Hz and is associated with drowsiness, childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. This EEG frequency can sometimes be produced by [[hyperventilation]]. Theta waves can be seen during [[Hypnagogic state|hypnagogic]] states such as trances, [[hypnosis]], deep day dreams, [[lucid dreaming]] and light [[sleep]] and the preconscious state just upon waking, and just before falling asleep. 
[[Image:eeg_theta.svg|thumb|Theta waves.|400px|right]]
* [[Alpha waves|Alpha]] ([[Hans Berger|Berger]]'s wave) is the frequency range from 8 [[Hertz|Hz]] to 12 Hz. It is characteristic of a relaxed, alert state of consciousness. For alpha rhythms to arise, usually the eyes need to be closed. Alpha attenuates with drowsiness and open eyes, and typically come from the occipital (visual) cortex.  An alpha-like normal variant called [[Mu rhythm|mu]] is sometimes seen over the motor cortex (central scalp) and attenuates with movement, or rather with the intention to move.
[[Image:eeg_alpha.svg|thumb|Alpha waves.|400px|right]]
* [[sensorimotor rhythm]] (SMR) is a middle frequency (about 12–16 Hz) associated with physical stillness and body presence. 
[[Image:eeg_SMR.svg|thumb|SMR waves.|400px|right]]
* [[Beta wave|Beta]] is the frequency range above 12 Hz.  Low amplitude beta with multiple and varying frequencies is often associated with active, busy or anxious thinking and active concentration. Rhythmic beta with a dominant set of frequencies is associated with various pathologies and drug effects, especially [[benzodiazepines]].
[[Image:eeg_beta.svg|thumb|Beta waves.|400px|right]]
* [[Gamma wave|Gamma]] is the frequency range approximately 26–100 Hz.  Gamma rhythms may be involved in higher mental activity, including perception, problem solving, fear, and consciousness.
[[Image:eeg_gamma.svg|thumb|Gamma waves.|400px|right]]
Rhythmic slow activity in wakefulness is common in young children, but is abnormal in adults. In addition to the above types of rhythmic activity, individual transient waveforms such as sharp waves, spikes, spike-and-wave complexes occur in epilepsy, and other types of transients occur during sleep.

In the transition from wakefulness, through Stage I sleep (drowsiness), Stage II (light) sleep, to Stage III and IV (deep) sleep, first the alpha becomes intermittent and attenuated, then disappears.  Stage II sleep is marked by brief bursts of highly rhythmic beta activity (sleep spindles) and K complexes (transient slow waves associated with spindles, often triggered by an auditory stimulus).  Stage III and IV are characterized by slow wave activity.
After a period of deep sleep, the sleeper cycles back to stage II sleep and/or [[rapid eye movement]] (REM) sleep, associated with dreaming.  These cycles may occur many times during the night.

EEG under general anesthesia depends on the type of anesthetic employed.  With halogenated anesthetics and intravenous agents such as [[propofol]], a rapid (alpha or low beta), nonreactive EEG pattern is seen over most of the scalp, especially anteriorly; in some older terminology this was known as a WAR (widespread anterior rapid) pattern, contrasted with a WAIS (widespread slow) pattern associated with high doses of [[opiate]]s.  Anesthetic effects on EEG signals are beginning to be understood at the level of drug actions on different kinds of synapses and the circuits that allow synchronized neuronal activity (see: http://www.stanford.edu/group/maciverlab/).

==Artifacts==
===Biological artifacts===
Signals in the EEG that are of non-cerebral origin are called [[Artifact (observational)|artifacts]]. The EEG is nearly always contaminated by such signals. This is one of the reasons why it takes considerable experience to interpret EEGs clinically. The most common types of artifacts are:
* Eye artifacts (including eyeball, ocular muscles and eyelid)
* [[Electrocardiogram|EKG]] artifacts
* [[Electromyography|EMG]] artifacts
* Glossokinetic artifacts

Eyeball artifacts are caused by the potential difference between the [[cornea]] and [[retina]], which is quite large compared to cerebral potentials. When the eye is completely still, this is not a problem. But there are nearly always small or large reflexive eye movements, which generates a potential which is picked up in the frontopolar and frontal leads. Eye movements - whether vertical or horizontal [saccades] - are caused by ocular muscles, which also generate [[electromyography|electromyographic]] potentials. Purposeful or reflexive eye blinking also generates [[electromyography|electromyographic]] potentials, but more importantly there is reflexive movement of the eyeball during blinking which gives a characteristic artefactual appearance of the EEG (see [[Bell's phenomenon]]). 

Eyelid fluttering artifacts of a characteristic type were previously called Kappa rhythm (or Kappa waves). It is usually seen in the prefrontal leads, that is, just over the eyes. Sometimes they are seen with mental activity. They are usually in the Theta (4–7 Hz) or Alpha (8–13 Hz) range. They were named because they were believed to originate from the brain. Later study revealed they were generated by rapid fluttering of the eyelids, sometimes so minute that it was difficult to see. They are in fact noise or "artifact" in the EEG reading, and should not technically be called a rhythm or wave. Therefore, the term Kappa rhythm (or wave) is no longer used in electroencephalography. It should be described as eyelid fluttering artifact.<ref name="recom_clin_neurophys_1983>{{cite book | last = Epstein | first = Charles M. | title = Introduction to EEG and evoked potentials | publisher = J. B. Lippincot Co. | date = 1983 | id = ISBN 0-397-50598-1 }}</ref>

Some of these artifacts are useful. Eye movements are very important in [[polysomnography]], and is also useful in conventional EEG for assessing possible changes in alertness, drowsiness or sleep. 

EKG artifacts are quite common and can be mistaken for spike activity. Because of this, modern EEG acquisition commonly includes a one-channel EKG from the extremities. This also allows the EEG to identify [[cardiac arrythmia]]s that are an important [[differential diagnosis]] to [[syncope]] or other episodic/attack disorders. Glossokinetic artifacts are caused by the potential difference between the base and the tip of the tongue. Minor tongue movements can contaminate the EEG, especially in [[Parkinson's disease|parkinsonian]] and [[tremor]] disorders.

===External artifacts===
In addition to internal artifacts, there are many artifacts which originate from outside the patient. Movement by the patient, or even just settling of the electrodes, may cause ''electrode pops'', spikes originating from a momentary change in the [[impedence]] of a given electrode. From a completely different source, within the United States, poor grounding of the EEG electrodes can cause a significant 60 Hz artifact (50 Hz in many other countries). A third source of possible interference can be the presence of an IV drip; such devices can cause rhythmic, fast, low-voltage bursts, which may be confused for spikes.

===Artifact correction===
Recently, source decomposition techniques have been used to "correct" or "remove" EEG contaminates. These source decomposition approaches - one way or another - attempt to "unmix" EEG signals into some number of underlying components. There are many source separation algorithms and just as many (if not more) assumptions as to the nature of EEG. Regardless, if one happens to agree (and can defend) the principle behind a particular source decomposition method, then there are few arguments against "remixing" only those components that would result in "clean" EEG.
There is no proof yet as to the validity or preciseness of these methods since it is difficult - if even possible - to tell what the EEG ''should'' look like without these artifacts. In reality, EEG is to some extent unpredictable and at times seemingly random.

== History ==

A timeline of the history of EEG is given by Swartz.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Swartz, B.E | year = 1998 | month =  | title = '''Timeline of the history of EEG and associated fields''' | journal = Electroencephalography and clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 106 | issue =  | pages = 173–176 | id =  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6SYX-4FV4S6H-1-1&_cdi=4846&_user=10&_orig=browse&_coverDate=02%2F28%2F1998&_sk=998939997&view=c&wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkWb&md5=47fbbe7e51a806779716fba415b96ab7&ie=/sdarticle.pdf}}</ref>  Richard Caton ([[1842]]–[[1926]]), a physician practicing in [[Liverpool]], presented his findings about electrical phenomena of the exposed cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys in the British Medical Journal in [[1875]].  In 1890, Beck published an investigation of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain of rabbits and dogs which included rhythmic oscillations altered by light.

In 1912, Russian physiologist, Vladimir Vladimirovich Pravdich-Neminsky published the first EEG and the [[evoked potential]] of the [[Mammal|mammalian]] (dog).<ref>Pravdich-Neminsky VV.  Ein Versuch der Registrierung der elektrischen Gehirnerscheinungen (In German). Zbl Physiol 27: 951–960, 1913.</ref>  In 1914, Cybulsky and Jelenska-Macieszyna photographed EEG-recordings of experimentally induced seizures.

German physiologist [[Hans Berger]] ([[1873]]–[[1941]]) began his studies of the human EEG in [[1920]]. He gave the device its name and is sometimes credited with inventing the EEG, though others had performed similar experiments. His work was later expanded by [[Edgar Douglas Adrian]].

In 1934, Fisher and Lowenback first demonstrated epileptiform spikes. In 1935 Gibbs, Davis and Lennox described interictal spike waves and the 3 cycles/s pattern of clinical [[absence seizure|absence seizures]], which began the field of clinical electroencephalography. Subsequently, in 1936 Gibbs and Jasper reported the interictal spike as the focal signature of epilepsy. The same year, the first EEG laboratory opened at Massachusetts General Hospital.

[[Franklin Offner]] ([[1911]]–[[1999]]), professor of biophysics at [[Northwestern University]] developed a prototype of the EEG which incorporated a piezoelectronic inkwriter called a Crystograph (the whole device was typically known as the Offner Dynograph). 

In 1947, The American EEG Society was founded and the first International EEG congress was held. In 1953 Aserinsky and Kleitmean describe REM sleep.

In the 1950s, English physician [[William Grey Walter]] developed an adjunct to EEG called [[EEG topography]] which allowed for the mapping of electrical activity across the surface of the brain.  This enjoyed a brief period of popularity in the 1980s and seemed especially promising for psychiatry.  It was never accepted by neurologists and remains primarily a research tool.

==Various uses ==
The EEG has been used for many purposes besides the conventional uses of clinical diagnosis and conventional cognitive neuroscience. [[Neurofeedback]] remains an important extension, and in its most advanced form is also attemped as the basis of [[Brain-computer interface|brain computer interfaces]]. There are many commercial products substantially based on the EEG. 

For example, as of March 24th [[2007]] a [[US]] company called [http://www.emotiv.com/ Emotiv Systems] launched a [[mind control]] device for [[video game]]s based on Electroencephalography. It was reported by [[Wall Street Journal]]'s Don Clark on [[MSNBC]]<ref>{{cite web
