== History ==

[[Image:CD Blake Auditorium.jpg|thumb|left|CD Blake Auditorium, Bathurst campus, CSU]]
The University was established on [[1 July]] [[1989]] from the merger of several existing separately-administered [[College of Advanced Education|Colleges of Advanced Education]] including the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst, the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education in Albury-Wodonga and the Riverina College of Advanced Education in Wagga Wagga,<ref name="Morris">{{cite book | author=Morris, Sherry | title= Wagga Wagga, a history| publisher=Bobby Graham Publishers, Wagga Wagga| year=1999| id=ISBN 1-875247-12-2}}</ref> through the enactment of The Charles Sturt University Act, 1989 (Act No. 76, 1989). It is named in honour of explorer [[Charles Sturt]].

The Mitchell College of Advanced Education had been formed on [[1 January]] [[1971]], and the Riverina-Murray Institute in Wagga Wagga and Albury-Wodonga had operated since 1985. The latter institution had earlier succeeded the Riverina College of Advanced Education, which was itself the result of an even earlier merger between Wagga Agricultural College and Wagga Teachers College. 

In late 2004, CSU formalised moves to assume control of the [[University of Sydney]]'s [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] campus, which came into force on [[1 January]] [[2005]]. From that date, all new Orange campus students were eligible to qualify for degrees from CSU; continuing students continued to be awarded their degrees from Sydney.

Initially, CSU was one of a handful of Australian universities not to increase tuition fees by 25%, one of the reforms introduced by federal education minister [[Brendan Nelson]] in 2004, but it later voted to increase fees by the full 25% allowable starting from 2006.

On its Bathurst campus, CSU operates a radio station, [[2MCE FM Bathurst|2MCE]], which also acts as the originating studio for ''[[National Radio News]]'', a popular community radio news service. 

CSU Cheese Factory is located at the university's Wagga Wagga campus. Construction was completed in 1998 and cheesemaking commenced in August 1998. CSU cheese "Bidgee Cheese" sales commenced in April 1999 at the Cellar Door at the CSU Winery in Wagga Wagga. Today Bidgee Cheese is sold throughout New South Wales and Victoria.

Students at CSU are represented by Charles Sturt University Student Senate - formerly the CSU Students' Association (CSUSA). The CSU Student Senate is the overarching student body of CSU and comprises the following affiliates:
* Albury-Wodonga Student Representative Committee - formerly Murray Campus Students’ Association
* Mitchell Student Guild - formerly Charles Sturt University Students’ Association Bathurst (CSUSAB) – formerly Mitchell Association of Student Councils
* Dubbo Student Representative Committee
* Rivcoll Student Representative Committee (Wagga campus)– formerly known as Rivcoll Union Inc
* Canberra Student Representative Committee – known as St Mark’s Canberra<ref>[http://stmarksntc.org.au/ Charles Sturt University Students’ Association Canberra]</ref>

After Voluntary Student Unionism was passed by the Howard government, the student unions on all campuses of CSU were dissolved and became Student Representative Committees under the university structure.
