'''William W. Powers State Recreation Area''' is an [[List of Illinois state parks|Illinois state park]] administered by the [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]] on {{convert|580|acre|sqkm|2|}} in the [[Hegewisch, Chicago|Hegewisch]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].<ref name=DNR>{{cite web|url=http://dnr.state.il.us/Lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R2/Wmpow.htm|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=2007|publiserh=Department of Natural Resources|title=William W. Powers - State Recreation Area}}</ref>  The acreage includes {{convert|419|acre|sqkm|2|}} of water in [[Wolf Lake (Indiana/Illinois)|Wolf Lake]] that provides about {{mi to km|6|precision=1}} of [[shoreline]] to [[fishermen]].<ref name=DNR/>  The park hosts about half a million visitors annually.<ref name=Quincy>{{cite web|url=http://www.quincynet.com/illinoisparks/WilliamPowers.htm|title=William W. Powers State Recreation Area|publisher=QuincyNet.com|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=2004}}</ref>

==History==
In 1947 the state acquired a {{convert|160|acre|sqkm|2|}} that became known as the Wolf Lake State Recreation Area. More recent acquisitions were added to the property and have increased the area to its current acreage. In 1965, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] named the area after [[William W. Powers]], a former state legislator.<ref name=DNR/> 

==Wildlife==
Wolf Lake contains [[largemouth bass]], [[northern pike]], [[bluegill]], [[redear sunfish]], [[crappie]], [[bullhead]], [[carp]], [[walleye]], hybrid [[muskie]], and [[yellow perch]].<ref name=DNR/>  [[Birdwatcher]]s enjoy the [[monk parakeet]], which is a [[South American]] [[parrot]], that nests in the park.<ref name=Quincy/>  Hunters enjoy the seasonal [[waterfowl]].<ref name=DNR/>  The park contains many [[willow]] and [[cottonwood]] trees.<ref name=DNR/> 

On [[August 23]] [[2002]], Wolf Lake was one of three neighboring regions that hosted the Calumet [[BioBlitz]].  This bioblitz convened over 150 expert [[scientist]]s to identify and record as many living organisms as possible within 24 hours.  The purpose was to demonstrate the resilience of the extraordinary range of organisms in nature's battle against the South Side of Chicago's collage of [[factory|factories]], [[warehouse]]s, [[forest preserve]]s, [[residence]]s, and [[highway]]s as well as its battle of survival against killer pest species.  Unofficially, the BioBlitz counted 1,815 [[species]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagowildernessmag.org/issues/fall2002/bioblitz.html|accessdate=2007-07-13|date=2002|author=Parker, Don|title=Calumet BioBlitz|publisher=Chicago Wilderness Magazine, Inc.}}</ref>  The BioBlitz included teams of scientists from [[Eastern Illinois University]], [[Field Museum]], [[Forest Preserve District of Cook County]], [[Illinois Natural History Survey]], [[Indiana Department of Natural Resources]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois - Champaign]], [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], and [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish & Wildlife]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/bioblitz/bioblitzteam.html|accessdate=2007-07-13|date=2007|publisher=The Field Museum|title=The BioBlitz Team}}</ref>

[[Lake sturgeon]], [[Endangered species|endangered]] in both Indiana and Illinois, and [[banded killifish]], [[Threatened species|threatened]] in Illinois, are both part of the Wolf Lake ecology.<ref name=CWM/> The lake supports the nesting habitat for four species of endangered birds: [[little blue heron]], [[yellow-crowned night heron]], [[black-crowned night heron]], and [[yellow-headed blackbird]].<ref name=CWM/>

==Use==
The park offers stoves and has shelters available by reservation for [[picnic|picnicking]].  [[Fishing]] and [[hunting]] is permitted in accordance with regulations.  [[Ice fishing]] is permitted in the winter and 10 [[horsepower]] [[motorboat]]s are permitted during the summer.<ref name=DNR/>  The lake has several [[dike]]s that temper the wave height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.ripco.net/~jwn/wolf.html|accessdate=2007-07-15|title=Wolf Lake}}</ref>

The use of the park is protected by several types of volunteers.  For example, at the 14th Annual [[Earth Day]] Wolf Lake Cleanup on [[April 21]] [[2001]], more than 350 volunteers, including [[Hammond, IN]] Mayor [[Duane Dedelow, Jr.]], helped clean up and remove an estimated {{Weight|lbs=36000}} tons of waste.<ref name=CWM/> A week later, Friends of Wolf Lake and associates collected more than 3,000 discarded tires from the lake and its shoreline.<ref name=CWM/> The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and the Illinois Water Survey are also studying ways to halt degradation of the lake and the [[USDA]] Forest Service is helping with a study of public interests in recreation at Wolf Lake.<ref name=CWM/>
