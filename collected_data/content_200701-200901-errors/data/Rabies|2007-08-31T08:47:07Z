'''Rabies''' ({{lang-la|rabies}}, "madness, rage, fury") is a [[virus (biology)|viral]] [[zoonotic]] disease that causes acute [[encephalitis]] (inflammation of the brain) in [[mammal]]s. In non-vaccinated humans, rabies is almost invariably fatal after [[neurological]] symptoms have developed, but prompt post-exposure [[vaccination]] may prevent the virus from progressing. There are only six known cases of a person surviving rabies after the onset of symptoms. <ref>[http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/virol/rabies.htm VIROLOGY - CHAPTER  TWENTY RABIES] pathmicro.med.sc.edu</ref>

==Structure==
The rabies virus is a ''[[Lyssavirus]]''. This [[genus]] of [[RNA virus]]es also includes the [[Aravan virus]], [[Australian bat lyssavirus]], [[Duvenhage virus]], [[European bat lyssavirus 1]], [[European bat lyssavirus 2]], [[Irkut virus]], [[Khujand virus]], [[Lagos bat virus]], [[Mokola virus]] and [[West Caucasian bat virus]]. Lyssaviruses have [[helical]] symmetry, so their infectious particles are approximately cylindrical in shape. This is typical of plant-infecting viruses; human-infecting viruses more commonly have cubic symmetry and take shapes approximating [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]]. ''[[Negri bodies]]'' in the infected neurons are [[pathognomonic]].

The virus has a bullet-like shape with a length of about [[1 E-7 m|180 nm]] and a cross-sectional diameter of about [[1 E-8 m|75 nm]]. One end is rounded or conical and the other end is planar or concave. The [[lipoprotein]] envelope carries knob-like spikes composed of [[Glycoprotein]] G. Spikes do not cover the planar end of the virion (virus particle). Beneath the envelope is the membrane or matrix (M) protein layer which may be [[invaginated]] at the planar end. The core of the virion consists of helically arranged [[ribonucleoprotein]]. The [[genome]] is unsegmented linear [[antisense]] [[RNA]]. Also present in the [[nucleocapsid]] are RNA dependent RNA transcriptase and some structural proteins.

==Differential diagnosis==
The [[differential diagnosis]] in a case of suspected human rabies may initially include any cause of [[encephalitis]],
particularly infection with viruses such as [[herpesviridae|herpesviruses]], [[enteroviruses]], and [[arboviruses]] (e.g., [[West Nile virus]]). The most important viruses to rule out are [[herpes simplex virus]] type 1, [[varicella-zoster virus]], and (less commonly) enteroviruses, including [[coxsackie virus|coxsackievirus]]es, [[echovirus]]es, [[poliovirus]]es, and human [[enterovirus]]es 68 to 71. A specific diagnosis may be made by a variety of diagnostic techniques, including [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) testing of [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[cell culture#Viral culture methods|viral culture]], and [[serology]]. In addition, consideration should be given to the local [[epidemiology]] of [[encephalitis]] caused by arboviruses belonging to several [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] groups, including eastern and western [[equine encephalitis|equine encephalitis virus]]es, [[St. Louis encephalitis]] virus, [[Powassan virus]], the [[California encephalitis virus]] serogroup, and [[La Crosse virus]]. 

New causes of viral encephalitis are also possible, as was evidenced by the recent outbreak in Malaysia of some 300 cases of encephalitis (mortality rate, 40%) caused by [[Nipah virus]], a newly recognized [[paramyxovirus]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Similarly, well-known viruses may be introduced into new locations, as is illustrated by the recent outbreak of encephalitis due to [[West Nile virus]] in the eastern United States.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Epidemiologic factors (e.g., season, geographic location, and the patient’s age, travel history, and possible exposure to animal bites, rodents, and ticks) may help direct the diagnostic workup.

== Transmission and symptoms ==
[[Image:Rabies Virus EM PHIL 1876.JPG|thumb|250px|Micrograph with numerous rabies [[virion]]s (small dark-grey rod-like particles) and [[Negri bodies]], larger [[pathognomonic]] cellular inclusions of rabies infection]] Any mammal may become infected with the rabies virus and develop symptoms, including humans. Most animals can be infected by the virus and can transmit the disease to humans. Infected bats, monkeys, raccoons, foxes, skunks, cattle, wolves, dogs or cats provide the greatest risk to humans. Rabies may also spread through exposure to infected domestic farm animals, groundhogs, weasels and other wild carnivores. Squirrels, rodents and rabbits are seldom infected.

The virus is usually present in the nerves and [[saliva]] of a symptomatic rabid animal.<ref>The ''Merck Manual'', Eleventh Edition (1983), p. 183</ref><ref>''The Merck manual of Medical Information. Second Home Edition'', (2003), p. 484.</ref> The route of [[infection]] is usually, but not necessarily, by a bite. In many cases the affected animal is exceptionally aggressive, may attack without provocation, and exhibits otherwise uncharacteristic behavior[http://www.nda.agric.za/docs/rabies/rabies.htm]. Transmission may also occur via an [[particulate|aerosol]] through [[mucous membrane]]s; transmission in this form may have happened in people exploring caves populated by rabid bats. Transmission between humans is extremely rare, although it can happen through [[organ transplant|transplant surgery]] (see below for recent cases), or, even more rarely, through bites or kisses.

After a typical human infection by bite, the virus directly or indirectly enters the [[peripheral nervous system]]. It then travels along the [[nerve]]s towards the [[central nervous system]]. During this phase, the virus cannot be easily detected within the host, and vaccination may still confer cell-mediated immunity to preempt symptomatic rabies. Once the virus reaches the [[brain]], it rapidly causes [[encephalitis]] and symptoms appear. It may also inflame the [[spinal cord]] producing [[myelitis]].

The period between infection and the first [[flu]]-like symptoms is normally two to twelve weeks, but can be as long as two years. Soon after, the symptoms expand to slight or partial [[paralysis]], [[cerebral dysfunction]], [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[confusion]], [[agitation (emotion)|agitation]], abnormal behavior, [[paranoia]], [[hallucination]]s, progressing to [[delirium]]. The production of large quantities of [[saliva]] and tears coupled with an inability to speak or swallow are typical during the later stages of the disease; this can result in "hydrophobia", where the victim has difficulty swallowing, shows panic when presented with liquids to drink, and cannot quench his or her thirst. The disease itself was also once commonly known as ''[[wiktionary:hydrophobia|hydrophobia]]'', from these characteristic symptoms. Death almost invariably results two to ten days after the first symptoms; the few humans who are known to have survived the disease were all left with severe [[brain damage]], with the recent exception of [[Jeanna Giese]] (see below).

== Prevention ==
There is no known cure for symptomatic rabies, but it can be prevented by [[vaccination]], both in humans and other animals. Virtually every infection with rabies was a death sentence, until [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Emile Roux]] developed the first rabies vaccination in [[1885]]. This vaccine was first used on a human on [[July 6]], [[1885]] &ndash; nine-year old boy [[Joseph Meister]] (1876–1940) had been mauled by a rabid dog.[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0093-0334(197804)8%3A2%3C26%3APWORRT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J] [http://www.zephyrus.co.uk/louispasteur.html]

Their vaccine consisted of a sample of the virus harvested from infected (and necessarily dead) rabbits, which was weakened by allowing it to dry. Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used now in some countries, and while they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines, they are not as effective and carry a certain risk of neurological complications.

The human [[diploid]] cell rabies vaccine (H.D.C.V.) was started in 1967. Human diploid cell rabies vaccines are made using the attenuated Pitman-Moore L503 strain of the virus. Human diploid cell rabies vaccines have been given to more than 1.5 million humans [[as of 2006]]. Newer and less expensive purified chicken embryo cell vaccine, and purified [[Vero cell]] rabies vaccine are now available. The purified Vero cell rabies vaccine uses the attenuated Wistar strain of the rabies virus, and uses the Vero cell line as its host.

===Post-exposure prophylaxis===
Treatment after exposure, known as [[post-exposure prophylaxis]] or "P.E.P.", is highly successful in preventing the disease if administered promptly, within fourteen days after infection. The first step is immediately washing the wound with soap and water, which is very effective at reducing the number of viral particles. In the United States, patients receive one dose of [[immunoglobulin]] and five doses of rabies vaccine over a twenty-eight day period. One-half the dose of immunoglobulin is injected in the region of the bite, if possible, with the remainder injected [[intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] away from the bite. This is much less painful compared with administering immunoglobulin through the [[abdominal wall]] with a large needle, which is how it was done in the past. The first dose of rabies vaccine is given as soon as possible after exposure, with additional doses on days three, seven, fourteen, and twenty-eight after the first. Patients that have previously received pre-exposure vaccination do not receive the immunoglobulin, only the post-exposure vaccinations. Since the widespread vaccination of domestic dogs and cats and the development of effective human vaccines and immunoglobulin treatments, the number of recorded deaths in the U.S. from rabies has dropped from one hundred or more annually in the early twentieth century, to 1&ndash;2 per year, mostly caused by bat bites, which may go unnoticed by the victim and hence untreated.

P.E.P. is effective in treating rabies because the virus must travel from the site of infection through the [[peripheral nervous system]] (nerves in the body) before infecting the [[central nervous system]] (brain and spinal cord) and glands to cause lethal damage. This travel along the nerves is usually slow enough that vaccine and immunoglobulin can be administered to protect the brain and glands from infection. The amount of time this travel requires is dependent on how far the infected area is from the brain: if the victim is bitten in the face, for example, the time between initial infection and infection of the brain is very short and P.E.P. may not be successful.

===Pre-exposure prophylaxis===
Currently pre-exposure [[immunization]] has been used on domesticated and normal non-human populations. In many jurisdictions, domestic dogs, cats, and ferrets are required to be vaccinated. A pre-exposure vaccination is also available for humans, most commonly given to veterinarians and those traveling to regions where the disease is common, such as India. Most tourists do not need such a vaccination, just those doing substantial non-urban activities. However, should a vaccinated human be bitten by a carrier, failure to receive subsequent post-exposure treatment could be fatal, although post-exposure treatment for a vaccinated human is far less extensive than which would normally be required by one with no pre-exposure vaccination.

In 1984 researchers at the [[Wistar Institute]] developed a [[recombinant]] vaccine called V-RG by inserting the [[glycoprotein]] gene from rabies into a [[vaccinia]] virus.<ref name=Wiktor_1984>{{cite journal |author=Wiktor TJ, Macfarlan RI, Reagan KJ, Dietzschold B, Curtis PJ, Wunner WH, Kieny MP, Lathe R, Lecocq JP, Mackett M |title=Protection from rabies by a vaccinia virus recombinant containing the rabies virus glycoprotein gene |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=81 |issue=22 |pages=7194–8 |year=1984 |pmid=6095272}}</ref> The V-RG vaccine has since been commercialised by [[Merial]] under the trademark [http://www.raboral.com/ Raboral]. It is harmless to humans and has been shown to be safe for various species of animals that might accidentally encounter it in the wild, including birds (gulls, hawks, and owls).<ref name=Artois_1990>{{cite journal |author=Artois M, Charlton KM, Tolson ND, Casey GA, Knowles MK, Campbell JB |title=Vaccinia recombinant virus expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein: safety and efficacy trials in Canadian wildlife |journal=Can. J. Vet. Res. |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=504-7 |year=1990 |pmid=2249183}}</ref>

V-RG has been successfully used in the field in [[Belgium]], [[France]], and the [[United States]] to prevent outbreaks of rabies in [[wildlife]]. The virus is stable under relatively high temperatures and can be delivered orally, making mass vaccination of wildlife possible by putting it in tasty baits. The plan for immunization of normal populations involves dropping bait containing food wrapped around a small dose of the live virus. The bait would be dropped by helicopter concentrating on areas that have not been infected yet. Just such a strategy of oral immunization of foxes in Europe has already achieved substantial reductions in the incidence of human rabies. A strategy of vaccinating "neighborhood dogs" in [[Jaipur]], [[India]], (combined with a sterilization program) has also resulted in a large reduction in the number of human cases.<ref name=Reece_2006>{{cite journal | author=Reece JF, Chawla SK. | title=Control of rabies in Jaipur, India, by the sterilisation and vaccination of neighbourhood dogs. | journal=Vet Rec | year=2006 | volume=159 | pages=379&ndash;83 }}</ref>

==Induced coma treatment==
{{main|Jeanna Giese}}

In 2005, the case of Jeanna Giese, a girl of 15 who survived acute, unvaccinated rabies was reported, indicating the successful treatment of rabies through [[induced coma|induction of a coma]].<ref name=Willoughby_2005>{{cite journal |author=Willoughby RE, Tieves KS, Hoffman GM, Ghanayem NS, Amlie-Lefond CM, Schwabe MJ, Chusid MJ, Rupprecht CE |title=Survival after treatment of rabies with induction of coma |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=352 |issue=24 |pages=2508–14 |year=2005 |pmid=15958806}}</ref> This treatment approach was based on the theory that rabies' detrimental effects were caused by temporary dysfunctions of the brain, and that the induction of a coma, by producing a temporary partial stop in brain function, would protect the brain from damage while the body built up an immune response to the virus. After thirty-one days of isolation and seventy-six days of hospitalization, she was released from the hospital, having survived rabies. Later attempts to use the same treatment have failed.

The primary care physician in this case published in the April 2007 issue of ''Scientific American''.<ref name="SciAmApr07">Rodney E. Willoughby, Jr., "A Cure for Rabies?" ''Scientific American'', V. 256, No. 4, April 2007, p. 95 ([http://sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&colID=1&articleID=5BCA4D82-E7F2-99DF-33323DF6FF21871F online link])</ref> He notes that subsequent failures of what he calls the ''Milwaukee protocol'' did not use the cocktail of drugs used during the treatment. A point he makes for future research is the relationship of the virus to depletion of [[biopterin]] in the brain.

== Prevalence ==
[[Image:Rabies Free Countries.svg|thumb|right|300px|Rabies-free jurisdictions, as of January 2006:<br>[[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Fiji]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]]/ROC.]]

More than 99% of all human deaths from rabies occur in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[South America]] and [[India]]; which reports thirty thousand deaths annually.<ref name=WHO_stats>{{cite web | title = Rabies vaccine | work = WHO - Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals | url = http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/rabies.shtml | accessdate = 2006-04-20}}</ref> One of the sources of recent flourishing of rabies in the [[East Asia]] is the pet boom. [[China]] introduced the "[[One-dog policy]]" in November 2006 to control the problem.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/News/article/238729 The Toronto Star "China cracks down on rabid dog menace"]</ref>

The [[English Channel]], dog licensing, killing of stray dogs, muzzling and other measures contributed to the eradication of rabies from the [[United Kingdom]] in the early [[20th century]]. More recently, large-scale vaccination of cats, dogs and ferrets has been successful in combatting rabies in some developed countries.

The rabies virus survives in wide-spread, varied, rural fauna reservoirs. However, in Asia, parts of Latin America and large parts of Africa, dogs remain the principal host. Mandatory vaccination of animals is less effective in rural areas. Especially in developing countries, pets may not be privately kept and their destruction may be unacceptable. Oral vaccines can be safely distributed in baits, and this has successfully reduced rabies in rural areas of [[France]], [[Ontario]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]] and elsewhere. Vaccination campaigns may be expensive, and a cost-benefit analysis can lead those responsible to opt for policies of containment rather than elimination of the disease.

Many territories, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Hawaii]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Guam]], are free of rabies, although there may be a very low prevalence of rabies among bats in the UK; see below.

[[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] have never had rabies.[http://epix.hazard.net/topics/animal/rabies.htm] However, in Australia, the Australian Bat Lyssavirus occurs normally in both insectivorous and fruit eating bats (flying foxes) from most mainland states. Scientists believe it is present in bat populations throughout the range of flying foxes in Australia.

=== Rabies in the United States ===
Rabies was once rare in the [[United States]] outside the [[Southern states]], but [[raccoon]]s in the mid-Atlantic and northeast United States have been suffering from a rabies epidemic since the [[1970s]], which is now moving westwards into [[Ohio]].<ref name=MMWR_2006>{{cite journal | author= | title=Compendium of animal rabies prevention and control, 2006 | journal=MMWR Recomm Rep | year=2006 | pages=1–8 | volume=55 | issue=RR-5 | url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5505a1.htm}}</ref> 
[[Image:Reported l.gif|thumb|right|300px|Cases of animal rabies in the United States in 2001]] The particular variant of the virus has been identified in the southeastern United States raccoon population since the [[1950s]], and is believed to have traveled to the northeast as the result of infected raccoons being among those caught and transported from the southeast to the northeast by human hunters attempting to replenish the declining northeast raccoon population.<ref name=Nettles_1979>{{cite journal | author=Nettles VF, Shaddock JH, Sikes RK, Reyes CR | title=Rabies in translocated raccoons | journal=Am J Public Health | year=1979 | pages=601-2 | volume=69 | issue=6 | pmid = 443502 }}</ref> As a result, urban residents of these areas have become more wary of the large but normally unseen urban raccoon population. It has become the common assumption that any raccoon seen [[diurnal animal|diurnally]] is infected; certainly the reported behavior of most such animals appears to show some sort of illness, and [[autopsy|necropsies]] can confirm rabies. Whether as a result of increased vigilance or only the common human avoidance reaction to any other animal not normally seen, such as a raccoon, there has only been one documented human rabies case as a result of this variant.<ref name=MMWR_2003>{{cite journal|author=Dietzschold, B, Proniak, M|title=First Human Death Associated with Raccoon Rabies --- Virginia, 2003|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=52|issue=45|pages=1102–1103|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|date=2003|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5245a4.htm|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref><ref name=Humane Society_2006>{{cite web|year=2006|title=Rabies and Wildlife|work=The Humane Society of the United States| url=http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/urban_wildlife_our_wild_neighbors/rabies__wildlife.html|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref> This does not include, however, the greatly increasing rate of prophylactic rabies treatments in cases of possible exposure, which numbered fewer than one hundred humans annually in the state of [[New York]] before [[1990]], for instance, but rose to approximately ten thousand annually between [[1990]] and [[1995]]. At approximately $1,500 per course of treatment, this represents a considerable public health expenditure. Raccoons do constitute approximately 50% of the approximately eight thousand documented non-human rabies cases in the United States.<ref name=Krebs_1996>{{cite journal | author=Krebs JW, Strine TW, Smith JS, Noah DL, Rupprecht CE, Childs JE | title=Rabies surveillance in the United States during 1995 | journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc | year=1996 | pages=2031–44 | volume=209 | issue=12 | pmid = 8960176 }}</ref> Domestic animals constitute only 8% of rabies cases, but are increasing at a rapid rate.<ref name=Krebs_1996 /> 

[[Image:Rabid dog.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A rabid dog, with saliva dripping out of the mouth]]
In the midwestern United States, [[skunk]]s are the primary carriers of rabies, composing one hundred and thirty-four of the two hundred and thirty-seven documented non-human cases in [[1996]]. The most widely distributed reservoir of rabies in the United States, however, and the source of most human cases in the U.S., are [[bat]]s. Nineteen of the twenty-two human rabies cases documented in the United States between [[1980]] and [[1997]] have been identified genetically as bat rabies. In many cases, victims are not even aware of having been bitten by a bat, assuming that a small puncture wound found after the fact was the bite of an [[insect]] or [[spider]]; in some cases, no wound at all can be found, leading to the hypothesis that in some cases the virus can be contracted via inhaling airborne [[particulate|aerosols]] from the vicinity of a bat or bats. For instance, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] warned on [[May 9]], [[1997]], that a woman who died in October, [[1996]] in [[Cumberland County, Kentucky]] and a man who died in December, [[1996]] in [[Missoula County, Montana]] were both infected with a rabies strain found in silver-haired bats; although bats were found living in the chimney of the woman's home and near the man's place of employment, neither victim could remember having had any contact with them. This inability to recognize a potential infection, in contrast to a bite from a dog or raccoon, leads to a lack of proper prophylactic treatment, and is the cause of the high mortality rate for bat bites.

==Recently publicized cases==
===Transmission by bite===
Several recently publicized cases have stemmed from [[bat]]s, which are known to be a [[Vector (biology)|vector]] for rabies. See the [[#Rabies and bats|Rabies and bats]] section below. 

In October [[2004]] a female brown [[bear]] killed one human and injured several others near the city of [[Braşov]] in Central [[Romania]]. The bear was killed by human hunters and diagnosed with rabies. More than one hundred humans were vaccinated afterwards.

===Transmission through organ transplants===
Rabies is known to have been transmitted between humans by [[Organ transplant|transplant surgery]]. [[Image:Rabies patient.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A patient with rabies, 1959]]
Infections by [[cornea]]l transplant have been reported in Thailand (2 cases), India (2 cases), Iran (2 cases),<ref name=Javadi_1996>{{cite journal | author=Javadi MA, Fayaz A, Mirdehghan SA, Ainollahi B | title=Transmission of rabies by corneal graft | journal=Cornea | year=1996 | pages=431-3 | volume=15 | issue=4 | id={{PMID|8776570}} }}</ref> the United States (1 case), and France (1 case).<ref>{{cite journal | author = CDC | title = Human-to-human transmission of rabies via a corneal transplant -- France | journal = MMWR | year = 1980 | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 25&ndash;6 | url= }}</ref> Details of two further cases of infection resulting from corneal transplants were described in 1996.

<blockquote>"[The surgeons] thought he had suffered a fatal crack-cocaine overdose, which can produce symptoms similar to those of rabies.

'He'd recently smoked crack cocaine. He'd hemorrhaged around the brain. He'd died. That was all we needed to know'. Because of doctor-patient confidentiality rules, doctors involved with this case would not talk about it on the record, but a few did say that if no cocaine was found in the donor's blood, the E.R. doctors might have investigated his symptoms more aggressively instead of assuming he had overdosed. (Because no autopsy was done, doctors have not been able to establish whether the rabies or the drugs actually killed him.)"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reynolds G | title = Will Any Organ Do? | journal = The New York Times Magazine | year = 2005 | volume = | issue = 10 July | pages = &ndash; | url= }}</ref></blockquote>

In February [[2005]], three [[Germany|German]] patients in [[Mainz]] and [[Heidelberg]] were diagnosed with rabies after receiving various organs and cornea transplants from a female donor. Two of the infected people died. Three other patients who received organs from the woman have not yet shown rabies symptoms. The 26 year old donor had died of heart failure in December 2004 after consuming [[cocaine]] and [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]]. In October 2004, she had visited [[India]], one of the countries worst affected by rabies worldwide. Dozens of medical staff were vaccinated against rabies in the two hospitals as a precautionary measure.

Associated Press reports that "Donated organs are never tested for rabies. The strain detected in the victims' bodies is one commonly found in bats, health officials said." According to CNN "Rabies tests are not routine donor screening tests, Virginia McBride, public health organ donation specialist with the Health Resources and Services Administration, said. The number of tests is limited because doctors have only about six hours from the time a patient is declared brain-dead until the transplantation must begin for the organs to maintain viability." The tragedy caused by the Texarkana donor inspired the episode "[[My Lunch]]" in the American TV show ''[[Scrubs (TV show)|Scrubs]]''.

==Transport of pet animals between countries==
{{main|Pet passport}}

[[Image:Arbroath Rabies Sign.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Sign at a UK port showing rabies prevention measures aimed at merchant seamen]]
Rabies is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to many parts of the world, and one of the reasons given for [[quarantine]] periods in international animal transport has been to try to keep the disease out of uninfected regions. However, most developed countries, pioneered by [[Sweden]], now allow unencumbered travel between their territories for pet animals that have demonstrated an adequate immune response to rabies vaccination.

Such countries may limit movement to animals from countries where rabies is considered to be under control in pet animals. There are various [[lists of countries where rabies in pet animals is under control|lists of such countries]]. The United Kingdom has developed a list, and France has a rather different list, said to be based on a list of the ''Office International des Epizooties'' (OIE). The European Union has a harmonised list. No list of rabies-free countries is readily available from OIE.

However, the recent spread of rabies in the northeastern United States and further may cause a restrengthening of precautions against movement of possibly rabid animals between countries.

==Rabies and dogs==
{{main|Dog health#Rabies}}
Rabies has a long history of association with dogs.  The first written record of rabies is in the the Codex of [[Eshnunna]] (ca. [[20th century BC|1930 BC]]) (written prior to the [[Code of Hammurabi]]), which dictates that the owner of a dog showing symptoms of rabies should take preventative measure against bites.  If a person is bitten by a rabid dog and later died, the owner was fined heavily.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dunlop | first = Robert H. | coauthors = Williams, David J. | title = Veterinary Medicine:An Illustrated History | publisher = Mosby | date = 1996 | id = ISBN 0-8016-3209-9 }}</ref>  

Three stages of rabies are recognized in dogs.  The first stage is a one to three day period characterized by behavioral changes and is known as the [[Prodrome|prodromal stage]].  The second stage is the excitative stage, which lasts three to four days.  It is this stage that is often known as ''furious rabies'' due to the tendency of the affected dog to be hyperreactive to external stimuli and bite at anything near.  The third stage is the paralytic stage and is caused by damage to [[motor neuron]]s.  Incoordination is seen due to rear limb [[paralysis]] and drooling and difficulty swallowing is caused by paralysis of facial and throat muscles.  Death is usually caused by [[respiratory arrest]].<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.;Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th ed.|publisher=W.B.

==Rabies and domestic skunks in the United States==
There is currently no [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]-approved vaccine for the strain of rabies that afflicts skunks. When cases are reported of [[pet skunk]]s biting a human, the animals are frequently killed in order to be [[Rabies testing|tested for rabies]].

Humans exposed to the rabies virus must begin post-exposure prophylaxis before the disease can progress to the central nervous system. For this reason, it is necessary to determine whether the animal, in fact, has rabies as quickly as possible. Without a definitive quarantine period in place for skunks, quarantining the animals is not advised as there is no way of knowing how long it may take the animal to show symptoms. Destruction of the skunk is recommended and the brain is then tested for presence of rabies virus.

Skunk owners have recently organized to campaign for USDA approval of both a vaccine and an officially recommended quarantine period for skunks in the United States.

==Rabies and bats==
The problem of bat-transmitted rabies is found over most of North and South America but was first closely studied in [[Trinidad]] in the [[West Indies]] which had a dreadful reputation for bat rabies, which took a significant toll of livestock and humans alike. In the 10 years from 1925 and 1935, 89 people and thousands of livestock had died from it - "the highest human mortality from rabies-infected bats thus far recorded anywhere.".<ref>Goodwin G. G., and A. M. Greenhall. 1961. "A review of the bats of [[Trinidad and Tobago]]." ''Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History'', 122, p. 196</ref> 

In early 1931, Dr. H. Metivier, a Veterinary surgeon, established the connection between the bites of bats and paralytic rabies. In September 1931, Dr. J. L. Pawan, a Government Bacteriologist found [[Negri bodies]] in the brain of a bat with unusual habits. In 1934 the [[Trinidad and Tobago]] Government began a program of vampire bat control, shooting, netting, trapping and poisoning, while encouraging the screening off of livestock buildings and free vaccination programs for exposed livestock. 

After the opening of the [[Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory]] in 1953, basic research on bats and rabies progressed rapidly under the able direction of Arthur Greenhall, who demonstrated that at least 8 species of bats in Trinidad had been infected with rabies - particularly the [[Common Vampire Bat]], ''Desmodus rotundus'' (which "will attack any warm blooded creature"), the rare [[White-winged Vampire Bat]], ''Diaemus youngi'', (which "appears to have a special preference for birds and goats"), as well as two abundant species of Fruit Bats: the [[Seba's Short-tailed Bat]] or Short-tailed Fruit Bat, ''Carollia perspicillata'', which commonly roosts with Vampires, and the [[Jamaican Fruit Bat]], ''Artibeus jamaicensis''.<ref>Greenhall, Arthur M. 1961. ''Bats in Agriculture''. Ministry of Agriculture, Trinidad and Tobago.</ref>

Non-bite transmission of rabies to susceptible animals placed in bat-proof cages in a cave with bat colonies was demonstrated by Constantine in Frio Cave, Texas, as early as 1960.<ref>Constantine, D. G. 1962. "Rabies transmission by nonbite route." ''Public Health Reports'' 77, pp. 287–289.</ref> In 1967, rabies virus was isolated from the air in the same cave,<ref>Winkler, W. G. 1968. "Airborne Rabies Virus Isolation." ''Bull. Wildlife Disease Assoc''. Vol. 4, April, 1968, pp. 37-40. Available online at: http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/reprint/4/2/37</ref> presumably passed by the bats urinating, potentially forming a source for infection of other susceptible animals, and presenting a hazard to researchers and [[spelunker]]s. While the risks may be low, they are deserving of further study and monitoring.<ref>Messenger, Sharon L., Jean S. Smith, and Charles E. Rupprecht. 2002. "Emerging Epidemiology of Bat-Associated Cryptic Cases of Rabies in Humans in the United States." ''Clinical Infectious Diseases''. 2002; 35, pp. 738–747. Available on line at: [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?id=doi:10.1086/342387&erFrom=-2845139658306756774Guest journals.uchicago.edu]</ref>

The [[United Kingdom]], which has stringent regulations on the importation of animals, had also been believed to be entirely free from rabies until [[1996]] when a single [[Daubenton's bat]] was found to be infected with a rabies-like virus usually found only in bats &ndash; European Bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBL2). There were no more known cases in the [[British Isles]] until [[September 2002]] when another Daubenton's bat tested positive for EBL2 in [[Lancashire]]. A bat conservationist who was bitten by the infected bat received post-exposure treatment and did not develop rabies. 

Then in [[November 2002]] David McRae, a [[Scotland|Scottish]] bat conservationist from [[Guthrie, Angus|Guthrie]], [[Angus]] who was believed to have been bitten by a bat, became the first human to contract rabies in the United Kingdom since [[1902]]. He died from the disease on [[November 24]] [[2002]].

In November [[2004]], [[Jeanna Giese]], a fifteen-year old girl from [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Wisconsin]], became one of only six humans known to have survived rabies after the onset of symptoms, and the first known instance of a human surviving rabies without vaccine treatment.  Giese's disease was already too far progressed for the vaccine to help, and she was considered too weak to tolerate it. Doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]], a suburb of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], achieved her survival with an experimental treatment that involved putting the girl into a drug-induced [[coma]], and administering a cocktail of [[antiviral drug]]s. Giese had symptoms of full-blown rabies when she sought medical help, thirty-seven days after being bitten by a [[bat]]. Her family did not seek treatment at the time because the bat seemed healthy. Jeanna regained her weight, strength, and coordination while in the hospital. She was released from the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin on [[January 1]], [[2005]].

On May 12, 2006 [[Harris County]] Texas. U.S.A. Health Department officials reported that a teenage boy, Zachary Jones of Humble, Texas, had died of rabies at Texas Children's Hospital in [[Houston, Texas]].  Zachary had contracted the disease after a bat flew in his bedroom and bit him in his sleep.  He was unware he had been bitten and was not hospitalized until he developed symptoms several weeks later. He died at Texas Children's Hospital after an attempt to cure the disease through a drug-induced coma, similar to that of Jeanna Giese.

On November 2, 2006 a 10 year old girl in Bourbon, Indiana, U.S.A. died of rabies. The ''Indianapolis Star'' reports that she was bitten by a bat in June 2006.

In August of 2006, a 73 year old rural resident located east of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was bitten by a bat while he slept. He ignored the bite and became symptomatic in January 2007. Diagnosed with rabies in March of 2007, he was treated with the Milwaukee protocol, but died April 26, 2007.

On August 6, 2006, 950 Girl Scouts were urged to receive rabies shots by the Girl Scouts of America. The nine hundred and fifty girls had attended a camp in [[Virginia]], U.S.A. in July, and had reported seeing bats in their cabins. Even though infections were relatively unlikely, the G.S.A. offered to pay for the shots, at a cost of nearly two million dollars. The [[Centers for Disease Control]] reports 27 cases of human rabies caused by the bat variant rabies virus in the United States from 1990 to 2002.<ref name=CDC_2003>{{cite web|year=2003|title=Rabies Surveillance |work=Centers for Disease Control| url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/Professional/publications/Surveillance/Surveillance01/Table2-01.htm
