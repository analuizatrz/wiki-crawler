</ref>) is a former [[Black Panther Party]] [[activist]], cab driver and journalist from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] [[conviction|convicted]] for the [[murder]] of [[police officer]] [[Daniel Faulkner]] in 1981. He is serving a presently undefined [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] of [[imprisonment]] at State Correctional Institution - Greene near [[Waynesburg, Pennsylvania]] in consequence. Originally [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], that sentence was quashed and resentencing ordered in December 2001 by a [[judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]. Both he and the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] have [[appeal (law)|appealed]] the [[court ruling|ruling]] alternately as to the appropriateness of affirming the conviction and that of disaffirming the validity of the original sentence. 

His [[cause celebre|celebrated case]] has received [[international]] attention. Supporters and human rights campaigners variously assert that he is innocent, that the incident in question was a [[Actual innocence|setup]], that he did not receive a [[fair trial]], and/or express their opposition to the possibility of the administration of the [[death penalty]]. Skeptics and opponents assert that he is [[guilt (law)|guilty]], that he received the benefit of [[due process]] and was legitimately [[conviction|convicted]] of murder. Execution proponents among these assert that under Pennsylvania law, his eventual [[judicial execution]] is warranted and mandated by the nature of his crime.<ref>{{cite web

The attention received has spawned [[controversy|controversies]] surrounding [[toponymy|naming of public places]]; his status as an [[Honorary degree|honoree]] of [[municipal]], educational and [[civil society]] organizations; and his engagement as a [[radio host]], [[writer]] and [[commencement speaker]]. During the period of his imprisonment he has continued his activism as a spoken word commentator and as a published author of several works - most notably ''[[Live from Death Row]]''.

<blockquote>1. During the traffic stop, Cook [[assault]]ed Faulkner, who in turn attempted to subdue Cook.<br /> 
2. Abu Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner in the [[back]].<br /> 
3. Faulkner was able to return fire, seriously wounding Abu-Jamal.<br />
4. Abu Jamal then advanced on Faulkner, fired some additional shots at close range, one of which struck Faulkner in the face causing his death.<br />  
5. Abu Jamal was unable to flee due to his own [[gunshot injury|gunshot wound]], and was taken into [[arrest|custody]] by other police officers, who had been summoned by Faulkner at the time of the traffic stop.<br /></blockquote> 

In Abu-Jamal's possession was a [[.38 Special|.38 caliber]] [[revolver]] that records showed he had purchased in 1979. The [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]] of the revolver had five spent [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]]. He was taken directly from the scene of the shooting to a hospital and was treated for his injury. [[Witness]]es, including a [[security guard]] working at the hospital, stated that while Abu-Jamal was receiving medical treatment, he acknowledged that he shot Daniel Faulkner (see [[Mumia Abu-Jamal#"Hospital bed" confession|"Hospital bed" confession]]). 

He was [[indictment|charged]] with [[first-degree murder]]. He initially retained the services of [[Defense (legal)|criminal defense]] [[attorney]] Anthony Jackson. In May 1982 he announced that he would [[Pro se|represent himself]], with Jackson continuing to act as his [[legal advice|legal advisor]]. The [[judge]] initially acquiesced to this but, in time, reversed his attitude of acceptance citing the effect of Abu-Jamal's deemed "disruptive" behavior in the court.<ref>{{cite web

=== Prosecution witnesses at trial ===
Four eyewitnesses to the shooting were produced by the [[prosecution]]:
 
<blockquote>1. Robert Chobert, a [[taxicab|cab]] [[driving|driver]];<br /> 
2. Michael Scanlon, a [[businessman]] who had been visiting from out of town on the night of the killing;<br /> 
3. Cynthia White, a [[prostitute]] who was later revealed to be a [[police informant]];<br />
4. Albert Magilton, a [[pedestrian]]<br /></blockquote>  

These witnesses testified to the effect that they were at the scene at the time of the shooting, and each identified Abu-Jamal as the person who shot Daniel Faulkner.

Other witnesses are recorded as having reported that Abu-Jamal was completely [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] during the time that he was reported to have uttered it.<ref>http://www.freemumia.org/intro.html ''Who is mumia?'' from mumia.org incorporating the statement "Abu-Jamal's doctor said that Abu-Jamal, who was unconscious, said nothing. He reported that a nurse found police with loaded guns pointed at Mumia as he lay unconscious in his hospital bed."</ref> 

The original report of Gary Wakshul, a police officer who confirms to having accompanied him throughout the entire period of his arrest and medical treatment, states that "the negro male made no comments". Officer Wakshul elsewhere later stated that he witnessed Abu-Jamal's utterance of the "hospital bed" confession on the night of the killing, such statement being made almost three months after the arrest and upon the occasion when the prosecutor met with police seeking to test the evidence about Abu-Jamal's alleged utterance of it. Wakshul is recorded as having reasoned that he "didn't think the confession was important" at the time he wrote his original report.{{Citation

This became known as the "running man theory", based on the possibility that a "running man" may have been the actual shooter. Of those witnesses, only Chobert averred to actually witnessing the shooting. He testified that shortly after the shooting he had told police that he had seen Abu-Jamal shoot Daniel Faulkner in the face, and that Abu-Jamal had then run a short distance and collapsed on the sidewalk - himself having also been shot by Faulkner. In other words, Chobert's testimony was that ''Abu-Jamal himself'' was the running man.<ref>{{cite web

=== Witnesses not called at trial ===
{{seealso|Mumia Abu-Jamal legal proceedings#New witnesses}}
Several material and potentially material witnesses were not called to testify at trial. Some were subsequently heard from at post-conviction review hearings in the period 1995-7 or otherwise had their statements incorporated into appeal briefs filed on behalf of Abu-Jamal. 

Abu-Jamal did not testify in his own defense. Regarding this he has explained:<blockquote>"At my trial I was denied the [[right]] to [[self-defense|defend myself]]. I had no confidence in my [[public defender|court-appointed attorney]], who never even asked me what happened the night I was shot and the police officer was killed; and I was excluded from at least half the trial. ''Since I was denied all my rights at my trial I did not testify. I would not be used to make it look like I had a fair trial''."<ref>{{cite web

Abu-Jamal did not state his version of events for the initial [[police]] [[investigation]], nor for almost another 20 years afterwards until subsequent to his third set of [[lawyer]]s offering the 1999 [[affidavit]] of [[Arnold Beverly]]. Beverly purported to [[Confession (legal)|confess]] that he was in fact the person who had shot Daniel Faulkner as part of a [[contract killing]] connected with a desire to keep Faulkner from interfering with [[political corruption|graft and payoffs]] to [[police corruption|corrupt police]].<ref>{{cite web

It further asserts that, upon seeing his brother standing in the street staggering and appearing disoriented Abu-Jamal ran across the street to him and was shot by a uniformed police officer. It also incorporates Abu-Jamal's claim to have been [[torture]]d by the police while he was still in need of medical assistance for his wounds. It concludes with his claim of innocence: {{cquote|"I never said I shot the policeman. I did not shoot the policeman. I never said I hoped he died.

It said Priscilla Durham had testified at Abu-Jamal's trial that when she was working as a security guard at the hospital she heard Abu-Jamal say that he had killed the police officer. When I read this I realized it was a different story from what she had told me.” .. [when I asked her] ..

Bloch, otherwise a supporter of Abu-Jamal's case, stated he came forward after he grew concerned about the [[Character assassination|vilification]] of Daniel Faulkner.
