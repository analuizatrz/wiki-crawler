'''South Woodford''' is a suburb of north-east [[London]] in the [[London Borough of Redbridge]], situated {{convert|8.9|mi|km|1|lk=on}} north-east of [[Charing Cross]]. Together with [[Woodford Green]] and [[Woodford Bridge]] it forms the area known as [[Woodford]], the origins of which date back at least to the [[anglo-saxons|Saxon]] period. It was part of [[Essex]] until [[1965]].

==Amenities==

South Woodford's retail and business area is centred around George Lane &mdash; the main [[high street]] for the district &mdash; and Woodford Green High Road. There are a number of well-known [[chain store]] shops and a good selection of smaller shops, restaurants, cafes, and two post offices, including a royal mail sorting office. 

There is an [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon cinema]] in the High Road, which is the only cinema in the area. Other amenities include a number of green areas, many of which form part of [[Epping Forest]].  

There are numerous churches and chapels representing many Christian denominations, as well as several synagogues and a mosque.

This area was also, until 2004, home to the student residences of [[Queen Mary, University of London]], but the distinctive tower blocks were demolished in 2007 and replaced with lower-rise privately-owned apartments.

==Transport==

George Lane itself is split into two by the [[Central Line]] rail track with the northern part of the road containing the majority of shops and businesses. There was originally a [[level crossing]] at this point, but now a flyover carries traffic between the east and west sides of George Lane.

South Woodford sits at the junction of the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]] with the start of the [[M11 motorway]], which begins at "Charlie Brown's" roundabout. The roundabout is named after a pub/transport café which was demolished when the roundabout was enlarged to accommodate flyover sliproads onto the newly-constructed motorway.

The area is served by [[South Woodford tube station]] in Zone 4 on the [[Central Line]] of the [[London Underground]]. There are many bus routes which connect South Woodford to other parts of London, including the N55 night bus from central London.
