The '''Gbe languages''' ({{pronounced|ɡ͡be}})<ref>The〈gb〉is a [[Labial-velar consonant|voiced labio-velar plosive]], common in many West African languages.</ref> form a cluster of about twenty related [[language]]s stretching across the area between eastern [[Ghana]] and western [[Nigeria]]. The total number of speakers of Gbe languages is between four and eight million. The most widely spoken Gbe language is [[Ewe language|Ewe]] (3 million speakers in Ghana and [[Togo]]), followed by [[Fon language|Fon]] (1.7 million, mainly in [[Benin]]). The Gbe languages belong to the [[Kwa languages|Kwa]] branch of the [[Niger-Congo languages]], and break up into five major dialect clusters: Ewe, Fon, [[Aja language|Aja]], [[Gen language|Gen]], and [[Phla-Pherá languages|Phla-Pherá]].

Most of the Gbe peoples have come from the east to their present dwelling-places in several migrations between the tenth and the fifteenth century. Some of the [[Phla-Pherá languages|Phla-Pherá]] peoples however are thought to be the original inhabitants of the area who have intermingled with the Gbe immigrants, and the Gen people probably are immigrants from the north of Ga or [[Fante]] origin. In the late eighteenth century, many speakers of Gbe were enslaved and transported to the [[New World]], causing Gbe languages to play a role in the genesis of several [[Caribbean]] [[creole language]]s. 

Around 1840, German missionaries started linguistic research into the Gbe languages. In the first half of the twentieth century, the Africanist [[Diedrich Hermann Westermann]] was one of the most prolific contributors to the study of Gbe. The first internal classification of the Gbe languages was published in 1988 by H.B. Capo, followed by a comparative [[phonology]] in 1991. The Gbe languages are [[tonal language|tonal]], [[Isolating language|isolating]] languages and the basic word order is [[Subject Verb Object]].

===Geography and demography===
The Gbe language area is bordered to the west and east by the [[Volta]] river in Ghana and the [[Weme]] river in Nigeria. The northern border is between 6 and 8 degrees [[latitude]] and the southern border is the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. The area is neighbored mainly by other [[Kwa languages]], except for the east and north-east, where [[Yorùbá language|Yorùbá]] is spoken. To the west, [[Ga language|Ga-Dangme]], [[Guang language|Guang]] and [[Akan language|Akan]] are spoken. To the north, it is bordered by [[Adele language|Adele]], Aguna, Akpafu, Lolobi, and Yorùbá.

Estimates of the total number of speakers of Gbe languages vary considerably. Capo (1988) gives a modest estimate of four million, while SIL's [[Ethnologue]] (15th edition, 2005) gives eight million{{inote|number obtained by adding up speaker numbers of all individual Gbe languages}}. The most widely spoken Gbe languages are Ewe ([[Ghana]] and [[Togo]]) and Fon ([[Benin]], eastern Togo) at three million and 1.7 million speakers, respectively. Ewe is a language of formal education for secondary schools and universities in Ghana, and is also used in non-formal education in [[Togo]]. In Benin, Aja (740,000 speakers) and Fon were two of the six national languages selected by the government for adult education in 1992.

===Classification===
[[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]], following Westermann (1952), situated the Gbe languages in the [[Kwa languages|Kwa]] subfamily of the [[Niger-Congo languages]].<ref>Greenberg (1966), ''[[The Languages of Africa]]''.</ref> Though the definition of the Kwa branch has changed through the years, the Gbe languages have always been considered part of it and are currently classified as follows:<ref>First proposed in Stewart (1989), this classification is the one followed by the [[Ethnologue]].</ref>

Many of the Gbe languages are closely related. Based on comparative research, Capo (1988) divides Gbe into five major clusters, where each cluster, far from being a uniform unit, consists of many dialectal varieties. In addition, borders between the clusters are not always distinct. The five major clusters are:<ref>Sources: for the classification, Capo (1991) & Aboh (2004); for speaker numbers, [http://www.ethnologue.com Ethnologue, 15th edition].</ref>

===Naming===
The dialect continuum as a whole was called 'Ewe' by [[Diedrich Hermann Westermann|Westermann]], the most influential writer on the cluster, who used the term 'Standard Ewe' to refer to the written form of the language. Other writers have called the Gbe languages as a whole 'Aja', after the name of the local language of the Aja-Tado area in Benin.  However, use of this single language's name for the language cluster as a whole was not only not acceptable to all speakers but also rather confusing. Since the establishment of a [[working group]] at the West African Languages Congress at [[Cotonou]] in 1980, H. B. Capo's name suggestion has been generally accepted: '' 'Gbe' '', which is the word for 'language/dialect' in each of the languages.<ref>In daily use, individual Gbe languages are referred to by their speakers as X-gbe, e.g. ''Ewegbe'' for Ewe, ''Fongbe'' for Fon, etc.</ref>

==History==
===Before 1600===
[[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], in present day Benin, might be an appropriate starting point for a brief history of the Gbe-speaking peoples. Ewe traditions refer to Ketu as ''[[Amedzofe (history)|Amedzofe]]'' ("origin of humanity") or ''Mawufe'' ("home of the Supreme Being"). It is believed that the inhabitants of Ketu originally belonged to the [[Oyo]] people of Nigeria and were pressed westward by a series of wars between the tenth and the thirteenth century. In Ketu, the ancestors of the Gbe-speaking peoples separated themselves from other refugees and began to establish their own identity.

[[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] attacks between the thirteenth and the fifteenth century drove a large section of the group still further westward. They settled in the ancient kingdom of [[Tado]] (also Stado or Stádó) on the Mono river (in present-day [[Togo]]). The Tado kingdom was an important state in [[West Africa]] up to the late fifteenth century. 

In the course of the thirteenth or fourteenth century, the [[Notsé|Notsie]] (or Notsé, Notsye, Wancé) kingdom was established by emigrants from the Tado kingdom; Notsie would later (around 1500) become the home of another group of migrants from Tado, the [[Ewe people]]. Around 1550, emigrants from Tado established the [[Allada]] (or Alada) kingdom, which became the center of the [[Fon people]]. Tado is also the origin of the [[Aja people]]; in fact, the name Aja-Tado (Adja-Tado) is frequently used to refer to their language.

Other peoples that speak Gbe languages today are the [[Gen people]] (Mina, Ge) around [[Anexo]], who are probably of Ga and [[Fante]] origin, and the [[Phla-Pherá languages|Phla and Pherá]] peoples, some of whom consist of the traditional inhabitants of the area intermingled with early migrants from Tado.<ref>Capo 1991:10; see also the section on linguistic diversity in [[Phla-Pherá languages#Linguistic diversity|Phla-Pherá languages]].</ref>

===European traders and the transatlantic slave trade===
[[Image:Doctrina Christiana - Y explicacion de sus Misterios en nuestro idiom Español, y en lengua Arda (first page).png|thumb|right|300px|First page of the Spanish/Gen version of the [[1658]] ''Doctrina Christiana''.|{{puic|1=Image:Doctrina Christiana - Y explicacion de sus Misterios en nuestro idiom Español, y en lengua Arda (first page).png|log=2007 November 12}}]]
Little is known of the history of the Gbe languages during the time that only Portuguese, Dutch and Danish traders landed on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (roughly 1500 to 1650). The trade of mostly gold and agricultural goods did not exercise much influence on social and cultural structures of the time. No need was felt to investigate the indigenous languages and cultures; the languages generally used in trade at this time were [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Some loanwords  remain from this period, for example ''atrapoe'' 'stairs' from Dutch 'trap' and ''duku'' '(piece of) cloth' from Dutch 'doek' or Danish 'dug'. The few written accounts that stem from this period focus on trade. As more European countries established trade posts in the area, [[missionary|missionaries]] were sent out. As early as 1658, Spanish missionaries translated the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' into the language of [[Allada]], making it one of the earliest texts in any West African language. The Gbe language used in this document is thought to be a somewhat mangled form of [[Gen language|Gen]].<ref>This catechism was reprinted in Labouret & Rivet 1929, who also document the history of the Spanish mission in Allada or Arda.</ref>

The relatively peaceful situation was profoundly changed with the rise of the [[slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]], which reached its peak in the late eighteenth century when as many as 15 000 slaves per year were exported from the area around Benin as part of a [[triangular trade]] between the European mainland, the west coast of Africa and the colonies of the [[New World]] (notably the Caribbean). The main actors in this process were [[Netherlands|Dutch]] (and to a lesser extent [[England|English]]) traders; captives were supplied mostly by cooperating coastal African states. 

The [[Bight of Benin]], which is precisely the area where the Gbe languages are spoken, was one of the centers of the slave trade at the turn of the eighteenth century. The export of 5 % of the population each year resulted in overall population decline. Moreover, since the majority of the exported captives were male, the slave trade led to imbalance in the female/male ratio. In some parts of the [[Slave Coast]] the ratio reached two adult women for every man. Several wars (sometimes deliberately provoked by European powers in order to ''[[divide and rule]]'') further distorted social and economical relations in the area. The lack of earlier linguistic data makes it difficult to trace the inevitable linguistic changes that resulted from this turbulent period.

===Colonisation and onwards===
Around 1850, the transatlantic slave trade had virtually ceased. As the grip of European colonial powers strengthened, slave raiding became prohibited, trading focused on goods once more and the Europeans took it to be their calling to Christianize the colonized parts of Africa. In 1847 the Norddeutsche Missions-Gesellschaft (Bremen) started its work in [[Keta]].

In 1857, the first Ewe grammar, ''Schlüssel der Ewesprache, dargeboten in den Grammatischen Grundzügen des Anlodialekts'', was published by missionary [[J. B. Schlegel]] of the Bremen mission. Five different dialects of Gbe (at that time called the ''Ewé Language-Field'') were already distinguished by Schlegel, notes [[Robert Needham Cust]] in his ''Modern Languages of Africa'' (1883).<ref>Cust, ''The Modern Languages of Africa'', p. 204.</ref> The dialects listed by Cust do not map exactly onto the five subgroups now distinguished by Capo, which is not too surprising since Cust himself admits that he relies on a multitude of often conflicting sources. Fon is in fact listed twice (once as 'the dialect of the province of Dahomé' and once as 'Fogbe'). 

Where previous literature consisted mostly of travel journals sometimes accompanied by short word lists, Schlegel's work marked the beginning of a period of prolific lexicographic and linguistic research into the various Gbe languages. Important writers of this period include [[J.G. Christaller|Christaller]] (''Die Volta-Sprachen-Gruppe'', 1888), [[Ernst Henrici|Henrici]] (''Lehrbuch der Ephe-Sprache'', 1891, actually the first comparative Gbe grammar), [[J. Knüsli|Knüsli]] (''Ewe-German-English Vocabulary'', 1892) and [[Maurice Delafosse|Delafosse]] (''Manuel Dahoméen'' (Fon), 1894).

In 1902 the missionary [[Diedrich Hermann Westermann]] contributed an article titled "Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Yewe-Sprachen in Togo" to ''Zeitschrift für Afrikanische und Oceanische Sprachen''. Westermann was to become one of the most productive and influential writers on the Gbe languages, and his output dominated the Gbe literature and analysis of the first half of the twentieth century. He wrote mainly on the Western Gbe languages, especially on [[Ewe language|Ewe]] (though he often used the term 'Ewe' to denote the Gbe dialect continuum as a whole). Among his most important works on Ewe are his ''A Study of the Ewe language'' (1930) and ''Wörterbuch der Ewe-Sprache'' (1954).

From 1930 on, publications on various Gbe languages have been appearing rapidly, the vast majority of them dealing with individual Gbe languages. A significant exception is formed by the extensive [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] research of Hounkpati B.C. Capo, which resulted in an internal classification of the Gbe languages and in a reconstruction of the proto-Gbe phonology. Much of the comparative research for Capo's classification of the Gbe languages was carried out in the 1970s, and partial results were published in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the form of articles on specific [[phonology|phonological]] developments in various branches of Gbe and, notably, in the form of a unified standard orthography of Gbe. In his ''Renaissance du Gbe'' (1988), the internal classification of Gbe was published in full for the first time. In 1991, Capo published a comparative phonology of Gbe. In this period, Capo also initiated ''Labo Gbe (Int.)'', the 'Laboratory for research on Gbe languages', based in Benin, which has since fostered research and published several collections of papers on the Gbe languages.

In the early 1990s, [[SIL International]] initiated a study to assess which Gbe communities could benefit from existing [[literacy]] efforts and whether additional literacy campaigns in some of the remaining communities would be needed. Synchronised linguistic research carried out in the course of this study shed more light on the relations between the various varieties of Gbe.<ref>Some of the results of this study were presented in Kluge (2000, 2005, 2006).</ref> In general, the SIL studies corroborated many of Capo's findings and led to adjustment of some of his more tentative groupings.

''Notes''<br />
*When symbols appear in pairs, the one to the right represents a voiced consonant except for the trills & approximants rows, where the symbol to the right represents a nasalised consonant.
*The apico-[[postalveolar consonant]]s are generally written and transcribed with the symbols for the corresponding alveolar consonants, except for the voiced stop, which uses the symbol for the voiced retroflex stop {{IPA|[ɖ]}}. This is only to distinguish from the lamino-dental voiced stop, and is not to be interpreted as the consonant being [[Sub-apical consonant|subapical]].
* The above table lists the attested ''phonetic'' segments. Some of the sounds listed here are in [[free variation]] with other sounds (e.g., '''r''' and '''r̃''' with '''l''' and '''l̃'''). The reader is referred to the individual languages for an overview of their phoneme inventory.

No Gbe language exhibits all of the above forty-two phonetic segments. According to Capo (1991), all of them have the following twenty-three consonants in common: '''b, m, t, d, ɖ, n, k, g, kp, gb, ɲ, f, v, s, z, χ, ʁ, r, r̃, l, l̃, y, w'''.

====Vowels====
The following vowels are found in Gbe languages:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ <small>Phonetic inventory of vowels in Gbe languages</small>

|-
|style="text-align: right;"|[[Open vowel|Open]]|| || a • ã ||
|}

It should be noted that none of the Gbe languages has all of the above sixteen vowel qualities. In general, each Gbe lect makes use of a subset of fourteen vowels, seven [[Oral vowel|oral]] and seven [[Nasal vowel|nasalised]]. The vowels '''i ĩ u ũ e o ɛ̃ &#596; &#596;̃ a ã''' are attested in all Gbe languages. 

Nasality plays an important role in the Gbe vowel inventory: every vowel in a Gbe language occurs in a non-nasalized and a nasalized form. Capo (1991) observes that the degree of nasality of nasal vowels is less when they occur after nasal consonants than after non-nasal ones.

====Nasality in Gbe====
Capo (1981) has argued that nasality in Gbe languages should be analysed phonemically as a feature relevant to vowels and not to consonants.<ref>Cf. Capo (1981).</ref> This means that underlying nasal vowels are recognized, while nasal consonants are treated as merely predictable variants of their non-nasal counterparts. For example, non-syllabic nasal consonants are always followed by a nasal vowel, and syllabic nasal consonants are analysed as reduced forms of consonant-vowel syllables. This analysis is in line with reconstructions of the [[Protolanguage|proto]]-[[Volta-Congo]] language, for which similar proposals have been made.<ref>Cf. Stewart, John (1985) 'Nasality patterns in the Volta-Congo foot.' Paper presented at the Colloquium on African Linguistics, Leiden, Sept. 1985.</ref>

====Tone====
The Gbe languages are [[tonal language]]s. In general, they have three tone levels, High (H), Mid (M), and Low (L), of which the lower two are not phonemically contrastive. Thus, the basic tonemes of Gbe are 'High' and 'Non-High', where the High toneme may be realised as High or Rising and the Non-High toneme may be realised as Low or Mid.  The tones of Gbe [[noun]]s are often affected by the [[consonant]] of the noun stem. The [[phonation|voicing]] of this consonant affects the realisation of the Non-High toneme roughly as follows: If the consonant is a voiced [[obstruent]], the Non-High toneme is realised as Low (è-ḏà 'snake') and if the consonant is a voiceless obstruent or a [[sonorant]], the Non-High toneme is realised as Mid (ām̲ē 'person', á-f̱ī 'mouse'). The consonants that induce tonal alternations in this way are sometimes called [[depressor consonant]]s.

===Morphology===
The basic [[syllable]] form of Gbe languages is commonly rendered (C₁)(C₂)V(C₃), meaning that there at least has to be a nucleus V, and that there are various possible configurations of consonants (C₁₋₃). The V position may be filled by any of the vowels or by a syllabic nasal. It is also the location of the tone. While virtually any consonant can occur in the C₁ position, there exist several restrictions on the kind of consonants that can occur in the C₂ and C₃ positions. In general, only [[liquid consonants]] may occur as C₂, while only nasals occur in the C₃ position. 

Most [[verb]]s in Gbe languages have one of the basic syllable forms. Gbe [[noun|nominals]] are generally preceded by a nominal prefix consisting of a vowel (cf. the Ewe word ''aɖú'', 'tooth'). The quality of this vowel is restricted to the subset of non-nasal vowels. In some cases the nominal prefix is reduced to [[schwa]] or lost: the word for 'fire' is ''izo'' in Phelá, ''əʤo'' in Wací-Ewe and ''ʤo'' in Pecí-Ewe. The nominal prefix can be seen as a relic of a typical Niger-Congo [[noun class]] system.

The Gbe languages are [[isolating language]]s, and as such express many semantic features by lexical items. Of a more [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] nature are the commonly used [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] constructions. In contrast to [[Bantu languages]], a major branch of the Niger-Congo language family, Gbe languages have very little inflectional morphology. There is for example no subject-verb [[agreement]] whatsoever in Gbe, no [[gender]] agreement, and no inflection of nouns for number. The Gbe languages make extensive use of a rich system of tense/aspect markers.

[[Reduplication]] is a morphological process in which the root or stem of a word, or part of it, is repeated. The Gbe languages, like most other [[Kwa languages]], make extensive use of reduplication in the formation of new words, especially in deriving nouns, adjectives and adverbs from verbs. Thus in Ewe, the verb ''lã́'', 'to cut', is nominalised by reduplication, yielding ''lãlã́'', 'the act of cutting'. Triplication is used to intensify the meaning of adjectives and adverbs, e.g. Ewe ''ko'' 'only' > ''kokooko'' 'only, only, only'.

===Syntax===
The basic word order of Gbe clauses is generally [[Subject Verb Object]], except in the imperfective tense and some related constructions{{Inote|Cf. Aboh (2004)}}. The Gbe languages, notably Ewe, Fon and Anlo, played a role in the genesis of several [[Caribbean]] creole languages &mdash; [[Haitian Creole]] for example is classifiable as having a [[French language|French]] vocabulary with the syntax of a Gbe language.<ref>Lefebvre (1985). A recent research project of the Leiden-based Research School [[CNWS]] on this topic concerns the relation between Gbe and [[Surinam]]ese creole languages. The project is titled ''A trans-Atlantic [[Sprachbund]]? The structural relationship between the Gbe-languages of West Africa and the Surinamese creole languages''.</ref>

The Gbe languages do not lend much support to the traditional distinction between tense and aspect. The only [[Grammatical tense|tense]] that is expressed by a simple morphological marker in Gbe languages is the ''future tense''. The future marker is ''ná'' or ''a'', as can be seen from the examples below.
Other tenses are arrived at by means of special time adverbs or by inference from the context, and this is where the tense/aspect distinction becomes blurred. For example, what is sometimes referred to as ''perfective aspect'' in Gbe blends with the notion of past tense since it expresses an event with a definite endpoint, ''located in the past'' (see example sentences below).
* ŋútsu á '''a''' ɸlè xéxí &nbsp; (man <small>DET FUT</small> buy umbrella) &nbsp;  ''the man will buy an umbrella'' &nbsp; (Ewegbe, future marker)
* ŋútsu á ɸlè xéxí &nbsp; (man <small>DET</small> buy:<small>PERF</small> umbrella) &nbsp; ''the man bought an umbrella'' &nbsp; (Ewegbe, perfective)

[[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]], which is used to draw attention to a particular part of the utterance, to signify contrast or to emphasize something, is expressed in Gbe languages by leftward movement of the focused element and by way of a focus marker ''wɛ́'' (Gungbe, Fongbe), ''yé'' (Gengbe) or ''é'' (Ewegbe), suffixed to the focused element. 
* àxwé '''yé''' Kòfí tù &nbsp; (house <small>FOC</small> Kofi build:<small>PERF</small>) &nbsp; ''Kofi built A HOUSE'' &nbsp; (Gengbe, focus) {{Inote|Source: Aboh (2004)}}

[[Question]]s can be constructed in various ways in Gbe languages. A simple declarative sentence can be turned into an interrogative utterance by the use of the question marker ''à'' at the end of the sentence. Another way of forming questions is by using question words. These so-called ''question word questions'' are much akin to focus constructions in Gbe. The question word is found at the beginning of the sentence, as is the focus marker. The close relationship to focus is also clear from the fact that in Gbe, a sentence cannot contain a question word and a focused element simultaneously.
* Afua de Gɛ '''à'''? &nbsp; (Afua reach:<small>PERF</small> Gɛ <small>QUESTION</small>) &nbsp; ''Did Afua go to Accra?'' &nbsp; (Ewegbe, question)
* '''étɛ́''' Sɛ́ná xìá? &nbsp; (what Sena read:<small>PERF</small>) &nbsp; ''What did Sena read?'' (Gungbe, question word question) {{Inote|Source: Aboh (2004)}}

[[Topic (linguistics)|Topicalization]], the signalling of the subject that is being talked about, is achieved in Gbe languages by the move of the topicalized element to the beginning of the sentence. In some Gbe languages, a topic marker is suffixed to the topicalized element. In other Gbe languages the topic has to be ''definite''. A topicalized element precedes the focused element in a sentence containing both.
* ...ɖɔ̀ '''dàn ɔ́''', Kòfí wɛ̀ hùì &nbsp; (that snake <small>DET</small> Kofi <small>FOC</small> kill:<small>PERF</small>-it) &nbsp; ''...that the snake, KOFI killed it'' &nbsp; (Fongbe, topic) {{Inote|Source: Aboh (2004)}}

[[Negation]] is expressed in various ways in the Gbe languages. In general, three methods of negation can be distinguished: Languages like Gungbe express negation by a preverbal marker ''má''; Fongbe-type languages express negation either like Gungbe, or with a sentence-final marker ''ã''; and languages like Ewegbe require both the preverbal marker ''mé'' and a sentence-final marker ''o''.

Gbe languages share an [[areal feature]] found in many languages of the Volta basin, the [[serial verb construction]]. This means that two or more verbs can be juxtaposed in one clause, sharing the same subject, lacking conjunctive markings, resulting in a meaning that expresses the consecutive or simultaneous aspect of the actions of the verbs. 
* Kofí '''trɔ dzo''' kpoo &nbsp; (Kofi turn:<small>PERF</small> leave:<small>PERF</small> quietly) &nbsp; ''Kofi turned and left quietly'' &nbsp; (Ewegbe, serial verb construction)
