Quebec is [[Canada]]'s largest province by area and its second-largest [[Canada#Administrative divisions|administrative division]]; only the territory of [[Nunavut]] is larger. It is bordered to the west by the province of [[Ontario]], [[James Bay]] and [[Hudson Bay]], to the north by [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Ungava Bay]], to the east by the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the provinces of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[New Brunswick]]. It is bordered on the south by the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]], and [[New York]]. It also shares maritime borders with [[Nunavut]], [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Nova Scotia]].

Quebec is the second most populous province, after Ontario. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the [[Saint Lawrence River]] between [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]], the capital. [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking communities]] and English-language institutions are concentrated in Montreal but are also significantly present in the [[Outaouais region|Outaouais]], the [[Eastern Townships]], and [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspé]] regions. The [[Nord-du-Québec]] region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CD&Code1=2499&Geo2=PR&Code2=24&Data=Count&SearchText=Nord-du-Qu%E9bec&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=24&B1=All&Custom=|title=Community highlights for Nord-du-Québec|year=2006|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref>.

While the province's substantial [[natural resources]] have long been the mainstay of its economy, sectors of the [[knowledge economy]] such as [[aerospace]], information and communication technologies, [[biotechnology]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]] also play leading roles<ref>{{cite web|last=Poitras|first=François |title=Regional Economies Special Report Micro-Economic Policy Analysis|publisher=Industry Canada |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/eas-aes.nsf/vwapj/srreo200401e.PDF/$FILE/srreo200401e.PDF|format=PDF|date=2004-01|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref>.

==Etymology and boundary changes==
[[Image:Samuel de champlain.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Samuel de Champlain]], Father of [[New France]]]]
The name "Quebec", which comes from the [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] word '''kepék''' meaning "(it) narrows", originally referred to the area around the Quebec City where the Saint Lawrence River narrows to a cliff-lined gap. Early variations in the spelling of the name included ''Québecq'' (Levasseur, 1601) and ''Kébec'' (Lescarbot 1609)<ref>Afable, Patricia O. and Madison S. Beeler (1996). "Place Names". In "Languages", ed. Ives Goddard. Vol. 17 of ''Handbook of North American Indians'', ed. William C. Sturtevant. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 191</ref>. French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] chose the name ''Québec'' in 1608 for the colonial outpost he would use as the administrative seat for the French colony of [[New France]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpContent.html&series_id=1&episode_id=2&chapter_id=4&page_id=4&lang=E | title = Canada: A People's History – The birth of Quebec | publisher = Canadian Broadcast Corporation|year=2001 | accessdate = 2006-08-26}}</ref>.

The [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] was founded in the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] formally transferred the [[French colonial empires|French colony]] of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]<ref>"his Most Christian Majesty cedes and guaranties to his said Britannick Majesty, in full right, Canada, with all its dependencies, as well as the island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts in the gulph and river of St. Lawrence, and in general, every thing that depends on the said countries, lands, islands, and coasts, with the sovereignty, property, possession, and all rights acquired by treaty, or otherwise, which the Most Christian King and the Crown of France have had till now over the said countries, lands, islands, places, coasts, and their inhabitants" – [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_%281763%29 ''Treaty of Paris''], 1763</ref> to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] after the [[Seven Years' War]]. The proclamation restricted the province to an area along the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 restored the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Ohio River]] Valley regions to the province. The [[Treaty of Versailles, 1783]] ceded territories south of the Great Lakes to the [[United States]]. After the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the territory was divided between [[Lower Canada]] (present day Quebec) and [[Upper Canada]] (present day Ontario), with each being granted an elected [[Legislative Assembly]]. In 1840, these become [[Canada East]] and [[Canada West]] after the British Parliament unified Upper and Lower Canada into the [[Province of Canada]]. This territory was redivided into the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario at [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867. Each became one of the first four provinces.

In 1870, Canada purchased [[Rupert's Land]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Over the next few decades the [[Parliament of Canada]] transferred portions of this territory to Quebec that more than tripled the size of the province<ref>[[Parliament of Canada|Library of the Parliament of Canada]], [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp412-e.htm#B].</ref>. In 1898, the Canadian Parliament passed the first [[Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898|Quebec Boundary Extension Act]] that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the [[Cree]]. This was followed by the addition of the [[District of Ungava]] through the [[Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912|Quebec Boundaries Extension Act of 1912]] that added the northernmost lands of the aboriginal [[Inuit]] to create the modern Province of Quebec. In 1927, the border between Quebec and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] was established by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. Quebec [[Labrador#The Labrador boundary dispute|officially disputes this boundary]].

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Quebec}}
[[Image:Map of Quebec (English).png|right|200px|thumb|Map of Quebec.]]
[[Image:Quebec SPOT 1035.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Quebec city seen from Spot Satellite]]
The province occupies a vast territory (nearly three times the size of [[France]] or [[Texas]]), most of which is very sparsely populated. Quebec's highest point is [[Mount Caubvik|Mont D'Iberville]], located on the border with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in the northeastern part of the province.

The Saint Lawrence River is one of the world's largest sustaining large inland [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] ports at Montreal (the province's largest city), [[Trois-Rivières]], and Quebec City (the capital). Its access to the Atlantic Ocean and the interior of North America made it the base of early [[French colonization of the Americas|French exploration and settlement]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Since 1959, the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] has provided a navigable link between the Atlantic Ocean and Great Lakes. Northeast of Quebec City, the river broadens into the world's largest [[estuary]], the feeding site of numerous species of whales, fishes and sea birds<ref>{{cite web |title=Saguenay-St. Lawrence National Park |url=http://www.greatcanadianparks.com/quebec/saguenp/index.htm}}</ref>. The river empties into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. This marine environment sustains fisheries and smaller ports in the [[Bas-Saint-Laurent|Lower Saint Lawrence]] (''Bas-Saint-Laurent''), [[Côte-Nord|Lower North Shore]] (''Côte-Nord''), and [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspé]] (Gaspésie) regions of the province.

[[Image:Monteregian Hills from space.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Satellite view of three [[Monteregian Hills]] in [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]].]]
The most populous [[physiographic]] region is the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]]. It extends northeastward from the southwestern portion of the province along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River to the Quebec City region, and includes [[Anticosti Island]], the Mingnan Archipelago<ref>{{cite web| title = Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve of Canada | publisher = Parks Canada | url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/qc/mingan/index_e.asp | date = 2008-05-02 | accessdate = 2008-05-15}}</ref> and other small islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence<ref name=NAC>{{cite web | title = Borderlands / St. Lawrence Lowlands | work = The Atlas of Canada | publisher = Natural Resources Canada | date = 2006-10-25 | url = http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/land/st_lawrence_lowlands.html | format = html | accessdate = 2008-04-28}}</ref>. Its landscape is low-lying and flat, except for isolated [[igneous]] outcrops near Montreal called the [[Monteregian Hills]]. Geologically, the lowlands formed as a [[rift valley]] about 100 million years ago and are prone to infrequent but significant earthquakes<ref name=Elson>{{cite web | last = Elson | first = J.A. | title = St Lawrence Lowland | work = Canadian Encyclopedia | publisher = Historica Foundation | url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0007093 | format = html | accessdate = 2008-04-28}}</ref>. The most recent layers of [[sedimentary rock]] were formed as the seabed of the ancient [[Champlain Sea]] at the end of the last ice age about 14,000 years ago<ref>{{cite web | last = Lasalle | first = Pierre | coauthors = Robert J.

The combination of rich and easily arable soils and Quebec's warmest climate make the valley Quebec's most prolific agricultural area. [[Mixedwood Plains|Mixed forests]] provide most of Canada's [[maple syrup]] crop every spring. The rural part of the landscape is divided into narrow rectangular tracts of land that extend from the river and date back to [[Seigneurial system of New France|settlement patterns in 17th century New France]].

[[Image:LG2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Robert-Bourassa Dam, part of [[James Bay Project]] on [[Canadian Shield]].]]
More than 90% of Quebec's territory lies within the [[Canadian Shield]], a rough, rocky terrain sculpted and scraped clean of soil by successive [[ice ages]]. It is rich in the forestry, mineral and hydro-electric resources that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy. [[Primary industries]] sustain small cities in regions of [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue]], [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]], and [[Côte-Nord]]. In the [[Labrador Peninsula]] portion of the Shield, the far northern region of [[Nunavik]] includes the [[Ungava Peninsula]] and consists of [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] inhabited mostly by the [[Inuit]]. Further south lie [[subarctic]] [[taiga]] and [[boreal forest]], where [[spruce]], [[fir]], and [[poplar]] trees provide raw materials for Quebec's [[Pulp and paper industry in Canada|pulp and paper]] and [[lumber]] industries. Although inhabited principally by the [[Grand Council of the Crees|Cree]], [[Naskapi]], and [[Innu]] [[First Nations]], thousands of temporary workers reside at [[Radisson, Quebec|Radisson]] to service the massive [[James Bay Hydroelectric Project]] on the [[La Grande River|La Grande]] and [[Eastmain River|Eastmain]] rivers. The southern portion of the shield extends to the [[Laurentian mountains|Laurentians]], a mountain range just north of Montreal and Quebec City that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts.

The [[mixed forests]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] flank the eastern portion of the province, extending from [[New England]] into the [[Eastern Townships]], northeastward through the [[Beauce, Quebec|Beauce]] region, and on to the [[Gaspé Peninsula]], where they disappear into the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]]. This region sustains a mix of forestry, industry, and tourism based on its natural resources and landscape.

===Climate===
Quebec has three main climate regions. Southern and western Quebec, including most of the major population centres, have a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with warm, humid summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The main climatic influences are from western and northern Canada which move eastward and from the southern and central United States that move northward. Because of the influence of both storm systems from the core of [[North America]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], precipitation is abundant throughout the year, with most areas receiving more than 100&nbsp;centimetres(40 in) of precipitation, including over 300&nbsp;centimetres (120 in) of snow in many areas. During the summer, severe weather patterns (such as [[tornado]]es and [[severe thunderstorm]]s) occasionally occur.

Most of central Quebec has a [[subarctic climate]] (Köppen ''Dfc''). Winters are long and among the coldest in eastern Canada, while summers are warm but very short because of the higher latitude and the greater influence of Arctic air masses. Precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south, except at some of the higher elevations.

The northern regions of Quebec have an [[arctic climate]] (Köppen ''ET''), with very cold winters and short, much cooler summers. The primary influences in this region are the Arctic Ocean currents (such as the [[Labrador Current]]) and continental air masses from the [[High Arctic]].

==History==
{{main|History of Quebec}}
===First Nations===
At the time of first European contact and later colonization, [[Algonquian language|Algonquian]], [[Iroquoian language|Iroquoian]] and [[Inuit]] groups were the peoples that inhabited what is now Quebec. Their lifestyles and cultures reflected the land on which they lived. Seven Algonquian groups lived [[nomad]]ic lives based on hunting, gathering, and fishing in the rugged terrain of the Canadian Shield: (James Bay Cree, [[Innu]], [[Algonquin]]s) and Appalachian Mountains ([[Mi'kmaq]], [[Western Abenaki|Abenaki]]). [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]] lived more settled lives, planting squash and maize in the fertile soils of St. Lawrence Valley. The Inuit continue to fish and hunt whale and seal in the harsh Arctic climate along the coasts of Hudson and Ungava Bay. These people traded fur and food and sometimes warred with each other.

===Early European exploration===
[[Basque people|Basque]] whalers and fishermen traded furs with Saguenay natives throughout the 16th century<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0000550 Basques], The Canadian Encyclopedia</ref>.

The first French [[List of explorers|explorer]] to reach Quebec was [[Jacques Cartier]], who planted a cross in 1534 at either [[Gaspé]] or at [[Old Fort Bay]] on the [[Lower North Shore]]. He sailed into the St. Lawrence River in 1535 and established an ill-fated colony near present-day Quebec City at the site of [[Stadacona]], an Iroquoian village.

===New France===
{{main|New France}}
[[Samuel de Champlain]] was part of a 1603 expedition from France that travelled into the St. Lawrence River. In 1608, he returned as head of an exploration party and founded Quebec City with the intention of making the area part of the [[French colonial empire]]. Champlain's ''Habitation de Quebec'', built as a permanent fur trading outpost, was where he would forge a trading, and ultimately a [[military]] alliance, with the [[Algonquin]] and [[Huron]] nations. Natives traded their furs for many French goods such as metal objects, guns, alcohol, and clothing.

[[Helen Desportes|Hélène Desportes]], born July 7, 1620, to the [[French people|French]] [[habitants]] (settlers) Pierre Desportes and his wife Françoise Langlois, was the first child of [[European ethnic groups|European descent]] born in Quebec.

From Quebec, [[coureurs des bois]], [[coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageurs]] and Catholic missionaries used river [[canoe]]s to explore the interior of the North American continent, establishing fur trading forts on the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Étienne Brûlé]] 1615), [[Hudson Bay]] ([[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] and [[Médard des Groseilliers|Groseilliers]] 1659–60), [[Ohio River]] and [[Mississippi River]] ([[Robert Cavelier de La Salle|La Salle]] 1682), as well as the [[Prairie River]] and [[Missouri River]] ([[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de la Vérendrye|de la Verendrye]] 1734–1738).

After 1627, King [[Louis XIII of France]] introduced the [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]] and forbade settlement in [[New France]] by anyone other than [[Roman Catholic]]s. [[Sulpician]] and [[Jesuit]] clerics founded missions in [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]] (Laviolette) and Montréal or Ville-Marie ([[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]] and [[Jeanne Mance]]) to convert [[New France]]'s [[Huron]] and [[Algonkian]] allies to [[Catholicism]]. The seigneurial system of governing New France also encouraged immigration from the motherland.

New France became a Royal Province in 1663 under King [[Louis XIV of France]] with a [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]] that included [[intendant of New France|intendant]] [[Jean Talon]]. This ushered in a golden era of [[French colonization of the Americas|settlement and colonization]] in New France, including the arrival of les "[[Filles du Roi]]". The population grew from about 3,000 to 60,000 people between 1666 and 1760<ref>[http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/98-187-XIE/pop.htm Estimated population of Canada, 1605 to present]</ref>. Colonists built farms on the banks of St. Lawrence River and called themselves "[[Canadiens]]" or "[[Habitants]]". The colony's total population was limited, however, by a winter climate significantly harsher than that found in France; by the spread of diseases; and by the refusal of the French crown to allow [[Huguenots]], or French Protestants, to settle there. The population of New France lagged far behind that of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south, leaving it vulnerable to attack.

===The [[Seven Years' War]] / Capitulation of [[New France]] ===
In 1753 France began building a series of forts in the British [[Ohio Country]]. They refused to leave after being notified by the British Governor, and in 1754 [[George Washington]] launched an attack on the French [[Fort Duquesne]] (now [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]) in the Ohio Valley in an attempt to enforce the British claim to the territory. This frontier battle set the stage for the [[French and Indian War]] in North America. By 1756, France and Britain were battling the [[Seven Years' War]] worldwide. In 1758, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] mounted an attack on New France by sea and took the French fort at [[Louisbourg]].

On September 13, 1759, General [[James Wolfe]] defeated General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] on the [[Plains of Abraham]] outside Quebec City. With the exception of the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], located off the coast of Newfoundland, France ceded its North American possessions to Great Britain through the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]. By the [[British Royal Proclamation of 1763]], Canada (part of New France) was renamed the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]].

=== [[The Quebec Act]] ===

In 1774, fearful that the French-speaking population of Quebec (as the colony was called) would side with the rebels of the Thirteen Colonies to the south, the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]] giving recognition to French law, Catholic religion and French language in the colony; before that Catholics had been excluded from public office and recruitment of priests and brothers forbidden, effectively shutting down Quebec's schools and colleges. The first British policy of assimilation (1763–1774) was deemed a failure. Both the petitions and demands of the Canadiens' élites, and Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], played an important role in convincing London to drop the assimilation scheme, but the looming American revolt was certainly a factor. Through the Quebec Act, the Quebec people obtained their first Charter of Rights, which paved the way to later official recognition of the French language and [[French culture]]. The act allowed ''Canadiens'' to maintain French [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and sanctioned freedom of religion, allowing the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to remain. It also restored the Ohio Valley to Quebec, reserving the territory for the fur trade.

The act, designed to placate one North American colony, had the opposite effect among its neighbors to the south. The Quebec Act was among the [[Intolerable Acts]] that infuriated American colonists, who launched the [[American Revolution]]. A [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|1775 invasion]] by the American [[Continental Army]] met with early success but was later repelled at the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|battle at Quebec City]].

=== Quebec during the American Revolutionary War ===
On June 27th 1775, General George Washington decided to lead an American incursion in an attempt to wrest Quebec and the St. Lawrence River from the British. Arnold led 1,100 soldiers from Massachusetts to Maine, then up the Kennebec and Dead Rivers into the Province of Quebec by way of the Chaudiere River to Quebec City.

When the American army came to Quebec they found only a minority of supporters. The invasion failed.

At the end of the war, 50,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] came to Canada and settled amongst a population of 90,000 French people. Many American loyalist refugees settled into the Eastern Townships of Quebec, in the area of Sherbrooke, Drummondville and Lennoxville.

The [[American Revolutionary War]] was ultimately successful in winning independence for the Thirteen Colonies. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], the British ceded their territory south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States of America.

=== ''Patriotes''' Rebellion in Lower and Upper Canada ===
{{main|Lower Canada Rebellion}}
Like their counterparts in [[Upper Canada]], in 1837 English and French speaking residents of Lower Canada, led by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and [[Robert Nelson]], formed an armed resistance group to seek an end to British colonial rule. They made a Declaration of Rights with equality for all citizens without discrimination and a Declaration of Independence in 1838. Their actions resulted in rebellions in both Lower and Upper Canada. An unprepared [[British Army]] had to raise a local [[militia]] force, and the rebel forces were soon defeated after having scored a victory in [[Saint-Denis, Quebec]], east of Montreal. The British army also burned the Church of St-Eustache, killing the rebels who were hiding within it. The bullet and cannonball marks on the walls of the church are still visible to this day.

=== Act of Union ===
After the rebellions, [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was asked to undertake a study and prepare a [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|report]] on the matter and to offer a solution for the British Parliament to assess.

The final report recommended that the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada be united, and that the French speaking population of Lower Canada be assimilated into British culture. Following Durham's [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|Report]], the British government merged the two colonial provinces into one [[Province of Canada]] in 1840 with the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]].

However, the political union proved contentious. Reformers in both Canada West (formerly Upper Canada) and Canada East (formerly Lower Canada) worked to repeal limitations on the use of the French language in the Legislature. The two colonies remained distinct in administration, election, and law.

In 1848, Baldwin and LaFontaine, allies and leaders of the Reformist party, were asked by [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] to form an administration together under the new policy of [[responsible government]]. The French language subsequently regained legal status in the Legislature.

=== Canadian Confederation ===
In the 1860s, the delegates from the colonies of [[British North America]] (Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland) met in a series of conferences to discuss self-governing status for a new confederation.

The first [[Charlottetown Conference]] took place in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]] followed by the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] in Quebec City which led to a delegation going to [[London]], [[England]], to put forth a proposal for a national union.

As a result of those deliberations, in 1867 the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed the [[British North America Act]], providing for the Confederation of most of these provinces.

The former [[Province of Canada]] was divided into its two previous parts as the provinces of [[Ontario]] (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada).
* [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] joined Ontario and Quebec in the new [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]].
* [[Prince Edward Island]] joined in 1873 and the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] entered the Confederation in 1949.

=== Quiet Revolution ===
{{main|Quiet Revolution}}
The [[conservatism|conservative]] government of [[Maurice Duplessis]] and his [[Union Nationale (Canada)|Union Nationale]] dominated Quebec politics from 1944 to 1960 with the support of the [[Roman Catholic]] church. [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]] and other liberals formed an intellectual opposition to Duplessis's regime, setting the groundwork for the [[Quiet Revolution]] under [[Jean Lesage]]'s [[Parti libéral du Québec|Liberals]]. The Quiet Revolution was a period of dramatic social and political change that saw the decline of Anglo supremacy in the Quebec economy, the decline of the Roman Catholic Church's influence, the [[nationalization]] of [[hydro-electric]] companies under [[Hydro-Québec]] and the emergence of a [[Quebec sovereignty movement|pro-sovereignty movement]] under former Liberal minister [[René Lévesque]].

==== Front de libération du Québec ====
{{main|Front de libération du Québec}}
Beginning in 1963, a [[terrorism|terrorist]] group that became known as the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) launched a decade of bombings, robberies and attacks<ref name=FLQ>[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0003082 Front de libération du Québec] from the [[Canadian Encyclopedia]]</ref> directed primarily at English institutions, resulting in at least five deaths. In 1970, their activities culminated in events referred to as the [[October Crisis]]<ref>http://www.mcgill.ca/maritimelaw/history/crisis/</ref> when [[James Cross]], the British trade commissioner to Canada, was kidnapped along with [[Pierre Laporte]], a provincial minister and Vice-Premier. Laporte was was strangled with his own rosary beads a few days later. In their published Manifesto, the terrorists stated: "In the coming year [[Robert Bourassa|Bourassa]] will have to face reality; 100,000 revolutionary workers, armed and organized."

At the request of Premier Robert Bourassa, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] invoked the [[War Measures Act]]. In addition, the Quebec [[Ombudsman]]<ref>http://www.protecteurducitoyen.qc.ca/en/index.asp</ref> Louis Marceau was instructed to hear complaints of detainees and the Quebec government agreed to pay damages to any person unjustly arrested (only in Quebec). On February 3, 1971, [[John Turner]], the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice of Canada]], reported that 497 persons had been arrested throughout Canada under the War Measures Act<ref>Susan Munroe, [http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/octobercrisis/a/octobercrisistl.htm October Crisis Timeline], Canada Online. Retrieved 21 January 2008.</ref>, of whom 435 had been released. The other 62 were charged, of which 32 were crimes of such seriousness that a [[Quebec Superior Court]] judge refused them bail. The crisis ended a few weeks after the death of Pierre Laporte at the hands of his captors. The fallout of the crisis marked the zenith and twilight of the FLQ which lost membership and public support.

=== Parti Québécois and constitutional crisis ===
In 1977, the newly elected [[Parti Québécois]] government of [[René Lévesque]] introduced the [[Charter of the French Language]]. Often known as [[Bill 101]], it defined French as the only official language of Quebec in areas of provincial jurisdiction.

Lévesque and his party had run in the 1970 and 1973 Quebec elections under a platform of separating Quebec from the rest of Canada. The party failed to win control of Quebec's National Assembly both times — though its share of the vote increased from 23% to 30% — and Lévesque was defeated both times in the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] he contested. In the 1976 election, he softened his message by promising a referendum (plebiscite) on [[sovereignty-association]] rather than outright separation, by which Quebec would have independence in most government functions but share some other ones, such as a common currency, with Canada. On November 15, 1976, Lévesque and the Parti Québécois won control of the provincial government for the first time. The question of [[sovereignty-association]] was placed before the voters in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. During the campaign, [[Pierre Trudeau]] promised that a vote for the "no" side was a vote for reforming Canada. Trudeau advocated the [[patriation]] of Canada's Constitution from the [[United Kingdom]]. The existing constitutional document, the [[British North America Act]], could only be amended by the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] upon a request by the Canadian parliament.

Sixty percent of the Quebec electorate voted against the proposition. Polls showed that the overwhelming majority of English and immigrant Quebecers voted against, and that French Quebecers were almost equally divided, with older voters less in favour and younger voters more in favour. After his loss in the referendum, Lévesque went back to Ottawa to start negotiating a new constitution with Trudeau, his minister of Justice [[Jean Chrétien]] and the nine other provincial premiers. Lévesque insisted Quebec be able to veto any future constitutional amendments. The negotiations quickly reached a stand-still.

Then on the night of November 4, 1981 (widely known in Quebec as ''La nuit des longs couteaux'' and in the rest of Canada as the [[Patriation#The Kitchen Accord|"Kitchen Accord"]]) Federal Justice Minister Jean Chrétien<!--not PM Trudeau, as erroneously reported here before. PM Trudeau had simply pointed out to the provinces that had held out with Lévesque that he had been individually negotiating with Lévesque, against the terms of the agreement between all the hold-out provinces--> met with all of the provincial premiers except [[René Lévesque]] to sign the document that would eventually become the new Canadian constitution. The next morning, they presented the "fait accompli" to Lévesque. Lévesque refused to sign the document and returned to Quebec. In 1982, Trudeau had the new constitution approved by the British Parliament, with Quebec's signature still missing (a situation that persists to this day). The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed Trudeau's assertion that every province's approval is not required to amend the constitution.

In subsequent years, two attempts were made to gain Quebec's approval of the constitution. The first was the [[Meech Lake Accord]] of 1987, which was finally abandoned in 1990 when the province of [[Manitoba]] did not pass it within the established deadline. ([[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] premier [[Clyde Wells]] had expressed his opposition to the accord, but, with the failure in Manitoba, the vote for or against Meech never took place in his province.) This led to the formation of the sovereignist [[Bloc Québécois]] party in Ottawa under the leadership of [[Lucien Bouchard]], who had resigned from the federal cabinet. The second attempt, the [[Charlottetown Accord]] of 1992, was rejected by 56.7% of all Canadians and 57% of Quebecers. This result caused a split in the [[Parti libéral du Québec|Quebec Liberal Party]] that led to the formation of the new [[Action démocratique du Québec|Action démocratique]] (Democratic Action) party led by [[Mario Dumont]] and [[Jean Allaire]].

On October 30, 1995, with the [[Parti Québécois]] back in power since 1994, a [[1995 Quebec referendum|second referendum]] on sovereignty took place. This time, it was rejected by a slim majority (50.6% NO to 49.4% YES); a clear majority of French-speaking Quebecers voted in favour of sovereignty.

The referendum was enshrouded in controversy. Federalists complained that an unusually high number of ballots had been rejected in pro-federalist areas, notably in the largely Jewish and Greek riding of [[Chomedey (electoral district)|Chomedey]] (11.7 % or 5,500 of its ballots were spoiled, compared to 750 or 1.7% in the general election of 1994) although Quebec's chief electoral officer found no evidence of outright fraud. The federal government was accused of not respecting provincial laws with regard to spending during referendums (leading to a corruption scandal that would become public a decade later, greatly damaging the Liberal Party's standing), and of having accelerated the naturalization of immigrants in Quebec before the referendum in order that they could vote, as naturalized citizens were believed more likely to vote no. (43,850 immigrants were naturalized in 1995, whereas the average number between 1988 and 1998 was 21,733.)

The same night of the referendum, an angry [[Jacques Parizeau]], then premier and leader of the "Yes" side, declared that the loss was because of "[[Money and the ethnic vote]]". Parizeau resigned over public outrage and as per his commitment to do so in case of a loss. [[Lucien Bouchard]] became Quebec's new premier in his place.

Federalists accused the sovereignist side of asking a vague, overly complicated question on the ballot. Its English text read as follows:
<blockquote>
''Do you agree that Québec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Québec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?''
</blockquote>
After winning the next election in 1998, Bouchard retired from politics in 2001. [[Bernard Landry]] was then appointed leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] and premier of Quebec. In 2003, Landry lost the election to the [[Parti Libéral du Québec|Quebec Liberal Party]] and [[Jean Charest]]. Landry stepped down as PQ leader in 2005, and in a crowded race for the party leadership, [[André Boisclair]] was elected to succeed him. He also resigned after the renewal of the Quebec Liberal Party's government in the [[2007 Quebec election|2007 general election]] and the Parti Québécois becoming the second opposition party, behind the Action Démocratique. The PQ has promised to hold another referendum should it return to government.

===Quebec as a nation===
Given the province's heritage and the preponderance of French (unique among the Canadian provinces), there is an ongoing debate in Canada regarding the status of Quebec and its people (wholly or partially). Prior attempts to amend the Canadian constitution to acknowledge Quebec as a '[[distinct society]]' – referring to the province's uniqueness within Canada regarding law, language, and culture – have been unsuccessful; however, the federal government under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]] would later endorse recognition of Quebec as a "unique society".<ref>http://www.exec.gov.nl.ca/currentevents/unity/unityr1.htm</ref> On October 30, 2003, the National Assembly of Quebec voted unanimously to affirm "that the Quebecers form a [[nation]]"<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.saic.gouv.qc.ca/publications/resolutions/20031030.pdf ''Résolution de l'Assemblée Nationale du Québec'', October 30, 2003]|95.4&nbsp;KB}}</ref>.
On November 27, 2006, the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] passed a motion moved by Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] declaring that "this House recognize[s] that the [[Québécois]] form a nation within a united Canada."<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2544166&File=0#SOB-1798651 Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061128.wnation28/BNStory/National/home Galloway, Gloria; Curry, Bill; Dobrota, Alex; ''Globe and Mail'': 'Nation' motion passes, but costs Harper; November 28, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061127.wchong1127/BNStory/National Bonoguore, Tenille; Sallot, Jeff; ''Globe and Mail'': Harper's Quebec motion passes easily; November 27, 2006]</ref> However, there is considerable debate and uncertainty over what this means<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parliament39/motion-quebecnation.html| title = Debate: The motions on the Québécois nation | publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-11-24 | accessdate = 2007-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/12/19/harper-motion.html?ref=rss | title = Who's a Québécois?

At present, [[Quebec nationalism|Nationalism]] plays a large role in the politics of Quebec, with all three major provincial political parties seeking greater autonomy and recognition of the ''[[Québécois]]'' people as a nation<ref name="assnat.qc.ca"/>. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to examining and defining the nature of Quebec's association with the rest of Canada. Currently, the population is roughly equally divided between two political visions for the future of their province.{{fact|date=November 2008}} About half of Quebecers support the idea of either full sovereignty (completely separating from Canada and forming an independent republic) or else forming a looser form of sovereignty-association with the rest of Canada. A Sovereignty Association means that some institutions and government services would be shared with the Federal Canadian Government in a similar way that the European Union shares a common currency and various other services. On the other hand, a roughly equal faction of Quebecers are satisfied with the status quo and wish their province to remain within a united Canadian federation.

== Values and Fundamentals of Quebec Society ==

On February 8, 2007, Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]] announced the setting up of a ''[[Reasonable accommodation#The_Royal_Commission_on_Reasonable_Accommodation|Commission tasked with consulting Quebec Society on the matter of arrangements regarding cultural diversity]]''. The PM's press release<ref>''Le premier ministre énonce sa vision et crée une commission spéciale d’étude'' (8 février 2007) ''[http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/communiques/2007/fevrier/2007-02-08.shtml]''. Retrieved on November 6, 2008</ref> reasserted the Three Fundamental Values of Quebec Society:

* Equality between Men and Women
* Primacy of the French Language
* Separation of State and religion

{{"|[These Values] are not subject to any arrangement. They cannot be subordinated to any other principle.<ref>''Ibid''. Free translation.</ref>}}

Furthermore, Quebec is a free and democratic society that abides by the [[Rule of Law]]<ref>[http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/gouv/societedroit/?lang=en]Retrieved on November 7, 2008</ref>

Quebec Society bases its cohesion and specificity on a set of statements, a few notable examples of which include:

* The ''[[Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]''<ref>[http://www.cdpdj.qc.ca/en/commun/docs/charter.pdf] Retrieved on November 6, 2008</ref>

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Quebec|French Canadian}}
At 1.65 in 2007, Quebec's [[fertility rate]] is slightly above the Canada-wide rate of 1.59<ref>http://communiques.gouv.qc.ca/gouvqc/communiques/GPQF/Juin2008/03/c7737.html</ref> but well below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1. This contrasts with fertility rates before 1960, which were among the highest of any industrialized society. Although Quebec is home to only 23.9% of the population of Canada, the number of international adoptions in Quebec is the highest of all provinces of Canada. In 2001, 42% of international adoptions in Canada were carried out in Quebec.

It should be noted however, that there is a significant undercount, as many of the biggest Indian bands regularly refuse to participate in Canadian censuses for political reasons regarding the question of aboriginal sovereignty. In particular, the largest [[Mohawk]] [[Iroquois]] reserves ([[Kahnawake]], [[Akwesasne]] and [[Kanesatake]]) were not counted.

===Religion===
Quebec is unique among the provinces in its overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]] population. This is a legacy of colonial times when only Roman Catholics were permitted to settle in [[New France]].

The 2001 census showed the population to be 83.4% [[Catholic|Catholic Christian]] (including 83.2% [[Roman Catholic]]); 4.7% [[Protestant|Protestant Christian]] (including 1.2% [[Anglican]], 0.7% [[United Church of Canada|United Church]]; and 0.5% [[Baptist]]); 1.4% [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox Christian]] (including 0.7% [[Greek Orthodox]]); and 0.8% [[Christian|Other Christian]]; as well as 1.5% [[Muslim]]; 1.3% [[Jewish]]; 0.6% [[Buddhist]]; 0.3% [[Hindu]]; and 0.1% [[Sikh]]. An additional 5.8% of the population said they had no religious affiliation (including 5.6% who stated that they had no religion at all).<br />

The [[English-speaking Quebecers|English-speaking community]] or [[Anglophones]] are entitled to services in English in the areas of justice, health, and education (by strict exception)<ref name="en.wikipedia.org"/>; services in English are offered in municipalities in which more than half the residents have English as their mother tongue.

[[Allophone (Quebec)|Allophones]], whose mother tongue is neither French nor English, make up 11.9% (886,280) of the population<ref name=autogenerated1 />.

There is a considerable number of people that consider themselves to be [[bilingual]] (having a knowledge of French and English). In Quebec, about 40.6% (3,017,860) of the population are bilingual, and for the Island of Montreal, this proportion grows to 60% (1,020,760) of the island's population. Quebec has the highest proportion of bilinguals among the other Canadian provinces. The proportion in the [[rest of Canada]] is only about 10.2% (2,430,990) of the population having a knowledge of both of the country's official languages. Overall, 17.4% (5,448,850) of Canadians report as bilingual<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=24&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=Quebec&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&Custom= |title=Language |accessdate=2007-12-04 |work=Statistics Canada }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CD&Code1=2466&Geo2=PR&Code2=24&Data=Count&SearchText=Montreal&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&Custom= |title=Language |accessdate=2008-02-18 |work=Statistics Canada }}</ref>.

Languages other than French on commercial signs are only permitted if French is given marked prominence, but recent arguments have led to many conflicts to this rule.

====Mother tongues====
Of the 7,546,131 population counted by the 2006 census, 7,435,905 people completed the section about language. Of these 7,339,495 gave singular responses to the question regarding [[mother tongue]]. The languages most commonly reported were the following:

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Quebec}}
[[Image:Montreal Twilight Panorama 2006.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Montreal]], North America's Francophone metropolis]]

The St. Lawrence River Valley is a fertile agricultural region, producing [[dairy]] products, [[fruit]], [[vegetable]]s, [[foie gras]], [[maple syrup]] (Quebec is the world's largest producer), and [[livestock]].

North of the St. Lawrence River Valley, the territory of Quebec has significant resources in its coniferous forests, lakes, and rivers—pulp and [[paper]], [[lumber]], and [[hydroelectricity]] are still some of the province's most important industries.

There is a significant concentration of high-tech industries around Montreal, including aerospace companies such as aircraft manufacturer [[Bombardier]], the jet engine company [[Pratt & Whitney]], the flight simulator builder [[CAE (company)|CAE]] and defence contractor [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin, Canada]]. In the video game industry, large video game companies such as [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Ubisoft]] have studios in Montreal<ref>[http://theconsolewars.blogspot.com/2005/11/montreal-and-revolution.html The Console Wars: Montreal and the Revolution | Xbox 360, Playstation 3 PS3, Revolution]</ref>.

== Government ==
{{main|Politics of Quebec|Monarchy in Quebec}}
[[Image:L'Assemblée Nationale du Québec.jpg|thumb|right|[[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] in [[Quebec City]]]]
The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Quebec|Lieutenant Governor]] represents [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as [[head of state]]. The head of government is the [[List of Quebec premiers|Premier]] (called ''premier ministre'' in French) who leads the largest party in the [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] or ''Assemblée Nationale'', from which the Council of Ministers is appointed.

Until 1968, the Quebec [[legislature]] was [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[Legislative Council of Quebec|Legislative Council]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec|Legislative Assembly]]. In that year the Legislative Council was abolished, and the Legislative Assembly was renamed the National Assembly. Quebec was the last province to abolish its legislative council.

The government of Quebec awards an order of merit called the [[National Order of Quebec]]. It is inspired in part by the [[France|French]] [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]]. It is conferred upon men and women born or living in Quebec (but non-Quebecers can be inducted as well) for outstanding achievements.

== Symbols ==
[[Image:Quebecois flag.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|The '''Fleurdelisé''' leads a ship to harbour near Quebec City.]]
=== Coat of arms ===
In 1939, the [[government of Quebec]] unilaterally ratified its [[Coat of arms of Quebec|coat of arms]] to reflect [[History of Quebec|Quebec's political history]]: French rule (gold lily on blue background), British rule (lion on red background) and Canadian rule (maple leaves) and with Quebec's motto below "Je me souviens"<ref>http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/ Justice Québec – Drapeauet et symboles nationaux {{fr}}</ref>.

=== Motto ===
{{main|Je me souviens}}

[[Je me souviens|''Je me souviens'' ("I remember")]] was first carved under the coat of arms of Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] façade in 1883. It is an official part of the coat of arms and has been the official license plate motto since 1978, replacing "''[[La belle province]]''" (the beautiful province). The expression ''La belle province'' is still used mostly in tourism as a nickname for the province.

=== Flag ===
{{main|Flag of Quebec}}
The fleur-de-lis, the ancient symbol of the [[French monarchy]], first arrived on the shores of the [[Gaspésie]] in 1534 with [[Jacques Cartier]] on his first voyage. In 1900, Quebec finally sought to have its own uniquely designed flag. By 1903, the parent of today's flag had taken shape, known as the "''[[Fleurdelisé]]''". The flag in its present form with its 4 white "[[fleur-de-lis]]" lilies on a blue background with a white cross replaced the [[Union Jack]] on Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] on January 21, 1948.

=== Other official symbols ===
*The floral emblem of Quebec is the ''[[Iris versicolor]]''<ref name="Qsymbols"/>.
[[Image:Harfang sur neige.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|The ''harfang des neiges'' ([[snowy owl]]), official bird of Quebec.]]
*Since 1987 the avian emblem of Quebec has been the [[Snowy Owl|snowy owl]]<ref name="Qsymbols"/>.
*An official tree, the [[yellow birch]] (''bouleau jaune'', ''merisier''), symbolises the importance Quebecers give to the forests. The tree is known for the variety of its uses and commercial value, as well as its autumn colours<ref name="Qsymbols"/>.

In 1998 the [[Montreal Insectarium]] sponsored a poll to choose an official insect. The [[Limenitis arthemis|White Admiral]] butterfly (''Limenitis arthemis'') [http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/insectarium/toile/info_insectes/fiches/fic_fiche08_amiral.htm] won with 32&nbsp;% of the 230&nbsp;660 votes against the Spotted [[Coccinellidae|lady beetle]] (''Coleomegilla maculata lengi''), the [[Ebony Jewelwing]] [[damselfly]] (''Calopteryx maculata''), a species of [[bumble bee]] (''Bombus impatiens'') and the six-spotted [[tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela sexguttata sexguttata'').

=== Fête nationale ===
{{main|Fête nationale du Québec}}
In 1977, Premier [[René Lévesque]] declared June 24 to be Quebec's National Holiday. Historically June 24 was a holiday honouring one of Quebec's patron saints, [[St. John the Baptist]], which is why it is commonly known as ''La Saint-Jean-Baptiste'' (often shortened to ''La St-Jean''). On this day, the song "[[Gens du pays]]" by [[Gilles Vigneault]] is often heard and commonly regarded as Quebec's unofficial anthem.
