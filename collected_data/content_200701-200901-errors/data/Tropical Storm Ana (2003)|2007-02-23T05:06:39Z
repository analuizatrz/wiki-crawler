'''Tropical Storm Ana''' was the first [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]], and the only tropical storm on record to exist in the month of April in the [[Atlantic basin]].  The storm formed off the coast of [[Florida]] and passed south of [[Bermuda]] before becoming extratropical. Ana killed two people when ocean swells capsized a boat on the Florida coastline.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Ana 2003 track.png}}
Like most other tropical storms that develop between December and April, Ana developed from a previously non-tropical low. A weak low on a surface frontal trough developed 305 miles southeast of [[Miami, Florida]] on [[April 16]]. It drifted eastward and organized into a non-tropical low pressure system on the 18th when an upper-level trough interacted with the front. Under weak steering currents outside of the westerlies, the extratropical low moved northward, where it developed gale force winds on the 19th. The system developed more organized convection, and after the low turned southward late on the 19th, its inner core became more pronounced. Earlier in its life, it was still attached to the front, but when it became detached from the front on [[April 20]], it developed into Subtropical Storm Ana, only the second [[subtropical storm]] on record to form in April.<ref name="AnaTCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Ana|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=July 8|accessyear=2006|format=HTML|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003ana.shtml?}}</ref>

Subtropical Storm Ana drifted east-southeastward, and briefly threatened [[Bermuda]] late on [[April 20]], leading to the issuance of tropical storm warnings that were later dropped. Because of a significant upper-level trough over the storm, the storm was subtropical. However, a developing warm core led to the classification of Tropical Storm Ana early on [[April 21]], the only April storm on record. Though convection decreased throughout the day, by the night, Ana had become much better organized. Convection covered the center, and an eye-like feature was observed on satellite imagery. Based on this, and a [[QuikSCAT]] satellite estimate of 65 mph winds, Ana reached its peak of 60 mph with a minimum central pressure of 994 [[mbar]] ([[hPa]]) on the evening of April 21.<ref name="AnaTCR"/>

A ship located 55 miles south of the center on the night of [[April 22]] directly confirmed the tropical characteristics of Ana. Convection associated with the storm diminished as Ana moved over cooler waters, and upper level wind shear increased over the system. Ana continued to weaken, and became extratropical on [[April 24]] about 885 miles east of Bermuda. As an extratropical storm, Ana continued to the east-northeast. On [[April 27]], what was left of Ana was absorbed by a frontal trough.<ref name="AnaTCR"/>

===Rare formation===
When Ana became tropical on [[April 20]], it became the only Atlantic April tropical storm on record (there was a [[subtropical storm]] in April of the [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season|1992 season]], but Ana was the only April ''tropical'' storm in recorded history).<ref name="AnaTCR"/>

==Impact==
Tropical Storm Ana produced moderate swells along the coast of [[Florida]]. The combination of the swells and an outgoing tide caused a boat to capsize in [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter Inlet]] on [[April 20]]. Two of the boat's occupants drowned, while two others were rescued.<ref name="EvDetail">{{cite web|author=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|title=NCDC: Event Record Details|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=July 8|accessyear=2006|format=HTML|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~494752}}</ref>

On [[Bermuda]], the storm caused sporadic rainfall and gusty winds, though there were no reports of gale force winds.<ref name="Bermuda">{{cite web|author=Bermuda Weather Service|title=The 2003 Hurricane Season in Bermuda|publisher=WMO|accessdate=July 8|accessyear=2006|format=DOC|url=http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/Meetings/HC-26/doc14add3.doc}}</ref>

The name Ana was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and will be used again for the [[2009 Atlantic hurricane season|2009 season]].
