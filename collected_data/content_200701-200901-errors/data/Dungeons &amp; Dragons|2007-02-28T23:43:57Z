'''''Dungeons & Dragons''''' (abbreviated as '''''D&D''''' or '''''DnD''''') is a [[fantasy]] [[Role-playing game|tabletop role-playing game]] (RPG) currently published by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. The original ''Dungeons & Dragons'', designed by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]], was first published in [[1974]] by Gygax's company [[TSR, Inc.|Tactical Studies Rules]] (TSR). Originally derived from [[Miniature wargaming|minature wargame]]s (particularly ''[[chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]''),<ref name="Banshee_Gygax"/>  ''D&D'''s publication is widely regarded as the beginning of modern role-playing games—and by extension, the entire role-playing game (RPG) and massive multiplayer online role-playing game ([[MMORPG]]) industry.

Players of ''D&D'' create characters who embark upon imaginary adventures in which they battle monsters, gather treasure, interact with each other, and earn [[experience points]] to become increasingly powerful as the game progresses. ''D&D'' departs from traditional wargaming by assigning each player a specific character, as opposed to an army. Also much, in some versions all, of the action takes place in the imagination of the players, using paper, pencil, and dice as the only physical items involved. ''D&D'' uses the concept of a [[Dungeon Master]] (DM), a referee and storyteller responsible for maintaining the fictional [[setting (fiction)|setting]] of the game.

The early success of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' quickly led to a proliferation of similar game systems, such as ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]'',<ref name="hist2"/> ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]'' and ''[[RuneQuest]]''.<ref name="hist3"/>  Despite this competition, ''D&D'' has continued to dominate the role-playing game industry throughout its existence, enjoying a nearly impenetrable market position.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In [[1977]] the game was split into two slightly different versions: the simpler ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and the more complex '''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''''' (abbreviated as '''''AD&D''''' or '''''ADnD''''').{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  In [[2000]], the simpler version of the game was discontinued, and the complex version was renamed simply ''Dungeons & Dragons'' with the release of its 3rd Edition.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The current version of the game, released in July [[2003]], is ''Dungeons & Dragons v3.5'' (also known as the Revised 3rd Edition or ''D&D3.5'').

[[As of 2006]], ''Dungeons & Dragons'' remains the best-known and best-selling role-playing game, with an estimated 20 million having played the game and over [[United States dollar|US$]]1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in book and equipment sales.<ref>{{cite news

==Play overview==
[[Image:Players hndbk v35 cover.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The ''Player's Handbook'' for ''D&D v3.5'', one of the game's three core rulebooks]]

''Dungeons & Dragons'' is a structured, yet open-ended, role-playing game.  Typically, each player controls only a single character. As a group, these [[player characters]] (PCs) are often described as a "party" of adventurers, often each with his or her own areas of specialized talents. During the course of play, each player directs the actions of his or her character and its interactions with the other characters in the game.  A game often continues over a series of meetings, and together these related gaming sessions are called a "campaign."

The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game is determined by the [[Dungeon Master]] (DM) according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules.  The DM selects and describes the various [[non-player character]]s (NPCs), the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions.  The game's extensive rules —- which cover such subjects as social interactions, [[Spells of Dungeons & Dragons|magic use]], [[combat]], and the effect of [[weather]] on PCs —- help the DM to make these decisions. In some situations, the DM may choose to substitute, modify or override one or more of the game's rules.

The most recent version of the game's rules are detailed in three core [[Dungeons & Dragons manuals|rulebooks]]: The ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', and the ''[[Monster Manual]]''. A ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game|Basic Game]]'' boxed set contains abbreviated rules to help beginners learn the game.

The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of [[dice#non-cubical dice|polyhedral dice]]. The current editions also assumes the [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figure]]s or counters on a grided surface, items that were optional in earlier editions.<ref>{{cite web

===Game mechanics===
{{main|Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)}}

[[Image:DnD Dice Set.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A set of standard D&D dice: (from left) d4, d6, d8, d12, d20, and two d10s, respectively, for percentile: ones and tens.]]
Before the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] his or her player character (PC) and records the details (described below) on a [[character sheet]].

First, a player rolls dice to determine his or her character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#ability scores|ability scores]], which consist of strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.  The player then chooses a [[Race (fantasy)|race]] (species), a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (similar to a profession), and an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook) and a number of skills to enhance the character's basic abilities. Additional [[back-story]] not covered by specific rules is often also developed to flesh out the character.

During a game, players describe their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM [[in character]] who describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. More complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to success or include the character's abilities, skills and the difficulty of the task.

As the game is played, each PC grows and changes over time as they gain experience. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills,  wealth, and may even change alignment or add additional character classes. One key way characters progress is by earning [[experience points]] (XP) when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level]], which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can also be lost in some circumstances, such as creatures that drain energy, or certain magical powers which require payment of an XP cost.

[[Hit point]]s (hp) are a measure of a characters vitality or health determined by the class or race, level and constitution. They are reduced in combat and losing hp is the most common way to die, although death can also be cause by ability or level loss. If a PC dies it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, though with some penalties. If not possible, or if the player chooses, he may create a new PC to resume playing.

===Adventures and campaigns===
[[Image:S3ModuleCover.jpg|thumb|175px|''[[Expedition to the Barrier Peaks|S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks]]'' was one of the few adventures released by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] to include [[science fiction]] elements, such as [[ray gun]]s and [[robot]]s.]]
{{main|Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons) }}

A typical ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game consists of an "adventure", which is roughly equivalent to a single story.  Adventures are usually designed by the DM either from scratch or by using [[List of Dungeons & Dragons adventures|pre-made adventures]] (previously known as [[List of Dungeons & Dragons modules|modules]]) which have been published throughout the history of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. Published adventures typically include a backstory, maps, and goals for PCs to achieve, some include illustrations or handouts.

A series of adventures is commonly referred to as a "campaign". The locations where these adventures occur, whether a city, country, planet or an entire universe are often also called a campaign but are more correctly referred to as "[[campaign setting]]s".  The settings are based in various [[Fantasy subgenres]] and feature varying levels of magic and technology. Popular [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for Dungeons & Dragons]] include [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Greyhawk]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Mystara]], and [[Eberron]].

===Miniature figures===
[[Image:HugeGoldDragonMini.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A ''Dungeons & Dragons'' miniature figure]]
<!-- FAIR USE of HugeGoldDragonMini.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:HugeGoldDragonMini.jpg for rationale -->

The wargames from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figure]]s to represent combatants. ''D&D'' continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursor, ''Chainmail'', with each figure representing a specific character or monster. Although the original rules of ''D&D'' required the use of miniatures for combat resolution, the rules quickly evolved. After the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was resolved verbally and miniatures were no longer required for gameplay.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} However, some players continue to use them as a visual reference.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In the [[1970s]], numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. In [[1977]], the British manufacturer [[Minifigs|Miniature Figurines Limited]] became the first company to partner with [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] and release miniatures under the official Dungeons and Dragons label.<ref>{{cite web

Periodically, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming.  Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 & 1989) and a new edition of ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' (2001) provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.

''Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition '' (2000) assumes the use of [[miniature figure|miniatures]] to represent combat situations in play, an aspect of the game that was even more emphasized in the v3.5 revision. The ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures Game]]'' (2003) which is sold as sets of plastic, randomly assorted, pre-painted miniatures, and can be used as either part of a standard ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game or as a stand-alone [[collectible miniatures game]].<ref>{{cite web

===Sources and Influences on the Development of ''D&D''===
{{main|List of sources and inspirations for elements in Dungeons & Dragons}}

The immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy suplement, before the game was published as [[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]. [[Dave Arneson]] used Chainmail to run games where players controlled a single character instead of an army, an inovation that inspired D&D.<ref name="Banshee_Gygax">{{cite web

Many ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements also appear in hobbies of the mid- to late twentieth century (though these elements also existed previously). Character-based role playing, for example, can be seen in [[historical reenactment]] and [[improvisational theatre]]. Game-world simulations were well-developed in [[wargaming]]. Fantasy milieus specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games among others. Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.

The theme of D&D was influenced by [[mythology]], [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy authors of the 1960s and 1970s. The presence of [[halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], [[half-elf|half-elves]], [[Orc (Dungeons & Dragons)|orcs]], [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragons]] and the like often draw comparisons to the work of [[Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Gygax maintains that he was influenced very little by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (although the owners of that work's copyright forced the name change of hobbit to halfling), stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity of the work<ref>[[Robert J. Kuntz|Kuntz, Rob]] (1978). 'Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons' in ''Best of Dragon Vol. 1'', TSR, Inc. 1985.</ref><ref name="Dragon95">Gygax, Gary (1985). 'On the influence of J.R.R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games.' ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'', 95:12-13, Mar 1985.</ref>

The magic system, in which wizards memorize spells that are forgotten once cast, was heavily influenced by the ''[[Dying Earth|The Dying Earth]]'' stories and novels of [[Jack Vance]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

The original alignment system (which grouped all players and creatures into "Law" and "Chaos") was derived from the novel ''[[Three Hearts and Three Lions]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}   A troll described in this work also influenced the D&D definition of that monster<ref name="Dragon95"/> (additionally, the novel ''[[Stormbringer]]'' has been cited as an influence).{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

Other influences include the works of [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[A. Merritt]], [[H.P. Lovecraft]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Fletcher Pratt]], [[Roger Zelazny]],  and [[Michael Moorcock]].<ref>According to the original [[Dungeon Master's Guide|Dungeon Masters Guide]] ''Appendix N: Inspirational and Educational Reading'' the first seven listed here are the "most immediate influences." (Gygax 1979a:224)</ref> Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works ranging from [[Van vogt|A. E. van Vogt's]] "The Destroyer" (the [[Displacer Beast]]), [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[Jabberwocky]]" (Vorpal sword) to the Book of [[Genesis]] (the clerical spell "Blade Barrier" was inspired by the "flaming sword which turned every way" at the gates of [[Eden]]).<ref>{{cite web

===Edition history===
{{main|Editions of Dungeons & Dragons}}
''Dungeons & Dragons'' has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.
[[Image:D&d_Box1st.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The original ''Dungeons & Dragons'' set]]
The original '''''Dungeons and Dragons''''' was a box set published in [[1974]] with several supplements and magazine articles of official rules published over the next few years. 

In 1977, TSR released two new versions of the game: ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (AD&D) and ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (sometimes called ''Basic D&D'' to distinguish it from ''AD&D'', though TSR never used that term).

The version called '''''Dungeons & Dragons''''' (1977 - 1999), by virtue of being published as discrete sets with increasing complexity, was seen as an introductory version of ''AD&D''. Though simpler overall, it included rules for some situations not covered in ''AD&D''. There were five sets ''Basic'' (1977, revised in 1981 and again in 1983), ''Expert'' (1981, revised in 1983), ''Companion'' (1983), ''Master'' (1985) and ''Immortals'' (1985, 1991) each covering gameplay for higher character experiences levels than the former. The first four were later compiled as a single hardcover book, the ''Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia'' (1991). 

'''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''''' (or ''AD&D'') was a more complex version of the game in many ways and was designed to collect, revise, and expand on the rules from the original version and its supplements. The ''AD&D'' game was not intended to be directly compatible with ''D&D'' and requires some conversion to play between the rule sets. The term ''Advanced'' describes the more complex rules and does not imply "for higher-level gaming abilities." Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the "core rulebooks", were released: The ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several additional books published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985), included a large number of new rules.

[[Image:DungeonMasterGuide4Cover.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|First edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Masters Guide'']]

'''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition''''' (sometimes referred to as ''AD&D2'' or ''2nd Ed'') was published in 1989, once again as three core rulebooks. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder which was later replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. The release of ''AD&D2'' also corresponded with an effort to remove aspects of the game which had attracted negative publicity. This edition removed references to demons and devils, suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types (such as assassins and half-orcs).  Aside from these revisions, the rules had few changes except for the addition of non-weapon proficiencies (which originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements) and the division of spells into schools and spheres. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised and a series of ''Player's Option'' manuals were released as optional core rulebooks. Although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition (in fact, the Player's Handbook contained a notice stating "this is not ''D&D'' 3rd edition"), this revision is seen by some fans as a distinct edition of the game and is sometimes referred to as ''AD&D 2.5''.

'''''Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition''''' (also referred to as ''D&D3'' or ''3E'' and not to be confused with the 1983 edition of the basic ''D&D'' game) was released in 2000 following three years of development which began when a near-bankrupt TSR was bought by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 1997. The 3rd Edition was the largest revision of the ''D&D'' rules to date, and also served as the basis for a broader role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the [[d20 System]]. The 3rd Edition rules were designed with the intention of making them more internally consistent and significantly less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players much more flexibility in creating the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage players to further customize their characters. The new rules also standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. 

'''''Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5''''' In 2003, the 3rd Edition rules were revised (also known as Revised 3rd Edition or ''D&D3.5''). This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes (mostly minor) and expanded the core rulebooks.

A wide variety of optional supplements have been published for every edition of ''D&D''. These supplements commonly include new rules, items, spells, and creatures. Other supplements include new adventures or detail entire fantasy worlds. The various editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' have won many [[Origins Award]]s, including ''All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977'', ''Best Roleplaying Rules of 1989'', and ''Best Roleplaying Game of 2000'' for the three flagship editions of the game.<ref>{{cite web

===Influence===
''Dungeons & Dragons'' was the first modern role-playing game and it established many of the conventions which have dominated the genre. Particularly notable are the use of dice as a resolution mechanic, character record sheets, progressive character development, and game-master-centered group dynamics. It created its own niche and led to the development of a multitude of role-playing games. [[Science fiction]], [[horror fiction|horror]], [[superhero]]es, [[cartoon]]s, [[western movie|westerns]], [[espionage|spies and espionage]], and many other fictional settings were adapted to role-playing games.

Over the years, many gamers have criticized various aspects of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' rules. Within months of ''Dungeons & Dragons'''s release, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, intially mostly in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other role-playing games inspired by D&D include [[Tunnels and Trolls]] (1975), [[Tékumel|Empire of the Petal Throne]] (1975), [[Chivalry and Sorcery]] (1976),<ref name="hist2">{{cite journal

</ref>. Dungeons & Dragons and the games it influenced also fed back into the genre's origin—miniatures wargames—with combat strategy games like ''[[Battletech]]'', ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battles]]'' and ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]''. [[Collectible card games]], like [[Magic: The Gathering]], were also heavily influenced by ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and its legacy. 

With the launch of ''Dungeons & Dragons'''s [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|3rd Edition]], Wizards of the Coast made the [[d20 System]] available under the [[Open Gaming License]] (OGL) and [[D20 System#d20 System Trademark License|d20 Trademark License]].  Under these licenses, authors are free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements. The OGL and d20 Trademark License also made possible new versions of older games, such as ''Call of Cthulhu'', using the new system. 

Recent years have seen a trend towards recreating older editions of [[D&D]]. [[Necromancer Games]] with its slogan "Third Edition Rules, First Edition Feel", and Goodman Games [http://www.goodmangames.com/DCCpreview.php Dungeon Crawl Classics] range are both examples of this in material for d20 System. Other companies have created whole games based on earlier editions of D&D, Key examples include:
*'''[[HackMaster]]''' (2001) by [[Kenzer and Company]] is a licensed, non-OGL, semi-satirical follow-on to 1st and 2nd Edition.
*'''[[Castles & Crusades]]''' (2005) by [http://www.trolllord.com/ Troll Lord Games] a reimaging of early editions by streamlining rules from OGL, is being supported by [[Gary Gygax]].
*'''[http://www.knights-n-knaves.com/osric/ OSRIC]''' (Old School Reference & Index Compilation) is an attempt to compile the underlying rules from early editions without including any copyright material.

''D&D'''s commercial success has led to many other related products, including (but not limited to) [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]], [[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon Magazine]], an [[Dungeons & Dragons (TV series)|animated television series]], a [[Dungeons & Dragons (film)|film]] and computer games such as the [[MMORPG]] [[Dungeons & Dragons Online: Stormreach]].  Hobby and toy stores sell dice, miniatures, modules and other game aids related to ''D&D'' and its game offspring.

<!--ATTENTION:  PLEASE DO NOT LIST SPECIFIC POP CULTURE REFERENCES TO D&D HERE.  There is a separate article, "List of Dungeons & Dragons pop culture references", for listing specific references.-->
{{main|List of Dungeons & Dragons popular culture references}}
As the popularity of ''D&D'' grew throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, references to the game often began to appear in popular culture.  Numerous games, films and cultural references based on ''D&D'' or ''D&D''-like fantasies, characters, or adventures have been ubiquitous since the end of the 1970s.  Typically, though by no means exclusively, ''D&D'' players are portrayed as the epitome of [[geek]]dom.  References to the game are used as a shorthand to establish characterization or provide the punchline of a joke. Many players, miffed with this stereotype, embrace the fact that the film star [[Vin Diesel]], [[comedian]] [[Stephen Colbert]] and actor [[Wil Wheaton]] have made their ''D&D'' hobbies public<ref>Diesel contributed the introduction, and both Colbert and Wheaton page long personal reflections to Johnson et al. (2004)</ref>

==Controversy and notoriety==
{{main|Dungeons & Dragons controversies}}

At various times in its history, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has received negative publicity, in particular from some fundamentalist Christians, for alleged promotion of such practices as [[Satanism#Devil worship|devil worship]], [[witchcraft]], [[suicide]], and [[murder]], and for topless drawings of well proportioned female humanoids in the original AD&D manuals (mainly monsters such as [[Harpy|Harpies]], [[Succubus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Succubus]], etc.)<ref>{{cite journal

''Dungeons & Dragons'' has also been the subject of unsubstantiated rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy and reality, even leading to [[psychotic]] episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of [[Steam tunnel incident|James Dallas Egbert III]],<ref>{{cite journal

Early in the game's history, TSR took no action against small publishers producing ''D&D'' compatible material. This attitude changed in the mid 1980s when TSR revoked these rights (even from publishers they had officially licenced, such as [[Judges Guild]]) and took action to prevent others from publishing compatible material, which angered many fans.<ref>{{cite web
