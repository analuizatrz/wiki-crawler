The '''''Los Angeles Times''''' (also known as the '''''LA Times''''') is a daily [[newspaper]] published in [[Los Angeles, California]] and distributed throughout the [[Western United States]]. It is the second-largest metropolitan newspaper in the [[United States]] and the third-most widely distributed newspaper in the [[United States]].<ref>According to the 2007 ''[[World Almanac]]''</ref>

Founded in 1881, the ''Times'' has won 37 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s through 2004; this includes four in editorial cartooning, and one each in spot news reporting for the 1965 [[Watts Riots]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]. In [[2004 Pulitzer Prize|2004]], the paper won five prizes, which was the second-most by any paper in one year (the first was ''The New York Times'' in [[2002 Pulitzer Prize|2002]]).

== History ==
{{seealso|List of Los Angeles Times publishers}}
The paper was first published as the '''''Los Angeles Daily Times''''' on [[December 4]], [[1881]], but soon went bankrupt. The paper's printer, the Mirror Company, took over the newspaper and installed former [[Union Army]] [[lieutenant colonel]] [[Harrison Gray Otis]] as an editor. Otis made the paper a financial success.  In 1884, he bought out the newspaper and printing company to form the Times-Mirror Company.

[[Image:Photo-los-angeles-times-building-post-bombing.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Rubble of the ''Times'' building after the 1910 bombing.]]
Historian Kevin Starr lists Otis (with [[Henry E. Huntington]] and [[Moses Sherman]]) as a businessman "capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment."<ref>''Inventing the Dream: California Through the Progressive Era'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985): 228.</ref> Otis's editorial policy was based on civic [[boosterism]], extolling the virtues of Los Angeles and promoting its growth. Towards those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city's water supply by acquiring the watershed of the [[Owens Valley]], an effort (highly) fictionalized in the Roman Polanski movie ''[[Chinatown (1974 movie)|Chinatown]]'' which is also covered in ''[[California Water Wars]]''. 

The efforts of the ''Times'' to fight local unions led to the [[October 1]], [[1910]], [[Los Angeles Times bombing|bombing of its headquarters]], killing 21 people. Two union leaders, [[The McNamara Brothers|James and Joseph McNamara]], were charged. The [[American Federation of Labor]] hired noted trial attorney [[Clarence Darrow]] to represent the brothers, who eventually pleaded guilty, although supporters then (and since) believed the two men were framed. {{Fact|date=December 2007}} The paper soon relocated to the [[Times Building]], a Los Angeles landmark.

=== Chandler era ===
On Otis's death in 1917, his son-in-law [[Harry Chandler]] took over the reins as publisher of the ''Times''. Harry Chandler was succeeded in 1944 by his son, [[Norman Chandler]], who ran the paper during the rapid growth of [[post-war]] Los Angeles. Norman's wife, heiress and fellow [[Stanford]] alum [[Dorothy Buffum Chandler]], became active in civic affairs and led the effort to build the [[Los Angeles Music Center]], whose main concert hall was named the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] in her honor. Family members are buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery near Paramount Studios. The site also includes a memorial to the Times building bombing victims.

The paper was a founding co-owner of then-[[CBS]] turned independent television station [[KTTV]]; it became that station's sole owner in 1951 and remained so until it sold it to [[Metromedia]] in 1963.  Now that station is owned by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] through [[News Corporation|Newscorp]].

The fourth generation of family publishers, [[Otis Chandler]], held that position from 1960 to 1980. Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family's paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the [[Northeastern United States]] due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation's most respected newspapers, notably ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Washington Post]]''. Believing that the newsroom was "the heartbeat of the business"<ref name="mcdougal">Dennis McDougal, ''Privileged son: Otis Chandler and the rise and fall of the L.A. Times dynasty,'' Cambridge, Mass.: Da Capo, 2002</ref>, Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with the ''Washington Post'' to form the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations.

During the 1960s, the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes, more than its previous nine decades combined.

The paper's early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history ''Thinking Big'' (1977, ISBN 0399117660), and was one of four organizations profiled by [[David Halberstam]] in ''[[The Powers That Be (book)|The Powers That Be]]'' (1979, ISBN 0394503813; 2000 reprint ISBN 0252069412).  It has also been the whole or partial subject of nearly thirty dissertations in communications or social science in the past four decades.<ref>''ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts'', accessed June 8, 2007.</ref>

=== Modern era ===

The ''Los Angeles Times'' paid circulation figures have decreased since the mid-1990s.  It has recently been unable to pass the one million mark, a milestone easily surpassed in earlier decades.  The circulation drop may be a side effect of a succession of short-lived editors.  They were appointed by publisher [[Mark Willes]], who took the paper in conservative directions after Otis Chandler relinquished day-to-day control in 1995.<ref name="mcdougal" />  Willes, the former president of [[General Mills]], was criticized for his lack of understanding of the newspaper business, and was derisively referred to by reporters and editors as ''[[Cap'n Crunch|Captain Crunch]]''.

Other possible reasons for the circulation drop include an increase in the single copy price from 25 cents to 50 cents<ref>Shah, Diane, "The New Los Angeles Times" ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' 2002, 3.</ref> or the rise in readers preferring to read the online version instead of the hard copy.<ref>Rainey, James, "Newspaper Circulation Continues to Fall," ''Los Angeles Times'' 1 May 2007: D1.</ref> Editor [[Jim O'Shea]], in an internal memo announcing a May 2007, mostly voluntary [[reduction in force]], characterized the decrease in circulation as an "industry-wide problem" which the paper must counter by "growing rapidly on-line," "break[ing] news on the web and explain[ing] and analyz[ing] it in our newspaper."<ref>{{cite news|title=California Split: 57 More Job Cuts at ''L.A.

She speculated that the paper's revenue shortfall could be reversed by expanding coverage of [[economic justice]] topics which she believes are increasingly relevant to [[Southern California]]; she cited the paper's attempted hiring of a "celebrity justice reporter" as an example of the wrong approach.<ref name="huffington" />

In 2000, the Times-Mirror Company was purchased by the [[Tribune Company]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]], ending one of the final examples of a family-controlled metropolitan daily newspaper in the U.S. (''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', and others remain). [[John Carroll (journalist)|John Carroll]], former editor of the [[Baltimore Sun]], was brought in to restore the luster of the newspaper.  During his reign at the Los Angeles Times he eliminated more than 200 jobs, but it was not enough for parent company Tribune.  Despite operating profits of 20 percent the Tribune executives were unsatisfied with returns and by 2005 John Carroll had left the ''Los Angeles Times''.

[[Dean Baquet]] replaced John Carroll, who refused to impose the additional cutbacks mandated by Tribune.  Baquet was the first African American to hold this type of editorial position at a top-tier daily.  During Baquet and Carroll's time at the paper it won 13 Pulitzers, more than any other paper but the ''New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Breaking the News|author=Mother Jones|url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2007/03/breaking_the_news_package.html}}</ref>Subsequently, Baquet was himself ousted for not meeting the demands of the Tribune Group- as was publisher Jeffrey Johnson - and replaced by James O'Shea of the Chicago Tribune.  <!-- more please -->

The paper's content and design style has been overhauled several times in recent years in attempts to help increase circulation.  In 2000, a major change more closely organized the news sections (related news was put closer together) and changed the "Local" section to the "California" section with more extensive coverage.  Another major change in 2005 saw the Sunday "Opinion" section retitled the Sunday "Current" section, with a radical change in its presentation and columnists featured. There are regular cross-promotions with co-owned KTLA to bring evening news viewers into the ''Times'' fold.

In early 2006, The Times closed its [[San Fernando Valley]] printing plant, leaving press operations at the [[Olympic Plant]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. Also in 2006, the Times announced its circulation at 851,532, down 5.4% from 2005. The Times's loss of circulation is the highest out of the top ten newspapers in the U.S. <ref>http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-05-08-newspaper-circulation_x.htm</ref>. Despite this recent circulation decline, many in the media industry have lauded the newspaper's effort to decrease its reliance on 'other-paid' circulation in favor of building its 'individually-paid' circulation base - which showed a marginal increase in the most recent circulation audit. This distinction reflects the difference between, for example, copies distributed to hotel guests free of charge (other-paid) versus subscriptions and single-copy sales (individually-paid).

In December 2006, a team of Times reporters delivered management with a critique of the paper's online news efforts known as [[the Spring Street Project]]<ref name="Spring Street Transcript">

On [[April 2]], [[2007]], the [[Tribune Company]] announced their acceptance of [[Sam Zell]]'s offer to buy the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',  the ''Los Angeles Times'', and other media assets. Zell reportedly plans to take the company private and sell off the [[Chicago Cubs]] after the 2007 season. He will also sell the company's 25 percent interest in [[Comcast SportsNet]] Chicago. Up until the time of shareholder approval, Los Angeles billionaires [[Ron Burkle]] and [[Eli Broad]] may submit a higher bid in which case Zell would receive a $25 million buyout fee. <ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/324173,CST-NWS-Trib03.article Tribune goes to Zell], from the April 3, 2007 edition of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''</ref>

== Competition and rivalry ==
[[Image:Latimes-bldg-from-grand-ave.png|thumb|right|350px|The ''Los Angeles Times'' building as seen from Grand Ave.]]
By the mid-1940s, the ''Los Angeles Times'' was the leading newspaper in terms of sales in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. After World War II, it launched ''The Mirror'' an afternoon tabloid to compete with Hearst's ''[[Herald-Express]]''. ''The Mirror'' absorbed ''[[The Los Angeles Daily News]]'' in 1954 and ceased publication in 1962, when ''[[The Herald-Express]]'' was merged with the morning ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]''.

In 1989, its last rival for the Los Angeles daily newspaper market, The ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]'', went out of business, making Los Angeles nominally a one-newspaper city. However, in the suburban neighborhoods of the [[San Fernando Valley]], ''The Times'' still competed with ''The Valley News and Greensheet'', which later renamed itself ''[[The Daily News of Los Angeles]]'' to compete with the ''Times.'' ''The L.A. Times'' has an Orange County edition (with its own printing presses and editorial staff) that competes with the [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] based ''[[The Orange County Register]]''. ''[[La Opinión]]'', a [[Spanish language]] daily newspaper previously owned by ''The Times'' for several years in the 1990s, also sells many papers.

Outside of the city of Los Angeles proper, ''The Times'' also competes against several smaller daily papers in nearby Southern California cities.  Examples include ''[[The Long Beach Press-Telegram]]'', ''The [[Daily Breeze]]'' ([[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]]), ''[[The Ventura County Star]]'', ''[[The San Gabriel Valley Tribune]]'', and ''[[The Pasadena Star-News]]''.

In the 1990s, the Los Angeles Times attempted to publish various editions catering to far flung areas. Editions included a [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] edition, an [[Inland Empire, California|Inland Empire]] edition, a [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] edition, and a "National Edition" that was distributed to [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  The National Edition was closed in December 2004. Of these, only the Inland Empire and Ventura County editions remains, although nearby cities such as Bakersfield, Las Vegas, Barstow and Needles still sell the Times in selected newsstands.

Some of these editions were folded in to ''Our Times'', a group of community newspapers included in home delivery and newsstand editions of the regular Los Angeles Metro newspaper. ''Our Times'' was also founded in [[Santa Monica]], due to the closure of the long time ''Outlook'' newspaper.  

Today, remnants of ''Our Times'' are the ''Times Community Newspapers'' that are inserted on a regular basis in some areas of the Los Angeles Times. ''Times Community Newspapers'' are primarily independent local newspapers that were purchased by the Los Angeles Times during its expansion phase, but have a large enough readership and advertiser base to be continued.  These include the ''News-Press'' in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], the ''Leader'' in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] (and surrounding areas), the ''Sun'' in [[La Crescenta, California|La Crescenta]] and surrounding regions, the ''Daily Pilot'' in [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]] and surrounding cities, and the ''Independent'' in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]].

== Features ==
Among its current staff is sports columnist [[Bill Plaschke]], who is also a panelist on [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Around the Horn]]''. [[T.J. Simers]] also writes for the Times and used to appear on the show. Former ''Times'' columnist [[J.A. Adande]] remains an ATH panelist.  The ''Times'' also has [[Helene Elliott]], the first female sportswriter to be inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], and Robert Hillburn and Randy Lewis, two of the best-known pop music critics in America.

One of the ''Times''' best-known columns is "Column One," a feature that appears daily on the front page to the left-hand side.  Established in September 1968, it is a place for the weird and the interesting; in the ''How Far Can a Piano Fly?'' (a compilation of Column One stories) introduction, [[Patt Morrison]] writes that the column's purpose is to elicit a "Gee, that's interesting, I didn't know that" type of reaction.

The ''Times'' also embarks on a number of investigative journalism pieces, researching and dissecting a certain scandal or unfavored part of society.  A series in December 2004 on the [[Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital|King-Drew Medical Center]] led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital's troubled history.  Most recently, journalist Steve Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles' [[Skid Row]].

[[Patrick Goldstein]] writes a weekly column called the ''Big Picture'' for the ''Times''. The column focuses mostly on events and people around film like the [[Oscars]] or [[Michael Moore]].

== Controversies ==
The credibility of the ''Times'' suffered greatly when it was revealed in 1999 that a revenue-sharing arrangement was in place between the ''Times'' and [[Staples Center]] in the preparation of a 168-page magazine about the opening of the sports arena. The magazine's editors and writers  were not informed of the agreement, which breached the "Chinese wall" that traditionally has separated advertising from journalistic functions at American newspapers. Publisher Mark Willes also had not prevented advertisers from pressuring reporters in other sections of the newspaper to write stories favorable to their point of view.<ref>{{cite news|title=Meltdown at the L.A. Times|author=Salon|date=1999-11-05|url=http://www.salon.com/media/log/1999/11/05/media/|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref>

[[Michael Kinsley]] was hired as the Opinion and Editorial ([[Op-Ed]]) Editor in April 2004 to help improve the quality of the opinion pieces.  His role was controversial, as he forced writers to take a more decisive stance on issues.  In 2005, he created a [[Wikitorial]], the first [[Wiki]] by a major news organization.  Although it failed, readers could combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces.  He resigned later that year.

On [[November 12]], [[2005]], new Op-Ed Editor [[Andrés Martinez (editor)|Andrés Martinez]] shook things up by announcing the firing of leftist op-ed columnist [[Robert Scheer]] and conservative editorial cartoonist [[Michael Ramirez]], replacing the two with a more diversified lineup of regular columnists.  The change was not well-received by liberal readers, many of whom accused the newspaper of trying to silence liberal voices and remove controversial writers.

The ''Times'' has also come under controversy for its decision to drop the weekday edition of the [[Garfield]] comic strip in 2005, in favor of a hipper comic strip [[Brevity]], while retaining the Sunday edition. [[Garfield]] was dropped altogether shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite news|title=Garfield no more?|author=[[Editor & Publisher]]|date|2005-01-07|url=http://www.n-philes.com/forums/printthread.php?t=9299|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref>

Following the GOP's defeat in the 06 mid-term Elections, an Opinion piece published on November 19, 2006 by [[Joshua Muravchik]], a leading [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] and a resident scholar at the right-wing [[American Enterprise Institute]], titled BOMB IRAN shocked readers, including over a million Iranian Americans of California, with its hawkish overtures in support of more unilateral action by the United States, this time against Iran.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bomb Iran|author=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-muravchik19nov19,0,1681154.story?coll=la-opinion-center|date=2006-11-19|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref>

On March 22, 2007, editorial page editor [[Andrés Martinez]] resigned following an alleged scandal centering around his girlfriend's professional relationship with a Hollywood producer who had been tapped to guest edit a section in the newspaper.<ref>{{cite news|title=Editor Resigns over Killed Opinion Section|author=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-03-22|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-andres23mar23,0,6732948.story?coll=la-home-headlines|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> In an open letter penned upon leaving the paper, Grazer blasted the publication for allowing the [[Chinese Wall]] between the news and editorial departments to be weakened, accusing news staffers of lobbying the opinion desk.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grazergate, an Epilogue|author=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-03-22|url=http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2007/03/grazergate_the_.html|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref>

Also in March 2007 the ''Times'' faced rumors that publisher David Hiller suggested and approved former Secretary of Defense, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], with whom Hiller has close personal and business contacts, for a guest editorial position at the newspaper.<ref name="Rumsfeld and LA Times">{{cite news|title=LA Times Publisher's Friend and Tribune Co Ex-Director Don Rumsfeld was asked to Guest-Edit after Grazer|author=Deadline Hollywood Daily|date=2007-03-25|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/exclusive-la-times-publishers-friend-and-tribune-co-former-director-donald-rumsfeld-was-to-guest-edit-opinion-pages-after-grazer/|accessdate=2007-03-26}} </ref> Rumsfeld was an influential Iraq war hawk in the [[George W. Bush administration]]. Rumsfeld also has strong ties to the ''Times''' parent company, the [[Tribune Company]], where he was a member of the board of directors.<ref name="Rumsfeld and LA Times"/>

== ''Los Angeles Times'' Book Prizes ==
{{see|List of Los Angeles Times Book Prize winners}}
Since 1980, the ''Los Angeles Times'' has awarded a set of annual book prizes. The Prizes "currently have nine single-title categories: biography, current interest, fiction, first fiction (the Art Seidenbaum Award added in 1991), history, mystery/thriller (category added in 2000), poetry, science and technology (category added in 1989), and young adult fiction (category added in 1998). In addition, the [[Robert Kirsch]] Award is presented annually to a living author with a substantial connection to the American West whose contribution to American letters deserves special recognition" <ref>http://www.latimes.com/extras/bookprizes/index.html ''Los Angeles Times'' Book Prizes home page</ref>.

The Book Prize program was founded by Art Seidenbaum, a ''Los Angeles Times'' book editor from 1978 to 1985; an award named after him was added a year after his death in 1990. The Robert Kirsch Award is named after the longtime ''Times'' book critic who died in 1980. Works are eligible during the year of their first US publication in English, though English does not have to be the original language of the work. The author of each winning book and the Kirsch Award recipient receives a citation and $1,000.
