The '''''trobairitz''''' ({{IPA2|truβajˈɾits}}) were [[Occitan]] female [[troubadour]]s of the [[12th century]] and the [[13th century]]. The word ''trobairitz'' was first used in the 13th-century [[romance (genre)|romance]] ''[[Romance of Flamenca|Flamenca]]''. It comes from the Provençal word ''trobar'', the literal meaning of which is "to find", and the technical meaning of which is "to compose".<ref>Bruckner 1995, ''xi'' The French phrase "bien trouvé" ("well found")still denotes an apt expression.</ref> ''Trobairitz'' composed, wrote verses, and performed for the [[Occitania|Occitan]] [[noble court]]s. They are exceptional in musical history as the first known female composers of Western [[secular]] music; all earlier known female composers wrote [[sacred music]]. The ''trobairitz'' were part of courtly society, as opposed to their lower class counterparts the ''[[joglaresse]]''. Although troubadours frequently came from humble origins&mdash; [[Bernart de Ventadorn]] may have been the son of a castle's baker&mdash; the ''trobairitz'' were nobly born. The most important ''trobairitz'' are [[Alamanda de Castelnau]], [[Azalais de Porcairagues]], [[Maria de Ventadorn]], [[Tibors]], [[Castelloza]], [[Garsenda de Proença]], [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]], and the [[Comtessa de Dia]].

==Sources of information==
There are very few extant sources of information on the individual ''trobairitz''. Almost all information which exists about them come from their ''[[Vida (Occitan literary form)|vidas]]'' (biographies) and ''[[Razó (Occitan literary form)|razós]]'' (contextual explanations of the songs), the brief descriptions that were assembled in song collections called ''[[chansonnier]]s''. The ''vidas'' are notoriously unreliable, since they frequently consisted of little more than romanticized extrapolations from the poems of the ''trobairitz'' themselves.<ref name=Stephens>Stephens</ref>  The names of about twenty female poets from the 12th and 13th centuries survive, among whom between 23 and 46 works are attributed. Only one survives with [[musical notation]] intact, "A chantar" by Comtessa de Dia (see below). Some works which are anonymous in the sources are ascribed by certain modern editors to women, as are some works which are attributed to men in the manuscripts. For comparison, of the 460 male troubadours, about 2600 of their poems survive. Of these, about one in 10 survive with musical notation intact.<ref name=Stephens/>

The first chansonniers which contained their works did not separate the works of the male troubadours from those of the ''trobairitz''. It was only in later Italian and [[Catalonia|Catalan]] chansonniers that ''trobairitz'' were in a separate section of the books.<ref>Bruckner 1995, ''xxxiii''</ref>

==Position in medieval society==
[[Image:A chantar pg. 1crop.jpg|thumb|"A chantar" by Comtessa de Día (first page; see also [[:Image:A chantar pg. 2.jpg|second page]])]]
Throughout the 13th century, among the accomplishments necessary for a woman at court were the ability to sing, play instruments, and write ''jocs partis''<!--Jeu-parti, joc partit-->, or [[partimen]] (a debate or dialogue in the form of a poem). The cultivation of these womanly skills may have led to the writings of the ''trobairitz''.<ref name= "Women in music, 500-1500">Judith Tick. "Women in music, 500-1500", ''Grove Music Online''.</ref>

The ''trobairitz'' may also have been a result of the power women held in southern France during the 12th and 13th centuries. Women had far more control over land ownership, and Occitan society was far more accepting of women than were other societies of the time. During the [[Crusade]]s many men were away, which left women with more administrative responsibility, and thus power. Nevertheless, this society was not "feminist", nor was ''fin' amor'', which exalted women while at the same time circumscribing many aspects of their lives and behavior.<ref name="Bruckner article">Bruckner 1992</ref>

There is difficulty in labeling the ''trobairitz'' as either amateurs or professionals. The distinction between these two roles was complicated in the medieval era, since professionals were generally lower class, and amateurs had as much time as professionals to devote to their craft. ''Joglaresse'' were lower class, professional composers far less respected than the ''trobairitz''.<ref name="Bruckner article"/>

Both troubadours and ''trobairitz'' wrote of ''fin' amors'', or [[courtly love]]. Women were generally the subject of the writings of troubadours, however: "No other group of poets give women so exalted a definition within so tightly circumscribed a context of female suppression."<ref>"Troubadours, trouvères"</ref> The tension between the suppression of women present in the poetry of the troubadours and similar themes in the poetry of the ''trobairitz'' is a major source of discussion for modern commentators. The ''trobairitz'' wrote in the ''[[canso (song)|canso]]'' (strophic song) and ''[[tenso]]'' (debate poem) genres.

==Attribution==
The number of works attributed to the ''trobairitz'' ranges from 23 to 46. There are a number of reasons for this. In the courtly love tradition it was common for poems to be written as an exchange of letters, or a debate, as in a ''tenso''. Some of these may have been originally written by one poet; however, some were originally an actual exchange of [[epistle]]s, later gathered together in a manuscript.<ref>Dronke</ref> Some of these were between men, and some were between a man and a woman. Some modern editors attribute these solely to the man who originated the exchange, and some attribute them to both the man and the woman involved. There is a long history of attributing these solely to men, even when all evidence points to the contrary.<ref name=Dronke>Dronke, Peter. ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press (New York, 1984)</ref><ref name="Bruckner article"/>

Since poetry was highly stylized, it is difficult to determine when a poet speaking as a woman actually was a woman, or a man speaking as a woman. This adds to the difficulty of attribution, especially of [[anonymous]] writers. There is some debate as to whether or not the poems by the ''trobairitz'' represent  genuine feminine voices, since they worked within the highly circumscribed conventions of the troubadours.<ref name= "Women in music, 500-1500"/> Bruckner suggests that the ''trobairitz'' "spoke in her own voice as channeled through the voices of many others". By manipulating the strict constructs of troubadour lyric, the ''trobairitz'' were able to create their own "fictions of the female voice".<ref name="Bruckner article"/>

There is one notable instance where clear attribution is given to a woman, [[Bieiris de Romans]] (also given as Beatritz), but the subject of the poem is another woman, Na Maria. In the poem "Na Maria" Beatritz expresses her love for Maria in the traditional ''fin' amors'' style, both in terms of physical longing and courtly admiration.<ref name=Dronke/> This poem, if not clearly marked as by a woman, would be assumed to be by a man.
