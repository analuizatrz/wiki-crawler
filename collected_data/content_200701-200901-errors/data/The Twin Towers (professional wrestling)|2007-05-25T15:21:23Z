{{ distinguish|The Twin Towers }}
The '''Twin Towers''' were a [[Professional wrestling]] [[tag team]] consisting of Akeem "The African Dream" (formerly the [[One Man Gang]]) and [[Ray Traylor|Big Bossman]] from [[1988]] to [[1990]]. They were managed by [[Slick]] throughout their run as a team.

==Career==

The [[Big Bossman]] and [[One Man Gang]] had previously had a feud, giving [[Ray Traylor|Big Bossman]] the UWF title. Bossman then entered the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] in 1988 starting a feud with the arguable top [[face]] at that time [[Hulk Hogan]]. During this time Akeem & The Big Bossman formed a tag team and called themselves "Twin Towers" and were managed by Slick. The [[team]] both competed together and alone against the [[The Mega Powers]] (Hogan & Randy Savage). After the Mega Powers broke up, The Twin Towers turned their attention to the tag team division, feuding with the Rockers, [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]], and others. After [[Wrestlemania]] the team restarted their feud with Hogan, giving Bossman a [[WWE Championship|WWF Title]] shot, which he lost. Also at this time they teamed with Andre the Giant losing to [[Jim Duggan]] and Demolition at [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam 1989]].

==Break up==
Later that year [[The Twin Towers (professional wrestling)|The Twin Towers]] broke up and the Big Boss Man turned [[face]] , Akeem found his way out the WWF. This led to a match at [[WrestleMania VI]] in which the Bossman, without Slick, won over Akeem. Subsequently, The Boss Man later began teaming up with his former foe, [[Hulk Hogan]], against many forces.
