:''For similar disasters, see [[Fire of Moscow]]''
The '''1812 Fire of Moscow''' broke out on [[September 14]], [[1812]] in [[Moscow]] on the day when [[Russia]]n troops and most residents abandoned the city and [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s vanguard troops [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|entered the city]] following the [[Battle of Borodino]]. The fire raged until September 18, destroying an estimated three-quarters of Moscow.  

== Causes ==

Before leaving Moscow, Napoleon gave orders to have [[the Kremlin]] and major public buildings (including churches and monasteries) to be either blown up or set on fire. But this was not the foremost cause of the conflagration that destroyed the city. As the bulk of the French army moved into the city, there were some fires, which historians sympathetic to Napoleon's cause traditionally blame on Russian [[sabotage]]. It is believed that Moscow governor [[Fyodor Rostopchin]] had made preparations for anything that might have been of any use to the French army - food stores, granaries, warehouses and cloth stores - to be torched once the city was evacuated by the Russians.

[[La Grande Armée]], that set its position in a military camp manner and was carelessly looting sellable valuables, had also its share of responsibility: many buildings caught fire from bonfires they made for cooking. In any case, the catastrophe started as many small fires, which promptly grew out of control  and formed a massive blaze. Napoleon's police measures and executions of "arsonists" were put into effect after much of the city was already ablaze.

[[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], in ''[[War and Peace]]'', suggests that the fire was not deliberately set, either by the [[Russia]]ns or the [[France|French]]: the natural result of placing a wooden city in the hands of strangers in wintertime is that they will make small fires to stay warm, cook their food, and other benign purposes, and that some of those fires will get out of control. Without an efficient Fire Department, these house fires will spread to become neighborhood fires and ultimately a city-wide conflagration.

Dates in [[Old Style and New Style dates|Gregorian calendar (new style)]] and numbers referenced to [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] and [[Yevgeny Tarle|Tarle]]
* September 8 - Russian army began retreating east from Borodino.
* September 12 - Russian army, followed by [[Joachim Murat]]'s vanguard, set camp at [[Fili (Moscow)|Fili]]; Russian vanguard lodged in [[Dorogomilovo District|Dorogomilovo]]. Peak of civilian flight from Moscow. Next day, Russian military council at Fili agreed to abandon Moscow without fighting.
* [[September 14]] - Russian army marched through Moscow into an eastbound road to [[Ryazan]], followed by masses of civilians (Tarle). French army crossed [[Moskva River]] in three columns in Fili, Dorogomilovo and [[Luzhniki]], converging on the city center. Main body of [[La Grande Armée]] counted less than 90,000 men; Murat with some 25,000 troops was dispatched east to follow Russian retreat. His corps was the first to ride through the city, taking the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in the afternoon. Russian sources report first fires in abandoned city; French sources date first reports to Napoleon at dawn of the next day (Tarle). These early fires were localized at [[Kitai-gorod]], [[Solyanka Street]] and [[Tagansky District|Taganka]] (Katayeva) and did not slow down the French invasion of the city.
* September 15 - Massive fire in Kitai-gorod. Napoleon arrived at Kremlin.
* September 16 - Firestorm threatens Kremlin. Napoleon relocated to suburban Petrovsky Palace, breaking through the burning [[Arbat Street]] to Moskva river, then taking a safe route north-west by the river bank.
* [[September 18|September 17-18]] - Fire destroyed most of the city and settled down; Napoleon returned to Kremlin, expecting plea for peace from tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]].
* September 24 - French [[court-martial]] executed 10 first "saboteurs" (Tarle).
* [[October 19|October 18-19]] - French army left Moscow.

==Extent of the disaster==
[[Image:Fire_of_moscow_1812_1000px.jpg|thumb|left|1817 map, destroyed area shaded black]]

Katayeva summarized losses as 3/4 of all properties in the city:
* 6,496 of 9,151 private houses (this total included 6,584 wooden and 2,567 brick buildings)
* 8,251 retail shops and warehouses (including most of Kitai-gorod and [[Zamoskvorechye]] business districts)
* 122 of 329 churches (counting total losses only)

An estimated 2,000 wounded Russian soldiers perished in the fire. [[Moscow State University]], Buturlin's library, Petrovsky and Arbatsky theaters were completely destroyed; many pieces of art, notably the original of [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]], were lost forever.  The [[Moscow Orphanage]] near Kitai-gorod, converted to a hospital, was saved by local police. The population of Moscow in 1811 is estimated at 270,000; after the war, when residents returned to the city, it decreased to 215,000; by 1840, it had increased to 349,000 (Filippov). 

Maps compiled by Russian authorities after the war (notably the 1817 military map reprinted for the public in the 1831 guide book) show that the majority of Moscow territory had succumbed to the fire. Notable exceptions are [[Moscow Kremlin]], the Orphanage, northern segment of [[Bely Gorod]] from [[Tverskaya Street]] to [[Pokrovka Street]], [[Patriarshy Ponds]] in the west, as well as suburban settlements. 

The map probably exaggerates the damage, showing some surviving blocks as if they were destroyed. For instance, [[Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street]] west from [[Boulevard Ring]] retained many of its mansions: troops defended their own lodgings and the French theatre, as well as the French colony in [[Kuznetsky Most]]. On the other hand, French patronage did not help the Batashov Palace (present-day Yauzskaya Hospital), occupied by Murat's headquarters: after two days of firefighting, it was consumed by fire that razed [[Tagansky District|Taganka]]. Still, the remaining buildings had enough space for the French army. As General de Marbot reasoned, "It is often claimed that the fire of Moscow .. was the principal cause of the failure of the 1812 campaign. This assertion seems to me to be contestable. To begin with, the destruction of Moscow was not so complete that there did not remain enough houses, palaces, churches and barracks to accommodate the entire army" (for a whole month). However, many units were stationed not in the city, but in remote suburbs like [[Ostankino]] (light cavalry) or [[Khimki]] (Italian corps); others were dispatched south to screen Russian movements.

==Reconstruction of the city==

Shortage of funds, state and private, delayed reconstruction of Moscow by at least five years. In those years, many properties were sold by ruined owners, and whole neighborhoods changed their social status; for example, all properties on once-diverse [[Maroseika Street]] were bought out by merchant class (Sytin, p.105).

[[Image:Wiki_chernigovsky.jpg|thumb|right|Some 18th century buildings were rebuilt to original plans, but very few owners could afford it]]

The disaster allowed the authorities a unique opportunity to plan the city from scratch. In February, 1813, [[Alexander I of Russia]] set up the Commission of Building in Moscow, with the instruction to produce a viable master plan for the city. The 1813 plan by [[William Hastie]] was deemed inadequate for the task, thus the Commission hired numerous local architects and topographers who produced the final, 1817, master plan (incorporating Hastie's ideas of clearing the [[Central Squares of Moscow]]). In 1816-1830, city planners set up the [[Garden Ring]], a circular highway in place of an old fortification rampart, and widened many other streets. 

Later in 1817, the city held groundbreaking ceremony for [[Alexander Witberg]]'s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, a monument to the 1812 War in [[Sparrow Hills]]. This project was later canceled and the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour|actual Cathedral]] emerged in the center of Moscow.

Reconstruction of [[Red Square]] and [[Kitai-gorod]] was handled by [[Joseph Bove]], who designed the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] Upper Trade Rows as a mirror of [[Matvey Kazakov]]'s [[Kremlin Senate]]. In February 1818, [[Ivan Martos]] completed the [[Monument to Minin and Pozharsky]], the first public monument in Moscow, placed in the center of Red Square. Bove also designed the symmetrical [[Theatre Square]] and completed [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi]] and [[Maly Theatre|Maly]] theaters by 1825. Moscow University and other public buildings were rebuilt by [[Domenico Giliardi]] and [[Afanasy Grigoriev]]. 

Bove also handled the "façade department", authorizing façade designs for all new buildings. A severe shortage of brick, stone and cement forced many developers to build in wood; the city had to agree with the inevitable, on condition that the houses follow the neoclassical standards. Local craftsmen responded with mass-produced wooden imitations of classical ornaments. Most of these houses were eventually destroyed. Extant examples include a recently restored house on the corner of Glazovsky and Denezhny Lanes in [[Arbat District]], and [[Vasily Pushkin]] house in [[Staraya Basmannaya Street]].
