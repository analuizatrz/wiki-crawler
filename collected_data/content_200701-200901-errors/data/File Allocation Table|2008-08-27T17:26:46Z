'''File Allocation Table''' or '''FAT''' is a computer [[file system]] architecture originally developed by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Marc McDonald]] in 1976/1977.<ref name=MSJsept1989> [http://cd.textfiles.com/megademo2/INFO/OS2_HPFS.TXT Microsoft Systems Journal  Sept 1989  v4 n5 p1(13)] </ref><ref name=fathist> [http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.microsoft.com/mscorp/ip/tech/fathist.asp www.microsoft.com/mscorp/ip/tech/fathist.asp] (archive.org) </ref>
It is the primary file system for various [[operating systems]] including [[DR-DOS]], [[OpenDOS]], 
[[freeDOS]], [[MS-DOS]], [[OS/2]](v1.1), and [[Microsoft Windows]] (up to [[Windows Me]]).
For [[floppy disk]]s (FAT12 and FAT16 without [[long filename]] support) it has been standardized as [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-107<ref name="Ecma-107"> [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-107.htm standards - Ecma-107]</ref> and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 9293.<ref> [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=16948 standards - ISO 9293:1987] </ref><ref> [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=21273 standards - ISO/IEC 9293:1994] </ref> The use of [[long filename]]s with FAT is [[patent]]ed in part.

The FAT file system is relatively straightforward and is supported by virtually all existing [[operating system]]s for [[personal computer]]s. This makes it an ideal format for [[solid-state_drive|solid-state]] [[memory card]]s and a convenient way to share data between [[operating system]]s.

Common implementations have a serious drawback in that when files are deleted and new files written to the media, directory [[Fragmentation (computer)|fragments]] tend to become scattered over the entire disk, making reading and writing slower on storage devices, which have lower seek time for random data access (Such as mechanical hard drives). Manually-invoked periodic [[defragmentation]] is one solution to this problem, but is often a lengthy process, and unwise in some instances. Due to a limited number of lifetime writes, and their quick access times, solid-state memory cards should usually not be defragmented.
__TOC__

== History ==
The FAT file system was created for managing disks in [[Microsoft BASIC|Microsoft Standalone Disk BASIC]]. In August 1980 [[Tim Paterson]] incorporated FAT into his [[86-DOS]] operating system for the [[S-100 bus|S-100]] [[8086]] CPU boards;<ref name="dgaiotnhpfs">{{cite web | url=http://cd.textfiles.com/megademo2/INFO/OS2_HPFS.TXT | title=Design goals and implementation of the new High Performance File System | author=Duncan, Ray | year=1989 | publisher=Microsoft Systems Journal | volume=4 | issue=5 }} [Note: This particular text file has a number of 'scan' errors; e.g., "Ray" is the author's correct name; not 'Roy' as text shows.]</ref> the file system was the main difference between 86-DOS and its predecessor, [[CP/M]].

The name originates from the usage of a table which centralizes the information about which areas belong to files, are free or possibly unusable, and where each file is stored on the disk. To limit the size of the table, disk space is allocated to files in contiguous groups of [[Disk sector|hardware sectors]] called ''[[Cluster (file system)|cluster]]s''. As disk drives have evolved, the maximum number of clusters has dramatically increased, and so the number of bits to identify a cluster has grown. The successive major versions of the FAT format are named after the number of table element bits:  12, 16, and 32.  The FAT standard has also been expanded in other ways while preserving backward compatibility with existing software.

=== FAT12 ===
This initial version of FAT is now referred to as '''FAT12'''. Designed as a file system for floppy diskettes, it limited cluster addresses to 12-bit values, which not only limited the cluster count to 4078,<ref> {{cite book

}}).</ref>) The disk's size is stored as a 16-bit count of [[Cylinder-head-sector|sector]]s, which limited the size to 32 [[MB]]<ref name=prefix>File allocation is specified using [[binary prefix|binary meanings]] for K (1024<sup>1</sup> instead of 1000<sup>1</sup>), M (1024<sup>2</sup> instead of 1000<sup>2</sup>), G (1024<sup>3</sup> instead of 1000<sup>3</sup>), ... </ref>. FAT12 was used by several manufacturers with different physical formats, but a typical floppy diskette at the time was 5.25-inch, single-sided, 40 [[Cylinder-head-sector|track]]s, with 8 sectors per track, resulting in a capacity of 160 [[KB]] for both the system areas and files. The FAT12 limitations exceeded this capacity by one or more [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]].  The limits were successively lifted in the following years which increased storage capacity dramatically but eventually rendered FAT12 obsolete.

By convention all the control structures were organized to fit inside the first track, thus avoiding head movement during read and write operations, although this varied depending on the manufacturer and physical format of the disk. At the time FAT12 was introduced, DOS did not support hierarchical directories, and the maximum number of files was typically limited to a few dozen.

A limitation which was not addressed until much later was that any bad sector in the control structures area, track 0, could prevent the diskette from being usable. The DOS formatting tool rejected such diskettes completely. Bad sectors were allowed only in the file area, where they made the entire holding cluster unusable as well.

=== Directories ===
=== Initial FAT16 ===
In 1984 IBM released the [[PC AT]], which featured a 20 MB hard disk. Microsoft introduced MS-DOS 3.0 in parallel. Cluster addresses were increased to 16-bit, allowing for up to 65,517 clusters per volume, and consequently much greater file system sizes. However, the maximum possible number of sectors and the maximum ([[Disk partitioning|partition]], rather than disk) size of 32 MB did not change. Therefore, although technically already "FAT16", this format was not what today is commonly understood as FAT16. A 20 MB hard disk formatted under MS-DOS 3.0 was not accessible by the older MS-DOS 2.0. Of course, MS-DOS 3.0 could still access MS-DOS 2.0 style 8 KB cluster partitions.

MS-DOS 3.0 also introduced support for high-density 1.2 MB 5.25" diskettes, which notably had 15 sectors per track, hence more space for FAT. This probably prompted a dubious optimization of the cluster size, which went down from 2 sectors to just 1. The net effect was that high density diskettes were significantly slower than older ''double density'' ones.{{dubious}} <!-- this was probably caused by the interleave being reduced to one and many disk drives not being able to keep up -->

=== Extended partition and logical drives ===
Apart from improving the structure of the FAT file system itself, a parallel development allowing an increase in the maximum possible FAT size was the introduction of multiple FAT partitions. Originally partitions were supposed to be used only for sharing the disk between operating systems, typically DOS and [[Xenix]] at the time, so DOS was only prepared to handle one FAT partition. It was not possible to create multiple DOS partitions using DOS tools, and third party tools would warn that such a scheme would not be compatible with DOS. Simply allowing several identical-looking DOS partitions could lead to naming problems: should C: be the first FAT partition on disk, for simplicity, or rather the partition marked as ''active'' in the partition table, so that several DOS versions can co-exist? And which partition should be C: if the system was booted from a diskette?

To allow the use of more FAT partitions in a compatible way, a new partition type was introduced (in MS-DOS 3.2, January 1986), the ''[[Extended Boot Record|extended partition]]''; which is a container for additional partitions called ''logical drives''. Originally only one logical drive was possible, permitting hard disks up to 64 MB. In MS-DOS 3.3 (August 1987) this limit was increased to 24 drives; it probably came from the compulsory letter-based disk naming (A and B being reserved for the two floppy drives, with which many, if not most, systems of the era were equipped). Logical drives are described by on-disk structures which closely resemble the [[Master Boot Record]] (MBR) of the disk (which describes the ''primary'' partitions), likely to simplify the implementation. Though some believe these partitions were ''nested'' in a way analogous to Russian [[matryoshka doll]]s, that isn't the case. They are stored as a row of separate blocks within a single box; these blocks are often referred to as being ''chained'' together, by the ''links'' in their [[extended boot record]] (EBR) sectors. Only one extended partition is allowed. Logical drives are not bootable, and the extended partition can only be created after the primary FAT partition (except with third party formatting tools), which remove all ambiguity, but also the possibility of booting several DOS versions from the same hard disk.

A useful side-effect of the extended partition scheme was to significantly increase the maximum number of partitions possible on a PC hard disk beyond the four which could be described by the MBR alone.

Prior to the introduction of extended partitions, some hard disk controllers (which at that time were separate option boards, since the [[Advanced Technology Attachment|IDE]] standard did not yet exist) could make large hard disks appear as two separate disks.

=== Final FAT16 ===
Finally in November 1987, [[Compaq]] DOS 3.31 introduced what is today called the ''FAT16'' format, with the expansion of the 16-bit disk sector count to 32 bits.  The result was initially called the ''DOS 3.31 Large File System''.  Although the on-disk changes were minor, the entire DOS disk driver had to be converted to use 32-bit sector numbers, a task complicated by the fact that it was written in 16-bit [[assembly language]].

In 1988 the improvement became more generally available through MS-DOS 4.0 and [[OS/2]] 1.1.  The limit on partition size was dictated by the 8-bit [[Signedness|signed]] count of sectors-per-cluster, which had a maximum power-of-two value of 64.  With the standard hard disk sector size of 512 bytes, this gives a maximum of 32 KB clusters, thereby fixing the "definitive" limit for the FAT16 partition size at 2 [[gigabyte]]s.  On [[magneto-optical]] media, which can have 1 or 2 KB sectors, the limit is proportionally greater.

Much later, [[Windows NT]] increased the maximum cluster size to 64 KB by considering the sectors-per-cluster count as unsigned. However, the resulting format was not compatible with any other FAT implementation of the time, and it generated greater [[fragmentation (computer)#Internal fragmentation|internal fragmentation]].  [[Windows 98]] <!--  what about 95?  --> also supported reading and writing this variant, but its disk utilities did not work with it.

The number of root directory entries available is determined when the volume is formatted, and is stored in a 16-bit signed field setting an absolute limit of 32767 entries (32736, a multiple of 32, in practice).<!-- according to the talk page this is from the MBR spec, does anyone know how to cite that-->  For historical reasons, FAT12 and FAT16 media generally use 512 root directory entries on non-floppy media.  Other sizes may be incompatible with some software or devices (entries being file and/or folder names in the original 8.3 format).<ref> {{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/120138 | title=Errors Creating Files or Folders in the Root Directory | publisher=Microsoft Help and Support | date=[[December 16]],[[2004]] | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref> Some third party tools like [[mkdosfs]] allow the user to set this parameter.<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man8/mkdosfs.8.html | title=mkdosfs man page}} </ref>

=== Long file names ===
One of the [[user experience]] goals for the designers of [[Windows 95]] was the ability to use [[long filename]]s (LFNs—up to 255 UTF-16 code points <!-- N.B. every 16-bit Unicode value consumes one spot, regardless of whether it is a whole character, a modifier, or other incomplete character --> long), in addition to classic [[8.3 filename]]s.  LFNs were implemented using a [[Workaround|work-around]] in the way directory entries are laid out (see below). The version of the file system with this extension is usually known as VFAT after the Windows 95 [[VxD]] device driver, also known as "Virtual FAT" in Microsoft's documentation.

Interestingly, the VFAT driver actually appeared before Windows 95, in [[Windows for Workgroups]] 3.11, but was only used for implementing [[32-bit File Access]], a higher performance [[protected mode]] file access method, bypassing DOS and directly using either the [[BIOS]], or, better, the Windows-native protected mode disk drivers.

In Windows NT, support for long filenames on FAT started from version [[Windows NT 3.5|3.5]]. [[OS/2]] added long filename support to FAT using [[extended attributes]] (EA) before the introduction of VFAT; thus, VFAT long filenames are invisible to OS/2, and EA long filenames are invisible to Windows.

===FAT32 (VFAT)===
In order to overcome the volume size limit of FAT16, while still allowing DOS [[real mode]] code to handle the format without unnecessarily reducing the available [[conventional memory]], Microsoft implemented a newer generation of FAT, known as '''FAT32''', with cluster values held in a 32-bit field, of which 28 bits are used to hold the cluster number, for a maximum of approximately 268 million (2<SUP>28</SUP>) clusters. This allows for drive sizes of up to 8 [[terabyte]]s with 32KB clusters, but the boot sector uses a 32-bit field for the sector count, limiting volume size to 2 TB on a hard disk with 512 byte sectors.

On Windows 95/98, due to the version of Microsoft's [[SCANDISK]] utility included with these operating systems being a 16-bit application, the FAT structure is not allowed to grow beyond around 4.2 million (< 2<SUP>22</SUP>) clusters, placing the volume limit at 127.53 [[gigabyte]]s.<ref name=MSKB184006>{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/184006/en-us | title=Limitations of FAT32 File System | publisher=Microsoft Help and Support | date=2004-12-16 | accessdate=2006-10-14 }}</ref> A limitation in original versions of Windows 98/98SE's Fdisk utility causes it to incorrectly report disk sizes over 64GB.<ref name=MSKB263044>{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/263044 | title=Fdisk Does Not Recognize Full Size of Hard Disks Larger than 64 GB | publisher=Microsoft Help and Support | date=2007-01-27 | accessdate=2007-03-08 }}</ref>  A corrected version is available from Microsoft. These limitations do not apply to Windows 2000/XP except during Setup, in which there is a 32GB limit.<ref name=MSKB314463>{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314463/en-us | title=Limitations of the FAT32 File System in Windows XP | publisher=Microsoft Help and Support | date=2002-09-04 | accessdate=2007-01-24 }}</ref> Windows Me supports the FAT32 file system without any limits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allensmith.net/Storage/HDDlimit/FAT32.htm | title=Windows XP/2000 FAT32 Formatting Limit | publisher=allensmith.net | accessdate=2007-04-08 }}</ref> However, similarly to windows 95/98SE there is no native support for 48bit LBA in Windows ME, meaning that the maximum disk size is 127.6GB

FAT32 was introduced with Windows 95 OSR2, although reformatting was needed to use it, and [[DoubleSpace#DriveSpace in Windows 95|DriveSpace 3]] (the version that came with Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98<!--  what about ME?  -->) never supported it. Windows 98 introduced a utility to convert existing hard disks from FAT16 to FAT32 without loss of data. In the NT line, native support for FAT32 arrived in [[Windows 2000]]. A free FAT32 driver for [[Windows NT 4.0]] was available from [[Winternals]], a company later acquired by Microsoft. Since the acquisition the driver is no longer officially available.

Windows 2000 and [[Windows XP]] can read and write to FAT32 file systems of any size, but the format program included in Windows 2000 and higher can only create FAT32 file systems of 32 GB or less. This limitation is by design and according to Microsoft was imposed because many tasks on a very large FAT32 file system become slow and inefficient.<ref name=MSKB184006/><ref name="TechNet on FAT32">Chen, Raymond (2006).  [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/07/WindowsConfidential/ Microsoft TechNet: A Brief and Incomplete History of FAT32]. ''TechNet Magazine'' July 2006''.</ref> This limitation can be bypassed by using third-party formatting utilities or by using the built-in FORMAT.EXE command-line utility.<ref>[http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?fat32format.htm Fat32Format] - Windows program for formatting disks as FAT32 beyond the 32GB limit.</ref><ref>[http://www.gearhack.com/Forums/DisplayComments.php?file=Computer/Windows/Format_Large_Disks_to_FAT32_on_Windows_XP_and_Vista Format Large Disks to FAT32 on Windows XP and Vista]</ref>

The maximum possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GB minus 1 "null" byte (2<SUP>32</SUP>&minus;1 bytes). Video applications, large databases, and some other software easily exceed this limit. Larger files require another formatting type such as [[HFS Plus|HFS+]] or [[NTFS]]. Until mid-2006, those who run [[dual boot]] systems or who move external data drives between computers with different operating systems had little choice but to stick with FAT32. Since then, full support for NTFS has become available in Linux and many other operating systems, by installing the [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE library]] (on Linux) together with the [[NTFS-3G]] driver. Data exchange is also possible between Windows and Linux by using the Linux-native [[ext2]] or [[ext3]] file systems through the use of external drivers for Windows, such as ext2 IFS; however, Windows cannot boot from ext2 or ext3 partitions.

===Fragmentation===
The FAT file system does not contain mechanisms which prevent newly written files from becoming scattered across the partition.<ref name="dgaiotnhpfs" /> Other file systems, like [[HPFS]], use free space bitmaps that indicate used and available clusters, which could then be quickly looked up in order to find free contiguous areas (improved in [[exFAT]]). Another solution is the linkage of all free clusters into one or more lists (as is done in [[Unix]] file systems). Instead, the FAT has to be scanned as an array to find free clusters, which can lead to performance penalties with large hard disks.

In fact, computing free disk space on FAT is one of the most resource intensive operations, as it requires reading the entire FAT linearly. A possible justification suggested by Microsoft's [[Raymond Chen]] for limiting the maximum size of FAT32 partitions created on Windows was the time required to perform a "DIR" operation, which always displays the free disk space as the last line.<ref name="TechNet on FAT32"/> Displaying this line took longer and longer as the number of clusters increased.

The High Performance File System (HPFS) divides disk space into ''bands'', which have their own free space bitmap, where multiple files opened for simultaneous write could be expanded separately.<ref name="dgaiotnhpfs" />

Some of the perceived problems with [[Fragmentation (computer)|fragmentation]] resulted from operating system and hardware limitations.

The single-tasking DOS and the traditionally single-tasking PC hard disk architecture ([[Native Command Queuing|only 1 outstanding input/output request at a time]], [[Programmed input/output|no DMA transfers]]) did not contain mechanisms which could alleviate fragmentation by asynchronously prefetching next data while the application was processing the previous chunks.

Similarly, write-behind caching was often not enabled by default with Microsoft software (if present) given the problem of data loss in case of a crash, made easier by the lack of hardware protection between applications and the system.

MS-DOS also did not offer a system call which would allow applications to make sure a particular file has been completely written to disk in the presence of deferred writes (cf. [[Sync (Unix)|fsync]] in Unix or DosBufReset in [[OS/2]]). Disk caches on MS-DOS were operating on disk block level and were not aware of higher-level structures of the file system. In this situation, cheating with regard to the real progress of a disk operation was most dangerous.

Modern operating systems have introduced these optimizations to FAT partitions, but optimizations can still produce unwanted artifacts in case of a system crash. A Windows NT system will allocate space to files on FAT in advance, selecting large contiguous areas, but in case of a crash, files which were being appended will appear larger than they were ever written into, with dozens of random kilobytes at the end.

With the large cluster sizes, 16 or 32K, forced by larger FAT32 partitions, the ''external'' fragmentation becomes somewhat less significant, and ''internal'' fragmentation, ie. disk space waste (since files are rarely exact multiples of cluster size), starts to be a problem as well, especially when there are a great many small files.

=== Third party support ===
Other IBM PC operating systems&mdash;such as [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[BeOS]] and [[JNode]]&mdash;have all supported FAT, and most added support for VFAT, FAT32, [http://www.jnode.org/node/844 JFAT] shortly after the corresponding Windows versions were released.  Early Linux distributions also supported a format known as [[UMSDOS]], which was FAT with Unix file attributes (such as long file name and access permissions) stored in a separate file called “<tt>--linux-.---</tt>”.  UMSDOS fell into disuse after VFAT was released and is not enabled by default in [[Linux kernel]]s from version 2.5.7 onwards.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/ChangeLog-2.5.7 | title=Release notes for v2.5.7 | publisher=The Linux Kernel archives | date=2002-03-12 | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref>  The [[Mac OS X]] operating system also supports the FAT file systems on volumes other than the [[boot disk]]. The [[Amiga]] supports FAT through the [[CrossDOS]] file system.

=== FAT and Alternate Data Streams ===
The FAT file system itself is not designed for supporting Alternate Data Streams ([[Fork (filesystem)|ADS]]), but some operating systems that heavily depend on them have devised various methods for handling them in FAT drives.  Such methods either store the additional information in extra files and directories (Mac OS), or give new semantics to previously unused fields of the FAT on-disk data structures (OS/2 and Windows NT).  The second design, while presumably more efficient, prevents any copying or backing-up of those volumes using non-aware tools; manipulating such volumes using non-aware disk utilities (e.g. defragmenters or [[CHKDSK]]) will probably lose the information.

[[Mac OS]] using [[PC Exchange]] stores its various dates, file attributes and long filenames in a [[hidden file]] called FINDER.DAT, and [[resource fork]]s (a common Mac OS ADS) in a subdirectory called RESOURCE.FRK, in every directory where they are used.  From PC Exchange 2.1 onwards, they store the Mac OS long filenames as standard FAT long filenames and convert FAT filenames longer than 31 characters to unique 31-character filenames, which can then be made visible to Macintosh applications.

Mac OS X stores resource forks and metadata (file attributes, other ADS) in a hidden file with a name constructed from the owner filename prefixed with "._", and Finder stores some folder and file metadata in a hidden file called "[[.DS Store]]".

[[OS/2]] heavily depends on [[extended attribute]]s (EAs) and stores them in a hidden file called "EA&nbsp;DATA.&nbsp;SF" in the root directory of the FAT12 or FAT16 volume.  This file is indexed by 2 previously reserved bytes in the file's (or directory's) directory entry.  In the FAT32 format, these bytes hold the upper 16 bits of the starting cluster number of the file or directory, hence making it difficult to store EAs on FAT32.  Extended attributes are accessible via the [[Workplace Shell]] desktop, through [[REXX]] scripts, and many system [[graphical user interface|GUI]] and [[CLI|command-line]] utilities (such as [[4DOS|4OS2]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tavi.co.uk/os2pages/eadata.html | title=Implementation of extended attributes on the FAT file system | author=Bob Eager | work=Tavi OS/2 pages | date=2000-10-28 | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref>

To accommodate its [[OS/2]] subsystem, [[Windows NT]] supports the handling of extended attributes in [[High Performance File System|HPFS]], [[NTFS]], and FAT.  It stores EAs on FAT and HPFS using exactly the same scheme as OS/2, but does not support any other kind of ADS as held on NTFS volumes.  Trying to copy a file with any ADS other than EAs from an NTFS volume to a FAT or HPFS volume gives a warning message with the names of the ADSs that will be lost.

Windows 2000 onward acts exactly as Windows NT, except that it ignores EAs when copying to FAT32 without any warning (but shows the warning for other ADSs, like "Macintosh Finder Info" and "Macintosh Resource Fork").

=== Future ===
Microsoft has recently secured patents for VFAT and FAT32 (but not the original FAT). Despite two earlier rulings against them, Microsoft prevailed and was awarded the patents.

Since Microsoft has announced the discontinuation of its [[MS-DOS]]-based consumer operating systems with [[Windows Me]], it remains unlikely that any new versions of FAT will appear. For most purposes, the [[NTFS]] file system that was developed for the Windows NT line is superior to FAT from the points of view of efficiency, performance, and reliability; its main drawbacks are the size overhead for small volumes and the very limited support by anything other than the NT-based versions of Windows, since the exact specification is a [[trade secret]] of Microsoft. The availability of [[NTFS-3G]] since mid 2006 has led to much improved NTFS support in [[Unix-like]] operating systems, considerably alleviating this concern. It is still not possible to use NTFS in DOS-like operating systems, which in turn makes it difficult to use a DOS floppy for recovery purposes. Microsoft provided a [[Recovery Console|recovery console]] to work around this issue, but for security reasons it severely limited what could be done through the Recovery Console by default. The movement of recovery utilities to boot CDs based on [[BartPE]] or Linux (with NTFS-3G) is finally eroding this drawback.

FAT is still the normal file system for removable media (with the exception of CDs and DVDs), with FAT12 used on floppies, and FAT16 on most other removable media (such as [[flash memory]] cards for [[digital camera]]s and [[USB]] flash drives). Most removable media are not yet large enough to benefit from FAT32<!--presumably those that are like IOMEGA REV normally get used with fat32 but i don't have any around to check [[User:Plugwash|Plugwash]] 13:59, 8 September 2005 (UTC)-->, although some larger flash drives<!--others?-->, like [[Secure Digital High-Capacity|SDHC]], do make use of it. FAT16 is used on these drives for reasons of compatibility and size overhead.

The FAT32 formatting support in Windows 2000 and XP is limited to volumes of 32 GB, which effectively forces users of modern hard drives either to use [[NTFS]], to partition the drive into smaller volumes (below 32 GB), or to format the drive using third party tools.

===exFAT===
{{main|exFAT}}

exFAT is an incompatible replacement for FAT file systems that was introduced with [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]]. It is intended to be used on [[USB flash drive|flash drives]], where FAT is used today. Windows XP file system drivers will be offered by Microsoft shortly after the release of Windows CE 6.0{{Fact|date=September 2007}}, while [[Windows Vista Service Pack 1]] added exFAT support to Windows Vista.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> exFAT introduces a free space bitmap allowing faster space allocation and faster deletes, support for files up to 2<sup>64</sup> bytes, larger cluster sizes (up to 32 MB in the first implementation), an extensible directory structure and name hashes for filenames for faster comparisons. It does not have short 8.3 filenames anymore. It does not appear to have security [[access control list]]s or [[journaling file system|file system journaling]] like NTFS, though device manufacturers can choose to implement simplified support for transactions (backup file allocation table used for the write operations, primary FAT for storing last known good allocation table).

==Design==

The following is an overview of the order of structures in a FAT partition or disk:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" cellpadding="20"
| Boot<br/> sector
| More reserved<br/> sectors<br/> (optional)
| File<br/> Allocation<br/> Table #1
| File<br/> Allocation<br/> Table #2
| Root<br/> Directory<br/> (FAT12/16 only)
| Data Region (for files and directories) ...<br/> (To end of partition or disk)
|}

A FAT file system is composed of four different sections.

# The '''Reserved sectors''', located at the very beginning. The first reserved sector is the [[Boot sector|Boot Sector]] (aka ''Partition Boot Record''). It includes an area called the ''[[BIOS parameter block|BIOS Parameter Block]]'' (with some basic file system information, in particular its type, and pointers to the location of the other sections) and usually contains the operating system's [[boot loader]] code. The total count of reserved sectors is indicated by a field inside the Boot Sector. Important information from the Boot Sector is accessible through an operating system structure called the ''Drive Parameter Block'' in DOS and OS/2. For FAT32 file systems, the reserved sectors include a ''Backup Boot Sector'' at Sector 6.
# The '''FAT Region'''. This typically contains two copies (may vary) of the ''File Allocation Table'' for the sake of redundancy checking, although the extra copy is rarely used, even by disk repair utilities. These are maps of the Data Region, indicating which clusters are used by files and directories.
# The '''Root Directory Region'''. This is a ''Directory Table'' that stores information about the files and directories located in the root directory. It is only used with FAT12 and FAT16 and means that the root directory has a fixed maximum size which is pre-allocated at creation of this volume. FAT32 stores the root directory in the Data Region along with files and other directories instead, allowing it to grow without such a restraint.
# The '''Data Region'''. This is where the actual file and directory data is stored and takes up most of the partition. The size of files and subdirectories can be increased arbitrarily (as long as there are free clusters) by simply adding more links to the file's chain in the FAT. Note however, that files are allocated entirely in a cluster, and so if a 1 KB file resides in a 32 KB cluster, 31 KB are wasted.

FAT uses [[Endianness|little endian]] format for entries in the header and the FAT(s).

====Exceptions====
The implementation of FAT used in [[MS-DOS]] for the [[Apricot PC]] had a different boot sector layout, to accommodate that computer's non-IBM compatible BIOS. The jump instruction and OEM name were omitted, and the MS-DOS file system parameters (offsets 0x0B - 0x17 in the standard sector) were located at offset 0x50. Later versions of Apricot MS-DOS gained the ability to read and write disks with the standard boot sector in addition to those with the Apricot one.

[[DOS Plus]] on the [[BBC Master]] 512 did not use conventional boot sectors at all. Data disks omitted the boot sector and began with a single copy of the FAT (the first byte of the FAT was used to determine disk capacity) while boot disks began with a miniature [[Advanced Disc Filing System|ADFS]] file system containing the boot loader, followed by a single FAT. It could also access standard PC disks formatted to 180 KB or 360 KB, again using the first byte of the FAT to determine capacity.

===File Allocation Table===
A partition is divided up into identically sized '''clusters''', small blocks of contiguous space. Cluster sizes vary depending on the type of FAT file system being used and the size of the partition, typically cluster sizes lie somewhere between 2 KB and 32 KB. Each file may occupy one or more of these clusters depending on its size; thus, a file is represented by a chain of these clusters (referred to as a [[Linked list#Singly-linked list|singly linked list]]). However these clusters are not necessarily stored adjacent to one another on the disk's surface but are often instead ''fragmented'' throughout the Data Region.

The '''File Allocation Table''' ('''FAT''') is a list of entries that map to each cluster on the partition. Each entry records one of five things:
* the cluster number of the next cluster in a chain
* a special ''end of clusterchain'' (''EOC'') entry that indicates the end of a chain
* a special entry to mark a bad cluster
* a special entry to mark a reserved cluster{{Fact|date=July 2007}}<!-- which microsoft document mentions this? -->
* a zero to note that the cluster is unused

Each version of the FAT file system uses a different size for FAT entries. The size is indicated by the name, for example the FAT16 file system uses 16 bits for each entry while the FAT32 file system uses 32 bits. Only 28 of these are actually used, however. This difference means that the File Allocation Table of a FAT32 system can map a greater number of clusters than FAT16, allowing for larger partition sizes with FAT32. This also allows for more efficient use of space than FAT16, because on the same hard drive a FAT32 table can address smaller clusters which means less wasted space.

FAT entry values:
{| class="wikitable"
!width="5%"|FAT12
!width="5%"|FAT16
!width="7%"|FAT32
!width="20%"|Description
|-
|0x000

|Bad sector in cluster or reserved cluster
|-
|0xFF8 - 0xFFF
|0xFFF8 - 0xFFFF
|0x?FFFFFF8 - 0x?FFFFFFF
|Last cluster in file
|}

Note that FAT32 uses only 28 bits of the 32 possible bits. The upper 4 bits are usually zero but are reserved and should be left untouched. In the table above these are denoted by a question mark.

The first cluster of the Data Region is cluster #2. That leaves the first two entries of the FAT unused. In the first byte of the first entry a copy of the media descriptor is stored. The remaining 8 bits (if FAT16), or 20 bits (if Fat32) of this entry are 1. In the second entry the end-of-cluster-chain marker is stored. The high order two bits of the second entry are sometimes, in the case of FAT16 and FAT32, used for dirty volume management: high order bit 1: last shutdown was clean; next highest bit 1: during the previous mount no disk I/O errors were detected.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/fs/fat/fat-1.html | title=The FAT filesystem | author=Andries E. Brouwer | date=2002-09-20 | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref>

===Directory table===
A '''directory table''' is a special type of file that represents a directory (also known as a folder). Each file or directory stored within it is represented by a 32-byte entry in the table. Each entry records the name, extension, attributes ([[archive bit|archive]], directory, hidden, read-only, system and volume), the date and time of creation, the address of the first cluster of the file/directory's data and finally the size of the file/directory.
Aside from the Root Directory Table in FAT12 and FAT16 file systems, which occupies the special ''Root Directory Region'' location, all Directory Tables are stored in the Data Region.  The actual number of entries in a directory stored in the Data Region can grow by adding another cluster to the chain in the FAT.

Legal characters for DOS file names include the following:
* Upper case letters <tt>A</tt>&ndash;<tt>Z</tt>
* Numbers <tt>0</tt>&ndash;<tt>9</tt>
* Space (though trailing spaces in either the base name or the extension are considered to be padding and not a part of the file name, also filenames with space in them could not be used on the DOS command line because of the lack of a suitable escaping system)
* <tt>! # $ % & ' ( ) - @ ^ _ ` { } ~  </tt>
* (FAT-32 only) <tt>+ , . ; = [ ]</tt>
* Values 128&ndash;255

This excludes the following [[ASCII]] characters:
* <tt>" * / : < > ? \ | </tt><br>Windows/MSDOS has no shell [[escape character#Bourne shell|escape character]]
* Lower case letters <tt>a</tt>&ndash;<tt>z</tt><br>stored as <tt>A</tt>&ndash;<tt>Z</tt> on FAT-12/16
* Control characters 0&ndash;31
* Value 127 (DEL)

The DOS file names are in the [[Code page|OEM character set]].

Directory entries, both in the Root Directory Region and in subdirectories, are of the following format:

|-
|align="right"|0x00

Clusters are numbered from a cluster offset as defined above.  That is, a zero in 0x1a would mean the first data segment is at:

reservedSectors + (noofFAT * sectors2FAT) + (maxRootEntry * 32 / bytes2sector) -2;

==== Long file names ====

Long File Names (LFN) are stored on a FAT file system using a trick&mdash;adding (possibly multiple) additional directory entries into the file allocation table before the normal file entry. The additional entries are marked with the Volume Label, System, Hidden, and Read Only attributes (yielding 0x0F), which is a combination that is not expected in the MS-DOS environment, and therefore ignored by MS-DOS programs and third-party utilities. Notably, a directory containing only volume labels is considered as empty and is allowed to be deleted; such a situation appears if files created with long names are deleted from plain DOS. 

A [[checksum]] also allows verification of whether a long file name matches the 8.3 name; such a mismatch could occur if a file was deleted and re-created using DOS in the same directory position. The checksum is calculated using the algorithm below. (Note that pFcbName is a pointer to the name as it appears in a regular directory entry, i.e. the first eight characters are the filename, and the last three are the extension. The dot is implicit. Any unused space in the filename is padded with spaces (ASCII 0x20) char. For example, "Readme.txt" would be <tt>"README&nbsp;&nbsp;TXT"</tt>.)

<source lang="c">
unsigned char lfn_checksum(const unsigned char *pFcbName)
{
	int i;
	unsigned char sum=0;
	
	for (i=11; i; i--)
		sum = ((sum & 1) << 7) + (sum >> 1) + *pFcbName++;
	return sum;
}
</source>

Older versions of PC-DOS mistake LFN names in the root directory for the volume label, and are likely to display an incorrect label.

Each phony entry can contain up to 13 [[UTF-16]] characters (26 bytes) by using fields in the record which contain file size or time stamps (but not the starting cluster field, for compatibility with disk utilities, the starting cluster field is set to a value of 0. See [[8.3 filename]] for additional explanations). Up to 20 of these 13-character entries may be chained, supporting a maximum length of 255 UTF-16 characters.<ref name="LongSpec" />

After the last [[UTF-16]] character, a 0x00 0x00 is added. Other not used characters are filled with 0xFF 0xFF.

LFN entries use the following format:

If a filename contains only lowercase letters, or is a combination of a lowercase ''basename'' with an uppercase ''extension'', or vice-versa; and has no special characters, and fits within the 8.3 limits, a VFAT entry is not created on Windows NT and later versions such as XP. Instead, two bits in byte 0x0c of the directory entry are used to indicate that the filename should be considered as entirely or partially lowercase. Specifically, bit 4 means lowercase ''extension'' and bit 3 lowercase ''basename'', which allows for combinations such as "<tt>example.TXT</tt>" or "<tt>HELLO.txt</tt>" but not "<tt>Mixed.txt</tt>". Few other operating systems support this. This creates a backwards-compatibility problem with older Windows versions (95, 98, ME) that see all-uppercase filenames if this extension has been used, and therefore can change the name of a file when it is transported, such as on a USB flash drive. Current 2.6.x versions of Linux will recognize this extension when reading (source: kernel 2.6.18 /fs/fat/dir.c and fs/vfat/namei.c); the mount option ''shortname'' determines whether this feature is used when writing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://linux.die.net/man/8/mount |title=mount(8): mount file system – Linux man page}}</ref>

====Third-party extensions====
Before Microsoft added support for long filenames and creation/access time stamps, bytes 0x0C&ndash;0x15 of the directory entry were used by alternative operating systems to store additional metadata. These included:

== FAT licensing ==
Microsoft applied for, and was granted, a series of patents for key parts of the FAT file system in the mid-1990s. Being almost universally compatible and well-understood, FAT is frequently chosen as an interchange format for [[flash media]] used in digital cameras and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]]. 

On [[2003-12-03]] Microsoft announced it would be offering licenses for use of its FAT specification and "associated intellectual property", at the cost of a US$0.25 royalty per unit sold, with a $250,000 maximum royalty per license agreement.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/intellectualproperty/search/details.mspx?ip_id=IDAEYWHD&keywords=fat | publisher=Microsoft |title=Intellectual Property Licensing – FAT File System}}</ref>

To this end, Microsoft cited four patents on the FAT file system as the basis of its intellectual property claims. All four pertain to long-filename extensions to FAT first seen in [[Windows 95]]:
* {{US patent|5745902}} - Method and system for accessing a file using file names having different file name formats. Filed [[July 6]], [[1992]]. This covered a means of generating and associating a short, 8.3 filename with long one (for example, "Microsoft.txt" with "MICROS~1.TXT") and a means of enumerating conflicting short filenames (for example, "MICROS~2.TXT" and "MICROS~3.TXT"). It is unclear whether this patent would cover an implementation of FAT without explicit long filename capabilities. [[Hard link]]s in [[Unix]] file systems do not appear to be [[prior art]]: deleting a FAT file via its long name will also remove its short name. Renaming a file to a "short" name also updates the long file name for coherency; similarly, renaming a file to a "long" name will allocate a new "short" name. In NTFS, hard links and dual names are separate concepts and each hard link has two names. Finally, at the API level, both names are always provided together when a directory lookup is requested from the system; they do not appear as two separate files and do not have to be "matched" to determine unique files.
* {{US patent|5579517}} - Common name space for long and short filenames. Filed for on [[1995-04-24]]. This covers the method of chaining together multiple consecutive [[8.3 filename|8.3 named]] directory entries to hold long filenames, with some of the entries specially marked to prevent their confusing older, long filename-unaware FAT implementations.
** The [[Public Patent Foundation]] successfully challenged this patent; the claims were rejected<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pubpat.org/Microsoft_517_Rejected.htm | title=At PUBPAT's request, patent office rejects Microsoft's FAT patent: Government Relies Heavily on Evidence Submitted by PUBPAT | publisher=Public Patent Foundation | date=2004-09-30 | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref> on [[2004-09-14]], due to prior disclosure<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.com.com/Microsoft+FAT+patent+falls+flat/2100-1014_3-5390138.html | title=Microsoft FAT patent falls flat | date=2004-09-30 | author=Ina Fried | publisher=CNET News | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref> of the claimed techniques in patents {{US patent|5307494}} and {{US patent|5367671}}. This decision was later overturned by the Patent Office on [[2006-01-10]].
* {{US patent|5758352}} - Common name space for long and short filenames. Filed on [[1996-09-05]]. This is very similar to 5,579,517.
** The [[USPTO|Public Patent Foundation]] successfully challenged this patent (USPTO); The USPTO rejected this patent on [[2005-10-05]], on the grounds that "the six assignees <!-- [sic] --> names were incorrect".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2005/10/05/microsoft_patent/ | title=Microsoft FAT patent rejected - again | author=Andrew Orlowski | publisher=The Register | date=2005-10-05 | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.out-law.com/default.aspx?page=6202 | title=Patent Office rejects two Microsoft FAT patents | publisher=out-law.com | date=2005-06-10 | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref> This decision was also later overturned by the Patent Office on [[2006-01-10]].
* {{US patent|6286013}} - Method and system for providing a common name space for long and short file names in an operating system. Filed on [[1997-01-28]]. This makes claims on the methods used when [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]] and Windows Me expose long filenames to their [[MS-DOS]] compatibility layer. It does not appear to affect any non-Microsoft FAT implementations.

Many technical commentators have concluded that these patents only cover FAT implementations that include support for long filenames, and that removable solid state media and consumer devices only using short names would be unaffected.

Additionally, in the document "Microsoft Extensible Firmware Initiative FAT 32 File System Specification, FAT: General Overview of On-Disk Format" published by Microsoft (version 1.03, [[2000-12-06]]), Microsoft specifically grants a number of rights, which many readers have interpreted as permitting operating system vendors to implement FAT.

Microsoft is not the only company to have applied for patents for parts of the FAT file system.  Other patents affecting FAT include:
* {{US patent|5367671}} -  System for accessing extended object attribute (EA) data through file name or EA handle linkages in path tables.  Filed on [[1990-09-25]] by Barry A. Feigenbaum and Felix Miro of IBM, this makes claims on the methods used by [[OS/2]], [[Windows NT]], and [[Linux]] for storing extended attribute data in the "EA&nbsp;DATA.&nbsp;SF" file.

=== Appeal ===
As there was widespread call for these patents to be re-examined, the Public Patent Foundation (PUBPAT) submitted evidence to the [[USPTO|US Patent and Trade Office]] (USPTO) disputing the validity of these patents, including prior art references from [[Xerox]] and [[IBM]]. The USPTO acknowledged that the evidence raised "substantial new question[s] of patentability," and opened an investigation into the validity of Microsoft's FAT patents.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/14/ms_fat_patent_reexamined/ | title=Microsoft's war on GPL dealt patent setback | author=Andrew Orlowski | publisher=The Register | date=2004-06-14 | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref>

On [[2004-09-30]] the USPTO rejected all claims of {{US patent|5579517}}, based primarily on evidence provided by PUBPAT. Dan Ravicher, the foundation's executive director, said, "The Patent Office has simply confirmed what we already knew for some time now, Microsoft's FAT patent is bogus."

According to the PUBPAT press release, "Microsoft still has the opportunity to respond to the Patent Office's rejection. Typically, third party requests for reexamination, like the one filed by PUBPAT, are successful in having the subject patent either narrowed or completely revoked roughly 70% of the time."

On [[2005-10-05]] the Patent Office announced that, following the re-examination process, it had again rejected all claims of patent 5,579,517, and it additionally found {{US patent|5758352}} invalid on the grounds that the patent had incorrect assignees.

Finally, on [[2006-01-10]] the Patent Office ruled that features of Microsoft's implementation of the FAT system were "novel and non-obvious", reversing both earlier non-final decisions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.com.com/Microsofts+file+system+patent+upheld/2100-1012_3-6025447.html | title=Microsoft's file system patent upheld | date=2006-01-10 | author=Anne Broache | publisher=CNET News | accessdate=2006-10-14}}</ref>
