'''Cerebral hypoxia''' (the [[pathological]] condition is called  '''hypoxic encephalopathy''') is a hypoxic condition in which there is a decrease of [[oxygen]] supply to the [[brain]] or parts of the brain despite adequate blood flow (compare with [[cerebral ischemia]]). [[Drowning]], [[strangling]], [[choking]], [[suffocation]], [[cardiac arrest]], [[head trauma]], [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], and complications of [[general anesthesia]] can create conditions that can lead to cerebral hypoxia. Symptoms of mild cerebral hypoxia include [[inattentiveness]], poor judgment, [[memory loss]], and a decrease in [[motor coordination]]. [[Brain cells]] are extremely sensitive to [[oxygen deprivation]] and [[cerebral infarction]] can begin within five minutes after oxygen supply has been cut off. When hypoxia lasts for longer periods of time, it can cause [[seizures]], [[unconsciousness]], [[brain damage]], and [[death]].

== Treatment ==
Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the hypoxia, but basic [[life-support]] systems have to be put in place: mechanical ventilation to secure the [[airway]]; fluids, blood products, or medications to support [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]]; and medications to suppress [[seizures]].

== Prognosis ==
Recovery depends on how long the [[brain]] has been deprived of oxygen and how much [[brain damage]] has occurred, although [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] can cause brain damage days to weeks after the event. Most people who make a full recovery have only been briefly [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]]. The longer someone is unconscious, the higher the chances of death or brain death and the lower the chances of a meaningful recovery. During recovery, [[psychological]] and [[neurological]] abnormalities such as [[amnesia]], [[personality regression]], [[hallucination]]s, [[memory loss]] and [[muscle spasm]]s and twitches may appear, persist, and then resolve.
