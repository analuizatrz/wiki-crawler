The '''housefly''' (also '''house fly''' or '''house-fly'''), '''''Musca domestica''''', is the most common [[fly]] occurring in homes, the most familiar of all flies and indeed one of the most widely distributed animals; it is a [[pest (animal)|pest]] that can carry and transmit serious diseases.

== Physical description ==
[[Image:Housefly anatomy-key.svg|thumb|Anatomy of a housefly]]
The adults are 5-8&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] long. Their [[thorax]] is gray, with four dark longitudinal lines on the back, the underside of their abdomen is yellow, and their whole body is covered with hair. The females are slightly larger than the males and have a much larger space between their red [[compound eye]]s.

Like most [[fly|Diptera]] (meaning "two-winged"), houseflies have only one pair of [[insect wing|wings]]; the hind pair is reduced to small [[halteres]] that aid in [[flight]] stability. Characteristically, the media vein (M1+2 or fourth long [[Insect_wing#Veins|vein]] of the wing) shows a sharp upward bend.

Species that appear similar to the housefly include:
* The [[lesser house fly]], ''Fannia canicularis'', is somewhat smaller, more slender, and the media vein is straight
* The [[stable fly]], ''Stomoxys calcitrans'', has piercing [[mouthpart]]s and the media vein is only slightly curved
These houseflies are subjects of study by scientists all over the world.

== Life cycle ==

Each female fly can lay over 9,000 [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. The eggs are white and are about 1.2&nbsp;mm in length. Within a day, the larvae ([[maggot]]s) hatch from the eggs; they live and feed in (usually dead and decaying) organic material, such as garbage or [[faeces]]. They are pale whitish, 3-9&nbsp;mm long, thinner at the mouth end, and have no legs. At the end of their third [[instar]], the maggots crawl to a dry cool place and transform into [[pupa]]e, colored reddish or brown and about 8&nbsp;mm long. The adult flies then emerge from the pupae. (This whole cycle is known as [[metamorphosis (biology)|complete metamorphosis]].) The adults live from half a month to a month in the wild, or longer in benign laboratory conditions. After having emerged from the pupae, the flies cease to grow; small flies are not young flies but the result of insufficient food during the larval stage.

Some 36 hours after having emerged from the pupa, the female is receptive for mating. The male mounts her from behind to inject [[sperm]]. Normally the female mates only once, storing the sperm to use it repeatedly for several sets of eggs. Males are territorial: they will defend a certain territory against other males and will attempt to mount any females that enter that territory.

The flies depend on warm temperatures; generally, the warmer the temperature the faster the flies will develop. In the [[winter]], most of them survive in the larval or pupa stage in some protected warm location.

Some species of [[wasp]]s can [[parasite|parasitise]] and kill the pupae.

Houseflies can take in only liquid foods. They spit out [[saliva]] on solid foods to pre-digest it, and then suck it back in. They also vomit partially digested matter and eat it again.

The flies can walk on vertical planes, and can even hang upside down from ceilings. This is accomplished with the [[surface tension]] of liquids secreted by [[gland]]s near their feet.

Flies continually preen themselves, cleaning their eyes with their forelegs and dusting off their legs by rubbing them together. They do this because most of their taste and smell receptors are on the hairs of their legs. 

Flies have a very highly-evolved evasion reaction which helps to ensure their survival. It is possible to confuse a fly's evasion system by swatting it with two objects simultaneously from different directions. The holes in a [[fly swatter]] minimise the air current which warns the fly of being hit, whilst reducing air resistance and increasing speed of the swat. This evasion reaction can also be used against the fly. Clapping your hands several inches above the fly will cause it to try to escape, usually into your just closing hands.

Houseflies release a [[pheromone]] called [http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/muscalure.html muscalure] that serves both [[Swarm|aggregation]] and [[sexual attraction]] purposes.

The housefly is an object of biological research, mainly because of one remarkable quality: the [[Sex-determination system|sex determination]] mechanism. Although a wide variety of sex determination mechanisms exists in nature (e.g. male and female [[heterogamy]], [[haplodiploidy]], environmental factors) the way sex is determined is usually fixed within one [[species]]. However, the housefly exhibits many different mechanisms for sex determination, such as male heterogamy (like most [[insect]]s and [[mammal]]s), female heterogamy (like [[bird]]s) and maternal control over offspring sex. This makes the housefly one of the most suitable species to study the [[evolution]] of sex determination.

== Evolution ==
Even though the order of flies ([[Diptera]]) is much older, true houseflies evolved in the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] era, some 65 million years ago.
They are thought to have originated in the southern [[Palearctic]] region, particularly the Middle East. Because of their close, [[commensal]] relationship with man, they probably owe their worldwide dispersal to co-migration with humans.

== Flies and humans ==
In colder climates, houseflies occur only with humans. 
They have a tendency to aggregate and are difficult to dispel. They are capable of carrying over 100 [[pathogen]]s, such as [[typhoid]], [[cholera]], [[Salmonella]], [[bacillary dysentery]], [[tuberculosis]], [[anthrax]], [[ophthalmia]],  and [[parasitic worm]]s. The flies in poorer and lower-[[hygiene]] areas usually carry more pathogens. Some strains have become immune to most common [[insecticide]]s.
