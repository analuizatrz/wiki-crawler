'''''SpongeBob SquarePants''''' is an American animated [[Television program|television series]] and [[media franchise]]. It is currently one of [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon's]] and [[Nicktoons]] most watched shows. In 2007, it was named by [[TIME magazine|TIME]] as one of the [[greatness|greatest]] [[television show]]s of all [[time]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1651341_1659196_1652730,00.html|title=www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1651341_1659196_1652730,00.html |title=SpongeBob SquarePants |accessdate=2008-04-24 |date= |format= |work=TIME magazine }}</ref> Although its original network is [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], ''SpongeBob'' is now broadcast across the world. It was created by [[artist]], [[animator]], and former [[marine biologist]], [[Stephen Hillenburg]], and is produced through his production company, United Plankton Pictures, Inc.

The [[series]] is set in the [[Pacific Ocean]], in the [[fictional]] city of [[Bikini Bottom]] and on the surrounding [[lagoon]] [[floor]]. The [[pilot episode]] first aired in the United States on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] after the ''[[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]]'' on May 1, 1999. The "official" series [[premiere]] followed on July 17, 1999 with the second episode, "[[Bubblestand]]/[[Ripped Pants]]."

The series star is a character who is a [[sea]] [[sponge]], but in shape and color his body more closely resembles a kitchen sponge.

==Premise==
[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] is [[a]] [[sea sponge]] who lives in a [[pineapple]] under the [[sea]], while his [[octopus]] neighbor, Squidward Tentacles, lives in a [[moai]]. SpongeBob's other neighbor and best friend is a pink [[starfish]] named [[Patrick Star]], who lives under a [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. [[SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick]] live on either side of [[Squidward Tentacles]], much to Squidward's [[despair]]. Squidward is constantly annoyed by SpongeBob and Patrick's antics.   

SpongeBob's house-pet is a [[snail]] named [[Gary the Snail|Gary]], whose "meow" is that of a cat. Although Gary only [[speak]]s in a few [[episodes]], the [[characters]] have shown an ability to understand him. In addition to this, underwater worms bark exactly like dogs, and are kept on [[chains]]. [[Jellyfish]] are the equivalent of bees; buzzing, stinging with poison (although it appears as an electric shock), and producing delicious "jelly", mocking the name "[[jellyfish]]", while still referring to a bee's honey. Fish act as the citizens of the community but, as a rule, are not important characters.  

Although the denizens of Bikini Bottom live under water, they mostly do not float, and gravity usually applies.  A flurry of bubbles accompanies actions in many of the episodes to remind the viewer that the setting is underwater.  However, the laws of physics in Bikini Bottom change somewhat from time to time, but mostly the water acts like air.  For instance, characters can pour a glass of liquid, just as we do above the sea.  Bikini Bottom has functional baths, pools, and toilets, and there are lakes and streams. In [[Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom|Battle for Bikini Bottom]] and a regular beach setting, Goo Lagoon, underwater liquid is referred to as goo.  Once, during an episode set in a wilderness area, Patrick questions how a camp fire is possible on the lagoon bottom.  As soon as the question is asked, the fire is immediately extinguished with a sizzle.  

SpongeBob, who is absorbent, yellow, and porous (according to the title song), works as a fry cook at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[Fast food|fast-food restaurant]], with Squidward as the cashier. The Krusty Krab is owned by Eugene H. Krabs ([[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Mr Krabs|Mr. Krabs]]).
Sheldon J. Plankton (commonly referred to as "[[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Plankton|Plankton]]") is Mr. Krabs's arch enemy who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the [[Chum Bucket]] across the street from the Krusty Krab. The Chum Bucket has almost never had a customer, and Plankton spends most of his time plotting to steal the recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular [[Krabby Patty]] burgers. Only in the movie does he succeed; the formula is never actually revealed to the audience. This fact is mocked in the Krusty Krab Training Video episode, where the episode cuts off before the video reveals the recipe. Plankton's computer wife, Karen, alternately helps him in his schemes or bickers with him.

Sandy Cheeks is another friend of SpongeBob. She is a squirrel that lives in an underwater dome in Bikini Bottom. She was sent there by her bosses, chimpanzees, according to the episode, "[[Chimps Ahoy]]". Sandy is from [[Texas]], and speaks with a Texan accent.  Sandy is an expert at [[karate]].  Sometimes she gets a little home-sick and sings a little song. When not inside her tree-dome, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe in water. Sandy, just like a normal squirrel, hibernates once a year, as seen in a few episodes such as "[[Pre-Hibernation Week]]" and "[[Survival of the Idiots]]".  

Instead of [[Automobile|cars]], the residents of Bikini Bottom drive [[boats]]. SpongeBob is still in boating school after failing the driving test over seventy-two times.  Ironically, when there is a separate body of water underwater, such as a swimming pool or lagoon, a non-car boat must be used to cross it because both SpongeBob and Patrick cannot swim, they must be taught by [[List of major SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Larry the Lobster|Larry the Lobster]]. In the episode "Snowball Effect" (Episode 46 [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 3)|Season 3]]) it snows in Bikini Bottom. 

===Setting===
[[Image:BikiniBottomTNL.JPG|thumb|right|175px|Bikini Bottom]]
SpongeBob and his friends live in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Bikini Bottom is like a regular city with a downtown, suburbs, coastal areas, its own airport, bus system, and fair park. Stephen Hillenburg said once that Bikini Bottom was loosely based on Seattle, Washington.{{fact}} An example of this statement is in the episode "Pre-Hibernation Week". Sandy and SpongeBob were fighting on a tall structure called the Sea Needle, referring to the Space Needle, a tall structure in Seattle. Hillenburg has said that he wants to leave the location of Bikini Bottom to the imagination, claiming that the Baywatch scene from the movie was just a reference to his favorite show of all time.

'''Bikini Bottom''' is a city that is the main setting of the series, located at the bottom of the [[Pacific Ocean]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nick.com/shows/spongebob_squarepants/index.jhtml | title=SpongeBob SquarePants Official Website | publisher=[[Nickelodeon]] | accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref>  It is where the series' main characters live and where most of the episodes take place. Bikini Bottom is similar to an average U.S. city.  The city consists of various businesses, including restaurants, stores, and manufacturers. The city has a stable economy, balanced education and health systems, a structured government, and a firm law enforcement system. There are even stadiums, amusement parks, and other recreational facilities. 

Bikini Bottom's geography is shown as consisting of mountains, dense forests, lakes, lagoons, caves, grasslands, reefs, rivers, and barren desert wastelands. 

The city is divided into various areas, including Downtown Bikini Bottom, Goo Lagoon, Sand Mountain, Jellyfish Fields, Kelp Forest, the Flying Dutchman's Graveyard, Residents' Row (SpongeBob's/Patrick's/Squidward's homes),<ref>''as seen in [[SpongeBob SquarePants: Revenge of the Flying Dutchman]]''</ref> Ancient Mariner Valley (the location of Neptune's Paradise.)<ref>as mentioned in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants: Employee of the Month]]'' computer game</ref> and Palm Bay.

The city is divided by its main road, Conch Street, which runs from downtown and past the homes of SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick, through the [[The Krusty Krab|Krusty Krab restaurant]], the Chum Bucket and the Reef Theatre cinema. The road intersects with Barnacle Road and Coral Avenue. Anchor Way is not far off from Conch Street. Conch Street runs north-south as revealed in the ''SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom'' video game. Downtown Bikini Bottom is located in the northernmost point of the city, while SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick's House are on the southern part of the road. Goo Lagoon is located west of the road, while Jellyfish Fields is to the east. Other establishments are located more southerly, including Sandy's house, Shady Shoals retirement home, the Krusty Krab, the Chum Bucket, and the Movie Theater. The Kelp Forest is located more southerly. 

In the center of Bikini Bottom, the citizens work and live in large, gray buildings made of metal. There are some other forms of buildings, mostly aquatic-themed as seen above. Further out from the town citizens need to use whatever is available and easy to live in, such as Patrick's rock, SpongeBob hollowed-out pineapple, and the Easter Island Head Squidward lives in.

====Inhabitants====
The population of Bikini Bottom is uncertain. The creator of the show, [[Stephen Hillenburg]], confirmed that Bikini Bottom is a large city. Before almost leaving the city, [[Sandy Cheeks]] sang a song describing it as "crowded and smoggy,"<ref name="Chimps Ahoy">as seen in the episode, "Chimps Ahoy"</ref> in The Pretty Patties burger stand, SpongeBob asked for the 46,853rd customer and everyone in the city was surrounding the stand which means the city has at least 46,853 people, but as seen in the episode "[[Nautical Novice]]," Mrs. Puff said "millions of innocent lives", perhaps suggesting a population of over a million.

Bikini Bottom's populace, like that of the rest of the series, consists of various anthropomorphic fish, whales, crabs, sponges, squid, starfish, anchovies, lobsters, sharks, and most other forms of sea life, including sea monsters. Some forms of sea life, like jellyfish, seahorses, snails, and worms aren't anthropomorphic, and are treated like pets or wild animals. For example, snails resemble cats, and worms resemble dogs (an example of this is SpongeBob's pet snail [[Gary the Snail|Gary]], who meows, and one-time pet worm Rex, who barks). The first known land creature to live in Bikini Bottom was the Dark Knight, an ancestor of Sandy Cheeks, before the 12th century (Bikini Bottom was then known as Bikini Bottomshire).<ref name="Dunces and Dragons">as seen in "Dunces and Dragons"</ref> Sandy, a squirrel from [[Texas]], is (along with Wormy the caterpillar other pets, and a small cricket that was featured in a recent episode) the only land creature seen living in modern Bikini Bottom. Land creatures (other than Sandy) like humans, bugs and birds are like Godzilla to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom. Inhabitants of Bikini Bottom are called "Bikini Bottomites".

====History====
The history of Bikini Bottom can be traced back to the [[Permian]] period (which looked more like the [[Tertiary]] period in the [[prehistoric]] Bikini Bottom.) During a [[time-travel]] incident, [[Squidward Tentacles]] accidentally made his way to this era, and inadvertently invented the sport of jellyfishing.<ref name="SB-129">as seen in the episode, "[[SB-129]]"</ref> Years later, in a more advanced prehistoric time (possibly the [[Cretaceous]] era, since a [[pterodactyl]] was seen flying at the opening scene and giant reptilian whale like creatures (possibly Zeuglodons); however, the prehistoric Bikini Bottom looked more like the late [[Quarternary]] era), SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog (possible ancestors of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, respectively) discovered [[fire]].<ref>as seen in "[[SpongeBob BC]]"</ref>
[[Image:BikiniBottomshire.JPG|200px|thumb|A scene from "[[Dunces and Dragons]]" (2006) that depicts Bikini Bottom in the [[Middle Ages]], as a village known as Bikini Bottomshire]] <!-- FAIR USE of BikiniBottomshire.JPG: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BikiniBottomshire.JPG for rationale --> 
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:BikiniBottomshire2.JPG|200px|thumb|A later scene from "[[Dunces and Dragons]]" (2006) that depicts an overview of Bikini Bottomshire from the bottom of Planktonomor's tower.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 22 December 2007}}]] -->

In the [[Medieval]] Era, Bikini Bottomshire was under the rule of King Krabs (ancestor of [[Eugene H. Krabs]]) and was under attack by the evil [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]], Planktonomor (ancestor of [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Plankton|Sheldon J. Plankton]]). SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star were transported to this time after a [[joust]]ing accident. They were expected to arrive in this era because of a prophecy. According to Princess Pearl, the prophecy was that they (SpongeBob and Patrick) were the ones to save the [[kingdom]]. Princess Pearl (daughter of King Krabs) was kidnapped by Planktonomor's fire-breathing jellyfish, and taken hostage at Planktonomore's tower. Fulfilling the prophecy, SpongeBob and Patrick saved Princess Pearl and defeated Planktonomor. Later, during a [[parade]] celebrating SpongeBob and Patrick's heroic deeds, King Krabs invented the Krabby Patty, which would be passed down through the Krabs family, the formula being kept secret.<ref name="Dunces and Dragons" /> 

Even later, somewhere around the 18th century in [[Old West]], one of Plankton's ancestor, Dead-Eye Plankton, takes over Bikini Gulch and renames it Dead-Eye Gulch. A big western-style show down happens between Dead-Eye Plankton, and SpongeBob's Ancestor, SpongeBuck SquarePants.

On November 30, 1942, Eugene H. Krabs was born, along with the birth-friend, Sheldon J. Plankton.<ref>as seen in "[[Sleepy Time]]", and "[[Friend or Foe]]"</ref> In his childhood, he immediately became a [[finance|financial]] [[genius]] as he is known today. In 1947, his father gave him a [[dollar]], which he loved dearly. However, he spent it on a [[soda]], which was upsetting to him. Soon, he went to Poseidon Elementary. The two opened up a restaurant and, after accidentally knocking Old Man Jenkins out with their tainted patty, they had an argument and became bitter rivals. Not long after, a war occurred, in which the events are unknown. After the war, Mr. Krabs fell into a deep depression, which seemed endless; however, a bankrupt retirement home, gave him hope. Mr. Krabs decided to buy the building and rename it, marking the establishment of the Krusty Krab. The financial success of the Krusty Krab took off and became a premier eating facility in Bikini Bottom.

In the present time, Bikini Bottom has had various occurrences of destruction. In "[[Dying for Pie]]", a bomb pie fell on Squidward's face, causing a [[nuclear]] explosion (with Squidward dead center).  In "[[Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm]]", an Alaskan Bull Worm struck Bikini Bottom, which made Sandy hunt it down. Bikini Bottom was moved away, but the worm crushed it. In "[[Wormy]]", while Sandy was out of town, SpongeBob and Patrick were given the duty of taking care of her pets, one of which was a caterpillar named Wormy. Wormy grew into a [[butterfly]] overnight, which caused SpongeBob and Patrick to freak out, thinking Wormy is dead. They then proceeded to cause a mass hysteria that lead to the city's destruction. [[Global warming]] also took effect in the short, "[[The Endless Summer]]." Then another atomic explosion happened when SpongeBob set his nuclear cleaning gun to maximum power in "The Krusty Plate".

Years later, Mr. Krabs opened a second restaurant, named the "Krusty Krab 2." Plankton initiated his evil Plan Z, and stole King Neptune's [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], thereby framing Mr. Krabs. He was frozen because of this; however, SpongeBob and Patrick set out toward Shell City to retrieve Neptune's crown, and then saved the day. These events are depicted in the Spongebob Squarepants film.<ref>"SpongeBob Movie"</ref>

In the future, the jellyfish will migrate every year to a spot in Jellyfish Fields, as seen in "SpongeHenge," SpongeBob built five porus stone decoys that make the same sound he does when it is windy, but apparently the people of Bikini Bottom would soon forget who made them, and claim that they "do not know who built these or for what reason". This is potentially a rather intriguing reference, as these statues have a similar background to the infamous Easter Island statues (which appear in the show themselves, in the form of Squidward's house).  Even further in the future, around the year [[5th millennium|4017]], everything will be made of [[chrome]], and whatever isn't gets sprayed with chrome paint. Also, [[time travel]] will have been invented, and SpongeTron, distant relative of SpongeBob, will have 486 clones. Three of the clones have names SpongeTrons X, Y, and Z.

====Entertainment====
In Bikini Bottom entertainment contributes to the social interaction within the city. The Krusty Krab houses shows such as ''The Annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show'' (featuring the unpopular Squidward Live segment), ''The Komedy Krab'', Who Dougie And SpongeBob Guested and ''Live Nude Pranksters'', which featured an unclothed SpongeBob and Patrick. The city has a popular cinema, ''The Reef'', but it is destroyed in the episode "[[Something Smells]]" by SpongeBob and Patrick's extremely bad breath. In addition, a popular band called ''Ned and the Needlefish'' started in Bikini Bottom. Bikini Bottom also has many forms of media, such as news, magazines, radio, and television contribute to Bikini Bottom's wide spread of news and entertainment. The city paper is called the ''Bikini Times''. It features the regular news, as well as daily comics.There is another newspaper that is called the ''Bikini Bottom Inquirer'', which is a parody of ''[[The National Inquirer]]''. There also appear to be boy bands and rock bands; the first being ''Boys Who Cry'' (a parody of [[The Cure]]'s single "[[Boys Don't Cry (song)|Boys Don't Cry]]") that Pearl enjoys, ''Stingray 5000'' (possibly a parody of ''[[Powerman 5000]]'') who had released a record entitled "You Rock My Clams" which Patrick happily found in the dumpster as seen in the episode "[[Missing Identity]]" and ''Ned and the Needlefish'', who appear in "[[Wigstruck]]".

== Characters ==
{{main|List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters}}
*[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] — A very friendly and optimistic [[Sea Sponge]] that loves krabby patties, jellyfishing, karate, and blowing bubbles. He works at the [[Krusty Krab]] as the lone fry cook.
*[[Patrick Star]] — SpongeBob's best friend; a dimwitted, pink [[starfish]].
*[[Squidward Tentacles]] — SpongeBob and Patrick's next door neighbor and SpongeBob's co-worker at the [[Krusty Krab]], where he is the cashier. He hates both his neighbors, and is not afraid to show it. 
*[[Sandy Cheeks]] — A clever [[squirrel]] and scientist from [[Texas]]. Sandy is able to live underwater in Bikini Bottom by wearing an air helmet and space suit. She is another best friend of SpongeBob.
*[[Eugene H. Krabs]] — A [[crab]] who runs the [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant where SpongeBob works. He absolutely adores money, displaying miserly characteristics as well as being selfish and greedy, even to his daughter.
*[[Pearl Krabs]] — Mr. Krabs's teenage daughter. She is a whale who acts like a stereotypical American teenage girl. Also she seems to be spoiled as her father both pampers and deprives her throughout the series.
*[[Gary the Snail]] — SpongeBob's pet, his only sound is a [[Miaow|"meow"]] like that of a cat. In fact, snails in Bikini Bottom are analogous to cats, just as worms are to dogs and jellyfish are to insects.
*[[Sheldon J. Plankton]] - A small and evil plankton who runs the Chum Bucket, a (possible) competitor to the [[Krusty Krab]] even though it receives no customers. He is also Mr. Krabs arch rival, intent on getting the secret Krabby Patty formula to put the Krusty Krab out of business. Many episodes revolve around his plots to do this. But, the episode "friend or foe" makes it hard to tell if Plankton and Mr. Krabs are friends or foe. 
*[[Mrs. Puff]] — A [[pufferfish]] that is SpongeBob's boating teacher. Mrs. Puff dislikes SpongeBob and is eager to get him out of her class. She usually gets in to jail after SpongeBob's foolish acts. A widow, her husband was captured and turned into a pufferfish lamp.

*[[Karen (SpongeBob SquarePants Character)|Karen]] - Plankton's computer wife. She often aides her husband in devising plans to steal the secret formula. 
*[[Patchy the Pirate]] is a non-animated pirate played by Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob. He hosts all of the 30-minute SpongeBob specials, such as ''House Party'' and ''The Lost Episode''.

== Popularity ==
''SpongeBob SquarePants'' is the only cartoon to consistently make the Top 10 list in the [[Nielsen ratings]], and is the first "low budget" [[Nicktoon|Nickelodeon cartoon]], according to the network, to become extremely popular. Low-budget cartoons had not garnered as much esteem as higher-rated (and higher-budgeted) shows, such as ''[[Rugrats]]'', although when ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' aired in 1999, it had gained a significant enough number of viewers in the ratings to be considered popular, eventually becoming more popular than ''Rugrats'' had ever been. SpongeBob follows other Nickelodeon shows that have attracted "older" followers: ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', the ''[[Kablam!]]'' skits, ''[[Action League Now!]]'' and ''[[The Angry Beavers]]''. Other shows have followed in this trend as well: ''[[Invader Zim]]'' and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' won a similar fan base when they aired in 2001, and the latter is now second only to SpongeBob in popularity, while the former was cancelled despite gaining a cult following. The show debuted in 1999, and during that time, ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and ''[[Pokémon]]'' were still the biggest crazes. SpongeBob did not gain its popularity until around 2000, and it has remained popular since then. It has achieved the "Great" rating on tv.com, with a 8.7 rating, the third best rating in Nickelodeon, the first being ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' with a rating of 9.3 and the second being ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' with a rating of 8.8. 

=== Broad appeal ===
SpongeBob is one in a long line of cartoons that is designed to appeal to adults as well as children. This has a lot to do with the absurd way underwater life and situations are represented, and with the situations, references, and words used, which younger viewers might not understand. Certain innuendos also are intended to go over younger viewers' heads.<ref>{{cite book

Numerous [[marine biology]] in-jokes are woven into the show. There are also many water jokes made. The most common one is the one in which you set a fire under the sea. There are also often complex ironic scenarios that need close attention. 

Part of the show's appeal has to do with the childlike nature of SpongeBob and his best friend, Patrick Star, both of whom are adults but display an innocence typical of human children. However, the characters are not immune from more adult avocations, including rock musicianship in a stadium performance, reminiscent of a hard rock concert, or Patrick turning to SpongeBob after they had nurtured a baby scallop, holding his arms out saying "Let's have another".

Unlike the Nickelodeon network, SpongeBob features well-known independent musicians who contribute to its soundtrack. [[Alternative rock]] bands such as [[Wilco]], [[The Shins]], [[The Flaming Lips]] and [[Ween]] (who have contributed two original songs to the show and their 1997 song "Ocean Man" to the movie soundtrack), as well as metal bands [[Pantera]], [[Motörhead]] and [[Twisted Sister]] have made appearances on the show and movies soundtracks, and [[heavy metal]] group [[Metallica]] even released a T-shirt featuring cartoon versions of themselves playing live with the characters SpongeBob and Patrick. [[United Kingdom|British]] rock singer [[David Bowie]] was a special guest on the SpongeBob SquarePants episode Atlantis SquarePantis, which aired on November 12, 2007.<ref name=bowie>{{cite web | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/11152007/tv/bowie_sponge_makes_splash_402981.htm | title = Bowie "sponge" makes splash| publisher = New York Post | date = November 15, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-12-07 }}</ref> The episode drew total 8.8 million viewers, the biggest audience in the show's eight-year history.<ref name=bowie/>

The TV movie Atlantis SquarePantis referenced numerous other movies or stories. David Bowie's character Lord Royal Highness (with his upper class accent) and the locals looked remarkably like the [[Blue Meanies (Yellow Submarine)]] - quite fitting for an underwater adventure. When the characters arrived at his habitat, he fell down as he proceeded down the red carpet (as [[Willy Wonka]] did in [[Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]), before leading them on a tour. A case can also be made for the yellow road used in the tour and a reference to ''[[The Wizard of Oz]]'' - along with the movie being a musical.

When SpongeBob feeds a worm to a scallop in ''Rock-a-Bye Bivalve'', the worm references [[Nikita Krushchev]] by saying, "We will bury you!"

The show became so popular with adolescents and adults that the series was broadcast on [[MTV]] and featured on [[Spike TV]]. A quote by Patrick ("It's gonna rock!" from the episode [[Mid-Life Crustacean]]) has been used as a promotional tag-line for rock stations. Ren and Stimpy, among others, had followed a similar path. ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'', released on November 19, 2004, features a [[cameo appearance]] by actor [[David Hasselhoff]], in a parody of his role from the ''Baywatch'' TV series.

=== Merchandising and marketing ===
{{main|List of SpongeBob SquarePants merchandise}}

Merchandise based on the show ranges from [[Kraft Dinner|Kraft Macaroni & Cheese]], [[Go-Gurt]], [[Kellogg's]] cereal, and video games to [[boxer shorts]], flip-flops, pajamas, t-shirts, slippers and [[radios]]. 

The show also spawned a large and popular merchandise line at [[Hot Topic]], [[Claire's]], [[Waldenbooks]], [[Borders Books]], [[Barnes & Noble]], [[Best Buy]], [[RadioShack]], [[Target Stores|Target]], [[KB Toys]], [[Big Lots]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Shopko]], [[Meijer]], [[Kmart]], [[Sears]], [[JCPenney]], [[Kohl's]], [[Lowe's]], [[T.J. Maxx]], [[Toys "R" Us]] and [[Ames Department Stores Inc.|Ames]] stores in the United States as well as the [[Zellers]], [[Wal-Mart Canada]] and Toys "R" Us stores in Canada, and a limited selection of merchandise in Australia at [[Kmart Australia]] and [[Target Australia]]. 

There have been kids meal tie-ins at [[Wendy's Restaurant|Wendy's]] for "SpongeBob's House Party Special" in 2002 and at [[Burger King]] restaurants in 2001, 2003, and for the movie in 2004. In 2006, another kids meal tie-in for Burger King was introduced for the "Lost in Time" special, and in 2007 for the "Friend or Foe" special featuring [[BK Chicken Fries]] designed to look like SpongeBob. In November 2007, a Burger King Kids Meal was released to tie-in with the new episode "Atlantis SquarePantis". The most recent tie-in kids meal for Burger King features "Pest of the West" toys.

A [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]] tie-in with SpongeBob-themed Happy Meal boxes and toys has not been released in North America yet, but was released in Europe in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and also in Australia in early 2007 at about the same time a ''[[Catscratch]]'' Happy Meal was released in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SkWflm3UdQ|title=www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SkWflm3UdQ<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref> In Australia, the advertisement for the McDonald's SpongeBob Happy Meal won the Pester Power Award for the fact that the ads are enticing young children to want its food because of the free toy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diet-blog.com/archives/2007/10/05/mcdonalds_fresh_salads.php |title=McDonald's Fresh Salads |accessdate=2008-04-24 |date=2007-10-05 |format= |work=dietblog }}</ref>

In Japan, they had a kids meal tie-in with [[KFC]] which featured different toys based on the TV series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viacom.com/view_release.jhtml;jsessionid=OQP0BQE5ORHWSCQBAFLQ4CY?inID=10000007&inReleaseID=227116 |title=SpongeBob SquarePants KFC toys in Japan |accessdate= |date= |format= |work= }}</ref>{{Dead link|date=May 2008}}

SpongeBob was also featured on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the 90s: Part Deux]]: [[I Love 1999: Part Deux]]'' as part of a commentary by [[Michael Ian Black]] and [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] among other celebrities. 

As a tie-in beverage for the ''SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'', [[7-Eleven]] convenience stores created a pineapple-flavored [[Slurpee]] in 2004, which was discontinued in 2005.

Events in the past with the SpongeBob SquarePants theme include an exhibit at [[Underwater Adventures Aquarium]] in the [[Mall of America]] called SeaCrits of Bikini Bottom during the summer of 2003. In October 2004, a [[NASCAR]] [[Busch Series]] race was named The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 300, presented by [[Lowe's]] and broadcast on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] featuring [[Jimmie Johnson]]'s #48 Lowe's stock car and [[Kyle Busch]]'s #5 stock car painted for the race with the SpongeBob Movie paint schemes. There were contests tied in with the movie where fans could win SpongeBob-related items or a trip to the [[Cayman Islands]]. 
[[Image:Db 2008 SpongeBob61.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge]] [[roller coaster]] inside [[Nickelodeon Universe]] [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]], United States.]]
The motion simulator/interactive movie ride "Escape from Dino-Island 3D" at [[Six Flags Over Texas]] was turned into "[[SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D]]", with water squirts, real bubbles, and other sensory enhancements. The SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D ride opened at the Noah's Ark Dive-In Theater located at [[Noah's Ark Waterpark]] in [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]] in the summer of 2007. [[LEGO]] received license to produce SpongeBob SquarePants building sets, which are available in stores now. SpongeBob appears at the Mall of America's new Nickelodeon theme park re-branded from the Mall of America's [[Park at MOA]] (formerly Camp Snoopy) to [[Nickelodeon Universe]] in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] suburb of [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. The new theme park features a SpongeBob-themed [[Gerstlauer]] Euro-Fighter custom [[roller coaster]], the [[SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge]], which has replaced the Mystery Mine Ride and Olde Time Photo store on the west end of the theme park next to the [[Dora the Explorer]] ferris wheel and across from the [[Pepsi Orange Streak]]. The theme park opened March 15, 2008. The SpongeBob Rock Bottom plunge features a statue of SpongeBob and Patrick riding a bus down a 90° angle holding a giant rubber glove.

In 2007, some new high-end SpongeBob-themed [[electronics]] have been introduced by [[Imation]] Electronics Products under the Npower brand, such as [[MP3 players]], [[digital cameras]], a [[DVD player]], and a [[flatscreen]] [[television]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://npower2.memorexelectronics.com/html/product_family.php?FID=8&SID=2&opento=2 |title=SpongeBob SquarePants |accessdate=2008-04-24 |date= |format= |work=Npower Electrionics }}</ref>

Other items featuring SpongeBob include a special edition [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] [[board game]], [[The Game of Life|Life]] and [[Operation (board game)|Operation]] board game as well as a SpongeBob SquarePants edition of [[Ants in the Pants]] and [[Yahtzee]]. [[SEGA]] Corporation introduced a ticket [[redemption game]] based on the show that has become popular with most [[video arcades]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.segaarcade.com/pr/SpongeBob.asp|title=www.segaarcade.com/pr/SpongeBob.asp |title=SpongeBob SquarePants |accessdate=2007-01-22 |date= |format= |work=Sega Arcade}}</ref>{{Dead link|url=http://www.segaarcade.com/pr/SpongeBob.asp|date=May 2008|date=June 2008}} 

Pictures of SpongeBob SquarePants also started to appear on the labels of 8 oz. cans of [[Green Giant]] cut [[green beans]] and frozen packages of Green Giant green beans and butter sauce which featured free stickers in 2007 as part of an initiative to get kids to eat their vegetables.  <ref>[http://promomagazine.com/entertainmentmarketing/news/nickelodeon_healthy_food_initiative_green_giant_053107/ Nickelodeon Expands Healthy Food Initiative with Green Giant<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The SpongeBob SquarePants market saturation has become something of a joke. In the comic strip "Sherman's Lagoon", Hawthorne the crab is showing off a small Junior nuclear reactor, and Herman the shark says "Boy, that SpongeBob will endorse anything!"

When the complete first season of SpongeBob SquarePants was released in the United Kingdom, it included some heavy editing (though not to the cartoons themselves). The audio commentaries were cut out, and only two extras were left in, possibly to avoid a 12 rating. A similar approach was taken with the second season; it included no audio commentaries and only one extra, "Around the World with SpongeBob SquarePants".

==History==
===Development (1993 – 1999)===
''SpongeBob's'' history can be traced back to 1993 when ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' first aired. One of the producers was Stephen Hillenburg, a cartoon worker/marine biologist who loved both his careers. When ''Rocko's Modern Life'' was canceled in 1996, Hillenburg began working on ''SpongeBob'' (although sketches trace back to 1987). He teamed up with creative director [[Derek Drymon]], who had worked on shows such as ''[[Doug]]'', ''[[Action League Now!]]'', and ''[[Hey Arnold!]]''. Drymon had worked with Hillenburg on ''Rocko's Modern Life'' as well, as did many SpongeBob crew members, including writer-directors Sherm Cohen and [[Dan Povenmire]], writer [[Tim Hill]], [[voice actor]]s Tom Kenny and Doug Lawrence (aka "Mr. Lawrence"), actor-writer [[Martin Olson]] and animation director Alan Smart. Another crew member with previous Nickelodeon cartoon experience was former ''[[Angry Beavers]]'' story editor [[Merriwether Williams]], who worked on that show for its first few seasons and switched to ''SpongeBob'' in July 1999.

During production of the show, Bobson provided a concept of short comics with the same style of the show, but the characters looked different. ''SpongeBob'' used to be named ''SpongeBoy'',<ref>"SpongeBob Exposed! The Insiders Guide to SpongeBob SquarePants" book</ref> and used to wear a red hat with a green base and a white business shirt with a tie. The name "SpongeBoy" did not make it into the show since the name was already officially trademarked by [[Bob Burden]], creator of ''[[Flaming Carrot]]''. Hillenburg later chose the alternative name "SpongeBob". The original name was once referenced in the show by Mr. Krabs' line, "SpongeBoy, me Bob!." The Krusty Krab was originally spelled with the letter C rather than K, but Stephen Hillenburg thought Ks were funnier and it would fit his [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] heritage.

===Rise In Popularity (1999 - 2000)===
''SpongeBob'' aired its first episode, "Help Wanted/Reef Blower/Tea at the Treedome", after the 1999 ''Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards''. At this time, ''Rugrats'' was the most popular show on Nickelodeon and had already outlived dozens of other lower-budget cartoons. SpongeBob, with its generally lower-class animation and humor style more rooted in clever word-play and culture-references unlike the [[toilet humor|potty humor]] that made ''Rugrats'' so popular, was expected to be just another one of those shows. Following early struggles, its ratings soared, and a year after release, it surpassed ''Rugrats'' as Nickelodeon's highest rated show. ''SpongeBob''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s signature voice (provided by [[Tom Kenny]]) and humorous style was enjoyable to both younger and older audiences.

===Peak years (2000 – 2003)===
The show began its second season in 2000 with more high-quality animation and even more popular episodes. By then it was clear to the world that SpongeBob had opened the door to many other cartoons to use more "adult" senses of humor and come from smaller companies. In 2001, The Fairly OddParents aired from the then-small Frederator company. It focused on a sense of humor similar to SpongeBob’s, only more realistic, slightly crazier (and more suggestive to "adult" topics), and with more pop culture references; this show managed to become a hit as well and currently ranks behind SpongeBob as Nick's second most popular show. That same year, Invader Zim aired, created by comic book writer Jhonen Vasquez; it had a dark but silly sense of humor (similar to Vasquez's other comic books) that managed to attract a very loyal cult following consisting more of teens and adults than young children (Though also containing a moderate amount of preteens). SpongeBob, however, was the leader of all these shows and had by this time started its now famous merchandise line.

The first part of 2002 saw SpongeBob at its peak. The beginning of the third season produced many of classic episodes and focused on the same style and animation concepts as the second season.

Unfortunately, things changed late in the year. Due to rumors of a movie, there was high speculation that the show would be canceled and that 2002 would feature the last season of new episodes. Fans were devastated and online petitions were widely distributed to convince Nickelodeon to produce more episodes by showing continuing fan support. "SpongeBob Meets The Strangler/Pranks A Lot" was the last episode of this season, and aired in October 2004. It was also released on DVD at the end of 2003. Following this, the movie was released in November 2004.

===Hiatus and movie era (2003 – 2005)===
A hiatus from 2003 to 2005 challenged viewer loyalty. This was before the program's lowest ratings with "Survival of the Idiots" on March 5, 2001 aired, causing speculation that the show might even be cancelled after the movie's release.

''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'' earned over $85,000,000 in revenue in the United States, considered to be under-expectations. It was announced late in 2004 that SpongeBob would be continuing with a new season due in 2005. Hillenburg, despite the rumors, did not actually leave the show but has resigned from his position as the show's executive producer (this job now belongs to Derek Drymon, with [[Paul Tibbitt]] taking over Drymon's job as creative director).

===Comeback (2005 – Present)===
TV advertisements for ''SpongeBob'''s fourth season first aired publicly during the 2005 ''Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards''. The new episodes began airing on May 6, 2005. One noticeable difference between the earlier seasons and the new episodes is the voice of Spongebob himself. Although [[Tom Kenny]] still voices the character, from the Spongebob Squarepants Movie forward, the voice of the main character is slightly different. The first new episode of Season 4 was "[[Fear of a Krabby Patty]]"/"[[Shell of a Man]]". After airing three new episodes on Fridays from May 6 – May 20, Nickelodeon showed no new episodes until September 2005.

For the first time in the series' run, Nickelodeon began airing 11-minute segments of new episodes separately, spread over two weeks. This practice began with the airing of the episode "[[Selling Out (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Selling Out]]" on September 23; its companion episode, "[[Funny Pants]]," premiered the following week.

The Star Online eCentral reported in December 2005 that Nickelodeon had ordered 20 more episodes, bringing the show’s total to 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2005/12/27/tvnradio/12578379&sec=tvnradio |title=More SpongeBob on Nickelodeon |accessdate=2008-04-24 |date=2005-12-27 |format= |work=Star Online eCentral }}</ref>

In December 2006, ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' was approved for a sixth season, which consisted of thirteen episodes, unlike the usual twenty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-mightybamypoehlerSpongeBob’sixthseason,0,6061089.story?coll=zap-news-headlines |title=Nick Buzzes With 'B,' Squeezes More 'SpongeBob' |accessdate=2008-04-24 |date=2006-12-13 |format= |work=zap2it.com }}</ref>

Nickelodeon aired the special "[[Have You Seen This Snail?]]" in November 2005. However, it was not until February 2006 that new episodes resumed, starting with "[[Dunces and Dragons]]" and continuing until June 2, 2006. Further new episodes appeared during September 2006 ("[[New Leaf]]" and "[[Once Bitten]]"), and November ("[[The Best Day Ever]]" and "[[Wigstruck]]") — drawing 6.7 million viewers — the Best Day Ever was a 25-hour 100-episode SpongeBob TV event ending with the SpongeBob SquarePants Movie although the Nickelodeon narrator made a goof about the marathon being 24 hours instead of the actual 25 hours. Fans voted for Karate Island as the most popular SpongeBob episode.

The new episodes in 2007 started airing on January 15, showing three new episodes back to back on February 19, 2007, officially beginning the airing of the fifth season which featured more potty humor than previously shown. On July 23, 2007 Nickelodeon aired a special event, called the "SpongeBob New-New-New-New-New Week" in which from Monday to Friday, a new episode of season five (except for Squid Wood, from season four) would air. This continued until the end of the second week.

On November 12, 2007 SpongeBob's first TV movie, "[[Atlantis SquarePantis]]" premiered, after a SpongeBob marathon. A behind the scenes feature aired after the movie. Also, on November 23, 2007, there was another SpongeBob marathon including a rerun of Atlantis SquarePantis and four new episodes as part of a Nickelodeon Thanksgiving event. The event also named the "Sweet Victory" scene in "Band Geeks" as the greatest moment in Nicktoons history. Season Six officially premiered with five new 11-minute episodes airing in a marathon from March 3 to March 7, 2008. There is still an episode from the fifth production season which has yet to air.

On March 13, 2008, it was announced that ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' will have an additional thirty-nine episodes, which includes the remaining episodes of season six, and a season seven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/news/Pages/newstext.aspx?RID=1118469|accessdate= 2008-03-15|work=Viacom.com|title=Nickelodeon Picks-Up Returning Animated Hits|date=2008-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=1656|accessdate= 2008-03-16|work=Animation Insider|title=Nickelodeon Upfront 2008|date=2008-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=22274|accessdate= 2008-03-19|work=ToonZone|title=Nick Orders New Eps of "SpongeBob," "OddParents" and Other Series|date=2008-03-13}}</ref>

In April 2008, another SpongeBob special, "Pest of the West," aired after a marathon of SpongeBob episodes, chosen by voters in the previous weeks. Burger King had a special line of Kids Meal toys for the event, and it was released to DVD shortly thereafter.

From June 2 to June 6, 2008, Nickelodeon aired a SpongeBob SquarePants marathon entitled SpongeBob Premiere Factor 5 (SPF5), in which a new 11 minute segment would be shown each day.

Another premiere week aired from August 4 to August 8, Nick aired a 5 new Spongebob marathon entitle Bikini Bottom Confidential, which a new 11 minute segment would be shown each day.

==Music==
*The ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' [[theme music|theme song]] is primarily based on the [[sea shanty]], "[[Blow the Man Down]]". It is sung by Painty the Pirate, voiced by [[Patrick Pinney]], and can be found on the soundtrack ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants: Original Theme Highlights]]''. This song is popularly misattributed to "Weird Al" Yankovic. A cover of the song by [[Avril Lavigne]] can be found on [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (soundtrack)]]. Another cover by the [[Violent Femmes]], which aired as a commercial on Nickelodeon to promote Season 2, can be viewed in the special features of the [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants Media|Nautical Nonsense/Sponge Buddies DVD]]. A choral version was recorded for the SpongeBob [[Christmas special]] where the last repetition of "SpongeBob SquarePants" was replaced by, "It's the SpongeBob Christmas special." The theme song is occasionally utilized as marching cadence. An instrumental version of the opening theme is used in Italy. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72IDfAN7V3E YouTube - Spongebob intro<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*Traditional sea shanties are used for the musical themes in the show. Most commonly used is that of "[[Drunken Sailor]]". In the episode "Krusty Krab Training Video," a young Eugene Krabs is shown walking to a soda vending machine, la-laing the shanty "Blow the Man Down." Various songs used in SpongeBob SquarePants come from the [[Associated Production Music]] library, some of which have also been used in shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'',''[[Ren & Stimpy]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'', ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', and ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]''. For competition-based episodes, some of [[Sam Spence]]'s [[NFL Films]] music is used (such as "A Golden Boy Again" used in episodes such as [[The Fry Cook Games]] and "Ramblin' Man from Gramblin" is used in Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V. "The Lineman" is also used extensively in Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy episodes.) Ironically, one of Spence's more famous songs for the NFL Films library of music is an orchestral version of "Drunken Sailor" called "Up She Rises", first suggested by [[Steven Sabol]] to his father [[Ed Sabol|Ed]] because he liked the song at summer camp.
*Also used to great comedic and dramatic effect in the show, is Hawaiian steel guitar music. Various compositions featuring the Hawaiian steel convey happy, sad, or goofy emotions and situations. Many are traditional Hawaiian melodies such as "Aloha 'Oe" and are performed by classic steel guitar artists.
*A number of songs are written and recorded by surf instrumental guitar-based rock bands, including The Woodies and [[The Langhorns]].   [[The MelTones]]' songs "Kung Fu Saturdays," "Polynesian Adventure" and "Rocket Sled To Oahu" were used in the series.   The Surfdusters' songs "Henpecker", "Dementia" and "Kona Angel" were also used in the series.
*In the episode "Prehibernation Week," the music is played by the heavy metal band Pantera. Whenever SpongeBob does something dangerous, the music starts playing. The opening credits have a shot that reads "Special musical guests Pantera".
*The guitarist [[Newton Faulkner]] sometimes plays SpongeBob SquarePants in his set and has even invented a [[Jungle]] version: JungleBob.
*The episode "SpongeBob B.C." features background music including a track best known to [[United Kingdom|British]] viewers as the theme to 1970s TV [[sitcom]] ''[[Terry and June]]''. The music was written by [[John Carter (musician)|John Shakespeare]], a former member of 1960s pop group [[The Ivy League (band)|The Ivy League]].

==Magazine==
In the United Kingdom, a SpongeBob SquarePants [[magazine]] is currently being published by [[Titan Magazines]] every four weeks. It was first published on February 3, 2005.
