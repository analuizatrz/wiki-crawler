A '''robot''' is a [[machine|mechanical]] or [[virtual]] [[artificial]] agent. In practice, it is usually an [[Electromechanics|electro-mechanical system]] which, by its appearance or movements, conveys a sense that it has [[Intention|intent]] or [[Wiktionary:agency|agency]] of its own. The word ''robot'' can refer to both physical robots and [[virtual]] [[software agent]]s, but the latter are usually referred to as [[Internet bot|bots]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_bot.html|title=Telecom glossary "bot"|publisher=Alliance for Telecommunications Solutions|date=2001-02-28|accessdate=2007-09-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070202121608/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_bot.html|archivedate=2008-07-14}}</ref> There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots, but there is general agreement among experts and the public that robots tend to do some or all of the following: move around, operate a mechanical arm, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behavior, especially behavior which mimics humans or animals.

Stories of artificial helpers and companions and attempts to create them have a long history, but fully [[autonomous]] machines only appeared in the 20th century.  The first [[digital]]ly operated and programmable robot, the 
[[Unimate]], was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them.  Today, commercial and [[industrial robot]]s are in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans.  They are also employed for jobs which are too dirty, dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans.  Robots are widely used in [[manufacturing]], assembly and packing, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/robotics/universal/index.html |title=Robotics: About the Exhibition |publisher=The Tech Museum of Innovation |accessdate=2008-09-15 }}</ref>

People have a generally positive perception of the robots they actually encounter.  [[Domestic robot]]s for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes.  There is anxiety, however, over the economic impact of automation and the threat of robotic weaponry, anxiety which is not helped by the many villainous, intelligent, acrobatic robots in popular entertainment.  Compared with their fictional counterparts, real robots are still benign, dim-witted and clumsy.

==Defining characteristics==
{{double image|right|Knight2000 ex107.jpg|180|Asimo look new design.jpg|180|[[KITT]] is mentally anthropomorphic, while ASIMO is physically anthropomorphic}}

While there is no single correct definition of "robot",<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/technology-blog/2007/07/your_view_how_would_you_define.html|title=Your View: How would you define a robot?| publisher=CBC News|date=2007-07-16|  accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> a typical robot will have several or possibly all of the following properties.
*It is artificially created.
*It [[Sensor|can sense]] its [[Wiktionary:environment|environment]], and [[Wiktionary:manipulation|manipulate]] or [[interaction|interact]] with things in it.
*It has some ability to make choices based on the environment, often using [[Control theory|automatic control]] or a preprogrammed sequence.
*It is [[Computer program|programmable]].
*It moves with one or more axes of [[Axis of rotation|rotation]] or [[Translation (geometry)|translation]].
*It makes [[Dexterity|dexterous]] coordinated [[Motion (physics)|movements]].
*It moves without direct human intervention.
*It appears to have intent or agency.

The last property, the appearance of agency, is important when people are considering whether to call a machine a robot, or just a machine. (See [[anthropomorphism]] for examples of ascribing intent to inanimate objects.)

'''Mental agency'''<br />
For robotic engineers, the physical appearance of a machine is less important than the way its actions are [[Control system|controlled]]. The more the control system seems to have [[agency]] of its own, the more likely the machine is to be called a robot. An important feature of agency is the ability to make choices.

* A [[clockwork]] car is never considered a robot.
* A remotely operated vehicle is sometimes considered a robot (or [[telerobotics|telerobot]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ranier.hq.nasa.gov/telerobotics_page/realrobots.html|title=Real Robots on the Web|publisher=NASA Space Telerobotics Program|date=1999-10-15|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> 
* A car with an onboard computer, like [[Bigtrak]], which could drive in a programmable sequence, might be called a robot.
* A [[Smart car|self-controlled car]] which could sense its environment and make driving decisions based on this information, such as the 1990s [[driverless car]]s of [[Ernst Dickmanns]] or the entries in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]], would quite likely be called a robot.
* A [[Sentience|sentient]] car, like the fictional [[KITT]], which can make decisions, navigate freely and converse fluently with a human, is usually considered a robot.

'''Physical agency'''<br />
However, for many [[layman|laymen]], if a machine appears to be able to control its arms or limbs, and especially if it appears [[Wiktionary:anthropomorphic|anthropomorphic]] or [[Wiktionary:zoomorphic|zoomorphic]] (e.g. [[ASIMO]] or [[Aibo]]),  it would be called a robot.
* A [[player piano]] is rarely characterized as a robot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyastone.co.uk/nrl/gp_robot.html|title=The Grand Piano Series: The History of The Robot|publisher=Nimbus Records|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>
* A [[CNC]] milling machine is very occasionally characterized as a robot.
* A [[Factory robot|factory automation arm]] is almost always characterized as an industrial robot. 
* An autonomous wheeled or tracked device, such as a self-guided rover or self-guided vehicle, is almost always characterized as a mobile robot or service robot.
* A [[zoomorphic]] mechanical toy, like [[Roboraptor]], is usually characterized as a robot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2005/07/29/roboraptor-review-this-one-has-teeth/|title=Roboraptor review - this one has teeth (in the discussion below, several people talk about RoboRaptor as being a real robot.|author=Marc Perton|date=2005-07-29|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=2008-08-07}}</ref>
* A mechanical humanoid, like [[ASIMO]], is almost always characterized as a robot, usually as a service robot.

Even for a 3-axis CNC milling machine using the same control system as a robot arm, it is the arm which is almost always called a robot, while the CNC machine is usually just a machine.  Having eyes can also make a difference in whether a machine is called a robot, since humans instinctively connect eyes with sentience.  However, simply being anthropomorphic is not a sufficient criterion for something to be called a robot.  A robot must do something; an inanimate object shaped like ASIMO would not be considered a robot.

=== Definitions ===
[[Image:Laproscopic Surgery Robot.jpg|thumb|A [[laparoscopic]] robotic [[surgery]] machine]] 

It is difficult to compare numbers of robots in different countries, since there are different definitions of what a "robot" is. The [[International Organisation for Standardisation]] gives a definition of robot in [[ISO 8373]]: "an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose, manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dira.dk/pdf/robotdef.pdf |title=Definition of a robot|format=[[PDF]]|publisher=Dansk Robot Forening|accessdate=2007-09-10|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070628064010/http://www.dira.dk/pdf/robotdef.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-15}}</ref> This definition is used by the [[International Federation of Robotics]], the [[European Robotics Research Network]] (EURON), and many national standards committees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euron.org/resources/standards.html |title=Robotics-related Standards Sites |publisher=European Robotics Research Network |accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>

The Robotics Institute of America (RIA) uses a broader definition: a robot is a "re-programmable multi-functional manipulator designed to move materials, parts, tools, or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JDOfVxRC8x8C&pg=PA513&lpg=PA513&source=web&ots=_iMgIErG60&sig=uo7dgICtMBdETyNieUmktCBSnHI|title=Axiomatic Design and Fabrication of Composite Structures|first=Dai Gil|last=Lee|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195178777|date=2005|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref>  The RIA subdivides robots into four classes: devices that manipulate objects with manual control, automated devices that manipulate objects with predetermined cycles, programmable and servo-controlled robots with continuous point-to-point trajectories, and robots of this last type which also acquire information from the environment and move intelligently in response.

There is no one definition of robot which satisfies everyone, and many people have their own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtuar.com/click/2005/robonexus/index.htm|first=Igor|last=Polk|title=RoboNexus 2005 robot exhibition virtual tour|publisher=Robonexus Exhibition 2005|date=2005-11-16|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>  For example, [[Joseph Engelberger]], a pioneer in industrial robotics, once remarked: "I can't define a robot, but I know one when I see one."<ref>{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Harris|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/robot.htm|title=How Robots Work|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>  According to [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], a robot is "any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/505818/robot|title=Robot (technology)|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>  [[Merriam-Webster]] describes a robot as a "machine that looks like a human being and performs various complex acts (as walking or talking) of a human being", or a "device that automatically performs complicated often repetitive tasks", or a "mechanism guided by automatic controls".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/robot|title=Robot |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{seealso|Robots in literature}}
[[Image:Capek play.jpg|thumb|left|A scene from [[Karel Čapek]]'s 1920 play [[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]], showing three robots]]
The word ''robot'' was introduced to the public by [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] writer [[Karel Čapek]] in his play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'', which premiered in 1921.<ref name="KapekWebsite"/> The play begins in a [[factory]] that makes artificial people called ''robots'', but they are closer to the modern ideas of [[androids]] and [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]s, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. They can plainly think for themselves, though they seem happy to serve. At issue is whether the ''robots'' are being [[Exploitation|exploited]] and the consequences of their treatment.

However, Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word; he wrote a short letter in reference to an [[etymology]] in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in which he named his brother, the painter and writer [[Josef Capek|Josef Čapek]], as its actual originator.<ref name="KapekWebsite">{{cite web|url=http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html|first=Dominik|last=Zunt|title=Who did actually invent the word "robot" and what does it mean?|publisher=The Karel Čapek website|accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref>
In an article in the Czech journal ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' in 1933, he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures ''laboři'' (from [[Latin]] ''labor'', work). However, he did not like the word, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested "roboti".  The word ''robota'' means literally work, labor or [[serfdom|serf labor]], and figuratively "drudgery" or "hard work" in [[Czech language|Czech]] and many Slavic languages.<ref>Including [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], Russian and Polish.  The origin of the word is the [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''rabota'' "servitude" ("work" in contemporary [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and Russian), which in turn comes from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root [http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE363.html ''*orbh-''].</ref>  Serfdom was outlawed in 1848 in [[Bohemia]], so at the time Čapek wrote ''R.U.R.'', usage of the term ''robota'' had broadened to include various types of work, but the obsolete sense of "serfdom" would still have been known.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.karelcapek.net/rur.htm |title=Čapek's R.U.R. |publisher=Karelcapek.net |accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref><ref>''Robot'' is [[cognate]] with the German word ''Arbeiter'' (worker).  In Hungary, the ''robot'' was a [[feudal]] service, similar to [[corvee]] which was rendered to local [[magnate]]s by [[peasant]]s every year. {{cite web|url=http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/history/1848/reaction.html|title=The Dynasties recover power|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of robots}} 
Many ancient mythologies include artificial people, such as the mechanical servants built by the Greek god [[Hephaestus]]<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h5tKJvApybsC&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=hephaestus+handmaidens&source=web&ots=AmE4CYagER&sig=qoE-R-FGa3CRe9fKPjBKCdk24C4|title=Ancient Greek Ideas on Speech, Language, and Civilization|author=Deborah Levine Gera|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0199256167}}</ref> ([[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] to the Romans), the clay [[golem]]s of Jewish legend and clay giants of Norse legend, and [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]], the mythical statue of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] that came to life.

In the 4th century BC, the Greek mathematician [[Archytas]] of Tarentum postulated a mechanical steam-operated bird he called "The Pigeon".  [[Hero of Alexandria]] {{nowrap|(10–70 AD)}} created numerous user-configurable automated devices, and described machines powered by air pressure, steam and water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Heron.html | author=O'Connor, J.J. and E.F.

[[Image:Al-jazari robots.jpg|right|thumb|[[Al-Jazari|Al-Jazari's]] programmable humanoid robots]]
[[Al-Jazari]] (1136&ndash;1206), a [[Muslim inventions|Muslim inventor]] during the [[Artuqid dynasty]], designed and constructed a number of automated machines, including kitchen appliances, musical automata powered by [[water]], and the first [[Computer programming|programmable]] [[humanoid robot]]s in 1206.  The robots appeared as four musicians on a boat in a lake, entertaining guests at royal drinking parties. His [[mechanism]] had a programmable drum machine with pegs ([[cam]]s) that bumped into little [[lever]]s that operated [[percussion instrument]]s.  The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations.

===Early modern developments===
[[Image:KarakuriBritishMuseum.jpg|thumb|left|Tea-serving [[karakuri]], with mechanism, 19th century. [[Tokyo National Science Museum]].]] 
[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452&ndash;1519) sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495.  Da Vinci's notebooks, rediscovered in the 1950s, contain detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as [[Leonardo's robot]], able to sit up, wave its arms and move its head and jaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardo3.net/leonardo/books%20I%20robot%20di%20Leonardo%20-%20Taddei%20Mario%20-%20english%20Leonardo%20robots%201.html|title=Leonardo da Vinci's Robots|publisher=Leonardo3.net|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> The design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his ''[[Vitruvian Man]]''. It is not known whether he attempted to build it.

In 1738 and 1739, [[Jacques de Vaucanson]] exhibited several life-sized automatons: a flute player, a pipe player and a duck.  The mechanical duck could flap its wings, crane its neck, and swallow food from the exhibitor's hand, and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment.<ref>Wood, Gabby. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/feb/16/extract.gabywood "Living Dolls: A Magical History Of The Quest For Mechanical Life"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[2002-02-16]]. </ref>  Complex mechanical toys and animals built in Japan in the 1700s were described in the ''Karakuri zui'' (''Illustrated Machinery'', 1796).

===Modern developments===
The Japanese craftsman [[Hisashige Tanaka]] (1799–1881), known as "Japan's Edison", created an array of extremely complex mechanical toys, some of which served tea, fired arrows drawn from a quiver, and even painted a Japanese ''kanji'' character.<ref>{{Cite book | author=N.

[[Image:Unimate sm.jpg|thumb|190px|right|''The first Unimate'']] 
In 1926, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] created Televox, the first robot put to useful work.  They followed Televox with a number of other simple robots, including one called Rastus, made in the crude image of a black man.  In the 1930s, they created a humanoid robot known as [[Elektro]] for exhibition purposes, including the 1939 and 1940 [[World's Fair]]s. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freetimes.com/stories/13/35/robot-dreams-the-strange-tale-of-a-mans-quest-to-rebuild-his-mechanical-childhood-friend |publisher=The Cleveland Free Times |title=Robot Dreams : The Strange Tale Of A Man's Quest To Rebuild His Mechanical Childhood Friend |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Robots of Westinghouse: 1924-Today |author=Scott Schaut |publisher=Mansfield Memorial Museum |date=2006}}</ref>  In 1928, Japan's first robot, [[Gakutensoku]], was designed and constructed by biologist [[Makoto Nishimura]]. 

The first electronic [[autonomous robot]]s were created by [[William Grey Walter]] of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. They were named ''Elmer'' and ''Elsie''. These robots could sense light and contact with external objects, and use these stimuli to navigate. <ref name="gwonline">{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.uwe.ac.uk/Robots/gwonline/gwonline.html |title=The Grey Walter Online Archive |accessdate=2008-09-25 |auther=Owen Holland}}</ref> 

The first truly modern robot, digitally operated and programmable, was invented by [[George Devol]] in 1954 and was ultimately called the [[Unimate]]. Devol sold the first Unimate to [[General Motors]] in 1960, and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] to lift hot pieces of [[metal]] from a [[die casting]] machine and stack them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robothalloffame.org/unimate.html|title=Robot Hall of Fame - Unimate|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

{{Main|Industrial robot|Domestic robot}}
There were more than one million robots in operation worldwide in the first half of 2008, with roughly half in Asia, 32% in Europe, 16% in North America, 1% in [[Australasia]] and 1% in Africa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robots.com/blog.php?tag=48 |title=Robots Today and Tomorrow: IFR Presents the 2007 World Robotics Statistics Survey |publisher=World Robotics |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref>  Industrial and service robots can be placed into roughly two classifications based on the type of job they do. The first category includes tasks which a robot can do with greater productivity, accuracy, or endurance than humans; the second category consists of dirty, dangerous or dull jobs which humans find undesirable. 

===Increased productivity, accuracy, and endurance===
Many factory jobs are now performed by robots.  This has led to cheaper mass-produced goods, including automobiles and electronics.  Stationary manipulators used in factories have become the largest market for robots.
[[Image:Industrial Robotics in car production.jpg|thumb|German [[KUKA]] [[Industrial robot]]s doing vehicle underbody assembly]]

'''Some examples of factory robots:'''
* '''[[Automaker|Car production]]:''' Over the last three decades automobile factories have become dominated by robots. A typical factory contains hundreds of [[industrial robot]]s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.  On an automated production line, a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is [[welding|welded]], [[adhesive|glue]]d, [[paint]]ed and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations.
* '''[[Packaging]]:''' [[Industrial robot]]s are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods, for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes, or for loading and unloading machining centers.
* '''[[Electronics]]:''' Mass-produced [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) are almost exclusively manufactured by pick-and-place robots, typically with [[SCARA]] manipulators, which remove tiny [[electronic component]]s from strips or trays, and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactsystems.com/c5_series.html |publisher=Contact Systems |title=Contact Systems Pick and Place robots|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref> Such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour, far out-performing a human in speed, accuracy, and reliability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assembleon.com/surface-mount-assembly/pick-and-place-equipment/a-series/|publisher=Assembleon| title=SMT pick-and-place equipment|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref>
* '''[[Automated guided vehicle]]s (AGVs):''' Mobile robots, following markers or wires in the floor, or using vision<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcaddy.net|title=Smart Caddy|publisher=Seegrid|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> or lasers, are used to transport goods around large facilities, such as warehouses, container ports, or hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agvsystems.com/basics/vehicle.htm|title=The Basics of Automated Guided Vehicles|publisher=Savant Automation, AGV Systems|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> Early AGV-style robots were limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time. Very little feedback or intelligence was required, and the robots needed only the most basic [[Wiktionary:exteroceptors|exteroceptors]] (sensors).  However, newer AGVs such as the Speci-Minder,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsrobotics.com/products/speciminder.html |title=SpeciMinder|publisher=CSS Robotics |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> ADAM, <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rmtrobotics.com/tire_agv.html |title=ADAM robot |publisher=RMT Robotics |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> Tug<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aethon.com/can_do_tug.html |title=Can Do |publisher=Aethon |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> and PatrolBot Gofer<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobilerobots.com/AGV.html |title=Delivery Robots & AGVs |publisher=Mobile Robots |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> navigate by recognizing natural features. [[3D scanner]]s or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative [[observational error|errors]] in [[dead reckoning|dead-reckoning]] calculations of the AGV's current position.  Some AGVs can create maps of their environment and use those maps to navigate in real time by [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM). They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non-repetitive and non-sequential tasks such as transporting [[photomask]]s in a semiconductor lab, specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses.

===Dirty, dangerous, dull or inaccessible tasks===

There are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots.  The job may be boring, such as domestic [[cleaning]], or dangerous, such as exploring inside a [[volcano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ri.cmu.edu/projects/project_163.html|title=Dante II, list of published papers|publisher=The Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref>  Other jobs are physically inaccessible, such as exploring another [[planet]],<ref>

* '''[[Domestic robots]]:''' As prices fall and robots become smarter and more autonomous, robots are increasingly being seen in the home where they are taking on simple but unwanted jobs, such as [[vacuum cleaner|floor cleaning]] and [[lawn mower|lawn mowing]]. 

* '''[[Telerobotics|Telerobot]]s:''' When a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible, teleoperated robots, or telerobots are used. Rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements, a telerobot is controlled from a distance by a human operator. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a [[laparoscopic]] surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time.<ref name="daVinci"/> Several authors have been using a device called the Longpen to sign books remotely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/story/2007/08/15/longpen-trial.html |title=Celebrities set to reach for Atwood's LongPen |publisher=cbc.ca |accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref>

===Robot Research===
Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new types of robots, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them.
* '''Soft Robots:''' Robots with [[silicone]] bodies and flexible actuators ([[Pneumatic artificial muscles|air muscles]], [[electroactive polymers]], and [[ferrofluid]]s), controlled using [[fuzzy logic]] and [[neural networks]], look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons, and are capable of different behaviors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/science/27robo.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ei=5070&en=91395fe7439a5b72&ex=1177128000 |title=In the Lab: Robots That Slink and Squirm |author=John Schwartz |publisher=nytimes.com |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref> 

[[Image:SwarmRobot org.jpg|thumb|160px|left|A [[swarm]] of robots from the Open-source Micro-robotic Project]]
* '''[[Swarm robotics|Swarm robots]]:''' Inspired by [[Colony (biology)|colonies of insects]] such as [[ants]] and [[bees]], researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the [[emergent behavior]] of the swarm is more complex. The whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a [[superorganism]], exhibiting [[swarm intelligence]]. The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm, and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swarmrobot.org|title=Open-source micro-robotic project|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=149|publisher=iRobot Corporation|title=Swarm|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure can be extremely costly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2000/12/40750 |publisher=Wired Magazine |title=Look, Up in the Sky: Robofly |first=Louise|last=Knapp |date=2000-12-21|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref>
* '''Haptic interface robots:''' Robotics also has application in the design of [[virtual reality]] interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use in the [[haptic]] research community. These robots, called "haptic interfaces" allow touch-enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments. Robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of "virtual" objects, which users can experience through their sense of [[somatosensory system|touch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17363&ch=biotech&sc=&pg=1 |publisher=MIT Technology review |title=The Cutting Edge of Haptics |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref>
* '''Generation Robots:''' ''First, second and third generation'' robots are terms used by Professor [[Hans Moravec]], Principal Research Scientist at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] [[Robotics Institute]] in describing the near future evolution of robot technology.<ref>[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] conversation with Professor [[Hans Moravec]], October, 1997.  ''[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/robots/moravec.html NOVA Online]''</ref>  ''First generation'' robots, researcher [[Hans Moravec|Hans]] predicted in 1997, should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a [[lizard]] and should become available by 2010.  Because the ''first generation'' robot would be incapable of [[learning]], however, professor [[Hans Moravec|Hans]] predicts that the ''second generation'' robot would be an improvement over the ''first'' and become available by 2020, with an intelligence maybe comparable to that of a [[mouse]].  The ''third generation'' robot should have an intelligence comparable to that of a [[monkey]].  Though ''fourth generation'' robots, robots with [[human]] intelligence, professor [[Hans Moravec|Hans]] predicts, would become possible, he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050.

==Potential problems==

Fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films. A common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots, motivated to take over or destroy the human race.  (See ''[[The Terminator]], [[Runaway (1984 film)|Runaway]], [[Bladerunner]], [[Robocop]]'', [[Replicator (Stargate)|the Replicators in ''Stargate'']], [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|the Cylons in ''BattleStar Galactica'']], ''[[The Matrix]]'', and ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]''.)  Some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy; others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware.  Another common theme is the reaction, sometimes called the "[[uncanny valley]]", of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely.<ref name="uncanny">{{cite journal|url=http://www.macdorman.com/kfm/writings/pubs/Ho2007EmotionUncanny.pdf |first=C.

March 11-14. Amsterdam.}}</ref> ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), often called the first science fiction novel, has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or monster advancing beyond its creator.  

[[Manuel De Landa]] has noted that "smart missiles" and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots, and they make some of their decisions autonomously.  He believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines.<ref>*[[Manuel de Landa]], ''[[War in the Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', New York: Zone Books, 1991, 280 pages, Hardcover, ISBN 0-942299-76-0; Paperback, ISBN 0-942299-75-2.</ref>

Marauding robots may have entertainment value, but unsafe use of robots constitutes an actual danger.  A heavy industrial robot with powerful actuators and unpredictably complex behavior can cause harm, for instance by stepping on a human's foot or falling on a human.  Most industrial robots operate inside a security fence which separates them from human workers, but not all.  The first fatality involving a robot was [[Robert Williams (robot fatality)|Robert Williams]], who was struck by a robotic arm at a casting plant in [[Flat Rock, Michigan]] on January 25, 1979. <ref name="a">{{cite news|last=Kiska|first=Tim|title=Death on the job: Jury awards $10 million to heirs of man killed by robot at auto plant |pages=A10|publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=1983-08-11|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/PI/lib00187,0EB295F7D995F801.html |accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref>  The second was 37-year-old [[Kenji Urada]], a Japanese factory worker, in 1981. Urada was performing routine maintenance on the robot, but neglected to shut it down properly, and was accidentally pushed into a [[grinding machine]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7001829|title=Trust me, I'm a robot|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2006-06-08|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref>

==Literature==
{{see also|List of fictional robots and androids|Robots in literature}}
[[Image:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|An [[android]], or robot designed to resemble a human, can appear comforting to some people and disturbing to others<ref name="uncanny" />]]

Robotic characters, [[android]]s (artificial humans) and [[cyborg]]s (also "[[bionic]] men", or humans with significant mechanical enhancements) have become a staple of science fiction.

The first reference in Western literature to mechanical servants appears in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]]. In Book XVIII, [[Hephaestus]], god of fire, creates new armor for the hero Achilles, assisted by robots.<ref name="Iliad">{{cite web

}}</ref> According to the [[E. V. Rieu|Rieu]] translation, "Golden maidservants hastened to help their master. They looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods."  Of course, the words "robot" or "android" are not used to describe them, but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance.

The most prolific author of stories about robots was [[Isaac Asimov]] (1920–1992), who placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works.<ref>He wrote "over 460 books as well as thousands of articles and reviews", and was the "third most prolific writer of all time [and] one of the founding fathers of modern science fiction".  {{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: a life of the grand master of science fiction |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EWbMiyS9v98C |isbn=0786715189 |page=1-2 |author=White, Michael |date=2005 |publisher=Carroll & Graf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/SOS/Asimov.html|title=Asimov's Laws of Robotics - Implications for Information Technology|publisher=Australian National University/IEEE|author=R. Clarke|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> Asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans, and arrived at his [[Three Laws of Robotics]]: a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; a robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<ref>{{cite web

Later, Asimov added the Zeroth Law: "A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm"; the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' the first passage in Asimov's short story "[[Liar!]]" (1941) that mentions the First Law is the earliest recorded use of the word ''[[robotics]]''.  Asimov was not initially aware of this; he assumed the word already existed by analogy with ''mechanics,'' ''hydraulics,'' and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|author=White, Michael|title=Isaac Asimov: A Life of the Grand Master of Science Fiction|pages=56|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf|id=ISBN 0-7867-1518-9}}</ref>
