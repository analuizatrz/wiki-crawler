'''Vkhutemas''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]:''Вхутемас'', [[acronym]] for ''Высшие художественно-технические мастерские'' Higher Art and Technical Studios) was the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in [[Moscow]]. It was a center for three major movements in avant garde art and architecture: [[Constructivism]], [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]], and [[Suprematism]]. At the workshops, faculty and students transformed views of art and reality with the use of precise [[geometry]] with an emphasis on [[space]], in one of the great revolutions in the history of art.<ref name = "Shvedkovsky">D.

== Organization ==
The workshops were established in 1920 by a decree from [[Vladimir Lenin]]<ref name = "Shvedkovsky" /> with the intentions, in the words of the Soviet government, 'to prepare master artists of the highest qualifications for industry, and builders and managers for professional-technical education'.<ref name = "GSE">Great Soviet Encyclopedia, [http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/007/304.htm ''Вхутемас'']</ref><ref>''"подготовить художников-мастеров высшей квалификации для промышленности, а также конструкторов и руководителей для профессионально-технического образования"'' - Собрание узаконений и распоряжений Рабочего и Крестьянского Правительства, 1920, 19 декабря, № 98, ст. 522, с. 540 - Great Soviet Encyclopedia, [http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/007/304.htm ''Вхутемас'']</ref>The size of the school was in the range of 100 faculty members<ref name = "Kantor">Sybil Gordon Kantor, ''Alfred H. Barr, Jr., and the Intellectual Origins of the Museum of Modern Art'', MIT Press, 2002, ISBN 0262611961</ref> and an enrollment of 2500 students.<ref name ="Fry" /> The formation of Vkhutemas was a merger of two schools; the Moscow College of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture and the Stroganov School of Applied Arts, which had been an art school and craft school respectively.<ref>George Heard Hamilton, ''Painting and Sculpture in Europe, 1880-1940'', Yale University Press, 1993, page 315, ISBN 0300056494</ref> The workshops had artistic and industrial faculties, the art faculty taught courses in graphics, sculpture and architecture; the industrial faculty taught courses in printing, textiles, ceramics, woodworking, and metalworking.<ref name = "Kotovich">T. V. Kotovich, ''Encyclopedia of the Russian Avantgarde'', Minsk: Ekonompress, 2003, page 83.</ref> The industrial faculties had the task of preparing artists of a new type, artists capable of working not only in the traditional pictorial and plastic arts but also capable of creating all objects in the human environment such as the articles of daily life, the implements of labor, etc.<ref name = "GSE" /> 

An important part of this new teaching method which was developed and made compulsory for all students, and independently of future specialization, was a preliminary basic course. This was based on a combination of scientific and artistic disciplines. In the basic course, students had to learn the language of plastic forms, and chromatics. Drawing was considered a foundation of the plastic arts, and students investigated relationships between color and form, and the principles of spatial composition.<ref name = "GSE" />

Being a collection of workshops with art as the subject matter, the school had many informalities, including that the title of professor was not given.<ref>Martin H. Hammer, Christina Lodder, ''Constructing Modernity: The Art and Career of Naum Gabo'', Yale University Press, 2000, page 73, ISBN 0300076886</ref> However, those who taught at the school were the major figures in Soviet philosophy, art and architecture of the period, most of them associated with [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]: [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Vladimir Andreevic]], [[Aleksandr Larionov]], [[Vladimir Favorsky]], [[Konstantin Melnikov]], [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Naum Gabo]], [[El Lissitzky]], [[Nikolai Ladovsky]],  [[Moisei Ginzburg]], [[Meer Akselrod]] and [[Gustav Klutsis]]. In 1926 its name was modified: "Institute" instead of "Studios" (''Вхутеин, Высший художественно-технический институт''), or Vkhutein. It was dissolved in 1930, and its abstract formalism was seceded historically by [[Socialist Realism]] and the Empire style of [[Stalinist architecture]].<ref name = "RosDesign">M.

== Product design ==
The industrial department at Vkhutemas endeavored to create products to fulfill a role in the economy. Working class political requirements steered artists toward crafts, and the designing of household or industrial goods. Designs such as Rodechenko's tables contained mechanical moving parts, were standardized and multi-functional. The products designed at Vkhutemas never bridged the gap between workshops and factory production, although they cultivated a factory aesthetic—Popova, Stepanova, and Tatlin even designed worker's industrial apparel.<ref>Lewis H. Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, Page 114, ISBN 0521369878</ref> Pieces constructed at Vkhutemas explored the possibilities of plywood and tubular steel. As a new generation of artist/designers students and faculty made the way for designer furniture by architects such as [[Marcel Breuer]], and [[Alvar Aalto]] later in the century.<ref name = "Colquhoun">Alan Colquhoun, ''Modern Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2002, Pages 110, 125-126, ISBN 0192842269</ref> 

== Architectural schools ==
Architectural training at Vkhutemas was divided in two camps—the neoclassical school of [[Ivan Zholtovsky]], the first dean of the Architectural Department, and United Left Workshop or [[Obmas]] headed by [[Nikolai Ladovsky]]. A third independent department, Experimental Architecture, emerged in the 1924/1925 season, headed by non-conformists [[Konstantin Melnikov]] and [[Ilya Golosov]]. Through the basic course, architectonic art such as Constructivism and Suprematism, were also significant influences on the architectural design curricula.<ref name = "Curtis" /> 

Two competing Moscow architectural schools of the period were [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University|MVTU]] led by [[Alexander Kuznetsov]], and Moscow Institute of Civil Engineers led by the [[Vesnin brothers]]. This school merged with MVTU in 1924,<ref>Russian: С. О. Хан-Магомедов, Сто шедевров советского архитектурного авангарда, URSS, М., 2004, ISBN 5-354-00892-1 (''Khan-Magomedov, 2004''), p.54-67</ref> and it was also proposed that Vkhutemas be merged with MVTU in 1924 in an effort at consolidating architectural education.<ref>Catherine Cooke, Russian Avant-Garde: Theories of Art, Architecture, and the City, Academy Editions, 1995, (''Cooke, 1995''), p.89.</ref> The artistic and industrial design faculties were retained, further differentiating Vkhutemas from MVTU, which was focused more on engineering after acquiring the institute. MVTU was stronger for Constructivism in architecture,<ref>Cooke, 1995, p.93</ref> while Vkhutemas was based in the arts and design. Members of the [[OSA Group]] were divided between MVTU and Vkhutemas, participating in both schools. OSA staged the 'First Exhibition of Modern Architecture' exhibition at Vkhutemas in 1927.<ref>Cooke, 1995, p.169.</ref> Many of the faculty shared jobs with other colleges, and the student body was especially mobile. Vkhutemas absorbed many students who, in a better world, would have chosen a different profession. For example, Nadezhda Bykova, born in 1907 and raised in [[Serpukhov]], aspired to be a doctor, but since Serpukhov at that time was not eligible for admissions into medical school, she took a ticket to Vkhutemas and joined Ladovsky's class. In 1932 she designed [[Sokolniki (Metro)|her first subway station]] and eventually became one of the most prolific architects of the [[Moscow Metro]].<ref>Russian: Memoirs of Andrey Taranov, son of Nadezhda Bykova [http://www.architektor.ru/ai/2006/taranov1.htm]</ref> The educational system, like the society itself, was boiling and constantly changing. 

==== Academic Workshop ====
The original architectural department of Vkhutemas was the 'Academic Workshop'. It was a direct descendant of Zholtovsky's First Architectural Workshop which lasted from 1918 to 1919, and was heavily influenced by the personality of Ivan Zholtovsky and his staff of [[Alexey Shchusev]], and [[Ivan Rylsky]]. Zholtovsky practiced a peculiar style of education—which entailed lengthy conversations with very small groups of students (''беседы Жолтовского''), at the same time enforcing rigorous training in draftsmanship and classical composition.<ref>Khan-Magomedov, 2004, p.19-21</ref>

Zholtovsky also created a two-tier faculty organization with three resident and a few part-time 'managers' supervising a body of 'masters' - postgraduate-level instructors (Ladovsky, Golosov brothers, [[Nikolai Dokuchayev]] etc.). The system began breaking apart before Vkhutemas, as early as 1919, however, at this time in the end of Civil War, disgruntled 'masters' preferred to hold to Zholtovsky, at the same time practicing modernist art with numerous independent unions. Most important of these, the First Creative Union (''Первое Творческое объединение, Живскульптарх''), was actually made of unemployed architects<ref>Khan-Magomedov, 2004, p.45-47</ref>. By 1920, the breakaway faction consolidated around Nikolay Ladovsky, now the leader of [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalist architecture]]; the neoclassical minority shrank to a small group around Zholtovsky. In 1923, Zholtovsky left the country for three years, surrendering his Vkhutemas chair to Ladovsky.<ref>Khan-Magomedov, 2004, p.83</ref>

==== Nikolai Ladovsky Workshop ====
[[Image:OBMAS.JPG|thumb|right|Students in Obmas with models of project assignments in the discipline of "Space".]]
In the beginnning of the 1920/1921 training season, Ladovsky with fellow instructors Dokuchayev and [[Vladimir Krinsky]] set up Obmas. Obmas was an acronym for United Left Workshop (''Обмас, Объединенные левые мастерские'') these studios were active for three seasons and took over the whole Architectural Department in 1923. 

Ladovsky was known for his innovative teaching methods, notably his statement that the primary material of architecture was ''space''. His training program was superficially similar to classical training: first, study a particular architectural element of the past; then, use it in abstract drafts; finally, apply it to real-world architectural tasks ranging from seaside jetties (1922-1923) to skyscrapers (VSNKH Tower, 1924-1925)<ref>Khan-Magomedov, 2004, p.169, 217</ref>. To Ladovsky's own surprise, this program became a fountain of architectural novelties.<ref>Khan-Magomedov, 2004, p.52</ref> Here, at Obmas, creative concept of Rationalism was formulated,<ref name = "Kotovich" /> and the faculty and students within Obmas were in this way distinct from another prominent group within the school, the Constructivists.<ref name = "Colquhoun" />

In 1923, Ladovsky proceeded to found another Rationalist group, [[ASNOVA]].<ref>Sima Ingberman, ''ABC: International Constructivist Architecture, 1922-1939,'' MIT Press, 1994, Pages 13-15, ISBN 0262090317</ref> Between 1925 and 1930 Ladovsky's department at Vkhutemas-Vkhutein and [[Alexander Vesnin]]'s school at MVTU were engaged in a vocal professional competition of students' projects, which further separated the rationalist and constructivist arms of avant-garde architecture. <ref>Khan-Magomedov, 2004, p.66, 135</ref>

<!--==== Experimental Workshop ====
{{Expand-section|date=July 2007}}-->
== Lenin's visit ==
Vladimir Lenin signed a decree to create the school although its emphasis was on art rather than [[Marxism]].<ref name = "Shvedkovsky" /> Three months after its founding, on 25 February 1921,<ref name = "GSE" /> Lenin went to Vkhutemas to visit the daughter of [[Inessa Armand]]<ref>Margarita Tupitsyn, ''The Soviet Photograph, 1924-1937,'' Yale University Press, 1996, ISBN 0300064500</ref> and to converse with the students, where in a discussion about art with the students he found an affinity among them for [[Futurism]].<ref name = "Shvedkovsky" /> There he first viewed avant garde art, such as Suprematist painting and he did not wholly approve of it, expressing concern over the connection between the student's art and politics. After the discussion he was accepting and stated, "Well, tastes differ" and "I am an old man.".<ref>Susan Buck-Morss, ''Dreamworld and Catastrophe: The Passing of Mass Utopia in East and West,'' MIT Press, 2002, Page 301, ISBN 0262523310</ref> 

[[Image:Leonidov lenin institute.jpg|thumb|right|Model of the ''Lenin Institute'' by [[Ivan Leonidov]], 1927.]]
Although Lenin was not an enthusiast for avant garde art,<ref>Bernard Smith, ''Modernism's History: A Study in Twentieth-Century Art and Ideas,'' Yale University Press, 1998, Page 166, ISBN 0300073925</ref> projects were made at Vkhutemas, and by faculty and students in his honor and to further his politics. [[Ivan Leonidov]]'s final project at Vkhutemas was his design for a ''Lenin Institute'',<ref>Stephen Bann, ''The Tradition of Constructivism,'' Da Capo Press, 1990, Page xl, ISBN 0306803968</ref> Vladimir Tatlin's [[Tatlin's Tower|Monument to the Third International]] was built by students and displayed at their workshop in Saint Petersburg,<ref name = "Curtis" /> and [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] was designed by faculty member [[Aleksey Shchusev]]. [[Alexei Gan]]'s book, ''Constructivism'' published in 1922, provided a theoretical link between the new emerging art and contemporary politics, connecting Constructivism with revolution, and Marxism.<ref>Cooke, 1995, p.89.</ref> The founding decree included a statement that students have an 'obligatory education in political literacy and the fundamentals of the communist world view on all courses'.<ref>Cooke, 1995, p.161.</ref> These examples help justify the school's projects in terms of the early political requirements but others would arise throughout the school's existence. 

== Comparisons with the Bauhaus ==
Vkhutemas was closely parallel to the German [[Bauhaus]] in its intent, organization and scope. These two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner. Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture.<ref name = "GSE" /> Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus,<ref>Paul Wood, ''The Challenge of the Avant-Garde'', Yale University Press, 1999, Page 244, ISBN 0300077629</ref> but it has been significantly less promoted and less is known about it in the west.<ref name = "Fry">Tony Fry, Inc NetLibrary, ''A New Design Philosophy an Introduction to Defuturing'', UNSW Press, 1999, Page 161, ISBN 0868407534</ref> Vkhutemas' influence was expansive however—the school exhibited two structures by faculty and award winning student work<ref name = "Curtis">Penelope Curtis, ''Sculpture 1900-1945: After Rodin,'' Oxford University Press, 1999, Page 188, ISBN 0192842285</ref> at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes|1925 Exposition in Paris]]. Furthermore, Vkhutemas attracted the interest and several visits from the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Alfred Barr]].<ref name ="Kantor" /> With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus.<ref>Timothy J. Colton, ''Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis'', Harvard University Press, 1995, Page 215, ISBN 0674587499</ref> The second Bauhaus director [[Hannes Meyer]] attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while [[Hinnerk Scheper]] of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, [[El Lissitzky]]'s book ''Russia - an Architecture for World Revolution'' published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects. Both schools flourished in a relatively liberal period, and were closed under pressure from increasingly totalitarian regimes.
