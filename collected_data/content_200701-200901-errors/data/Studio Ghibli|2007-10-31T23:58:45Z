{{nihongo|'''Studio Ghibli, Inc.'''|株式会社スタジオジブリ|Kabushiki-gaisha Sutajio Jiburi}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[animation]] [[film studio]], and previously was a subsidiary of [[Tokuma Shoten]]. Its emotional [[anime]] films are widely praised all over the world. Its name derives from the nickname the [[Italy|Italians]] used for their [[Sahara]]n scouting planes in the [[Second World War]] (and later for the [[AMX International AMX]]), which derived from the Libyan word for ''hot wind blowing through the [[Sahara Desert]]'' (also known as [[sirocco]]). Though the Italian word is pronounced with hard /g/, the Japanese pronunciation of the studio's name is ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ˌdʲʑiːbɹiː] or [ˌdʲʑiːbɝiː]}}) ''{{Audio|Ghibli.ogg|listen}}''. The theory behind the name was that the studio was blowing a new wind into the Japanese anime industry. The company's logo features the character Totoro from the film ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''.

Anime created by Studio Ghibli that have won the [[Animage]] Anime Grand Prix award have been ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' in 1986, ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' in 1988, and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'' in 1989.

==History==
Founded in 1985, it is headed by the acclaimed director [[Hayao Miyazaki]] along with his colleague and mentor [[Isao Takahata]], as well as the studio's executive managing director and long-time producer [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]]. Its origins date back to 1983, with the film ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind]]'', which was popularized as a serialized [[manga]] in a publication of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s ''[[Animage]]'' magazine after the original screenplay was rejected. The film was eventually produced by Topcraft and the film's success spurred the formation of Ghibli. Much of Ghibli's works are distributed in [[Japan]] by the noted film distributor [[Toho]]. Tokuma is the parent company of Studio Ghibli, and it has provided [[the Walt Disney Company]] with the video rights to all of Ghibli's output that did not have previous international distribution, including the global, non-Japan distribution rights to ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and ''[[Spirited Away]]''. Miyazaki's latest film, ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'', was based on a book by British author [[Diana Wynne Jones]], published in several countries including Canada and the United States. Composer [[Joe Hisaishi]] has provided the soundtrack for all of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films.

The most famous and lauded film from the studio that was not directed by Miyazaki is ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'', directed by [[Isao Takahata]], a sad film focusing on the lives of two war orphans towards the end of [[Second World War]] in Japan.  This is the only film which Disney declined to distribute.

Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine ''[[Animage]]'', which regularly runs exclusive articles about the studio and its members in a section titled "Ghibli Notes." Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works frequently graces the cover of the magazine. 

The company is well-known for its strict "no-edits" policy in licensing their films abroad. This has stemmed from the disastrous dubbing of Miyazaki's ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind]]'' when the film was released in the [[United States]] as ''[[Warriors of the Wind]]''. The film was heavily edited and [[Americanized]], with significant portions cut and the plot rewritten. The "no cuts" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman [[Harvey Weinstein]] suggested editing ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' to make it more marketable. In response, one of Studio Ghibli producers sent an authentic [[katana]] with a simple message: "No cuts".<ref>{{cite news |title=A god among animators |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1569689,00.html 
|first=Xan |last=Brooks |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[2005-09-14]] |quote=There is a rumour that when Harvey Weinstein was charged with handling the US release of Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki sent him a samurai sword in the post. Attached to the blade was a stark message: 'No cuts.' / The director chortles. 'Actually, my producer did that.' |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

Miyazaki is currently working on a new film, ''[[Gake no ue no Ponyo]]'', literally "Ponyo on a Cliff."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ghibliworld.com/news.html#1903|title=Ghibli World|date=2007-03-19|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>  It will be released in summer of 2008, while Takahata is currently working on a new film as well (with no title yet), that will be released in 2008 or 2009.
