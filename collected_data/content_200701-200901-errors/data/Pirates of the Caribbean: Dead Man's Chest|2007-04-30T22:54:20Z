The sequel is again directed by [[Gore Verbinski]] and produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. 

[[Johnny Depp]], [[Orlando Bloom]] and [[Keira Knightley]] reprise their roles as [[Captain Jack Sparrow]], [[Will Turner]] and [[Elizabeth Swann]], respectively. Also returning are [[Jack Davenport]] as Commodore [[James Norrington]] and [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[Weatherby Swann|Governor Weatherby Swann]]. Joining the cast are [[Bill Nighy]], who portrays the villainous [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] and [[Stellan Skarsgård]] playing Will Turner's father, [["Bootstrap Bill" Turner]]. 

The film was released in Australia and the United Kingdom on [[July 6]], [[2006]], and in the United States and Canada on  [[July 7]], [[2006]]. The movie set several records in its first three days, with an opening weekend of $135,600,000. As of its date of close, [[December 7]] [[2006]], the film has made $423,315,812 in the U.S. and became the third film to reach the $1,000,000,000 worldwide mark, with $1,065,659,812. ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' is set to follow on [[May 25]], [[2007]].

==Production==
Information about the two sequels to ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' was presented at a [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] Investor Conference Studio Presentation in 2005. The title for the first sequel was revealed to be ''Dead Man's Chest'', and a second sequel was promised for a May [[2007 in film|2007]] theatrical release.

Locations were in the Costa Alegre, in [[Jalisco]] ([[Mexico]]) and [[Barrouallie]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent]]. The sequel also includes [[location shooting]] in [[Dominica]] as well as [[The Bahamas]]. The filmmakers are largely shooting the two sequels [[List of films produced back-to-back|back-to-back]], à la ''[[The Matrix series|The Matrix]]'' and "[[Back to the Future trilogy|Back to the Future ]]" trilogies, although throughout [[2005]] primary filming was for ''Dead Man's Chest'', with only a handful of scenes for the third movie being shot. Because of the back-to-back setup, filming for ''At World's End'' was not finished until [[February 7]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wordplayer.com/forums/moviesarc07/index.cgi?read=83160 | title=MOVIES Message Board - ARCHIVE 7 | author=Ted Elliott | publisher=Wordplay Forums | accessdate=2006-07-09}}</ref> During production, the "tank" set where many of the shipboard sequences are filmed was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Wilma]].<ref>{{cite video | title = According to Plan: The Harrowing and True Story of Dead Man's Chest | medium = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | year = 2006}}</ref>

''Dead Man's Chest'' premiered at [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]] on [[June 24]] [[2006]], two days prior to the reopening day of the refurbished [[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] attraction on which the movie series is based. The refurbished attraction includes an adjusted storyline and [[Audio-Animatronic|Audio Animatronics]] based on the movies and opened [[June 26]] [[2006]]. The same attraction at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Florida]] also underwent refurbishment to feature captain Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and an appearance by the films' supernatural character Davy Jones as part of the attraction and reopened on [[July 6]] [[2006]] in conjunction with the film's theatrical release.

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
As the age of [[piracy]] nears its end, a new threat appears in [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]]&mdash;the [[East India Trading Company]] (EITC). Spearheading the company's monopolistic takeover in the Caribbean is [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]], a powerful and ruthless EITC agent. Beckett intends to eradicate all pirates from the area. To this end, he arrests [[Elizabeth Swann]] and [[Will Turner]] shortly before their wedding ceremony, threatening to execute them and the absent ex-Commodore [[James Norrington]] for abetting [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow's]] escape. What Beckett really wants, however, is Sparrow and his magical compass, and he coerces Will into searching for both by offering [[clemency]].

While Elizabeth is in jail, Will searches for Jack. An informant in [[Tortuga]] leads him to the [[Black Pearl]] that is run aground on [[Pelegosto]], a [[cannibal]]-inhabited island where Jack and his crew are captive. Jack hid there after being visited by his former crew mate, [["Bootstrap Bill" Turner]], who is now an indentured sailor on the ghost ship, the ''[[The Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]''. Bootstrap delivered the ''Black Spot'' to Jack, a mark that his debt to [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Captain Davy Jones]] is due. Thirteen years previously, Jones raised the ''Black Pearl'' (formerly known as the Wicked Wench) from the ocean floor and made Jack her captain. In exchange, Jack must now serve aboard the ''Dutchman'' for 100 years or face Jones' leviathan, the [[The Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]]. 

Will, Jack and the crew escape, unexpectedly recruiting escapees [[Pintel and Ragetti]] as they are attempting to commandeer the ''Pearl'', and head to sea. Jack has been searching for a key that leads to untold riches, but his magical compass fails. He agrees to give Will the compass if he helps him find the key and what it unlocks. Seeking assistance from [[Tia Dalma]], a voodoo priestess, Jack learns the compass will not work because he does not know what he truly wants&mdash;or he knows but is unable to claim it as his own. The key, Tia tells him, unlocks the ''Dead Man's Chest'' containing Davy Jones' beating [[heart]]. When the pain of lost love was too much to bear, Jones carved it from his chest and buried it. Whoever possesses the heart controls Davy Jones, thereby controlling the oceans. Back at sea, the Flying Dutchman encounters Sparrow, who deviously attempts to barter Will in exchange for himself. But Jones demands 100 souls within three days for Jack’s freedom and keeps Will as a "good faith payment." 

In Port Royal, Governor [[Weatherby Swann]] frees Elizabeth. Confronting Beckett at gunpoint, she forces him to validate a [[Letter of Marque]]&mdash;a royal document with which Beckett intends to recruit Sparrow as a [[privateer]] and that Elizabeth wants for Will. Stowing away on a merchant vessel, Elizabeth lands in [[Tortuga]] where she finds Jack and [[Joshamee Gibbs|Gibbs]] recruiting unsuspecting sailors in a pub. A fallen James Norrington also applies. Blaming Sparrow for his ruin, he tries to shoot the captain and ignites a brawl. Elizabeth knocks him out to save him from the angry mob. At the dock, Jack reveals the compass' secret to Elizabeth; it points to what the holder wants most in the world. When he convinces her that she can save Will by finding the chest, she gets a bearing. Once the ship is underway, tension arises between Jack and Elizabeth when each discovers the compass now points to the other. It is unclear if they desire one another or if each seeks the other as a means to obtain what they truly want. 
[[Image:JackDMC.jpg|left|thumb|225px|Jack opens the Dead Man's Chest containing Jones' heart.]]

On [[Isla Cruces]], Jack, Norrington, and Elizabeth find the Dead Man's Chest. Will, who has escaped the ''Dutchman'' with help from his father, Bootstrap Bill, arrives with the key that he stole from Davy Jones. Will wants to stab the heart to free his father, but a three-way duel erupts between Jack, Norrington, and Will, each claiming it; the arrival of Jones' crew and Ragetti and Pintel trying to make off with the chest further complicate matters. It is Norrington who ultimately escapes with the heart and the Letter of Marque while Jones’ crewmen retrieve a now-empty chest.

[[Image:Jack VS.. The Kraken.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Jack battles the Kraken.]]
The Flying Dutchman pursues the Black Pearl, but with the wind behind them, the Pearl outruns her. Jones ends the pursuit and instead summons the Kraken. In a moment of cowardice, Jack abandons the ship in a longboat, but unable to desert his crew, he returns in time to save them. He gives the order to abandon ship before the Kraken makes its final assault. ‎Realizing the Kraken is only hunting Jack, a deceptive Elizabeth kisses him while handcuffing him to the mast. Racked with guilt over her deceit, she tells the others Jack chose to remain behind, unaware Will witnessed the scene and now believes she loves Sparrow. Freeing himself from the shackles, Jack charges the Kraken, but the colossal beast drags him and the ''Pearl'' to a watery grave. Watching from his ship, Davy Jones declares their debt settled, although he soon discovers the chest is empty.

Arriving in Port Royal, Norrington presents the heart and the Letters of Marque to Lord Beckett in a bid to regain his career. Cutler Beckett now controls the seas. Meanwhile, the grieving crew seeks refuge with Tia Dalma. Consoling them, she asks if they would sail to the World's End to return Jack and the ''Black Pearl''. When they agree, she says they will need a captain who knows those waters. To everyone's shock, the formerly dead [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]] descends the stairs, eating an apple, and demanding to know what has become of his ship.

After the credits, the jailhouse dog that the cannibals chased earlier in the film has been crowned chief and is presumably about to be eaten by them.

===Critical reaction===
After months of anticipation and industry hype, reviews for ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' were mixed, as the film scored a 54% "Rotten" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest | title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref> Among the positive critics were Michael Booth of the [[Denver Post]], who awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising it as "two hours and 20 minutes of escapism that once again makes the movies safe for guilt-free fun."<ref>{{cite web | title = Aye, mates: "Pirates" sequel is worth the doubloons
| url = http://www.denverpost.com/movies/ci_4016344 | accessdate = 2006-07-23 }}</ref> On the other hand, critic [[Michael Medved]] gave the film two stars out of four, calling the plot "sloppy, ...convoluted and insipid."<ref>{{cite web | title = Michael Medved's Eye On Entertainment
| url = http://images.michaelmedved.com/images/pdf/pirates_revised.pdf | format = PDF
| accessdate = 2006-07-11 }}</ref> Ironically, after featuring a cover story on the film, magazine [[Entertainment Weekly]]'s critic  Lisa Schwarzbaum awarded the film a D+, slamming the film as "a hellish contraption." Although the film's greatest critic was British film critic Mark Kermode, who described the film as 'indicitive of the death of western civilization'.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1210274,00.html | title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest | Movie Review | publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> Still, viewers were generally more positive, as the film currently holds a 7.4/10 user rating on the [[Internet Movie Database]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383574/ | title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) | publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref>

=== Influence ===
The [[dice game]] played aboard the ''Dutchman'' is the 1993 ''[[Spiel des Jahres]]'' award-winning [[Liar's Dice]].  The film sparked interest in the game, leading to both branded and unbranded reprints of the game, and renewing interest in dice games in general.  At the 2007 [[Nuremberg International Toy Fair]] dice game spinoffs of many [[designer game]] franchises were announced, including ''[[Settlers of Catan]]: The Dice Game'' and ''[[Alhambra (game)|Alhambra]]: The Dice Game''.

==Trivia==
{{too much trivia}}
*Walt Disney Pictures has been questioned by the National Garifuna Council, a representative body of the [[Garifuna]] people, for what they feel is a racist portrayal of the Calinago, or [[Caribs]], as [[cannibal]]s in ''Dead Man's Chest''. The Council called for what they considered to be a fair and accurate representation, and Disney responded that the script could not be altered. No known changes were made to the film.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4263227.stm | title=Film row over Pirates 'cannibals'|date=[[February 14]] [[2005]] | publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.seinebight.com/Disney-Garinagu.htm | title=Letter from Michael Polonio to Walt Disney Company-Must Read | publisher=Seine Bight | author=Michael Polonio | accessdate=2006-07-09}}</ref>

*This was also the first Disney film to use a new computer-generated Disney [[production logo]] before the film.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002802054 | title=Old Disney magic in new animated logo | publisher=[[hollywood Reporter|hollywoodreporter.com]] | accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref> The first movie had no opening logos.
* According to Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot, the shot of Elizabeth clinging to Jack's leg as he prepares to shoot the powder keg was directly influenced by the work of [[Frank Frazetta]].
* In the Pelegosto scene, Leech, one of Jack's crew, makes an off comment about how only six of the remaining crew are truly needed to salvage the Pearl, and, ironically he and the rest of the men die moments later, leaving only the six more important crewmen (including Gibbs and Will). This is (apparently) a self mocking in-joke about the [[character shields]] that exist within the series, and definitely in this movie in itself.
* According to the film's writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio in the Dead Man's Chest DVD commentary, the captain that Mercer kills at the pier is named Hawkins, and is meant to be the father of Jim Hawkins, the lead character in Robert Louis Stevenson's [[Treasure Island]]. The writers claim that in the novel, Jim's father disappeared without a trace, and thus decided to supply an explanation. However, Jim's father never leaves home in the novel, and in fact dies from an illness in chapter three, rather than at the hands of the East Indian Trading Company.
* Keira Knightley had to wear hair extensions during the filming of the movie. This was because her hair had been cut short for her role in ''[[Domino (film)|Domino]]''.
*This film grossed 135.6 million dollars in its opening weekend, making it the first film to beat Spider-Man's opening weekend which was 114.8 million.  In the episode '[[One Day in the Valley]]' of the fictional HBO series [[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]] , which premiered in June 2006 (a month before this film), Vincent Chase's film, Aquaman, opened with 120 million plus in its opening weekend.  On July 12, 2006, while reporting on box office totals, CNBC anchor Joe Kernan stated, "Disney was the big winner . . . 'Pirates' plunders the box office, making $132 million in its first three days at the box office. The previous three-day record was 'Aquaman' at $120-plus, which beat out the 115 million which was set back by 'Spider-Man' back in May of '02' ".  It was later revealed that he said it as a joke.
