'''Albert Benjamin Chandler, Sr.''' ([[July 14]] [[1898]] &ndash; [[June 15]] [[1991]]) was twice [[governor of Kentucky]], a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and the 2nd [[Baseball Commissioner]]. His jovial attitude earned him the nickname "Happy," which stuck for the remainder of his life.<ref name=powell>{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Robert A. |title=''Kentucky Governors'' |publisher=Bluegrass Printing Company |location=[[Danville, Kentucky]] |year=1976 |isbn=B0006CPOVM |chapter=Albert Benjamin Chandler}}</ref>

==Early life==
Chandler was born [[July 14]], [[1898]] in [[Corydon, Kentucky|Corydon]], [[Henderson County, Kentucky|Henderson County]] [[Kentucky]] the son of Joseph Sephus and Callie Saunders-Chandler. His childhood was a difficult one. According to his [[autobiography]], his earliest memory was his mother abandoning the family when he was four years old, and at sixteen, his only brother, two years younger than he, was fatally wounded when he fell from a cherry tree he was picking from.<ref name=chandler>{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=Happy |title=Heroes, Plain Folks, and Skunks: The Life and Times of Happy Chandler |coauthors=Trimble, Vance H. |others=foreword by [[Bob Hope]] |publisher=Bonus Books, Inc. |location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] |year=1989}}</ref> Though cared for by his father and other relatives, by age eight, he was selling newspapers to supplement the family's income. 

Chandler graduated high school in 1917, and, against his father's wishes, enrolled [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], with only "a red sweater, a [[five dollar bill]], and a smile." During his matriculation, he starred in three sports, captaining the [[basketball]] and [[baseball]] teams, and playing [[quarterback]] on the [[American football|football]] team. He also joined the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity after being denied membership in [[Kappa Alpha]]. All the while, he worked odd jobs to support himself. In the fall semester of 1918, with his nation in the midst of [[World War I]], Chandler volunteered to serve in the Student Army Training Corps, although the corps disbanded with the signing of an armistice in November.<ref name=chandler />

Chandler graduated from Transylvania in [[1921]], taking with him both a [[bachelor's degree]] and his life-long nickname.<ref name=harrison>{{cite book |title=''Kentucky's Governors'' |editor=Lowell H. Harrison |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |year=1985 |isbn=0813115396 |chapter=Albert Benjamin Chandler 1898-}}</ref> From there, Chandler studied at [[Harvard Law School]], coaching high school athletics to earn money. He returned to Lexington in 1922, attaining a [[Bachelor of Laws]] from the [[University of Kentucky]] two years later. Again, he funded his education by coaching high school sports in nearby [[Versailles, Kentucky|Versailles]].<ref name=powell />

For the next five years, Chandler was an assistant football coach at [[Centre College]] in [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]], simultaneously practicing law Versailles.<ref name=powell /> 

While representing Margaret Hall, an Episcopal girls school, Chandler met [[Keysville, Virginia]] native Mildred Watkins. He became infatuated and eventually persuaded his new love to break her engagement to another man. Despite Watkins' eventual confession of having been married previously and being the mother of a two-year-old daughter, the two married on [[November 12]], [[1925]]. Chandler immediately adopted Watkins' daughter, Marcella, and the couple eventually had three children together: Mimi, Ben and Dan.<ref name=chandler />

==Early political career==
Chandler's career in politics began with an appointment by Judge Ben Williams to the post of master commissioner of the [[Woodford County, Kentucky|Woodford County]] Circuit Court in 1928.<ref name=chandler /> Only a year later, he was elected to represent Kentucky's 22<sup>nd</sup> Senate District in the [[Kentucky General Assembly]]. He made a name for himself primarily on two issues: the repeal of [[parimutuel betting]] and a plan to build a hydroelectric dam on [[Cumberland Falls]]. Chandler successfully opposed both proposals.<ref name=chandler />

===Split with Governor Laffoon===
In 1931, Chandler was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]] of the state by a wide margin.<ref name=powell /> Although Chandler and the elected governor, [[Ruby Laffoon]] were both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], Chandler soon split with his running mate and ended up working against many of his programs, particularly on the issue of a state [[sales tax]], which Laffoon supported but Chandler opposed. As lieutenant governor, Chandler also served as the presiding officer in the state senate, though his political opponents passed measures to limit his customary powers in retaliation for his split with Laffoon.<ref name=harrison />

Laffoon had hand-picked Thomas Rhea to succeed him as governor, but Chandler had other ideas. Advised by political allies, Chandler made the boldest move of his political career. Acting as governor while Laffoon was out of the state &ndash; as provided by the [[Kentucky Constitution]] at the time &ndash; Chandler called the legislature into special session and pushed through a bill calling for candidates for governor to be chosen by [[Primary election|primaries]] rather than elected at the party conventions. This bucking of the [[political machine]] made him a hero in the eyes of the people.<ref name=harrison />

===First term as governor===
Chandler did succeed in his bid for governor in 1935, defeating Rhea in a runoff primary and disposing of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challenger King Swope by a hefty margin. At a mere 37 years old, Chandler was dubbed the "Boy Governor" As promised, he quickly oversaw the repeal of the state's sales tax, compensating for the financial loss to the state by raising [[excise tax|excise]] and [[income tax|income]] taxes.<ref name=kye>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D. Clark]], Lowell H. Harrison, and James C. Klotter |title=''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' |year=1992 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |isbn=0813117720 |chapter=Chandler, Albert Benjamin}}</ref> The 1935 repeal of Kentucky's prohibition amendment gave Chandler a further source of revenue &ndash; a tax on [[whiskey]]. Frugality and fiscal responsibility became hallmarks of Chandler's administration. The Government Reorganization Act of 1936 so streamlined the state's [[bureaucracy]] that Chandler was able to cut the state's outstanding debt by 75%, a whopping $28.5 million.<ref name=harrison /> 

Chandler did spend when necessary, however. He supported the state's Old Age Pension Law<ref name=eok>{{cite book |title=''The Encyclopedia of Kentucky'' |publisher=Somerset Publishers |location=[[New York, New York]] |year=1987 |isbn=0403099811}}</ref> and created a pension fund for the state's teachers. In 1936, he allocated $2 million to improve the state's rural roads and led the state to participate in the federal [[Rural Electrification Act]]. He further provided for free textbooks for students in public schools, and dramatically increased funding for schools, colleges, and universities in the state. By the end of Chandler's first year in office, University of Kentucky president Frank L. McVey proclaimed that "much more has been accomplished than would have been thought possible."<ref name=harrison />

Chandler's heroics continued during the [[Ohio River flood of 1937]], when he personally supervised the evacuation of a partly-flooded [[penitentiary]] in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]]. Though he opposed the [[closed shop]] and [[sit-down strike]] tactics used by the state's [[labor union]]s, Chandler also earned a reputation as a friend of organized labor by creating a state Department of Industrial Relations and supporting the federal [[Child Labor Amendment]], though it was never ratified.<ref name=harrison /> During his tenure as governor, he earned [[Doctor of Laws]] degrees from Transylvania (1936) and the [[University of Kentucky College of Law]] (1937).<ref name=powell />

===Service in the United States Senate===
In 1938, while still serving as governor, Chandler challenged [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] (and future [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]) [[Alben Barkley]] in the Democratic primary for Barkley's seat in Congress. Though Chandler lost to the very popular Barkley, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] felt compelled to make a trip to the state to support Barkley's candidacy, just in case.<ref name=kye />

Chandler would get his chance at the [[United States Senate|Senate]] soon enough, however. In 1939, the state's junior Senator, [[M. M. Logan]], died. Under an arrangement with Lieutenant Governor [[Keen Johnson]], Chandler resigned his position, elevating Johnson to the governorship. Johnson, in turn, appointed Chandler to fill Logan's seat in the Senate. Chandler retained the seat in a special election in 1940, and was re-elected to a full term in [[1942]], defeating former ally [[John Y. Brown (1835-1904)|John Y. Brown]].<ref name=harrison /> 

During his tenure in the Senate, Chandler usually backed the policies of President Roosevelt. As a member of the Senate's Military Affairs Committee, he was vocal in his opposition to prioritizing the European front over defeating [[Japan]] in [[World War II]].<ref name=harrison /> He and five other senators toured American military bases, successfully lobbying to strengthen those in the [[Aleutian Islands]] area.<ref name=shriners>{{cite web |url=http://www.shriners.bc.ca/shriners/chandler.shtml |title=Albert Benjamin "Happy" Chandler |publisher=Gizeh Shriners of British Columbia |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> It was also during his time in the Senate that he developed a friendship with comedian [[Bob Hope]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Regalado |first=Samuel O. |year=1990 |month=Spring |title=Review of ''Heroes, Plain Folks, and Skunks: The Life and Times of Happy Chandler'' |journal=''Journal of Sports History'' |volume=17 |issue=1 |url=http://www.aafla.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1990/JSH1701/jsh1701p.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref>

==Baseball Commissioner==
When baseball's first [[Baseball Commissioner|commissioner]], Judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], passed away in 1944, an official in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] began campaigning for Chandler's election to the post. Despite being the last candidate put forth in the April [[1945 in baseball|1945]] meetings, he was elected by a unanimous vote of the team owners, and resigned his Senate seat in October of that year.<ref name=mlb>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_people.jsp?story=com_bio_2 |title=Albert Benjamin "Happy" Chandler |publisher=Major League Baseball |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> He remained in that post until [[1951 in baseball|1951]]. 

During his service, he presided over the establishment of a pension fund for players, but his most significant contribution was overseeing the initial steps toward [[Baseball color line|integration]] of the major leagues, beginning with the debut of [[Jackie Robinson]] with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in [[1947]]. This move was controversial with some team owners and was credited by many in the sports community with Chandler's failure to be selected for another term as Commissioner after the expiration of his first one in 1951.<ref name=harrison /> He once said, "I don't believe in barring Negroes from baseball just because they are Negroes."

==Second term as governor==
After being forced out as Baseball Commissioner, Chandler returned to Versailles and continued to practice law. His hiatus from public life would be short lived, however. While prohibited by the [[Kentucky Constitution]] from serving ''consecutive'' terms as governor, nothing prohibited Chandler from seeking a second gubernatorial term in 1955, twenty years after his first bid. He secured the Democratic nomination over challenger [[Bert T. Combs]], and took the general election from Republican Edwin R. Denny by landslide.<ref name=kye />

Much had changed in the years since Chandler's first term as governor. In 1948, he had embraced the "[[Dixiecrats]]," a Southern faction that had broken from the national Democratic Party, and their segregationist presidential nominee, [[Strom Thurmond]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} This move had alienated him from some in his own party at the state level as well. Nevertheless, he was able to make positive changes in the state in his second term, continuing his themes of improving education and [[public works]]. He oversaw the establishment of the [[Chandler Medical Center|University of Kentucky Medical Center]] which bears his name. Having already integrated baseball, in 1956, Chandler used [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] troops to enforce [[racial integration]] of schools in two Kentucky towns.<ref name=kye />

==Later career==
Chandler remained active in Kentucky politics long after his final term as governor ended. In his later life he often mounted quixotic campaigns to return to office, becoming something of a [[perennial candidate]]. Chandler lost in the 1963 Democratic primary for governor to [[Edward T. Breathitt]] and that was his final serious campaign. In 1968 [[George C. Wallace]] strongly considered Chandler as his running mate but instead chose General [[Curtis LeMay]]. Chandler ran weak campaigns for governor in 1967 and 1971, the latter as an Independent. Chandler is sometimes credited with having created the phrase, "I didn't leave the Democratic Party; the Democratic Party left me!"

In his last years, Chandler remained active as a University of Kentucky Board of Trustees member. He was also an occasional guest singer for the traditional singing of "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]" (sung before sporting events in Kentucky after "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" and after basketball games at [[Rupp Arena]]). He always received wild applause for this, and in his last two years, when he had to be helped to walk onto the playing floor to perform, he was met with a standing ovation.

During a meeting of the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees finance committee on [[April 5]], [[1988]], Chandler drew the ire of several student groups by using a racial [[epithet]]. During a discussion of the university's 1985 decision to dispose of its investments in [[South Africa]], Chandler, a member of the Board, remarked "You know [[Zimbabwe]]'s all nigger now. There aren't any whites."<ref name=nyt>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DB1F3DF934A35757C0A96E948260 |title= SPORTS PEOPLE; Chandler Criticized |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=[[1988-04-07]] |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> He later apologized.

==Legacy==
{{MLB HoF}}
Chandler was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1982 in baseball|1982]].<ref name=bballhall>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers%5Fand%5Fhonorees/hofer%5Fbios/chandler%5Fhappy.htm |title=Happy Chandler |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame |accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref> He died at age 92 in [[Versailles, Kentucky]] and is buried at the Pisgah Church Cemetery in Versailles.<ref name=congbio />

Chandler's grandson [[Ben Chandler|A. B. "Ben" Chandler III]] was elected to statewide office three times (Auditor of Public Accounts in 1991 and [[Attorney General of Kentucky|Attorney General]] in 1995 and 1999), won the Democratic primary for governor in 2003 but lost in the general election to [[Ernie Fletcher]], and was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 2004.

At the time of his death, Chandler was the earliest U.S. governor of any state still living; he had held that distinction since the death of [[Alfred M. Landon]]. After Chandler's death, the title was passed to [[Harold E. Stassen]].
