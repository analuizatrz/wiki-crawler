'''Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area''' is an [[List of Illinois state parks|Illinois state park]] on {{convert|1350|acre|sqkm|2|}} in [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The park was established in the late 1960s and is named for the [[natural spring]] within its boundaries. The park has two [[artificial lake]]s and the [[Fox River (Illinois)|Fox River]] flows through the northern end of the park. Silver Springs hosts a variety of activities including fishing, hunting, boating and hiking. The park has areas of native [[prairie restoration]], a sledding hill and a seven mile equestrian trail. The prairie restoration areas hold many species of plants including [[lead plant]], and [[purple coneflower]].

==History==
There is evidence that the [[Fox River (Illinois)|Fox River]] valley near Silver Springs was populated by indigenous people near the end of the last [[Ice Age]], 10&ndash;14,000 years ago.<ref name=idnr2/> The original {{convert|1250|acre|sqkm|2|lk=on}} tract of land that became Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area was purchased by the state of [[Illinois]] in 1969, and has been open since January of that year.<ref name=idnr/><ref name=trib/> The park is located in [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall County]], [[Illinois]], five miles west of the city of [[Yorkville, Illinois|Yorkville]]. Since the original acquisition in 1969, {{convert|100|acre|sqkm|2|lk=}} have been added to the park<ref name=idnr/> 

Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area was one of five new state parks opened in northern Illinois from 1969&ndash;1971. As part of more than {{convert|20000|acre|sqkm|2|lk=}} added to the [[Illinois state parks|Illinois state park]] system during this period, Silver Springs opened to alleviate traffic at other state parks in the area. At the time, the [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]] (IDNR), which oversees the state park system, was attempting to provide the [[Chicago area]] with the most state park facilities in Illinois.<ref name=trib>Bukro, Casey. "New State Park openings", ([http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=597244632&sid=2&Fmt=2&clientId=8829&RQT=309&VName=HNP ProQuest]), ''Chicago Tribune'', [[27 June]] [[1971]]. Retrieved [[30 October]] [[2007]].</ref>

The park had nine extant [[water well|well]]s tapping the Galena&ndash;Platteville Aquifer when the state purchased the property. By 1973 a modern well was drilled, reaching a depth of 120 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] (36.6 [[meter|m]]). The well, located near the park entrance, was drilled by K & K Well Drilling Co. of [[Mokena, Illinois]] through black dirt, [[gravel]], [[clay]], and [[limestone]]. Upon completion, the well produced about 500 [[gallon]]s (1,892 [[liter|l]]) per day during the summer. The well provides the park with water, but the other nine wells remained in use following its completion.<ref name=groundwater>Woller, Dorothy M. and Gibb, James P.

A [[prairie restoration]] project began on {{convert|30|acre|sqkm|2|lk=}} within Silver Springs in 1980; {{convert|15|acre|sqkm|2|lk=|pl}} was added to the restoration project in 1991.<ref name=idnr>"[http://dnr.state.il.us/Lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R2/SILVERSP.HTM Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area]," ''Illinois Department of Natural Resources'', official site. Retrieved [[12 October]] [[2007]].</ref> The IDNR undertook another prairie restoration in an area within the park, on the north side of the Fox River, in 2002. For the 2002 project, the IDNR removed numerous [[invasive species]] from the area including: [[basswood]], [[Ash tree|ash]], [[maple]], and exotic [[honeysuckle]]. The non-native exotic honeysuckle species had thrived in the absence of fire through human intervention. These actions were meant to allow native [[burr oak|burr]] and [[black oak]], and [[Shagbark Hickory|shagbark hickory]] a chance to reproduce.<ref name=baratta/>
