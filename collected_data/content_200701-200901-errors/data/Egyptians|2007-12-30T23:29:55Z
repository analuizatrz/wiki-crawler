The '''Egyptians''' ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''{{Unicode|rmṯnkm.t}}''; [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Coptic|ⲛⲓⲣⲉⲙ'ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} ''ni.ramenkīmi''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مِصريّون ''{{Unicode|miṣriyūn}}''; [[Egyptian Arabic|Masri]]: مَصريين ''{{Unicode|maṣreyyīn}}'') are a [[nation]] and a [[North Africa]]n ethnic group native to [[Egypt]]. Egyptian identity is rooted in the lower [[Nile Valley]], the small strip of cultivatable land stretching from the [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and enclosed by vast deserts. This unique geography has been the basis of the development of Egyptian society in [[Ancient Egypt|antiquity]].

The Egyptian people have spoken only languages from the northern branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] throughout their history, from old [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] to today's vernacular [[Egyptian Arabic]]. Their religion is predominantly [[Sunni Islam]] with a [[Shia]] minority and a significant proportion who follow native [[Sufi]] [[tariqah|orders]].<ref name="Hoffman">Hoffman, Valerie J.

==Names of the Egyptians==

*'''{{Unicode|Rmṯ}} (n) km.t''' – This is the native [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name of the people of the Nile Valley, literally 'People of Kemet' (i.e., Egypt). In [[Ancient Egypt|antiquity]], it was often rendered simply as ''{{Unicode|Rmṯ}}'' or '(the) People.' The name is vocalized '''{{Unicode|ramenkīmi}}''' {{Coptic|ⲣⲉⲙⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} in the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] stage of the language, meaning Egyptian ([[Sahidic]] dialect: '''{{Unicode|remnekēme}}''' {{Coptic|ⲣⲙⲛⲕⲏⲙⲉ}}) — and '''{{Unicode|ni.ramenkīmi}}''' {{Coptic|ⲛⲓⲣⲉⲙⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} with the plural definite article, i.e., Egyptians,

*'''Copts''' ({{Unicode|qibṭ, qubṭ}} قبط) – Under Muslim rule, the Egyptians came to be known as [[Copt]]s, a derivative of the Greek word {{Polytonic|Αἰγύπτιος}}, ''Aiguptios'' (Egyptian), from {{Polytonic|Αἰγύπτος}}, ''Aiguptos'' (Egypt). The Greek name in turn may be derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''{{Unicode|ḥw.t-ka-ptḥ}}'', literally "Estate (or 'House') of [[Ptah]]", the name of the temple complex of the god [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. After the majority of Egyptians converted from [[Christianity]] to [[Islam]], the term became exclusively associated with [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Christianity]] and Egyptians who remained Christian, though references to native Muslims as Copts are attested until the [[Mamluk]] period.<ref>C. Petry. "Copts in Late Medieval Egypt." ''Coptic Encylcopaedia''. 2:618 (1991).</ref>

*'''{{Unicode|Maṣreyyīn}}''' (مَصريين) – The modern Egyptian name comes from the ancient [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] name for Egypt and originally connoted "civilization" or "metropolis". [[Classical Arabic]] ''Mi{{Unicode|ṣ}}r'' ([[Egyptian Arabic]] ''Ma{{Unicode|ṣ}}r'') is directly cognate with the [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]] ''Mitzráyīm'', meaning "the two straits", a reference to the predynastic separation of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]. [[Edward William Lane]] writing in the 1820s, said that Egyptians commonly called themselves ''El-Ma{{Unicode|ṣ}}reeyeen'' 'the Egyptians', ''Owlad {{Unicode|Maṣr}}'' 'the Children of Egypt' and ''Ahl {{Unicode|Maṣr}}'' 'the People of Egypt'. He added that the [[Turkish people|Turks]] "stigmatized" the Egyptians with the name ''Ahl-Far'oon'' or the 'People of the Pharaoh'.<ref>Lane, Edward William. ''An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 2003. Rep. of 5th ed, 1860. pp. 26-27.</ref>

==Demographics and society==
{{See also|Demographics of Egypt}}

[[Image:Cairo orascom.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Modern superstructures juxtaposed with traditional housing along the ancient [[Nile]] river are part of today's landscape in Egypt's capital city.]]An estimated 76.4 million Egyptians live in the world, but the vast majority are in [[Egypt]] where they constitute about 94% (72.5 million) of the total population.<ref name="Ahram Weekly 1" /> Approximately 90% of Egyptians are Muslim and 10% are Christian (9% [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic]], 1% other Christian),<ref name="Factbook">Egypt. [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html#People The CIA World Factbook]. 2006.</ref> though estimates vary. Almost all live near the banks of the Nile River where the only arable land is found. Close to a half of the Egyptian people today are urban, living in the densely populated centres of greater [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]] and other major cities. Most of the rest are ''[[fellahin]]'' or farmers leading humble lives in rural towns and villages. A large influx of fellahin into urban towns and cities, and rapid urbanization of many rural areas since the turn of the last century, have shifted the balance between the number of urban and rural Egyptians. 

Egyptians also form smaller minorities in the countries that neighbour them, in particular [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Libya]] where they are mostly temporary professionals and workers, as well as in other countries as immigrants, notably in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and [[France]]. It is also a matter of dispute whether the [[Egyptians (Balkans)|Egyptian population]] of the [[Balkans|Balkan states]] are ethnic Egyptians. 

The Egyptians are an autochthonous people deeply attached to their land. Historically, it was rare for Egyptians to leave their country permanently or for an extended period of time—it was not until the 1970s that Egyptians began to emigrate in large numbers. Until only recently, a study on the pattern of Egyptian emigration was quoted as saying "Egyptians have a reputation of preferring their own soil. Few leave except to study or travel; and they always return... Egyptians do not emigrate."<ref>qtd. in Talani, p. 20</ref> Egyptians also tend to be provincial, meaning their attachment extends not only to Egypt but to the specific [[Governorates of Egypt|provinces]], towns and villages from which they hail. Therefore, return migrants, such as temporary workers abroad, come back to their region of origin in Egypt.

{{cquote|Their characteristic rootedness as Egyptians, commonly explained as the result of centuries as a farming people clinging to the banks of the Nile, is reflected in sights, sounds and atmosphere that are meaningful to all Egyptians. Dominating the intangible pull of Egypt is the ever present [[Nile]], which is more than a constant backdrop. Its varying colors and changing water levels signal the coming and going of the Nile flood that sets the rhythm of farming in a rainless country and holds the attention of all Egyptians. No Egyptian is ever far from his river and, except for the [[Alexandria|Alexandrines]] whose personality is split by looking outward toward the Mediterranean, the Egyptians are a hinterland people with little appetite for travel, even inside their own country. They glorify their national dishes, including the [[Ful Medames|variety of concoctions surrounding the simple bean]]. Most of all, they have a sense of all-encompassing familiarity at home and a sense of alienation when abroad... There is something particularly excruciating about Egyptian nostalgia for Egypt: it is sometimes outlandish, but the attachment flows through all Egyptians, as the Nile through Egypt.<ref>Wakin, Edward. A Lonely Minority. The Modern Story of Egypt's Copts. New York: William, Morrow & Company, 1963. pp. 30-31, 37.</ref>}}

A sizable Egyptian diaspora did not begin to form until well into the 1980s, today numbering nearly 4 million (2006 est).<ref name="Ahram Weekly 1" /> Generally, those who emigrate to the United States and western European countries tend to do so with the intention of settling permanently, while Egyptians migrating to neighboring countries in the Middle East only go there to work with the intention of returning to Egypt:

{{cquote|Only a reduced number of Egyptians, primarily professionals, had left the country in search for employment before 1974. Scholars identify three phases in the evolution of the Egyptian migratory flows... Coexisting political, demographic and economic pressures led to the first wave of international migration in post-revolutionary Egypt, which, however, interested only a very limited number of students and professionals... With the advent of the 1970s, Egyptian emigration changed in nature, size and destination. More Egyptians left their homeland and headed towards the rich oil-producing states, first after the 1973 boom in oil prices and again after the second increase in oil prices in 1979. However, it was only in the second half of the 1980s that Egyptian migration became a relevant phenomenon, entering its last phase of development... Two-thirds of Egyptian migration is temporary, while the other third is permanent... most [Egyptian emigrants] going to western European countries (55.5%) and almost all those who go to the US and Australia (93%) are permanent migrants. On the contrary, the whole sample of those going to Arab countries (100%) intends to go back to Egypt.<ref name="Talani" />}}

[[Image:Egyptian fellah.jpg|thumb|150px|Sixty percent of Egyptians are rural ''[[fellah]]in'' or farmers. The percentage was much higher at the turn of the last century, before rapid urbanization and large-scale in-migration shifted Egypt's demographics.]]Egyptian emigration is primarily motivated by economic and political considerations. High rates of unemployment and population growth are two of the socioeconomic conditions that steadily deteriorated following the 1952 [[coup d'état]], leading scores of Egyptians to seek better opportunities in foreign countries. Political repression and human rights violations by Egypt's ruling régime are other contributing factors (see [[Egypt#Human rights]]). Egyptians have also been impacted by the wars between Egypt and [[Israel]], particularly after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when migration rates began to rise. In August 2006, Egyptians made headlines when 11 students from [[Mansoura University]] failed to show up at their [[United States|American]] host institutions for a cultural exchange program in the hope of finding employment.<ref>Mitchell, Josh.

==Origins==  
{{see also|Egypt#Identity}}
[[Image:Rammumy.jpg|thumb|110px|left|Mummy of [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]] King [[Ramesses II]].]]Over the years, the findings of [[archaeology]], [[biological anthropology]] and [[population genetics]] have shed light on the origins of the Egyptians. The indigenous Nile Valley population became firmly established during the [[Pleistocene]] when nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s began living along the [[Nile]] river. Traces of these proto-Egyptians appear in the form of artifacts and rock carvings in the terraces of the Nile and the desert oases. Beginning in the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]], some differences between the populations of Upper and Lower Egypt were ascertained through their skeletal remains, suggesting a gradual [[Cline (population genetics)|clinal]] pattern north to south.<ref>Batrawi A (1945).

The southern pattern continues to predominate in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], Upper Egypt by the [[First dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], but "lower Egyptian, Maghrebian, and European patterns are observed also, thus making for great diversity."<ref>Keita 1992, p. 251</ref>
        
A 2006 [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] study on the dental morphology of ancient Egyptians by Prof. Joel Irish shows dental traits characteristic of indigenous [[North Africa]]ns and to a lesser extent [[Southwest Asia]]n populations. Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the [[commons:Fayum mummy portraits|Hawara tombs of Fayum]], which clustered very closely with the [[Badarian]] series of the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia. Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post-pharaonic periods. According to Irish:     
         
<blockquote>[The Egyptian] samples [996 mummies] exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced dentitions that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a–c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia and Europe (Turner, 1985a; Turner and Markowitz, 1990; Roler, 1992; Lipschultz, 1996; Irish, 1998a). Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well (Brace et al., 1993)... an inspection of MMD values reveals no evidence of increasing phenetic distance between samples from the first and second halves of this almost 3,000-year-long period. For example, phenetic distances between First-Second Dynasty Abydos and samples from Fourth Dynasty Saqqara (MMD ¼ 0.050), 11-12th Dynasty Thebes (0.000), 12th Dynasty Lisht (0.072), 19th Dynasty Qurneh (0.053), and 26th–30th Dynasty Giza (0.027) do not exhibit a directional increase through time... Thus, despite increasing foreign influence after the Second Intermediate Period, not only did Egyptian culture remain intact (Lloyd, 2000a), but the people themselves, as represented by the dental samples, appear biologically constant as well... Gebel Ramlah [Neolithic Nubian/Western Desert sample] is, in fact, significantly different from Badari based on the 22-trait MMD (Table 4). For that matter, the Neolithic Western Desert sample is significantly different from all others [but] is closest to predynastic and early dynastic samples.<ref>Irish pp. 10-11</ref></blockquote>     
         
[[Image:Egyptworkshop.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Egyptian students at a youth workshop.]]A group of noted physical anthropologists conducted craniofacial studies of Egyptian skeletal remains and concluded similarly that "the Egyptians have been in place since back in the Pleistocene and have been largely unaffected by either invasions or migrations. As others have noted, Egyptians are Egyptians, and they were so in the past as well."<ref>Brace et al. 1993 [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110532242/ABSTRACT]</ref>     
    
[[genetic genealogy|Genetic]] analysis of modern Egyptians reveals that they have [[Haplogroup#Y chromosome DNA haplogroups|paternal]] lineages common to indigenous North Africans/[[Berber people|Berber]] populations primarily, and to [[Near East]]ern peoples to a lesser extent — these lineages would have spread during the [[Neolithic]] and maintained by the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Arredi B, Poloni E, Paracchini S, Zerjal T, Fathallah D, Makrelouf M, Pascali V, Novelletto A, Tyler-Smith C | title=A predominantly neolithic origin for Y-chromosomal DNA variation in North Africa. | journal=Am J Hum Genet | volume=75 | issue=2 | pages=338-45 | year=2004 | id=PMID 15202071}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Manni F, Leonardi P, Barakat A, Rouba H, Heyer E, Klintschar M, McElreavey K, Quintana-Murci L | title=Y-chromosome analysis in Egypt suggests a genetic regional continuity in Northeastern Africa. | journal=Hum Biol | volume=74 | issue=5 | pages=645-58 | year=2002 | id=PMID 12495079}}</ref> Studies based on [[Haplogroup#Mitochondrial DNA haplogroups|maternal]] lineages also link Egyptians with people from modern [[Eritrea]]/[[Ethiopia]] such as the [[Tigre people|Tigre]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kivisild T, Reidla M, Metspalu E, Rosa A, Brehm A, Pennarun E, Parik J, Geberhiwot T, Usanga E, Villems R | title=Ethiopian mitochondrial DNA heritage: tracking gene flow across and around the gate of tears. | journal=Am J Hum Genet | volume=75 | issue=5 | pages=752-70 | year=2004 | id=PMID 15457403}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Stevanovitch A, Gilles A, Bouzaid E, Kefi R, Paris F, Gayraud R, Spadoni J, El-Chenawi F, Béraud-Colomb E | title=Mitochondrial DNA sequence diversity in a sedentary population from Egypt. | journal=Ann Hum Genet | volume=68 | issue=Pt 1 | pages=23-39 | year=2004 | id=PMID 14748828}}</ref>

[[University of Chicago]] Egyptologist Frank Yurco confirmed this finding of historical and regional continuity, saying:     
        
<blockquote>Certainly there was some foreign admixture [in Egypt], but basically a homogeneous African population had lived in the Nile Valley from ancient to modern times... [the] Badarian people, who developed the earliest Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since (Hassan 1985; Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990; Brace et al., this volume)... The peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of East Africa, Ethiopia and Somalia are now generally regarded as a Nilotic (i.e. Nile River) continuity, with widely ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and craniofacial types) but with powerful common cultural traits, including cattle pastoralist traditions (Trigger 1978; Bard, Snowden, this volume). Language research suggests that this Saharan-Nilotic population became speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages... Semitic was evidently spoken by Saharans who crossed the Red Sea into Arabia and became ancestors of the Semitic speakers there, possibly around 7000 BC... In summary we may say that Egypt was distinct North African culture rooted in the Nile Valley and on the Sahara.<ref>Frank Yurco, "An Egyptological Review" in Mary R.

Egyptians may have the longest continuous history of any people, spanning a period of some 7,000 years. The Egyptians' recorded history starts with the unification of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] ''c''. 3150 BC, an event that sparked the beginning of Egypt's [[Ancient Egypt|ancient civilization]]. A succession of thirty mostly native dynasties ruled for the next three [[Millennium|millennia]], during which Egyptian culture flourished and remained distinctively Egyptian in its [[Egyptian mythology|religion]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|arts]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and [[Ancient Egypt|customs]]. [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt in [[332 BC]], giving rise to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic dynasty]] which introduced [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] culture to the Egyptians, but continued to rule according to ancient Egyptian traditions. This stability shifted when the Egyptians fell under [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Roman]] rule, most notably with the introduction of [[Coptic Christianity|Christianity]] in Egypt by [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] in the [[1st century]]. The Egyptians were soon incorporated within the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] fold and remained so until the [[7th century]], when Egypt became part of the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt|Islamic Caliphate]] following [[Amr ibn al-A'as|Amr ibn al-As]]'s conquest that brought [[Islam]] to Egypt. Egyptians were ruled by a succession of [[Arabs]], [[Mamluk]] [[Circassians]], [[Ottoman Turks]] and [[English people|British]] until independence was reasserted in 1922 and a republic was declared in 1953. 

===Prehistory===

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] findings show that primitive tribes lived along the Nile long before the [[Ancient Egypt|dynastic history]] of the [[Pharaoh]]s began. By about 5500 BC, Egypt was inhabited by settled communities of people who cultivated emmer wheat and barley, made pottery, weaved linen and raised sheep, goats and cattle. Before the unification of [[Lower and Upper Egypt]], northern Egyptians seem to have been somewhat culturally distinct from their neighbors to the south. Surviving evidence for early settlement in Lower Egypt such as pottery, houses and burial sites appear different from those of the Upper Egyptians. The earliest known predynastic northern Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the earliest in Upper Egypt, the [[Badarian]], by about 700 years.<ref>Watterson, Barbara. ''The Egyptians''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. 1997. p. 30.</ref> However, later predynastic Lower Egyptians were in contact with not only contemporaneous southern Egyptians, but also with people from the [[Levant]] and with the [[Sumerians]] of [[Uruk]], as some of the plants cultivated and the pottery types found in Lower Egypt resemble those of neighboring cultures.<ref>Midant-Reynes, Béatrix. ''The Prehistory of Egypt: From the First Egyptians to the First Pharaohs''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. 2000. p. 219.</ref> 

Prehistoric Lower Egyptians already believed in an existence after death, as attested by their grave goods.<ref>Watterson, p. 30.</ref> Each province before the unification of Egypt acquired its own animal deity. [[Wadjet|Uto]] and [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]] were worshipped in the [[Nile delta|delta]] towns of [[Buto]] and [[Bubastis]] respectively, while [[Thoth]] and [[Wepwawet]] were the Upper Egyptian deities of [[Hermopolis|Ashmounein]] and [[Asyut]]. The predynastic settlements of Upper Egypt displayed more elaborate funerary practices and artifacts that were more clearly the direct predecessors of those of the dynastic Egyptians. Significantly, the earliest known evidence of [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]ic inscriptions appears on [[Naqada]] III pottery vessels dated to about 3200 BC.<ref>Bard, Kathryn A. Ian Shaw, ed. ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Ancient Egypt''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. p. 69.</ref> During the predynastic and [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt|protodynastic]] periods, the southern Egyptian cities of [[Nekheb]], [[Nekhen]] (Hierakonpolis) and [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] were major centers of power. The first attempt to conquer Lower Egypt seems to have been made by a king from Nekhen known as Scorpion, but it would be another 100 years or so before another upper Egyptian king successfully unified the two lands.<ref>Watterson, p. 42</ref>

===Dynastic period===
{{main|Ancient Egypt|History of Ancient Egypt}}

[[Image:NarmerPalette-ROM-back.jpg|thumb|right|130px|The [[Narmer Palette]] believed to depict the unification of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]].]]The beginning of the Egyptians' recorded history starts with the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt by the Upper Egyptian king [[Narmer]] (identified with the pharaoh [[Menes]]). He founded [[Ancient Egypt]]'s [[First dynasty of Egypt|1st dynasty]] around 3150 BC. To strengthen his political role, King Menes/Narmer married the northern Egyptian princess Neithotep and took on the title of [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary#The Nebty (Two Ladies) Name|Two Ladies]], i.e., [[Nekhbet]], the vulture goddess of Upper Egypt and [[Wadjet|Uto]] the cobra goddess worshipped by the Lower Egyptians, as a symbol of the unification. [[Herodotus]], like the Egyptian historian [[Manetho]], associated the unification with King Menes. He also indicated that Menes founded the ancient city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in Lower Egypt, which became the new capital of the unified country. The Egyptians from this point onwards referred to the country as ''tAwy'', Two Lands, a name that came to predominate until the [[New Kingdom]] period when the name ''km.t'' ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]: ''kīmi''), Black Land, was more commonly used. The first two dynasties of Egypt were each ruled by eight kings and lasted for a combined period of nearly 400 years.

====Old Kingdom====

{{main|Old Kingdom}}

By the end of the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic period]], a strong centralized government was firmly established with Memphis as its capital city, and the foundations of the first peak period of Egyptian civilization were laid. The following era in Egyptian history, the [[Old Kingdom]] (''c''. 2700−2200 BC), is particularly famous for its magnificent superstructures, many of which served as royal tombs for the pharaohs. They were state-sponsored projects built in the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|3rd]] and [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th]] dynasties and in which the whole of the Egyptian population often participated. Building typically commenced during the Nile's Inundation when agricultural lands were submerged in water and people could not farm. King [[Djoser]]'s [[Pyramid of Djoser|step pyramid]] at [[Saqqara]], engineered by the famous architect and physician [[Imhotep]], and the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza pyramids]] are among this period's most famous examples. They are a testament to the Egyptians' extraordinary competence in astronomy and mathematics very early in their history. It is believed that many parts of famous medical papyri that appear in later periods, particularly the [[Edwin Smith papyrus]], were written during this period by Imhotep and other Egyptian doctors.<ref>Nunn, John F. ''Ancient Egyptian Medicine''. University of Oklahoma Press, 1996. p. 11</ref>

[[Image:EgyptianScribe.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Seated statue of a scribe, [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|5th dynasty]].]]Egyptian [[Egyptian mythology|religion]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|writing]] took definitive shape in the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. The local pantheon, which had been in the predynastic period confined to sacred animal deities, expanded to include cosmic gods representing the sun, moon, sky and wind. This constituted an effort toward greater philosophical and intellectual development.<ref>Watterson, p. 65</ref> Solar worship embodied in the cults of [[Ra]] and [[Atum]]—subsequently Atum-Ra—came to particular prominence in the Old Kingdom. Other important deities during this period were [[Hathor]], [[Ptah]] and [[Horus]]. The art of [[Mummy|mummification]] was also honed before the end of this period. The oldest known mummy dates to the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|5th dynasty]] and was found in Saqqara.<ref>Watterson p. 69</ref> Lasting for an estimated 500 years, the Old Kingdom was the quintessential Egyptian civilization. Insular and unchallenged from abroad, the Egyptians enjoyed a time of continuous prosperity and stability unmatched by any other period, leading one historian to describe it as the "Peaceable Kingdom of historical memory."<ref>Jankowski, James. ''Egypt: A Short History''. Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2000. p. 5</ref>

{{main|Middle Kingdom of Egypt}}

A period of political fragmentation led to the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]]. It lasted for about 150 years during which central authority and social order were maintained by local governors. Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] ''c''. 2040 BC, reaching a peak during the reign of [[Amenemhat III]]. [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (modern [[Luxor]]) became the new capital during the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|11th dysnaty]], though government administration remained in Memphis. Egyptians regularly traded with their neighbors to the south and east, and their political influence extended into those areas. However, land cultivation and stock raising remained the foundation of Egypt's economy, as they would during the course of Egyptian history. The state did not institute a system of coinage until the [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Period]]—most business hitherto was conducted by barter.<ref>Watterson, p. 62</ref> The Middle Kingdom became a golden age of Egyptian literature thanks to a large body of textual evidence that made this stage of [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] (i.e., Middle Egyptian) the classical phase of the language.

The end of the Middle Kingdom was brought about by a decline in central authority which led to Egypt being occupied for the first time during its dynastic history. The [[Hyksos]] invaders were a [[Semitic]] people who took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC, and founded a new capital at [[Avaris]]. They ruled as Egyptian pharaohs and their names were often inscribed on scarabs bearing both the their Semitic and Egyptian titles. Hyksos rule lasted just over 100 years when they were eventually driven out by the native Egyptian nobleman [[Ahmose I]]. Despite the Hyksos' attempt to rule according to native Egyptian traditions, the Egyptians' perception of them was consistently negative. They were depicted as "uncouth barbarians who 'ruled without Re.'"<ref>Jankowski, p. 6</ref> Ahmose took to the throne in a re-unified Egypt, and with his rule began a period of Egyptian independence as well as expansion into surrounding regions.

====New Kingdom====

{{main|New Kingdom}}

The [[New Kingdom]] is perhaps the most celebrated period of Egyptian history. Lasting from roughly 1550 to 1070 BC, the period marked the rise of Egypt as an international power. Ahmose founded the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] and relocated the capital to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], though once again Memphis remained the administrative capital. The Egyptians emerged from the shock of the Hyksos invasion determined to protect Egypt's national and territorial integrity. The Egyptian army developed into a well-organized service made up of professionally trained soldiers. International relations became a primary concern for the New Kingdom pharaohs. Egyptians were introduced to many foreign ideas, some of which they adopted and incorporated into their lifestyle. As in most periods, agriculture and stock farming continued to be the mainstays of Egyptian economy. The introduction of the [[shaduf]] from western Asia helped develop more efficient methods of irrigation. [[Amun]] rose to become a state god and was [[syncretism|syncretized]] with Ra as Amun-Ra. The main [[Precinct of Amon-Re|Temple of Amun]] built in Thebes is the largest structure in the [[Karnak]] complex.

Perhaps this period is best known for some of its rulers. Queen [[Hatshepsut]] was one of only a few Egyptian female rulers and their most influential. She sent trade missions as far south as the coast of modern [[Eritrea]], and her numerous building projects, most notably her [[mortuary temple]] complex at [[Deir el-Bahri]], were rivaled only by those of her Old Kingdom predecessors. [[Thutmose III]], dubbed the Napoleon of Egypt, pushed Egypt's southern frontier to the Fourth Cataract in [[Nubia]], then conquered and subsequently founded protectorates in the [[Levant]]. He undertook a building program at Karnak, including the festival temple "Effective of Monuments" in the precinct of Amun.<ref>Besty M. Bryan. ''18th Dynasty before the Amarna Period (''c''. 1550-1352 BC)'' in Shaw, p. 259</ref> [[Akhenaten]] with his wife [[Nefertiti]] revolutionized Egyptian religion, albeit briefly, with the solar [[monotheism]] of [[Aten]]. Young King [[Tutankhamun]] is world famous for his magnificent tomb found intact. [[Ramesses II]] conducted many successful military campaigns and signed what may be the world's first peace treaty.<ref>Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. 1997. p. 257</ref> He constructed many impressive monuments, including the renowned archaeological complex of [[Abu Simbel]] and the memorial temple of [[Ramesseum]]. [[Ramesses III]] was the last of the great pharaohs of the New Kingdom, under whose rule Egypt reached a peak of prosperity.<ref>Watterson, p. 123</ref>

====Late period====
[[Image:Nectanebo2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|King [[Nectanebo II]] was Egypt's last native Pharaoh, 360 − 343 BC.]]
{{main|Late Period of ancient Egypt}}

When the New Kingdom came to an end, the priests of Amun and the military had become powerful and independent at the expense of the throne. By 1200 BC, Egypt was under repeated attacks by [[Berber people|Libyans]] from the west and invaders from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region referred to as the [[Sea Peoples]]. The country fell into the chaos of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] during which authority was divided among several competing [[nomarch]]s. The 22nd through the 25th dynasties were made up entirely of Libyan and [[Nubia]]n/[[Kush]]ite rulers. The [[Assyria]]ns invaded and took of control of Egypt in the 7th century BC, but soon a native Egyptian dynasty drove out the Assyrians and reclaimed the throne. The [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]] began the Saïte period which witnessed another period of Egyptian independence as well as a cultural revival. The first Saïte king, [[Psammetichus I|Psamtek I]], founded a new capital at [[Sais, Egypt|Saïs]] and reunified upper and lower Egypt. Egyptians looked at the Old Kingdom, by then a 2000-year-old civilization, for inspiration in their artistic and religious expression to cope with the repeated foreign assaults on their country at the close of the Pharaonic era.

====Society====
[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Farm scene from the burial chamber of Sennedjem, reign of [[Ramesses II]], ''c''. 1279–1213 BC.]]

Throughout the Pharaonic epoch, divine kingship was the glue which held Egyptian society together. It was especially pronounced in the Old and Middle Kingdoms and continued until the Roman conquest. The societal structure created by this system of government remained virtually unchanged up to modern times.<ref>Grimal, p. 93</ref> The role of the king, however, was considerably weakened after the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]]. The king in his role as Son of Ra was entrusted to maintain [[Ma'at#Ma'at as a principle|Ma'at]], the principle of truth, justice and order. His job also entailed maintaining and enhancing the country's agricultural economy by ensuring regular annual [[Nile]] floods on which the people depended for sustenance and their very livelihood. Ascendancy to the Egyptian throne reflected the myth of Horus who assumed kingship after he buried his murdered father [[Osiris]]. The king of Egypt, as a living personification of Horus, could claim the throne after burying his predecessor, who was typically his father. When the role of the king waned, the country became more susceptible to foreign influence and invasion.

[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer der Bildhauer Nebamun und Ipuki 005.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Boat scene, tomb of Nebamun, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], Thebes.]]

The attention paid to the dead, and the veneration with which they were held, were one of the hallmarks of ancient Egyptian society. Egyptians built tombs for their dead that were meant to last for eternity. This was most prominently expressed by the Great Pyramids. The ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for tomb ''pr n{{Unicode|ɦɦ}}'' means 'House of Eternity.' The Egyptians also celebrated life and this is attested by tomb reliefs and inscriptions, papyri and other sources depicting Egyptians farming, conducting trade expeditions, hunting, holding festivals, attending parties and receptions with their pet dogs, cats and monkeys, dancing and singing, enjoying food and drink, and playing games. The ancient Egyptians were also known for their engaging sense of humor, much like their modern descendants.<ref>Watterson, p. 15</ref>

Another important continuity during this period is the Egyptian attitude toward foreigners—those they considered not fortunate enough to be part of the community of ''rmṯ'' or "the people" (i.e., Egyptians.) This attitude was facilitated by the Egyptians' more frequent contact with other peoples during the New Kingdom, when Egypt expanded to an empire that also encompassed [[Nubia]] through [[Jebel Barkal]] and parts of the [[Levant]]. The Egyptian sense of superiority was given religious validation, as foreigners in the land of ''Ta-Meri'' (Egypt) were anathema to the maintenance of Maat—a view most clearly expressed by the [[Ipuwer papyrus|admonitions of Ipuwer]] in reaction to the chaotic events of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]. Foreigners in Egyptian texts were described in derogatory terms; e.g., 'wretched Asiatics' (Semites), 'vile Kushites' (Nubians), and 'Ionian dogs' (Greeks). Egyptian beliefs remained unchallenged when Egypt fell to the [[Hyksos]], [[Assyria]]ns, [[Berber people|Libyans]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Greeks]]—their rulers assumed the role of the Egyptian Pharaoh and were often depicted praying to Egyptian gods.

[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer des Antefoker 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Wall painting from tomb of Antefoker depicting dancing Egyptians, [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], ''c''. 1950 BC.]]

The ancient Egyptians used a solar calendar that divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each, with five extra days added. As with nearly every other aspect of Egyptian society, the calendar revolved around the annual [[Nile]] Inundation (''akh.t''), the first of three seasons into which the year was divided. The other two were Winter and Summer, each lasting for four months. The modern Egyptian ''[[fellah]]in'' calculate the agricultrual seasons, with the months still bearing their ancient names, in much the same manner. The importance of the Nile in Egyptian life, ancient and modern, cannot be overemphasized. The rich alluvium carried by the Nile inundation were the basis of Egypt's formation as a society and a state. Regular inundations were a cause for celebration; low waters often meant famine and starvation. The ancient Egyptians personified the river flood as the god [[Hapy]] and dedicated a ''Hymn to the Nile'' to celebrate it. ''km.t'', the Black Land, was as [[Herodotus]] observed, "the gift of the river."

===Nubian Rule period===
Kush invaded and controlled Egypt itself for a period (the Ethiopian dynasty). They held sway over their northern neighbors for nearly 100 years. The Nubian kingdom to the south took full advantage of this division and political instability. Prior to Piye's Year 20 campaign into Egypt, the previous Nubian ruler – Kashta – had already extended his kingdom's influence over into Thebes when he compelled Shepenupet, the serving Divine Adoratice of Amun and Takelot III's sister, to adopt his own daughter Amenirdis, to be her successor. Then, 20 years later, around 732 BC his successor, Piye, marched North and defeated the combined might of several native Egyptian rulers such as Peftjaubast, Osorkon IV of Tanis, and Tefnakht of Sais. Piye established the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty and appionted the defeated rulers as his provincial governors. He was succeeded first by his brother, Shabaka, and then by his two sons Shebitku and Taharqa.Eventually the Kushites were defeated by the invading Assyrians. They retreated further south and established their capital at Meroë.

===Persian Achaemenid period===
{{main|History of Egypt under Achaemenid Persian domination}}

Soon Egypt fell to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] led by [[Cambyses]] in 525 BC, marking more than a century of Persian rule. Constant revolting by Egyptians through the 5th century BC culminated in the Egyptians reasserting their independence briefly under [[Amyrtaeus]], who led a revolt from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] and took control of Memphis and Upper Egypt.<ref>Watterson, p. 181</ref> Egyptians remained independent until the reign of King [[Nectanebo II]], who was to be the last native ruler of pharaonic Egypt. The country prospered during his reign (360−343 BC) and he undertook large building and sculpture construction comparable to those of the Saïte period.<ref>Watterson, p. 182</ref> The Persians under [[Artaxerxes III of Persia|Artaxerxes III]] dealt a final blow to the Egyptians' independence when they reconquered Egypt in 343 BC. [[Alexander the Great]], on his way to conquer and dismantle the [[Persian Empire]], arrived in Egypt in 332 BC. After Alexander's death, the Greek Macedonian [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] was established by one of his generals, which continued to rule the country along pharaonic traditions. Alexander founded the city of [[Alexandria]] which became the new capital of Egypt until the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. When the last and most famous of the Ptolemies, Queen [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII]], was defeated along with [[Mark Antony]] by the Roman Emperor [[Augustus|Octavian]] in the [[Battle of Actium]], it marked the end of 3000 years of Dynastic Egyptian history.

===Graeco-Roman period===

[[Image:CleopatraVII.jpg|thumb|right|140px|An Egyptian-style black basalt statue of Ptolemaic Queen [[Cleopatra VII]], ''c''. 51 − 30 B.C.]]
When Alexander died, a story began to circulate that Nectanebo II, the last indigenous monarch, was Alexander's father. This made Alexander in the eyes of the Egyptians a legitimate heir to the native pharaohs.<ref>Watterson, p. 192</ref> Alexander may have been hailed as a liberator for freeing Egypt from [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid rule]], but his [[Macedon]]ian successors, however, did not live up to his legacy as they proved to be no better than the previous [[History of Egypt under Achaemenid Persian domination|Persian rulers in Egypt]]. The Ptolemies exploited Egypt for their own benefit and a great social divide was created whereby Egyptians were reduced to second-class citizens.<ref>Kamil, Jill. ''Coptic Egypt: History and Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 1997. p. 11</ref> Frequent revolting by the Egyptians against the Greeks took place under [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] (205 − 180 BC),  whose coronation had earlier been commemorated by erecting a [[stele]] inscribed in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] as well as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]. When the stele was discovered by the [[French people|French]] in the 19th century, it came to be known as the [[Rosetta Stone]] and was key to deciphering hieroglyphs.

But while Egyptians lost their national independence to the Macedonian Greeks, the priesthood continued to wield power as they had during the dynastic age. Under the Ptolemies, Egyptians practiced their religion undisturbed and largely maintained their own separate communities from their foreign conquerors.<ref>Watterson, p. 215</ref> The Ptolemaic rulers all retained their Greek names and titles, but projected a public image of being Egyptian pharaohs. Much of this period's vernacular literature was composed in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] phase and script of the Egyptian language. It was focused on earlier stages of Egyptian history when Egyptians were independent and ruled by those they viewed as great native pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]]. Many prophetic writings circulated among Egyptians promising expulsion of the Greeks.<ref>Kamil, p. 12</ref> The language of administration became [[Greek language|Greek]], but the mass of the Egyptian population was [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]-speaking and concentrated in the countryside, while most Greeks lived in Alexandria and only few had any knowledge of Egyptian.<ref>Jankowski, p. 28</ref> A revival in animal cults, the hallmark of the Predyanstic and Early Dyanstic periods, is said to have come about as Egyptians became increasingly disillusioned and sickened by successive waves of foreign invasions. Feeling a spiritual void, the Egyptians turned to the most characteristic feature of their ancient religion, the worship of sacred animals which were mummified after death.<ref>Watterson, p. 214</ref>

[[Image:Fayum-01.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Roman-era portrait of an Egyptian man from the [[commons:Fayum mummy portraits|Fayum tomb collection]], ''c.'' AD 125 − AD 150]]
When the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s annexed Egypt in 30 BC, the social structure created by the Greeks was largely retained, though the power of the Egyptian priesthood diminished. The Roman emperors lived abroad and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship as the Ptolemies had. Egypt became further stratified with Romans at the apex of the social pyramid, [[Greek people|Greeks]] and [[Jews]] in the middle, and Egyptians, who constituted the vast majority, at the bottom. At one point, the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] advocated the expulsion of all ethnic Egyptians from the city of Alexandria, saying "genuine Egyptians can easily be recognized among the linen-weavers by their speech."<ref>qtd. in Alan K. Bowman ''Egypt after the Pharaohs, 332 BC − AD 642''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996. p. 126.</ref> This attitude lasted until AD [[212]] when Roman citizenship was granted to all the inhabitants of Egypt, though ethnic divisions remained largely entrenched.<ref>Jankowski, p. 29</ref> The Romans, like the Ptolemies had before them, treated Egypt like their own private property, a land exploited for the benefit of a small foreign elite. The Egyptian peasants, pressed for maximum production to meet Roman quotas, suffered greatly and many fled as a result to the desert.<ref>Kamil, p. 16</ref> Under Roman rule, Egyptians paid a poll tax at full rate, Greeks paid at half-rate and Roman citizens were exempt.<ref>Watterson, p. 237</ref> While Egypt largely retained its integrity and had a stable economy during Ptolemaic rule, it was reduced to an impoverished country cut off from its identity under Roman occupation.

===Byzantine and Coptic Christian period===
[[Image:AnkhCross.gif|thumb|150px|A typical example of early Coptic art reflecting a blend of Egyptian and Christian elements, as the [[ankh]] was "Christianized" into the Coptic cross.]] The cult of [[Isis]], like those of [[Osiris]] and [[Serapis]], had been popular in Egypt and throughout the [[Roman Empire]] at the coming of Christianity, and continued to be the main competitor with Christianity in its early years. The main temple of Isis remained a major center of worship in Egypt until the reign of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]] in the [[6th century]], when it was finally closed down. Egyptians, disaffected and weary after a series of foreign occupations, identified the story of the mother-goddess Isis protecting her child [[Horus]] with that of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and her son [[Jesus]] escaping the emperor [[Herod the Great|Herod]].<ref>Kamil, p. 21</ref> Consequently, many sites believed to have been the resting places of the holy family during their sojourn in Egypt became sacred to the Egyptians. The visit of the holy family later circulated among Egyptian Christians as fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1). The feast of the coming of the Lord of Egypt on June 1 became an important part of Christian Egyptian tradition. According to tradition, Christianity was brought to Egypt by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the early 40s of the [[1st century]], under the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]]. The earliest converts were Jews residing in [[Alexandria]], a city which had by then become a center of culture and learning in the entire Mediterranean ''[[oikoumene]]''. 

[[Image:Menas.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Christ and [[Saint Mina]] depicted in a 6th-century icon bearing [[Coptic language|Coptic]] writing from the Monastery of Saint Mina in Egypt. The icon is one of the oldest in the world.]] St. Mark is said to have founded the Holy Apostolic See of Alexandria and to have become its first [[List of Coptic Popes|Patriarch]]. Within 50 years of St. Mark's arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of [[New Testament]] writings appeared in [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of [[Decius]]. Christianity was tolerated in the Roman Empire until AD 284, when the Emperor [[Diocletian]] persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians. This event became a watershed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic Church]]. It became known as the 'Era of the Martyrs' and is commemorated in the [[Coptic calendar]] in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian's reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief. The practice precipitated the rise of [[monasticism]], for which the Egyptians, namely [[Anthony the Great|St. Antony]], [[Pachomius|St. Bakhum]], [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|St. Shenouda]] and [[Saint Amun|St. Amun]], are credited as pioneers. By the end of the [[4th century]], it is estimated that the mass of the Egyptians had either embraced Christianity or were nominally Christian.<ref>Jankowski, p. 32</ref>

The Catechetical School of Alexandria was founded in the [[3rd century]] by [[Pantaenus]], becoming a major school of Christian learning as well as science, mathematics and the humanities. The [[Psalms]] and part of the New Testament were translated at the school from Greek to Egyptian, which had already begun to be written in Greek letters with the addition of a number of demotic characters. This stage of the Egyptian language would later come to be known as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] along with its [[Coptic alphabet|alphabet]]. The third theologian to head the Catachetical School was a native Egyptian by the name of [[Origen]]. Origen was an outstanding theologian and one of the most influential [[Church Fathers]]. He traveled extensively to lecture in various churches around the world and has many important texts to his credit including the ''[[Hexapla]]'', an [[exegesis]] of various translations of the [[Old Testament|Hebrew Bible]]. 

[[Image:Coptic manuscript.jpg|thumb|270px|Coptic-Arabic manuscript, [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period, AD 1249-50. Images depict [[Jesus]] in the Garden of Gethsemene, the kiss of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], the arrest of Christ, his appearance before [[Caiaphas]], Peter's denial at cockcrow, Christ before [[Pilate]], and the baptism of Jesus in the [[Jordan River]].]]At the threshold of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the New Testament had been entirely translated into Coptic. But while Christianity continued to thrive in Egypt, the old pagan beliefs which had survived the test of time were facing mounting pressure. The Byzantine period was particularly brutal in its zeal to erase any traces of ancient Egyptian religion. Under emperor [[Theodosius I]], Christianity had already been proclaimed the religion of the Empire and all pagan cults were forbidden. When Egypt fell under the jurisdiction of [[Constantinople]] after the split of the Roman Empire, many ancient Egyptians temples were either destroyed or converted into monasteries.<ref>Kamil, p. 35</ref>

One of the defining moments in the history of the Church in Egypt is a controversy that ensued over the nature of Jesus Christ which culminated in the final split of the Coptic Church from both the Byzantine and Roman Catholic Churches. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] convened in AD 451, signaling the Byzantine Empire's determination to assert its hegemony over Egypt. When it declared that Jesus Christ was of two natures embodied in Christ's person, the Egyptian reaction was swift, rejecting the decrees of the Council as incompatible with the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] doctrine of Coptic Orthodoxy. The Copts' upholding of the Miaphysite doctrine against the pro-Chalcedonian Greek [[Melkite]]s had both theological and national implications. As Coptologist Jill Kamil notes, the position taken by the Egyptians "paved [the way] for the Coptic church to establish itself as a separate entity...No longer even spiritually linked with Constantinople, theologians began to write more in Coptic and less in Greek.

===Arabic and Islamic period===

[[Image:IbnTulunMosque.gif|thumb|180px|[[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] built during the [[Abbasid]] period between AD 876-79 in the old city of [[Fustat]], now Old Cairo.]]The [[Islam]]ic tradition in Egypt, similar to its Christian predecessor, traces its history to an earlier encounter with the new faith. It begins with Muhammad's union with the Egyptian lady Maria (subsequently 'Mother of the Believers')—an event believed by Egyptian Muslims as having led Muhammad to draft and sign a document ensuring the protection of the Copts when the Arabs conquered Egypt.<ref>Egypt State Information Service. [http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Pub/magazin/winter2003/110225000000000008.htm St. Catherine's Monastery]. Egypt Magazine. Winter 2003</ref> Later, the story of the Muslim wresting of Egypt from the Byzantines would circulate among Muslim Egyptians as having been foretold in the [[Qur'an|Quranic]] injunction, "Come into Egypt safely, as God wills it" (Yusuf 12:99). Egyptians were known to the [[Arab]]s as Copts—a word believed to be a corruption of the Greek ''Aiguptios'' (Egyptian). Hence, throughout the early Islamic period, Egyptians in Arabic texts were often referred to as [[Copts]] (qib{{Unicode|ṭ}} or qub{{Unicode|ṭ}}), who continued in the majority to be Christian and [[Coptic language|Coptic]]-speaking for centuries, though in the early years it also applied to the native community that had embraced Islam.

Just before the Arab conquest, the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] was able to reclaim Egypt after a brief Persian invasion in AD 616. He subsequently appointed [[Cyrus of Alexandria]], a Chalcedonian, as Patriarch. Cyrus was determined to convert the Egyptian Miaphysites by any means. He expelled Coptic monks and bishops from their monasteries and sees. Many died in the chaos, and the resentment of the Egyptians against their Byzantine conquerors reached a peak.<ref>Watterson, p. 232</ref> Meanwhile, the new religion of [[Islam]] was making headway in [[Arabia]], culminating in the [[Muslim conquests]] that took place following [[Muhammad]]'s death. In AD 639, the [[Arab]] general [[Amr ibn al-A'as|Amr ibn al-'As]] marched into Egypt, facing off with the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Heliopolis]] that ended with the Byzantines' defeat. The relationship between the Greek Melkites and the Egyptian Copts had grown so bitter that many Egyptians hailed the Arabs as liberators from Byzantine tyranny,<ref>Watterson, p. 232</ref><ref>Kamil, p. 40</ref> ironically much as they had done nearly a thousand years earlier when their ancestors welcomed the Macedonian [[Greeks]] to free them from the [[Persian people|Persians]]. 

The Arabs moved the capital from Alexandria to [[Fustat]] and, through the 7th century, they retained the existing Byzantine administrative structure with [[Greek language|Greek]] as the language of government, the ranks of which were filled by native Egyptians. Egyptians continued to worship freely so long as they paid the [[jizya]] poll tax levied by the Arabs, and the authority of the Miaphysite doctrine of the Coptic Church was nationally recognized. It was not long, however, before the relationship between the Egyptians and their Arab conquerors began to deteriorate. Initially, many Egyptians readily embraced Islam in the wake of the bitter conflict that ensued between the Coptic and Byzantine Churches. But soon, increased taxation by the Arabs became heavier, leading many Christians to adopt Islam in order to escape the jizya in addition to a land tax that had also been imposed on all Egyptians.<ref>Watterson, p. 268</ref> According to [[Ya'qubi|al-Ya'qubi]], repeated revolts by Egyptian Christians against the Arabs took place in the 8th and 9th centuries under the reign of the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s. The greatest was one in which disaffected Muslim Egyptians joined their Christian compatriots around AD 830 in an unsuccessful attempt to repel the Arabs.<ref>Watterson, p. 268</ref> The Egyptian Muslim historian Ibn Abd al-Hakam spoke harshly of the Abbasids—a reaction that according to Egyptologist Okasha El-Daly can be seen "within the context of the struggle between proud native Egyptians and the central Abbasid caliphate in Iraq."<ref>El-Daly, Okasha. ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium''. London: UCL Press, 2005. p. 165</ref>

[[Image:Dhulnun tomb.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Tomb of Egyptian saint [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (AD 796-859) in Cairo's [[City of the dead|City of the Dead]].]]The form of Islam that eventually took hold in Egypt was [[Sunni]], though very early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity. Just as Egyptians had been pioneers in early [[monasticism]] so they were in the development of the mystical form of Islam, [[Sufism]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 140</ref> Various Sufi [[tariqa|orders]] were founded in the [[8th century]] and flourished until the present day. One of the earliest Egyptian Sufis was [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (i.e., Dhul-Nun the Egyptian). He was born in [[Akhmim]] in AD 796 and achieved political and social leadership over the Egyptian people.<ref>Vatikiotis, P.J. ''The History of Modern Egypt''. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. p. 26</ref> Dhul-Nun was regarded as the Patron Saint of the Physicians and is credited with having introduced the concept of [[Gnosis]] into Islam, as well as of being able to decipher a number of hieroglyphic characters due to his knowledge of [[Coptic language|Coptic]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 164</ref> He was keenly interested in ancient Egyptian sciences, and claimed to have received his knowledge of alchemy from Egyptian sources.<ref>El-Daly, p. 112</ref> By the end of the 9th century, Islam appears to have become predominant among Egyptians.<ref>Kamil, p. 41</ref>

[[Image:Egypt.LuxorTemple.04.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Mosque of Abu Haggag]] built in the 11th century over the ruins of a pharaonic temple. The ancient Opet festival associated with this temple is mirrored in the present day festival of Abu-l Haggag celebrated similarly by boat processions through the streets of [[Luxor]].<ref>[http://www.hethert.org/opetfestival.htm Opet Festival]</ref>]] In the years to follow the Arab occupation of Egypt, a social hierarchy was created whereby Egyptians who converted to Islam acquired the status of [[mawali]] or "clients" to the ruling Arab elite, while those who remained Christian, the Copts, became [[dhimmis]]. In time, however, the power of the Arabs waned throughout the [[Islamic Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] so that in the 10th century, the Turkish [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshid]]s were able to take control of Egypt and made it an independent political unit from the rest of the empire. Egyptians continued to live socially and politically separate from their foreign conquerors, but their rulers like the Ptolemies before them were able to stabilize the country and bring renewed economic prosperity. It was under the [[Shi'a Islam|Shiite]] [[Fatimid]]s from the 10th to the 12th centuries that Muslim Egyptian institutions began to take form along with the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]] of Arabic, which was to eventually supplant native Egyptian or Coptic as the spoken language. [[Al-Azhar]] was founded in AD 970 in the new capital [[Cairo]], not very far from its ancient predecessor in Memphis. It became the preeminent Muslim center of learning in Egypt and by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period it had acquired a Sunni orientation. The Fatimids with some exceptions were known for their religious tolerance and their observance of local Muslim, Coptic and indigenous Egyptian festivals and customs. Under the Ayyubids, the country for the most part continued to prosper until it fell to the [[Mamluk]]s. 

The Mamluk period (AD 1258-1517) is generally regarded as one under which Egyptians, Muslims and Copts, greatly suffered. Copts were forcibly converted to Islam in greater numbers following the [[Crusade]]r assaults on Egypt. By the 15th century most Egyptians had already been converted to Islam, while Coptic Christians were reduced to a minority.<ref>Janjowski, p. 35</ref> The Mamluks were mainly ethnic [[Circassians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] who had been captured as slaves then recruited into the army fighting on behalf of the Islamic empire. Native Egyptians were not allowed to serve in the army until the reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]]. Historian James Jankwoski writes:

{{cquote|Ultimately, Mamluk rule rested on force. The chronicles of the period are replete with examples of Mamluk violence against the indigenous population of Egypt...From horseback, they simply terrorized those lesser breeds who crossed their paths. The sudden and arbitrary use of force by the government and its dominant military elite; frequent resort to cruelty to make a point; ingenious methods of torture employed both for exemplary purpose and to extract wealth from others: all these measures were routine in the Mamluk era. Egypt under the Mamluks was not a very secure place to live.<ref>''A Short History of Egypt'', p. 47</ref>}}

[[Image:GD-EG-Caire-Suhaymi033.JPG|thumb|180px|left|The House of Seheimy, a 17th-century Ottoman-style mansion in Old Cairo built over the course of two centuries.]]Egyptians under the [[Ottoman Turks]] from the 16th to the 18th centuries lived within a social hierarchy similar to that of the Mamluks, Arabs, Romans, Greeks and Persians before them. Native Egyptians applied the term ''atrak'' ([[Turkish people|Turks]]) indiscriminately to the Ottomans and Mamluks, who were at the top of the social pyramid, while Egyptians, most of whom were farmers, were at the bottom. Frequent revolts by the Egyptian peasantry against the Ottoman-Mamluk [[Bey]]s took place throughout the 18th century, particularly in Upper Egypt where the peasants at one point wrested control of the region and declared a separatist government.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 31</ref> The only segment of Egyptian society which appears to have retained a degree of power during this period were the Muslim '''ulama'' or religious scholars, who directed the religious and social affairs of the native Egyptian population and interceded on their behalf when dealing with the Turko-Circassian elite. Egyptians, as Muslims, were part of a wider Islamic community, yet they held on to their national identity in the face of repeated invasions in the course of nearly 2000 years. Some Egyptian writers in the Ottoman period who wrote about the history of Egypt include Ibn Zunbul, el-Bakri, el-Is{{Unicode|ḥ}}aqi and el-Sharqawi.

{{cquote|From the Egyptian side, literary works from both the Mamluk and Ottoman eras indicate that literate Egyptians had not totally submerged their identity within Islam, but retained an awareness of Egypt's distinctiveness as a uniquely fertile region of the Muslim world, as a land of great historical antiquity and splendor...At least for some Egyptians, 'the land of Egypt' (''al-diyar al-misriyya'') was an identifiable and emotionally meaningful entity within the larger Muslim polity of which it was now a province.<ref>Jankowski, p. 60</ref>}}

===Modern independence===

[[Image:Veiled woman.JPG|thumb|160px|Egyptian woman in nineteenth-century traditional local attire.]]Modern Egyptian history is generally believed to begin with the [[Napoleon I of France #The Egyptian expedition of 1798–99|French expedition]] in Egypt led by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1798. The [[French people|French]] defeated a Mamluk-Ottoman army at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]], and soon they were able to seize control of the country. The French occupation was short-lived, ending when [[British Empire|British]] troops drove out the French in 1801. Its impact on the social and cultural fabric of Egyptian society, however, was tremendous. To be sure, the Egyptians were deeply hostile to the French, whom they viewed as yet another foreign occupation to be resisted. At the same time, the French expedition introduced Egyptians to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] which were to have a significant influence on their own self-perception and realization of modern independence. When Napoleon invited the Egyptian ''ulama'' to head a French-supervised government in Egypt, for some, it awakened a sense patriotism and a desire for national independence from the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]]. In addition, the French introduced the printing press in Egypt and published its first newspaper. The monumental catalogue of Egypt's ecology, society and economy, ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'Égypte]]'', was written by scholars and scientists who accompanied the French army on their expedition. 

The withdrawal of French forces from Egypt left a power vacuum that was filled after a period of political turmoil by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], an Ottoman officer of [[Albanians|Albanian]] descent. He rallied support among the Egyptians until he was elected by the native Muslim ''ulama'' as governor of Egypt. Mohammed Ali is credited for having undertaken a massive campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and the cultivation of cash crops (notably [[cotton]], [[rice]] and [[sugarcane|sugar-cane]]), increased industrialization, and a new educational system—the results of which are felt to this day. In order to consolidate his power in Egypt, Mohammed Ali worked to eliminate the Turko-Circassian domination of administrative and army posts. For the first time since the Roman period, native Egyptians filled the junior ranks of the country's army. The army would later conduct military expeditions in the [[Levant]], [[Sudan]] and against the [[Wahhabism|Wahabis]] in [[Arabia]].<ref>Jankowskil, p. 74</ref> Many Egyptians student missions were sent to [[Europe]] in the early 19th century to study at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. One of these students, whose name was Rifa'a et-Tahtawy, was the first in a long line of intellectuals that started the modern Egyptian Renaissance.

====Renaissance====

[[Image:Tahtawi.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Rifa'a el-Tahtawy, 1801-1873, laid the groundwork for the modern Egyptian Renaissance.]]The period between 1860 − 1940 was most characterized by a ''nahda'', renaissance or rebirth of a distinct Egyptian history, culture and language. It is best known for the renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and the cultural achievements that were inspired by it. Along with this interest came an indigenous, Egypt-centered orientation, particularly among the Egyptian intelligentsia that would affect Egypt's autonomous development as a sovereign and independent nation-state.

The first modern self-conscious expression of Egyptian patriotism came in the mid-19th century from the Egyptian intellectual Rifa'a et-Tahtawi. Tahtawi was born in 1801 in a village south of [[Asyut]], the same year the French troops evacuated Egypt. He was an [[Al-Azhar University|Azharite]] recommended by his teacher and mentor Hassan el-Attar to be the chaplain of a group of students Mohammed Ali was sending to [[Paris]] in 1826. According to Tahtawi's memoir ''Rihla'' (Journey to Paris), he read works by [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] and [[Étienne Bézout|Bezout]] among others during his sojourn in [[France]].<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 113</ref> In 1831, Tahtawi returned home in Egypt to undertake a career in journalism, education and translation. He founded the School of Languages in 1835 which had a great impact on the emerging Egyptian intellectual milieu. Three of his published volumes are works of political and moral [[philosophy]] in which he introduces his Egyptian audience to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas such as [[secularism|secular]] authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or "good Egyptian"; and his ideas on public interest and public good.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 115-16</ref>

[[Image:Egypt's Awakening.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Mahmoud Mokhtar]]'s ''Nahdit Masr'' (1919−1928) became a symbol of the Egyptian Renaissance.]]Tahtawi was instrumental in sparking indigenous interest in Egypt's ancient heritage. In 1868, he published a volume on the history of [[Ancient Egypt]] in which he glorifies the wonders and achievements of his ancestors.<ref>El-Daly, p. 28</ref> He composed a number of poems in praise of Egypt and wrote two other general histories of the country. Tahtawi's work on ancient Egypt led [[Jean-François Champollion]], the French scholar credited with deciphering [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], to run a progress report on Tahtawi's work during his tenure in Paris.<ref>Reid, Donald Malcolm. ''Whose Pharaohs? Archaeology, Museums, and Egyptian National Identity from Napoleon to World War I''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002. p. 53</ref> He co-founded with his contemporary [[Ali Pasha Mubarak|Ali Mubarak]], the architect of the modern Egyptian school system, a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars like [[Suyuti]] and [[Al-Maqrizi|Maqrizi]], who studied ancient Egyptian history, language and antiquities.<ref>El-Daly, p. 29</ref> Tahtawi held a conciliatory attitude to Europeans and encouraged his compatriots to invite Europeans to come and teach the modern sciences in Egypt, drawing on the example of Pharaoh [[Psammetichus I|Psamtek I]] who had enlisted the [[Greeks]]' help in organizing the Egyptian army. In his writings, Tahtawi conceived of modern Egyptians as the natural heirs of Egypt's ancient civilization. He urged his compatriots to demonstrate "love of country" and stressed the fundamental oneness of Egyptians irrespective of creed or religion.

====Modernization====

[[Image:Silk weavers.JPG|thumb|180px|left|Egyptian silk weavers during the reign of [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]], 1880.]]Among Mohammed Ali's successors, the most influential was the pro-European [[Isma'il Pasha]] who became [[khedive]] in 1863. Ismail was determined to make Egypt independent from [[Turkey]]. His reign witnessed the growth of the army, major education reforms, the founding of the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[Khedivial Opera House|Royal Opera House]], the rise of an independent political press, a flourishing of the arts, and the inauguration of the [[Suez Canal]]. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt and eventually they came to have an important influence on governmental affairs. Village headsmen were part of the Assembly and came to exert increasing political and economic influence over the countryside.<ref>Jankowski, p. 83</ref> Several generations of Egyptians exposed to the ideas of [[constitutionalism]] made up the emerging intellectual and political milieu that slowly filled the ranks of the government, the army and institutions which had long been dominated by an aristocracy of [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Greeks]], [[Circassians]] and [[Armenians]]. These Egyptians were to have the greatest impact on the struggle for national independence and the articulation of Egyptian nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Ismail's massive modernization campaign left Egypt indebted to European powers, leading to increased European meddling in Egyptian internal affairs. Meanwhile, secret groups made up of Egyptian notables, ministers, journalists and army officers were organized across the country to oppose the increasing European influence.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 135</ref> When the British deposed of Ismail and installed his son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tawfik]], the now Egyptian-dominated army reacted violently, staging a [[Urabi Revolt|revolt]] led by Minister of War [[Ahmed Urabi]], self-styled el-Masri ('the Egyptian'), against the Khedive, the Turko-Circassian elite, and the European stronghold. The revolt was a [[Battle of Tel al-Kebir|military failure]] and [[British Empire|British]] forces occupied Egypt in 1882. Technically, Egypt was still part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the Mohammed Ali family ruling the country, though now with British supervision and according to British directives. The Egyptian army was disbanded and a smaller army commanded by British officers was installed in its place. The key British official in Egypt was the Consul-General, a post first held by [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Sir Evelyn Baring]].

====Liberal age====

[[Image:Mustafa Kamil.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Mustafa Kamil]], an anti-colonial nationalist famous for coining the phrase, "If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one", 1874 − 1908.]]Egyptian self-government, education, and the continued plight of Egypt's peasant majority deteriorated most significantly under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it took the form of an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 189</ref> Sheikh [[Muhammad Abduh]], the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar [[Mufti]], was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the [[modernism|modernist]] interpretations of [[Islam]] that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were [[Mustafa Kamil]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved in the creation of a secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, "If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one."

[[Image:Lutfi elsayed.jpg|thumb|150px|Former rector of the [[Cairo University|Egyptian University]] [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]] founded Egypt's first political party, el-Umma, in [[1907]]. He is regarded as the modern architect of secular Egyptian nationalism.]]Egyptian nationalist sentiment reached a high point after the 1906 [[Dinshaway Incident]], when following an altercation between a group of British soldiers and Egyptian farmers, four of the farmers were hanged while others were condemned to public flogging. Dinshaway, a watershed in the history of Egyptian anti-[[colonialism|colonial]] resistance, galvanized Egyptian opposition against the British, culminating in the founding of the first two political parties in Egypt: the secular, liberal ''Umma'' (the Nation, 1907) headed by [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], and the more radical, pro-Islamic ''Watani'' Party (Nationalist Party, 1908) headed by Mustafa Kamil. Lutfi was born to a family of farmers in the Delta province of [[Ad Daqahliyah|Daqahliya]] in [[1872]]. He was educated at al-Azhar where he attended lectures by Mohammed Abduh. Abduh came to have a profound influence on Lutfi's reformist thinking in later years. In 1907, he founded the Umma Party newspaper, el-Garida, whose statement of purpose read: "El-Garida is a purely Egyptian party which aims to defend Egyptian interests of all kinds."<ref>qtd. in Vatikiotis, p. 227</ref> 

Both the People and Nationalist parties came to dominate Egyptian politics until [[World War I]], but the new leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which [[Great Britain]] declared Egypt a British [[protectorate]]) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]] and the People's Party. Prominent among these was [[Saad Zaghlul]] who led the new movement through the [[Wafd Party]]. 

[[Image:1919 revolution.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Egyptian women demonstrated along with men in the [[Egyptian revolution of 1919|1919 Revolution]] precipitated by the British-ordered exile of nationalist leader [[Saad Zaghlul]].]]Saad Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as 'Father of the Egyptians'. When on March 8, 1919 the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to [[Malta]], the Egyptian people staged their [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt by students, civil servants, merchants, peasants, workers, religious leaders; by Egyptian women; by Copts as well as Muslims became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.<ref>Jankowski, p. 112</ref> The uprising in the Egyptian countryside was more violent, involving attacks on British military installations, civilian facilities and personnel. By the end of March, it was apparent that the Wafd had gained countrywide support leading [[London]] to issue a unilateral declaration of Egyptian independence on February 22, 1922.

The Wafd Party drafted a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|new Constitution in 1923]] based on a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] representative system. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly-elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924, and in 1936 the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded. Many cultural and economic developments accompanied the inter-war period. New forces that came to prominence were the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the [[Misr El-Fatah (Young Egypt) Party|Young Egypt Party]], which attracted more radical elements of Egyptian society. In 1920, [[Banque Misr]] (Bank of Egypt) was founded by [[Talaat Pasha Harb]] as "an Egyptian bank for Egyptians only"<ref>qtd. in Jankowski p. 123</ref> which restricted shareholding to native Egyptians. Bank Misr helped finance various new Egyptian-owned businesses, including textile factories, insurance, publishing and tourism companies, along with Egypt's national airline [[EgyptAir]].

[[Image:Flag of Egypt 1922.svg|thumb|150px|Egyptian flag during the constitutional monarchy, 1922 − 1952. The three stars represented modern Egypt's three major religions: Islam, Christianity and Judaism.]]Under the parliamentary monarchy, Egypt reached the peak of its modern intellectual Renaissance that was started by Rifa'a el-Tahtawy nearly a century earlier. The most prominent Egyptian thinkers and writers of modern history belonged to this period. Among those who set the intellectual tone of a newly independent Egypt, in addition to [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], were [[Qasim Amin]], [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]], [[Taha Hussein]], [[Abbas Al-Akkad|Abbas el-'Akkad]], [[Tawfiq al-Hakeem|Tawfiq el-Hakeem]], and [[Salama Moussa]]. They delineated a liberal outlook for their country expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, [[secularism]], an [[evolution]]ary view of the world and faith in science to bring progress to human society.<ref>Jankowski, p. 130</ref> This period was looked upon with fondness by future generations of Egyptians as a [[Golden Age]] of Egyptian liberalism, openness, and an Egypt-centered attitude that put the country's interests center stage. 

When Egyptian novelist and [[Noble Prize]] laureate [[Naguib Mahfouz]] died in 2006, many Egyptians felt that perhaps the last of the Greats of Egypt's golden age had passed away. In his dialogues with close associate and journalist Mohamed Salmawy, published as ''Mon Égypte'', Mahfouz had this to say:

{{cquote|Egypt is not just a piece of land. Egypt is the inventor of civilisation... The strange thing is that this country of great history and unsurpassed civilisation is nothing but a thin strip along the banks of the Nile... This thin strip of land created moral values, launched the concept of monotheism, developed arts, invented science and gave the world a stunning administration. These factors enabled the Egyptians to survive while other cultures and nations withered and died... Throughout history Egyptians have felt that their mission is to tend to life. They were proud to turn the land green, to make it blossom with life. The other thing is that Egyptians invented morality long before the major religions appeared on earth. Morality is not just a system for control but a protection against chaos and death... Egypt gave Islam a new voice. It didn't change the basic tenets of Islam, but its cultural weight gave Islam a new voice, one it didn't have back in Arabia. Egypt embraced an Islam that was moderate, tolerant and non-extremist. Egyptians are very pious, but they know how to mix piety with joy, just as their ancestors did centuries ago. Egyptians celebrate religious occasions with flair. For them, religious festivals and the month of Ramadan are occasions to celebrate life.<ref>Salmawy, Mohamed. [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/807/op6.htm 'Dialogues of Naguib Mahfouz: Mon Egypte']. Al-Ahram Weekly. 10 - 16 August 2006.</ref>}}

====Republic====

[[Image:MohamedNagib2.gif|thumb|150px|[[Muhammad Naguib]], 1901 − 1984, was the first President of the Republic of Egypt, a post he held for only a year.]]Increased involvement by the [[Farouk of Egypt|King]] in parliamentary affairs, government corruption, and the widening gap between the country's rich and poor led to the eventual toppling of the monarchy and the dissolution of the parliament through a ''[[coup d'état]]'' by a group of [[Free Officers Movement|army officers]] in 1952. The Egyptian Republic was declared on June 18, 1953 with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. After Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and later put under house arrest by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the real architect of the 1952 movement, mass protests by Egyptians erupted against the forced resignation of what became a popular symbol of the new régime.<ref>Jankowski, p. 137</ref> Nevertheless, Nasser assumed [[Political power|power]] as President and began a [[nationalization]] process that initially had profound effects on the socioeconomic strata of Egyptian society. According to one historian, "Egypt had, for the first time since 343 BC, been ruled not by a Macedonian [[Greek people|Greek]], nor a [[Roman Empire|Roman]], nor an [[Arabs|Arab]], nor a [[Turkish people|Turk]], but by an Egyptian."<ref>Watterson, p. 294</ref>

Nasser nationalized the [[Suez Canal]] leading to the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]. Egypt became increasingly involved in regional affairs until three years after the 1967 [[Six Day War]], in which Egypt lost the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] to [[Israel]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]]. Sadat revived an ''Egypt Above All'' orientation, switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[United States]], expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy. Like his predecessor, he also clamped down on religious and leftist opposition alike. In 1977, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel leading to the signing of the 1978 [[Camp David Accords|peace treaty]], which was supported by the vast majority of Egyptians,<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 443</ref> in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat was finally assassinated in [[Cairo]] by a fundamentalist soldier in 1981, and was succeeded by [[Hosni Mubarak]].

[[Image:Kefaya demo.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Kifaya]] is a grassroots movement and a form of non-violent resistance organized on the Egyptian street with the goal to achieve equality and democracy.]]President [[Hosni Mubarak|Mohamed Hosni Mubarak]] has been the [[President of Egypt|President of the Republic]] since [[October 14]] [[1981]], currently serving his fifth term in office. Although power is ostensibly organized under a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[semi-presidential system]], in practice it rests almost solely with the President. In late February 2005, Mubarak announced in a surprise television broadcast that he had ordered the reform of the country's presidential election law, paving the way for multi-candidate polls. For the first time since the 1952 coup d'état, the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates. However, the new law placed draconian restrictions on the filing for presidential candidacies, designed to prevent well-known candidates such as [[Ayman Nour]] from standing against Mubarak, and paved the road for his easy re-election victory. 

Most Egyptians today are skeptical about the process of [[democratization]] and fear that power may ultimately be transferred to the President's first son, [[Gamal Mubarak]]. Newspapers, however, have since exhibited an increasing degree of freedom in criticizing the President. In 2003, the [[Kifaya|Egyptian Movement for Change]] or simply ''Kifaya'' was founded as a grassroots mobilization of Egyptians from different socioeconomic, political and religious backgrounds seeking a return to democracy, a transparent government and greater equality and freedom. 

The long road to Egyptian independence took more than 20 centuries to achieve, and for many Egyptians it is still a work in progress. Egyptians have endured as a people for more than 5,000 years thanks in large part to Egypt's unique geography. They take pride in their pharaonic heritage and in their descent from one of mankind's earliest civilizations.

{{cquote|Egypt for the first time [since the Pharaonic era] is truly Egyptian. There are no sizeable foreign communities resident in the country any more...the impact of the October 1973 War (also known as the Ramadan or Yom Kippur War) found Egyptians reverting to an earlier sense of national identity, that of Egyptianism. Egypt became their foremost consideration and top priority in contrast to the earlier one, preferred by the Nasser régime, of Egypt's role and primacy in the Arab world. This kind of national 'restoration' was led by the Old Man of Egyptian Nationalism, Tawfiq el-Hakim, who in the 1920s and 1930s was associated with the [[Pharaonism|Pharaonist movement]]....[The Egyptians] have a kind of local social resistance—a tenacity which derives from their geographical-historical experience as a nation—both to pressure from their own State and government and to change...This perhaps is also the secret of the survival of Egyptians for so many thousands of years in a country which has seen so many God-Kings, Emperors, Prefects, Governors, Caliphs, Satraps, Sultans and other rulers. It became acceptable for Egyptians under Sadat and Mubarak to claim an Egyptian identity first and foremost. Their Arabism constitutes for them a cultural dimension of their identity, not a necessary attribute of or prop for their national political being.<ref>Vatikiotis, pp. 499-500</ref>}}

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Egypt}}
Egyptian culture boasts five millennia of recorded history. [[Ancient Egypt]] was among the earliest and greatest civilizations during which the Egyptians maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of [[Europe]], the [[Near East]] and [[Africa]]. After the Pharaonic era, the Egyptians themselves came under the influence of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], [[Coptic Christianity|Christianity]] and [[Muslim culture|Islamic]] culture. Today, many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern [[Western culture]], itself with roots in Ancient Egypt.

===Surnames===

It is common for people of Egyptian origins to have surnames beginning with "Ba/Be" which is the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] masculine singular definite article; for example, [[Tamer Bayoumi|Bayoumi]] بيومي ("of the sea", i.e. Lower Egyptian) (variations: Baioumi, Bayoumi, Baioumy), Bashandi بشندي , Bakhum باخوم ("the eagle"), Bekhit, Bahur ("of [[Horus]]") and Banoub بانوب ("of [[Anubis]]"). The name Shenouda شنوده, which is very common among [[Copt]]s (e.g., it is the name of the present [[Shenouda III|Egyptian Pope]] as well as that of one of the Coptic Church's [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|foremost saints]]), means "God is living". Hence names, and many [[toponym]]s, may end with -nouda or -nuti which is the Egyptian word for God. In addition, Egyptian families often derive their name from places in Egypt, such as el-Minyawi المنياوي from [[Al Minya Governorate|Minya]] and [[Suyuti]] السيوطي from [[Asyut]]; or from one of the local [[Sufi]] orders such as el-Shazli الشاذلي and el-Sawy الصاوي.

With the adoption of Christianity and eventually Islam, Egyptians began to take on names associated with these religions. Many Egyptian surnames also became [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] and [[Arabization|Arabized]], meaning they were altered to sound [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This was done by the addition of the Greek suffix ''-ios'' to Egyptian names; for example, Bakhum > Pachomios; or by adding the Arabic definite article ''el'' (Classical Arabic ''al'') to names such as Baymoui > el-Bayoumi. Names starting with the Egyptian affix ''bu'' ("place") were often Arabized to ''abu'' ("father of"); for example, [[Busiri]] بوصيري ("of the place of [[Osiris]]") occasionally became Abusir and al-Busiri. Some people might also have surnames like el-Shami الشامي ("the Levantine") indicating a possible Levantine origin, or Turkish Dawidar دويدار, an Ottoman-Mamluk remnant. Conversely, some Levantines might carry the surname el-Masri ("the Egyptian") suggesting a possible Egyptian extraction. The Egyptian peasantry, the fellahin, are often likely to retain indigenous names with little to no change given their relative isolation throughout the country's history.

===Language===
{{main|Egyptian language|Coptic language|Egyptian Arabic}}

[[Image:Papyrus Ebers.png|150px|thumb|left|[[Ebers Papyrus]] detailing treatment for [[asthma]] in [[hieratic]] [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], ''c''. 1550 BC.]]The ancient [[Egyptian language]] constitutes an independent branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] language [[phylum (linguistics)|phylum]]. Its closest relatives are the [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], and [[Beja language|Beja]] groups of languages. Written records of Egyptian have been dated from about [[32nd century BC|3200 BC]], making it one of the oldest and longest documented languages. The language survived in its [[Coptic language|Coptic]] stage of development until the [[17th century]], and while it ceased to be spoken, it continues to be the language of [[liturgy]] in the Coptic Church. Attempts at revitalization are currently underway by some [[Liberal Egyptian Party|local groups]].

The [[national language]] of Egypt today is [[Egyptian Arabic]]. Its earliest recorded history comes in the form of a document by a sixteenth century linguist writing about the peculiarities of the speech of the Egyptian people. This suggests that the language by then was spoken by the majority of Egyptians. It is represented in a body of [[vernacular literature]] comprising novels, plays and poetry published over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Classical Arabic is also a significant cultural element in Egyptian culture, as Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated.

===Contribution to humanity===

The Egyptians have played a significant role in the development of [[arts]] and [[sciences]], and have contributed some of the world's most important inventions. The irrigation methods developed by early Egyptians led to cooperation and the development of the first centralized [[government]] based on professional knowledge, a rule of hydraulic [[engineers]]. The earliest evidence (''c''. 1600 BC) of traditional [[empiricism]] and the [[scientific method]] is credited to Egypt, as evidenced by the [[Edwin Smith papyrus|Edwin Smith]] and [[Ebers papyrus|Ebers papyri]]. Egyptian inventions include [[Egyptian calendar|a 365-day calendar]], 24-hour division of the day and [[Cement|hydraulic cement]].

Today, Egypt has the highest number of [[Nobel Prize]] Laureates in Africa and of any country in the Muslim world.
