'''Joseph Bolitho Johns''' (c. 1826â€“[[August 13]] [[1900]]), better known as '''Moondyne Joe''', was [[Western Australia]]'s best known [[bushranger]].

== Life of Moondyne Joe ==
Little is known of Joseph Johns's early life. Born in [[Cornwall]], [[England]] around 1826 and raised as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], he was the third of six children of [[blacksmith]] Thomas Johns and his wife Mary. It is likely that he contracted [[smallpox]] in his youth, as later records describe him as "pockmarked". His father died some time between 1832 and 1841, and Johns and his three brtook work as [[copper]] [[miner]]s.  In 1841 the family was living at [[Illogan]], [[Penwith]], Cornwall, but by 1848 Johns had migrated to Wales, taking work as an [[iron ore]] miner, probably at the [[Clydach]] Iron Works.<ref name="Devereux 2006">{{cite journal | author = Devereux, Drew | year = 2006 | title = Early life of Moondyne Joe | journal = Dollypot, Greenhide and Spindrift: a journal of bush history | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | url = http://www.hesperianpress.com/dollypot_greenhide/Vol2_no3.htm | accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref>

On [[15 November]] [[1848]], Johns and an associate named [[John Williams (convict)|John Williams]] were arrested near [[Chepstow]] for "... stealing from the house of Richard Price, three loaves of bread, one piece of bacon, several cheeses, and other goods".<ref name="The Welshman 30/03/1849">{{cite news | title = [[Wikisource:The Welshman/30 March 1849|Breconshire Lent Assizes]] | work = [[Wikisource:The Welshman|The Welshman]] | page = 1849-03-30}}</ref> [[Arraignment|Arraigned]] at the [[Brecon]] [[Assize Court#England and Wales|Assizes]] on charges of [[burglary]] and [[stealing]], the pair [[plea]]ded not guilty.  On [[23 March]] they were tried at the Lent Assizes before [[William Erle|Sir William Erle]].  Newspaper reports of the trial suggest that the pair gave an unexpectedly spirited defence, but Johns was abrasive and "contravened the conventions of court procedure".  The men were convicted and sentenced to ten years' [[penal labour|penal servitude]].  Edgar (1990) observes that in several other cases brought before the same judge that day, guilty pleas to very similar charges resulted in sentences ranging from three weeks to three months.<ref name="Edgar 1990">{{cite book|author=Edgar, W.

Johns and Williams would have spent the next seven months working on a government work party in the local area, before being transferred to [[Millbank Prison]].  On [[1 January]] [[1850]], they were transferred to [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville Prison]] to serve their mandatory six months of [[solitary confinement]].  The pair were transferred to [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]] on [[21 October]] [[1851]], but shortly afterwards Johns was transferred to the [[Woolwich]] [[hulk (ship)|prison hulk]] ''Justitia'', probably for [[discipline|disciplinary]] reasons.  When the ''Justitia'' was destroyed by fire, he was transferred to the ''Defence''.  About a year later, he boarded the ''[[Pyrenees (ship)|Pyrenees]]'' for [[penal transportation|transportation]] to what was then the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[penal colony]] of [[Western Australia]].<ref name="Edgar 1990"/>

The ''Pyrenees'' sailed for Western Australia on [[2 February]] [[1853]], and arrived in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] on [[30 April]].  In reward for good behaviour, Johns was issued with a [[ticket of leave]] on arrival, and on [[10 March]] [[1855]] he received a conditional pardon.  He then settled in the [[Avon River (Western Australia)|Avon]] Valley, one of the most rugged and inaccessible places in the [[Darling Range]].  The [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] name for the area was ''Moondyne''.  Johns made a living by partly fencing the springs in the area, and trapping escaped stock and horses.  Often a reward was offered for the return of such animals.<ref name="Edgar 1990"/>

In August 1861, Johns caught an unbranded stallion, and branded it with his own mark.  This was effectively horse-stealing, and when the police heard of this they arrested him at their first opportunity.  The horse was taken as evidence, and Johns was placed in the [[Toodyay, Western Australia|Toodyay]] lockup.  Sometime during the night, Johns broke out of his cell, and stole the horse once more, taking also the local magistrate's brand new saddle and bridle.  He was caught the next day, but while on the run he had killed the horse and cut his brand out of the hide, thus destroying the evidence.  Consequently, he received only a three year sentence for jail-breaking, whereas a typical sentence for horse stealing was more than ten years.<ref name="Elliot 1978">{{cite book|author=Elliot, Ian|year=1978|title=Moondyne Joe: The Man and the Myth|location=Nedlands, Western Australia | publisher=University of Western Australia Press|id=ISBN 0-85564-130-4}} Republished in 1998 by Carlisle, Western Australia: Hesperian Press. ISBN 0-85905-244-3.</ref>

While Johns was serving his sentence, there were a rash of convict escapes and attempted escapes, but Johns remained well behaved.  His good behaviour earned him a remission on his sentence, and he was released on a ticket of leave in February 1864.  He then found work on a farm in [[Kelmscott, Western Australia|Kelmscott]], but in January 1865 a neighbour's steer was killed and eaten, and Johns was accused of having done the deed.  Johns was to protest his innocence of this crime for the rest of his life, but was nonetheless found guilty and sentenced to ten years' penal servitude.  Johns was determined not to serve what he felt was an unjust sentence, and in early November he and another prisoner absconded from a work party.  They were on the run for nearly a month, during which time they committed a number of small robberies.  It was during this time that Johns first adopted the nickname ''Moondyne Joe''.  They were finally caught 37 kilometres east of [[York, Western Australia|York]] by a party of policemen that included the Aboriginal tracker [[Tommy Windich]].  For absconding and for being in possession of a firearm, Moondyne Joe was sentenced to twelve months in irons.<ref name="Elliot 1978"/>

In April 1865, Joe sent a petition to the [[Chief Justice of Western Australia|Chief Justice]], and received four years off his sentence.  This was apparently unsatisfactory to him, for later that month he received a further six months in irons for trying to cut the lock out of his door.  Early in August, he succeeded in escaping again.  After cutting off his irons, he met up with three other escapees, and together they roamed the bush around Perth, committing a number of robberies and narrowly escaping capture on a number of occasions.  Near the end of the month, one of the gang was captured by police.  Realising that the gang could not elude the police forever, Moondyne Joe formulated a plan to escape the colony by travelling overland to the colony of South Australia.  This would be a long and arduous journey through extremely arid land, and would have to be very well equipped if it were to stand any chance of success.  On [[5 September]] Moondyne Joe equipped his company by committing the biggest robbery of his career, stealing supplies and equipment from the Toodyay store of an old enemy, James Everett.  The gang then started travelling east along the explorer [[Charles Cooke Hunt|Charles Hunt]]'s established route.  Their tracks were discovered by police on [[26 September]], about 160 kilometres east of York.  A team of police then set out after them, and they were captured on [[29 September]] near the present-day site of the town of [[Westonia, Western Australia|Westonia]], about 300 kilometres north east of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].<ref name="Elliot 1978"/>

[[Image:FremantleprisonMoondynescell.JPG|thumb|right|Moondyne Joe's "escape-proof" cell]]
As punishment for escaping and for the robberies committed while on the run, Moondyne Joe received five years hard labour on top of his remaining sentence.  Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that Johns did not escape again. He was transferred to [[Fremantle Prison]] where a special "escape-proof" cell was made for him, built from stone and lined with sleepers.  He was set to work breaking stone, but rather than permit him to leave the prison, the stone was brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Johns worked under the constant supervision of a warder.  [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] [[John Hampton]] was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Johns: "If you get out again, I'll forgive you".  However, the rock broken by Joe was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of Joe below the waist.  Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the [[limestone]] wall of the prison.  On [[7 March]] [[1867]], Moondyne Joe escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall.  Despite an extensive manhunt, no sign of him was found, and he would not be recaptured for nearly two years.  He did not return to any of his old haunts, and he committed no crimes, so the authorities received very little information about him.  Also, many convicts were encouraged by Moondyne Joe's audacious escape, and a number of escapes were attempted in the following months, so that he was quickly forgotten.<ref name="Elliot 1978"/>

A few days before the second anniversary of his escape, Moondyne Joe tried to steal some wine from the cellars at [[Houghton Winery]].  By chance, the owner had been helping with a police search, and afterwards invited a group of police back to the vineyard for refreshments.  When the owner entered the cellar, Joe assumed that he was discovered, and made a dash for the door into the arms of the police.  He was returned to prison, and on [[March 22]] [[1869]] was sentenced to an additional four years in irons.  He made at least one more attempt to escape, but was unsuccessful.  Eventually, Governor [[Frederick Weld|Weld]] heard  of his predecessor Hampton's promise, and decided that further punishment would be unfair.  Moondyne Joe was given a ticket of leave in April 1871.<ref name="Elliot 1978"/>

The remainder of John's life consisted of periods of good behaviour punctuated by occasional minor misdemeanors and brief jail terms.  In January 1879, he married a widow named Louisa Hearn, and they spent some time prospecting for gold near [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]].  In 1881, while exploring the countryside around [[Karridale]], he discovered [[Moondyne Cave]].  In his later years, he began acting strangely, and was eventually found to be mentally ill.  He died of [[dementia|senile dementia]] in the Fremantle Lunatic Asylum (now the [[Fremantle Arts Centre]] building) on [[13 August]] [[1900]], and was buried in [[Fremantle Cemetery]].<ref name="Elliot 1978"/>

On the first Sunday of May, the township of Toodyay celebrates the life and times of Moondyne Joe by holding the Moondyne Festival. This festival takes place in the main street and has street theatre, market stalls, demonstrations and the entire town is generally transported back to the early years. The next Moondyne Festival will be May 4 2008.

[[Image:The Legend of Moondyne Joe book cover.jpg|thumb|right|Mark Greenwood's work of juvenile fiction ''The Legend of Moondyne Joe'' won the award for Children's Books in the 2002 [[Western Australian Premier's Book Awards]].]]
While Moondyne Joe was bushranging in 1869, an [[Ireland|Irish]] political prisoner named [[John Boyle O'Reilly]] was serving time in Fremantle Prison.  Although it is very unlikely that O'Reilly knew Moondyne Joe, he must have heard many stories of Joe's exploits.  In September 1869, O'Reilly escaped and was rescued by an [[United States|American]] ship.  After his arrival in the United States, he wrote a novel about convict life called [[Moondyne|Moondyne: An Australian Tale]], whose central character was called ''Moondyne Joe''.  The book is presented as fiction, and neither the character nor the plot bears much resemblance to the life of Joseph Johns. 

In 1913, O'Reilly's novel was made into a movie entitled ''Moondyne''.<ref name="Routt 2002">{{cite journal|author=Routt, William D.|year=2002|title=More Australian than Aristotelian: The Australian Bushranger Film, 1904â€“1914|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/18/oz_western.html|journal=Senses of Cinema|issue=18}}</ref> Directed by [[W.

A railway siding on the [[Eastern Goldfields Railway]] in Johns' area of operations in the Avon Valley has been named 'Moondyne', most likely after the man rather than the area.
