==Plot==
Quahog becomes the subject of a [[Flu|flu epidemic]], Peter goes to see [[List of Family Guy characters|Dr. Hartman]] for a vaccine. Though they are in short supply, Peter manages to get one anyway (he “accidentally” falls onto the jab Hartman was holding). While looking through his papers, Hartman realizes that Peter needs a prostate exam. Though he does not know what it is, Peter agrees to take one. The exam is not what he expects, shocked by the doctor sticking his finger up his anus. Peter becmomes convinced that he was [[Rape|raped]], shocked at the whole situation. He tells Lois about it, but she tries to convince him that it was a standard examination, but Peter is too upset to comprehend, and pointing gestures from the television make more upset. When he tells Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe about the experience, however, they greatly empathize him as they recount how Dr. Hartman “violated” them as well. Upon hearing this, Peter’s fear becomes outrage when he decides to sue his doctor.

Lois is entirely non-supportive of Peter’s ambition and unsuccessfully tries to talk him out of it. When the trial occurs, Peter unintentionally exaggerates the story to make it seem worse (claiming that Hartman made several sexual remarks and laughed). Hartman is outraged and tries to convince the judge it was a standard exam, saying that he gave him one not too long ago. However, Peter tells the judge to imagine the experience in the same light as his own story, after which Hartman is declared guilty and has his license revoked.

Upon celebrating his victory of Dr. Hartman, he celebrates at [[The_Drunken_Clam#Arts_and_entertainment|The Drunken Clam]], however begins to go to the bathroom frequently, causing concern among his friends. Peter is then informed that his prostate may be infected and, that he is in need of a prostate examination. Upon realising he needs an examination, he is informed by his friends that no doctor would examine him after the "rape" incident. Peter then attempts to have Dr. Hartman unknowingly perform the exam, by posing as a mailman, however this fails. When realising he has almost been tricked, Hartman decides to perform the examination, and in return, Peter drops the charges against him — with his medical licence being reinstated.

Meanwhile, Stewie is at the park with Lois when his teddy bear, Rupert, is stolen by a dog. Upon calling for help, Lois retrieves Rupert, who is almost destroyed. Seeing how upset Stewie is at the concept of losing Rupert, Lois repairs him as much as possible, t his delighting Stewie, who begins to show a fondness to Lois. Stewie becomes dependent on her, which exhausts Lois, to the extent of her having a nightmare of attempting to harm Stewie. Horrified by her dream, Lois turns to Brian for guidance. Brian suggest Lois take a more hands-off approach of parenting Stewie, to which he does not take well too. When Stewie goes to confront Lois about this after pretending to have [[overdose|overdosed]] on tablets, he falls down the stairs. Lois then rushes to his aid, only for him to reject her loving of him, returning to his previous lifestyle of trying to harm her.<ref name="Episode">{{cite video|year=2005|title=Plot synopsis information for the episode "Stewie Loves Lois"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

==Production==
When Stewie is fantasizing about murdering and harming Lois, he performs several karate and kung fu moves. This is a reference to an individual who knew [[Mark Hentemann]], a writer for ''Family Guy'' used to know. He was the boy who would come to school, car washes or other events and tell stories about the people who he had been in physical fights with.<ref name="MacFarlane">{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|year=2007|title=Family Guy volume 5 (Region 1) or Season 6 (Region 2) DVD commentary for the episode "Stewie Loves Lois"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> During the scene when Stewie describes Lois as being the female version of [[Bonnie Hunt]], MacFarlane comments that he feels bad about that joke, as just before it was broadcast — Hunt telephoned him on his mobile phone and told him about how much she enjoyed the show, however the gag was not removed due to its expected airing date being so close to when the telephone call was made.<ref name="MacFarlane"/>

For a reason which was not specified, the sound of Lois's footsteps when going down the basement stairs during her dream of killing Stewie, had to be overcome by Stewie talking more often. This line of Stewie making general conversation in the same scene, was altered several times due to lack of laughter from the audience.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> MacFarlane  comments that the scene of Peter standing up to his teacher who was giving the class a [[Exam|written examination]], is a reference to "80's TV bullshit".<ref name="MacFarlane"/><ref name="Goodman"/>
