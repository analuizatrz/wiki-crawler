The '''Historic Michigan Boulevard District''' is a historic district in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]] encompassing [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] between 11th (1100 south in the street numbering system) or  [[Roosevelt Road]] (1200 south), depending on the source, and Randolph Streets (150 north) and named after the nearby [[Great Lakes|Great Lake]].<ref name=CL>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/M/MichBlvd.html|title=Historic Michigan Boulevard District|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|date=2003|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref><ref name=SC>Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', Loyola University Press, 1988, ISBN 0-8294-0597-6.</ref><ref>Emporis claims this district extends to Randolph street which is 1200 South.</ref> It was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on [[February 27]] [[2002]].<ref name=CL/> The district includes numerous significant buildings on Michigan Avenue facing [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]].<ref name=EMP>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100014|accessdate=2007-05-31|date=2007|title=Michigan Avenue Landmark District|publisher=Emporis}}</ref>  In addition, this section of Michigan Avenue includes the point recognized as the end of [[U.S. Route 66]].  This district is one of the world's most well known one-sided streets rivalling [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City]] and [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Princes Street]].<ref name=CL/>  It lies immediately south of the [[Michigan-Wacker Historic District]] and east of the [[Loop Retail Historic District]] as well as a quarter of a mile south of the [[Chicago River]], [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]] and the [[Magnificent Mile]].

Michigan Avenue is named for [[Lake Michigan]], which it once ran alongside at 100 east in the city's street numbering system until [[landfill]] for Grant Park (then Lake Park) pushed the shoreline east.<ref>Hayner and McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', "Michigan Avenue", p. 87.</ref>  The one-sided street feature is due in large part to the legal battles of [[Aaron Montgomery Ward]] with the city over cleaning up the park and removing most of the structures in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/538.html|title=Grant Park|accessdate=2007-06-02|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>  Ward opposed the development of Grant Park with public buildings along the lakefront except for the [[Art Institute of Chicago Building]].<ref name=AIAGtC14>Sinkevitch, Alice, "AIA Guide to Chicago" (2nd edition),, p. 14 2004, Harcourt Books, ISBN 0-15-602908-1.</ref>  Eventually, Ward's ideas were adopted by [[Daniel Burnham]] in his [[Plan of Chicago]], which called for "insured light, air, and an agreeable outlook" along the Grant Park street frontage.<ref name=CLBMT/>  The preservation of the lakefront view has inspired architects to create an architectural cornucopia of designs along the "streetwall".

At no point is Michigan Avenue currently called Michigan [[Boulevard]], but prior to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, the street was officially known as Michigan Boulevard and often referred to as "Boul Mich".<ref name=CLBMT>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/Tours/BoulMich.html|title=Boul Mich Tour|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|date=2003|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> As recently as the 1920s, North Michigan Avenue (especially the [[Magnificent Mile]]) was referred to as "Upper Boul Mich".<ref name=CNMAic>Stamper, John M., "Chicago's North Michigan Avenue," University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. ix, ISBN 0-226-77085-0.</ref>   [[Paris]]' [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]] is the original Boul Mich.

[[Image:Armistice Day celebration on South Michigan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Armistice Day]] parade 1918]]
The district has changed over the years as various architectural designs have evolved to compliment it.  The boulevard was widened between 1909 and 1910 causing the [[Art Institute of Chicago Building]] to have to move the lions guarding its entrance back 12 feet.<ref>"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" Volume 14, no. 1, 1988, The Art Institute of Chicago, p. 8, ISBN 0-226-02813-5</ref>  At that time, the Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue intersection (the end of route 66) was known as "route center".<ref name=RouteCtr>{{cite web|url=http://windycityroadwarrior.com/Stories/mich-jcksn-1914.htm|accessdate=2007-06-07|title=Route Center: Jackson and Michigan Boulevards Circa 1907-1923|publisher=David G. Clark|date=2004}}</ref>  Also at that time, the boulevard had no streets crossing it and extending eastward, and thus, the Jackson intersection was a T intersection.  This was still true in 1920 when the [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]] opened and increased traffic by connecting this boulevard with the [[Magnificent Mile]] and the community north of the [[Chicago River]] a quarter mile to the north of this district.<ref name=RouteCtr/>  The ''[[Fountain of the Great Lakes]]'' (installed in 1913) was highly visible from route center.<ref name=RouteCtr/>  Today, four streets cross Michigan Avenue within the district (in addition to its northern and southern endpoints at crossing streets).  Three of the four change names as they cross Michigan: eastbound East Monroe Street (100 south) becomes East Monroe Drive; eastbound East Jackson Boulevard (300 south) becomes  East Jackson Drive; and two-way East Congress Parkway (500 south) becomes East Congress Drive as it crosses into Grant Park to the east.<ref name=500SMI>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=500+S+Michigan+Ave,+Chicago,+Cook,+Illinois+60601,+United+States&sll=41.875664,-87.624378&sspn=0.010321,0.028667&ie=UTF8&ll=41.875664,-87.624378&spn=0.020643,0.057335&z=15|title=500 S Michigan Ave Chicago, IL 60605|accessdate=2008-04-29|publisher=Google - Maps Data/ NAVTEQ}}</ref> East Balbo Drive (700 south) does not change names as it crosses Michigan.<ref name=500SMI/>

==Today==

Today the only building on the eastern side of Michigan Avenue in the Historic District hosts the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].  However, several interesting structures have been added to the northern part of the eastern side of Michigan Avenue in [[Millennium Park]] such as [[Crown Fountain]] and [[McCormick Tribune Plaza]]. The current "End Historic US 66" marker is now located along Michigan Avenue in this district to mark the official end of [[U.S. Route 66]] [[U.S. Route 66 in Illinois|in Illinois]], but this and several others transverse Michigan Avenue  within Grant Park because landfill has created two blocks of real estate between Michigan Avenue and the Lake Michigan shoreline.  Also, the Fountain was relocated and is no longer easily seen from Michigan Avenue.

Among the current issues today is the trend to redevelop properties by constructing grand towers behind the [[facade]]s of historic structures along Michigan and Wabash Avenues (the parallel street one block to the west). The most recent examples of this have been the [[The Heritage at Millennium Park]], the [[Legacy Tower|Legacy at Millennium Park]] and the 80-story tower proposed as part of the YWCA building redevelopment at 830 S. Michigan Avenue. This trend is now endangering the Chicago Athletic Association Annex, which has  been proposed for demolition to make way for a fifty- to eighty-story condominium tower across from [[Millennium Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarks.org/chicago_watch_2006_1.htm|accessdate=2007-05-31|title=Chicago Athletic Association Building and Annex|date=2007|publisher=Landmarks Illinois}}</ref> As a result, the building is listed first on the 2006-07 Chicagoland Watch List of the [[Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarks.org/chicago_watch.htm|accessdate=2007-05-31|title=Chicagoland Watch List 2006-07|date=2007|publisher=Landmarks Illinois}}</ref>  On the other hand many were concerned that the landmark district designation would stagnate development of the area.<ref name=GPswsbeaGm>{{cite web|url=http://www.nearwestgazette.com/Archive/2008/0308/News0308e.htm|title=Grant Park street wall, surrounding buildings examined at GPAC meeting |accessdate=2008-04-07|date=|publisher=nearwestgazette.com|author=Carlton, Hayley}}</ref>  The purpose of the designation was to "keep the architecture there and encourage architecture like it and keep the wall of the park," according to the City's Department of Planning and Development.  Thus, redevolpment for new uses will be part of the ongoing concerns for the neighborhood. Thus, buildings being renovated for condos and [[dormitory|dormitories]] is a part of the present and future for the district.<ref name=GPswsbeaGm/>

Several of the buildings listed below have played a prominent role in the cultural history of Chicago.  

The Blackstone has become part of Chicago's history as the city that has hosted more [[United States presidential nominating convention]]s (26) than any other two American cities,<ref name=EOCPC>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/986.html|accessdate=2007-03-28|date=2005|author=Sautter, R. Craig|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|title=Political Conventions|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago}}</ref> The Blackstone Hotel has hosted almost every 20th century [[U.S. President]],<ref name=CGH>Allegrini, Robert V., ''Chicago's Grand Hotels'', 2005, Arcadia Publishing, p.92.</ref> and it has contributed the phrase “in a [[smoke-filled room]]" to [[United States|American]] political parlance.<ref>Wolfe, Gerard R., ''Chicago In and Around the Loop: Walking Tours of Architecture and History'', 1996, McGraw-Hill, p.176.</ref><ref name=EOCSFR>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3217.html|accessdate=2007-05-27 |date=2005 |title=Smoke-Filled Room |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago}}</ref>  

The [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] debuted on [[October 16]], [[1891]] and made its home in the [[Auditorium Theatre]] until moving to [[Orchestra Hall]] in 1904. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] gave his famous ''Bull Moose'' speech in 1912 at the Auditorium and was nominated for [[President of the United States]] by the independent [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|National Progressive Party]].  The Auditorium has hosted [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Who]], [[The Grateful Dead]], and many others.  The Auditorium Building is considered a milestone in the development of modern architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/A/Auditorium.html|accessdate=2007-07-16|date=2003 |publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|title=Auditorium Building}}</ref>

The [[Chicago Cultural Center]] serves as the city's official reception venue where the [[Mayor of Chicago]] has welcomed Presidents and royalty, diplomats and community leaders. According to ''[[Crain's Chicago Business]]'', the Chicago Cultural Center was the eighth most-visited cultural institution in the Chicago area in 2004, with 767,000 visitors.  The interior includes ornate [[mosaic]]s, [[marble]]s, [[bronze]], and [[stained-glass]] domes designed by the [[Tiffany]] Glass and Decorating Company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/C/CulturalCenter.html|accessdate=2007-07-16|date=2003 |publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|title=Chicago Public Library/Cultural Center}}</ref>

The [[Art Institute of Chicago]] is a fine art museum well known for its [[Impressionist]] and American art.
