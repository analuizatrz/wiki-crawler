'''''Love. Angel. Music. Baby.''''' is the debut solo album by [[United States|American]] [[pop music|pop]] singer [[Gwen Stefani]], released by [[Interscope Records]] in November 2004 (see [[2004 in music]]). The album originally began as a small side project for the [[No Doubt]] frontwoman, but grew into a large production with numerous collaborations and producers.

The album was designed as an updated version of an 1980s music record, and was influenced by artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam]], and [[Club Nouveau]]. Most of the songs on the record focus on fashion and wealth. The album introduced the "[[Harajuku Girls]]", four backup dancers who dress in Stefani's interpretation of the youth fashion trends of [[Harajuku]], a district in [[Tokyo]].

Despite gathering mostly positive reviews, ''L.A.M.B.'' received criticism for its many collaborations and superficial lyrical content. The album yielded six [[Single (music)|singles]] and had high sales, going [[multi-platinum]] in several countries, and selling seven million copies. It earned Stefani several [[Grammy Award]] nominations in 2005 and 2006.

==Conception and production==
During Stefani's time with [[No Doubt]], she began making solo appearances on albums by artists including [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Moby]], and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. In the production of its 2001 album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'', No Doubt collaborated with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[The Neptunes]], and [[David A. Stewart]] on different songs and had [[Mark "Spike" Stent]] [[audio mixing|mix]] the album. While the band was on tour to promote the album, Stefani listened to [[Club Nouveau]]'s 1987 single "[[Why You Treat Me So Bad]]" and considered recording material that modernized 1980s music.<ref name="scared">Vineyard, Jennifer.

Stefani resumed work with Linda Perry, who invited [[Dallas Austin]], and many other artists, including [[OutKast]]'s [[André 3000]], The Neptunes, and [[Dr. Dre]].<ref name="scared"/> Stefani announced the album's release in early 2004,<ref>Orshoski, Wes.

Many reviewers focused on the album's light lyrical themes. ''Entertainment Weekly'' called the references to Stefani's clothing line "shameless" and stated that "each song becomes akin to a pricey retro fashion blurb",<ref name="EW"/> and Pitchfork Media said that "the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s free-money parade through [[Gotham City]] was a much more entertaining display of wealth, and he had Prince, not just [[Wendy & Lisa]]."<ref name="pitchfork"/> ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' magazine stated that the album's "fashion fetish … gives the album a sense of thematic cohesiveness" but that the "obsession with Harajuku girls borders on maniacal".<ref name="slant"/> ''The Guardian'' disagreed with this perspective, arguing that "her affinity with [[Japanese pop culture]] … yields a synthetic sheen…that works well with the other point of reference, hip-hop."<ref name="guardian"/>

The success of the album's urban contemporary-oriented songs in the [[adult contemporary]] market allowed for the success of other artists while Stefani was pregnant and later recording ''The Sweet Escape''.
