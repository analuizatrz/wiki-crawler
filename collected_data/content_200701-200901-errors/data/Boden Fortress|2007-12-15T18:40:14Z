'''Boden Fortress''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Bodens fästning'') is a modern [[fortification|fortress]] consisting of several major and minor forts and fortifications surrounding the city of [[Boden, Sweden|Boden]], [[Norrbotten]], in northern [[Sweden]]. Although the main forts were finished in 1908, many of the supporting fortifications were not completed until the start of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Improvements were also continuously made during, and between, both [[World War]]s.  The fortress was originally intended to stop or delay attacks from the east or coastal assaults, which at the time of construction meant [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] attacks launched from [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]]. It was primarily the expansion of the railway net in [[Norrland]], which in turn was a consequence of the rising importance of the northern iron ore fields, that led to the increased strategic value of northern Sweden and the construction of the fortress.

Boden Fortress is made up of five primary self-supporting forts excavated out of the [[bedrock]] in five of the mountains surrounding Boden: Degerberget, Mjösjöberget, Gammelängsberget, Södra Åberget and Rödberget. Eight fortified secondary [[artillery]] positions were constructed between the forts to give flanking support and to cover areas not in range of the main forts' artillery. In addition, 40 [[bunker]]s for infantry, along with dugouts and other fortifications, were built to cover even more terrain. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] many [[anti-tank]] gun emplacements and additional bunkers and shelters were built, and tens of kilometers of [[dragon's teeth (fortification)|dragon's teeth]] were placed around the fortress and the city itself. Owing to the end of the Cold War and the reduction of the threat from the [[Soviet Union]], Boden Fortress became less important to the defence of Sweden, and began to be [[decommissioning|decommissioned]]. The last fort of the complex was [[decommissioning|decommissioned]] on [[31 December]] [[1998]].

== Background ==
=== Central and peripheral defence ===
[[Image:Swedishcentraldefence.png|thumb|A map of the theoretical Swedish [[central defence (strategy)|central defence]] system discussed and planned in the later part of the 19th century, the three proposed main fortresses marked with stars, and probable [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] directions of attack marked with arrows. Larger cities and towns mentioned in the text are also included.]]

The two dominating theories of how to use fortifications in the [[military strategy|strategic]] perspective during the 18th and 19th century were the central fortress system (''centrala fästningssystemet'') and the peripheral fortress system (''perifera fästningssystemet''), the latter also called the cordon system. The two systems were also known as [[central defence (strategy)|central defence]] and [[peripheral defence]]. The peripheral defence theory was based on building several smaller fortifications along the coast and borders of the country to meet the enemy at an early stage, while the central defence theory was meant to step by step weaken the enemy in minor [[skirmish]]es and [[ambush]]es carried out by forces supplied and supported by central fortresses not located in the [[front line]]. In short words, one theory advocated many minor fortifications built to directly engage the enemy, while the other advocated only a few major fortifications built not to directly engage the enemy, but to support the troops doing the engaging.

In the beginning of the 19th century the peripheral system&mdash;at least in Sweden&mdash;was deemed unmodern,<ref name="nystrom31">Nyström, p. 31.</ref> possibly due to the extremely long border and coastline of the country, which required a lot of personnel to maintain and support, leading to high costs. The peripheral system was also meant to contain the enemy to a specific area, the coast and borders, but as time went and new tactics were taken into practice, the thin line of fortifications would be easily penetrated by the enemy forces, and when the enemy had advanced through the peripheral line, there was nothing there to stop the attacker. The central fortress system was better adjusted to [[defence in depth]], it was not until the enemy attack had reached its [[culminating point]] that full [[counterattack]]s would be launched. The central defence had also proven effective in the [[Seven Years' War]]&mdash;used by [[Frederick II of Prussia]]&mdash;and in [[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia]]&mdash;used by the [[Imperial Russia|Russians]].<ref name="nystrom32">Nyström, p. 32.</ref> [[Carl von Clausewitz]], in his military treatise ''[[On War]]'', even mentioned Sweden's good conditions for this kind of [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]:

<blockquote>The fourth principle, the ''Assistance of the [[theater (warfare)|Theatre of War]]'', is naturally an advantage on the side of the defensive. [...] the army on the defensive continues to keep up its connection with everything, that is, it enjoys the support of its fortresses, is not weakened in any way, and is near to its sources of supply. [...] The [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|campaign of 1812]], gives as it were in a magnifying glass a very clear illustration of the effect of the means specified under principles 3 and 4. [...] It is true that with the exception of Sweden there is no country in Europe which is situated like Russia, but the efficient principle is always the same, the only distinction being in the greater or less degree of its strength.<ref name="clausewitz">Clausewitz, [http://www.clausewitz.com/CWZHOME/VomKriege2/BK6ch03.html book VI, chapter III].</ref></blockquote>

=== Fortification of Sweden ===
Sweden had just lost one third of its mainland, as Russia had conquered the eastern part and created the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] out of it during the [[Finnish War]] in 1808&ndash;1809. Shortly after, in 1814, the west flank had been secured by the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union with Norway]], and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the former main enemy of Sweden in the south, [[Denmark]], was no longer any threat. The only threat left was Russia, now standing just across the border in the north, and having possession of the [[Åland|Åland Islands]], less than 150&nbsp;km from the Swedish capital [[Stockholm]]. The [[Swedish Navy]] was considered superior to the Russian in the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], so a seaborne invasion against the coast of [[Norrland]] was not likely to happen. And even though the Russians had invaded northern Sweden via Finland in the previous war, the general opinion was that in case of a new war, their main attack would be conducted towards Stockholm and southern Sweden.<ref name="nystrom3233">Nyström, pp. 32&ndash;33.</ref>

[[Image:Johanpeterlefren.png|thumb|left|[[Johan Peter Lefrén]], [[general]], [[military]] theorist and [[secretary]] of the Swedish Fortification Committee of 1819.]]

This opinion led to the thought of finding a good rear defence area where the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] and the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] could move if the capital was in danger. This in turn naturally strengthened the central defence theory. The core land (''kärnlandet'') would be the place from where the main part of the field army would conduct its operations, supported by a few fortresses. The area between the two large lakes of [[Vänern]] and [[Vättern]] was the choice for this core land, having approximately the same border as [[Skaraborg County]]. Sweden above the province of [[Dalarna]] was not even considered to be included in this strategy.<ref name="nystrom34">Nyström, p. 34.</ref> The realisation of the middle Sweden central defence system was finally made [[5 February]] [[1819]] when King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Charles XIV John]] decided that one main fortress, the central fortress, and two smaller "operational fortresses" were to be built. The central fortress became [[Karlsborg Fortress]] at [[Karlsborg]], while the two operational fortresses meant to be located at either end of Vättern never were built due to lack of funds.

While [[Norrland]] was not supposed to be included in the central defence strategy, studies on how to defend this major part of the country were still conducted. However northern Sweden was generally considered to be a wasteland and not suited for larger military operations. The bad state of most of the roads, the many uninhabited areas, the large rivers and the very limited economical gain that the lands provided were a few of the reasons that led to Norrland being considered of very limited military interest.<ref name="nystrom36">Nyström, p. 36.</ref> The first of these studies, laid down by the Fortification Committee of 1819 (''1819 års befästningskommitté'')&mdash;which was largely influenced by the committee's [[secretary]] [[Johan Peter Lefrén]]<ref name="nystrom37">Nyström, p. 37.</ref>&mdash;led to nothing more than the opinion that the many large rivers up north&mdash;especially the [[Ångerman River]]&mdash;would benefit the defence and that no major fortifications were to be built. In another study from 1824, [[colonel]]&mdash;and much later [[Minister for Defence (Sweden)|Swedish Minister for War]]&mdash;[[Gustaf Oscar Peyron]] suggested that it would be better to fortify positions just south of Boden&mdash;along the more northern [[Lule River]]&mdash;for example at Sävast or Avan.<ref name="nfuboden">NF: uggleupplagan, [http://runeberg.org/nfbc/0463.html "Boden"].</ref> However no major changes were made, partially due to the limited military interest, but also because of the large amounts of money that was spent on building Karlsborg Fortress and modernizing other older fortifications in southern Sweden.<ref name="kartaschew12">Kartaschew, [http://www.sfv.se/cms/showdocument/documents/sfv/kulturvarden/2000_03/bodens_fastning.pdf p. 12].</ref>

=== Railroads speed up planning ===

It was not until fifteen year later, when yet another committee&mdash;the Coastal Fortification Committee of 1839 (''1839 års kustbefästningskommitté'')&mdash;studied the defence of Norrland, that the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] started to focus a bit more on the northern provinces.<ref name="kartaschew12">Kartaschew, p. 12.</ref> This study however mainly presented plans for middle Norrland, and the provinces of [[Medelpad]], [[Ångermanland]] and [[Jämtland]]. Those provinces had a more significant role as it was there that the main roads of Sweden started to intersect with the road network of [[Norway]], which at the time was allied with Sweden. The road network north of this area consisted of the large coastal road&mdash;the only major [[north]]&ndash;[[south]] road&mdash;from [[Haparanda]] and all the way through Norrland down to [[Gävle]]. All the other major roads exclusively had a [[Ordinal directions|southeast]]&ndash;[[Ordinal directions|northwest]] stretch&mdash;following the run of the large rivers&mdash;before ending up in nowhere and thus not providing any route further west into Norway and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast.<ref name="nystrom37">Nyström, p. 37.</ref> The plans to strengthen Norrland by building a central fortress either on [[Frösön]] outside [[Östersund]], or closer to the coast at [[Borgsjö]] outside [[Ånge]], once again fell flat due to lack of money and lower priority compared to fortifications in southern Sweden.

[[Image:Axel Rappe Jr.png|thumb|left|[[Axel Rappe (born 1838)|Axel Rappe]], chief of the Swedish General Staff 1882&ndash;1892 and 1899&ndash;1905, [[Minister for Defence (Sweden)|Swedish Minister for War]] 1892&ndash;1899, and the spiritual father of Boden Fortress.]]

By the 1860s, the first [[Rail transport in Sweden|Swedish railway]] trunk lines (''stambanor'') were completed in the southern part of the country, and by 1881 the trunk line through Norrland had reached Ånge. This, and the opening of the railway line connecting [[Sundsvall]]&ndash;[[Östersund]]&ndash;[[Trondheim]] four years later strengthened the plans for a defensive line in the middlemost provinces of Norrland.<ref name="nystrom4344">Nyström, pp. 43&ndash;44.</ref> At the same time, on the other side of the Bothnian Gulf, the Finnish main railway to [[Oulu]] had almost been completed, and would soon be of great use for the Russians to transport military personnel and supplies towards the Swedish border in case of war. Combined with the planned [[Luleå]]&ndash;Boden&ndash;[[Gällivare]]&ndash;[[Kiruna]]&ndash;[[Narvik]] railway line, this would pose a great opportunity for the Russians to fulfill their latent wish to seize control of northern [[Scandinavia]] and the Atlantic ports on the Norwegian coast. At least according to some officers&mdash;both Swedish and Norwegian&mdash;which in the second half of the 1880s noticed the increased strategic importance of northern Scandinavia and [[Lapland]] as an effect of the construction of the railway lines in the area.<ref name="nystrom4142">Nyström, pp. 41&ndash;42 & p. 53.</ref> The length of the railway lines started to affect strategic planning, and in some cases military decisions influenced the planning of new railway lines.

Even though the northernmost stretch of the trunk line in Norrland had long been planned, it was not until 1887 and the victory of the [[protectionism|protectionists]] in that year's election that the financial means and the political will allowed the completion of the railway through Överluleå, which Boden was sometimes called. The "slumbering resources and the rapid expansion"<ref name="nystrom44">Nyström, p. 44.</ref> in Upper Norrland were two reasons to build a railway to the sparsely populated area; another factor that had a big part in the decision to complete the northern trunk line was the government's takeover of the Luleå&ndash;Gällivare line which had previously been in the hands of an [[England|English]] company. The stretch was very lucrative, as it considerably eased the transport of [[iron ore]] from the ore fields around Kiruna and Gällivare down to the coast for further transport by boat. Another English company had in the 1860s tried to construct a combination of a railway and a canal&mdash;the [[English Canal]]&mdash;for the stretch, but went bankrupt before completing their plans. The company contracted for the new railway line experienced similar economic difficulties and the Swedish state decided to buy the nearly completed line to finish it in 1891.<ref name="nystrom4546">Nyström, pp. 45&ndash;46.</ref>

The decision to complete the railway through to Boden sparked interest in [[Norrbotten]] among the members of the Swedish General Staff, and the chief, [[Axel Rappe (born 1838)|Axel Rappe]], conducted a survey trip to the region in 1887. His report mentioned the changed strategic options due to the railway lines on both sides of the Gulf and a need for some kind of fortification in Boden, but he also toned down the earlier thoughts on the Russian interest in the Luleå&ndash;Narvik line. Rappe's report directly affected the future stretch of the railway line in Norrbotten. His recommendations, largely based on his and the General Staff's military planning, not to build the line along the coast, or build it all the way to the Swedish-Finnish border at Haparanda were later followed. The subsequent report completed in 1890 by the Neutrality Committee of 1888 (''1888 års neutralitetskommitté'')&mdash;with Axel Rappe as one of its members&mdash;proposed a budget of 1.3 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]], corresponding in today's money to around 9 million [[United States dollar|USD]]<ref name="statsweden">Statistics Sweden, [http://www.scb.se/templates/tableOrChart____33838.asp Price level in Sweden 1830-2005].</ref> for the construction of permanent fortifications in Boden.<ref name="nystrom59">Nyström, p. 59.</ref>

The following year, in 1892, Rappe wrote a memorandum that explained in more detail the budget, which suddenly had risen to 4.5 million SEK, and would finance the construction of two strongpoints at Paglaberget and Åberget (see map) with a total of six long [[cannon]], ten [[howitzer]]s and eight [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] cannon, all in armoured [[gun turret|turrets]], along with several [[machine gun]]s and bunkers, [[barracks]] and supply depots. The plan included a reserve battalion of 1,000 men, an artillery battalion of 600 men, an engineer company of 120 men, and supply and depot personnel.<ref name="nystrom59" /> Axel Rappe's large study on the permanent fortifications of Sweden (named ''Underdånigt betänkande angående Sveriges fasta försvar'') was published in 1892 and cemented the view that a central fortress was needed in Boden to support and supply troops gathering between the Lule River and the eastern border.

Although Rappe did not completely rule out the possibility of a [[German Empire|German]] or [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] attack on southern Sweden if the opportunity arose, he felt that Russia was the most realistic threat.<ref name="nordhagenottosen56">Nordhagen Ottosen, [http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/forskning/forskningsprosjekter/1905/publikasjon/ottosen.pdf p. 56].</ref> There were only two plausible cases of war against them, either Sweden got involved in a war between Germany and Russia which would feature southern and central Sweden as the battleground—and Rappe made no attempt to hide which country the General Staff wanted Sweden to side with in that case—or Russia would make a limited attack on Norrbotten to reach northern Norway and the Atlantic—an attack he earlier said was not very likely. Rappe probably said that to get more focus on the importance of the railway line to Boden, which was under discussion at that time, and he thus hoped that it would speed up its completion.<ref name="nystrom60">Nyström, p. 60.</ref> A railway line to Boden was of utmost need to be able to bring up troops to Lule River&mdash;the main line of defence&mdash;and a future fortress there.

During the following years a fierce debate raged between the supporters of the army on one side and the navy on the other. The proposed expansion of several of the Swedish fortifications, which in turn would see less money spent on the fleet, upset many naval proponents, amongst them [[Wilhelm Dyrssen]]&mdash;later [[Minister for Defence (Sweden)|Minister for Defence]]&mdash;and [[Herman Wrangel (born 1859)|Herman Wrangel]], but also [[Fredrik von Otter]]&mdash;later [[Admiral (Sweden)|Admiral]] and [[Prime Minister of Sweden]].<ref name="nystrom6364">Nyström, pp. 63&ndash;64.</ref> They argued that the theory of central defence would leave large swaths of Swedish land in the hands of the enemy, and instead suggested several smaller fortifications at the border, along with a strengthened navy.<ref name="nordhagenottosen98">Nordhagen Ottosen, [http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/forskning/forskningsprosjekter/1905/publikasjon/ottosen.pdf p. 98].</ref> The debate was inconclusive and a request for 500,000 SEK to initiate construction of the fortress was not accepted by the government. Instead, they wanted a committee to further investigate all Swedish fortifications and possible new constructions of such. Thus the Fortification Committee of 1897 was formed. The committee, led by chairman [[Jesper Crusebjörn]], discussed and examined the defence of Norrland very thoroughly, which included a travel to Boden and climbing several of the heights and mountains that were considered for the fortifications.<ref name="bergmark526527">Even the chairman which&mdash;according to assistant secretary Melander&mdash;had "a pretty extensive corpus to carry around, did not fear toil and in own person climbed, even though slowly, the highest of all the mountains." Bergmark, pp. 526&ndash;527.</ref> The selection of Boden as the most suitable place for the fortification, according to the committee's final report published [[July 25]], [[1898]], had several reasons:
*The rail trunk line through Norrland crossed [[Lule River]] there.
*The intersection of the trunk line and the [[Luleå]]&ndash;[[Narvik]] line was located there.
*The most important road intersection in Norrbotten was located there.
*The most suitable river crossing sites over Lule River were located there.
*The distance to the coast was long enough to prevent a surprise attack by a naval landing force.
*The [[topography]] of the area was suitable for a modern fortress.<ref name="kartaschew3">Kartaschew, [http://www.sfv.se/cms/showdocument/documents/sfv/vara_fastigheter/Tidningen_340.pdf p. 3].</ref><ref name="nystrom104">Nyström, p. 104.</ref>

=== Final decision ===
[[Image:Rodbergproposal.png|thumb|A 1903 proposal for how the fort at Röderberget could look. Prominent features include the four armoured [[gun turret|turrets]] for 15&nbsp;cm [[howitzer]]s, and the deep [[caponier]] [[ditch]] around the fort.]]

The report calculated the costs to 8.7 million SEK&mdash;the same sum that Axel Rappe had proposed in 1896&mdash;which corresponds in today's money to around 60 million USD,<ref name="statsweden" /> spent over a total construction schedule of one four-year period and two three-year periods. The cost was still considerably lower than that of many of the recently built or modernised fortifications on the [[Continental Europe|continent]]; [[Belgium]] had spent the equivalent of 62 million SEK on fortifications along the [[Meuse River|Meuse]], and [[Romania]] had spent around the same to strengthen the defence of [[Bucharest]].<ref name="bergmark519">Bergmark, p. 519.</ref> In 1899, Rappe proposed to the Swedish [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]]&mdash;in line with the plans of the Fortification Committee&mdash;that construction of already existing fortificatory works in Sweden would commence, while the question on Boden would be postponed to the next year. Gaining support from the first chamber but not from the second chamber, the joint vote decided, and the result was in favor of the proposition. Even though the result did not really mean anything concrete for the possible construction in Boden, many considered this a great success for that question as well.<ref name="nystrom6970">Nyström, pp. 69&ndash;70.</ref> During the last years of the century, the Riksdag's general attitude towards the army became more positive, most likely due to the increased [[Russification of Finland]], increased tension in the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Union]], and rumors that the Russian [[sawfiler]]s working in Sweden also worked for the [[Okhrana]], the secret Russian police.

[[Image:E G Boström from Hildebrand Sveriges historia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Erik Gustaf Boström]], [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] at the time of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]]'s decision to construct Boden Fortress.]]

Despite this progress, Axel Rappe left as Minister for War in 1899, due to a number of setbacks on other issues. He was replaced by [[Jesper Crusebjörn]], who inherited the Boden fortification project.<ref name="nystrom6970" /> Following in the footsteps of Rappe&mdash;who was later referred to as "the spiritual father of Boden Fortress"<ref name="nystrom51">Nyström, p. 51.</ref>&mdash; Crusebjörn proposed, in accordance with the Committee's plan, that the Riksdag should allocate an initial sum of 560,000 SEK<ref name="560vs260">According to Bergmark, p. 528. In Nyström, p. 70 the sum 260,000 SEK is instead mentioned.</ref> which would be used to initiate construction of Boden Fortress. Crusebjörn also maintained the belief of his predecessor, and of the committee in which he was chairman, that Boden Fortress when completed should act as the operational base for all troops attached for the defence of Norrbotten, that it should serve as a supply fortress for troops stationed between it and the front line, and that it also should serve as a blocking fortress in case of a Russian surprise attack. The 1897 committee also had set the goal to have Boden Fortress in a finished state when the trunk line through railway found its way through to the border against Finland.<ref name="bergmark527">Bergmark, p. 527.</ref>

The result of the votes&mdash;held [[May 7]], [[1900]],<ref name="nystrom79">Nyström, p. 79.</ref> a date which can be seen as the birth of the fortress&mdash;in the first and second chambers were the same as the previous year. The result in the first chamber was overwhelmingly for the proposal at 108&ndash;16, but the proponents feared a defeat in the second chamber. During the debate both the [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] [[Erik Gustaf Boström]] and Jesper Crusebjörn threatened to resign from their posts if the proposal was not accepted, to exert pressure on the second chamber. Boström expressed the following that day:

<blockquote>For believe me gentlemen, I consider this question so important that in the same moment I get the definite answer that it is not embraced by the Swedish Riksdag, I will no longer stay in this place.<ref name="bergmark528">Bergmark, p. 528.</ref></blockquote>

Even after this, the second chamber voted against the proposal, with a vote count of 73&ndash;130. Neither Boström nor Crusebjörn resigned, since after further discussion and voting it was decided that the matter should be settled by a joint vote. The first chamber voted in favor, 125&ndash;14, while the second chamber voted against, 87&ndash;135, with a total outcome of 212&ndash;149 in favour of constructing Boden Fortress and allocating the funds needed to start construction. Funding for the purchase of the land that the fortifications were to be built on had largely been provided several years in advance by two voluntary organizations. The Organization for the Fortified Defence of Upper Norrland (''Föreningen för Övre Norrlands fasta försvar'') and the Swedish Women's Organization (''Svenska Qvinnoföreningen'') had collected 71,000 SEK out of the 131,000 SEK needed for land purchase.<ref name="bergmark532">Bergmark, p. 532.</ref><ref name="nf1boden">NF: första utgåvan, [http://runeberg.org/nfas/0484.html "Supplement Boden"].</ref>

== Construction ==
=== Initial work ===
[[Image:Boden Fortress workers.jpg|thumb|left|Workers taking a break from their blasting duties during construction of one of the forts.]]

The main inspiration for the design of the forts&mdash;being blasted into the mountains rather than constructed on top of them&mdash;came from [[Vaberget Fortress]] near [[Karlsborg Fortress]]. Vaberget Fortress was built in the 1890s and its southern fort was the first fort in the world that fully used the protection provided by the bedrock itself by having all of its functions embedded in the mountain.<ref name="svensson19">Svensson, [http://www.sfv.se/cms/showdocument/documents/sfv/kulturvarden/2000_01/var_forsta_moderna_befastning.pdf p. 19].</ref> Vaberget Fortress served as a prototype for Boden Fortress and many more future fortifications in Sweden, including the late 20th century fixed army and coastal artillery batteries that gave the [[Swedish Fortifications Administration]] world renown.<ref name="kartaschew1">Kartaschew, [http://www.sfv.se/cms/showdocument/documents/sfv/vara_fastigheter/Tidningen_340.pdf p. 1].</ref> Preparatory work was started in 1900 and consisted of a diverse number of tasks, ranging from purchase of beds for the construction workers, construction of a new loading site for the railway, building roads to the various construction sites and clearing the land of those sites. The plan for the Fortifications at Boden (''Befästningarna vid Boden'')&mdash;which was the term used until the [[World War I|First World War]] when the present name Boden Fortress came into widespread use<ref name="nystrom126127">Nyström, pp. 126&ndash;127.</ref>&mdash;was largely based on the proposal laid forward by the Fortification Committee of 1897, with only minor modifications.

[[Image:Rodbergsfortet - Ditch 1.jpg|thumb|A view down a [[ditch]] at one of the forts. Equipment used during the construction can be seen. The picture below is a closeup of what is located at the far end of this ditch.]]

Already before any construction work had started, the cost of the forts had been estimated to exceed the previous calculations by 50&nbsp;% and in December 1901, only few months after the first blasting work that had been done at Gammelängsberget in July 1901, the cost for the four forts northeast of the river was expected to be 65&nbsp;% more expensive than the initial calculation.<ref name="nystrom157">Nyström, p. 157.</ref> The blueprints of the forts at Degerberget, Gammelängsberget and Södra Åberget were the first to be confirmed, which happened on [[11 May]] [[1901]]. The fort at Mjösjöberget followed suit on [[3 April]] [[1902]] and the last fort to get a confirmed blueprint was the fort at Rödberget, on [[19 May]] [[1903]]. The last proposed fort, at Paglaberget, was deleted from the plans in 1906&mdash;along with the batteries at Fällberget and Slumpberget as well as the fortifications at Avan and Svartbyträsket&mdash;before any work on the fort had started, due to the proposal of the new Fortification Committee of 1905, which was formed following the reports of the large rise in costs.<ref name="nystrom166">Nyström, p. 166.</ref> On [[9 February]] [[1906]], the current Minister for War [[Lars Tingsten]] calculated the total cost to end at 19,220,000 SEK, more than twice the cost reported by the 1897 committee.<ref name="bergmark533">Bergmark, p. 533.</ref>

All work on the large masses of bedrock was conducted by hand, without any help of powered machines. The first work that was done at the site was to create a large [[ditch]], 9&ndash;12&nbsp;m wide and width a depth of 6&nbsp;m or more, that would surround the core of the fort. Creating patrol trenches and placements for the turrets on the top of the forts was also work done early on. The teams of workers would first [[boring (mechanical)|bore]] down in the bedrock using pinch bars and sledgehammers, then use [[dynamite]] to blast the rock into manageable pieces which could be transported away from the site, using wheelbarrows, horse-drawn carriages and in some cases [[Decauville]] railways. When the ditch, or parts of it, had been completed, work started on the inner part of the fort by boring horizontally from the bottom of the ditch into the mountain itself. This work was a lot harder&mdash;the cost for each [[cubic metre]] of blasted tunnel was five times the cost of a cubic metre of blasted ditch&mdash;both due to the confined space in the tunnels and the risk of damaging the bedrock. Dynamite was replaced by [[black powder]] which reduced the risk of doing so but it also increased the time needed to complete the tunnels.<ref name="nystrom158160">Nyström, pp. 158&ndash;160.</ref> All in all, the amount of bedrock bored, blasted, loaded and transported away from the forts has been estimated to be between 250,000&nbsp;m³ and 350,000&nbsp;m³.<ref name="bedrockvolume">Nyström, p. 329 gives the number 241,000&nbsp;m³, while Lidström, [http://www.forsvarsutbildarna.se/index.php?dispatchTo=Renderer&action=download&file=11866 p. 4] mentions 350,000&nbsp;m³.</ref>

=== Finishing touch ===
[[Image:Rodbergsfortet - Caponier.jpg|thumb|left|One of the [[counterscarp]] galleries at Rödberget Fort. Several 57&nbsp;mm [[caponier]] [[cannon]] (''kaponjärkanoner'') and [[machine gun]]s were stationed behind the green armoured hatches, ready to fire at any intruder in the ditch.]]

When the ditches and tunnels were finished, concrete works started, including flooring, construction of joist systems if a second floor inside the fort was wanted, staircases, partition walls and [[counterscarp]] galleries. [[Water well]]s were bored to a depth of several hundred meters to guarantee water supply since the forts were supposed to be self-supporting.<ref name="bergmark536">Bergmark, p. 536.</ref> However, the most demanding part of the project was the construction, transport and installation of the armoured turrets and the armament itself. Two companies had been previously contracted for the construction of other fortifications in Sweden, Swedish [[Bofors|AB Bofors-Gullspång]] and [[France|French]] [[Compagnie des Forges de Châtillon]], offers from both companies existed already in 1901, but it was not until after tests conducted in December 1902 that the Swedish company was contracted and given royal approval on [[26 May]] [[1903]]. The order was for the 8.4&nbsp;cm and 12&nbsp;cm pieces that was to be mounted on the first three forts. The following two forts at Rödberget and Mjösjöberget were to have 15&nbsp;cm pieces, an order Bofors would get as well, but due to the time factor a few of those were actually delivered by the French company.<ref name="nystrom161163">Nyström, pp. 161&ndash;163.</ref>

[[Image:Boden Fortress turret transport.jpg|thumb|Horse and [[sleigh]] was used to transport the [[gun turret|turrets]] to their final destinations.]]

The cost of a single armoured turret for a 12&nbsp;cm piece was almost 100,000 SEK&mdash;around 700,000 USD in today's money<ref name="statsweden" />&mdash;and it could weigh as much as 100 [[tonne]]s. It was delivered in parts to simplify transport, but the heaviest part still had a weight of 26 tonnes. The parts were delivered by rail up to Boden and unloaded with the help of [[gantry crane]]s. As the roads of the time could not handle the weight during summer, transport had to wait until winter when the [[frost]] had hardened the ground. The turret parts were lifted onto [[sleigh]]s drawn by 16&ndash;30 horses depending on the situation. The toughest stretch, up the mountain, was handled with the help of [[block and tackle]], the ditch was crossed on temporarily built sturdy wooden bridges and the mounting of the turret was finished with cranes. A major part of the mounts for the turrets were completed by the end of 1905, despite the harsh winter working conditions, with temperatures falling below −40 [[Celsius|°C]] from time to time.<ref name="nystrom164165">Nyström, pp. 164&ndash;165.</ref> The peak workforce amounted to around 900 men,<ref name="workforce">According to Nyström, p. 167 and Bergmark, p. 534. Fästningsguiden i Norr AB, [http://www.rodbergsfortet.com/ Bodens fästning & Rödbergsfortet] gives a slightly higher number of 1,200 men.</ref> but was fluctuating with the lowest number of active workers during the winter months. The first artillery test firing was conducted on [[15 January]] [[1907]] when the guns at Gammelängsberget fired their first rounds,<ref name="bergmark536" /> and all five forts "were in a defensible state" by 1908.<ref name="nystrom168">Nyström, p. 168.</ref>

=== Other fortificatory works ===
[[Image:Rodbergsfortet - Bunker.jpg|thumb|One of many concrete [[bunker]]s built all around Boden, this one is located on the west slope of Rödberget. Only a short part of the so called "sausage" and some of its rifle [[embrasure|loophole]]s can be seen here, this particular bunker is about 50&nbsp;m long in total.]]

Apart from the forts, the garrison itself was heavily expanded during the initial construction years and became one of the largest garrisons in Sweden, still at the start of the 21st century Boden was the largest garrison city in the [[Swedish Army]]. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves were finished by 1908, and work now started to fill the holes in between them. It was realized that prepared positions were needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called ''fästen'', strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and were finished during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned in the mountain itself with embrasures in the mountain side,<ref name="svedjefort">The battery on Svedjeberget is often referred to as a fort&mdash;especially in post-decommission promotional and tourist material&mdash;but that is incorrect, see for example Kartaschew, [http://www.sfv.se/cms/showdocument/documents/sfv/vara_fastigheter/Tidningen_340.pdf pp. 4&ndash;6].</ref> and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outside&mdash;the other positions were concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside a [[bunker]], and others behind a [[parapet]].

The main fortifications for infantry consisted of 44 concrete bunkers, 23 dugouts and 26 fortified observation posts.<ref name="exhibition">Boden Fortress exhibition.</ref> The concrete bunkers (''infanteriskansar'', redoubts) were long and narrow, the longest, Abramsskansen, was 155&nbsp;m long and had room for 160 men and four machine guns, but most had room for less than 80 men&mdash;usually a rifle [[platoon]] reinforced with a machine gun [[section (military unit)|section]] and an anti-tank section.<ref name="digmaps">Dig Maps AB, [http://www.bodenkartan.com/bodfastningkarta.htm Bodens fästnings karta].</ref> Due to their length, their curved shapes following the mountain sides, and other characteristics, the bunkers were popularly referred to as "sausages" (''korvar''). The construction of these started in 1911. Many officers still considered the fortress to have inadequate and to few fortifications for the infantry, and one officer compared the fortress to "a shoe, which is to large for the foot."<ref name="bergmark537">Bergmark, p. 537.</ref> 1 million SEK was allocated in 1915 to fix that problem, and many minor fortifications were built during the First World War. Blockhouses were also built by the railway bridge at Trångforsen and the&mdash;during 1911&ndash;1912 built&mdash;road bridge ''Hedenbron'' located just 1½ kilometres southeast of the Trångforsen bridge. The later was built to accommodate easier access to Rödberget Fort and the military training area on the southwestern shore of Lule River and was at the time of completion the longest single span road bridge in Sweden.<ref name="nystrom170171">Nyström, pp. 170&ndash;171.</ref>

[[Image:Boden airship.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] of the garrison, used for [[artillery observer|artillery observation]] and [[reconnaissance]], seen during an [[Military exercise|exercise]] in 1914.]]

Both internal and external communication systems as well as means of reconnaissance were needed, both directed by the [[commandant]] located in the headquarters building. The building&mdash;finished in 1910&mdash;had three floors, the upper two functioned as home and workplace for the commandant and the chief of staff, while the ground floor had extra thick walls and functioned as [[command post]] for the fortress.<ref name="nystrom168" /> A large field telephone network was built, connecting all forts with the headquarters. Liaison with higher commands was at first maintained by regular post, telegraph and telephone. The fortress' radio station was finished by 1914 and was located south of Degerberget on a [[bog]] now known as the "Radio Mire" (''Radiomyren''). The fortress also had [[homing pigeon]]s for sending [[Pigeon post|messages]]. At the end of the Second World War, around 280 such pigeons were stationed in Boden. The pigeons were part of the balloon department whose main task was to operate the [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] of the garrison. For this, a hangar with inner measurements of 35×10×10&nbsp;m was built near the radio station. More than fifty men were attached to the department, of which two could follow the balloon up to its maximum height of 1,000&nbsp;m, limited by the length of the wire connecting it to the ground. The hydrogen-filled balloon itself was of German make and measured 27&nbsp;m in length, had a diameter of around 7&nbsp;m and a total volume of 750&nbsp;m³.

=== Two World Wars ===

Most parts of the fortress were finished during the [[World War I|First World War]], and many minor works were started and completed during the course of the war. Even though [[Swedish neutrality|Sweden remained neutral]] [[Sweden during World War I|during the First]] and [[Sweden during World War II|Second World War]], the start and outcome of both had large impact on the fortress. [[Finland]] [[Finland's declaration of independence|declaring its indepencence]] during the First World War created a [[buffer state]] between Sweden and Imperial Russia's successor state, the [[Soviet Union]], which radically changed the strategic value of Northern Sweden, and questioned the usability of Boden Fortress. Only the most necessary needs were satisfied during the [[interwar period]], even apparent needs&mdash;based on the experiences from the war&mdash;such as better [[air defence]] and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by [[armoured warfare|armoured forces]] were neglected. Thanks to local commanders, construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones were done with the help of garrisoned troops. Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training, and the telephone network was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company. This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material.<ref name="nystrom178">Nyström, p. 178.</ref>

[[Image:Rodbergsfortet - Gustaf V.jpg|thumb|King [[Gustaf V]] put his autograph on one of the ditch walls of Rödberget Fort on [[16 July]] [[1921]].]]

Only a few necessary projects were funded, including an underground headquarters bunker, improvement of the garrison hospital and new training areas. It was not until the increased tension in Europe following [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Hitler's rise to power|rise to power]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]] and the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] that focus once again was put on military readiness and prepared fortifications. Several improvements were made to fortifications in many parts of Sweden during the last years of the 1930s following the [[Anschluss|German annexation of Austria]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupation of Czechoslovakia]]. In Boden, this included building underground storage rooms for ammunition and food, replenishing already existing stocks, increasing protection for other important supply functions&mdash;such as the waterworks&mdash;as well as further military planning and also preparations for destruction of&mdash;for an advancing enemy&mdash;important bridges and roads.<ref name="nystrom178179">Nyström, pp. 178&ndash;179.</ref>

These stones, placed there during the [[World War II|Second World War]] formed the southwesternmost line of defence of Boden Fortress.]]

When the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out, only limited resources where allotted to the defence of Northern Sweden, but following the [[Winter War|Soviet attack on Finland]] a few months later and the German [[Operation Weserübung]] against [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] the next year, major work on improving and extending the defensive lives was commenced. Many bunkers, bomb shelters, gun emplacements&mdash;particularly for anti-tank guns&mdash;were built by the units that had been mobilised and stationed in the vicinity of Boden. The Finnish experiences gained from meeting superior armoured forces during the Winter War were adopted in Sweden, and triple rows of large stones or blocks of reinforced concrete, [[dragon's teeth (fortification)|dragon's teeth]], soon formed a continuous line&mdash;defended by anti-tank guns in concrete bunkers and machine-gun nests&mdash;around the fortress and city. As the war continued and advances in most fields of warfare were made, Boden Fortress was continually improved to meet new or increased threats such as air, armoured or gas attacks. The command, supply and intelligence services were improved as well.<ref name="nystrom179182">Nyström, pp. 179&ndash;182.</ref>

As Sweden has remained neutral since 1816, Boden Fortress was never put to the test. Nonetheless, there are a few indications on how Boden, the garrison, the fortress and its crew would have come through a wartime attack. Already in 1904, Lars Tingsten&mdash;later Minister for War and also the first commander of Boden Fortress&mdash;expressed worries over the low number of soldiers that were planned to garrison the town. The 1892 army war plans had two infantry [[battalion]]s stationed in the area, and allowed for three or four more to be transferred there,<ref name="nystrom109">Nyström, p. 109.</ref> while Tingsten reported that the battalions should number at least 24 and perhaps even 33.<ref name="nystrom117118">Nyström, pp. 117&ndash;118.</ref> The lack of personnel, and even more the lack of organisation, was shown when the fortress was tested against a [[coup de main]] in April 1913. Led by its commander [[Bror Munck]], the cavalry regiment [[Kronprinsens husarregemente]] managed to seize control of the railway station, the railway bridge, the ordnance depot, the electric works and the waterworks in the matter of a day. When the unit reached the headquarters building, Lars Tingsten&mdash;now commandant of the fortress&mdash;saw his earlier worries come true.<ref name="bjorhammar3132">Björhammar, pp. 31&ndash;32.</ref><ref name="nystrom201202">Nyström, pp. 201&ndash;202.</ref> Despite this, the wartime infantry garrison was no more than four battalions in 1937. But as the Second World War came to its end, the fortress had been given a new role. It was no longer meant to stand on its own against a besiegeing enemy, and instead became only one piece in a larger network of fortifications.<ref name="nystrom132139">Nyström, pp. 132&ndash;139.</ref>

=== Espionage ===
[[Image:Russian sawfiler.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] [[sawfiler]] Peter Alexandrovich Boboshkin from [[Nizhny Novgorod]] [[Nizhny Novgorod Governorate|Governorate]] travelled through northern Sweden, from [[Kiruna]] to [[Hudiksvall]] in the spring of 1910, and passed through [[Boden Municipality|Boden]]. When this picture was taken in March that year (location unknown), he had placed his filing machine on military territory.]]

Strict secrecy surrounded the fortress for a very long time, and there were several attempts made by foreign powers to gain knowledge of various kinds of information. One early possible attempt at [[espionage]] were the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] [[sawfiler]]s who travelled through Sweden, mostly in Norrland during the last years of the 19th century and the years leading up to the [[First World War]]. A large part of the Swedish population believed that the sawfilers, no more than 300 in total in Sweden, were spies hired by the [[Okhrana]], the Russian secret police. While some sources are of the belief that the sawfilers were never sent out on specific missions&mdash;but instead acted as unknowing spies&mdash;only having contact with the Okhrana who interrogated them regarding their experiences when they returned to Russia,<ref name="nystrom89">Nyström, p. 89.</ref> other sources claim that at least some of the sawfilers that the Okhrana found most useful were educated in the art of espionage, and were in fact given specific missions, as well as being paid 300 [[Russian ruble|rouble]] per season for their work.<ref name="forsberg1415">Forsberg, pp. 14&ndash;15.</ref> Another form of this kind of legal espionage is believed to have been conducted by the [[Germany|German]] [[Wandervogel]] movement during the late interwar period.<ref name="nystrom88">Nyström, p. 88.</ref>

The first known attempt of purposeful espionage against the fortress was conducted in 1913&ndash;14. A former [[lieutenant]] in the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[coastal artillery]], A. B. Fredrikssen, was enlisted in [[Copenhagen]] by the Russian [[military attaché]] in [[Stockholm]], [[colonel]] Assanovitch. Fredrikssen was sent to Boden with the task to explore the fortress and its surroundings. He and his wife stayed at a [[boarding house]] in the city, and had regular correspondence with his employer who stayed in Copenhagen. It was also the correspondence that exposed the attempt, which was not very successful in terms of information gained by the Russians. They had better luck in late 1914 with two brothers named Hiukka, who both served with one of the artillery regiments in Boden, [[Norrlands artilleriregemente]]. They were discovered due to their extravagant living, and it was found out that one of the brothers&mdash;despite his employment in the army&mdash;had Finnish-Russian citizenship. They had provided intelligence to Russia, but the full extent of the affair was never disclosed.<ref name="nyström8687">Nyström, pp. 86&ndash;87.</ref> A minor case of German espionage was exposed during the Second World War. The first permanently stationed German officer in Luleå, a [[Hauptmann]] Schultz, was caught in the act photographing parts of the fortifications, and was deported. It is probable that his espionage was not ordered from any higher command, but was rather an act on own initiative.<ref name="gyllenhaal29">Gyllenhaal, p 29. In a private conversation with the author, he stated that it is likely that the officer's name was Schulte rather than Schultz, however it is not entirely clear which name is correct.</ref>

Two extensive espionage cases in Sweden during the [[Cold War]] involved Boden Fortress, both exposed in 1951. The first case involved [[Fritjof Enbom]], a former worker at the [[Statens Järnvägar|Swedish State Railways]] in Boden, and later as local editor for the [[communism|communist]] newspaper ''[[Flamman|Norrskensflamman]]''. He was exposed by his own careless talk&mdash;often under the influence of alcohol&mdash;to the owners of the house in [[Stockholm]] where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden. The family told the [[Swedish Security Service]] after the [[Christmas]] holidays of 1951, and Enbom was arrested on [[16 February]] [[1952]]. During interrogation, he confessed that he&mdash;from February 1943 to April 1951&mdash;had met with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] employers around 25 times. Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence, most of it from public sources, but also secrets, of which the armament of one of the forts in the fortress was one of many pieces of information that concerned Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications.<ref name="forsberg220224">Forsberg, pp. 220&ndash;224.</ref> He was sentenced to lifetime [[penal labour|hard labour]], but was released after ten years. The other case involved [[Ernst Hilding Andersson]], who was arrested on [[21 September]] [[1951]]. He had carried out seven missions for the Soviets and had provided them primarily with information regarding the [[Swedish Navy]], but also information on the fortifications along the Norrland coast, and an initiated report about Boden Fortress and the airforce unit located in Boden and Luleå, [[Norrbottens flygflottilj|Norrbottens flygbaskår]]. Andersson was, like Fritjof Enbom, sentenced to lifetime hard labour.<ref name="forsberg253254">Forsberg, pp. 253&ndash;254.</ref>

=== Cold War and myths ===

The fortress was gradually modernised in the decades following the Second World War, including newer main artillery for some of the forts and newer secondary artillery for all forts as well as other improvements. But the development of new weapons and the evolution of warfare during the [[Cold War]] gradually decreased the importance of the fortifications.<ref name="nystrom140">Nyström, p. 140.</ref> Weapons such as [[cruise missile]]s and [[precision-guided munition|smart bomb]]s dealt the death blow to Boden Fortress when they demonstrated their worth during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.<ref name="englund">Englund, [http://www.peterenglund.com/textarkiv/binladinboden.htm Om terroristskräcken i vårt land].</ref> Mjösjöberget Fort had been [[decommissioning|decommissioned]] and removed from the wartime organisation twelve years earlier in 1979,<ref name="mjosjodecommission">According to Fästningsguiden i Norr AB, [http://www.rodbergsfortet.com/historia.htm Kort historik om Bodens fästnings kärnanläggningar]. Dig Maps AB, [http://www.bodenkartan.com/bodfastningkarta.htm Bodens fästnings karta] says that Mjösjöberget Fort was removed from the wartime organisation one year earlier, in 1978.</ref> and less than ten years after the Gulf War and the [[history of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], the four other forts had followed suit. The last shot was fired from Rödberget on 14:11 local time on [[31 December]] [[1997]],<ref name="sistaskottet">Fästningsguiden i Norr AB, [http://rodbergsfortet.com/sistaskottet.htm Sista skotten från Rödbergsfortet].</ref> and exactly one year later, on [[31 December]] [[1998]], that last fort was decommissioned after 90 years in service.

All five forts and three battery positions&mdash;Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Södra Slumpberget&mdash;have been declared historic buildings and are to be preserved for the future. Two forts, Rödberget and Södra Åberget are held in operation, and the former is used as a [[tourist attraction]] with guided tours, and there is also a possibility for companies to hold smaller conferences inside the fort. Over 10,000 visitors were expected to visit Rödberget Fort in 2002, averaging 300 a day during the summer.<ref name="pm">PM, Turistmålet som skulle stoppa ryssen.</ref><ref name="hagerfors">Hagerfors, [http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=39046 Topphemlig fästning blev turistmål].</ref> Boden Fortress is also still one of the [[salute]] batteries of Sweden, which fire a [[21-gun salute]] at special occasions such as the [[National holiday of Sweden]] and birthdays of some members of the [[Swedish Royal Family]]. The fortress was made a salute battery on [[2 June]] [[1931]], but since the forts have been decommissioned, the salute is now fired with four cannon located at Kvarnängen in central Boden.<ref name="gallin">Gallin, [http://www.boden.se/db/web/external.nsf/0/8E6D25EDF6838DA6C12570C20053C165?OpenDocument Bodens salutstation].</ref>

[[Image:Rodbergsfortet - Top 2.jpg|thumb|Looking southwest from Rödberget Fort, silhouettes of the [[SSAB]] [[steel mill|steelworks]] and other industries in [[Luleå]] some 30&nbsp;km away can be seen.]]

Due to the strict security surrounding the garrison, many rumors circulated during the fortress' lifetime, some were later dismissed as myths or as disinformation, but others were confirmed. One common rumor was that the artillery of the main forts had a range of fire that made it possible to shoot at the important [[Luleå]] harbour more than 40&nbsp;km away, but in reality, the maximum range of the farthest shooting pieces was less than half.<ref name="anundby">Anundby, [http://www.nsd.se/artikel.aspx?artid=28219 Många myter om fortet].</ref> Another widespread myth was that all the forts were connected to each other with a complex system of tunnels beneath the city. A rumor that on the other hand has been confirmed, is that the forts were used as storage for a large part of the Swedish [[official gold reserves|gold reserve]]. Around a third of the total Swedish gold holdings of 280&nbsp;[[tonnes]] was kept in Degerberget Fort from 1941&mdash;transported there disguised as boxes of ammunition&mdash;until the last [[ingot]]s were brought from the fort by six [[armored car|armoured cars]] in 1982.<ref name="anundby" />

The total cost of the project&mdash;somewhere around 20 million SEK at the time&mdash;would correspond to around 800 million SEK today according to the consumer price index which the government agency [[Statistics Sweden]] uses.<ref name="statsweden" /> Despite this, the cost has been claimed to correspond to 4 billion SEK of today,<ref name="rade">Råde, Sveriges hemliga rum.</ref><ref name="forsvarsmuseum">Boden Fortress exhibition at [http://www.forsvarsmuseum.se/ Försvarsmuseum Boden].</ref> and it has also been claimed that the project was more expensive than the [[JAS 39 Gripen]] project,<ref name="pm" /><ref name="prage">Prage, [http://www.sfv.se/cms/showdocument/documents/sfv/kulturvarden/2005_04/Artikel__676.pdf p. 22].</ref> which cost 106 billion SEK in total, each aircraft costing between 300 and 500 million SEK depending on what to include in the calculation.<ref name="michelsen">Michélsen, [http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=147&a=225094 Jas Gripens nota: 106 miljarder].</ref> No matter what the actual cost was, Boden Fortress has been called boastful and the "JAS project of the turn of the century" by some, while others has claimed that the fortifications kept Sweden out of two World Wars.<ref name="hagerfors" /> Others point at the psychological aspect of the fortress, that its existence had&mdash;justly or unjustly&mdash;kept a tight grip of people not only in Norrland during times when Sweden was in the shadow of war.<ref name="nyström141">Nyström, p. 141.</ref>

== Forts ==
=== Degerberget ===
[[Image:Bodenfortress.png|thumb|left|Map of the location of the individual fortifications and batteries, railroad lines, and the size of Boden in 1901 (black) and 1940 (dark grey). ([[:Image:Bodenfortress.png|Larger version]])]]

Degerberget Fort (''Degerbergsfortet'') was planned and constructed on Degerberget Mountain, north of Boden and west of the lake Buddbyträsket, between 1900 and 1908. It was the only fort in the northern fort group as defined in the 1914 defensive plans for Boden Fortress.<ref name="nyström128">Nyström, p. 128.</ref> The main artillery consisted of four 12&nbsp;cm Kanon m/99, backed up by another four 8.4&nbsp;cm Kanon m/94-04 which were replaced by 8.4&nbsp;cm Kanon m/47 in the early 1950s.<ref name="persson8-9cm">Persson, [http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~m95perm/vapen/kanon/80.html Breech-loaded Guns in cal 8 - 9cm, used by the Swedish Armed Forces].</ref> Surrounded by a caponier ditch on all sides, the fort area also features one observation post, two searchlight sites and two larger bunkers. Part of the Swedish gold reserve was kept here from 1941 to 1982.<ref name="historikkarnanlaggningar">Fästningsguiden i Norr AB, [http://www.rodbergsfortet.com/historia.htm Kort historik om Bodens fästnings kärnanläggningar].</ref> Degerberget Fort was decommissioned in 1992 together with Gammelängsberget Fort.<ref name="digmaps" />

=== Mjösjöberget ===
Mjösjöberget Fort (''Mjösjöfortet'') was planned and constructed between 1900 and 1908. A part of the eastern fort group together with Gammelängsberget Fort,<ref name="nyström128" /> it was situated on Mjösjöberget Mountain to the east of Boden. As Rödberget Fort it was fitted with the 15&nbsp;cm Fästningshaubits m/06 as main artillery, together with the standard secondary 8.4&nbsp;cm cannon and teritary 57&nbsp;mm caponier cannon. Since Rödberget Fort was refitted with new main artillery in the 1970s, Mjösjöberget Fort is the only to still feature 15&nbsp;cm main artillery as it was decommissioned in 1979, some 20 years earlier than the other forts. Like the other two forts northeast of Boden, it is surrounded on all sides by a ditch. The fort also has a large bunker and two searchlight sites close by.<ref name="historikkarnanlaggningar" />

Planned and constructed between 1900 and 1908, Gammelängsberget Fort (''Gammelängsfortet'') situated on Gammelängsberget Mountain east of Boden was the first of the five forts to be finished and the first to fire any guns when a test firing was conducted in 1907. It was part of the eastern fort group&mdash;together with the close by Mjösjöberget Fort&mdash;in the 1914 defensive plans. Just as on the other forts, the original secondary guns, 8.4&nbsp;cm Kanon m/94-04, were replaced by 8.4&nbsp;cm Kanon m/47 between 1950 and 1952. The main artillery, 12&nbsp;cm Kanon m/99, and the caponier artillery, 57&nbsp;mm Kaponjärkanon m/07, served with the fort until it was closed down in 1992. Gammelängsberget Fort is surrounded by a caponier ditch on all sides, and a large concrete bunker is located in proximity of the fort.<ref name="historikkarnanlaggningar" />

=== Södra Åberget ===
The only fort not to feature four distinct sides, Södra Åberget Fort (''Södra Åbergsfortet'') instead features the for all forts originally planned triangular design,<ref name="nyström157">Nyström, p. 157.</ref> the southwestern side being formed by the mountain scarp rather than a caponier ditch. The fort&mdash;planned and constructed on Södra Åberget Mountain south of Boden between 1902 and 1908&mdash;was together with Rödberget Fort part of the southern fort group.<ref name="nyström128" /> Södra Åberget Fort had the standard armament in the form of 12&nbsp;cm Kanon m/99, 8.4&nbsp;cm Kanon m/94-04 and 57&nbsp;mm Kaponjärkanon m/07. The 8.4&nbsp;cm artillery was modernised between 1950 and 1952. Just like the neighbour Rödberget Fort on the other side of Lule River, Södra Åberget Fort has four bunkers, two observation posts and two searchlight sites in its surroundings.<ref name="historikkarnanlaggningar" />

=== Rödberget ===
Perhaps the best known of the five forts, Rödberget Fort (''Rödbergsfortet'') situated on Rödberget Mountain southwest of Boden was the last in line for construction, which started in 1903. The fort was finished in 1908 and originally featured four 15&nbsp;cm Fästningshaubits m/06 which in 1976 were replaced by four 12&nbsp;cm Kanon m/24 taken from scrapped [[Swedish Navy]] [[destroyer]]s.<ref name="12cmdestroyerguns">Boden Fortress exhibition at [http://www.forsvarsmuseum.se/ Försvarsmuseum Boden] says that the modernisation took place in 1976, while Dig Maps AB, [http://www.bodenkartan.com/bodfastningkarta.htm Bodens fästnings karta] says that the year was 1979. It is also possible that the change of armament was made over several years.</ref> At the same time, another two 12&nbsp;cm cannon were fitted on a newly constructed small satellite fortification to the north of the fort. Rödberget Fort was part of the southern fort group together with Södra Åberget Fort on the other side of Lule River. These two  forts&mdash;unlike the other forts&mdash;do not have a caponier ditch on all sides, as the western side of Rödberget Fort is protected by the natural scarp of the mountain. The surroundings feature four large bunkers, two observation posts and two searchlight sites. Today, Rödberget Fort is the only larger fortification of Boden Fortress that is open to the public.<ref name="historikkarnanlaggningar" />

== In media ==
Boden Fortress is mentioned in [[Tage Danielsson]]'s ''[[Sagan om Karl-Bertil Jonssons Julafton]]'', the story was made into a [[short film]] in 1975 and has been shown on [[Swedish television]] every [[Christmas Eve]] since that year. Karl-Bertil Jonsson, working extra at the post office, steals Christmas gifts which are addressed to rich people and then give them to the poor, [[Robin Hood]]-style. One of all the gifts he steals is a [[match]]stick picture (''tändstickstavla'') of the fortress. When telling the intended receiver of the gift, senior administrative officer H. K. Bergdahl, what he had done Bergdahl answers "Thank you, my lad, for sparing us of Boden Fortress!"<ref name="danielsson">Danielsson, [http://web.telia.com/~u13106607/karl-ber.htm paragraph eight (of ten)].</ref>

The fortress also plays a part in ''[[Operation Garbo]]'', a three-volume [[novel]] written by [[Harry Winter]], a [[pseudonym]] for an undisclosed number of people. The [[techno-thriller]] novel is about a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of Sweden, and while Boden Fortress is not a main part of the story, one chapter in the first volume briefly mentions Åberget fort,<ref name="winter1">Winter (1988), pp. 389&ndash;391.</ref> and two chapters in the second volume are devoted to events at and around the forts, Åberget and Mjösjöberget Forts are mentioned by name while Rödberget Fort is described more in detail.<ref name="winter2">Winter (1989), pp. 32&ndash;35 & 182&ndash;185.</ref>
