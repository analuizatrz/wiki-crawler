'''''By the Way''''' is the eighth studio album by funk rock quartet [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released on [[July 9]], [[2002]]. Its opening week sold over 700,000 copies, the highest in their career until ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' was released. The album peaked at #2 on the Billboard Top 200 charts and has sold around 9 million copies total worldwide to date. 

''By the Way'' was a smash hit album in many other countries. Critics gave it more positive bound reviews, favoring the fact that the Red Hot Chili Peppers' songwriting has matured greatly over the years. The overall album was heavily influenced by [[John Frusciante]]'s work. 

The album has produced hit singles, such as the [[By the Way (song)|title track]], "[[Can't Stop (song)|Can't Stop]]", "[[The Zephyr Song]]" and "[[Universally Speaking]]".

The album was re-released through iTunes on 2006 featuring additional bonus tracks previously unreleased which are exclusive to the store. The original tracks, as with all the other re-released albums are not remastered, leaving only the bonus tracks remastered.

==History==
The Peppers recorded twenty-eight songs for ''By the Way'', but during an interview before the album's release, the Peppers revealed that they had felt it appropriate to let the more melodic work constitute the album's final arrangement. By early 2006, twenty-four of these songs had been released and accounted for through b-sides; though four remaining songs had yet to be released. In March 2006, "Bicycle Song" and "Runaway" were released via [[iTunes]] as bonus tracks, bringing the total of unreleased songs down to two. It's possible these two songs are "Rolling Sly Stone" and "Leverage of Space," which are both available on ''[[Live in Hyde Park]]''Rumors have speculated that one these songs is the 13 minute long "On Wave'. in an interveiw Frusciante stated that it was 13 minutes of pure melody .
 
It is no secret to fans that guitarist [[John Frusciante]] played a major role in this more melodic approach. His fascination with the [[Beach Boys]]' harmonies is evident in the many guitar layers present on the album. Frusciante's more melodic approach resulted in the lightest album the Chili Peppers have released in its twenty-three year career. In February 2006 whilst being interviewed about their upcoming album ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'', bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] said the following about ''By the Way'':

''"It was an unpleasant experience for me. There was definitely tension in the group, tension between John and I, and I didn't feel comfortable creatively within the band. I didn't feel free to express myself."''

It was later revealed in an interview with ''Q'' magazine the following month, that he intended to leave the band following this album and tour because the band had ceased to be fun. By the famous European Summer tour in 2004 (which spawned ''[[Live in Hyde Park]]'') he was, however, prepared to continue. In another interview with the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' music magazine, it was revealed that none of the other band members knew about this, only Flea's other closest friends outside of the band did.

==Musical style==
''By the Way'' was noted as the Chili Peppers' most subdued album filled with moody and melodic songs that include an underlying atmosphere of positivity, which fills the album's lyrics and music. Compared to earlier albums, like ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' and especially ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', ''By the Way'' features a more acute pop-friendly sound to it. The [[funk-rock]] sound the Chili Peppers have been known for is largely absent in this album. Instead, a strong melodic sound has been overlayed in the album. Tracks like "[[By the Way (song)|By the Way]]", "Throw Away Your Television" and "[[Can't Stop (song)|Can't Stop]]" have the funk-groove sound, while songs like "Midnight" and "[[The Zephyr Song]]" have the new pop-rock sound. "[[On Mercury]]" is heavily influenced by [[ska]]. It was because of this radical change of direction from the band's earlier work (which was hinted at in ''Californication'') that the ''By the Way'' album out of all their others created the most significant rift between fans of their funk-metal era and fans of their contemporary pop-orientated work; the album as much alienated fans of their younger days as it introduced new fans.
