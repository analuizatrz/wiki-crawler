'''Zhū Dé''' ({{zh-c|c=朱德}}, [[Wade-Giles]]: Chu Te, [[Chinese courtesy name#Zi|zi]]: Yùjiē 玉阶) ([[December 1]], [[1886]] – [[July 6]], [[1976]]) was a [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] military leader and statesman. He is regarded as the founder of the [[Chinese Red Army]] (the forerunner of the [[People's Liberation Army]]) and the tactician who engineered the revolution from which emerged the [[People's Republic of China]].

==Biography==
Zhu De was born into a large and very poor farming family in [[Yilong]] county, a hilly and isolated section of northern [[Sichuan]] province.  After a secondary education funded by his uncle, the only member of the family capable of doing so, and only after a family decision that he be the beneficiary of an education, Zhu felt obliged to enroll for the district examinations despite his dislike for the traditional Confucian education system.  Zhu passed these examinations, to his surprise, and was awarded a [[xiucai]] degree.  

Zhu hid these results from his family and traveled to [[Chengdu]] to study physical education.  He became a PE teacher for a short time before joining the army.  In 1904 Zhu De acted upon his anti-Manchu, republican sentiments and joined the [[Tongmenghui]], a secret society and underground resistance movement organized by [[Sun Yat-sen]] and [[Song Jiaoren]] in [[Tokyo]] on 20 August 1905.

In 1908, he entered the Yunnan Military Academy in [[Kunming]], where he came under the influence of [[Cai E]] (Tsai Ao). Due to Cai, Zhu De taught at the Academy after his graduation in July 1911.  Cai E was a very significant figure in Chinese history since when [[Yuan Shikai]] proclaimed himself Emperor of a new Empire of China in 1915, Cai and [[Tang Jiyao]] launched the [[Republic-Protection Campaign]] in [[Yunnan]] to crusade against Yuan. With only 20,000 soldiers they defeated Yuan’s army of 80,000 in Sichuan. With several provinces behind them, the revolutionaries successfully forced Yuan to abandon monarchism.  Zhu De participated in these events.

Zhu joined the rebellion that overthrew the [[Qing]] dynasty in 1911. He participated in military campaigns with armies of the [[Yunnan]] warlords and commanded units along the [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]] borders in the early years of the [[Chinese Republic]].  In 1916, following the death of his mentor [[Cai E]], he fell into a depression and developed a strong opium habit, falling futher into a life of decadence and warlordism.  However, due to Zhu's love of reading and exposure to communism he decided to abandon his warlord lifestyle, recovering from his addiction to opium in 1920 in [[Shanghai]].  Zhu also attempted to join the [[Chinese Communist Party]] in early 1922, but was rejected due to his former warlord ties.  Zhu De began to read about [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] in [[Shanghai]].  

In late 1922<ref>Whitson, William W., with  Huang, Chen-hsia, The Chinese High Command: A History of Communist Military Politics, 1927-71, Praeger Publishers: New York, 1973, p. 30.</ref>, Zhu went to [[Europe]], studying at [[Georg August University of Göttingen|Göttingen University]] in Germany from 1922 to 1925 at which point he met [[Zhou Enlai]] and was expelled from the country by the government for his role in a number of student protests.  Around this time, he joined the [[Communist Party]].  Zhou Enlai was one of his sponsors.  In [[July]] [[1925]], he traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] to study military affairs.  In July [[1926]], he returned to [[China]] and undertook to persude Sichuan warlord Yang Sen to support the Northern Expedition<ref>Whitson, William W., with  Huang, Chen-hsia, The Chinese High Command: A History of Communist Military Politics, 1927-71, Praeger Publishers: New York, 1973, p. 30.</ref>, but failed. Soon after, he was named head of a new military institute in Nanchang.

In 1927, following the collapse of the First United Front, [[Liu Bocheng]] and Zhou Enlai<ref>Whitson, William W., with  Huang, Chen-hsia, The Chinese High Command: A History of Communist Military Politics, 1927-71, Praeger Publishers: New York, 1973, p. 31.</ref> ordered Zhu to lead a force against the [[Nanchang Uprising]].  However, as he had helped to orchestrate this uprising, Zhu and his army defected from the Guomindang and fought against them.  The uprising failed to gather the support of the local working class, however, and he was forced to flee [[Nanchang]] with his army.  Under the fake name Wang Kai, Zhu managed to find shelter from a warlord Fan Shisheng for his remaining regiment.  He eventually expanded his force.

Zhu's close affiliation with [[Mao Zedong]] began in 1928 when under the assistance of [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]] and [[Lin Biao]], Zhu brought his army of 10,000 men to the [[Jinggangshan|Jinggang Mountains]] where Mao had formed a soviet in 1927. From these humble beginnings, Zhu built the [[People's Liberation Army|Red Army]] into a skilled [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force that consolidated and expanded the PLA areas of control. 

Zhu was the military expert, and Mao was the political expert.  They needed each other.

Zhu's bravery and skill in leading these men made him a figure of immense prestige.  Locals credited him with supernatural abilities. During this time Mao and Zhu became so closely connected that to the local peasant farmers they were known collectively as "Zhu Mao". 

In 1929 Zhu and Mao were forced to flee [[Jinggangshan]] to [[Ruijin]] to the East following Guomindang military pressure. Here they formed the [[Jiangxi Soviet]] which would eventually grow to cover some 30, 000 square kilometers and include some three million people. In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in the [[Ruijin]] by the CCP leadership. Zhu successfully led a conventional military force against the Guomindang during the [[Fourth Encirclement Campaign|Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign]]; however he was not able to do the same during the [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign|Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign]] and reluctantly the CCP began to make preparations to flee the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]. Zhu helped to form the 1934 break out from the soviet that would begin the [[Long March]].

During the [[Long March]], Zhu De and [[Zhang Guotao]] commanded the "western column" of the Red Army, which barely survived the retreat through [[Sichuan]] Province. 

In [[Yan'an]], Zhu directed the reconstruction of the Red Army under the political guidance of Mao.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], he held the position of [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Red Army. In 1940 Zhu De devised and organized the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] without the support of Mao.  This campaign was very successful but has since been attributed as the main provocation for the devastating Japanese [[Three Alls Policy]].

After [[1949]], Zhu was named Commander-in-Chief of the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA). He was also the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party (1956-1966) and Vice-Chairman of the People's Republic of China (1954-1959). In 1950 Zhu De oversaw the PLA during the [[Korean War]].  In 1955, he was made a marshal. 

In 1966, during the onset of the Cultural Revolution, Zhu De was dismissed from his position on the Standing Committee of the [[National People's Congress]].  However, thanks to the support of [[Zhou Enlai]] he was not harmed or imprisoned. In 1971 Zhu was reinstated as the Chairman of the Standing Committee. 

He continued to be a prominent and respected elder statesman until his death in July 1976.
