'''Lethbridge''' ({{pronEng|ˈlɛθbrɨdʒ}}) is a city in the province of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], and the largest city in [[southern Alberta]]. It is Alberta's fourth-largest city by population after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and the third-largest by area after Calgary and Edmonton. The nearby  [[Canadian Rockies]] contribute to the city's cool summers, mild winters, and [[Chinook wind|windy climate]]. Lethbridge lies southeast of Calgary on the [[Oldman River]]. 

Lethbridge is the commercial, financial, transportation and industrial centre of southern Alberta. The city's economy developed from [[drift mining]] for coal in the late 19th century and [[agriculture]] in the early 20th century. Half of the workforce is employed in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government-based. The only university in Alberta south of Calgary is in Lethbridge, and two of the three colleges in southern Alberta have campuses in the city. Cultural venues in the city include performing art theatres, museums and sports centres.

==History==
{{main|History of Lethbridge}}

Before the 19th century, the Lethbridge area was populated by several [[First Nations]] at various times. The [[Blackfoot]] referred to the area as ''Aksaysim'' ("steep banks"), ''Mek-kio-towaghs'' ("painted rock"), ''Assini-etomochi'' ("where we slaughtered the Cree") and ''Sik-ooh-kotok'' ("coal"). The [[Tsuu T'ina Nation|Sarcee]] referred to it as ''Chadish-kashi'' ("black/rocks"), the [[Cree]] as ''Kuskusukisay-guni'' ("black/rocks"), and the [[Nakoda (people)|Nakoda]] (Stoney) as ''Ipubin-saba-akabin'' ("digging coal").<ref name="Ellis" />

After the US Army stopped alcohol trading with the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation|Blackfeet Nation]] in [[Montana]] in 1869, traders [[John Healy|John J. Healy]] and Alfred B. Hamilton started a whiskey trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post's nickname became [[Fort Whoop-Up]].<ref name="Ellis">{{cite web |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/Short+History.htm |title=A Short History of Lethbridge, Alberta| author=Greg Ellis |month=October |year=2001 |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> The whiskey trade led to the [[Cypress Hills massacre]] of many native [[Assiniboine]] in 1873. The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North West Mounted Police]], sent to  stop the trade and establish order,<ref name="Ellis"/> arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on [[9 October]] [[1874]]. They managed the post for the next 12 years.<ref name="Ellis"/>

Lethbridge's economy developed from [[drift mining|drift mines]] opened by [[Nicholas Sheran]] in 1874 and the [[North Western Coal and Navigation Company]] in 1882. North Western's president was [[William Lethbridge]], from whom the city derives its name.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Battle Park |publisher=City of Lethbridge  
|url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/City+Hall/Departments/Parks+-+Pathways+-+Trails/Major+Parks/Indian+Battle+Park/Indian+Battle+Park.htm |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> By the turn of the century, the mines were employing about 150 men and producing about 300 tonnes of coal each day.<ref name="Ellis"/> In 1896, local collieries were the largest coal producers in the [[Northwest Territories]]<ref>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/History+of+Lethbridge/Masonry+Sculptures/Masonry.htm City of Lethbridge website]</ref>, with production peaking during [[World War I]]. After the war, increasing oil and natural gas production gradually replaced coal production,<ref name="Ellis"/> and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957. 

The first rail line in Lethbridge was opened on [[28 August]] [[1885]] by the Alberta Railway and Coal Company,<ref name="Ellis" /> which bought the North Western Coal and Navigation Company five years later.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alberta Railway and Coal Company |work=Table of Private Acts (1867 to December 31, 2006), Railways |publisher=Department of Justice Canada |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/privlaw/214797/2525.html |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> The rail industry's dependence on coal and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s efforts to settle southern Alberta with immigrants boosted Lethbridge's economy. After the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) moved the divisional point of its Crowsnest Line from Fort Macleod to Lethbridge in 1905, the city became the regional centre for [[Southern Alberta]].<ref name="Ellis"/> In the mid-1980s, the CPR moved its rail yards in downtown Lethbridge to nearby Kipp, and Lethbridge ceased being a rail hub.<ref>{{cite web |title=Executive Summary |work=Highways 3 & 4, Lethbridge and Area NHS & NSTC, Functional Planning Study, #R - 970 |publisher=Stantec Consulting Ltd. |date=February 2006 |url=http://www.infratrans.gov.ab.ca/INFTRA_Content/docType182/Production/exec_summ.pdf |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>

Between 1907 and 1913, a development boom occurred in Lethbridge, making it the main marketing, distribution and service centre in southern Alberta.<ref name="Ellis"/> Such municipal projects as a water treatment plant, a power plant, a [[Lethbridge Transit|streetcar system]], and [[Exhibition Park (Lethbridge)|exhibition buildings]] — as well as a construction boom and rising real estate prices — transformed the mining town into a significant city.<ref name="Ellis"/> Between World War I and [[World War II]], however, the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak.<ref name="Ellis"/> After World War II, irrigation of farmland near Lethbridge led to growth in the city's population and economy. [[Lethbridge College]] (previously Lethbridge Community College) opened in April 1957 and the [[University of Lethbridge]] in 1967.<ref name="Ellis"/>

===Climate===
Lethbridge has a moderate continental climate with an average maximum temperature of 12.3 °[[Celsius|C]] (54.1 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) and an average minimum temperature of −1.0 °C (30.2 °F). With an average precipitation of 386.3&nbsp;millimetres (15.21&nbsp;in) and 264 dry days on average, Lethbridge is the second driest city in Canada.<ref name="winners" /> On average, Lethbridge has 116 days with wind speed of 40&nbsp;km/h (25&nbsp;mph) or higher, ranking it as the second city in Canada for such weather.<ref name="winners">[http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/weather/winners/intro-e.html Weather Winners], Environment Canada. Accessed [[26 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

Its high elevation of 929&nbsp;metres (3,048&nbsp;ft) and close proximity to the Rocky Mountains provides Lethbridge with cooler summers than other locations in the Canadian prairies.<ref name="bus-inv-profile">[http://www.chooselethbridge.ca/media/publication_1.pdf  Business Investment Profile 2005/2006], Economic Development Lethbridge. 2005. Accessed 7 November 2006.</ref> These factors protect the city from strong northwest and southwest winds and contribute to frequent [[chinook wind]]s during the winter. Lethbridge winters have the highest temperatures in the prairies, reducing the severity and duration of winter cold periods and resulting in fewer days with snow cover.<ref name="chamber">[http://lethbridgechamber.com/community.php Community Profile], Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce.

==Major attractions==
[[Image:lethbridge Viaduct.gif|thumb|right|High Level Bridge near downtown Lethbridge]]

The city, which began as a frontier town, has several historical attractions. The [[Lethbridge Viaduct]], commonly known as the ''High Level Bridge'', is a steel trestle bridge. It was completed in 1909 on what was then the city's western edge.<ref>{{cite web | title = High Level Bridge | publisher = City of Lethbridge | url = http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/Landmarks/High+Level+Bridge/High+Level+Bridge.htm

[[Image:Fort Whoop-Up.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Whoop-Up in Lethbridge]]
Originally known as Fort Hamilton, [[Fort Whoop-Up]] was a centre of illegal activities during the late 19th century. It was first built in 1869 by J.J. Healy and A.B. Hamilton as a whiskey post and was destroyed by fire a year later. A second, sturdier structure later replaced the fort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Allen | first = Robert | title =Fort Whoop-Up | encyclopedia =The Canadian Encyclopedia | url =http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002974 | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}</ref>

As the cultural centre of southern Alberta, Lethbridge has notable cultural attractions. [[Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden]] in south Lethbridge was opened in 1967 as part of a Canadian centennial celebration attended by [[Japan]]’s Prince and Princess [[Prince Takamatsu|Takamatsu]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Neugebauer | first = Dierk | title = Nikka Yuko - A Special Place | journal = The Journal | publisher = Toronto Bonsai Society | date = January 2003 | url = http://torontobonsai.org/Journal/Journal.2003/jan.2003/nikka.yuko.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}</ref> [[Galt Museum & Archives]] is the largest museum in the Lethbridge area; the building housing the museum served as the city's main hospital during the late 19th century and early 20th centuries.<ref>{{cite web | title = Our History | publisher = Galt Museum & Archives | url = http://www.galtmuseum.com/aboutus-ourhistory.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}</ref>

[[Image:Lethbridge skyline.jpg|thumb|right|Skyline of downtown Lethbridge]]
Several structures such as the post office are prominent on the skyline of Lethbridge. Less well-known than the High Level Bridge, the post office is one of the most distinctive buildings in Lethbridge. Built in 1912, the four-storey structure is crowned by a functioning clock tower.<ref>{{cite web | title = Buildings | publisher = City of Lethbridge | url = http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/Buildings/Buildings.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}</ref> Other prominent buildings include office towers; the water tower, which was originally built in 1958 and sold to a private developer who converted it into a restaurant;<ref>{{cite web | title = Landmarks | publisher = City of Lethbridge | url = http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/Landmarks/Landmarks.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}</ref> and the Alberta Terminals grain elevators.

==Education==
The public [[Lethbridge School District No. 51|Lethbridge School District]] and the separate Catholic Holy Spirit Division administer grades [[kindergarten]] through 12 locally. The Palliser School Division, which is based in Lethbridge, administers public primary and secondary education in the outlying areas. The Third Academy private school has a campus in Lethbridge.

Lethbridge is home to [[Lethbridge College]],  founded in 1957, and the [[University of Lethbridge]], founded in 1967. [[Red Crow Community College]] has a campus in the city. During the 2003–2004 school year, the University of Lethbridge and the Lethbridge College  had a combined enrolment of 14,000, which was 20&nbsp;percent of the city's population.<ref>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/D4CEB98B-9F18-4786-870D-84A06E1533FC/310/LethbridgeProfile2003.pdf Lethbridge Profile, 2003–2004], City of Lethbridge</ref>

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Lethbridge}}
Mass transit in Lethbridge consists of 40&nbsp;buses (with an average age of 10&nbsp;years) operating on more than a dozen routes.<ref>{{cite news |date=[[2006-09-09]] |title=Richard keeps the city's buses on the road |publisher=Lethbridge Herald |first=Dave |last=Mabell |language=English |page=A4}}</ref> Traditionally, bus routes in the city started and ended downtown. In the early 21st century, however, [[Lethbridge Transit]] introduced cross-town and shuttle routes, such as [[University of Lethbridge]] to Lethbridge College, University of Lethbridge to the North Lethbridge terminal, and Lethbridge College to the North Lethbridge terminal. Several routes converge near the [[Chinook Regional Hospital]], although it is not officially a terminal.

The Parks and Recreation department maintains the citywide, 30-kilometre (19 mi) pedestrian/cyclist [[Coal Banks Trail]] system ([http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/6B643DF7-1C9B-4F0C-BB83-978877550638/0/Regional_Trail.pdf map]). The system was designed to connect the [[Oldman River]] valley with other areas of the city, including Pavan Park in the north, Henderson Lake in the east, [[Alberta Highway 4|Highways 4]] and [[Alberta Highway 5|5]] in the south and a loop in West Lethbridge (including University Drive and McMaster Blvd).<ref>{{cite web |title=Coal Banks Trail |publisher=City of Lethbridge |url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/City+Hall/Departments/Parks+-+Pathways+-+Trails/Pathways+and+Trails/Coal+Banks+Trail/Coal+Banks+Trail.htm |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref>

Four provincial highways ([[Crowsnest Highway|3]], 4, 5, and [[Alberta Highway 25|25]]) run through or terminate in Lethbridge. This has led to the creation of major arterial roads, including Mayor Magrath Drive, University Drive and Scenic Drive. This infrastructure and its location on the [[CANAMEX Corridor]] has helped make Lethbridge and its freight depots a major shipping destination.<ref name="chamber"/> Lethbridge is 100&nbsp;kilometres (62&nbsp;mi) north of the [[United States]] border via Highways&nbsp;4 and 5 and 210&nbsp;kilometres (130&nbsp;mi) south of [[Calgary]] via [[Alberta Highway 2|Highways 2]] and 3. Highways&nbsp;2, 3 and 4 form part of the [[CANAMEX]] trade route between [[Mexico]], the [[United States]], and Canada.<ref name="chamber"/>

Lethbridge is near the [[Lethbridge County Airport]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] rail yards in Kipp, Alberta. The rail yards were moved to Kipp, just west of the city, from downtown Lethbridge in 1983 to make way for commercial expansion.<ref>[http://www.crowsnest-highway.ca/cgi-bin/citypage.pl?city=COALHURST Coalhurst, Alberta : History], The Virtual Crowsnest Highway. Accessed [[26 December]] [[2006]].</ref> The county airport provides commercial flights—to Calgary, Edmonton and other Alberta cities, and to [[Mexico]]—as well as private and charter flights elsewhere. The airport provides customs services for flights arriving from the United States.
