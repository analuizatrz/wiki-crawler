'''Amarillo''' is the 11th-largest city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Potter County, Texas|Potter&nbsp;County]].<ref>{{cite web | author =Texas State Library / U.S. Census Bureau | url = http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/popcity32000.html | title = 2000 Census: Population of Texas Cities | accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref>  A portion of the city, the biggest in the [[Texas Panhandle]], extends into [[Randall County, Texas|Randall County]]. As of the 2000 [[U.S. Census]], the city had a total population of 173,627 (though a [[July 1]], [[2005]] estimate placed the city's population at 183,021). The [[Amarillo metropolitan area]], however, has an estimated population of 236,113 in four counties.
Amarillo's Population is expected to be 200,000 by the year 2010. [[http://www.kvii.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=78098]]

Amarillo was originally named Oneida and it is situated in the [[Llano Estacado]] region.<ref name="tx_pan">Rathjen, Fredrick W. ''The Texas Panhandle Frontier'' (1973). pg. 11.

==History==
In April 1887, J. T. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well-watered section along the way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the [[Texas Panhandle]]. Berry and [[Colorado City, Texas]] merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On [[August 30]], [[1887]], Berry's town site won the [[county seat]] election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the [[railroad]] and [[freight]] service after the county seat election made the town a fast growing [[cattle]] marketing center.<ref name="handbook" />

The settlement originally was called Oneida; it would later change its name to Amarillo. Amarillo's name probably derives from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores (''Amarillo'' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for the color ''yellow''). Despite having a name of Spanish origin, the City of Amarillo is pronounced in [[English language|English]] as "Am-ah-RILL-oh" rather than "Ah-mah-REE-yoh". Early residents pronounced it according to the Spanish pronunciation, but within a year, the English pronunciation prevailed. Charles F. Rudolph, editor of the ''Tascosa Pioneer'', predicted the pronunciation change after blaming Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad employees for ignoring the word's Spanish pronunciation.<ref>Hammond, Clara T., comp. ''Amarillo'' (1974). pg. 6. George Autry, Printer, Amarillo, Texas.</ref>

[[Image:Amarillo Texas Downtown 1912.jpg|left|thumb|270px|An aeroplane view of the Amarillo business district in 1912.]]

On [[June 19]], [[1888]], Henry B. Sanborn, who is given credit as the "Father of Amarillo,"<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Everett, Liz |title=History Makers of the High Plains: H.B. Sanborn |date=May 19, 2000 |publisher=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/051900/his_sanborn.html |accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref> and his business partner [[Joseph Glidden|Joseph F. Glidden]] began buying land to the east to move Amarillo after arguing that Berry's site was on low ground and would flood during rainstorms. Sanborn also offered to trade lots in the new location to businesses in the original city’s site and help with the expense of moving to new buildings. His incentives gradually won over people, who moved their businesses to Polk Street in the new commercial district.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Crawford, Jim |title=A town determined to survive  |date=July 23, 2006  |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/072306/spe_disama7.shtml |accessdate = 2007-01-27}}</ref> Heavy rains almost flooded Berry’s part of the town in 1889, prompting more people to move to Sanborn's location. This eventually led to another county seat election making Sanborn's town the new county seat in 1893.<ref name="handbook" />

By the late 1890s, Amarillo had emerged as one of the world's busiest cattle shipping points, and its population grew significantly. The city became an elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of [[natural gas|gas]] in 1918 and [[Petroleum|oil]] three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.<ref name="handbook" /> The United States government bought the Cliffside Gas Field with high helium content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium Plant two years later.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Livadas,Greg |title=State of Ballooning: Texas |date=October 1999 |publisher=Balloon Life Magazine |url=http://balloonlife.com/publications/balloon_life/9801/9910/sob9910.html|accessdate = 2006-01-25}}</ref> The plant would be the sole producer of commercial helium in the world for a number of years.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=HH/doh2|name=Helium Production}}.

Following the lead of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] and [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] established services to and from Amarillo. Each of these three carriers maintained substantial freight and passenger depots and repair facilities in the city through most of the 20th century and were major employers within the community.<ref name="railroads">{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Welch, Kevin |title=Crossroads of America |date=July 23, 2006 |publisher=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/072306/spe_disama2.shtml|accessdate = 2007-01-25 }}</ref> 

During the 1930s, the city was hit by the [[Dust Bowl]] and entered an [[Great Depression|economic depression]]. The [[U.S. Routes]] 60, 87, 287, and 66 merged at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and [[curio]] shops. [[World War II]] led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the [[Cold War]].<ref name="handbook" /> The following year, the army air base was reactivated as [[Amarillo Air Force Base]] and expanded to accommodate a [[Strategic Air Command]] [[B-52 Stratofortress]] wing.<ref>{{cite web | author = Amarillo Economic Development Corporation | url = http://www.amarilloedc.com/index.php?id=51 | title = Community History | accessdate = 2006-01-28}}</ref> The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city's depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo's population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of the Amarillo Air Force Base on [[December 31]], [[1968]], contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970. In the 1970s, [[ASARCO]], Iowa Beef Processors,(present day [Tyson Foods]), [[Owens-Corning]] and [[Weyerhaeuser]] built plants at Amarillo. The Eastridge neighborhood houses immigrants from countries such as [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Burma]]. Many of them found employment at the nearby Iowa Beef Processors plant.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Beck, Bruce |title=Representing all walks of life |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News|url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/122706/our_6355729.shtml |accessdate = 2007-01-26}}</ref> The following decade, Amarillo's city limits encompassed 60 square miles (160 km²) in Potter and Randall counties. The [[Interstate 27]] highway connecting [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] to Amarillo was built mostly during the 1980s.<ref name="handbook" />

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:palodurolighthouse.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Lighthouse [[Hoodoo (geology)|hoodoo]] in Palo Duro Canyon. The canyon system is located south of the city.]]
Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle and is part of the Llano Estacado or Staked Plains region which has a surface that is relatively flat and has little drainage in the soil. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in [[playa lake]]s.<ref name="tx_pan" /> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 90.3&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]] (234&nbsp;[[square kilometer|km²]]). 89.9 sq&nbsp;mi (233 km²) of it is land and 0.4 sq&nbsp;mi&nbsp;(1.2 km²) of it (0.50%) is water. The Amarillo metropolitan area is the [[List of United States metropolitan statistical areas by population|180th-largest]] in the United States with a population of 236,113 in four counties: [[Armstrong County, Texas|Armstrong]], [[Carson County, Texas|Carson]], Potter, and Randall.

About 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Amarillo is the [[Canadian River]], which divides the southern part of the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] to form the Llano Estacado. The river is [[dam]]med to form [[Lake Meredith]], a major source of drinking water in the Texas Panhandle region.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=CC/rnc2|name=Canadian River}}.

Amarillo's historic homes and buildings listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] reflect the economic growth from around 1900 to the start of World War II. Polk Street contains many of the city's historic downtown buildings and homes. The large historic homes on this street were built close to downtown, and homes were located on the west side of the street as a symbol of status because they would be greeted with the sunrise every morning.<ref>{{cite web | author = [[Morris Communications|Excursia / Best Read Guide]] | url = http://excursia.com/destinations/USA/TX/amarillo/stories/20000929/att_historictour.shtml | title = Take a Historic Tour of Amarillo | accessdate = 2006-03-11}}</ref>

The City of Amarillo's Parks and Recreation Department operates over 50 municipal parks including a [[skatepark]], west of the city. Amarillo's largest parks are Medical Park, Thompson Memorial Park, and Memorial Park, near Amarillo College's Washington Street Campus. From 1978 to 2002, the [[Junior League]] of Amarillo and the City of Amarillo's Parks and Recreation Department co-sponsored Funfest, a family entertainment festival, benefiting the city parks and the league's Community Chest Trust Fund.

===Climate===
Amarillo and the Texas Panhandle's climate is a [[semi-arid]] temperate steppe climate ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''BSk''). It is characterized by a rush of cold air from the north or northwest into a warmer area and occasionally, by [[blizzard]]s during the winter season and a hot summer with generally low to moderate humidity. The normal annual rainfall for Amarillo is approximately 20&nbsp;inches (508&nbsp;mm). Most of the region's precipitation occurs in the late spring and summer months, and the least occurs from November through March.<ref>Rathjen, pg. 17.</ref> The January's average high in the city is 49&nbsp;°F (9&nbsp;°C) and average low is 22&nbsp;°F (-6&nbsp;°C); July's average high is 91&nbsp;°F (33&nbsp;°C) and average low is 65&nbsp;°F (18&nbsp;°C).<ref name="climate">{{cite web | author = Weatherbase | url = http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=036327&refer= | title = Historical Weather for Amarillo, Texas, United States of America | format = HTML | accessdate = 2006-04-15}}</ref> The highest temperature ever recorded in Amarillo was 108&nbsp;°F (42&nbsp;°C); the lowest was -16&nbsp;°F (-27&nbsp;°C).<ref>{{cite web | author = NOAA | url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ama/climate/rec_norm_ama.htm | title = Records, Normals and Climate Notes For Amarillo | accessdate = 2006-02-13}}</ref> Amarillo and the Texas Panhandle are situated on the western portion of "[[Tornado Alley]]."<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Doyle, Thomas |title=Experts say tornado season nears  |date=March 29, 2001 |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/032901/new_tornadao.shtml|accessdate = 2007-01-26 }}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
[[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport]] is located on the east side of Amarillo, north of Interstate 40. A portion of the former Amarillo Air Force Base was converted to civilian use and became part of the airport.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=AA/qba1|name=Amarillo Air Force Base}}. Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[January 25|01-25]].</ref> The airport was named after [[NASA]] astronaut [[Rick Husband]], an Amarillo native and commander of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]]. The airport is served by several major air carriers with non-stop service to [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].

[[Image:Amarillo Tx - Brick Streets.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Several streets around Amarillo's downtown area are still paved in bricks.]]
Local transit services in the city have been available since 1925 and have been provided through the City of Amarillo's Amarillo City Transit (ACT) department since 1966; prior to that time the system was privately owned. ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response [[paratransit]] which are designed for people with disabilities. The ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers per year on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers, but it is a declining ridership. ACT has no plans to scale back any of their transit routes or services.<ref name="community" />

Amarillo has no passenger rail service but remains an important part of the rail freight system. The [[BNSF Railway]] complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100-110 trains per day.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Cunningham, Greg |title=Transportation key to Amarillo's past, future |date=June 26, 2005 |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/062605/spe_disama_6.shtml|accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref> The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal.

The streets in Amarillo's downtown area conform to a [[grid pattern]]. The city's original street layout was set up by William H. Bush, beginning at the west end of the town moving to the east. Bush named the north to south streets for past [[President of the United States|United States presidents]], in chronological order except for [[John Quincy Adams]] because the surname was taken with the second president, [[John Adams]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Routon, Ralph |title=Street names can honor past, embrace future |date=February 8, 2004 |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/020804/new_routon.shtml|accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref> (The last president so honored was [[Grover Cleveland]]; though the city has expanded eastward the pattern was not continued.)  While the streets running north-south honor past presidents and are designated 'streets', east-west streets are numbered and are designated 'avenues'.  North of the Fort Worth & Denver (now Burlington Northern-Santa Fe) railyard, the numbers are "NW" (northwest) west of Polk Street, and "NE" (northeast) east of Polk.  South of the railyard (including the downtown-city center area), numbers are officially "SW" (southwest) west of Polk, and "SE" (southeast) east of Polk.  Colloquially, though, most tend to dub the SW/SE avenues as W (west)/E (east), respectively.  One example of the numbering difference regards the former U.S. Route 66 routing west of downtown and into the San Jacinto neighborhood.  Most call it 'West Sixth Street' when it's actually SW Sixth Avenue.

In 1910, the Amarillo voters approved to pay for street paving and the materials used to pave the streets were [[brick]]s.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Parker, Debra A. |title=Brick streets helped build |date=May 17, 2001 |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/051701/new_brickstreets.shtml|accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref> As of 2003, the city still has 16.2&nbsp;mi (26.1&nbsp;km) of brick streets in some parts of the downtown area. The city spent $200,000 in 2002 to restore one block of brick street on Ninth Avenue between Polk and Tyler streets.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author=Chapman, Joe |title=Touchstones of history |date=August 10, 2003 |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/081003/new_touchstones.shtml|accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref>

Less than one mile (2 km) of [[Interstate 27]] highway is located in Potter County. The highway terminates at the city's main west-east highway, [[Interstate 40]], just north of the Potter-Randall County line. The roadway continues northward into downtown Amarillo via U.S. [[U.S. Route 60|60]], [[U.S. Route 87|87]], and [[U.S. Route 287|287]], via a series of four one-way streets including Buchanan, Pierce, Fillmore and Taylor. North of downtown the highway becomes U.S. 87 & 287 and continues northward to [[Dumas, Texas]].<ref name="i27" /> 

Interstate 40, the city's major east-west thoroughfare was completed entirely through Amarillo in November of 1968 across the center of the city. Previously, [[U.S. Route 66]] was the major east-west highway through the city, generally following Amarillo Blvd. to the north of the downtown area and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which was an original alignment of U.S. 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into the downtown area and turned on West 6th through the San Jacinto Heights district which is now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses, passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Blvd. before tying into the through route at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.
Loop 335 circles around Amarillo in all four directions and consists of four-lane roadway on its northeast and southwest quadrants and two-lane paving to the southeast and northwest.
