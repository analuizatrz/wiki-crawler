'''Walruses''' (''Odobenus rosmarus'') are large semi-aquatic [[mammal]]s that live in the cold [[Arctic]] seas of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. There are six reproductive populations in the Arctic: four in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], one in the [[Pacific Ocean]], and one in the [[Laptev Sea]].  The Pacific walrus is slightly larger, with males weighing up to 2,045 kg (4,500 [[pound (mass)|lb]]), while Atlantic males top out at 1,600 kg (3,500 lb).  Global walrus populations have recovered somewhat from a long history of commercial exploitation for blubber and ivory, which was effectively ended early in the 20th century.  The Atlantic population, however, remains at historically depressed levels.  

==Taxonomy== 

Walruses are mammals in the the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]].  They are the sole surviving members of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Odobenidae''', one of three lineages in the [[suborder]] [[Pinnipedia]] along with true seals ([[Phocidae]]), and eared seals ([[Otariidae]]).  There is, however, considerable debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a common ancestor<ref>Lento, G.M., Hickson, R.E., Chambers, G.K., Penny, D. 1995. Use of spectral analysis to test hypotheses on the origin of pinnipeds. Molecular Biology and Evolution 12(1) : 28-52.</ref>.  

Two subspecies of walrus are commonly recognized:  The Atlantic walrus (''Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus'') and the Pacific walrus (''Odobenus r. divergens''). A third, isolated population of walruses in the [[Laptev Sea]] is considered by some to be a third subspecies (''Odobenus r. laptevi'' Chapsky 1940) and is managed as such in Russia, but this separation is not universally accepted.

== Range and population==

[[Image:Noaa-walrus31.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Closeup of a walrus]]  

There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the last census-based estimation in 1990.  Most spend the summer north of the [[Bering Strait]] in the [[Chukchi Sea]] along the north shore of eastern [[Siberia]], around [[Wrangel Island]], in the [[Beaufort Sea]] along the north shore of [[Alaska]], and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the [[Gulf of Anadyr]] on the south shore of the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] of Siberia and in Bristol Bay off the south shore of southern Alaska west of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. In the spring and fall they congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the west shores of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr.  They winter to the south in the Bering Sea along the eastern shore of Siberia south to the northern part of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], and along the southern shore of Alaska. Fossils indicate that during the Ice Age, the Pacific Walrus ranged as far south as San Francisco in Northern California.

The Atlantic population, which was nearly decimated by commercial harvest, is much smaller.  Good estimates are difficult to obtain, but the total number is probably below 20,000.   They range from the Canadian Arctic, [[Greenland]], [[Svalbard]] and the western portion of the Russian Arctic. The Atlantic walrus once enjoyed a range that extended south to [[Cape Cod]] and occurred in large numbers in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]].  In April 2006, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Northwest Atlantic walrus population ([[Québec]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Atlantic Ocean]]) as being extirpated in [[Canada]].

==Physical description==
[[Image:WalrusLyd2.png|thumb|Skeleton]]

Walruses are second in size only to [[elephant seals]] among pinnipeds, with males weighing almost two tons (4000 lbs) and females weighing over a ton.  The body shape is more similar to that of a [[eared seal]] (otariidae) than [[phocid|true seals]] (phocidae), with rear flippers that can turn forward and a prominent thick neck.  Unlike otariids, they have no external ears.  

The most prominent physical feature of the walrus is their long tusks, actually elongated [[tooth|canines]], which are present in both sexes and can reach a length of 1 meter.   These are slightly longer and thicker among males, who use them for fighting, dominance and display; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominating social groups.  Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and haul out onto ice.  It was previously assumed that tusks were used to dig out prey items from the seabed, but analyses of abrasion patterns on the tusks indicate that they are dragged through the sediment while the upper edge of the snout is used for digging.  

Surrounding the tusks is a broad mat of stiff bristles ('mystacial vibrissae') that can be up to 30 cm (12 in) in length and give the walrus a whiskered appearance. The so-called vibrissal array is a highly sensitive organ capable of differentiating shapes 3mm thick and 0.2 cm wide <ref>  Kastelein, R.A., Stevens, S., & Mosterd, P. 1990. The sensitivity of the vibrissae of a Pacific Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens). Part 2: Masking. Aquatic Mammals 16(2) : 78-87. </ref>.

Aside from the vibrissae, walruses are sparcely covered with fur and appear bald.  Their skin is highly wrinkled and thick, up to 10 cm (4 in) around the neck and shoulders of males. The blubber layer beneath is up to 6 in (15 cm) thick.  Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler as they age.  Old males, in particular, become nearly pink.  Because the blood vessels in the skin constrict in cold water, walruses can appear almost white when swimming.  As a secondary sexual characteristic, males also acquire significant nodules, called ''bosses'', particularly around the neck and shoulders.    

Walruses have air sacs under their throats which act like flotation bubbles and allow walruses to bob vertically in the water and sleep.  The males possess a large baculum (penis bone), up to 63 cm in length, the largest of any mammal both absolutely and relative to body size.  

Pacific walruses tend to be slightly larger than Atlantic walruses and have longer tusks and smaller noses.

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Noaa-walrus12.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Walruses fighting]]

Walruses live around 50 years.  The males reach sexual maturity as early as 7 years, but do not typically mate until fully developed around 15 years of age. They go into rut in January through April, decreasing their food intake dramatically. The females can begin ovulating as soon as 4–6 years old. The females are polyestrous, coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are only fertile around February; the potential fertility of this second period of estrous is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March with peak conception in February.  Male walruses aggregate in the water around ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays.<ref> S. N. Nowicki, Ian Stirling, Becky Sjare (1997). Duration of stereotypes underwater vocal displays by make Atlantic walruses in relation to aerobic dive limit.  Marine Mammal Science 13 (4), 566–575.</ref>  The females join them and copulation occurs in the water.<ref> Fay, F. H. (1982). "Ecology and Biology of the Pacific Walrus, Odobenus rosmarus divergens Illiger" United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service. </ref>

Total [[gestation]] lasts 15 to 16 months, though 3 to 4 of those months are spent with the [[blastula]] in suspended development before finally implanting itself in the placenta. This strategy of [[delayed implantation]], common among other pinnipeds, presumably evolved to optimize the season of the birth itself.  The calves are born during the spring migration from April to June.  They weigh 45 to 75 kg (100 to 160 pounds) at birth and are able to swim.  The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning, but the young can spend up to 3 to 5 years with the mothers.  Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned, female walruses give birth at most once every two years, resulting in walrus having the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped. 

In the non-reproductive season (late summer and fall) walruses tend to migrate away from the ice and form massive aggregations of tens of thousands of individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops.  The nature of the migration between the reproductive period and the summer period but can be rather long-distance and dramatic.  In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand walruses from the Pacific walrus population migrate from the  Bering sea into the Chukchi sea through the relatively narrow [[Bering Strait]].

==Feeding==
[[Image:Noaa-walrus13.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Walrus swimming]]
[[Image:Noaa-walrus16.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Walruses on ice floes]]
Walruses prefer shallow shelf regions and forage on the sea bottom.  Their dives are not particularly deep compared to other pinnipeds (see [[elephant seals]] for example); the deepest recorded dives are around 80 m (300 [[foot (length)|ft]]).  However, they can remain submerged for as long as a half hour. 

Walruses have a highly diverse and opportunistic diet, feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms including shrimp, crabs, [[tube worms]], soft coral, [[tunicates]], [[sea cucumbers]], various [[mollusks]], and even parts of other [[pinnipeds]].  However, they display great preference for [[benthic]] [[Bivalvia|bivalve mollusks]], especially species of [[clam]], for which they forage by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with their sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements 
<ref> Levermann, N., Galatius, A., Ehlme, G., Rysgaard, S. and Born, E.W. (2003)
Feeding behaviour of free-ranging walruses with notes on apparent dextrality of flipper use
BMC Ecology 2003 3:9.  http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/3/9/ </ref>.  Walruses suck the meat out by sealing the organism in the powerful lips and drawing the tongue, piston-like, rapidly into the mouth, creating a vacuum.  The walrus palate is unique vaulted, allowing for extremely effective suction to be generated by the tongue. 

Aside from the large numbers of organisms actually consumed by walruses, they have a large peripheral impact on the benthic communities while foraging.  They disturb (''bioturbate'') the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increase the patchiness of the benthos <ref> Ray, C., McCormick-Ray, J., Berg, P., Epstein, H.E., (2006). Pacific Walrus: Benthic bioturbator of Beringia, Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 403-419.</ref>

[[Seal]] tissue has been observed in fairly significant proportion of walrus stomachs in the Pacific, but the importance of seal in the walrus diet is debated.<ref> Lowry, L.F. and Frost, K.J. 1981. Feeding and Trophic Relationships of Phocid Seals and Walruses in the Eastern Bering Sea. (in: The Eastern Bering Sea Shelf: Oceanography & Resources vol. 2. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). University of Washington Press. 1981 : 813-824).</ref>  There have been rare documented incidences of predation on seabirds <ref>  Mallory, M.L., Woo, K., Gaston, A.J.,  Davies, W.E.,  and Mineau, P (2004). Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) predation on adult thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) at Coats Island, Nunavut, Canada Polar Research 23 (1), 111–114. </ref>.  

Due to their great size, walruses have only two natural enemies: the [[orca]] and the [[polar bear]]. They do not, however, comprise a significant component of either predator's diet.  Polar bears hunt walruses by rushing at beached aggregations and consuming those individuals that are crushed or wounded in the sudden mass exodus, typically younger or infirm animals.<ref> Ovsyanikov, N. 1992. Ursus ubiquitous. BBC Wildlife. 10(12) : 18-26. </ref> However, even an injured walrus is a formidable opponent for a polar bear, and direct attacks are rare.

==Exploitation and Status==

[[Image:PolarBearWalrusTuskCarving.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Walrus tusk engraving made by [[Chukchi]] artisans depicting polar bears attacking walruses. On display in the Magadan Regional Museum, [[Magadan]], Russia.]]

In the 18th and 19th centuries, walruses were heavily exploited by American and European [[sealers]], leading to the near extirpation of the Atlantic population.  Commercial harvest of walrus is now outlawed throughout its range, though a traditional subsistence hunt continues among [[Chukchi]], [[Yupik]] and [[Inuit]] peoples.  The walrus hunt occurs towards the end of the summer.  Traditionally, all parts of the walrus was used.  The meat, often preserved, is an important source of nutrition through the winter; the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered for warmth and light; the tough hide is used for rope and house and boat coverings; the intestines and gut linings are used for making waterproof parkas; etc.  While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets and tusk carving and engraving remain a highly vital art form among many communities.  

Walrus hunts are regulated by resource managers in [[Russia]], the [[U.S.]], [[Canada]] and [[Denmark]] and representatives of the respective walrus hunting communities.  An estimated four to seven thousand Pacific walruses are harvested in Alaska and Russia, including a significant portion (approx. 42%) of struck and lost animals <ref> Garlich-Miller, J.G. and D.M. Burn. 1997. Estimating the harvest of Pacific walrus, ''Odobenus rosmarus divergens'', in Alaska. Fish. Bull. 97 (4):1043-1046. </ref>.  Several hundred are removed annually around Greenland <ref> Witting, L. and Born, E. W. 2005.  An assessment of Greenland walrus populations. ICES Journal of Marine Science. 62(2):266-284. </ref>.  The sustainability of these levels of harvest are difficult to determine since there is considerable uncertainty in the population estimates themselves and in the population parameters such as [[fecundity]] and [[mortality]].  

The effects of [[global climate change]] on walrus populations is another element of concern.  In particular, there have been well-documented reductions on the extent and thickness of the pack ice which the walrus rely on as a substrate for giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period.  It is hypothesized that thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of suitable resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds.  This causes greater separation of lactating females from their calves leading to nutritional stress for the young or lower reproductive rates for the females.<ref> Kaufman, M. April 15, 2006. “Warming Arctic Is Taking a Toll, Peril to Walrus Young Seen as Result of
Melting Ice Shelf” Washington Post, p.A7 (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/
content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401368.html)</ref>  However, there are as yet little data to make reliable predictions on the impacts of changing climate conditions on total population trends.  

Currently, none of the walrus populations are listed as "least-concern" by the [[IUCN]]; nor are the Pacific walrus listed as "depleted" according to the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act]] or as "threatened" or "endangered" under the [[Endangered Species Act]].  The Russian Atlantic and Laptev Sea populations are classified as Category 2 (decreasing) and Category 3 (rare) in the Russian [[Red Data Book of the Russian Federation|Red Book]].  Global trade in walrus ivory is restricted according to a [[CITES]] Appendix 3 listing.

==Etymology==
The origins of the word "walrus" has variously been attributed to combinations of the Dutch words for "whale" ''walvis'' and "horse" ''ros''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/walrus] or "shore" ''wal'' and "giant" ''reus''[http://www.iberianature.com/trivia/etymology_mammals.htm].  However, the most likely origin of the word is Old Norse ''hrossvalr'' "horse-whale", which was passed in a juxtaposed form to Dutch and the North-German dialects of the Hanseatic league as walros, Walross [Dansk Etymologisk Ordbog, Niels Age Nielsen, Gyldendal 1966].

The compound '''''Odobenus''''' comes from ''odous'' (Greek for "tooth") and ''baino'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "walk"), based on observations of walruses using their tusks to pull themselves out of the water. ''Divergens'' in [[Latin]] means "turning apart", referring to the tusks.
