'''''QI''''', standing for ''Quite Interesting'', is a comedy [[panel game]] television [[quiz show]] created and produced by [[John Lloyd]], hosted by [[Stephen Fry]], and featuring regular panellist [[Alan Davies]], who has appeared on every episode. It is broadcast on [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC Four]], while older, syndicated episodes are shown on [[UKTV G2]]. ''QI'' is notable for having the highest viewing figures for any show on BBC Four.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/tv/audience.php QI.com] Audience figures. Accessed [[21 June]], [[2007]].</ref>

It is distinguished by the awarding of points not necessarily for the ''correct'' answer, but rather, for an ''interesting'' one. This is because many of the questions and answers are extremely obscure, therefore it is unlikely that the correct answer will be given. Points are also deducted from a panellist who gives an ''obvious but wrong'' (that is to say, boring or conventional) answer, typically one that is generally accepted as true but is, in fact, false. This is refered to as ''General Ignorance''. It is therefore possible (and quite likely) that a panellist will have a negative point score at the end of the game.

== Format and Conception ==
[[Image:QI Logo.png|thumb|right|The QI Logo.]]
The panel consists of four panellists: three rotating and one regular, Alan Davies, who has the seat to Stephen Fry's right. Despite the fact that Davies has appeared in every episode, he has only won three times: since he generally offers up most of the "obvious but wrong" answers, he frequently finishes in last place. Most of the show's other panellists come from a [[stand-up comedy]] background, although there have also been entertainment personalities from many fields, including [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]], and [[Gyles Brandreth]].

Questions are sometimes misleading or fiendishly difficult. Providing an "obvious but wrong" answer results in a sequence of [[klaxon]]s. In the first and second series, Fry produced the answer on a card to show the panellists, while it also flashed on the large screens behind them (excepting the very first episode, when only the cards were used).<ref>{{cite episode | title = Series A, Episode 1 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (A series) | airdate = 2003-09-11 | season = A | number = 1 }}</ref> In the third series and onward, Fry's answer cards were dispensed with altogether, leaving only the screens as proof that the answers given had been predicted.

Because of the show's expectation that hardly anyone would be able to give a correct answer without significant prompting, it instead encourages sheer interestingness, which is how points are mainly scored.<ref name="Factoid">''QI Series 1 DVD'' Factoids</ref> As such, tangential discussions and even complete non sequiturs abound on the show, for panellists are apt to branch off into frivolous conversations, give voice to train of thought, and share humorous anecdotes from their own lives.<ref name="Factoid"/> The number of points given and taken away are normally decided by Fry, though some answers are allocated penalties before hand, especially if the points given or taken are very large. For example, one episode asked, "What is the main ingredient of air?" If someone answered, "[[Carbon dioxide]]" then, 3,000 points would have been deducted, but luckily no-one gave this answer. However, Davies was deducted 10 points for saying, "[[Oxygen]]".<ref name="SAE4">{{cite episode | title = Series A, Episode 4 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (A series) | airdate = 2003-10-02 | season = A | number = 4}}</ref> Fry once said:

<blockquote>"Now, the rules are simple. Points are given and points are taken away. They are taken away for answers which are both obvious and wrong, and are they're given not so much for being correct as for being interesting. Their level of interestingness is impartially determined by a demographically selected customer-service focus consultany, broken down by age and sex - i.e. me. Because there is no-one more broken down by age and sex than me."<ref name="SAE10">{{cite episode | title = Series A, Episode 10 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (A series) | airdate = 2003-11-13 | season = A | number = 10}}</ref></blockquote>

John Lloyd, ''QI's'' creator has admited that not even he has any idea on how the scoring system works, but there is someone who is paid to check on the scores. Guests are allowed the right of appeal if they believe their score is wrong, but no-one has done this so far.<ref name="Factoid"/>

=== Buzzers ===
Each of the panel has a [[buzzer]], the sound of which is often based along some sort of theme. The sounds are demonstrated at the beginning of the programme, but are sometimes changed in some way the very next time they are used. Davies's buzzer usually contradicts the others' in some amusing way.  Davies's buzzer has been the last to be demonstrated in every episode except for the unbroadcast pilot, in which he went first and [[Eddie Izzard]], with a sillier buzzer, went last.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Pilot | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (A series)}}</ref>

=== General Ignorance ===
{{seealso|The Book of General Ignorance}}
[[Image:QIfront.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Stephen Fry presenting an episode of ''QI''.]]
In a parody of ubiquitous [[general knowledge]] quizzes, the final round is off-topic and called "General Ignorance", focusing upon seemingly easy questions which have ''obvious but wrong'' answers. Whereas in the main rounds of the show, the panellists' use of buzzers is not usually enforced, the "General Ignorance" questions are introduced by Fry's reminder to keep "fingers on buzzers."

Due to the large number of "obvious but wrong" answers, panellists usually incur the greatest point losses in this round. In the second series' Christmas episode, Davies stated his refusal to participate in General Ignorance, saying that he "will not ''be'' humiliated at Christmas". In response, Fry offered to switch places with him, to the delight of the audience. Despite the seeming spontaneity of the swap, it was undoubtedly pre-planned (at least on the part of Davies and the producers), as evidenced by the fact that Davies, in turn, produced his own set of questions on loose-leaf paper, most of which he directed at Fry. At the end of the show, Fry announced that the game's loser was, in fact, he himself, as a result of his falling into many of Davies's traps.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Christmas Special | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (B series) | airdate = 2004-12-26 | season = B | number = 12 }}</ref>

=== Extra Tasks ===
In some episodes, panellists are given an extra task to complete during the course of the game. Those who do the best are often awarded extra points. Sometimes the task is as simple as competing in a drawing contest;<ref>{{cite episode | title = Series B, Episode 10 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (B series) | airdate = 2004-12-10 | season = B | number = 10 }}</ref> other times, the panel are told to look for a specific hidden thing over the course of the show, such as a [[squirrel]]<ref>{{cite episode | title = Series C, Episode 11 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (C series) | airdate = 2005-12-09 | season = C | number = 11 }}</ref> or a [[cuttlefish]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = Series C, Episode 9 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (C series) | airdate = 2005-11-25 | season = C | number = 9 }}</ref>

==Production==
[[Image:QI Davies.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Alan Davies on ''QI''.]]
Writer and former [[BBC]] producer [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] devised the format of the show, and it is produced by Quite Interesting Ltd., an organisation set up by Lloyd. ''QI'' was originally as being an "Annotated [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]… the world's first non-boring encyclopedia."<ref name="Factoid"/> As a panel game, it was conceived as a radio show, with Lloyd as chairman. When it was decided that the show would air on television, [[Michael Palin]] was offered the job of chairman with Fry and Davies as captains of "clever" and "stupid" teams, respectively.<ref>[http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/21/4850/last_among_eqials Chortle.co.uk "Last among eQIals"] Written [[21 December]], [[2006]]. Accessed [[21 June]], [[2007]].</ref>

The research for the show is mostly carried out by the [[Cultural impact of QI#The QI Elves|QI Elves]]. The elves also devise the questions, and are sometimes even contact the show part way through to provide and even correct information given by the contestants.<ref name="Elves">[http://www.qi.com/about/people.php#elves www.qi.com] The QI Elves, accessed [[17 January]] [[2007]]</ref> Other people involved in researching questions are John Mitchinson and Piers Fletcher, known as the ''Question Wranglers''.<ref name="Elves"/>

The theme tune was composed by [[Howard Goodall]], who has twice appeared as a panellist on the show. The theme music was originally going to be the song [[Wonderful World (song)|Wonderful World]], sung by [[Herman's Hermits]], which was used in the unbroadcast pilot. However, they were forbidden the use of the song, and the DVD recording of the pilot now uses the theme music composed by Goodall.<ref name="Factoid"/>

The makers of the show insist that the questions are not given to the panellists beforehand so that they can rehearse them.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/tv/ www.qi.com] QI: The BBC Television Series. Accessed [[27 July]], [[2007]].</ref> The panel are given a list of questions set to be asked just about an hour before the show, and before recording starts, they run through a series of "warm up" questions; this is the only assistance the panellists receive. They are forbidden to ask for preparatory materials or other help.<ref name="Factoid"/> It is known that Davies never does any preparation at all.<ref name="Factoid"/> The show also uses a warm-up comedian before recording begins. In the forthcoming series, [[Stephen Grant (comedian)|Stephen Grant]]<ref>[http://www.stephengrant.com/sg_television.htm#warmup Stephen Grant.com, Warm Up] Accessed [[23 June]], [[2007]].</ref> provided the warm-up for 10 of the 12 episodes, and [[Gordon Southern]] did so for the other two.

==Episodes==
{{seealso|List of QI episodes}}

In ''QI'', every series is themed around a different letter of the alphabet, starting with the letter "A". Series are therefore referred to by letter rather than number. The first series started on [[11 September]], [[2003]], and consisted of topics beginning with A, including a round on people called "Alan". This might have been a factor in Davies winning this particular episode.<ref name="SAE10"/> The second series consisted of topics beginning with "B", except in two episodes, one about "Music"<ref>{{cite episode | title = Music | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (B series) | airdate = 2004-12-17 | season = B | number = 11}}</ref> and one about "Colour".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Colour | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (B series) | airdate = 2004-10-08 | season = B | number = 1}}</ref> Series D differed from the previous three as all episodes focused upon a single "D" topic (with subsidiary lines of inquiry), examples of which included "Danger"<ref>{{cite episode | title = Danger | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (D series) | airdate = 2006-09-29 | season = D | number = 1}}</ref> and a special Halloween episode themed on "Death", which is notable for being the only episode of ''QI'' so far which was won by the audience.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Death | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (D series) | airdate = 2006-10-27 | season = D | number = 5}}</ref>

==Highlights==

===Pluto and Cruithne===
The questions are, as in many comedy panel games, mainly created to set up jokes or discussions, rather than for any serious competition. Certain questions are purposely contradictory to established doctrine for the sake of entertainment. For example, to the question "How many planets are there in the solar system?", Davies gave the answer "Nine" and lost points for an "obvious but wrong" answer, the explanation being that at the time a debate was occurring over whether [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]] was indeed a planet (see ''[[2006 definition of planet]]''). However, as the [[International Astronomical Union]] still defined Pluto as a planet at the time of questioning, the answer "nine" ''would'' have been a "correct" answer, if one accepted the contemporaneous IAU definition.<ref name="SAE2">{{cite episode | title = Series A, Episode 2 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (A series) | airdate = 2003-09-18 | season = A | number = 2}}</ref>

A further example of this purposeful contradiction occurred during the second series, when the question "How many moons does the Earth have?" was asked. Davies had, in the previous series, been given a penalty for answering "One" to the same question, due to the presence of the [[asteroid]] [[3753 Cruithne|Cruithne]] which has an [[orbital resonance]] with Earth (although it is not normally defined as a [[natural satellite]]).<ref name="SAE2"/> This time, he was again given negative points for answering with "two", which was counted as correct during the first series. The change in answer was attributed to the recent discovery of new satellites ([[(54509) 2000 PH5|(54509) 2000 PH<sub>5</sub>]], [[(85770) 1998 UP1|(85770) 1998 UP<sub>1</sub>]] and [[2002 AA29|2002 AA<sub>29</sub>]]) that share a similar resonance to Cruithne with respect to the Earth.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Series B, Episode 6 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (B series) | airdate = 2004-11-12 | season = B | number = 6}}</ref>

===Luvvie Alarm===
A "Luvvie Alarm" has on occasion sounded when a guest blatantly [[name-dropping|name-drops]]. It was originally used on [[John Sessions]] when he name dropped [[Robert Redford]] in Series B.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Series B, Episode 10 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (B series) | airdate = 2005-12-10 | season = B | number = 10 }}</ref> It was later used on Fry when he mentioned a party he had attended hosted by the [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster|Duke and Duchess of Westminster]].<ref name="SCE10">{{cite episode | title = Series C, Episode 10 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (C series) | airdate = 2005-12-02 | season = C | number = 10 }} Note: As pointed out by guest [[Clive Anderson]], the Duke was (at the time of recording) the second richest man in the UK after [[Roman Abramovich]]; [[as of 2006]], he is currently third-richest after Abramovich and [[Lakshmi Mittal]]</ref>

===Corrections and mistakes===
At the end of the third series, [[Dara Ó Briain]] was deducted points for having stated, in the series before, that the [[triple point]] of [[water]] is zero degrees [[Celsius]], an answer which earned him 2 points at the time.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Series B, Episode 7 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (B series) | airdate = 2005-11-19 | season = B | number = 7 }}</ref> Some viewers, however, wrote in to say that the triple point of water is in fact ''0.01'' degrees, and so the 2 points awarded Dara in the previous series were revoked and he recieved a further deduction of 10 points for saying a now ''obvious answer''. Dara humorously retorted with, "How many people sat at home watching that and said, 'It's just a comedy show, but I'm not letting that [[feck]]er get away with that!?'"<ref>{{cite episode | title = Series C, Episode 12 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (C series) | airdate = 2005-12-16 | season = C | number = 12}}</ref>

Although most of the facts presented on the show are correct, there has been the occasional slip-up. Several facts given are often updated and corrected in later series. For example, in Series A, the show claimed that the longest animal in the world was the [[lion's mane jellyfish]],<ref>{{cite episode | title = Series A, Episode 3 | series = QI | serieslink = List of QI episodes (A series) | airdate = 2003-09-25 | season = A | number = 3 }}</ref> but this was later corrected in Series C, saying that the longest animal on the world is the [[Lineus longissimus|bootlace worm]].<ref name="SCE10"/>

==Culture==
{{main|Cultural impact of QI}}
''QI'' has had an impact on British culture. There have been several DVDs and books, most notably ''The Book of General Ignorance''. ''QI'' also has a building in [[Oxford]], a large website, and a column in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

''QI'' has its own [[philosophy]]. It states that everything in the world, even what appear to be the most boring things, are quite interesting, if looked at in the right way. The website states that:

<blockquote>
"We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet almost none of the information we think we possess is true. [[Eskimo|Eskimos]] do not rub noses. The [[rickshaw]] was invented by an American. [[Joan of Arc]] was not French. [[Lenin]] was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither [[haggis]], [[whisky]], [[porridge]], [[tartan|clan tartans]] nor [[kilt|kilts]] are [[Scotland|Scottish]]. So we stand, silent, on a peak in Darien: a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. QI country. Whatever is interesting we are interested in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at ''in the right way''. At one extreme, QI is serious, intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, silly and frothy enough to please the most indolent couch-potato."<ref>[http://www.qi.com/about/philosophy.php QI.com, Philosophy.] Accessed [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref>
</blockquote>

==Awards==
In [[2006]], Fry won the [[Rose d'Or]] for "Best Game Show Host".<ref>[http://www.talkbackthames.tv/?s=news&b=29&abc=2 talkbackThames, "Three Rose D'or wins for talkbackThames] Written [[1 May]], [[2006]].
