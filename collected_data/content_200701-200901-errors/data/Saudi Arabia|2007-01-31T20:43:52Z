The '''Kingdom of Saudi Arabia''' ({{lang-ar|<big>'''المملكة العربية السعودية'''</big>}}) is the largest country on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It borders [[Jordan]] on the northwest, [[Iraq]] on the north and northeast, [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] on the east, [[Oman]] on the southeast, and [[Yemen]] on the south, with the [[Persian Gulf]] to its northeast and the [[Red Sea]] to its west. It is called "the land of the two holy mosques", a reference to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], [[Islam]]'s two holiest places. In English, it is most commonly referred to as '''Saudi Arabia''' (pronounced /{{IPA|ˈsɒdɪ}}/ or  /{{IPA|ˈsaudɪ  əˈɹeɪ̯bɪə}}/), often as just '''Saudi''' by many English-speaking [[expatriate]]s in the kingdom, or, less commonly (as in international football events or in its national press — as established by U.S. oil and defense industry interests) as '''KSA'''.  '''[[Arabia]]''' is sometimes also used to refer to the nation, but the term can also refer to the entire peninsula and its varied nations, and sometimes the entire [[Arab world]], and is thus ambiguous. The [[Arabic]] short form is usually as-Sa'ūdiyya / السعودية .

Saudi Arabia is the world's leading [[Petroleum#Top_petroleum-producing_countries|petroleum producer and exporter]]. Oil accounts for more than 90% of exports and [[Economy_of_Saudi_Arabia#Oil_industry|nearly 75% of government revenues]], facilitating the creation of a [[welfare state]]<ref>http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm</ref><ref>http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=1516&InNewsItemID=1746</ref>, which the government has found difficult to fund during periods of low oil prices.<ref>http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=164957&Sn=BUSI&IssueID=29274</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Azizfdr.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The founder of modern Saudi Arabia, [[King Abdul Aziz]], converses with President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] on board a ship returning from the [[Yalta Conference]] in 1945.]]
{{main|History of Saudi Arabia}}
The emergence of a Saudi state began in central Arabia in 1744. A regional ruler, [[Muhammad bin Saud]], joined forces with an Islamic cleric and reformer, [[Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab|Muhammad Abd Al-Wahhab]], to create a new political entity. This alliance formed in the 18th Century remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today. Over the next 150 years, the fortunes of the Saud family rose and fell several times as Saudi rulers contended with Egypt, the [[Ottoman Empire]], and other Arabian families for control on the peninsula. The Saudi state was founded by the late King [[Abdul Aziz Al-Saud]] (known internationally as Abdul Aziz bin Saud).

In [[1902]] at the age of only 22, Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud re-captured [[Riyadh]], the Al-Saud dynasty's ancestral capital, from the rival [[Rashidi|Al-Rashid]] family. Continuing his conquests, Abdul Aziz subdued [[Al-Hasa]], [[Al-Qatif]], the rest of [[Nejd]], and the [[Hejaz]] between [[1913]] and [[1926]]. On [[8 January]] 1926 Abdul Aziz bin Saud became the King of Hejaz. On [[29 January]] [[1927]] he took the title King of Nejd (his previous Nejdi title was Sultan). By the [[Treaty of Jedda]], signed on [[20 May]] 1927, the [[United Kingdom]] recognized the independence of Abdul Aziz's realm, then known as the Kingdom of [[Hejaz]] and [[Nejd]]. In [[1932]] the 3 principle regions of Al-Hasa, the Nejd and the Hejaz were unified to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Abdul Aziz's military and political successes were not mirrored economically until vast reserves of [[Petroleum|oil]] were discovered in March [[1938]].  Development programmes, which were delayed due to the onset of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, began in earnest in 1946 and by 1949 production was in full swing. Oil has provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and a great deal of leverage in the international community.

Internationally Abdul Aziz initially chose to follow an isolationist policy. He refused to allow Saudi Arabia to join the League of Nations and from 1916 until his death in 1953 chose to leave his kingdom on only three occasions. One of which was the meeting with President Roosevelt pictured above. Eventually however Abdul Aziz acceded to the realities of world politics and in 1945 Saudi Arabia became a founding member of the [[Arab League]] and joined the [[United Nations]].

Prior to his death in 1953 Abdul Aziz, aware of the difficulties facing other regional absolute rulers reliant on extended family networks, attempted to regulate the succession. He took steps to provide that his eldest son, Saud, would become king but that he would be required to work closely with his more financially and diplomatically astute brother, Faisal.

Saud succeeded to the throne on his father's death in 1953. However by the early 1960's the Kingdom was in jeopardy due to Saud's economic mismanagement and his failure to deal effectively with a regional challenge from [[President Nasser]] of Egypt. As a consequence Saud was deposed in favour of Faisal in 1964.

Intra-family rivalries led to the assassination of Faisal by his nephew, Prince Faisal bin Musaid, in 1975. He was succeded by Prince Faisal's brother, Prince Khalid bin Musaid until 1982 and then by [[King Fahd]]. When Fahd died in 2005, his half-brother [[Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia|Abdullah]] ascended to the throne.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Saudi Arabia}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
The central institution of the Saudi Arabian government is the [[Saudi monarchy]]. The ''Basic Law of Government'' adopted in [[1992]] declared that Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the sons and grandsons of the first king, [[Abd Al Aziz Al Saud]], it also claims that the [[Qur'an]] is the [[constitution]] of the country, which is governed on the basis of Islamic law ([[Shari'a]]) [http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/sa00000_.html].

[[Image:Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] of Saudi Arabia.]]
There are no recognized political parties or national elections, except the local elections which were held in the year [[2005]]. The king's powers are theoretically limited within the bounds of Shari'a and other Saudi traditions. He also must retain a consensus of the Saudi royal family, religious leaders (''[[ulema]]''), and other important elements in Saudi society. The Saudi government spreads [[Islam]] by funding construction of mosques and [[Madrassa|Qur'an schools]] around the world. The leading members of the royal family choose the king from among themselves with the subsequent approval of the ulema.

Saudi kings have gradually developed a central government. Since [[1953]], the Council of Ministers, appointed by and responsible to the king, has advised on the formulation of general policy and directed the activities of the growing bureaucracy. This council consists of a prime minister, the first prime minister and twenty ministers.

Legislation is by resolution of the Council of Ministers, ratified by [[Decree|royal decree]], and must be compatible with the Shari'a. Justice is administered according to the Shari'a by a system of religious courts whose judges are appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council, composed of twelve senior jurists. Independence of the judiciary is protected by law. The king acts as the highest court of appeal and has the power to pardon.  Access to high officials (usually at a ''majlis''; a public audience) and the [[right to petition]] them directly are well-established traditions.

The combination of relatively high oil prices and exports led to a revenues windfall for Saudi Arabia during [[2004]] and early 2005. For 2004 as a whole, Saudi Arabia earned about $116 billion in net oil export revenues, up 35 percent from [[2003]] revenue levels. Saudi net oil export revenues are forecast to increase in 2005 and [[2006]], to $150 billion and $154 billion, respectively, mainly due to higher oil prices. Increased oil prices and consequent revenues since the price collapse of 1998 have significantly improved Saudi Arabia's economic situation, with real GDP growth of 5.2 percent in 2004, and forecasts of 5.7 percent and 4.8 percent growth for 2005 and 2006, respectively. 

For [[fiscal year]] 2004, Saudi Arabia originally had been expecting a [[Deficit|budget deficit]]. However, this was based on an extremely conservative price assumption of $19 per barrel for Saudi oil and an assumed production of 7.7 million bbl/d<!--barrels per day?-->. Both of these estimates turned out to be far below actual levels. As a result, as of mid-December 2004, the Saudi Finance Ministry was expecting a huge budget surplus of $26.1 billion, on budget revenues of $104.8 billion (nearly double the country's original estimate) and expenditures of $78.6 billion (28 percent above the approved budget levels). This surplus is being used for several purposes, including: paying down the Kingdom's public debt (to $164 billion from $176 billion at the start of 2004); extra spending on education and development projects; increased security expenditures (possibly an additional $2.5 billion dollars in 2004; see below) due to threats from terrorists; and higher payments to Saudi citizens through subsidies (for housing, education, health care, etc.). For 2005, Saudi Arabia is assuming a balanced budget, with revenues and expenditures of $74.6 billion each. 

In spite of the recent surge in its oil income, Saudi Arabia continues to face serious long-term economic challenges, including high rates of unemployment (around 13 percent of Saudi nationals, possibly higher), one of the world's fastest population growth rates, and the consequent need for increased government spending. All of these place pressures on Saudi oil revenues. The Kingdom also is facing serious security threats, including a number of terrorist attacks (on foreign workers, primarily) in 2003 and 2004. In response, the Saudis reportedly have ramped up spending in the security area (reportedly by 50 percent in 2004, from $5.5 billion in 2003). Saudi Arabia's per capita oil export revenues remain far below high levels reached during the 1970s and early 1980s. In 2004, Saudi Arabia earned around $4,564 per person, versus $22,589 in 1980. This 80 percent decline in real per capita oil export revenues since 1980 is in large part due to the fact that Saudi Arabia's young population has nearly tripled since 1980, while oil export revenues in real terms have fallen by over 40 percent (despite recent increases).  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has faced nearly two decades of heavy budget and trade deficits, the expensive 1990-1991 war with Iraq, and total public debt of around $175 billion. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia does have extensive foreign assets (around $110 billion) which provide a substantial fiscal "cushion." 

[[Saudi Arabia municipal elections, 2005|Saudi municipal elections]] took place in 2005 and some commentators saw this a first tentative step towards the introduction of [[democratic]] processes in the Kingdom, including the legalization of political parties. Other analysts of the Saudi political scene were more skeptical.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4252079.stm</ref>

====Legal System====
{{main|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia does not have much of a formal [[criminal code]], and thus much of its law is derived from an ultra-conservative form of [[Sunni]] Islam commonly known as [[Wahhabism]]. To that end judges are free to impose [[capital punishment]],  [[corporal punishment]], including [[amputation]]s of hands and feet for certain crimes such as [[murder]], [[robbery]], rape, drug smuggling and for various forms of sexual behavior such as [[homosexuality]] and [[adultery]].  The courts may impose less severe punishments, such as [[flogging]]s, for less serious crimes against [[public morality]] such as [[drunkenness]] [<ref>http://hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/saudi/saudi.pdf</ref>].

The punishments, especially the executions, are carried out in public in order to add [[humiliation]] to the convicted person and also to act as a deterrence.  Judges are generally given a tremendous amount of discretion in deciding how to punish a particular individual, and will make such decisions based on the particular school of Islam that they follow.  For example;  

[[Theft]] is punishable by the amputation-only if the theft is not poor and the stolen money is not from public sources or a company (must be a private secure money that was stolen by well-off adult)- of the right hand. If the right hand has already been amputated, the left hand is chosen instead. 

Drinking, selling, or buying [[alcohol]] and sniffing drugs or injecting [[drugs]] is punished by a sentence of eighty lashes. Smuggling [[heroin]] or [[cocaine]] into the country is punished by death (beheading with a sword). 

[[Fornication]] - if proven by four righteous witnesses - is normally punished with forty lashes, as is adultery. During flogging, the face, head and vital organs of the person are protected. 

Murder, accidental death and bodily harm are open to punishment from the victim's family. Retribution may be sought in kind or through [[Blood money (term)#In Islam|blood money]]. The blood money payable for a woman's accidental death is half as much as that for a man. <ref>http://www.jeansasson.com/law_and_government.htm</ref>

===Human Rights===

Several international [[human rights]] organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]] and the [[United Nations]] Human Rights Committee have issued reports critical of the Saudi legal system and its human rights record in various political, legal, and social areas.  The Saudi government typically dismisses such reports as being outright lies or asserts that its actions are based on its adherence to Islamic law.

In [[2002]], the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Committee against Torture]] criticized Saudi Arabia over the amputations and floggings it carries out under the Shari'a. The Saudi delegation responded defending "legal traditions" held since the inception of Islam in the region 1400 years ago and rejected "interference" in its legal system.

==Opposition Movements==

The two most prominent opposition groups in the kingdom are:

- [[Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia]]<br />
- [[Al-Qaeda]]

==Provinces==
[[Image:SaudiArabiaNumbered.png|right|260px|Provinces of Saudi Arabia]]{{main|Provinces of Saudi Arabia}}

==Geography==
[[Image:Saudi Arabia map.png|thumb|right|Map of Saudi Arabia]]
{{main|Geography of Saudi Arabia}}
The kingdom occupies eighty percent of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Most of the country's boundaries with the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Oman]], and [[Yemen]] are not precisely defined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government's estimate is 2,217,949&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]] (856,356&nbsp;[[square miles|mi²]]). Other reputable estimates vary between 1,960,582&nbsp;km²[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html] (756,934&nbsp;mi²) and 2,240,000&nbsp;km² (864,869&nbsp;mi²). The kingdom is commonly listed as the world's  14th largest nation.

Its geography is surprisingly varied. From the western coastal region ([[At-Tihamah]]), the land rises from sea level to a peninsula-long mountain range (jabal al-Hijaz) beyond which are plateaus.  The southwestern 'Asir region has mountains as high as 3,000 metres (9,840&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) and is known for having the greenest and freshest climate in all of the country, one that attracts many Saudis to resorts such as [[Abha]] in the summer months.  The east is primarily rocky or sandy lowland continuing to the shores of the [[Persian Gulf]].  The geographically hostile "Empty Quarter" along the country's imprecisely defined southern borders contains the nearly lifeless [[Rub' al-Khali]] desert.

In line with common stereotypes, much of the nation's landmass consists of [[desert]] and [[Semi-arid|semi-desert]], which, except for its dwindling traditional [[bedouin]] population, is mostly uninhabited. In these parts of the country, vegetation is limited to weeds, [[xerophytic]] herbs and shrubs. Less than 2% of the kingdom's total area is suitable for cultivation. Population centers are mainly located along the eastern and western coasts and densely populated interior oases such as [[Hofuf]] and [[Buraydah]].  In some extended areas, primarily the Rub' al-Khali and the [[Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands]], there is no population whatsoever, although the petroleum industry is constructing a few planned communities there. Saudi Arabia has no permanent year-round rivers or lakes; however, its coastline extends for 2,640 kilometers (1,640&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) and, on the [[Red Sea]] side, offers world-class coral reefs, including those in the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. 

Native animals include the [[ibex]], [[Wild cat|wildcats]], [[baboons]], [[wolves]], and [[hyenas]] in the mountainous highlands. Small birds are found in the [[oasis|oases]]. The coastal area on the [[Red Sea]] with its [[coral reef]]s has a rich marine [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]].

===Climate===
Extreme heat and aridity are characteristic of most of Saudi Arabia. It is one of the few places in the world where summer temperatures above 50°C (120°F) are common, while in winter frost or snow can occur in the interior and the higher mountains, although this does not occur annually. The average winter temperature range is 8° to 20°C (47° to 68°F) in January in interior cities such as Riyadh and 19° to 29°C (66° to 83°F) in [[Jeddah]] on the Red Sea coast. The average summer range in July is 27° to 43°C (81° to 109°F) in Riyadh and 27° to 38°C (80° to 100°F) in Jeddah. Nighttime temperatures in the mid desert can be famously chilly even in summer, as sand gives up daytime heat rapidly once the sun has set.

Annual precipitation is usually sparse (up to 100 millimetres (4&nbsp;[[inches]]) in most regions), although sudden downpours can lead to violent [[flash flood]]s in wadis. Annual rainfall in Riyadh averages 100&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;inches) and falls almost exclusively between January and May; the average in Jeddah is 54&nbsp;mm (2.1&nbsp;inches) and occurs between November and January. Plants can still survive in Saudi Arabia, mostly in the south-east mountains and lowlands. They bloom mid-March through mid-May. The plants provide food for birds and insects.

==Economy==
[[Image:AramcoCoreArea.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]], the Saudi national oil company, whose main offices are in [[Dhahran]].]]
{{main|Economy of Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia's economy is petroleum-based; roughly 75% of budget revenues and 90% of export earnings come from the oil industry. The oil industry comprises about 45% of Saudi Arabia's [[gross domestic product]], compared with 40% from the private sector (see below). Saudi Arabia has claimed to be in possession of 260.1 billion barrels of [[oil reserves]] (about 24% of the world's proven total petroleum reserves) as of 2003. Moreover, according to the Saudi government, the proven reserves increase gradually as more [[oil field]]s are discovered, unlike most other oil-producing countries. It must be noted, however, that, those figures have been contested and that Saudi Arabia's actual reserves may be notably lower. Saudi Arabia was a key player in the successful efforts of OPEC and other oil producing countries to raise the price of oil in [[1999]] to its highest level since the [[Gulf War]] by reducing production.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sa.html#Econ</ref>

The government is attempting to promote growth in the private sector by privatizing industries such as power and telecom. Saudi Arabia announced plans to begin privatizing the electricity companies in [[1999]], which followed the ongoing privatization of the telecommunications company. Shortages of water and rapid population growth may constrain government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural products.

In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income has fallen from $25,000 in [[1980]] to $8,000 in [[2003]], up from about $7,000 in [[1999]]. The decline in inflation-adjusted [[Per capita income|per-capita income]] from 1980 to 1999 set a record, being by far the worst such decline suffered by any nation-state in history.

In 2003, the price of oil jumped to record high of 40 to 50 dollars, which triggered a second oil boom.  Saudi Arabia's budget surplus has crossed $28 billion (110SR billion) in 2005. [[Tadawul]] (the Saudi stock market Index) finished 2004 with a massive 76.23% to close at 4437.58 points. [[Market capitalization]] was up 110.14% from a year earlier to stand at $157.3 billion (589.93SR billion), which makes it the biggest stock market in the [[Middle East]].‏

OPEC limits its members oil production based on its "proven reserves."  The higher their reserves, the more OPEC allows them to produce.  Because of this, Saudi Arabia does not allow independent verification of their claimed "proven reserves."  Over the past fifteen years, Saudi Arabia's claimed reserves have been flat, with the exception of an increase of about 100 billion barrels between 1987 and 1988.  Many experts now believe that Saudi Arabia is greatly exaggerating its reserves and may soon show production declines (see [[Peak Oil]]).

To diversify the economy, Saudi Arabia launched a new city on the western coast with investments exceeding 26.6 billion dollars. The city which is named "[[King Abdullah Economic City]]" will be built near al-Rabegh industrial city north to Jeddah. The new city, where construction work started in December 2005, includes a port which is the largest port of the kingdom. Extending along a coastline of 35&nbsp;km, the city will also include petrochemical, pharmaceutical, tourism, finance and education and research areas.

Saudi Arabia officially became a [[WTO]] member in December 2005.

Saudi Arabia is a country in which many men and women from [[South Asia|South]], [[South East Asia|South East]], and [[East Asia]], [[East Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] seek work. There are also some people from [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Europe]]. Hundreds of thousands of low-[[skilled workers]] and skilled workers from regions of the [[Developing countries|developing world]] migrate to Saudi Arabia, sometimes only for a short period of time, to work.  Although exact figures are not known, skilled experts in the [[banking]] and services professions seek work in the Kingdom.

It is reported that some [[Foreign worker|guest workers]] present in the country (like in many countries) are sometimes subject to mistreatment, as documented by [[Human Rights Watch]]:

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia's population as of July 2006 is estimated to be about 27,019,731, including about 5,576,076 resident foreigners. Until the [[1960s]], most of the population was [[nomadic]] or semi-nomadic; due to rapid economic and urban growth, more than 95% of the population now is settled. The birth rate is 29.56 births per 1,000 people. The death rate is only 2.62 deaths per 1,000 people. Some cities and oases have densities of more than 1,000 people per square kilometre (2,600/sq&nbsp;mi).

Around 90% of Saudis are ethnically [[Arab]]. In addition, there are some citizens of [[Asian]] and [[sub-Saharan]]/[[East Africa]]n ancestry. There are some 7 million migrants from countries all around the world, including<ref>http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51609.htm</ref>: [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indian]]: 1.4 million, [[Bangladeshi]]: 1 million, [[Filipino people|Filipino]]: 950,000, [[Pakistan|Pakistani]]: 900,000, and [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]]: 750,000. Many Arabs from nearby countries are employed in the kingdom. There are around 100,000 [[Westerners]] in Saudi Arabia, most of whom live in [[Compound (fortification)|compound]]s or [[gated communities]]. 

The Saudi government states that all citizens must be Muslim. The majority of the population adheres to a strict theological interpretation within Islam most commonly known as [[Salafi]] or  [[Wahhabism]]. The [[Shia Population]] of the country is estimated at around 15%<ref>http://www.cfr.org/publication/10903/shiite_muslims_in_the_middle_east.html</ref>, primarily in the Eastern provinces, and larger cities.

The country allows religious minorities such as [[Christians]] and [[Hindus]] to enter the country as temporary workers, but does not allow them to practice their faiths. The U.S. State departments suggest that there are 500,000 to 1 million people who adhere to the [[Catholic]] faith.<ref>http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51609.htm</ref>

==Education==
At the time the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932, education was not accessible to everyone and limited to individualized instruction at religious schools in mosques in urban areas. These schools taught Islamic law and basic literacy skills. By the end of the century, Saudi Arabia had a nationwide educational system providing free training from preschool through university to all citizens. The modern Saudi educational system provides quality instruction in diverse fields of modern and traditional arts and sciences. This diversity helps meet the Kingdom's growing need for highly-educated citizens to build on its rapid progress.  

Formal primary education began in Saudi Arabia in the 1930s. By 1945, King Abdulaziz bin Abdelrahman Al-Saud, the country's founder, had initiated an extensive program to establish schools in the Kingdom. Six years later, in 1951, the country had 226 schools with 29,887 students. In 1954, the Ministry of Education was established, headed by then Prince Fahd bin Abdulaziz as the first Minister of Education. The first university, now known as King Saud University, was founded in Riyadh in 1957.

Today, Saudi Arabia's nationwide public educational system comprises eight universities, more than 24,000 schools, and a large number of colleges and other educational and training institutions. Open to every citizen, the system provides students with free education, books and health services. Over 25 percent of the annual State budget is for education including vocational training. The Kingdom has also worked on scholarship programs to send students overseas, mainly to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]] and other nations. Over the past couple of years, thousands of students have been sent to higher-educations programs each year.

The study of Islam remains at the core of the Saudi educational system.  The Islamic aspect of the  Saudi national curriculum is examined in a recent report by [[Freedom House]].<ref>http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/news/bn2005/bn-2005-2006-05-23.htm</ref>  The report finds how, in religious education classes, children are taught to deprecate other religions, in addition to other branches of Islam.  The discussion of other religions in a favourable light is forbidden. The Saudi religious studies curriculum is taught outside the Kingdom in [[madrassas]] throughout the world.

==Sports==
Sports are a very popular pastime for the young men. Women rarely participate in sports, usually in indoor stadium where the presence of men is minimal, if not nil. Even though football is the most played game, Saudi Arabia has participated in many world games such as the [[summer Olympics]], [[volleyball]], [[basketball]] and other sports. The [[Saudi Arabia national football team|national football team]] is most known for qualifying in four consecutive times in the [[FIFA World Cup]] and six times at the [[Asian Cup]], which the team won three times and was runner-up two times.  Some popular football players include [[Majed Abdullah]], [[Mohamed Al-Deayea]], [[Sami Al Jaber]], [[Saeed Al-Owairan]],and [[Ahmed Jameel]].,.

{{main|Culture of Saudi Arabia|Music of Saudi Arabia|Islam in Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabian culture revolves almost entirely around the religion of [[Islam]]. Islam's two holiest sites, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], are located in the country. Every day, five times a day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which dot the country. The weekend consists of Thursday and Friday. The public practice of any religion other than Islam, including Christianity and Judaism, the presence of churches, and open possession of Christian religious materials are outlawed in Saudi Arabia. 

One of Saudi Arabia's most compelling folk rituals is the [[Al Ardha]], the country's national dance. This [[sword dance]] is based on ancient [[Bedouin]] traditions: drummers beat out a rhythm and a poet chants verses while sword-carrying men dance shoulder to shoulder. [[Al-sihba]] folk music, from the [[Hijaz]], has its origins in Arab [[Andalusia]], a region of medieval [[Spain]]. In [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jeddah]], dance and song incorporate the sound of the [[al-mizmar]], an [[oboe]]-like [[woodwind instrument]]. The [[drum]] is also an important instrument according to traditional and tribal customs.

Saudi Arabian dress is strongly symbolic, representing the people's ties to the land, the past, and Islam. The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering garments reflect the practicalities of life in a desert country as well as Islam's emphasis on conservative dress. Traditionally, men usually wear an ankle-length shirt woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[shimagh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by a cord coil) or a [[ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by a cord coil) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a camel-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. Women's clothes are decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques. However, Saudi women must wear a long cloak ([[abaya]]) and veil ([[niqab]]) when they leave the house to protect their [[modesty]]. The law does not apply to foreigners at such a high degree, but both men and women are told to dress modestly.  

Islam forbids the eating of [[pork]] and the drinking of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and this law is enforced strictly throughout Saudi Arabia. Arabic unleavened bread, or [[Khubz|khobz]], is eaten with almost all meals. Other staples include cooked lamb, grilled [[chicken]], [[falafel]] (deep-fried [[chickpea]] balls), [[shawarma]] (spit-cooked sliced [[lamb]]), and [[fuul]] (a paste of [[fava bean]]s, [[garlic]] and [[lemon]]). Traditional [[coffee]] houses used to be ubiquitous, but are now being displaced by food-hall style cafes. Arabic tea is also a famous custom, which is used in both casual and formal meetings between friends, family and even strangers. The tea is black (without milk) and has herbal flavoring that comes in many variations.

Public theatres and [[movie theater|cinemas]] are prohibited, as [[Wahabbi]] tradition deems those institutions to be incompatible with [[Islam]]. However, in private compounds such as [[Dhahran]] and [[Ras Tanura]] public theaters can be found, but often are more popular for local music, arts, and theatre productions rather than the exhibition of motion pictures. Recently, plans for some cinemas that will be allowed  to feature Arabic cartoons for women and children were announced. Videos and DVDs of popular American movies are legal
The cultural heritage is celebrated at the annual [[Jenadriyah]] Cultural festival. During this event, the Saudi national cake, [[carrot cake]], is handed out to visitors.
