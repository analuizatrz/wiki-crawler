[[Image:Floodforms library.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Halo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] encounters various flood forms on Installation 04.]]
The '''Flood''' is a fictional [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[parasite|parasitic]] life form in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game series. They are introduced in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as a secondary enemy to the game's protagonist, [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], and return in ''[[Halo 2]]''. They are depicted as highly [[virulent]] and deadly, and with the ability to quickly incapacitate and infect their victims. The Flood mutate their hosts into several different forms to serve different purposes. All of these forms have an attraction to any lifeform of sufficient mass to accommodate them and will try to attack or infect any potential host they encounter. 

The Flood make their first appearance in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sixth level, "343 Guilty Spark."<!-- The Flood is not a level, it's a chapter in 343 GS --> After reaching [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]]'s control room in the previous mission, Master Chief is sent by the AI [[Cortana]] to try and stop [[List of Halo series characters#Captain Jacob Keyes|Captain Jacob Keyes]] and his [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]] Marines from reaching a weapons cache they believed was hidden in a [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] structure by a swamp. In reality, the cache is false intelligence; instead of finding weapons, Keyes finds that a sizable population of Flood has been released from [[stasis]] by the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]]. The Flood quickly escape containment and spread across the ringworld, threatening not only Humanity and the Covenant, but also the entire galaxy if they escape.

==Overview==
===Life cycle===
In the game, the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of the Flood begins at the Infection form stage, as a small, frail, creature. These creatures leap upon a potential host and attempt to drive in three barbed tentacles. Small spores that some Flood release are also used to either infect or incapacitate potential hosts, as the character [[343 Guilty Spark]] explains during the level "The Library" in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halosm.bungie.org/story/level_transcripts/lv07_library.html|title= ''Halo'' Story Page Level Transcripts|work=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=Mar 10|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The infection form burrows into the host, who quickly loses motor functions and control, and begins mutating the host body.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=140}}</ref> If the host is of a suitable size, the infection form mutates the host into a Combat form.<ref name=h295>{{cite book |author= Piggyback||title=''Halo 2: The Official Strategy Guide: The Flood]''|year= 2004|publisher= Piggyback Interactive Ltd.|location=United States |isbn=0-7615-4473-9|pages=95}}</ref> If the host is not of sufficient size, or is not useful in battle, the next stage of mutation occurs. The upper body swells and incubates new Infection forms, creating a Carrier form. When the Carrier Form detects a suitable host in their proximity, they explode, releasing the Infection forms inside of them to continue the cycle.<ref name=h295 />

===Origins===
{{seealso|Forerunners (Halo)}}
The origins of the Flood have never been fully explained by ''Halo'' media. In ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' the player learns that the ring they are playing on, [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 04|Halo]], was built by the [[Forerunners (Halo)|Forerunners]] to contain the Flood, as well as being a weapon of last resort if the Flood were to escape.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': The installation was specifically built to study and contain the Flood. Their survival as a race was dependent upon it. I am grateful to see that some of them survived to reproduce. - {{cite video game

===Game Development===
The Flood were added later in the game development stage of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', after the game had made its jump from the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform and Bungie was bought by [[Microsoft]]. At one point, the ringworld ''Halo'' featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but due to gameplay constraints, these were dropped. An additional consideration was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |title=One Million Years B.X. |author=Bungie|date=2006-02-10 |work=bungie.net|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |archivedate=2006-02-10 }}</ref>

==Flood forms==
===Infection forms=== 
[[Image:Flood3.jpg|thumb|150px|Infection form]]
The first Flood form encountered by the player during ''Halo'', infection forms are small creatures which use tentacles for mobility and infection, and are the base forms of Flood. They appear to have their own defined biological framework, as in the games they are seen without a host and do not appear to need one to survive. Individually they are weak and fragile; in the game they usually appear in large swarms. The infection forms will seek out any sentient life of sufficient [[Biomass (ecology)|bio-mass]] and [[calcium]] deposits to sustain itself, and proceed to attempt to use the creature as a host, by burrowing into the thoracic cavity, tapping into the spinal/nervous system, suppressing the host's consciousness, and releasing spores which cause the host to mutate. [[343 Guilty Spark]] mentions these "spores" during ''Halo: Combat Evolved''.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark:''' You can see how the body's been transformed by the genetic restructuring of the Flood infection. The small creatures carry spores that cause a host to mutate. The mutated host then produces spores that can pass the Flood to others. - {{cite video game

}}</ref> The host then begins to mutate into other forms.

In the ''Halo'' fiction, infection forms are seen to be unable to breach energy shields- those of the Master Chief's [[MJOLNIR]] armor, for instance, or the shields of [[Covenant Elite]]s. However non-shielded enemies and allies are extremely vulnerable to attack; a regular Marine or Grunt's personnel armor can be pierced by the Infection form's tentacles.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=282}}</ref>

===Combat forms===
<!-- [[Image:Flood Human.jpg|thumb|150px|Human Combat form]] -->
If the host is strong or deemed "useful" by the parasitic infection form, it will be converted into a warrior or worker form, used in both defensive and offensive situations. In the game, the combat forms were mainly infected Marines and Covenant Elites. As the Flood are seen to utilize the memories and knowledge of their hosts,<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammack|first= Lee|title=''[[Halo graphic novel#The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor]]''|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=United States |isbn=0785123725|pages=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=192}}</ref> they can repair or utilize weapons or machinery their hosts could use. These warrior or combat forms are extremely strong and agile, and are seen to be able to jump to extreme distances and heights, and attack enemies with whip-like tentacles. While damage to the host's head and limbs does not give the Combat form pause, eliminating the infection form embedded within the host's chest will disable the combat form. Combat forms ignore any threat to themselves and those fighting alongside them and will often kill themselves to kill an opponent.<ref name=h296>{{cite book |author= Piggyback||title=''Halo 2: The Official Strategy Guide: Combat Forms''|year= 2004|publisher= Piggyback Interactive Ltd.|location=United States |isbn=0-7615-4473-9|pages=96}}</ref>

===Carrier forms===
[[Image:Carrier Flood.jpg|thumb|150px|Carrier Form]]
The third stage of the Flood cycle. Carriers grow large sacs which contain several infection forms. When a carrier is in close proximity to any number of suitable hosts or is sufficiently damaged, it triggers a biochemical reaction which causes the sacs to explode and release the infection forms in order to infect more hosts. Carrier forms cannot physically attack; however, the explosion of a carrier form is roughly equivalent to a grenade detonation, killing any Flood or Covenant within the blast radius.<ref name=h276>{{cite book |author= Piggyback||title=''Halo 2: The Official Strategy Guide: Carrier Forms''|year= 2004|publisher= Piggyback Interactive Ltd.|location=United States |isbn=0-7615-4473-9|pages=76}}</ref> Loose [[grenades]] are also set off by a carrier form's explosion. If carrier forms are hurled into the air by another's explosion, they will explode upon landing. They are thought also to be made after a combat form serves its purpose. The combat form will then convert itself into a carrier form.<ref name=h276 />

===Brain forms===
[[Image:Brainform Flood.jpg|thumb|150px|Captain Keyes, mutated into a Brain Form]]
Brain forms are large, spongy creatures resembling a large bag of flesh with tentacles. They are seen used in ''Halo: The Flood'' to collect important data, such as codes, planet locations, and information about the species that the Flood can infect. In ''Halo'', [[Captain Jacob Keyes]] was subjected to an 'interrogation' of sorts by one of these forms before finally being completely assimilated. The Brain Form was then later damaged by the Master Chief during the level "Keyes".<ref>'''Cortana:''' No human life signs detected. The Captain... he's one of ''them!'' - {{cite video game

| developer = Bungie Studios
| publisher = Microsoft
| date = 2001

| level = Keyes

}}</ref>

Over time, the Brain Form strips memories and information from its victims. It appears that the Brain Form has some sort of intelligence, as it was able to use Keyes' own memories against him, in an effort to learn more about Earth.<ref name=tf200/> However, Keyes is able to resist giving the Flood information regarding the location of Earth when he realizes that the Flood cannot strip away information that he could draw from his neural implants, such as his name, rank, serial number, and the name of the ship that he commanded. Thus by "feeding" the Flood that information, he could continue to access it and withhold everything else.<ref name=tf200>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=200}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=225}}</ref>

===Command forms===
The command forms, due to their limited exposure in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' trilogy, are not well understood. Their purpose is not exactly known. [[Gravemind]] from ''Halo 2'' is a command form over either all Flood or those on Installation 05 ([[Delta Halo]]). When the Flood invaded a Covenant supply ship in the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' story ''The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'' they used corpses and dead biomatter to feed what appeared to be a much smaller, developing command form, which the Prophet Legate assumed to be a sort of central brain controlling the infestation.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammack|first= Lee|title=[[Halo Graphic Novel#The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor]]|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=United States |isbn=0785123725|pages=10}}</ref>

==Flood details==
It appears that the Flood can infect recently dead lifeforms, as the [[Hierarchs (Halo)#High Prophet of Regret|Prophet of Regret]] is assimilated by [[Gravemind]] shortly after being assassinated by the Master Chief in ''[[Halo 2]]''. However, one of the Marines in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' evades the Flood by "playing dead".<ref>'''Marine:''' Play dead! That's what I did... played dead. They took the live ones... - {{cite video game

Avery Johnson is a prime example of this, due to having a condition known as "Boren's Syndrome," a condition that "scrambles" his nervous system and makes it impossible for the Flood to take over his body. Once the initial infection has already occurred and been completed, a new Infection form can quickly take control of a Combat form, even if the previous infection form has been incapacitated.<ref name=h296/> The Flood have also been noted to gather corpses for use in the construction of new Flood forms,<ref>'''Cortana:''' Look, in the corners...

Most Flood on [[Alpha Halo|Installation 04]] were destroyed due to detonation of the ''[[Pillar of Autumn]]'''s engines in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', but in ''Halo 2'' the Flood on [[Delta Halo|Installation 05]] were similarly released. In ''Halo 2'', the Flood on [[Delta Halo]] are led by the command form [[Gravemind#The Gravemind|Gravemind]], a massive creature that dwells beneath Delta Halo's Library and takes over [[High Charity]]. In ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', Flood are trying to escape Halo, but are currently being destroyed by Covenant forces aware of the danger they present if they were to escape.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]|year= 2006|publisher= Tom Doherty Associates|location=New York |isbn=0-765-31568-8 |pages=32}}</ref>
