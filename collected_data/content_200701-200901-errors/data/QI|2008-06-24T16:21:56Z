'''''QI''''', standing for ''Quite Interesting'', is a [[United Kingdom|British]] comedy [[panel game]] television [[quiz show]] created and produced by [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]], hosted by [[Stephen Fry]], and featuring permanent panellist [[Alan Davies]]. Syndicated episodes of previous series are shown on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]]. ''QI'' has the highest viewing figures for any show on BBC Four and Dave.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/tv/audience.php ''QI''.com] Audience figures. Accessed [[21 June]], [[2007]].</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Armstrong|first=Stephen|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/dec/17/digitaltvradio|title=Have you got your daily male?|publisher=The Guardian|language=English|accessdate=2007-12-17|date=2007-12-17}}</ref>

It is distinguished by the awarding of points not necessarily for ''correct'' answers, but rather, for (quite) ''interesting'' ones. Many of the questions are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. Points are deducted from a panellist who gives an ''obvious but wrong'' answer, typically one that is generally accepted as true but is, in fact, false.

== Format and conception ==
The panel consists of four panellists: three rotating and one regular, Alan Davies, who has the seat to Stephen Fry's right. Davies has appeared in every episode, except for one that was themed on "Divination": he was present at the beginning, but "teleported" away during the buzzer demonstration. He was at a football match instead but was still able to play as communicated "from beyond."<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (D series)|Divination]] | series = QI | airdate = 2006-11-24 | season = D | number = 10 }}</ref> He has only won six times: since he generally offers up most of the "obvious but wrong" answers, he usually finishes last. The show's other panellists mainly come from a [[stand-up comedy]] background, although there have also been guests from other fields, including [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Gyles Brandreth]] and [[Roger McGough]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Series A, Episode 11]] | series = QI | airdate = 2003-11-20 | season = A | number = 11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Series B, Episode 4]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-10-29 | season = B | number = 4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (D series)|Series D, Episode 11]] | series = QI | airdate = 2006-12-01 | season = D | number = 11 }}</ref>

Questions are sometimes misleading or very difficult. Providing an "obvious but wrong" answer results in a sequence of [[klaxon]]s. In the first and second series, Fry produced the answer on a card to show the panellists, while it also flashed on the large screens behind them (except in the pilot episode and the first show of the first series, when only the cards were used).<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Series A, Episode 1]] | series = QI | airdate = 2003-09-11 | season = A | number = 1 }}</ref> In the third series and onward, Fry's answer cards were dispensed with altogether, leaving only the screens as proof that the answers given had been predicted.

[[Image:Stephen Fry QI Season 1 .png|thumb|Stephen Fry hosting ''QI'' in Series A.]]  

Because of the show's expectation that hardly anyone would be able to give a correct answer without significant prompting, it instead encourages sheer interestingness, which is how points are mainly scored.<ref name="Factoid">''QI Series 1 DVD'' Factoids</ref> As such, tangential discussions are encouraged, for panellists are apt to branch off into frivolous conversations, give voice to train of thought, and share humorous anecdotes from their own lives.<ref name="Factoid"/> The number of points given and taken away are normally decided by Fry or beforehand by the researchers, especially if the points given or taken are very large. For example, one episode asked, "What is the main ingredient of air?" If someone answered, "[[Carbon dioxide]]" then 3,000 points would have been deducted, but no-one gave this answer. However, Davies was deducted 10 points for saying, "[[Oxygen]]".<ref name="SAE4">{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Series A, Episode 4]] | series = QI | airdate = 2003-10-02 | season = A | number = 4}}</ref> Fry once said:

<blockquote>"Now, the rules are simple. Scoring is ''my'' business. Points are given and points are taken away. They are taken away for answers which are both obvious and wrong, and they're given not so much for being correct, as for being interesting. Their level of interestingness is impartially determined by a demographically selected customer-service focus consultancy, broken down by age and sex - i.e. me. Because there is no-one more broken down by age and sex."<ref name="SAE10">{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Series A, Episode 10]] | series = QI | airdate = 2003-11-13 | season = A | number = 10}}</ref></blockquote>

John Lloyd, ''QI's'' creator, has admitted that not even he has any idea on how the scoring system works, but there is someone who is paid to check on the scores. Guests are allowed the right of appeal if they believe their score is wrong, but no-one has done this so far.<ref name="Factoid"/>

=== Buzzers ===
Each of the panel has a [[buzzer]], the sounds of all four often being based along some sort of theme. They are demonstrated at the beginning of the programme, but are sometimes changed in some way for repeated use. Davies's buzzer usually contradicts those of the other panellists in some amusing way, and has been the last to be demonstrated in every episode except for the unbroadcast pilot, in which he went first and [[Eddie Izzard]], with a sillier buzzer, went last.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Pilot]] | series = QI }}</ref> In one instance in Series A, rather than a comical buzzer, Davies set off the forfeit alarm, meaning he started the show on -10 points before a question was asked.

=== General Ignorance ===
{{seealso|The Book of General Ignorance}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:QIfront.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Stephen Fry presenting an episode of ''QI''.<br />{{deletable image-caption}}]] -->
In a parody of ubiquitous [[general knowledge]] quizzes, the final round is off-topic and called "General Ignorance", focusing upon seemingly easy questions which have ''obvious but wrong'' answers. Whereas in the main rounds of the show, the panellists' use of buzzers is not usually enforced, the "General Ignorance" questions are introduced by Fry's reminder to keep "fingers on buzzers".

Due to the large number of "obvious but wrong" answers, panellists usually incur the greatest point losses in this round. In the second series' Christmas episode, Davies stated his refusal to participate in General Ignorance, saying that he "will not ''be'' humiliated at Christmas". In response, Fry offered to switch places with him, to the delight of the audience. Despite the seeming spontaneity of the swap, it was undoubtedly planned (at least on the part of Davies and the producers), as evidenced by the fact that Davies, in turn, produced his own set of questions on loose-leaf paper (most of which he directed at Fry), and also by the photographs and obvious-answer graphics which accompanied Davies's questions.  At the end of the show, Fry announced that the game's loser was, in fact, Fry himself, as a result of his falling into many of Davies's traps.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|B Christmas Special]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-12-26 | season = B | number = 12 }}</ref>

=== Extra tasks ===
In some episodes, panellists are given an extra task to complete during the course of the game. Those who do the best are often awarded extra points. Past tasks have included drawing contests (in which [[John Sessions]] has shown a particular talent);<ref name="S2E10">{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Series B, Episode 10]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-12-10 | season = B | number = 10 }}</ref> or looking for a specific hidden thing over the course of the show, such as a [[squirrel]] or a [[cuttlefish]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (C series)|Series C, Episode 11]] | series = QI | airdate = 2005-12-09 | season = C | number = 11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (C series)|Series C, Episode 9]] | series = QI | airdate = 2005-11-25 | season = C | number = 9 }}</ref> Panellists were also once given a card covered with magnetic letters with which to create words over the course of one show. [[Jimmy Carr]] successfully used all of his letters to create, "Put Smarties tubes on cats legs, make them walk like a robot."<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Series 2, Episode 5]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-10-05 | season = B | number = 5 }}</ref> In the fifth series, all the episodes have the same extra task — "The Elephant in the Room". In each episode, at least one of the answers is related to [[elephant]]s, the panellists being required to wave an elephant on a stick when they believe it is the appropriate moment.

==Production==
[[Image:QI Davies.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Alan Davies on ''QI''.]]
Writer and former [[BBC]] producer [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] devised the format of the show, and it is produced by [[Quite Interesting Limited]], an organisation set up by Lloyd. ''QI'' was originally seen as being an "Annotated [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]… the world's first non-boring encyclopædia."<ref name="Factoid"/> As a panel game, it was conceived as a radio show, with Lloyd as chairman. When it was decided that the show would air on television, [[Michael Palin]] was offered the job of chairman with Fry and Davies as captains of "clever" and "stupid" teams respectively. However, when Palin decided not to take the job, Fry stepped in, making Davies the only regular panellist, thus changing the entire format of the show.<ref>[http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/21/4850/last_among_eqials Chortle.co.uk "Last among eQIals"] Written [[21 December]], [[2006]]. Accessed [[21 June]], [[2007]].</ref>

Unlike many similar comedy-quiz programmes, the makers of the show insist that the answers are not given to the panellists beforehand.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/tv/ ''QI''.com] ''QI'': The BBC Television Series. Accessed [[27 July]], [[2007]].</ref> The panel are given a list of questions set to be asked just about an hour before the show, for preparatory purposes, but the guests are forbidden to ask for preparatory materials or other help.<ref name="Factoid"/> They do however run through a series of "warm up" questions before recording begins, but this is the only assistance the panellists receive. It is known that Davies never does any preparation at all.<ref name="Factoid"/> The show uses a warm-up comedian before recording begins, credited as the ''Audience Wrangler''. In the forthcoming series, [[Stephen Grant (comedian)|Stephen Grant]] provided the warm-up for ten of the twelve episodes, and [[Gordon Southern]] did so for the other two.<ref>[http://www.stephengrant.com/sg_television.htm#warmup Stephen Grant.com, Warm Up] Accessed [[23 June]], [[2007]].</ref> 

===Research===
The research for the show is mostly carried out by seven people called the ''QI'' Elves, a team which currently includes [[Justin Pollard]] and [[Vitali Vitaliev]]<ref name="Elfs">[http://www.qi.com/about/people.php#elves www.qi.com] The QI Elves, accessed [[24 September]] [[2007]]</ref> and previously included Molly Oldfield, daughter of the musician [[Mike Oldfield]]. The "elves" devise the questions, and are able to contact Stephen during the show to provide and correct information.<ref name="Elves">[http://www.qi.com/about/people.php#elves ''QI''.com] The ''QI'' Elves, accessed [[17 January]] [[2007]]</ref> Other people involved in researching questions and compiling the scripts are [[John Mitchinson]] and Piers Fletcher, known (along with Justin Pollard) as the ''Question Wranglers'',<ref name="Elves"/> whose research includes both Encyclopædia Britannica and [[Wikipedia]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Whittell|first=Giles|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article2765200.ece|title=Thinking buddies|publisher=The Times|date=2007-11-03|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> The ''QI'' website also has a large forum that currently has over 3,000  members.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/talk/ QI.com, Talk forum] Accessed [[15 June]], [[2007]].</ref> The forum contains several sections including the "Quite Interestrings", for general topics, the "Series Talk" section which are dedicated to different series, indicated by a letter of the alphabet, and "The Forum of General Ignorance", dedicated to things that are often misunderstood by most people. Some of the material written in the forums is used in the TV series.

===Theme tune===
The theme tune was composed by [[Howard Goodall]], who has twice appeared as a panellist on the show. The theme music was originally going to be the song "[[Wonderful World (song)|Wonderful World]]", sung by [[Herman's Hermits]], which was used in the unbroadcast pilot. However, the producers were forbidden the use of the song, and the DVD recording of the pilot now uses the theme music composed by Goodall.<ref name="Factoid"/>

===QI HQ===
The [[headquarters]] of ''QI'' is the '''QI Club''', situated at 16 Turl Street, [[Oxford]], on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street. It is a four-storey Georgian building, erected in [[1785]] by one Mr Priddy to provide accommodation for the scholars of [[Exeter College]].<ref>[http://www.qi.com/building/history.php QI.com, "History of the QI Building"] Accessed [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref> In [[1820]], it became a [[coffee house]], and between [[1945]]–[[1998]] was the popular Taj Mahal Indian Restaurant (with several other businesses running on different floors, together with 'Staircase 15' of Exeter). When ''QI'' took over, they bought the entire building, uniting all floors and restoring its Georgian appearance. The building itself consists of a [http://www.qi.com/building/bookshop/ bookshop], a [http://www.qi.com/building/cafe-bar/ café-bar] and a [http://www.qi.com/building/vodka-bar.php vodka bar], as well as a number of rooms devoted to use by the [http://www.qi.com/building/club/ private members club].<ref>[http://www.qi.com/building/ The ''QI'' Building]. Accessed February 5, 2008</ref> The bookshop arranges the books in whimsical, loosely defined categories that mingle fiction and non-fiction, thus meaning people come across books at random, making it more interesting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qi.com/building/bookshop/|title=The QI Bookshop|accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The bookshop staff have also been known to respond to stock suggestions made on the ''QI'' forums.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/talk/ QI Talk Forums]. Accessed February 5, 2008</ref>

==Episodes==
{{seealso|List of QI episodes}}

In ''QI'', every series is themed around a different letter of the alphabet, starting with the letter "A". Series are therefore referred to by letter rather than number. The first series started on [[11 September]], [[2003]], and consisted of topics beginning with A, including a round on people called "Alan".<ref name="SAE10"/> The second series consisted of topics beginning with "B", except in two episodes, one about "Music" and one about "Colour" (both of which can be considered "Blues" episodes).<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Music]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-12-17 | season = B | number = 11}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Colour]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-10-08 | season = B | number = 1}}</ref> Series D differed from the previous three as all episodes focused upon a single "D" topic.  Series E and F also deal with single topics. A [[video podcast]] was also planned, but this was instead turned into a set of "Quickies" featured on the BBC homepage for ''QI'', although are still referred to as "vodcasts" by the panellists introducing them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/qi/|title=Comedy - QI|publisher=BBC|language=English|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref> Two episodes have the distinction of being won by the audience: "Death", a special Halloween episode in series D and "England" in series E.

==Corrections, mistakes and retractions==
<!-- PLEASE ONLY INCLUDE CORRECTIONS THAT QI HAVE ADMITTED. MUST INCLUDE REFERENCES. -->
Although most of the answers presented on the show are correct, some have been disputed and shown to be incorrect. For example, in Series A, the show claimed that the longest animal in the world was the [[lion's mane jellyfish]],<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Series A, Episode 3]] | series = QI | airdate = 2003-09-25 | season = A | number = 3 }}</ref> but this was later corrected in Series C, saying that the longest animal in the world is the [[Lineus longissimus|bootlace worm]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (C series)|Series C, Episode 10]] | series = QI | airdate = 2005-12-02 | season = C | number = 10 }}</ref>

Members of the public and members of the ''QI'' website contact the show to correct information. The error that has attracted the most complaints to date was made in Series B, when it was claimed that the [[Welsh language]] has no word for "[[Blue]]". In fact, there is a word: "[[Wiktionary:glas|Glas]]".<ref>''QI Series 2 DVD'' Banter, with [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]], [[John Mitchinson]] and Piers Fletcher.</ref> In one case, a letter was read out when another episode in Series B claimed that language spoken by children's TV characters [[Flower Pot Men|Bill and Ben]] was called "Flobbadob" and was named after the sound made by creator [[Hilda Brabban|Hilda Brabban's]] younger brothers having [[flatulence|flatulent moments]] while in the bath.<ref name="S2E10"/> However, in Series D, Fry read out a letter written by [[Silas Hawkins]], the son of [[Peter Hawkins]], who provided the original voices of the characters. The letter read:

<blockquote>"The fart-in-the-bath story was trotted out last year in an episode of Stephen Fry's otherwise admirable quiz show ''QI''. It (the story) first appeared some twenty years ago in a newspaper article, to which my father immediately wrote a rebuttal. It was obviously ferreted out by some BBC researcher for ''QI''. It may be quite interesting, but in this case, it simply isn't true."<ref name="SDE8">{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (D series)|Descendants]] | series = QI | airdate = 2006-11-10 | season = D | number = 8 }}</ref></blockquote>

Fry then apologised and corrected the fact, saying, "Their language is called 'Oddle poddle'. 'Flobbadob' means 'Flowerpot' in Oddle poddle. I cannot believe I just said that", at which point he started laughing in disbelief.<ref name="SDE8"/>

At the end of the third series, [[Dara Ó Briain]] was deducted points for having stated, in the series before, that the [[triple point]] of water is zero degrees [[Celsius]], an answer which earned him 2 points at the time.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Series B, Episode 7]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-11-19 | season = B | number = 7 }}</ref> Viewers however, wrote in to say that the triple point of water is in fact ''0.01'' degrees, and so the 2 points awarded Dara in the previous series were revoked and he received a further deduction of 10 points for saying a now ''obvious answer''. Dara humorously retorted with, "How many people sat at home watching that and said, 'It's just a comedy show, but I'm not letting that [[feck]]er get away with that!?'"<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (C series)|Series C, Episode 12]] | series = QI | airdate = 2005-12-16 | season = C | number = 12}}</ref>

==Culture==
''QI'' has stated it follows its own [[philosophy]], which is that everything in the world, even that which appears to be most boring, is quite interesting if looked at in the right way. The website states that:

<blockquote>
"We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet almost none of the information we think we possess is true. [[Eskimo]]s do not rub noses. The [[rickshaw]] was invented by an American. [[Joan of Arc]] was not French. [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither [[haggis]], [[whisky]], [[porridge]], [[tartan|clan tartans]] nor [[kilt]]s are [[Scotland|Scottish]]. So we stand, silent, on a peak in [[Darién Province|Darien]]: a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. ''QI'' country. Whatever is interesting we are interested in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at ''in the right way''. At one extreme, ''QI'' is serious, intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, silly and frothy enough to please the most indolent couch-potato."<ref>[http://www.qi.com/about/philosophy.php ''QI''.com, Philosophy.] Accessed [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref>
</blockquote>

== Reception ==
''QI'' has been received positively by viewers. It is the most popular programme of any kind on [[BBC Four]],<ref>[http://www.qi.com/tv/audience.php QI.com Audience figures.] Accessed [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref>  and one of its books, ''[[The Book of General Ignorance]]'', reached Number 1 on [[amazon.co.uk|amazon.co.uk's]] best-seller list.

''QI'' has been supported by nearly all critics. Peter Chapman said, "When the schedules seem so dumbed-down, it's a delight to encounter the brainy and articulate Stephen Fry.  He excels in this format, being both scathing and generous."<ref>{{cite web | last = Chapman | first = Peter | title = ''QI'': Quite Interesting | publisher = ''QI'' News, originally ''[[The Independent]]'' | url = http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=119 | date = 2005-11-18 | accessdate = 2007-08-03}}</ref>

Another critic, Laura Barton said, "''QI'' and its canny coupling of Stephen Fry and Alan Davies, which manages to condense tweedy goodness, cockney charm, pub trivia and class war into one half-hour."<ref>{{cite web | last = Barton | first = Laura | title = ''QI'': The last bastion of good television | publisher = ''QI'' News, originally ''[[The Guardian]]'' | url = http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=97 | date = 2006-04-26 | accessdate = 2007-08-03}}</ref> An [[United States|American]] critic, Liesl Schillinger described ''QI'' as, "''[[Jeopardy]]'' with [[Stephen Colbert]] as host, with [[Steve Martin]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as guests, working off a game board loaded with unanswerable questions."<ref>{{cite web|last=Schillinger|first=Liesl|url=http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=489|title=QI gets The New York Times treatment|publisher=''QI News'', originally ''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2007-09-02|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref>

Critics have questioned the way the show is edited. One critic said, "At one point in tonight's show, Fry (normally urbanity itself) yells an obscenity at [[Rich Hall]], the result of, I guess, a long interchange between the two but, as most of it appears to have been cut out, the outburst comes out of the blue, making Fry look as if he's flipped his lid."<ref>{{cite web | title = ''QI'' in full swing | publisher = ''QI'' News, originally ''[[Hull Daily Mail|The Hull Daily Mail]]'' | url = http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=149 | date = 2003-12-30 | accessdate = 2007-08-03}}</ref>

====US====
[[Image:The Book of General Ignorance (US Cover).jpg|175px|thumb|right|The American cover for ''The Book of General Ignorance]]
On [[7 August]] [[2007]], ''The Book of General Ignorance'' was published in America by [[Harmony Books]].

====Complete series releases====
[[Image:QI Complete Series 1 DVD.jpg|140px|thumb|right|The Complete Series "A" DVD]]
‎A DVD release for the first series was the direct result of an internet petition signed by 1,821 people, which persuaded the BBC of the interest in such a move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/10/19/4578/pester_power|title=Pester power: QI fans force DVD release|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|language=English|date=2006-10-19|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref> Series "A", was therefore released by the [[BBC]]'s DVD division, [[2 entertain]] on [[6 November]] [[2006]]. It contains a number of outtakes as well as the unbroadcast pilot, which features the only appearances to date of [[Eddie Izzard]] and [[Kit Hesketh-Harvey]] as panellists. Sales over the Christmas period, however (in stark contrast to ''The Book of General Ignorance'', which topped the Amazon.co.uk best-seller list), were not as strong as hoped.<ref>[http://qitalk.blogspot.com/2007/01/everything-qi-quite-interesting.html Everything QI: Quite Interesting, the QI Blog. January 31, 2007]. Accessed 5 February, 2008</ref> A lack of adequate advertising is thought to be to blame (and subsequent episodes of ''QI'' have since trailed the DVD), and may have factored into to the label change for Series "B".<ref>[http://qitalk.blogspot.com/2007/01/everything-qi-quite-interesting.html Everything QI: Quite Interesting, the QI Blog.

The second and third series' ("B" and "C") have been announced for release in 2008, on the [[Warner Music]] label, rather than 2|entertain. Series "B" was released on [[17 March]] [[2008]].<ref>[http://qitalk.blogspot.com/2007/07/qi-series-b-on-dvd.html QI Talk Blog - QI Series B on DVD] Created [[4 July]], [[2007]].

===Other media===
A ''QI'' feature has appeared in [[BBC MindGames Magazine|''BBC MindGames'']] magazine since its fifth issue, and revolves around facts and questions in the ''General Ignorance''-mould. On [[10 February]] [[2007]], a weekly ''QI'' column began in ''[[The Telegraph]]'' newspaper. 52 columns were planned, but this has since expanded.

''QI'' also has an [http://www.qi.com/ official website], QI.com, which features facts, forums and other information. It also links to ''QI'''s internet show ''[[QI News]]'', a parody news show which broadcasts "News" items about things which are "quite interesting". ''QI News'' stars [[Glenn Wrage]] and [[Katherine Jakeways]] as the newsreaders, Bob Squire and Sophie Langton.
