The '''Jordan River''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: נהר הירדן ''nehar hayarden'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: نهر الأردن ''nahr al-urdun'') is a [[river]] in [[Southwest Asia]] flowing through the [[Great Rift Valley]] into the [[Dead Sea]]. Historically and religiously, it is considered to be one of the world's most sacred rivers,<ref name="11Sep2006">{{cite web | title=Raw Sewage Taints Sacred Jordan River| url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060911_ap_Jordan_Baptism.html| accessdate=2007-04-10 |author=Ramit Plushnick-Masti|publisher=Associated Press}}</ref> although the meaning and context of the word "sacred" may be ambiguous.

It is 251 [[kilometer]]s (156 [[mile]]s) long. Its [[Tributary|tributaries]] are 
#The [[Hasbani River|Hasbani]] (Hebrew: שניר ''senir'', Arabic: الحاصباني ''hasbani''), which flows from [[Lebanon]].
#The [[Banias River|Banias]] (Hebrew: חרמון ''hermon'', Arabic: بانياس ''banias''), arising from a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] at [[Banias]] at the foot of [[Hermon|Mount Hermon]].
#The [[Dan River (Jordan)|Dan]] (Hebrew: דן ''dan'', Arabic: اللدان ''leddan''), whose source is also at the base of Mount Hermon.
#The [[Ayoun]] (Hebrew: עיון ''ayoun'', Arabic: عيون ''ayoun''), which flows from Lebanon.

The four merge to form the Jordan in northern [[Israel]], near [[kibbutz]] Sede Nehemya. The Jordan drops rapidly in a 75 kilometer run to swampy [[Lake Hula]], which is slightly below [[sea level]] in the Galilee sea. Exiting the lake, it drops much more in about 25 kilometers to the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The last section has less [[stream gradient|gradient]], and the river begins to [[meander]] before it enters the [[Dead Sea]], which is about 400 meters below sea level and has [[Endorheic|no outlet]]. Two major [[Tributary|tributaries]] enter from the east during this last phase: the [[Yarmouk River]] and [[Jabbok|Jabbok River]].

Its section north of the [[Sea of Galilee]] (Hebrew: כינרת ''kinneret'', Arabic: ''Bohayrat Tabaraya'', meaning Lake of [[Tiberias]]) is within the boundaries of [[Israel]] (disputed by Syria), and forms the western boundary of the [[Golan Heights]]. South of the lake, it forms the border between the [[Kingdom of Jordan]] (to the east) and the [[West Bank]] (to the west). 

In [[1964]] Israel began operating a [[dam]] that diverts water from the Sea of Galilee, a major Jordan River water provider, to the national water carrier, according to Hillel Glassmam, a stream expert at Israel's Parks Authority. Also in [[1964]] Jordan constructed a channel that diverted water from the [[Yarmouk River]], another main tributary of the Jordan River. This resulted in great damage to the ecosystem. Syria has also built reservoirs that catch the Yarmouk's waters. In a year, the Yarmouk's flow into the Jordan River will dwindle to a trickle, once Syria and Jordan begin operating a dam they jointly built, he added. Environmentalists blame [[Israel]], [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]]. The three countries replenished the river with sewage water, agricultural runoff and salt water, Glassman said. The freshwater foliage that once flourished along the river's banks has been replaced with saline vegetation.<ref name="11Sep2006" />

In modern times the waters are 70 to 90% used for human purposes and the flow is much reduced. Because of this and the high evaporation rate of the Dead Sea, the sea is shrinking. All the shallow waters of the southern end of the sea have been drained in modern times and are now salt flats. 

In [[September]] [[2006]] there arose a problem with contamination: just downstream, raw sewage is flowing into the water. Small sections of the Jordan's upper portion, near the [[Sea of Galilee]], have been kept pristine for baptisms. Most polluted is the 60-mile downstream stretch - a meandering stream from the Sea of Galilee to the [[Dead Sea]]. Environmentalists say the practice has almost destroyed the river's [[ecosystem]]. Rescuing the river could take decades, according to environmentalists.<ref name="11Sep2006" />

The waters of the Jordan are an extremely important resource to the dry lands of the area and are a [[Wiktionary:bone of contention|bone of contention]] between [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinians]]. 

[[Route 90 (Israel)|Route 90]] connects the northern and southern tips of Israel and parallels the Jordan River on the western side.

== In the Bible ==
In the [[Bible]], the Jordan is referred to as the source of fertility to a large plain ("Kikkar ha-Yarden"), called on account of its luxuriant vegetation "the garden of [[God]]" ([[Genesis]] 13:10). There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible; only scattered and indefinite references to it are given. [[Jacob]] crossed it and its tributary, the [[Jabbok]] (the modern Al-Zarḳa), in order to reach [[Haran]] (Gen. 32:11, 23-24). It is noted as the line of demarcation between the "two tribes and the half tribe" settled to the east ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 34:15) and the "nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh" that, led by [[Joshua]], settled to the west (Josh. 13:7, passim).

Opposite [[Jericho]] it was called "the Jordan of Jericho" (Num. 34: 15, 35: 1). The Jordan has a number of [[ford (crossing)|fords]], and one of them is famous as the place where many Ephraimites were slain by Jephthah ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 12:5-6). It seems that these are the same fords mentioned as being near Beth-barah, where Gideon lay in wait for the Midianites (Judges 7:24). In the plain of the Jordan, between Succoth and Zarthan, is the clay ground where Solomon had his brass-foundries ([[Books of Kings|I Kings]] 7:46).
In Biblical history the Jordan appears as the scene of several [[miracle]]s, the first taking place when the Jordan, near Jericho, was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua (Josh. iii. 15-17). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as "a witness" between them and the other tribes (Josh. xxii. 10, 26 et seq.). The Jordan was said to be crossed dry-shod by [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]] (II Kings 2: 8, 14). Elisha performed two other miracles at the Jordan: he healed Naaman by having him bathe in its waters, and he made the ax of one of the children of the prophets float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water (II Kings 5:14, 6:6).

The Jordan was crossed by [[Judas Maccabeus]] and his brother [[Jonathan Maccabaeus]] during their war with the Nabatæans ([[1 Maccabees]] 5:24). A little later the Jordan was the scene of the battle between Jonathan and [[Bacchides]], in which the latter was defeated (I Macc. 9:42-49). 

The [[New Testament]] states that [[John the Baptist]] baptized [[Jesus]] in the Jordan (Matt. 3:13).

==Symbolic importance==
The Jordan is a frequent symbol in [[Folk music|folk]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], and [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] [[music]], or in [[poetry|poetic]] or [[literature|literary]] works. 

Because the [[Israelite]]s made a difficult and hazardous journey from [[slavery]] in [[Egypt]] to freedom in ''The Promised Land'', the Jordan can refer to freedom. The actual crossing is the final step of the journey, which is then complete. The Jordan also can signify death itself, with the crossing from life into [[Paradise]] or [[Heaven]].
