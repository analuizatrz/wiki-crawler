'''Issy Smith''' (c. [[18 September]] 1886/1888/1890-[[11 September]] [[1940]]) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. Smith, the first living Jewish recipient of the Victoria Cross, was also awarded the French [[Croix de Guerre]] (with palm) and Russian [[Cross of St. George]] (4th class).<ref>Lieutenant [[Frank Alexander de Pass]] was awarded a posthumous VC in November 1914. A private in the [[First Australian Imperial Force]], [[Leonard Keysor]], was decorated for his actions in August 1915.</ref>  

Born Ishroulch Shmeilowitz (or alternative renderings), to parents residing in Egypt, Smith travelled to Britain as a child stowaway and first volunteered to serve in the British Army in 1904. He emigrated to Australia after discharge, where he remained until mobilised as a reservist in 1914. As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, Smith was engaged in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. On [[26 April]] [[1915]], Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers while exposed to sustained fire and attended to them "with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk." His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.

After his demobilisation, Smith returned to Australia with his wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in [[Melbourne]]'s Jewish community, was appointed a [[Justice of the Peace]], and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the [[United Australia Party]] in the [[Australian general election, 1931|1931 general election]].

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[Alexandria]], the son of French citizens Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz, who were of Polish origin.<ref name="ADB">[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110668b.htm Smith, Issy (1890 - 1940)], adb.online.anu.edu.au. Accessed [[27 July]] [[2007]].</ref> His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School and worked as a deliverer in the [[East End of London|East End]], then an impoverished "[[ghetto]]" where [[Yiddish]] was the predominant spoken language .<ref>Rubinstein (2002), ''The Jews in the Modern World: A History Since 1750'', p242</ref> Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the [[Aliens Act 1905|Aliens Act]] in 1905.<ref>Alderman, ''Modern British Jewry'', pp149-150</ref> 

He joined the British Army in 1904, becoming a private in the Manchester Regiment. The pseudonym Issy Smith was adopted in the process of enlisting at the behest of a recruiting sergeant. Smith completed his training, serving in [[South Africa]] and [[India]] with the 1st Battalion. He boxed competitively, winning the British Army's middleweight championship, and played football. While in India, Smith was present at the [[Delhi Durbar]] parade, in which the 1st Manchesters participated, and thus awarded the Delhi Durbar Medal.<ref name="ADB"/> 

Accepting his discharge in 1912, Smith emigrated to Australia after brief employment in London. He lived in the Melbourne suburb of [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|Ascot Vale]] while working for the city's gas company. Retained as a reservist, Smith was duly mobilised by the British Army after the commencement of hostilities in August 1914. Some sources state that Smith was present at the capture of [[German New Guinea]] by the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]].<ref name="DNW">[http://www.dnw.co.uk/dnw/medals/FMPro?-db=dnwmedals&-format=vcdetail.htm&-lay=master&-sortfield=vc%20recipient&GalleryFlag=VC&-max=50&-recid=12614929&-find= Dix Noonan Webb], dnw.co.uk.

==World War I==
[[Image:Victoria Cross Medal Ribbon & Bar.jpg|thumb|The Victoria Cross.]] 
The 1st Manchester Regiment, stationed in India, embarked for France in September 1914 as the constituent British battalion of the Jullundur Brigade, 3rd ([[Lahore]]) Indian Division. Actively engaged in the battles of [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]], the 1st Manchesters had incurred over 500 casualties by the beginning of [[Second Battle of Ypres|"Second Ypres"]] on [[22 April]] [[1915]]. [[Chemical warfare]] first emerged on the Western Front during the German offensive, and Smith himself would be temporarily incapacitated by gas. The 1st Manchesters were involved in an initially successful counter-attack conducted by the Jullundur and Ferozepore brigades on [[26 April]], near Wieltje.<ref name="Wyrall">Wyrall (2002), ''The History of the King's Regiment (Liverpool) 1914-19'', p122</ref> Rudimentary forms of protection against the [[chlorine gas]] proved ineffectual, limiting the advance and causing many soldiers to succumb to its effects.<ref>Mileham (2000), p92</ref><ref name="Wyrall"/> 

During the counter-attack, Smith, of his own volition, ventured towards a German position to attend to a severely wounded soldier. He carried him some 250 yards to relative safety while exposed to intense German fire. Such endeavour was repeated throughout the day under similarly perilous conditions "regardless of personal risk". Recounting his own rescue by Smith to a [[Daily Mail]] correspondent, Sergeant Rooke said of the corporal: "He behaved with wonderful coolness and presence of mind the whole time, and no man deserved a Victoria Cross more thoroughly than he did."<ref name="DNW"/>

Smith was hospitalised in Dublin, where he recuperated from his gassing. His Victoria Cross was later presented to him at [[Buckingham Palace]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].<ref>Jewish Chronicle, [[11 February]] [[1916]]</ref> Feted by publications such as the [[Jewish Chronicle]], Smith's status as a recipient of the VC was utilised by the British government for the purposes of stimulating further recruitment.<ref>Cesarani (1994), ''The Jewish Chronicle and Anglo-Jewry, 1841-1991'', p118</ref><ref name="DNW"/> His visits to Jewish communities in the United Kingdom generated much interest, attracting dignitaries and large crowds in the process.<ref name="DNW"/> In September, Smith was receieved at [[Mansion House, Dublin]] by the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]] [[Matthew Nathan]], who took advantage of the occassion to reaffirm loyalty to both Britain and Ireland.<ref>Keogh (1998), ''Jews in Twentieth Century Ireland: Refugees, Anti-semitism and the Holocaust'', p69</ref> Contemporaries, however, continued to report instances of discrimination against Jewish servicemen, including an incident involving Issy Smith in Leeds.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, [[22 October]] [[1915]], p5</ref> While documenting his recruitment drive, the Jewish Chronicle reported that the proprietor of the Grand Restaurant had refused to serve Smith during his tour of [[Yorkshire]] because he was Jewish, while indicating the staff were prepared to accept his non-Jewish acquaintince.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, p13</ref> Smith's tour continued without disruption, taking him to [[Edinburgh]], Scotland. 

On the Western Front, the demoralised and depleted Indian Corps fought its final battle at [[Battle of Loos|Loos]].<ref>Omissi, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/india_wwone_01.shtml India and the Western Front], bbc.co.uk. Accessed [[15 August]] [[2007]].</ref> With the exception of two cavalry divisions, the Indian Corps in Europe redeployed to the Middle East theatre in December 1915 to be integrated into the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. Smith returned to active duty as a sergeant, serving in [[Mesopotamian Campaign|Mesopotamia]] and [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine]] until the cessation of hostilities with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Germany on [[30 October]] and [[11 November]] respectively. He had been wounded five times.<ref name="ADB"/> 

==Legacy==
Demobilised after the war, Smith returned to London as a civilian. Like many former servicemen contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially - a predicament compounded by illness.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, [[20 January]] [[1922]], p9</ref> He pawned his medals as a consequence for Â£20, only for them to be recovered by the [[Jewish Historical Society]] on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi [[Joseph H. Hertz]] and ultimately reunited with Smith.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, [[28 November]] [[1924]]</ref><ref name="JC 95">Jewish Chronicle, [[6 October]] [[1995]], p6</ref> Smith's varied occupations in Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe.<ref>Grimsby Evening Telegraph</ref> He emigrated to Australia in 1925 with his wife Elsie (neÃ© McKechnie), whom he had married at [[Camberwell]] Registry Office. Marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice) and reputedly angered his parents despite the couple's later observance of Jewish religious tradition in a formal ceremony held at Central [[Synagogue]], Hallam Street.<ref name="ADB"/>

Smith's family settled in [[Moonee Ponds, Victoria|Moonee Ponds]], Melbourne, where his standing in the Jewish community became high.<ref name="ADB"/> He became the manager of [[British International Pictures]] in Melbourne, in 1928, worked for [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop Rubber Company]], and was finally employed by the Civil Aviation Board at [[Essendon Airport]]. Appointed a [[justice of the peace]] in 1930, Smith abortively entered politics in the 1931 Federal elections as a candidate for the [[United Australia Party]] contesting the seat of Melbourne in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

Smith died of [[coronary thrombosis]] in September 1940.<ref name="ADB"/> He was buried in the Jewish section of Fawkner Cemetery with full military honours. His Victoria Cross was sold by his family in 1990 and later auctioned as part of a collection of Smith's medals, selling for approximately 60,000 dollars (Â£30,000)<ref name="DNW"/><ref name="JC 95"/>
