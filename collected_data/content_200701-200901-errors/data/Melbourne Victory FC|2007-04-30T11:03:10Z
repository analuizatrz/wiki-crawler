'''Melbourne Victory FC''' is an [[Australia]]n professional [[football (soccer)]] club based in the city of [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The club competes in the [[A-League]], and are currently the only team from the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] playing in the competition.

Melbourne Victory is the [[A-League 2006-07|2006-07 A-League]] [[List of A-League champions|premiership]] and [[List of A-League champions|championship]] winner - the first and only club in the [[A-League]] to achieve the championship/premiership double[http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/amazing-archies-victory-march/2007/02/18/1171733611976.html]. As a result, the club will be one of two Australian representatives to the [[AFC Champions League 2008|2008]] [[AFC Champions League]].

==History==
Melbourne Victory were founded in [[2004]] after the announcement of a revamped domestic league in Australia.  The new [[A-League]] replaced the [[National Soccer League]], which was disbanded in 2004. Eight licenses were handed out by [[Football Federation Australia]]. 

FFA approved the Melbourne Victory consortium to be Melbourne's representative in the league, with [[Belgravia Leisure Pty Ltd]] backing the club. The Chairman and CEO of Belgravia Leisure, [[Geoff Lord]], was installed as the inaugural Chairman of Melbourne Victory F.C. 

[[Gary Cole (footballer)|Gary Cole]] (an ex-[[Australia national football (soccer) team|Socceroo]]) was hired to become Football Operations manager, and was soon joined by [[Ernie Merrick]], hired as head coach from the [[Victorian Institute of Sport]] (VIS). [[Archie Thompson]], a Socceroo who had been playing in Europe with [[Lierse S.K.]], was Melbourne Victory's first player signing. The club soon signed three more internationals for their squad - Socceroo [[Kevin Muscat]], Austrian [[Richard Kitzbichler]] and Belgian [[Geoffrey Claeys]].

The remainder of the squad was quickly assembled, although room was left for signings before Melbourne played its first competitive match against [[Adelaide United]] in a [[World Club Championship]] qualifier.

On [[October 27]] [[2005]], [[South Korea]]n electronics giant [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] became the club's major sponsor in a two year deal, the second largest in Australian domestic football history.

Melbourne Victory were the first team to complete the [[A-League]] double in the history of the competition; clinching the premiership against the [[New Zealand Knights]] 4-0 at Olympic Park with 5 rounds of competition remaining, then beating [[Adelaide United]] 6-0 in the grand final at a sold out [[Telstra Dome]] to take the championship.

==Colours and badge==
Melbourne Victory FC's kit colours are navy blue, silver and white, which encompass the traditional state sporting colours of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In the first A-League season, only the club badge displayed a [[Chevron (insigne)|chevron]], known colloquially or to supporters as the "Big V", a symbol that has long been an identifier of Victorian sporting teams. However, to make a change from traditional A-League away strips, which are generally white with some of the club's home colors on the sleves and shorts, in the 2006-07 season the away strip was changed to grey shorts, grey socks and a grey jersey with a white chevron on the front. This was an immediate hit with the club's supporters and fans, and so from the 2007-08 season onwards, the Victory home jersey will sport a white chevron on the front.

==Stadium==
[[Image:Aleaguefinal3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|2006-07 A-League Grand Final at Telstra Dome]]
{{see|Telstra Dome|Olympic Park Stadium|Melbourne Rectangular Stadium}}

Melbourne Victory were originally based at the aging [[Olympic Park, Melbourne|Olympic Park]] stadium, where they played all home matches during the [[A-League 2005-06|2005-06 A-League season]].  This stadium has seated areas only on the wings, with standing-room sandy terraces on the north and south ends.

On the back of a then-record regular season attendance of 39,730 at the all-seater [[Telstra Dome]] for the match against [[Sydney FC]] on [[September 2]] [[2006]], it was announced that seven home matches would be moved to "the Dome". Only one match (due to a Robbie Williams concert)- against the struggling [[New Zealand Knights]] - would remain at Olympic Park.

This move to such a large stadium was viewed with skepticism by many, but proved to be an outstanding success, with the average attendance rising to over 27,000 during the season. 

Prior to the 06-07 season the club had planned to move to a new stadium being planned to the east of the current Olympic Park complex.  The new [[Melbourne Rectangular Stadium]] was originally expected to seat approximately 20,000 spectators (expandable to 25,000) and was to be completed in time for the start of the 2008-09 campaign. 

These plans have since been revised after the Victory refused to commit to playing at such a small capacity stadium.  Under the new plans, the stadium will have a capacity of 31,500, on the condition that the Victory sign on as a tenant.

The club has confirmed that Telstra Dome will host all home matches for the 2007-08 season.

==Supporters==
Melbourne Victory is the only A-League team based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and have a dedicated fan base - the club have consistently set records for A-League attendances. With the move to Telstra Dome during the 2006/07 season, large crowds have been a constant feature of Victory home games.  On [[February 18]], [[2007]], a capacity crowd of 55,436 attended the Grand Final against [[Adelaide United]] at the Telstra Dome.  This is the largest attendance on record for a domestic football match in Australia, surpassing the previous record of 50,333 set at the same venue earlier in the season.

Melbourne Victory has a number of supporter groups, each group with its own style of support. These groups include among many others, the ''BWB'' (Blue and White Brigade), ''M7C'' (May 7 Crew), and ''SDC'' (Southern Death Crew).  The British style of support generally stand at the North End of Telstra Dome, however it's referred to as the 'South End' because of the tradition started by the SDC and affiliates at the South-End terrace of Olympic Park. The South-End of Telstra Dome hosts the more European / South American style of support led by the ''BWB'', however they are branded the 'Northern Terrace' as a whole because of ties to the club's original stadium.

==Rivalries==
[[Image:Mvfc billboard.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A billboard made by the MVFC supporters before a derby with Adelaide.]]

[[Sydney FC]] are promoted as Melbourne Victory's main rivals, even as the most heated rivalry in the A-League.  Given the short history of the league, this is primarily due to other historical competitions and rivalries between the cities of [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]].

Melbourne and [[Adelaide United]] have also developed a significant rivalry in the 2006/2007 season. In fact, some have argued that the Melbourne-[[Adelaide]] (or [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]-[[South Australia]] State rivalry) is even greater than the Melbourne-Sydney rivalry.<ref>Baum, Greg: [http://www.theage.com.au/news/soccer/intense-state-rivalry-dates-back-to-colonial-past/2007/02/16/1171405443111.html "Intense state rivalry dates back to colonial past"], ''[[The Age]]'', [[17 February]] [[2007]], News 7</ref> Both sides' traveling fans turn out in good numbers when the two teams clash. An incident during the Round 8 clash of the [[A-League 2006-07|2006/07 season]] saw Melbourne captain [[Kevin Muscat]] knock then Adelaide United coach [[John Kosmina]] from his chair in the technical area, as he was retrieving the play ball that had rolled under Kosmina's chair.  The Adelaide coach jumped to his feet and grabbed Muscat by the throat as the two exchanged words on the sideline. Muscat was given a yellow card, while Kosmina was sent to the stand and later received a four-match ban from the technical area for his part in the altercation. The two sides went on to contest the [[A-League 2006-07| 2006/07]] Grand Final, with Melbourne romping home 6-0.
