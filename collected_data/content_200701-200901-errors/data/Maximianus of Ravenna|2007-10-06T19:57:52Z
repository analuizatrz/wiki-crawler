[[Maximianus of Ravenna]], [[bishop of Ravenna]] ([[499]] - [[February 22]], [[556]]; feast day formerly [[February 21]]).

Born in [[Pula|Pola]], Italy, Maximianus was consecrated bishop of Ravenna in [[546]] by [[Pope Vigilius]]. His flock refused his leadership for a long time because he was too humble. He completed the [[basilica of San Vitale]] in Ravenna, the dedication of which was attended by Emperor [[Justinian]] and his wife [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]]. He also built [[Sant'Apollinare in Classe]] and several other churches.
 
Maximianus devoted himself to the revision of liturgical books and to the emendation of the Latin text of the Bible, and commissioned a large number of illuminated manuscripts. For the high altar in Ravenna he had a hanging made of the most costly cloth, which was embroidered with a portrayal of the entire life of Jesus. In another hanging he had portraits of all his predecessors embroidered on gold ground.

Maximians most remarkable episcopal furnishing is the [[Throne of Maximianus]], the ''cathedra'' of the bishop which was constructed entirely of ivory panels. It was probably carved in [[Constantinople]] and shipped to Ravenna. It consists of decorative floral panels framing various figured panels, including one with the complex monogram of the bishop.

In a 6th century mosaic at Ravenna, Saint Maximianus (named above the figure) is in attendance upon Emperor Justinian. The saint holds a cross and wears a chasuble and stole.
