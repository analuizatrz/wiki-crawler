'''''Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka''''', [[Case citation|347 U.S. 483]] ([[1954]]),<ref>[http://laws.findlaw.com/us/347/483.html Full text of the decision courtesy of Findlaw.com]</ref> was a [[landmark decision]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], which overturned earlier rulings going back to ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' in [[1896]], by declaring that state laws which established separate [[public school]]s for black and white students denied black children equal educational opportunities. Handed down on [[May 17]], [[1954]], the [[Earl Warren|Warren]] Court's unanimous (9-0) decision stated that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." As a result, [[de jure]] [[racial segregation]] was ruled a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  This victory paved the way for [[integration]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]].   

==Background==
For much of the 90 years preceding the ''Brown'' case, race relations in the U.S. had been dominated by [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]]. This policy had been endorsed in 1896 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' which held that as long as the separate facilities for the separate races were "equal," the segregation did not violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] ("no state shall… deny to any person…the equal protection of the laws"). 

The [[plaintiffs]] in ''Brown'' asserted that this system of [[racial segregation in the United States|racial separation]], while masquerading as providing separate but relatively equal treatment of both white and black Americans, instead perpetuated inferior accommodations, services, and treatment for black Americans. Racial segregation in education varied widely from the 17 states which required racial segregation to the 16 which prohibited it. ''Brown'' was influenced by [[UNESCO]]'s 1950 Statement, signed by a wide variety of internationally-renowned scholars, titled ''[[The Race Question]]''.<ref name="Prins"> [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30431&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html “Toward a World without Evil: Alfred Métraux as UNESCO Anthropologist (1946-1962)”], by [[Harald E.L. Prins]], UNESCO {{en icon}} </ref> This declaration denounced previous [[scientific racism|attempts at scientifically justifying racism]] as well as morally condemning [[racism]]. Another work which the Supreme Court cited was [[Gunnar Myrdal]]'s ''[[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]'' (1944). Myrdal had been a signatory of the UNESCO declaration.

''Brown'' is undoubtedly the most famous of a series of U.S. Supreme Court cases that deal principally with the efforts of racial activists to promote the interests of the people they represented.

==Brown v. Board of Education==   
In [[1951]], a [[class action]] suit was filed against the Board of Education of the City of [[Topeka, Kansas]] in the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] for the District of [[Kansas]]. The plaintiffs were thirteen Topeka parents on behalf of their twenty children.<ref>Anderson, ''[http://cjonline.com/stories/050904/04b_localcase.shtml Legacy of Brown: Many people part of local case, Thirteen parents representing 20 children signed up as Topeka plaintiffs]'', The Topeka Capital-Journal (Sunday, May 9, 2004).</ref> 

The suit called for the school district to reverse its policy of racial segregation. Separate elementary schools were operated by the Topeka Board of Education under an 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for black and white students in twelve communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by the leadership of the Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman [[McKinley Burnett]]; [[Charles Scott]], one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd. 

The named plaintiff, [[Oliver Brown (civil rights)|Oliver L. Brown]] was a parent, a welder in the shops of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]], an assistant pastor at his local church, and an [[African American]].<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june04/brown_05-12.html Black, White, and Brown], <em>PBS NewsHour</em> ([[2004-05-12]]).</ref>  Brown had initially contacted Topeka attorney [[William Everett Glenn, Sr.]] about his concerns regarding "separate but equal" policies of Topeka schools. Attorney Glenn referred him to the local Topeka [[NAACP]] chapter. He was convinced to join the lawsuit by Scott, a childhood friend. Brown's daughter Linda, a third grader, had to walk six blocks to her school bus stop to ride to [[Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site|Monroe Elementary]], her segregated black school one mile away, while Sumner Elementary, a white school, was only seven blocks from her house.  

As directed by the NAACP leadership, the parents each attempted to enroll their children in the closest neighborhood school in the fall of 1951. They were each refused enrollment and directed to the segregated schools. Linda Brown Thompson later recalled the experience in a 2004 PBS documentary: 
:... well. like I say, we lived in an integrated neighborhood and I had all of these playmates of different nationalities. And so when I found out that day that I might be able to go to their school, I was just thrilled, you know. And I remember walking over to [[Sumner school]] with my dad that day and going up the steps of the school and the school looked so big to a smaller child. And I remember going inside and my dad spoke with someone and then he went into the inner office with the principal and they left me out...to sit outside with the secretary. And while he was in the inner office, I could hear voices and hear his voice raised, you know, as the conversation went on. And then he immediately came out of the office, took me by the hand and we walked home from the school. I just couldn't understand what was happening because I was so sure that I was going to go to school with Mona and Guinevere, Wanda, and all of my playmates.<ref>[http://brownvboard.org/video/blackwhitebrown/ ''Black/White & Brown''], transcript of program produced by KTWU Channel 11 in Topeka, Kansas. Originally aired May 3, 2004.</ref>

The Kansas case, "Oliver Brown et al v. The Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas," was named after Oliver Brown as a legal strategy to have a man at the head of the roster. Also, it was felt by lawyers with the National Chapter of the NAACP, that having Mr. Brown at the head of the roster would be better received by the U.S. Supreme Court Justices because Mr. Brown had an intact, complete family, as opposed to someone who was a single parent head of household. The thirteen plaintiffs were: Oliver Brown, Darlene Brown, Lena Carper, Sadie Emmanuel, Marguerite Emerson, Shirley Fleming, Zelma Henderson, Shirley Hodison, Maude Lawton, Alma Lewis, Iona Richardson, and Lucinda Todd.<ref>Brown Foundation for Educational Equity, Excellence and Research, [http://brownvboard.org/mythsandtruths/ ''Myths Versus Truths''] (revised April 11, 2004)</ref><ref>Ric Anderson, ''[http://cjonline.com/stories/050904/04b_localcase.shtml Legacy of Brown: Many people part of local case, Thirteen parents representing 20 children signed up as Topeka plaintiffs]'', The Topeka Capital-Journal (Sunday, May 9, 2004).</ref>

The District Court ruled in favor of the Board of Education, citing the U.S. Supreme Court precedent set in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', {{ussc|163|537|[[1896]]}}, which had upheld a state law requiring "separate but equal" segregated facilities for blacks and whites in railway cars.<ref>''[http://www.cjonline.com/stories/031604/loc_brown10.shtml School facilities for Negroes here held comparable]'', The Topeka State Journal (August 3, 1951)</ref>  The three-judge District Court found that segregation in public education has a detrimental effect upon negro children, but denied relief on the ground that the negro and white schools in Topeka were substantially equal with respect to buildings, transportation, curricular, and educational qualifications of teachers.<ref>''Brown v.

===Supreme Court review===
The case of ''Brown v. Board of Education'' as heard before the Supreme Court combined five cases: ''Brown'' itself, ''[[Briggs v. Elliott]]'' (filed in [[South Carolina]]), ''[[Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County]]'' (filed in [[Virginia]]), ''[[Gebhart v. Belton]]'' (filed in [[Delaware]]), and ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'' (filed in [[Washington D.C.]]). 

All were NAACP-sponsored cases. The ''Davis'' case, the only case of the five originating from a student protest, began when sixteen year old [[Barbara Rose Johns]] organized and led a 450 student walkout of [[Robert Russa Moton Museum|Moton High School]]. 

The Kansas case was unique among the group in that there was no contention of gross inferiority of the segregated schools' physical plant, curriculum, or staff.  The district court found substantial equality as to all such factors. The Delaware case was unique in that the District Court judge in ''Gebhart'' ordered that the black students be admitted to the white high school due to the substantial harm of segregation and the differences which made the schools separate but ''not'' equal. The NAACP's chief counsel, [[Thurgood Marshall]]&mdash;who was later appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in [[1967]]&mdash;argued the case before the Supreme Court for the plaintiffs. Assistant attorney general Paul Wilson &mdash;later distinguished emeritus professor of law at the [[University of Kansas]]&mdash;conducted the state's ambivalent defense in his first appellate trial.

===Local outcomes===
The Topeka middle schools had been integrated since 1941. Topeka High School was integrated from its inception in the late 1800s.  The Kansas law permitting segregated schools allowed them only "below the high school level."

Soon after the district court decision, election outcomes and the political climate in Topeka changed. The Board of Education of Topeka began to end segregation in the Topeka elementary schools in August of 1953, integrating two attendance districts. All the Topeka elementary schools were changed to neighborhood attendance centers in January of 1956, although existing students were allowed to continue attending their prior assigned schools at their option.<ref>[http://www.cjonline.com/stories/031604/loc_brown4.shtml ''Racial bar down for teachers here''], Topeka Daily Capital (January 19, 1956)</ref><ref>[http://www.cjonline.com/stories/031604/loc_brown16.shtml ''First step taken to end segregation''], Topeka Daily Capital (September 9, 1953)</ref><ref>[http://www.cjonline.com/stories/031604/loc_brown7.shtml ''Little Effect On Topeka'']
Topeka Capital-Journal (May 18, 1954)</ref>  Plaintiff Zelma Henderson, in a 2004 interview, recalled that no demonstrations or tumult accompanied desegregation in Topeka's schools:

:"They accepted it," she said. "It wasn't too long until they integrated the teachers and principals."<ref>Erin Adamson, ''[http://www.cjonline.com/stories/051103/our_brown1.shtml Breaking barriers: Topekans reflect on role in desegregating nation's schools]'', Topeka Capital Journal (May 11, 2003)</ref>

The Topeka Public Schools administration building is named in honor of McKinley Burnett, NAACP chapter president who organized the case.

[[Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site|Monroe Elementary]] was designated a U.S. [[National Historic Site]] unit of the National Park Service on [[October 26]], [[1992]].

==The decision==
The 1954 decision reversed the precedent set by the Court's previous decision in ''[[Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education]]'', ([[1899]])[[Case citation|*]], which had specifically validated the segregation of public schools. ''Brown'' did not, however, result in the immediate [[desegregation]] of America's public schools, nor did it mandate desegregation of public accommodations, such as restaurants or bathrooms, that were owned by private parties, which would not be accomplished until the passage of Title II of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. However, it was a giant step forward for the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]], placing the weight of the Federal Judiciary squarely behind the forces of desegregation.

''Brown'' is often referred to as ''Brown I'', because the following year, [[1955]], the Court completed its ruling. In this second ''Brown'' decision, ''Brown II'', the Warren Court ordered the states' compliance with ''Brown I'' "with all deliberate speed." ''Brown II'' was argued by [[Robert L. Carter]], who had earlier initiated some of the cases consolidated at the Supreme Court into ''Brown I''. Even so, formal compliance with the provisions of these two cases was not expedited, and in [[U.S. Southern States|the South]] most public schools would not be desegregated until about [[1970]] under the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration. Nearly twenty years after ''Brown'', school desegregation would come to the court's attention again in two cases involving the use of [[forced busing|busing]] to integrate students across school districts: ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'', {{ussc|402|1|[[1971]]}} and ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'', {{ussc|418|717|[[1974]]}}.

Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] wrote for the unanimous Court in ''Brown'':{{cquote|Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.<ref>[http://laws.findlaw.com/us/347/483.html Full text of decision courtesy of Findlaw.com]</ref>}}

==Social implications == 
Not everyone accepted the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' decision. In Virginia, Senator [[Harry F. Byrd, Sr.]] organized the [[Massive Resistance]] movement that included the closing of schools rather than desegregating them. See, for example, [[The Southern Manifesto]]. For more implications of the ''Brown'' decision, see [[Desegregation]].

In 1957, [[Arkansas]] Governor [[Orval Faubus]] called out his state's [[Arkansas Army National Guard|National Guard]] to block black students' entry to [[Little Rock High School]].  President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] responded by deploying elements of the [[101st Airborne Division]] from [[Fort Campbell]], Kentucky to Arkansas and by federalizing Faubus' National Guard.

Also in 1957, Florida's response was mixed. Its legislature passed an Interposition Resolution denouncing the decision and declaring it null and void. But Florida Governor Thomas LeRoy Collins refused to sign it arguing that the state must follow the Supreme Court's ruling. Tourism and Florida's popular image probably played a role in its muted response.

In 1963, [[Alabama]] Gov. [[George Wallace]] personally blocked the door to [[Foster Auditorium]] at the [[University of Alabama]] to prevent the enrollment of two black students. This became the infamous "Stand at the Schoolhouse Door," where Wallace personally backed his"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever." policy he stated in his 1963 inaugural address.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/wallace/sfeature/quotes.html The American Experience; George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire; Wallace Quotes], [[Public Broadcasting System]], pbs.org, 2000, accessed [[February 6]], 2007</ref> He moved aside only when confronted by federal marshals and Deputy Attorney General [[Nicholas Katzenbach]].

===Backlash and scientific racism ===
{{seealso|Scientific racism}}

The intellectual roots of [[Plessy v. Ferguson]], the landmark United States Supreme Court decision, upholding the constitutionality of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], under the doctrine of "[[separate but equal]]" were, in part, tied to the [[scientific racism]] of the era, however the popular support for the decision was more likely a result of the racist beliefs held by most whites at the time.<ref name="rlac">''Race, Law, and Culture: Reflections on Brown V. Board of Education'' By Austin Sarat. Page 55 and 59. 1997. ISBN 0195106229</ref> Later, the court decision, Brown v. Board of Education would reject the ideas of scientific racists about the need for segregation, especially in schools. Following that decision both scholarly and popular ideas of scientific racism played an important role in the attack and backlash that followed the court decision.<ref name="rlac">''Race, Law, and Culture: Reflections on Brown V. Board of Education'' By Austin Sarat. Page 55 and 59. 1997. ISBN 0195106229</ref> The ''[[Mankind Quarterly]]'' is a journal that has pubished scientific racism. It was founded in 1960, in part in response to the [[1954]] United States Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education which ordered the desegregation of US schools.<ref>''‘Scientific’ Racism Again?”:1 Reginald Gates, the Mankind Quarterly and the Question of “Race” in Science after the Second World War'' Journal of American Studies  (2007), 41: 253-278 Cambridge University Press</ref><ref name="jackson">''Science for Segregation: Race, Law, and the Case Against Brown V. Board of Education. by By John P. Jackson. ISBN 0814742718 Page 148</ref>  Many of the publication's contributors, publishers, and Board of Directors espouse academic [[hereditarianism]]. The publication is widely criticized for its extremist politics, anti-semitic bent and its support for scientific racism.<ref>e.g., Arvidsson, Stefan (2006), Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science, translated by Sonia Wichmann, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press.</ref>

==Legal criticism and praise==
[[William Rehnquist]] wrote a memo titled "A Random Thought on the Segregation Cases" when he was a law clerk for Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] in 1952, during early deliberations that led to the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' decision. In his memo, Rehnquist argued: "I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by 'liberal' colleagues but I think ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' was right and should be reaffirmed."  Rehnquist continued, "To the argument...that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory, in the long run it is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minorities are."<ref>William Rehnquist, [http://a255.g.akamaitech.net/7/255/2422/26sep20051215/www.gpoaccess.gov/congress/senate/judiciary/sh99-1067/324-325.pdf "A Random Thought on the Segregation Cases"], S. Hrg. 99-1067, Hearings Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the Nomination of Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United States (July 29, 30, 31, and August 1, 1986).</ref> Rehnquist also argued for ''Plessy'' with other law clerks.<ref>
Peter S. Canellos,[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/08/23/memos_may_not_hold_robertss_opinions/ Memos may not hold Roberts's opinions], [[The Boston Globe]], August 23, 2005.  Here is what Rehnquist said in 1986 about his conversations with other clerks about ''Plessy'':<blockquote>I thought ''Plessy'' had been wrongly decided at the time, that it was not a good interpretation of the equal protection clause to say that when you segregate people by race, there is no denial of equal protection.  But ''Plessy'' had been on the books for 60 years; Congress had never acted, and the same Congress that had promulgated the 14th Amendment had required segregation in the District schools.... I saw factors on both sides....I did not agree then, and I certainly do not agree now, with the statement that ''Plessy against Ferguson'' is right and should be reaffirmed.  I had ideas on both sides, and I do not think I ever really finally settled in my own  mind on that.... [A]round the lunch table I am sure I defended it....I thought there were good arguments to be made in support of it.</blockquote>S. Hrg. 99-1067, Hearings Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the Nomination of Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United States (July 29, 30, 31, and August 1, 1986).</ref>  However, during his 1971 confirmation hearings, Rehnquist said, "I believe that the memorandum was prepared by me as a statement of Justice Jackson's tentative views for his own use."  Justice Jackson had initially planned to join a dissent in ''Brown''.<ref>Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote: “In the original conference there were only four who voted that segregation in the public schools was unconstitutional.  Those four were Black, Burton, Minton, and myself.” See Bernard Schwartz, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Y5cUCl4hSWUC&pg=PA96&ots=5UtEFgR-B5&dq=%22May+17,+1954%22+and+%22memorandum+for+the+file%22&num=100&sig=JrgkG7MAPIwfCPRBYYtwY9XULP4 Decision: How the Supreme Court Decides Cases]'', page 96 (Oxford 1996).  Likewise, Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] wrote: “I have no doubt that if the segregation cases had reached decision last term, there would have been four dissenters – Vinson, Reed, Jackson, and Clark.”  Id.  Justice Jackson’s longtime legal secretary had a different view, calling Rehnquist’s Senate testimony an attempt to "smear the reputation of a great justice." See Alan Dershowitz, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-dershowitz/telling-the-truth-about-c_b_6844.html Telling the Truth About Chief Justice Rehnquist], [[Huffington Post]], [[September 5]], [[2005]], accessed [[March 15]], [[2007]].</ref>  Later, at his 1986 hearings for the slot of Chief Justice, Rehnquist put further distance between himself and the 1952 memo: "The bald statement that Plessy was right and should be reaffirmed, was not an accurate reflection of my own views at the time."<ref>Adam Liptak, ''[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/weekinreview/11lipt.html?ei=5088&en=5f85796f9c88b565&ex=1284091200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print The Memo That Rehnquist Wrote and Had to Disown]'', NY Times (September 11, 2005)</ref>  
In any event, while serving on the Supreme Court, Rehnquist made no effort to reverse or undermine the ''Brown'' decision, and frequently relied upon it as precedent.<ref>
[http://a255.g.akamaitech.net/7/255/2422/26sep20051215/www.gpoaccess.gov/congress/senate/judiciary/sh99-1067/303-305.pdf Cases where Justice Rehnquist has cited Brown v.

Hrg. 99-1067, Hearings Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the Nomination of Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United States (July 29, 30, 31, and August 1, 1986).  
<br />Also see Jeffery Rosen, [http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200504/rosen/2 Rehnquist the Great?], [[Atlantic Monthly]] (April 2005): "Rehnquist ultimately embraced the Warren Court's Brown decision, and after he joined the Court he made no attempt to dismantle the civil-rights revolution, as political opponents feared he would".</ref> 

Some aspects of the ''Brown'' decision are still debated. Notably, Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], himself an African American, wrote in [[Missouri v. Jenkins]] (1995) that at the very least, ''Brown I'' has been misunderstood by the courts. 

:Brown I did not say that "racially isolated" schools were inherently inferior; the harm that it identified was tied purely to de jure segregation, not de facto segregation. Indeed, Brown I itself did not need to rely upon any psychological or social-science research in order to announce the simple, yet fundamental truth that the Government cannot discriminate among its citizens on the basis of race....

:Segregation was not unconstitutional because it might have caused psychological feelings of inferiority. Public school systems that separated blacks and provided them with superior educational resources making blacks "feel" superior to whites sent to lesser schools - would violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether or not the white students felt stigmatized, just as do school systems in which the positions of the races are reversed. Psychological injury or benefit is irrelevant....

:Given that desegregation has not produced the predicted leaps forward in black educational achievement, there is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when surrounded by members of their own race as when they are in an integrated environment. (…) Because of their "distinctive histories and traditions,"  black schools can function as the center and symbol of black communities, and provide examples of independent black leadership, success, and achievement.<ref>''Missouri v. Jenkins'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&court=US&case=/us/515/70.html 515 U.S. 70 (1995)] (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref>

Some Constitutional [[originalists]], notably [[Raoul Berger]] in his influential 1977 book "Government by Judiciary," make the case that ''Brown'' cannot be defended by reference to the original understanding of the 14th Amendment. They support this reading of the 14th amendment by noting that the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] did not ban segregated schools. Other originalists, including  [[Michael W. McConnell]], a federal judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]], in his article "Originalism and the Desegregation Decisions," argue that the [[Reconstruction|Radical Reconstructionists]] who spearheaded the 14th Amendment were in favor of desegregated southern schools.

The case also has attracted some criticism from more liberal authors, including some who say that Chief Justice Warren's reliance on psychological criteria to find a harm against segregated blacks was unnecessary. For example, [[Drew S. Days]] has written:<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN081479890X&id=gL1YYW3MOyAC&pg=RA1-PA97&lpg=RA1-PA97&ots=XjVzgRg8WQ&dq=%22developed+criteria+for+evaluating+the+%22&sig=CaG_xa3sJXNlR4PVBQt4D9Cjd7Y#PRA1-PA97,M1 What 'Brown v. Board of Education' Should Have Said], [[Jack Balkin]] ed., page 97 (2001, New York University Press)</ref> "we have developed criteria for evaluating the constitutionality of racial classifications that do not depend upon findings of psychic harm or social science evidence. They are based rather on the principle that 'distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality,' ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'', 320 U.S. 81 (1943)...."

In his book "The Tempting of America" (page 82), [[Robert Bork]] endorsed the ''Brown'' decision as follows:

:By 1954, when Brown came up for decision, it had been apparent for some time that segregation rarely if ever produced equality. Quite aside from any question of psychology, the physical facilities provided for blacks were not as good as those provided for whites. That had been demonstrated in a long series of cases . . . The Court's realistic choice, therefore, was either to abandon the quest for equality by allowing segregation or to forbid segregation in order to achieve equality. There was no third choice. Either choice would violate one aspect of the original understanding, but there was no possibility of avoiding that. Since equality and segregation were mutually inconsistent, though the ratifiers did not understand that, both could not be honored. When that is seen, it is obvious the Court must choose equality and prohibit state-imposed segregation. The purpose that brought the fourteenth amendment into being was equality before the law, and equality, not separation, was written into the law.

Public officials in the United States today are nearly unanimous in lauding the ruling. In May 2004, the fiftieth anniversary of the ruling, President [[George W. Bush]] spoke at the opening of the "[[Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site]]", calling ''Brown'' "a decision that changed America for the better, and forever."<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/05/20040517-4.html ''Remarks by the President at Grand Opening of the Brown v Board of Education National Historic Site''], Topeka, Kansas (May 17, 2004)</ref> Most Senators and Representatives issued press releases hailing the ruling.

==Brown II==
In 1955, the Supreme Court considered arguments by the schools requesting relief concerning the task of desegregation. In ''Brown II'' the court delegated the task of carrying out the desegregation to district courts with orders that desegregation occur "with all deliberate speed," a phrase traceable to [[Francis Thompson]]'s poem, [[Hound of Heaven|''The Hound of Heaven'']].  Some supporters of the earlier decision were displeased with this decision.  The language “all deliberate speed” was seen by critics as too ambiguous to ensure reasonable haste for compliance with the court's instruction.

==Brown III==
In 1978, Topeka attorneys Richard Jones, Joseph Johnson and Charles Scott Jr. (son of the original ''Brown'' team member), with assistance from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], persuaded Linda Brown Smith&mdash;who now had her own children in Topeka schools&mdash;to be a plaintiff in reopening ''Brown''. They were concerned that the Topeka Public Schools' policy of "open enrollment" had led to and would lead to further segregation. They also believed that with a choice of open enrollment, white parents would shift their children to "preferred" schools that would create both predominantly African American and predominantly European American schools within the district. The district court reopened the ''Brown'' case after a 25-year hiatus, but denied the plaintiffs' request finding the schools "unitary". In [[1989]], a three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Circuit]] on 2-1 vote found that the vestiges of segregation remained with respect to student and staff assignment. In 1993, the Supreme Court denied the appellant School District's request for ''[[certiorari]]'' and returned the case to District Court Judge Richard Rodgers for implementation of the Tenth Circuit's mandate.

After a 1994 plan was approved and a bond issue passed, additional elementary magnet schools were opened and district attendance plans redrawn which resulted in the Topeka schools meeting court standards of racial balance by 1998. Unified status was eventually granted to Topeka Unified School District #501 on July 27, 1999. One of the new [[magnet schools]] is named after the Scott family attorneys for their role in the ''Brown'' case and civil rights.<ref>[https://www2.topeka.k12.ks.us/scott/history.htm ''Topeka Public Schools Desegregation History: "The Naming of Scott Computer Technology Magnet"'']</ref>

==Common misconceptions==

*The most common misconception about ''Brown v. Board of Education'' is that the case is solely about Linda Brown and whether she should or should not be able to attend the school nearest her home.  In fact, ''Brown'' was a consolidation of five different cases, from four states, all of which dealt with the same issue. (A similar case from the District of Columbia was handled separately.) Linda Brown was merely the "poster child," as it were, for some 200 plaintiffs altogether. A dozen attorneys and countless community activists were involved in effort to eliminate "de jure" racial segregation in the public schools.<ref>[http://brownvboard.org/summary/ Background Summary] at brownvboard.org. Accessed 18 March 2007.</ref>
*The second most common misconception is that the case talks about the hardship that affected Linda Brown because she was not able to attend her local school, because it was for white children only. In fact, the case discusses the hardships collectively faced by all of the children concerned. It also focuses a lot of attention on the psychological well-being of the children in reference to the segregation of schools.<ref>[http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whoweare/exhibits/brown/whatwas.htm What Was Brown v. Board of Education?], an exhibition at the Library of Virginia. Accessed 27 August 2006.</ref>
*It is sometimes thought that Oliver Brown was the named plaintiff in the consolidated cases because he was alphabetically first in the list ("Brown" - 'B'). In fact, ''Darlene'' Brown (no relation to Oliver Brown) would have been the named plaintiff if that had actually been the case, since "D. Brown" comes before "O. Brown."
*It is also frequently thought that ''Brown'' was the first legal challenge to racially segregated schools in the United States. In fact, it was the eleventh case to challenge the [[1879]] Kansas law, and the third case from Topeka.<ref>[http://brownvboard.org/research/opinions/opinions.htm Opinions] at brownvboard.org.
