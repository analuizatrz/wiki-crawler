'''''Another Perfect Day''''' is the seventh album by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Motörhead]]. The album was released in 1983 and reached number 20 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] charts.

After guitarist [[Eddie Clarke|"Fast" Eddie Clarke]] left Motörhead on their second [[United States|US]] tour, [[Brian Robertson|Brian "Robbo" Robertson]] (ex-[[Thin Lizzy]]) was drafted to complete the tour. On their return to the UK the band recorded their unique and controversial album - ''Another Perfect Day''.

Although it is the most melodic and unique album Motörhead had ever recorded, the fans were not pleased; Robertson and [[Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor]] went to form the band ''Operator'' and Lemmy went on with Motörhead, forming the new line-up of Lemmy, [[Phil Campbell (musician)|Phil Campbell]], [[Würzel]], [[Pete Gill]].

The original vinyl release has a lyric-sheet insert, with a cartoon storyboard of the adventures of the new band, as it were.

In 1988 Castle Communications re-issued this album  along with ''[[Overkill (album)|Overkill]]'' – in a gatefold sleeve.

The [[thrash metal]] band [[Sepultura]] named themselves after the third track from this album, "Dancing on Your Grave".<ref>Max Cavalera tells how this came to be after translating the lyrics to the "Dancing on Your Grave" on the video ''Third World Chaos''.</ref>

==Sleeve artwork==
[[Joe Petagno]], the sleeve artist, commented that the cover was borne of upheaval prevalent in the band and its members at the time:
<blockquote>I didn't hear the music. I think I got a rough mix. It was different. But, I did it on a beer box, with a drawing board on my lap and some paints and a bucket of water by my side. And the reason it turned out the way it was – it was all chaos. Chaos in my life, and chaos in Lemmy's life. I brought it to London with me to deliver it personally to the guys and everyone was freaked over it. They'd never seen anything like it. And I remember Philthy said, "Fuck man! If the kids see that on acid, they're just going to freak!" It's one of my favourite sleeves.<ref>''About Joe Petagno'' - interview section with [[Joe Petagno]], bonus DVD with ''[[Inferno (album)#30th Anniversary DVD content|Inferno 30th Anniversary edition]]'' SPV69748.</ref></blockquote>
