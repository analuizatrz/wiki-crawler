'''John David Tatum''' (born [[November 18]], [[1948]]) is a former [[American football]] [[defensive back]] who played ten seasons from [[1971 in sports|1971]] to [[1980 in sports|1980]] for the [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[Houston Oilers]] in the [[National Football League]]. He is popularly known as the "Assassin." <ref>[http://www.raiderdrive.com/jack_tatum_the_legend.htm The man, the legend, the "Assassin"] Retrieved [[April 1]], [[2006]].</ref>  He was voted to three [[Pro Bowls]] ([[1973 NFL season|1973]]-[[1975 NFL season|1975]]) and won one [[Super Bowl]] in his nine seasons with the Raiders.

Tatum earned a reputation as a fierce competitor and was considered as one of the hardest hitters ever to play the game.<ref>[http://www.raiders.com/history/whatever_tatum.jsp Whatever happened to Jack Tatum] Retrieved [[April 1]], [[2006]].</ref> In a recent poll by [[Sports Illustrated]] on the century's best defensive backs, Tatum finished with eight percent of the vote.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/POLL/results/182421.html Sports Illustrated poll] Retrieved [[April 2]], [[2006]].</ref> He is best known for a tackle he made against former [[New England Patriots]] [[wide receiver]] [[Darryl Stingley]] in a [[1978 in sports|1978]] scrimmage that paralyzed Stingley from the chest down and for his involvement in the notorious [[Immaculate Reception]] play during a playoff game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

==College career==
Tatum was born in [[Cherryville, North Carolina|Cherryville]], [[North Carolina]] and grew up in [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], [[New Jersey]], where he had little interest in playing sports in his early years. Tatum did not start playing football until he entered his sophomore year in [[Passaic High School]], where he played as a running back, fullback and defensive back and was selected first-team All-State.  He was selected a high school [[All-America|All-American]] as a high school senior. In 1999, the New Jersey [[Star-Ledger]] named Tatum as one of New Jersey's top ten defensive players of the century.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/hssports/ledger/index.ssf?/hssports/century/stories/footballtop10d.html Top 10 Defensive Players] Retrieved [[April 2]], [[2006]].</ref> 

Tatum visited a number of universities before starting his collegiate career on the [[Ohio State University]] [[Buckeyes]] team. [[Head coach]] [[Woody Hayes]] recruited Tatum as a [[running back]], however, assistant coach [[Lou Holtz]] convinced Hayes to switch Tatum to defensive back during Tatum's freshman season. <ref>[http://www.collegefootballnews.com/Top_100_Players/Top_100_Players_51_Jack_Tatum.htm Collegefootballnews top 100 college players of all time, number 51 Jack Tatum] Retrieved [[April 1]], [[2006]].</ref>  Tatum was used by the Buckeyes to cover the opposing team's best [[wide receiver]] but he also was used occasionally as a [[linebacker]] because of his hitting skills. 

Tatum was a first team All-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] in 1968, [[1969 in sports#Football (American)|1969]] and [[1970 in sports#Football (American)|1970]]. In 1969 and 1970 he was a unanimous All American. In 1970 he was selected as the National Defensive Player of the Year and was among the top vote getters for the [[Heisman Trophy]] which is given to the nation's best college football player.<ref>Tatum, Jack Final Confessions of NFL Assassin: Coal Valley Il, Quality Sports Publications,  pg 9.</ref> Tatum helped lead the Buckeyes to a 27-2 record in his three seasons as a starter, with two national championship appearances and one national championship win in [[1968 in sports#American football|1968]], Tatum's first season with the team.  

Tatum was inducted into the [[Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame]] in 1981 <ref>[http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/genrel/osu-mhof.html Men's Varsity "O" Hall of Fame]</ref> and into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] <ref>[http://www.footballfoundation.com/news.php?id=329 2004 College Football Hall of Fame Division I-A Class Announced] Retrieved [[April 2]], [[2006]]</ref> in 2005.  In [[2001 in sports#Football (American)|2001]], Ohio State head coach [[Jim Tressel]] instituted the "Jack Tatum Hit of the Week Award," given to the player who had the most impressive defensive hit of the game.

Tatum was drafted by the [[Oakland Raiders]] as the 19th pick in the first round of the [[1971 NFL Draft]] to replace former Oakland safety, [[Dave Grayson]], who retired after the 1970 season. A few weeks later, Tatum signed a three year, six figure contract with a fifty thousand dollar-signing bonus.<ref>Tatum, pg 9</ref> When the contract was released to the press, there was a statement that state that the Raiders hired the ''Assassin'', hence his nickname. Tatum then played his first professional game against the [[Baltimore Colts]], where he tackled and knocked out the Colts' former [[tight end]]s [[John Mackey (American football)|John Mackey]] and [[Tom Mitchell]]. Soon after the game, sportswriters started to compare him to former [[Chicago Bears]] [[linebacker]] [[Dick Butkus]] because of his hard-hitting skills<ref>Tatum, pg 11</ref> and he became the starting free safety in his rookie year.

Tatum was involved in one of the most famous plays in National Football League History, the [[Immaculate Reception]], during a [[1972 in sports|1972]] playoff game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. With 22 seconds left in the game, Steelers [[quarterback]] [[Terry Bradshaw]] threw a pass to running back [[John Fuqua]]. Tatum collided with Fuqua, knocking the ball into the air.  The ball fell into Steelers running back [[Franco Harris]]'s arms, who ran it down 42 yards for a game winning touchdown.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04292/397451.stm The physics of the matter say the Immaculate Reception ball hit Tatum by Byron Spice, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette] Retrieved [[April 1]], [[2006]].</ref>

In one of the most lasting images from [[Super Bowl XI]], Tatum knocked the helmet off [[Minnesota Vikings]] wide receiver [[Sammy White (American football)|Sammy White]]. This is considered as one of the biggest hits in Super Bowl history.<ref>[http://proxy.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/ballot?event_id=1979 Top Super Bowl Plays - Defense/Special Teams] Retrieved [[April 2]], [[2006]].</ref> But his most infamous hit was in a [[1978 NFL season|1978]] preseason game against the [[New England Patriots]].  Tatum hit Patriots wide receiver [[Darryl Stingley]] as he was leaping for a pass. This badly damaged Stingley's [[spinal cord]] and left him paralyzed from the chest down.  Tatum claims that he attempted to visit Stingley in the hospital soon after the hit but was forbidden by Stingley's family.<ref>[http://www.thescizone.com/news/articles/221/1/Stingley,-Tatum-might-reunite Stingley, Tatum might reunite] Retrieved [[April 2]], [[2006]].</ref>  The two have not spoken since that day.<ref>[http://www.thirdside.org/stories_26.cfm The Healer: No String Of Bitterness by Ron Burges Boston Globe] Retrieved [[April 1]], [[2006]].</ref> Tatum has never apologized for the hit. ''"I don't think I did anything wrong that I need to apologize for. It was a clean hit."'' Neither the NFL nor Stingley have taken action against Tatum. Tatum also never tried talking to Stingley about the incident until he was promoting his autobiography.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/readers/hatedfootballplayers.html The Readers' List:Least likable footballer] Retrieved [[April 4]], [[2006]].</ref>
In 1997, Tatum asked the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] if they could give him a ''catastrophic injury'' pension for having to live through the Stingley incident but the league declined after thinking it wasn't a catastrophic injury.<ref>[http://www.mtjuliet.org/sermons/archives/001690.html Conscience] Retrieved [[April 2]], [[2006]].</ref> 

Tatum was traded to the [[Houston Oilers]] for running back [[Kenny King]] and two draft choices in the [[1980 NFL Draft]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406EEDA1538F93AA15756C0A967948260 Oilers Waive Jack Tatum, from the May 29, 1981 issue of the New York Times], Retrieved [[April 2]], [[2006]].</ref> He finished his pro career with them in [[1980 NFL season|1980]], when he played all sixteen games that season, and recorded a career-high seven interceptions to finish with a career total of 37, which he returned for 736 yards.  He also recovered nine fumbles in his career, returning them for 164 yards.  Tatum also holds the record for the longest fumble return in NFL history. In a [[1972 NFL season|1972]] game against the [[Green Bay Packers]], he returned a fumble 104 yards for a touchdown which could have been called back because of an officiating error.<ref>[http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/news/oct03/175937.asp Lambeau's Lowlights] Retrieved [[April 2]], [[2006]].</ref> The record has since been tied by [[Aeneas Williams]].<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/indiv/fumbles Individual Records: Fumbles], Retrieved [[April 1]], [[2006]]</ref>

==After football==
After being released by the Oilers after the 1980 season, Tatum retired. After his playing career ended, Tatum became a land developer and moved into the real-estate business becoming a part-owner of a restaurant in [[Pittsburg, California|Pittsburg]], [[California]]. Tatum also married, and had three children. He wrote three best-selling books, ''They Call me Assassin'' in 1980, ''They Still Call Me Assassin'' in 1989, and ''Final Confessions of NFL Assassin Jack Tatum'' in 1996. 

Tatum would eventually face his own disability as his left leg was amputated below the knee in 2003 due to a [[staph infection]] caused by [[diabetes]]. Tatum also suffered from an arterial blockage that almost cost him his right leg. He currently uses a prosthetic leg to walk around or a [[wheelchair]]. Tatum currently works in increasing awareness of diabetes. To facilitate this goal, he created the Ohio-based Jack Tatum Fund for Youthful Diabetes, which finances diabetes research.

Prior to [[Super Bowl XL]], [[ESPN]] [[Andrea Kremer]] did an interview with Tatum confirming that he still has few regrets about paralyzing Stingley.<ref>[http://www.bostonsportsmedia.com/archives/blitz/2006/02/highlights_and.php Highlights and lowlights of a Super Bowl bonanza], Retrieved [[April 2]], [[2006]].</ref>
