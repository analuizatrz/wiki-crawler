'''''300''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[film adaptation]] of the [[graphic novel]] [[300 (comics)|of the same name]] by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], and is a fictionalized retelling of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]. The film is directed by [[Zack Snyder]] while Miller served as [[executive producer]] and consultant. The film was shot mostly with a super-imposition [[chroma key]] technique, to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book.

[[Sparta]]n [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] ([[Gerard Butler]]) and 300 Spartans fight to the last man against [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Divine king|'God-King']] [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]) and his army of more than one million soldiers. As the battle rages, [[Gorgo (Sparta)|Queen Gorgo]] ([[Lena Headey]]) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The story is framed by a [[voice-over]] narrative by the Spartan soldier [[Aristodemus (Spartan)|Dilios]] ([[David Wenham]]). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing ''300'' within the genre of [[historical fantasy]].

''300'' was released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters in the United States on March 9, 2007, and on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]] on July 31, 2007. The film broke [[box office]] records, although critics were divided over its look and style. Some acclaimed it as an original achievement, while others criticized it for favoring visuals over [[characterization]] and its controversial depiction of the ancient Persians.

==Plot==
<!-- ATTENTION! PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING! Please help keep this section brief. Every detail about the plot of 300 or every funny quote does not belong here. --> <!-- Also, the quote "THIS IS SPARTA!!" or "PREPARE FOR BATTLE!" isn't necessary, you can hear it in many other places & everyone knows it by now -->
Over Dilios' narration, the life of young [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] is depicted. Cast into the wild to fend for his life per [[Agoge|Spartan doctrine]], Leonidas survives the harsh winter and returns home to be crowned King.

Years later, messengers arrive at the gates of [[Sparta]] demanding its submission to King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Outraged and offended by their threats and behavior, King [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] and his guards kick the messengers into a pit. Acknowledging the threat of Xerxes's invasion force, he visits the [[Ephor]]s proposing a strategy to repel the numerically superior enemy by using the terrain of [[Thermopylae]] (the Hot Gates), which would funnel the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea. The Ephors, wary of Leonidas' plans, consult [[Pythia|the Oracle]], who in her trance decrees that Sparta must not go to war, lest they interrupt the sacred [[Carneian festival]]. As Leonidas departs a messenger from Xerxes appears, rewarding the Ephors a mountain of gold in return for their covert support.

Despite the Oracle's orders, Leonidas decides on a leisurely walk to the Hot Gates, gathering 300 of his best soldiers to act as his personal bodyguards. Along the way, they are joined by a force consisting of [[Arcadia]]ns and various other [[Greeks]] before arriving at the Hot Gates of [[Thermopylae]]. In sight of the approaching Persian army, they construct a wall to contain the Persians' advance. Leonidas meanwhile encounters [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]], a hunchbacked Spartan who requests a private audience with the King. A severely disfigured child, his parents fled Sparta to spare him certain [[Sparta#Society|infanticide]]. Ephialtes asks to redeem his father's name by joining Leonidas in battle against the Persians and warns him of a secret goat path the Persians could use to outflank and surround them. Leonidas is sympathetic to the eager warrior, but rejects him upon realizing that Ephialtes cannot properly hold a shield, which would compromise the Spartans' [[phalanx formation|phalanx]].

Prior to the battle the Persians demand that the Spartans drop their arms and surrender. Leonidas refuses and challenges the Persians to [[Molon labe|come and take their weapons from them]]. With their tightly-knit phalanx formation, the Spartans funnel the Persians into the narrow terrain, repeatedly rebuffing them and inflicting heavy casualties. Xerxes, impressed with Spartan fighting skill, personally approaches Leonidas to persuade him to surrender. He promises Leonidas wealth and power in exchange for his loyalty. Leonidas declines, promising instead to make the "[[Divine king|God King]]" bleed, and turns to rejoin his army. Dismayed at the refusal, Xerxes dispatches the feared [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]] (his elite personal guard), whom the Spartans draw into a trap and narrowly defeat. The battles continue, with the Spartans prevailing over soldiers and animals drawn from the vast reaches of the Persian empire: from Mongolian barbarians and Eastern chemists to African [[rhinoceros]]es and Indian [[war elephant]]s. After two days of fighting however, an embittered Ephialtes defects to Xerxes and reveals the location of the goat path.

In Sparta, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] attempts to enlist the influential Theron to help persuade the Spartan council to send reinforcements to Leonidas. Theron agrees, but demands that Gorgo submit sexually to him, which she reluctantly consents to. At the Hot Gates, the Greeks realize Ephialtes' treachery and the Arcadians' retreat in the face of certain death. The Spartans, [[Battle of Thermopylae#Epitaph of Simonides|obedient to their law]], refuse to follow, and Leonidas orders a reluctant Dilios to return and orate the story of the valiant 300 to ensure their memory. In Sparta, Queen Gorgo appeals to the council but is betrayed by Theron, who publicly accuses her of [[adultery]] in an attempt to discredit her. Enraged by his betrayal, Gorgo snatches a sword and kills Theron, rupturing a bag of Xerxes' gold in the folds of his robe and spilling it onto the ground. With this evidence, the Council denounces Theron as a traitor and unites against Persia.

At the Hot Gates, as the Persians surround the Spartans, Xerxes's [[General Officer|general]] demands their surrender, declaring that Leonidas may keep his title as [[Kings of Sparta|King of Sparta]] and become [[Warlord]] of all Greece, answerable only to Xerxes. Ephialtes begs him to do so as well, to which Leonidas remarks "May you live forever," an insult from a culture valuing death and valor in battle. Leonidas drops his shield and removes his helmet, seemingly bowing in submission. Stelios then leaps over him and kills the general. A furious Xerxes orders his troops to attack. As Persian archers shoot the remaining Spartans, Leonidas rises and hurls his spear at Xerxes, ripping open his cheek, thus making "the God-King bleed." Xerxes, visibly shaken by this reminder of his own mortality, watches as the remaining Spartans perish beneath the combined might of his army.

Concluding his tale before an audience of attentive Spartans, Dilios declares that the 120,000-strong Persian army that narrowly defeated 300 Spartans now faces 10,000 Spartans commanding 30,000 Greeks. Praising Leonidas's sacrifice, Dilios leads the assembled Greek army into a fierce charge against the Persian army, igniting the [[Battle of Plataea]].

Producer Gianni Nunnari was not the only person planning a film about the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]; director [[Michael Mann (film director)|Michael Mann]] already planned a film of the battle based on the book ''[[Gates of Fire]]''.

Two months of [[pre-production]] were required to create hundreds of shields, spears and swords, some of which were recycled from ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' and ''[[Alexander (film)|Alexander]]''. An [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were also created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers.<ref name="SHH set visit">{{cite news |last= Douglas |first= Edward |title= ''300'': The Set Visit! |publisher= SuperHeroHype.com |date= [[2007-01-05]] |url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/300news.php?id=5064 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

{{main|300 (soundtrack)}}
In July 2005, composer [[Tyler Bates]] had begun work on the film, describing the score as having "beautiful themes on the top and large choir," but "tempered with some extreme heaviness." The composer had scored for a test scene that the director wanted to show to Warner Bros. to illustrate the path of the project. Bates said that the score had "a lot of weight and intensity in the low end of the percussion" that Snyder found agreeable to the film.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel Robert |last=Epstein |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/tylerbates_music/interview.asp | title=Exclusive Interview with Tyler Bates, Score Composer for ''The Devil's Rejects'' |publisher=[[UGO]] |date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] and features the vocals of [[Azam Ali]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Warner Bros.

The score has given rise to some controversy in the film composer community, garnering criticism for its striking similarity to several other recent soundtracks, including [[James Horner]] and [[Gabriel Yared]]'s work for the film ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]''. The heaviest borrowings are said to be from [[Elliot Goldenthal]]'s 1999 [[Titus (soundtrack)|score]] for ''[[Titus (film)|Titus]]''. "Remember Us," from ''300'', is identical in parts to the "[[Titus (soundtrack)#Audio|Finale]]" from ''Titus'', and "Returns a King" is similar to the cue "[[Titus (soundtrack)#Audio|Victorius Titus]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musiconfilm.net/get_review.php?id=163 |title=300 |accessdate=2007-03-18 |author=Justin Bielawa |date=[[2007-02-27]] |publisher=Music On Film|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmusiconfilm.net%2Fget_review.php%3Fid%3D163&date=2008-09-28|archivedate=2008-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movie-wave.net/titles/300.html |title=300 |accessdate=2007-03-18 |author=James Southall |publisher=Movie Wave}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://scoremagacine.com/Resenas_det.php?Codigo=715 |title=300 |accessdate=2007-03-18 |author=Demetris Christodoulides |publisher=Score Magazine|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscoremagacine.com%2FResenas_det.php%3FCodigo%3D715&date=2008-09-28|archivedate=2008-09-28}}</ref> (see [[300 (soundtrack)#Copyright issues|Copyright issues]]) However, on August 3, 2007, Warner Bros.

''300's'' director [[Zack Snyder]] stated in an MTV interview that "The events are 90 percent accurate. It's just in the visualization that it's crazy.... I've shown this movie to world-class historians who have said it's amazing. They can't believe it's as accurate as it is." He continues that the film is "an opera, not a documentary.

[[Paul Cartledge]], Professor of [[History of Greece|Greek History]] at [[Cambridge University]], advised the filmmakers on the [[Ancient Greek phonology|pronunciation of Greek]] names, and states that they "made good use" of his published work on Sparta. He praises the film for its portrayal of "the Spartans' heroic code," and of "the key role played by women in backing up, indeed reinforcing, the male martial code of heroic honor," while expressing reservations about its "'West' (goodies) vs 'East' (baddies) polarization."<ref>{{cite news |author=Dan Vergano ||title=This is Sparta?

Ephraim Lytle, assistant professor of Hellenistic History at the [[University of Toronto]], states that ''300'' selectively idealizes Spartan society in a "problematic and disturbing" fashion, as well as portraying the "hundred nations of the Persians" as monsters and non-Spartan Greeks as weak. He suggests that the film's moral universe would have seemed as "bizarre to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] as it does to modern historians."<ref name="Lytle">{{cite news |author=Ephraim Lytle |title=Sparta?

[[Victor Davis Hanson]], formerly professor of Classical history at [[California State University, Fresno]], who wrote the foreword to a 2007 re-issue of the graphic novel, states that the film demonstrates a specific affinity with the original material of [[Herodotus]] in that it captures the martial ethos of ancient Sparta and represents Thermopylae as a "clash of civilizations". He remarks that [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], [[Aeschylus]] and [[Herodotus]] viewed Thermopylae as a battle against "Eastern centralism and collective serfdom", which opposed "the idea of the free citizen of an autonomous polis".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/rev2007-03-07vdh.html |title=With Your Shield or On It |accessdate=2007-03-18 |author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=2007-03-07 |publisher=[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]}}</ref> He further states that the film portrays the battle in a "surreal" manner, and that the intent was to "entertain and shock first, and instruct second."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/VictorDavisHanson/2007/03/22/300_fact_or_fiction |title='300' Fact or Fiction? |accessdate=2007-03-23 |author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=[[2007-03-22]] |publisher=Townhall.com}}</ref>

[[Touraj Daryaee]], associate professor of Ancient History at [[California State University, Fullerton]], criticizes the movie's use of classical sources, writing:  
<blockquote>
Some passages from the Classical authors Aeschylus, [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], Herodotus and [[Plutarch]] are spilt over the movie to give it an authentic flavor. Aeschylus becomes a major source when the battle with the “monstrous human herd” of the Persians is narrated in the film. Diodorus’ statement about Greek valor to preserve their liberty is inserted in the film, but his mention of Persian valor is omitted. Herodotus’ fanciful numbers are used to populate the Persian army, and Plutarch’s discussion of Greek women, specifically Spartan women, is inserted wrongly in the dialogue between the “misogynist” Persian ambassador and the Spartan king. Classical sources are certainly used, but exactly in all the wrong places, or quite naively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranian.com/Daryaee/2007/March/300/index.html |title=Go tell the Spartans |accessdate=2007-03-23 |author=Touraj Daryaee |date=[[2007-03-14]]|publisher=iranian.com}}</ref>

[[Image:300- Leonidas and Xerxes discuss surrender.jpg|150px|thumb|Some criticized the portrayal of King Xerxes as "androgynous".]]
Before the release of ''300'', Warner Brothers expressed concerns about the political aspects of the film's theme.

Outside the current political parallels, some critics have raised more general questions about the film's ideological orientation. The ''[[New York Post]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s  [[Kyle Smith]] writes that the film would have pleased "[[Adolf Hitler|Adolf]]'s boys",<ref>{{cite news |author=Kyle Smith |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03092007/entertainment/movies/persian_shrug_movies_kyle_smith.htm |title=Persian Shrug |publisher=[[New York Post]] |date=[[2007-03-09]] |accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'''s Dana Stevens compares the film to [[The Eternal Jew (film)|''The Eternal Jew'']], "as a textbook example of how race-baiting fantasy and nationalist myth can serve as an incitement to total war".<ref name="Slate">{{cite news |author=Dana Stevens |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2161450/ |title=A Movie Only a Spartan Could Love |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=[[2007-03-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> Roger Moore, a critic for the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', relates ''300'' to [[Susan Sontag]]'s definition of "[[fascist]] art".<ref>{{cite news |author=Roger Moore |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2007/03/300_as_fascist_.html |title=300 as Fascist Art |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=[[2007-03-07]] |accessdate=2007-03-16 }}</ref>

The film's portrayal of ancient [[Persian people|Persians]] caused a particularly strong reaction in [[Iran]].<ref name=hnn>{{cite news |author=Gary Leupp|title=A Racist and Insulting Film - 300 vs. Iran (and Herodotus| url=http://www.counterpunch.org/leupp03312007.html|publisher=COUNTERPUNCH|date=[[2007-03-31]] |accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref>  [[Azadeh Moaveni]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that [[Tehran]] was "outraged" following the film's release.

[[Slovenia]]n philosopher and author [[Slavoj Žižek]] defended the movie from those who attacked it as an example of "the worst kind of patriotic militarism with clear allusions to recent tensions with Iran and Iraq." He wrote that the story represents a "poor, small country (Greece) invaded by the army of a much larger state (Persia)," suggesting that the identification of the Spartans with a modern superpower is flawed. Instead of seeing a "fundamentalist" aspect in the Spartan identity, he stated that "all modern egalitarian radicals, from [[Rousseau]] to the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]]…imagined the republican France as a new Sparta".<ref name="The ">{{cite web|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizhollywood.htm|last = Žižek|first = Slavoj| author-link = Slavoj Žižek| title = The True Hollywood Left| publisher = www.lacan.com}}</ref>

In response to the criticisms, a Warner Bros. spokesman stated that the film ''300'' "is a work of fiction inspired by the Frank Miller graphic novel and loosely based on a historical event. The studio developed this film purely as a fictional work with the sole purpose of entertaining audiences; it is not meant to disparage an ethnicity or culture or make any sort of [[political statement]]."<ref name="hnn" />

==Popular culture==
''300'' has been [[parody|spoofed]] in various media, spawning the "This is Sparta!" [[internet meme]],<ref>{{cite web | author= Steve Spalding | url= http://howtosplitanatom.com/news/how-to-explore-internet-memes/ | title=How To Explore Internet Memes | publisher=[http://howtosplitanatom.com/ How to Split an Atom] | date=[[2007-09-30]] | accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref> with parodies also appearing in film and television. These include the [[Short subject|short]] ''[[United 300]]'', which won the Movie Spoof Award at the [[MTV Movie Awards 2007|2007 MTV Movie Awards]]. [[Sketch comedy|Skits]] based upon the film have appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''<ref>[http://backwardfive.com/2007/03/24/saturday-night-live-march-24-2007/ ''Saturday Night Live'', March 24, 2007]</ref> and ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', the latter of which mimicked the visual style of ''300'' in a parody set during the American Revolutionary War, titled "1776".<ref>[http://www.weshow.com/us/p/20903/1776_robot_chicken_300_spoof "Moesha Poppins"], Robot Chicken episode #50</ref><ref>[http://www.tv.com/robot-chicken/moesha-poppins/episode/1129271/summary.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=episodessh&tag=episodes;title;1 "Moesha Poppins" episode summary]</ref>

[[20th Century Fox]] released ''[[Meet the Spartans]]'', a spoof of ''300''. [[Universal Pictures]] is planning a similar parody, titled ''National Lampoon's 301: The Legend of Awesomest Maximus Wallace Leonidas''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Jeff Giles | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/national_lampoons_christmas_vacation_2_cousin_eddies_big_island_adventure/news/1676825/ | title=National Lampoon + Kevin Dillon = A 300 Spoof | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=[[2007-10-03]] | accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref>

''300'' was also parodied in an episode of ''[[South Park]]'' named "[[D-Yikes!]]".<ref>{{cite news | author=Travis Fuckett | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/780/780079p1.html | title=South Park: "D-Yikes" Review | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2007-04-12]] | accessdate=2007-12-29 }}</ref>

==Sequel/prequel==
In June 2008, producers Mark Canton, Gianni Nunnari and Bernie Goldmann revealed that work had begun on a sequel/prequel to ''300''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Frosty | url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/8326/tcid/1 | title=Producers Mark Canton, Gianni Nunnari and Bernie Goldmann Exclusive Video Interview | publisher=Collider.com | date=[[2008-06-25]] | accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> Legendary Pictures has announced that Frank Miller is writing the follow-up graphic novel, and Zack Snyder has declared his interest in directing the adaptation.
