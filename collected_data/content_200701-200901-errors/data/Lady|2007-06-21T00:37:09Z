A '''lady''' is a [[woman]] who is the counterpart of a [[lord]]; or, the counterpart of a [[gentleman]].

== Etymology and usage ==
The word comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''hlaifdige''; the first part of the word is ''laif'', loaf, [[bread]], as in the corresponding ''hlaford'', lord; the second part is usually taken to be from the root ''dig-'', to knead, seen also in [[dough]]; the sense development from bread-kneader, bread-maker, to the ordinary meaning, though not clearly to be traced historically, may be illustrated by that of lord.  

The primary meaning of "mistress of a household" is now mostly obsolete, save for the occasional use of old-fashioned phrases such as "lady of the house." This meaning is retained, however, in the title [[First Lady]], used for the wife of an elected [[president]] or [[prime minister]]. In many cultures in Europe the equivalent term serves as a general title of address equivalent to the English ''[[missus]]'' (usually seen as ''Mrs.'') ([[French language|French]] ''[[Madame]]'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Señora'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Signora'', [[German language|German]] ''Frau'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''Pani'')

The special use of the word as a title of the [[Mary the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], usually ''Our Lady'', represents the [[Latin]] ''Domina Nostra''. In [[Lady Day]] and Lady Chapel the word is properly a [[genitive case|genitive]], representing the ''hlaefdigan''.  

The word is also used as a title of the [[Wicca|Wiccan]] Goddess, ''The Lady''.

== British usage ==
As a title of nobility the uses of "Lady" are mainly paralleled by those of "Lord". It is thus a less formal alternative to the full title giving the specific rank, of [[marchioness (title)|marchioness]], [[countess]], [[viscountess]] or [[baroness]], whether as the title of the husband's rank by right or courtesy, or as the lady's title in her own right. A widow becomes the [[dowager]], e.g. ''The Dowager Lady Smith''.

In the case of sons of a [[duke]] or [[marquess]], who by courtesy have "Lord" prefixed to their given and family name, the wife is known by the husband's given and family name with "Lady" prefixed, e.g. ''Lady John Smith''; the daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls are by courtesy Ladies; here that title is prefixed to the given and family name of the lady, e.g. ''Lady Jane Smith'', and this is preserved if the lady marries a [[commoner]], e.g. ''Mr John and Lady Jane Smith''. 

"Lady" is also the customary title of the wife of a [[baronet]] or [[knight]]; the proper title, now only used in [[legal documents]] or on [[sepulchral monuments]], is "[[Dame (title)|Dame]]"; in the latter case the usage is to prefix "Dame" to the given name of the wife followed by the surname of the husband, thus ''Dame Jane Smith'', but in the former, "Lady" with the surname of the husband only, ''Sir John and Lady Smith''. When a wife divorces a knight and he marries again, the new wife will be ''Lady Smith'' while the previous wife becomes ''Jane, Lady Smith''. If he then dies his widow becomes ''Dowager Lady Smith'' (no ''the''). During the [[fifteenth century|15th]] and [[sixteenth century|16th centuries]] [[princess]]es or daughters of the [[Royal family|blood royal]] were usually known by their Christian names with "The Lady" prefixed, e.g. ''The Lady Elizabeth''.

== More recent usage: social class ==
In more recent years, usage of the word ''lady'' is even more complicated.  Remarks made by the [[journalism|journalist]] [[William Allen White]] in his [[1946]] [[autobiography]] indicate part of the difficulties.  White relates that a woman who had paid a [[fine]] for [[prostitution]] came to his newspaper to protest, not that the fact of her conviction was reported, but that the newspaper referred to her as a "woman" rather than a "lady."  Since that incident, White assured his readers that his papers referred to human females as "women," with the exception of [[justice of the peace|police court]] characters, who are all "ladies."  

White's anecdote touches on a phenomenon that others have remarked on as well. In the late [[nineteenth century|nineteenth]] and early [[twentieth century]], in a difference reflected in [[Nancy Mitford]]'s [[U and non-U English|U vs. non-U]] distinction, [[lower class]] women strongly preferred to be called "ladies" while women from higher backgrounds were content to be identified as "women."   [[Alfred Ayers]] remarked in [[1881]] that upper middle class female store clerks in his day were content to be "saleswomen," while lower class female store clerks, for whom their job represented a social advancement, indignantly insisted on being called "salesladies."  Something of this sense may also be underneath [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s lines:

:''The Colonel's lady and Rosie O'Grady &mdash;''
:''Sisters under the skin''

These [[social class]] issues, while no longer on the front burner in the [[twenty-first century]], have imbued the formal use of "lady" with something of an odour of [[irony]] (e.g: "my cleaning lady"). 

It remains in use [[colloquially]]; for example, as a counterpart to "[[gentleman]]," in the phrase "ladies and gentlemen," and is generally interchangeable (in a strictly informal sense) with "woman." (e.g., "The lady at the store said I could return this item in thirty days."). "Ladies" is also the normal text on the signs to any female [[toilet]] in a public place in the UK, again paired with "Gentlemen" (or "Gents").

== More recent usage: sexism (US) ==
[[Non-sexist language]] guidelines forbid its use to refer attributively to the sex of a working person, as in ''lady [[lawyer]]'' and ''lady [[Physician|doctor]]''. Many find these to have a condescending nuance not shared by ''female lawyer'' or ''woman doctor''; compare ''[[poetess]]'' for a similar problem. 

Advocates of non-sexist language recommend not using the word at all, whereas others permit its parallel use in the same circumstances in which a man would be called a gentleman or lord (for example, titling washrooms ''Men'' and ''Ladies'' would be considered sexist, but using either ''Men'' and ''Women'' or ''Ladies'' and ''Gentlemen'' would be acceptable; as is ''landlady'' as the parallel of ''landlord''.)

In the United States, notably among younger [[feminists]] of the [[1990s]] and [[2000s|00s]] influenced by [[riot grrl]], "lady" has occasionally been reclaimed in a more [[irony|ironic]] fashion. For example, [[Miranda July]]'s [[Joanie 4 Jackie]] [[chain letter]] [[videotape]] project is said to consist of "lady-made movies," a feminist music and video [[distributor]] in [[North Carolina]] called itself [[Mr. Lady Records]], and chorus of [[Le Tigre]]'s song "LT Tour Theme" from the album Feminist Sweepstakes (2000) declares itself to be written "for the ladies and the fags."

==More recent usage; a courteous title==
Lady has only been used as the female equivalent of a [[gentleman]], but as a socially acceptable female, the opposite of a [[harlot]] or [[bitch]]. 
<br />It is also referred to towards the end of the Usher song [[Yeah%21_%28Usher_song%29|Yeah!]], in which [[Ludacris]] says we (men) "''want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed.''"  This says that a lady is proper and polite in public.

==Kenny Rogers sings "Lady"== 
"Lady" is also the title of a [[1980]] [[love song]] by [[Kenny Rogers]]. It reached #1 in the US pop charts for 6 weeks and #12 in the UK. It was written by Rogers friend, [[Lionel Richie]] (who also did the song himself). The song appeared on Rogers' 1980 "Greatest Hits" album, which also reached Number 1 in the [[United States]] and sold over 30 million copies world-wide.
