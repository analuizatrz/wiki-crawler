'''Gadsden''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Etowah County, Alabama|Etowah County]], northeastern [[Alabama]], [[United States]], approximately 60 miles northeast of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. It is the principal city of and is included in the [[Gadsden Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. As of the 2005 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city is 37,405.<ref name=popest2>{{cite web | year = [[June 21]] [[2006]] | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/files/SUB-EST2005-04-01.csv | title = Annual Estimates of the Population for All Incorporated Places in Alabama | format = [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] | work = 2005 Population Estimates | publisher = U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division | accessdate = November 9 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

It was at one time the state's 2nd most important industrial center, trailing only [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. The two cities were important shipping centers:  Gadsden for riverboats and Mobile for international trade. Up until the 1980s, Gadsden was almost totally dependent on heavy industry, including [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear Tire]], and [[Republic Steel]]. After virtually crumbling in the 1970s and 1980s, Gadsden decided its best course of action was to stop being dependent on industry, and shedding its "company town" image.

==Double Springs==
The first substantial white settlement in what is now Gadsden was a tiny town called Double Springs.  It was begun by a mixed Indian-white settler named John Riley when he built his house near two springs around 1825.  It became a stagecoach stop on the [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]-to-[[Rome, Georgia|Rome]] route.  The original house still stands today as the oldest house in Gadsden.
The house changed hands to a couple named Gabriel and Asenath Hughes in 1840.  Shortly thereafter, they began to purchase much of the land between [[Lookout Mountain]], the [[Coosa River]], and down to the mouth of Wills Creek.  Their land, plus that of John S. Moragne and Joseph Rhea, became the first part of the city of Gadsden.  Double Springs was transformed on July 4, 1845, when one Captain James Lafferty piloted the first steamboat to the area, aptly named the ''Coosa''.  He landed near the site of the current Memorial Bridge on that date.  The Hughes brothers offered to name the town "Lafferty's Landing" in his honor, but Lafferty declined.  Instead, the name Gadsden was chosen, in honor of Colonel [[James Gadsden]] of [[South Carolina]], famous for the later [[Gadsden Purchase]].

==Gadsden in Recent History==
After the civil rights movement and the closing of most of Gadsden's major industries in the 1970's and 80's, the city began to crash. A 1989 [[Rand McNally]] article listed Gadsden as one of the "Seven Worst Cities to Live in the United States." But due to the forward-looking citizenry of Gadsden, efforts like the Cultural Arts Center and downtown redevelopment earned Gadsden first place in the 2000 City Livability Awards Program<ref>[http://www.usmayors.org/uscm/us_mayor_newspaper/documents/07_31_00/first_article.html "Gadsden Receives First Place in 2000 City Livability Awards Program." ''The United States Conference of Mayors''],however underemployment continues as a very severe problem as indicated by the economic data presented below. Accessed December 9, 2005.</ref>.
