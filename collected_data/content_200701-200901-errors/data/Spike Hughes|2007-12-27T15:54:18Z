'''Patrick "Spike" Cairn Hughes''' ([[1908]]-[[1987]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[jazz]] [[musician]], [[composer]] and [[music journalist]]. He was the son of Irish composer, writer and song collector [[Herbert Hughes (musicologist)|Herbert Hughes]]. Spike was a wonderfully multi-dimensional musician, playing the [[double bass]], composing [[opera]]tic scores, arranging jazz recordings and writing books on topics ranging from [[gardening]] to [[Toscanini]]'s music. 

Hughes' small recording group was one of the earliest artists signed to [[Decca Records]] in England, spanning  the period from [[1929]] to [[1933]], culminating in his visit to [[New York City]] where he arranged 3 historic recording sessions involving members of [[Benny Carter]]'s and [[Luis Russell]]'s bands with [[Coleman Hawkins]] and [[Henry "Red" Allen]] from [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band.  These 14 legendary sides were mostly Hughes' own compositons.  Though not released in the U.S. at the time, they have become known as classic black jazz masterworks.
