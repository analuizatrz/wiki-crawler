The '''Coat of Arms of [[Serbia]]''' was recommended for usage on [[August 17]], [[2004]].<ref>[http://www.parlament.sr.gov.yu/content/cir/o_skupstini/simboli/simboli.asp Official site of Parliament of Serbia]</ref> It is the same as the [[coat of arms]] of the former [[House of Obrenović|Obrenović]] dynasty (first adopted in [[1882]]) and features the white [[bicephalic eagle]] of the [[House of Nemanjić]] (which in turn took on the eagle from the  [[Palaiologos]] dynasty of the [[Byzantine Empire]]). An [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] cape of the style once worn by kings is featured in the background.

==Design==
[[Image:Coat of arms of Serbia small.svg|100px|thumb|Small Coat of Arms of Serbia]]

The principal field stands for the Serbian State. It consists of a double-headed eagle on a red shield; its body and wings in silver, and tongues, beaks, legs and claws in gold, between two golden [[fleurs-de-lys]]. The [[inescutcheon]] stands for the Serbian Nation; in a red shield, a cross between four silver [[firesteel]]s arranged in the quarters around it, all of them facing horizontally outwards.

A [[blazon]] in heraldic terms is: ''Gules, a bicephalic eagle Argent armed Or, two fleurs-de-lys Or. Overall an escutcheon Gules, a cross Argent between four firesteels Argent. All crowned with a royal crown.''
The design on the inescutcheon has been used by Serbian states and the Serbian church since the Middle Ages. The firesteels were originally used in the Byzantine imperial coat of arms as stylized Greek letters ''Β'' and stood for the imperial motto ''Basileus Basileon Basileuon Basileusin'' ("King of kings, ruling over kings") in Greek. That was used by [[House of Mrnjavčević]] in 14th century.

Although Serbia is now a [[republic]], the new coat of arms also features the crown of the former [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian monarchy]]. A crown in this manner usually signifies a monarchial form of government. However in recent years several Eastern European nations have used a crown to signify their royal heritage. [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] have similarly both restored coat of arms bearing crowns despite being republics.

==Political background==
Although it is used as any state insignia, none of the symbols of Serbia adopted on August 17, 2004 are in fact official as per the [[Constitution of Serbia]], as it can be changed only through a 2/3 majority vote in the [[Parliament of Serbia|Parliament]] and a referendum. Since the likelihood of meeting the constitutional referendum criteria was low (as several previous attempts failed in the early 1990s), the government changed the usage rules of the symbols, thus temporarily overriding the constitution, on the grounds of the national consensus that the old and outdated socialist symbols were inappropriate. The current symbols have been put into use by Serbian government's "Recommendation" of August 17 2004, publicized in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, no. 93 of the same date. 

==The fascist coat of arms==
During [[World War II]] a [[Nedić's Serbia|fascist Serbian quisling state]] was formed under general Milan Nedić. It used the [[House of Obrenović]] coat of arms without the royal crown.<ref>http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.co.yu/arhiva/2006/06/08/srpski/T06060703.shtml</ref>

==The socialist coat of arms==

{{main|Coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Serbia}}
After the end of [[World War II]], the new socialist government redesigned the coat of arms, turning it into an example of the arms style used in the [[Soviet Union]] and post-war Eastern Europe. 

The wheat represented peasants and the cogwheel at the bottom represented workers. The red star at the top symbolised communism, the sun with rays represented a new morning. Oak is traditionally a sacred tree for Serbs, hence the oak leaves and acorns.
The years 1804 and 1941 on the red ribbon commemorate the [[First Serbian Uprising]] and the beginning of National liberation struggle against Axis occupiers in the Second World war.

The coat of arms featured a shield with the traditional Serbian emblem, but since the socialist government was officially secular, the cross, which represents [[Christianity]], was omitted. 

The socialist coat of arms remained in official use long after the break-up of socialist Yugoslavia and after the red star was removed from [[flag of Serbia|the flag]].
