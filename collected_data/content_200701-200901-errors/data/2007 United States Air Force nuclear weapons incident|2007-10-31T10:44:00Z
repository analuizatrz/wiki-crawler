The '''2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident''' was an incident at [[Minot Air Force Base]] and [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] on [[August 29]] &ndash; [[August 30|30]], [[2007]] in which six "live" [[AGM-129 ACM]] [[cruise missile]]s (each armed with a [[W80|W80-1]] [[variable yield]] [[nuclear warhead]]) were mistakenly loaded on a [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[B-52H]] [[heavy bomber]] in place of six unarmed AGM-129 missiles that were awaiting transport from Minot to Barksdale for disposal. The live missiles were not reported missing and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for a period of 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions required for nuclear weapons.

==Background==
Minot Air Force Base is the home of the [[5th Bomb Wing]], which according to the USAF's statement on the wing's mission, serves with its B-52 bombers as part of the USAF's conventional and strategic combat force.<ref>USAF, [http://www.minot.af.mil/main/welcome.asp Minot Air Force Base 5th Bomb Wing Mission]</ref>  The "strategic" portion of the 5th's mission consists of the ability to deliver nuclear weapons against potential targets worldwide.  Thus, Minot Air Force Base stores and maintains a ready arsenal of nuclear bombs, nuclear warheads, and associated delivery systems, including, as of August 2007, the AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile.<ref>Warrick, ''Missteps in the Bunker''.</ref>

The AGM-129 was fielded in 1987 as a stealthy cruise missile platform to deliver the W80-3 variable yield nuclear warhead.  Although originally designed to equip the B-1 bomber, it was later decided that the AGM-129 would only be carried by the B-52, mounted on external pylons on the wings.<ref>Parsch, Andreas, [http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-129.html AGM-129]</ref>

In March 2007, the USAF decided to retire its AGM-129 complement.  In order to do so, the USAF began to transport its AGM-129s stored at Minot by B-52s to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana for ultimate disposal.  By [[August 29]], [[2007]] more than 200 AGM-129s had been shipped from Minot to Barksdale in this manner.<ref>Parsch, Andreas, [http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-129.html AGM-129], Warrick, ''Missteps in the Bunker''.</ref>

==Incident==
At 09:12 on [[August 29]], a group of USAF airmen entered one of the weapons storage bunkers at Minot to prepare AGM-129 missiles for transport to Barksdale that day.  That day's scheduled missile transport was to have consisted of 12 AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles, installed with training warheads, with six missiles per [[pylon]] and one pylon mounted under each wing of the B-52 transport aircraft.  When the airmen entered the bunker the missiles were already installed on the underwing pylons and the nuclear warheads in the missiles were supposed to have been already replaced with the dummy training warheads.  In this case, however, six of the missiles still carried nuclear warheads.<ref>Warrick, "Missteps in the Bunker"</ref>

The AGM-129 ACM is a "stealth missile" incorporating a low-observable radar-absorbent paint scheme which prevents use of the traditional colored marking bands or stenciling used to identify different missile "loads", rendering the missiles externally identical. Thus, the only available external method for easily determining the missile's current status is to directly look at the warhead through a postage-stamp sized Plexiglas window on the casing; the normal W80 Mod-1 warhead has a WR (War Reserve) marking and the dummy warhead shows a TR (Training Use Only) marking. (Correctly, only training shape missile have Training Use Only across the side. All live missiles have only US Air Force markings on them. No live missile has a stripe or other marking.)

The maintenance crew and munitions officer that issued the pylon with the nuclear warheads installed did not properly verify that the warheads had been removed and training shapes installed. The transport crew that towed the pylon to the flightline did not verify that training shapes were installed, apparently trusting the crew that issued the pylon. The loading crew that uploaded the pylon to the B-52 aircraft did not verify that training shapes were installed apparently trusting everyone before them.  After taking eight hours to attach the pylons to the aircraft, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without special guard as required for nuclear weapons.<ref>Warrick, "Missteps in the Bunker"</ref>

The flight officer who conducted the next morning's inspection at Minot before takeoff only closely inspected the six missiles on the right wing, which were all properly uploaded with training warheads, before signing the manifest listing the cargo as a dozen unarmed AGM-129 missiles.  Finally, the pilot did not do a final verification check.<ref>Warrick, "Missteps in the Bunker"</ref>

The B-52 departed Minot and landed at Barksdale at 11:23 on [[August 30]].  The aircraft remained parked and without special guard until 20:30, when a munitions team arrived to remove the missiles.  After a member of the munitions crew noticed something unusual about some of the missiles, at 22:00 a "skeptical" supervisor finally determined that nuclear warheads were present and ordered them secured and the incident reported, 36-hours after the missiles were removed from the bunker at Minot.<ref>Warrick, "Missteps in the Bunker"</ref>

The incident was reported to the [[National Military Command Center]] as a [[Bent Spear]] incident, which indicates a nuclear weapon incident that is of significant concern, but does not involve the immediate threat of nuclear war ([[United_States_military_nuclear_incident_terminology|Pinnacle - Nucflash]]) or the accidental detonation of or severe damage to a nuclear weapon ([[Broken Arrow|Pinnacle - Broken Arrow]]). The incident would also not qualify as a [[Empty Quiver|Pinnacle - Empty Quiver]] incident, since the weapons were not technically "lost" at any point, having never left US Air Force custody. The incident was the first of its kind in 40 years in the United States.

== Response from the Pentagon ==

In a [[September 5]] [[2007]] news briefing in the Pentagon by Press Secretary [[Geoff Morrell]], it was stated that at no time the public was in any danger and that military personnel had custody of the weapons at all times.
[[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], General [[T. Michael Moseley]] quickly called the Secretary of Defense on [[August 31st]] to inform him about the incident and the Secretary requested daily updates regarding the investigation.
According to the Press Secretary "...that it's important enough that [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] was notified of it, so it's clearly important." <ref>http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=47320</ref>

On [[September 21]] [[2007]] the York Dispatch reported, that a second, external inquiry was under 
way.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

CNN reported on [[October 19]], [[2007]], that the Pentagon's probe found "...lack of effective leadership and supervision." The report stated that "...a limited number of airmen at both locations failed to follow procedures." Four officers were reportedly relieved of duty, including the Minot wing commander and maintenance crew commander and the Barksdale operational group commander. Additionally, a number of personnel, including the entire 5th Bomb Wing{{Fact|date=October 2007}}, have lost their certification to handle sensitive weaponry.

Maj. Gen. Dick Newton, assistant deputy chief of staff for operations, said the Air Force will refer the matter to a convening authority to determine if additional charges or actions will be taken.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/19/loose.nukes/index.html</ref>

== Nuclear weapons policy ==

In 1968 after several accidents with airborne nuclear weapons, the [[USAF|Air Force]] banned the transport of nuclear weapons by air.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
{{see also|Palomares hydrogen bombs incident}}

== Terminology ==

{{see also|United States military nuclear incident terminology}}

According to the United States nuclear incident terminology, the incident was reported to the National Command Authority as a "Bent Spear" incident, which is less serious than a Pinnacle - Broken Arrow or Pinnacle - Empty Quiver incident. There was no damage to the warheads and they were never actually "lost" by the Empty Quiver definition (having never left US Air Force custody).
