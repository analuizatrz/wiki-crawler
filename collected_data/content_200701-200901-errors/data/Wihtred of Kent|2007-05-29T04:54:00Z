'''Wihtred''' (died [[April 23]], [[725]]) was a King of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] ([[690]] - [[725]]). He was a son of [[Ecgberht of Kent|Ecgberht I]] and a brother of [[Eadric of Kent|Eadric]].

He became king during the period of disorder in Kent that followed the invasion of [[Caedwalla of Wessex]]. [[Oswine of Kent|Oswine]], a king who had been supported by [[Mercia]], lost power in 690, but [[Swæfheard]] (son of [[Sebbi of Essex|Sebbi]], the king of Essex), who had been a king in Kent for a year or two, remained. Wihtred emerged and became king late in 690, apparently ruling alongside Swæfheard. Swæfheard maintained his position until at least [[692]], but by [[694]] Wihtred was the sole ruler of Kent.

It was also in 694 that Wihtred made peace with the [[Wessex|West Saxon]] king [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], which he achieved by paying compensation for the killing of Caedwalla's brother, [[Mul of Kent|Mul]], in [[687]]. Wihtred produced a law code for Kent, which was notable for its generosity toward the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], which was granted freedom from [[taxation]].

On his death, he left Kent to his three sons: [[Æthelbert II of Kent|Æðelberht II]], [[Eadbert I of Kent|Eadberht I]], and [[Alric of Kent|Ælfric]].

One of Wihtred’s charters [http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+15] is dated 17 July 694 in his third year, another 
[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+20] is dated 8 April 699 in Wihtred’s eighth year, and a charter of his son, later Æðelberht II 
[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1180], is dated 11 July 724 in Wihtred’s thirty third year, so Wihtred’s accession fell between 18 July 691 and 8 April 692.
