'''Miranda''' ({{IPA2|mɪˈrændə}}) is the smallest and innermost of [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]]' major [[natural satellite|moon]]s.

It was discovered by [[Gerard Kuiper]] on [[1948-02-16]] at [[McDonald Observatory]]. It is named after [[Prospero]]'s daughter in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]''. The adjectival form of the name is ''Mirandan''<!--- e.g. http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_20.html --->. It is also designated '''Uranus&nbsp;V'''.

So far the only close-up images of Miranda are from the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' probe, which made observations of the moon during its Uranus flyby in January, 1986. During the flyby the southern hemisphere of the moon was pointed towards the [[Sun]] so only that part was studied. It is geologically the most active body in the Uranus system.

==Physical characteristics==

Miranda's surface may be mostly water ice, with the low density body being made of [[silicate]] rock and [[organic compound]]s. Miranda's surface has patchwork regions of broken terrain indicating intense geological activity in the moon's past, and is criss-crossed by huge canyons.

Large grooved structures, called [[coronae]], may be [[diapir]]s, or upwellings of warm ice. They may have changed the density distribution within the moon, which in turn has caused the Miranda to reorient itself,<ref name="Pappalardo">{{cite conference

Another theory, now considered less likely, suggests that a previous incarnation of Miranda was struck by a massive object that shattered the moon soon after its formation. Fragments then resettled into different positions forming the current strange pattern.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Miranda's orbital [[inclination]] (4.34°) is unusually high for a body so close to the planet. At some time in the past, it is possible that it was in a 3:1 [[orbital resonance]] with [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]]. Resulting tidal friction may also have caused warming within the moon and thus be the culprit of the geological activity.<ref>{{cite journal

Scientists recognize the following [[geology|geological]] features on Miranda:
*[[Impact crater|Craters]]
*[[Coronae]] (large [[ovoid]] features)
*[[Regiones]] (geological regions)
*[[Rupes]] ([[Escarpment|scarp]]s)
*[[Sulcus (geology)|Sulci]] (parallel grooves)

==Trivia==
*[[Astronomy Domine]], a song by [[Pink Floyd]], refers  to Miranda as well as Oberon and Titania.
*Miranda is also a planet in the sci-fi movie ''[[Serenity (film)|Serenity]]''.
*Miranda is one of the few bodies in the solar system in which the equator is shorter then the pole-to-pole circumference.
