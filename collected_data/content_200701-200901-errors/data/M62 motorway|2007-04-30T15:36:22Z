The '''M62 motorway''' connects the cities of [[Liverpool]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], in [[England]].  Along the way, it passes the cities of [[Salford]], [[Manchester]], [[Warrington]], [[Bradford, England|Bradford]], [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]], and crosses the [[Pennines|Pennine]] hills.

The [[motorway]] is the most important east-west road in northern England.  Great efforts are made to keep the road clear of [[snow]] in winter months, when other cross-Pennine routes are often shut. The Pennine stretch of motorway is the highest in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] at 1,222 feet (372 metres) above sea level; there is a marker at the highest point. 

The road forms part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|Euroroutes]] [[European route E20|E20]] and [[European route E22|E22]].

== History ==
[[Image:M62 motorway, Calderdale.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The M62 near [[Deanhead Reservoir]] in [[West Yorkshire]]]]
The building of the M62 between [[Rochdale]] and [[Huddersfield]], crossing the Pennines, is considered to have been one of the most daring road construction projects to have taken place in England due to the nature of the terrain. 

On the [[4 February]] [[1974]], 12 people were killed and many more injured in the [[M62 coach bombing]], when the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] exploded a 25lb bomb on board an army coach travelling on the road between Chain Bar, near [[Bradford]], and [[Gildersome]], [[Leeds]] during the night. 

The section of the M62 around Manchester, between junctions 12 and 18, has been renumbered as the [[M60 motorway|M60]] Manchester Outer Ring Road road.  Another section of the orbital road, the Stretford-Eccles Bypass, formerly a section of the M63, was originally built as a section of the M62. At the M62/M60 interchange, a road leads into [[Salford]], called the M602.

In 2003, work commenced on the [[A1 road|A1]], upgrading it to motorway status between [[Doncaster]], and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. The new A1(M) junction opened to traffic on 13 January 2006, intersecting the M62 halfway between J32 (Pontefract) and J33 (Ferrybridge).

In 2007, the UK's first carsharing lane on a motorway is to be built from the [[M606 motorway|M606]] allowing passengers with more than one person in the car a fast track onto the M62 Eastbound at Junction 26, near [[Bradford]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/4822808.stm 'First car-share lane to be built', BBC, 20 March 2006]</ref>

== Stott Hall Farm ==

At the highest point of the motorway, the road divides into two to negotiate the hilly terrain, and Stott Hall Farm, built in [[1737]], is situated in between the two halves.<ref>[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=topn&cat=7 Photographs of the farm, Sabre]</ref>  The farm is located at {{coor dms|53|38|30.19|N|1|57|5.48|W|region:GB_type:landmark}}. The road forks around the farm for engineering reasons. However, a [[Urban legend|myth]] persists that the road had to be split because the owners refused to sell during its construction with some web pages continuing to publish incorrect information.<ref name="BBC Manchester">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/02/02/020207_insideout_farmhouse_feature.shtml 'Farming in the Fast Lane', BBC North West, February 2, 2007]</ref>

The previous tenants, Ken and Beth Wild, lived and worked there since [[1971]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/features/2003/m62.shtml 'Life in the Fast Lane', BBC, May 24, 2002]</ref>  The farm is now occupied by Paul Thorp.<ref name="BBC Manchester">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/02/02/020207_insideout_farmhouse_feature.shtml 'Farming in the Fast Lane', BBC North West, February 2, 2007]</ref>

==Musical mentions==
The M62 is mentioned in the music track "The Snake" from the 2001 album "Secrets" by [[The Human League]] as a possible alternative route between Manchester and Sheffield from the [[Snake Pass]], the main subject of the song. The song lyrics contain the line: "62 or 628 will do if you cannot be late, sometimes the only choice to make in wintertime."  "628" in this context refers to the [[A628 road|A628]], another possible alternative route suggested by the songwriters.

"[[It's Grim Up North]]" by [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] consisted of a list of towns and cities on the M62 in the "grim North", with the slogan "The North will rise again" appearing in the song's video.

The 2002 album ''[[The Last Broadcast (album)|The Last Broadcast]]'' by UK recording artists [[Doves]] includes a track entitled M62 Song.

The song "Driving Away From Home" by UK recording artists "It's Immaterial" poses the tempting question "Why don't we cross the city limits and head on down the M62".

"Man who lives on the M62 (the)" is a song by the [[Graham Fellows|John Shuttleworth]] character (played by Graham Fellows), in which he likens his DIY disasters to the decision to live in the farm between the two carriageways. "I thought it would be alright, but now I can't sleep at night"

==The M62 corridor==

The M62 links most of the professional and semi-professional teams playing [[rugby league]] in the [[Super League (Europe)|Super League]] and [[Rugby League National Leagues|National leagues]], for this reason the phrase 'M62 corridor' is sometimes used as a synonym (often in a derogatory sense) for the rugby league heartlands (see [[Rugby league in England]]).

This is somewhat inaccurate as some cities on the M62 that have teams are not really considered to be in the heartlands whilst West [[Cumbria]] is considered to be part of the heartlands but is not near the M62.  The Super League is also the home of [[Harlequins Rugby League]] (from London) and [[Catalans Dragons|Les Catalans]] (from Perpignan in the south of France.)
