== History ==
[[Image:GM headquarters in Detroit.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Renaissance Center]] in Detroit, Michigan, is General Motors' world headquarters.]]

===Early history===
General Motors was founded on Wednesday, September 16, 1908 in [[Flint, Michigan]], as a holding company for [[Buick]], then controlled by [[William C. Durant]], and acquired [[Oldsmobile]] later that year. The next year, Durant brought in [[Cadillac]], [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore]], [[Oakland automobile|Oakland]] (later known as Pontiac) and several others. In 1909, General Motors acquired the Reliance Motor Truck Company of [[Owosso, Michigan]], and the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of [[Pontiac, Michigan]], the predecessors of [[GMC]] Truck. A Rapid became the first truck to conquer [[Pikes Peak]] in 1909. Durant lost control of GM in 1910 to a bankers trust, because of the large amount of debt taken on in its acquisitions around 1.0 million dollars.

Durant left the firm and helped establish the [[Chevrolet|Chevrolet Motor Company]] in 1911 with brothers Gaston and [[Louis Chevrolet]].  After a brilliant stock buy back campaign, he returned to head GM in 1916, with the backing of [[Pierre S. du Pont]].  Chevrolet entered the General Motors fold in 1917; its first GM car was 1918's Chevrolet 490.  Du Pont removed Durant from management in 1920, and various Du Pont interests held large or controlling share holdings until about 1950.

In 1918 GM purchased the McLaughlin Motor Car Company of [[Oshawa, Ontario]], [[Canada]], manufacturer of the [[McLaughlin automobile|McLaughlin-Buick]] automobile, and renamed it [[General Motors Canada|General Motors of Canada Ltd.]], with [[Samuel McLaughlin|R.S. "Colonel Sam" McLaughlin]] as its first president. 

GM surpassed [[Ford Motor Company]] in the late 1920s thanks to the leadership of [[Alfred Sloan]]. While Ford continued to refine the manufacturing process to reduce cost, Sloan was inventing new ways of managing a complex worldwide organization, while paying special attention to consumer demands. Car buyers no longer wanted the cheapest and most basic model; they wanted style, power, and prestige, which GM offered them. Thanks to consumer financing, easy monthly payments allowed far more people to buy GM cars, while [[Ford]] was moralistically opposed to credit.

===1930s diversification===
During the 1920s and 1930s, General Motors bought control of the [[Yellow Coach]] [[bus]] company, and helped create [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus lines]]. They replaced intercity train transport with buses, and established subsidiary companies to buy out [[streetcar]] companies and replace the rail-based services as well with buses. GM formed [[United Cities Motor Transit]] in 1932 (''see [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy]] for additional details'').

In 1930, GM also began its foray into [[aircraft]] design and manufacturing by buying Fokker Aircraft Corp of America (U.S. subsidiary of [[Fokker]]) and [[Berliner-Joyce Aircraft]], merging them into General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation. Through a stock exchange GM took controlling interest in [[North American Aviation]] and merged it with its General Aviation division in 1933, but retaining the name North American Aviation. In 1948, GM divested NAA as a public company, never to have a major interest in the aircraft manufacturing industry again.

General Motors bought the [[internal combustion engine]]d [[railcar]] builder [[Electro-Motive Corporation]] and its engine supplier [[Winton Motor Carriage Company|Winton Engine]] in 1930, renaming both as the [[General Motors Electro-Motive Division]]. Over the next twenty years, diesel-powered locomotives — the majority built by GM — largely replaced other forms of traction on American railroads. (During [[World War II]], these engines were also important in American [[submarines]] and [[destroyer escorts]].) Electro-Motive was sold in early 2005.

===World War II===
General Motors produced vast quantities of armaments, vehicles and even [[aircraft]] during [[World War II]]. During the war, the U.S. auto companies were concerned that the [[Nazi]]s would nationalize American owned factories in [[Germany]].  In the spring of 1939, the [[Nazi]]s had assumed day to day control of American owned factories in [[Germany]], but decided against nationalizing them.

GM's William P. Knudson served as head of U.S. wartime production for [[President]] [[Franklin Roosevelt]] who had referred to [[Detroit]] as the [[Arsenal of Democracy]]. Today, [[Detroit]] is the headquarters for the U.S. [[Army]] [[Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command]], known as TACOM. 

Nevertheless, while General Motors has claimed that its German operations were outside its control during [[World War II]], this assertion appears to be contradicted by available evidence. General Motors was not just a car company that happened to have factories in [[Germany]]; GM management from the top down had extensive [[Nazi]] connections, both on a business and personal level.<ref>“Trading with the Enemy”, Charles Higham, Doubleday (December 1982).</ref> 

American GM Vice President Graeme K. Howard (later colonel Graeme K. Howard) was a committed [[Nazi]], with such views expressed in his book, ''America and the New World Order''. [[Adolf Hitler]] awarded GM boss James D. Mooney the Order of Merit of the Golden Eagle for his services to [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]. General Motors’ internal documents show a clear strategy to profit from their German military contracts even after the outbreak of war between [[United States|America]] and [[Germany]]. 

Defending the German investment strategy as “highly profitable”, GM’s Alfred P. Sloan told shareholders in 1939 that GM’s continued industrial production for the [[Nazi]] government was merely sound business practice. In a letter to a concerned shareholder, Sloan said that the manner in which the [[Nazi]] government ran [[Germany]] "should not be considered the business of the management of General Motors...We must conduct ourselves as a German organization. . . We have no right to shut down the plant."<ref>[[Ford]] and GM Scrutinized for Alleged Nazi Collaboration, [[Washington Post]], Monday, [[November 30]], [[1998]]; Page A0.</ref>

After 20 years of researching General Motors, Bradford Snell stated that: "General Motors was far more important to the [[Nazi]] war machine than [[Switzerland]] ... [[Switzerland]] was just a repository of looted funds. GM was an integral part of the German war effort. The Nazis could have invaded [[Poland]] and [[Russia]] without [[Switzerland]]. They could not have done so without GM.”<ref>Ibid.</ref>

===Post-war growth===
At one point GM had become the largest corporation registered in the [[United States]], in terms of its revenues as a percent of [[GDP]].  In 1953, [[Charles Erwin Wilson]], then GM president, was named by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. When he was asked during the hearings before the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] if as secretary of defense he could make a decision adverse to the interests of General Motors, Wilson answered affirmatively but added that he could not conceive of such a situation "because for years I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa". Later this statement was often misquoted, suggesting that Wilson had said simply, "What's good for General Motors is good for the country." At the time, GM was one of the largest employers in the world – only Soviet state industries employed more people.  On [[December 31]], [[1955]], General Motors became the first American corporation to make over one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[US dollar|dollars]] in a year.

===Recent history===
After   GM's massive lay-offs hit [[Flint, Michigan]], a [[Strike action|strike]] began at the General Motors parts factory in Flint on [[June 5]], [[1998]], which quickly spread to five other assembly plants and lasted seven weeks. Because of the significant role GM plays in the United States, the strikes and temporary idling of many plants noticeably showed in national economic observations.

In the late 1990s, GM had regained market share; its stock had soared to over $80 a share by 2000.  However, in 2001, the stock market drop following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], combined with historic pension underfunding, caused a severe pension and benefit fund crisis at GM and many other American companies and the value of their pension funds plummeted. A weak U.S. dollar and private health care (as opposed to nationalized health care in other countries) costs also put GM at a disadvantage to its Japanese, Korean, and European counterparts. In successive moves, GM responded to the crisis by fully funding its pension fund; however, its Other Post Employment Benefits Fund (OPEB) became a serious issue resulting in downgrades to its bond rating in 2005. The company expressed its disagreement with these bond rating downgrades. In 2006, GM responded by offering buyouts to hourly workers to reduce future liability; over 35,000 workers responded to the offer, well exceeding the company's goal. GM has gained higher rates of return on its benefit funds as a part of the solution. Stock value has begun to rebound - as of [[October 30]], [[2006]] GM's [[market capitalization]] was about $19.19 billion. GM stock began the year [[2006]] at $19 a share, near its lowest level since 1982, as many on [[Wall Street]] figured the ailing automaker was bound for [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy court]]. But GM is still afloat. The company's stock in the [[Dow Jones]] industrial average has posted the biggest percentage gain in 2006.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/investing/bal-bz.petruno26dec26,0,3755461.story?track=rss 2006 takes a soft bounce] By Tom Petruno, [[The Baltimore Sun]], Tuesday, [[December 26]], [[2006]]</ref> 

Since [[2000]], GM has remained the world's largest auto maker, ranked according to sales.
====Renault-Nissan proposal====
On [[June 30]], [[2006]], [[Kirk Kerkorian]], whose [[Tracinda Corporation]] was the third-largest shareholder of General Motors, proposed a failed deal for an alliance between GM and Renault & Nissan. [[Tracinda]] has since sold off its interest in General Motors.

Recent news media have uncovered a proposed plan in which GM would purchase most, if not all of the Chrysler Group from DaimlerChrysler. Various plans have been proposed, including a large cash payment or a stock trade between GM and DCX.

===Electronic Data Systems Corporation===

[[image:Logo eds.gif|thumb|EDS logo]] 

{{main|Electronic Data Systems}}
In 1984, GM acquired [[Electronic Data Systems Corporation]] (EDS), a leading data processing and telecommunications company, to be the sole provider of information technology services for the company. EDS became independent again in 1996, signing a 10-year agreement to continue providing IT services to General Motors. <ref>[http://www.eds.com/news/features/2828/ EDS and General Motors Relationship Spans More Than Two Decades. EDS. Feb 2, 2006, retrieved March 18, 2007]</ref>

===Hughes Electronics Corporation ===
[[Image:Hughes_Electronics.gif|thumb|Hughes logo, adopted after its new owner General Motors]]

{{main|Hughes Aircraft}}
Hughes Electronics was formed in 1985 when [[Hughes Aircraft]] was sold by the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] to GM for $5.2 billion. GM merged Hughes Aircraft with its [[Delco Electronics]] unit to form Hughes Electronics. This division was a major aerospace and defense contractor, civilian space systems manufacturer and communications company. The aerospace and defense business was sold to [[Raytheon]] in 1997 and the Space and Communications division was sold to [[Boeing]] in 2000. [[Hughes Research Laboratories]] became jointly owned by GM, Raytheon, and Boeing. In 2003, the remaining parts of Hughes Electronics was sold to [[News Corporation]] and renamed [[DirecTV Group]].

== Auto racing ==

General Motors has an extensive history in numerous forms of racing. Vehicles of most, if not all, of GM's brands have been represented in competition, with perhaps [[Chevrolet]] being the most prominent.  In particular, the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] has long been popular and successful in international road racing. GM also is a supplier of racing components, such as engines, transmissions, and electronics.
GM's [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] engine platform was successful in open-wheel Indy-style racing throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small [[V8 engine|V-8]] class.  An unmodified Aurora V-8 in the Aerotech, captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the [[Cadillac V-Series]] has entered motorsports racing.  GM has also used many cars in the American racing series [[NASCAR]].  Currently the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] is the only entry in the series but in the past the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Buick Regal]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Chevrolet Lumina]] and [[Chevrolet Malibu]] were also used. Starting in March 2007, the [[Chevrolet Impala]] will be phased into the series.

In touring cars (mainly in Europe) [[Vauxhall]] is a key player and former champion in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC) series and competes with a [[Vauxhall Astra|Vauxhall Astra VXR]] in BTC spec. [[Opel]] is one of the three participants in the [[DTM]] series (along with [[Audi]] and [[Mercedes Benz]]) and is a former champion and competes with a unique 500 [[horse power|bhp]] vehicle that resmbles the [[Opel Vectra]]. [[Chevrolet]] competes with a [[Chevrolet Lacetti|Lacetti]] in the [[FIA]] [[World Touring Car Championship]] (WTCC).

In [[Australia]], there is the prestigious V8 Supercar Championship which is battled out by the two main rivals of [[Holden]]& [[Ford]]. The current [[Holden]] Racing Team cars are based on the [[Holden Commodore]] and run a 5.0-litre V8-cylinder engine producing 600+BHP (approx 500Kw Power) @ 7500rpm). These cars have a top speed of 300+km/h (185mph) and run 0-100km/h in less than 4 seconds. The [[Holden Racing Team]] is Australia's most successful team in Australian Touring Car History. In 2006 both the Teams and Drivers championship was won by the very closely linked [[Toll HSV Dealer Team]]

== Corporate issues ==
=== Social policies ===
General Motors was named one of the 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers in 2004 by ''Working Mothers'' magazine.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} GM has also given millions of dollars in computers to colleges of Engineering through its PACE Awards program.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

=== Environment and alternative vehicles ===
General Motors has long worked on alternative-technology vehicles, and has recently led the industry with clean burning Flex Fuel vehicles that can run on either E-85 (ethanol) or [[gasoline]]. The company was the first to use [[turbocharger]]s and was an early proponent of [[V6]] engines in the 1960s, but quickly lost interest as the [[muscle car]] race took hold. They demonstrated [http://www.conklinsystems.com/firebird/mlife.php] [[gas turbine]] vehicles powered by [[kerosene]], an area of interest throughout the industry in the late 1950s, but despite extensive thermal recycling (developed by Chrysler) the fuel consumption was too high and starting torque too low for everyday use. They were also an early licensee of [[Wankel engine]] technology, even developing the [[Chevrolet Monza]] around the powerplant, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, GM pushed the benefits of [[diesel]] engines and [[cylinder deactivation]] technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the [[Oldsmobile]] diesels  and drivability issues in the [[Cadillac]] 4-6-8 variable cylinder engines. In 1987 GM, in conjunction with [[Aerovironment]] built the [[Sunraycer]] which won the inaugural [[World Solar Challenge]] and was a showcase of advanced technology.  Much of the technology from [[Sunraycer]] found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by [[Aerovironment]] and was the predecessor to the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]].

In 1996, GM introduced the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]], the first modern mass-produced [[electric car]], which was available by lease only (see below: [[General Motors#Controversy over electric vehicles|Controversy over EV1]]). Despite the positive publicity generated by this vehicle and a long waiting list for the cars, the company cancelled the program after only a tiny production run, reportedly due to a "lack of consumer interest".  GM forced the return of EV1 vehicles even though some owners wanted to keep them. The story of GM's non-support for its own product is portrayed in the 2006 documentary, [[Who killed the electric car?]].  The EV1 lived on in the powertrain of the S10 factory built electric vehicle assembled in Shreveport, Louisiana by General Motors.  The electric motor had slightly decreased horsepower from the EV1 it was borrowed from because it was not as aerodynamic as the EV1 and so traded horsepower for range. See [http://www.seattleeva.org/wiki/Chevrolet_S10_EV here] for more information.

==== Hybrid initiative ====
In May 2004, GM delivered the world's first full sized hybrid pickups, and introduced a hybrid passenger car.  In 2005, the [[Opel Astra]] [[diesel]] [[hybrid vehicle|Hybrid]] [[concept vehicle]] was introduced. The [[2006]] [[Saturn VUE|Saturn VUE Green Line]] was the first hybrid passenger vehicle from GM and is also a mild design. GM has hinted at new hybrid technologies to be employed that will be optimized for higher speeds in [[freeway]] driving. Future hybrid vehicles should include the 2007 [[GMC Yukon]], the [[Saturn Aura]] and an updated [[Saturn VUE]] based an [[Opel]] design like the [[Saturn Aura]].  GM has recently introduced the concept Chevrolet Volt which is a plug-in hybrid.

GM’s current hybrid models:

There is a GM hybrid powered bus: GM Magic Bus<ref>http://www.gm.com/company/gmability/adv_tech/300_hybrids/index_bus.html </ref>

====Hydrogen initiative ====
GM has prided its research and prototype development of [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen powered vehicles]], to be produced in early 2010, using a support infrastructure still in a prototype state.  The economic feasibility of the technically challenging hydrogen car, and the low-cost production of hydrogen to fuel it, has also been discussed by other automobile manufacturers such as Ford and Chrysler.

===Marketing===
At one time, each of GM's automotive divisions were targeted to specific market segments and despite some shared components, each distinguished itself from its stablemates with unique styling and technology. The shared components and common corporate management created substantial [[economy of scale|economies of scale]], while the distinctions between the divisions created an orderly upgrade path, with an entry-level buyer starting out with a practical and economical [[Chevrolet]] and moving through offerings of the different divisions until the purchase of a [[Cadillac]]. The divisions were not [[competition|competing]] with each other as much as passing along the same customer who would thus always be buying a GM product.

The postwar automobile industry became enamored with the concept of "[[planned obsolescence]]", implemented by both technical and styling innovations with a typical 3-year product cycle. In this cycle, a new basic body shell is introduced and then modified for the next two years with minor styling changes. GM, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] competed vigorously in this new restyling environment.

By 1958, the divisional distinctions within GM began to blur with the availability of high-performance engines in [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Pontiac]]s. The introduction of higher trim models such as the [[Chevrolet Impala]] and [[Pontiac Bonneville]] priced in line with some [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Buick]] offerings was also confusing to consumers. By the time [[Pontiac]], [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Buick]] introduced similarly styled and priced compact models in 1961, the old "step-up" structure between the divisions was nearly over.

The 1960s saw the creation of compact and intermediate classes. The [[Chevrolet Corvair]] was a 6-cylinder answer to the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], the Chevy II was created to match Ford's conventional [[Ford Falcon|Falcon]] and the [[Chevrolet Camaro]]/[[Pontiac Firebird]] was GMs counter measure to the [[Ford Mustang]]. Among intermediates, the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] nameplate became so popular during the 1970s that [[Oldsmobile]] applied the Cutlass name to most of its products in the 1980s. By the mid 1960s, most of GM's vehicles were built on a few common ''platforms'' and in the 1970s GM began to use nearly identical body panel stampings, differing only in internal and external trim items. 

The [[1971]] [[Chevrolet Vega]] was GMs launch into the new subcompact class. Problems associated with its innovative [[aluminum]] engines would damage GMs reputation more than perhaps any other vehicle in its history. During the late 1970s, GM would initiate a wave of [[downsizing]] starting with the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] which was reborn into what was the size of the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], the Malibu would be the size of the Nova, and the Nova was replaced by the troubled front-wheel drive Citation.

By the 1980s, GM frequently "rebadged" one division's successful vehicle into several models across the divisions, all positioned close to one another in the market place. Thus a new GM model's main competition might be another model spawned off the same platform. This led to market "[[Cannibal#Other uses of the word|cannibalization]]" with the divisions spending time stealing sales from one another. Even today, the company's GMT360 mid-sized light truck platform has spawned the basic [[Chevrolet Trailblazer]], [[Oldsmobile Bravada]], [[GMC Envoy]], [[Isuzu Ascender]], [[Buick Rainier]] and [[Saab 9-7X]]. Though each model had a more or less unique mission, the trucks can hardly be discerned from one another. 

In the late 1990s, the U.S. economy was on the rise and GM and [[Ford]] gained market share producing enormous profits primarily from the sale of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles.  From 2000 to 2001, the [[Federal Reserve]] in a move to quell the stock market, made twelve successive interest rate increases. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], a severe stock market decline magnified the effect of GM's history pension and benefit fund underfunding, precipitating a crisis.  At the same time, this crisis happened at other U.S. companies with similar histories, such as [[Ford]], [[DaimlerChrysler]], and [[United Airlines]].  GM began its ''Keep America Rolling'' campaign, which boosted sales, and other auto makers were forced to follow suit. The U.S. automakers saw gross margins deteriorate.

In 2004, GM redirected resources from the development of new sedans to an accelerated refurbishment of their light trucks and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s for introduction as 2007 models in early 2006. Shortly after this decision, fuel prices increased by over 50% and this in turn affected both the trade-in value of used vehicles and the perceived desirability of new offerings in these market segments. The current marketing plan to extensively tout these revised vehicles as offering the best fuel economy ''in their class'' (of vehicle). GM claims its hybrid trucks will have gas-mileage improvements of 25%, besting the current fuel-economy leaders, [[Toyota]] and [[Honda]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In the summer of 2005, GM announced that its corporate chrome emblem "[[Mark of Excellence]]" will begin appearing on all recently introduced and all-new 2006 model vehicles produced and sold in North America. The move is seen as an attempt by GM to link its name and vehicle brands more closely. 

In 2005, GM promoted sales through an employee discount to all buyers. Marketed as the lowest possible price, GM cleared an inventory buildup of 2005 models to make way for its 2006 lineup. While the promotion was a temporary shot in the arm for sales, it did not help the company's bottom line. GM has since changed its marketing strategy to a no haggle sticker policy in which all vehicle proces are lowered, but incentives are reduced, if not eliminated.

=== Economics ===
In March 2005, the [[Government of Canada]] provided [[Canadian dollar|C$]]200 million in incentives to General Motors for its Ontario plants, and last fall it provided C$100 million to [[Ford Motor Co.]] to expand production and provide jobs, according to [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]]. Similar incentives were promised to non-North American auto companies like Toyota, Premier Dalton McGuinty said the money the province and Ottawa are pledging for the project is well-spent. His government has committed [[Canadian dollar|C$]]400 million, including the latest Toyota package of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]125 million, to the province's automobile sector, which helped finance $5 billion worth of industry projects.

For the first time, in 2004 the total number of cars produced by all makers in [[Ontario]] exceeded those produced in [[Michigan]].

For the first time in 2004 GM sold more vehicles in other countries than inside the US.

=== GM in China ===
General Motors is the second best selling foreign auto maker in [[China]] after [[Volkswagen]], operating under the name of "Shanghai GM", with a 12.5% market there. The [[Buick]] brand is especially strong, led by the [[Buick Excelle]] subcompact. [[Cadillac]] initiated sales in [[China]] in 2004, starting with imports from the [[United States]]. GM pushed the marketing of the [[Chevrolet]] brand in [[China]] in 2005 as well, moving the former [[Buick Sail]] to that marque. The company manufactures most of its China-market vehicles locally, through its [[Shanghai GM]] joint venture. The [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile]] joint-venture is also successful selling trucks and vans under the [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile|Wuling]] marque.

=== Corporate restructuring ===
After gaining market share in the late 1990s and making enormous profits General Motors stock soared to over $80 a share. However, in 2000, twelve successive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to quell the stock market, and a severe stock market decline following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], caused a pension and benefit funds crisis at General Motors and many other American companies. General Motor's rising retiree health care costs and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) fund deficit prompted the company to enact a broad restructuring plan.  Although GM had already taken action to fully fund its pension plan, its OPEB fund became an issue for its corporate bond ratings. GM had expressed its disagreement with the bond ratings; moveover, GM's benefit funds were performing at higher than expected rates of return.  Then, following a $10.6 billion loss in 2005, GM acted quickly to implement its restructuring plan. For the first quarter of 2006 GM earned $400 million, signaling a turnaround had already begun even though many aspects of the restructuring plan had not yet taken effect.

In February 2005, GM successfully bought itself out of a put option with [[Fiat]] for $2 billion USD (€1.55 billion). In 2000, GM had sold a 6% stake to [[Fiat]] in return for a 20% share in the Italian automaker. As part of the deal, GM granted [[Fiat]] a [[put option]] which, if exercised between January 2004 and July 2009, could have forced GM to buy [[Fiat]]. GM had agreed to the put option at the time, perhaps to keep it from being acquired by another automaker such as [[DaimlerChrysler]] competing with GM's [[Opel]] and [[Vauxhall]] marques.  The relationship suffered, and [[Fiat]] had failed to improve. In 2003, [[Fiat]] recapitalized, reducing GM's stake to 10%. 

In February 2006, GM slashed its annual dividend from 2.00 to $1.00 per share. The reduction saved $565 million a year. 

In March 2006, GM divested 92.36 million shares (reducing their stake from 20% to 3%) of Japanese manufacturer [[Suzuki]], in order to raise $2.3 billion. GM originally invested in [[Suzuki]] in the early 1980s. 

On [[March 23]], a private equity consortium including [[KKR]], [[Goldman Sachs Capital]], and [[Five Mile Capital]] purchased $8.8 billion, or 78% of [[GMAC]], GM's commercial mortgage arm. 
The new entity, in which GMAC will own a 21% stake, will be known as Capmark Financial Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060323/NEWS11/60323002|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|title=article|accessdate=March 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On [[April 3]], [[2006]], GM announced that it would sell 51% of [[GMAC]] as a whole to a consortium led by [[Cerberus Capital Management]], raising $14 billion over 3 years.  Investors also include [[Citigroup]]'s private equity arm and [[Aozora Bank]] of [[Japan]].  The group will pay GM $7.4 billion in cash at closing.  GM will retain approximately $20 billion in automobile financing worth an estimated $4 billion over three years.

GM sold its 8% stake in [[Isuzu]] on [[April 11]], [[2006]], to raise an additional $300 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060411/UPDATE/604110423/1148/AUTO01|title=GM sells Isuzu shares for $300 million|work=[[Detroit News]]|accessdate=April 12|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On [[June 26]], [[2006]], 35,000 GM workers had agreed to company buyouts, well over the company goal significantly reducing GM's operating costs and future liability. 12,600 workers from [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]], a key supplier to GM, agreed to buyouts and an early retirement plan offered by GM in order to avoid a strike, after a judge agreed to cancel Delphi's union contracts. 5,000 Delphi workers were allowed to flow to GM.

== Controversy over electric vehicles ==
[[Image:evcrushed.jpg|left|thumb|300px|EV1s crushed by General Motors]]

On [[June 30]], [[2006]] a documentary about the demise of the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]] and other electric vehicles entitled "[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]" debuted in theatres across America, sparking criticism of the motivation behind the cancellation of their electric car program.

Consumer advocates, activists, commentators, journalists, and documentary makers claim GM had deliberately [[Sabotage|sabotaged]] their company's zero emission electric vehicle efforts through several methods: failing to market, failing to produce appropriate vehicles, failing to satisfy demand, and using lease-only programs with prohibitions against end of lease purchase.[http://dontcrush.com]
[http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/223/index.html#here]
[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/11/eveningnews/main543605.shtml]
[http://ev1.org/#vigilog]
[http://dontcrush.com/]

The process of obtaining GM's first electric vehicle the EV1 was difficult. The vehicle could not be purchased outright. Instead, General Motors offered a closed-end lease for three years, with no renewal or residual purchase options.   The EV1 was only available from specialist Saturn dealerships, and only in California and Arizona.[http://www.answers.com/topic/general-motors-ev1] Before reviewing leasing options, a potential lessee would be taken through a 'pre-qualification' process in order to learn how the EV1 was different from other vehicles. Next came a waiting list with no scheduled delivery date.[http://pages.prodigy.net/noela/myev.htm]

Several weeks before the debut of the movie, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] announced that its EV1 display was being permanently removed and the EV1 car put into storage. GM is a major financial contributor to the museum, and both parties denied that this fact contributed to the removal of the display.[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060711/AUTO01/607110368/1148]



===From General Motors===
General Motors has responded to complaints about the scrapping of the EV1 program and they dispute the existence of any conspiracy surrounding its demise.  An entry was posted on the [http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fastlane_Blog.html GM FastLane Blog] in 2006 in which GM defended its decision by saying that it was unable to guarantee the vehicles could continue to be maintained in a safe operating state. [http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fastlane_Blog.html#EV1]  

GM allege that during the four years available to the public, only 800 EV1's were released. Over $1 billion was spent on the EV1 program, with a great portion used for consumer incentives and marketing. With a waiting list of 5,000 applicants, only 50 individuals actually were willing to accept a lease on the EV1. Suppliers ceased production of replacement parts due to the low demand for the EV1.  This made repairs and continued safety of the vehicles difficult. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

General Motors (GM) has responded to allegations made in the film through a blog post entitled [http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html ''Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?''] by Dave Barthmuss of their communications department.  He does not address the movie directly, since he claims he has not seen it, but tells GM's side of the story

<blockquote>Sadly, despite the substantial investment of money and the enthusiastic fervor of a relatively small number of EV1 drivers — including the filmmaker — the EV1 proved far from a viable commercial success.</blockquote>

Barthmuss notes investments in electric vehicle technology since the EV1: [[Two-Mode Hybrid]], plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicle programs.  The filmmakers suggested that GM did not immediately channel its technological progress with the EV1 into these projects, and instead let the technology languish while focusing on more immediately profitable enterprises such as SUVs.

Unlike the movie, GM is bullish on hydrogen, according to Barthmuss:

<blockquote>Although hydrogen fuel cell technology was cast as a pie-in-the-sky technology by the moviemakers, GM is making great progress in fuel cell research and development and is on track to achieving its goal to validate and design a fuel cell propulsion system by 2010 that is competitive with current combustion systems on durability and performance, and that ultimately can be built at scale, affordably.</blockquote>

According to GM, not all of the EV1's were destroyed.  Many were donated to research institutions and facilities, along with museums. Some are still owned by General Motors themselves, and are kept at their Technical Design center in [[Warren, Michigan]], and can occasionally be seen on the road within a close area of the tech center. [http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fastlane_Blog.html#EV1]

There is no other '''major''' automaker on the road offering a fully electric vehicle designed for everyday use on public transportation routes, [http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fastlane_Blog.html#EV1] however [[Think_Nordic]], at one time under the ownership of Ford, have produced a range of electric vehicles in limited numbers.
