'''James Jesse Strang''' ([[March 21]] [[1813]] &ndash; [[July 9]] [[1856]]) was [[baptised]] as a member of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] on [[February 24]] [[1844]] in [[Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]]. A few months after the murder of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] he was [[excommunicated]] and established a religious [[sect]] of his own where he taught that the new gathering place for the [[Latter Day Saint]]s would be in [[Wisconsin]] and that he was to be their king. 

After [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], founder of the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints" was murdered, there were several claimants to his role as leader and prophet of the church. Eventually, [[Brigham Young]] as the head of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] led the majority of Latter-day saints to [[Utah]]. Although Strang was a recent convert to the fourteen year-old church, several prominent Mormons, including some of Smith's family, accepted Strang's claims for a period.

Strang's group was formally called the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (notice, no [[hyphen]] and the different capitalization) but Strang's church and his followers were commonly called the "Strangites". The church has its headquarters in [[Voree, Wisconsin]], where Strang is buried.

Strang and his associates settled for several years on [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]] in [[Lake Michigan]], where he was  pronounced [[monarch|king]]. Strang was also a [[lawyer]], land developer, [[news]] correspondent for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', and a scientist for the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

==Childhood and education==
James Jesse Strang was born [[March 21]] [[1813]], the middle of three children, in [[Scipio, New York|Town of Scipio]], [[Cayuga County, New York]]. He was raised as a [[Baptist]] by parents who had a good reputation. James' mother was very tender with him as a consequence of delicate health. She required him to render an account of all his actions and words while absent from her. Born Jesse James Strang, he later changed the order of his first and middle name, as he aspired to the greatness of a King and King James sounded better than King Jesse to him.

At 12 years old, Strang was baptised as a Baptist. He was known as an exceptionally intelligent child, "a dreamer of grandiose dreams&mdash;dreams of power, of royalty, and of fame" according to one biographer. He studied civil law, and was admitted to the bar in New York and other places where he resided. He became County [[Postmaster]]. 

He became a Baptist [[minister of religion|minister]], but joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in 1844. Strang quickly came into favor with Joseph Smith, though they'd known each other only a few months.

==Succession as prophet==
Following Smith's murder, [[Brigham Young]], Strang, and several others claimed to be Smith's successor. A power struggle ensued, and Young eventually led the bulk of Smith's followers to [[Utah]]. 

Strang's evidence for his leadership claim included a "[[Letter of Appointment (Mormonism)|Letter of Appointment]]" from Smith, postmarked a week before his death: "[[Nauvoo]], [[June 19]], [[1844]]." Strang also testified that an [[angel]] appointed him as Smith's successor at about the same time Smith died; Smith and Strang were some 200 miles (320 km) apart at the time, and some witnesses reported that Strang made his announcement before news of Smith's murder was publicly available. 

The letter from Smith to Strang is held at [[Yale University]]. Although the [[postmark]] and first page are legitimate, forensic analysis{{Fact|date=February 2007}} shows the second page&mdash;the one with text appointing Strang as Smith's successor&mdash;is of a different paper stock than the first page, suggesting it may have been [[Forgery|forged]]. 

The letter convinced most of Smith's family and several other prominent Mormons that Strang's claims were genuine. [[John Whitmer]], [[David Whitmer]], [[Martin Harris]], [[Hiram Page]], [[John E. Page]], [[William E. McLellin]], [[William Smith (Mormonism)|William Smith]], Smith's first wife and widow, [[Emma Hale Smith]], the sisters of Joseph Smith, [[William Marks (Mormonism)|William Marks]], [[George Miller]], and others, including Joseph Smith's mother, [[Lucy Mack Smith]]. Lucy wrote to [[Reuben Hedlock]]: "I am satisfied that Joseph appointed J.J. Strang. It is verily so."(ibid) According to William Smith, all of Joseph Smith's family (except for [[Hyrum Smith]]'s and [[Samuel Harrison Smith]]'s widows), endorsed Strang; (Palmer, 211)

In all, about 12,000 Latter-day saints accepted Strang's claims. A smaller group followed him to [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]] in [[Lake Michigan]].

Most of his initial followers, including those listed above, would leave Strang's church before his death. Some eventually followed [[Brigham Young]], but Smith's immediate family never recognized Young's leadership as legitimate, and many of them formed the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] a few years later.

Strang led his church for 12 years.

==Visions, translating from plates, and revelations==
Like Joseph Smith, Strang reported numerous visions, unearthed and translated ancient metal [[Voree Plates|plates]] using [[Urim and Thummim]], and also like Smith, Strang had eleven witnesses authenticate their genuineness.

Unlike Smith, however, Strang offered his plates to the curious public for examination. C. Lantham Sholes of the "Southport Telegraph" examined the plates and the area they were said to have been uncovered. Sholes offered no opinion of the metal plates, but described Strang as "honest and earnest" and opined that Strang's followers ranked "among the most honest and intelligent men in the neighborhood."<ref>Palmer, 209.</ref>

Strang's translation of the metal plates was transcribed by Samuel Graham, and published as ''[[Book of the Law of the Lord]]'', said to be the original law as it was given to [[Moses]]. 

Strang also translated other items, including a small plate unearthed according to directions given in a vision, and the [[Plates of Laban]] described in the [[Book of Mormon]]. He said he received a number of revelations, including his own appointment as king and continuing the [[plural marriage]] established by Smith.

==Coronation as king==
Strang was to fulfill the office of [[monarch|king]] as described in the Book of the Law of the Lord. He was crowned in [[1850]] by his counselor [[George J. Adams]]. About 300 people witnessed his inauguration to which he wore a red flannel robe with a white collar with black speckles. He also wore a tin crown, a breast plate and carried a shield and a wood scepter. He ruled for several years. He had five wives.

As a result of his coronation, Strang was accused of [[treason]], and was brought to trial in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. His trial defense brought him considerable favorable press, which he leveraged to run for, and win, a seat on the Michigan state legislature in [[1853]]. He was reelected to that office in [[1855]].

==Assassination==
On [[June 20]] [[1856]], Strang was gunned down in front of the general store by two men. After he was shot others joined in and beat him. Many that had been members of his church had become disgruntled on account of his demand that tithing be paid to him; if a full tithe was not believed to have been paid then missionaries were sent out to the members' homes for it. The men who shot him escaped on board the [[USS Michigan (sidewheel)|USS ''Michigan'']]. Several witnesses on board the ship did nothing to help Strang, who was wounded twice in the head, and once in the ribs. He lived until [[July 9]], when he died, aged 43.

==After Strang's death==
Most of the members later joined the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ]], which was established four years after Strang's death.
