'''Tropical Storm Ana''' was the only [[tropical cyclone]] on record in the [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic basin]] during the month of April. The first tropical cyclone of the season, it developed as a [[subtropical cyclone]] from a non-tropical [[low pressure area|low]] on [[April 20]] to the west of [[Bermuda]]. It tracked east-southeastward and organized, and on [[April 21]] it transitioned into a tropical cyclone with peak winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h). Tropical Storm Ana turned east-northeastward, steadily weakening due to wind shear and an approaching [[cold front]], and on [[April 24]] it became an [[extratropical cyclone]]. The storm brushed Bermuda with light rain, and the remnants produced precipitation in the [[Azores]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Swells generated by the storm capsized a boat along the [[Florida]] coastline, causing two fatalities.

A non-tropical [[low pressure area]] developed about 240&nbsp;miles (390&nbsp;km) south-southwest of [[Bermuda]] on [[April 18]] through the interaction of an upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] and a surface frontal [[trough (meteorology)|trough]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Ana Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-14|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003ana.shtml?}}</ref> The surface trough, which extended from the gale center to [[Hispaniola]], brought a plume of moisture northward from the [[Caribbean Sea]] into the circulation, which caused heavy rainfall in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mike Tichacek|year=2003|title=April 18 Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-14|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Atl-Dis/2003/Apr/2003041804.AXNT20}}</ref> The non-tropical low tracked generally northward,<ref name="tcr"/> with a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its east and west,<ref>{{cite web|author=Robbie Berg|year=2003|title=April 19 Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-14|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Atl-Dis/2003/Apr/2003041917.AXNT20}}</ref> and on [[April 19]] the system began producing sporadic convection near its center; early that day, satellite imagery indicated the presence of a tight inner core of winds. After turning to the northwest, it looped southeastward and gradually became separated from the surface frontal system,<ref name="tcr"/> due to the deepening of the upper-level trough over the system.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robbie Berg|year=2003|title=April 20 Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-14|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Atl-Dis/2003/Apr/2003042017.AXNT20}}</ref> Convection became better organized over the center, and it is estimated the system developed into Subtropical Storm Ana early on [[April 20]] while located about 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) west of Bermuda.<ref name="tcr"/> Operationally, the [[subtropical cyclone]] was not classified by the [[National Hurricane Center]] until 21&nbsp;hours later.<ref name="disc1">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2003|title=Subtropical Storm Ana Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-14|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al012003.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref>

The subtropical storm tracked east-southeastward and continued to organize, and by late on [[April 20]] an upper-level warm core was present over the system. Based on its organization, Ana is estimated to have become a tropical storm by 0000&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on [[April 21]]. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Ana attained a peak intensity of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h), which was based on estimates from the [[Hebert-Poteat technique]] and data from [[QuikSCAT]]. Shortly thereafter, it made its closest point of approach to Bermuda, when it passed about 130&nbsp;miles (210&nbsp;km) southwest of the island.<ref name="tcr"/> Operationally, the cyclone was first classified by the National Hurricane Center around this time, when it was considered a subtropical cyclone.<ref name="disc1"/> Strong upper-level [[wind shear]] removed much of the convection,<ref name="disc2">{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch|year=2003|title=Subtropical Storm Ana Discussion Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al012003.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> though a small area of thunderstorms persisted near the center.<ref name="disc3">{{cite web|author=Miles Lawrence|year=2003|title=Subtropical Storm Ana Discussion Three|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al012003.discus.003.shtml?}}</ref> The storm became completely separated from the upper-level system,<ref name="disc4">{{cite web|author=Miles Lawrence|year=2003|title=Subtropical Storm Ana Discussion Four|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al012003.discus.004.shtml?}}</ref> and the cyclone re-organized, developing an [[eye (cyclone)|eye feature]] late on [[April 21]].

The extratropical storm accelerated east-northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on [[April 27]] southeast of the [[Azores]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Prior to the development of Ana, the government of [[Bermuda]] issued a gale warning for the island.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2003|title=April 20 Special Tropical Disturbance Statement|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Disturbance/2003/Apr/2003042022.WONT41}}</ref> Upon its classification by the National Hurricane Center, a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] was issued for Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2003|title=Subtropical Storm Ana Public Advisory One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/pub/al012003.public.001.shtml?}}</ref> Meandering near the island for several days while developing, the storm dropped 2.63&nbsp;inches (67&nbsp;mm) of precipitation in a six day period at the [[Bermuda International Airport]]. Winds on the island did not reach tropical storm force.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bermuda Weather Service|year=2003|title=Bermuda Weather for April 2003|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2003-04.html}}</ref> Swells from the storm impacted the coast of [[Florida]].<ref name="tcr"/> The combination of the swells and an outgoing tide caused a boat to capsize in [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter Inlet]] on [[April 20]]; two of its occupants drowned, and the other two were rescued.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Ana Event Report|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~489312}}</ref> As an extratropical storm, the remnants of Ana dropped 0.87&nbsp;inches (22&nbsp;mm) of precipitation in the city of [[Ponta Delgada]] in the [[Azores]]. Moisture from the remnants of Ana also produced beneficial rainfall in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2003|title=April 2003 Global Tropical Cyclone Summary|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2003/summ0304.htm}}</ref> Two ships recorded tropical storm force winds in association with Ana; the '''Atlantic Forest''' recorded 51&nbsp;mph (82&nbsp;km/h) and a pressure of 998&nbsp;[[mbar]] on [[April 22]], and the '''Rosa Delmas''' reported winds of 47&nbsp;mph (76&nbsp;km/h) on [[April 23]].<ref name="tcr"/>

On [[April 20]], Ana became the second [[subtropical cyclone]] on record in the [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic basin]] in the month of April, after a [[Subtropical Storm One (1992)|subtropical storm]] in 1991. After attaining tropical characteristics, it became the first tropical storm on record in the month of April.<ref name="tcr"/> 

The name Ana was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and is on the tropical cyclone naming list for the [[Post-2008 Atlantic hurricane seasons|2009 season]].
