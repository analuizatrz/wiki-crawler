A '''robot''' is a [[machine|mechanical]] or [[virtual]], [[artificial]] [[Wiktionary:agent|agent]]. A robot is usually an [[Electromechanical|electro-mechanical]] [[system]], which, by its appearance or movements, conveys a sense that it has [[Intention|intent]] or [[Wiktionary:agency|agency]] of its own. The word ''robot'' can refer to both physical robots and virtual [[software agent]]s, but the latter are often referred to as [[Internet bot|''bots'']].<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&defl=en&q=define:BOT&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title Google: "define: bot"]</ref><ref>[http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_bot.html Alliance for Telecommunications Solutions: Telecom glossary "bot"]</ref>

While there is still discussion<ref>[http://botbuilder.org/showthread.php?p=276 Bot Builder forum subject: "Is a remote controlled robot a true robot?"]</ref><ref>[http://www.botmag.com/forum/showthread.php?t=240 Botmag forum subject: "What does "robot" mean to YOU?"]</ref><ref>[http://www.botmag.com/forum/showthread.php?t=285 Botmag challenge to define robot]</ref><ref>[[Talk:Robot]]</ref> about which machines qualify as robots, a typical robot will have several, though not necessarily all of the following properties:

* Is not '[[natural]]' / has been artificially created.
* Can sense its [[Wiktionary:environment|environment]].
* Can [[Manipulator|manipulate]] things in its environment.
* Has some degree of [[intelligence]], or ability to make choices based on the environment, or automatic control / preprogrammed sequence.
* Is [[Computer program|programmable]].
* Can move with one or more axes of [[Axis of rotation|rotation]] or [[Translation (geometry)|translation]].
* Can make [[Dexterity|dexterous]] coordinated [[Motion (physics)|movements]]. 
* Appears to have intent or agency ([[reification (fallacy)|reification]], [[anthropomorphisation]] or [[Pathetic fallacy]]<ref>[http://www.technologymarketing.com/bw/magazine/current/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003541524  Brandweek: Even Robot Suicide Is No Laughing Matter]</ref>).

==Defining characteristics==
The last property (above), the appearance of agency, is important when people are considering whether to call a machine a robot. In general, the more a machine has the appearance of agency, the more it is considered a robot.

[[Image:Knight_Rider_Supercar_KITT.jpg|thumb|120px|[[KITT]] is mentally anthropomorphic]]
'''Mental agency'''<br />
For robotic engineers, the physical appearance of a machine is less important than the way its actions are [[Control system|controlled]].<ref>[http://www.robotbuilder.co.uk/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=968 RobotBuilder Forum discussions: "Is THIS a robot?"]</ref> The more the control system seems to have agency of its own, the more likely the machine is to be called a robot. An important feature of agency is the ability to make choices. So the more a machine could feasibly choose to do something different, the more agency it has. For example:
* a [[clockwork]] car is never considered a robot.<ref>[http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22clockwork+robot+car Google search "clockwork robot car"]</ref>
* a [[Radio control|radio-controlled]] car is almost never considered a robot (though is sometimes known as a [[telerobotics|telerobot]]).
* a car with an onboard computer, like [[Bigtrak]], which could drive in a programmable sequence might be called a robot.
* a [[Smart car|self-controlled car]], like the entries to the [[DARPA_Grand_Challenge|DARPA Grand Challenge]], which could sense its environment, and make driving decisions based on this information would quite likely be called robot.
* a [[sentient]] car, like the fictional [[KITT]], which can take decisions, navigate freely and converse fluently with a human, is usually considered a robot.

[[Image:Asimo_look_new_design.jpg|thumb|120px|Asimo is physically anthropomorphic]]
'''Physical agency'''<br />
However, for many people, if a machine looks [[Wiktionary:anthropomorphic|anthropomorphic]] or [[Wiktionary:zoomorphic|zoomorphic]] (e.g. [[Asimo]] and [[Aibo]]), especially if it is [[limb]]-like (e.g. a simple [[Robot_arm|robot arm]]), or has limbs, or can move around, it would be called a robot.

For example, even if the following examples used the same control architecture:
* an [[Player_piano|automatic piano]] is rarely called a robot<ref>[http://www.wyastone.co.uk/nrl/gp_robot.html The Grand Piano Series: The History of The Robot]</ref>
* a [[CNC]] milling machine is very occasionally called a robot.
* a [[Factory robot|factory automation arm]] is usually called a robot.
* a zoomorphic mechanical toy, like [[Roboraptor]], is usually called a robot.<ref>[http://www.robotsrule.com/html/roboraptor.php Robots Rule: Roboraptor Product Information] which refers to Roboraptor as a 'robot'</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4164189.stm BBC News: A robot in every home?] in which Art Janis from [[WowWee]] refers to [[Robosapien]] as a "real robot"</ref>
* a humanoid, like [[ASIMO]], is almost always called a robot.

Interestingly, while a 3-axis CNC milling machine may have a very similar or identical control system to a robot arm, it is the arm which is almost always called a robot, while the CNC machine is usually just a machine. Having a limb can make all the difference. However, simply being anthropomorphic is not sufficient for something to be called a robot. A robot must do something, whether it is useful work or not. So, for example, a rubber dog chew, shaped like Asimo, would not be considered a robot.

==Other definitions of robot==

There is no one definition of robot which satisfies everyone, and many people have written their own. For example, [[International standard]] [[ISO 8373]] defines a "robot" as:
{{cquote|An automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose, manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications.<ref>[http://www.dira.dk/pdf/robotdef.pdf Definition of a robot]</ref>}}

[[Joseph Engelberger]], a pioneer in industrial robotics, once remarked
{{cquote|I can't define a robot, but I know one when I see one.<ref>[http://science.howstuffworks.com/robot.htm How Stuff Works: How Robots Work]</ref>}}

The [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/ Cambridge Online Dictionary] defines "robot" as:
{{cquote|A machine used to perform jobs automatically, which is controlled by a computer<ref>[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=68311&dict=CALD Cambridge Dictionary Online: Robot]</ref>}}

==History==
===Pre-history===
The idea of artificial people dates at least as far back as the ancient legends of [[Cadmus]], who sowed dragon teeth that turned into soldiers, and the myth of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], whose statue of [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]] came to life. In [[Greek mythology]], the deformed god of metalwork ([[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] or [[Hephaestus]]) created mechanical servants, ranging from intelligent, golden handmaidens to more utilitarian three-legged tables that could move about under their own power. Medieval [[Persia|Persian]] [[alchemist]] [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]], inventor of many basic processes still used in [[chemistry]] today, included recipes for creating artificial [[snake]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[human]]s in his coded ''Book of Stones''. [[Jew|Jewish]] legend tells of the [[Golem]], a clay creature animated by [[Kabbalism|Kabbalistic]] magic. Similarly, in the [[Younger Edda]], [[Norse mythology]] tells of a clay giant, Mökkurkálfi or Mistcalf, constructed to aid the troll Hrungnir in a duel with [[Thor]], the God of Thunder.

Concepts akin to today's robot can be found as long ago as 450 BC when the Greek mathematician [[Archytas]] of Tarentum postulated a mechanical bird he called "The Pigeon" which was propelled by [[steam]]. [[Heron of Alexandria]] (10AD-70AD) made numerous innovations in the field of automata, including one that (allegedly) could speak. 

In [[ancient China]], a curious account on automata is found in the ''Lie Zi'' text, written in the 3rd century BC. Within it there is a description of a much earlier encounter between [[King Mu of Zhou]] ([[1023 BC|1023]]-[[957 BC]]) and a mechanical engineer known as [[Yan Shi]], an 'artificer'. The latter proudly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical 'handiwork' ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):

<blockquote>
The king stared at the figure in astonishment. It walked with rapid strides, moving its head up and down, so that anyone would have taken it for a live human being. The artificer touched its chin, and it began singing, perfectly in tune. He touched its hand, and it began posturing, keeping perfect time...As the performance was drawing to an end, the robot winked its eye and made advances to the ladies in attendance, whereupon the king became incensed and would have had Yen Shih [Yan Shi] executed on the spot had not the latter, in mortal fear, instantly taken the robot to pieces to let him see what it really was. And, indeed, it turned out to be only a construction of leather, wood, glue and lacquer, variously coloured white, black, red and blue. Examining it closely, the king found all the internal organs complete—liver, gall, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, stomach and intestines; and over these again, muscles, bones and limbs with their joints, skin, teeth and hair, all of them artificial...The king tried the effect of taking away the heart, and found that the mouth could no longer speak; he took away the liver and the eyes could no longer see; he took away the kidneys and the legs lost their power of locomotion. The king was delighted.<ref name="needham volume 2 53">Needham, Volume 2, 53.</ref>
</blockquote>

Yet another early robot was the [[water clock|clepsydra]], which was made in 250 B.C.  It was created by [[Ctesibius]] of [[Alexandria,]] a [[Greece|Greek]] physicist and inventor. . <ref name="RoboticHistory1">[www.faculty.ucr.edu/~currie/roboadam.htm  The History of Robotics], Adam Currie, [[1999]].</ref>

[[Al-Jazari]] (1136-1206), an [[Arab]] inventor during the [[Artuqid dynasty]], designed and constructed automatic machines such as kitchen appliances and musical automats powered by [[water]] (See one of his works at [http://www.finns-books.com/auto.htm]). Al-Jazari also invented the first programmable [[humanoid robot]] in 1206. Al-Jazari's robot was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties.<ref>[http://www.shef.ac.uk/marcoms/eview/articles58/robot.html A 13th Century Programmable Robot.] [[University of Sheffield]].</ref>

One of the first recorded designs of a humanoid robot was made by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452-1519) in around 1495.  Da Vinci's notebooks, rediscovered in the 1950s, contain detailed drawings of a mechanical [[knight]] able to sit up, wave its arms and move its head and jaw. <ref name="RoboticHistory2">[ http://robotics.megagiant.com/history.html A Brief History of Robotics], MegaGiant Robotics, [[2005]].</ref> The design is likely to be based on his anatomical research recorded in the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]''. It is not known whether he attempted to build the robot (see: [[Leonardo's robot]]).
[[Image:EarlyRobot.jpg|thumb|right|290px|An early Japanese robot]]

The word robot was introduced by [[Czech]] writer [[Karel Čapek]] in his play ''[[R.U.R.]]'' (Rossum's Universal Robots) which was written in 1920 (See also [[Robots in literature]] for details of the play). <ref name= "RoboticHistory2"/> However, in an article in [[Lidové noviny]], [[Karel Čapek]] named his brother [[Josef Čapek]], a painter and a writer, as the true inventor of the word.<ref>http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html</ref> Regardless, the noun ''robota'', meaning "labour", "drudgery" used in the [[Czech language]] and other [[Slavic languages]], has been used since the early 10th century. 

An early [[automaton]] was created 1738 by [[Jacques de Vaucanson]], who created a mechanical duck that was able to eat and digest grain, flap its wings, and excrete. <ref name= "RoboticHistory2"/>
===Modern developments===
Many consider the first robot in the modern sense to be a teleoperated boat, similar to a modern [[ROV]], devised by [[Nikola Tesla]] and demonstrated at an 1898 exhibition in [[Madison Square Garden]]. Based on his patents {{US patent|613,809}}, {{US patent|723188}} and {{US patent|725,605}} for "teleautomation", Tesla hoped to develop the "wireless [[torpedo]]" into an automated weapon system for the US  Navy. (Cheney 1989) Tesla also proposed but did not build remotely operated war planes and ground vehicles. He also predicted these remote controlled machines were merely precursors of "machines possessed of their own intelligence" (Cheney 1989). See also the PBS website article (with photos) : [http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_robots.html Tesla - Master of Lightning: Race of Robots]

In the 1930s, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] made a humanoid robot known as [[Elektro]]. It was exhibited at the 1939 and 1940 [[World's Fair]]s while the first electronic [[autonomous robot]]s were created by [[William Grey Walter|W. Grey Walter]] at [[Bristol University]], [[England]] in 1948.

One of the first "modern" robots was named ''Elsie'', or the ''Bristol Tortoise''. It was developed by [[William Grey Walter]] in [[1948]]. This robot could sense light and contact with external objects, and use these stimuli to navigate. <ref name="RoboticHistory1">[ http://www.ias.uwe.ac.uk/Robots/gwonline/gwonline.html
The Grey Walter Online Archive], Owen Holland; Accessed [[April 30, [[2007]].</ref> 

The first truly modern robot, digitally operated, programmable, and teachable, was invented by [[George Devol]] and was called the [[Unimate]].  It is worth noting that not a single patent was cited against his original robotics patent (No. 2,988,237).  The first Unimate was personally sold by Devol to [[General Motors]] in 1960 and installed in 1961 in a plant in Trenton, New Jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die-casting machine and stack them. <ref name= "RoboticHistory1"/>

The first human to be killed by a robot was [[Robert Williams (robot fatality)|Robert Williams]] who died at a casting plant in Flat Rock, MI (Jan. 25, 1979). <ref name="a">[http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/PI/lib00187,0EB295F7D995F801.html  Death on the job: Jury awards $10 million to heirs of man killed by robot at auto plant], Tim Kiska, ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', [[August 11]], [[1983]].</ref><sup>,</sup><ref>[http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/PI/lib00187,0EB296EC28E31A97.html Death-by-robot yields award of $15 million], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', [[January 14]], [[1984]].</ref>

A better known case is that of 37 year-old [[Kenji Urada]], a Japanese factory worker, in 1981. Urada was performing routine maintenance on the robot, but neglected to properly shut down the robot, and was accidentally pushed into a grinding machine. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7001829 Trust me, I'm a robot], ''The Economist'', [[June 8]], [[2006]]; accessed online 4-30-2007.</ref>

==Contemporary uses ==
{{Main|Industrial robot|Domestic robot}}
Robots today have many missions, purposes, and motivations for their creation. They can be placed into roughly two categories based on the type of job they do:
* Jobs which a robot can do better than a human. Here, robots can increase productivity, accuracy, and endurance.
* Jobs which a human could do better than a robot, but it is desirable to remove the human for some reason. Here, robots free us from dirty, dangerous and dull tasks.

===Increased productivity, accuracy, and endurance===
[[Image:Industrial_Robotics_in_car_production.jpg|thumb|200px|Industrial robots doing vehicle under body assembly]]
Jobs which require speed, accuracy, reliability, and endurance can be performed far better by a robot than by a human. As as result, many jobs in factories, which were traditionally performed by people, are now robotized. This has lead to cheaper mass-produced goods, including automobiles and electronic goods. Robots have now been working in factories for more than fifty years, ever since the Unimate robot was installed to automatically remove hot metal from a die casting machine. Since then, factory automation, in the form of large stationary manipulators, has become the largest market for robots. The number of installed robots has grown faster and faster, and today there are more than 800,000 worldwide (42% in [[Japan]], 40% in the [[EU]] and 18% in the [[USA]]).<ref>[http://www.unece.org/press/pr2004/04stat_p01e.pdf United Nations Economic Commission for Europe: World Robotics 2004 survey]</ref>

[[Image:PlaceC5.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Pick and Place robot, Contact Systems C5 Series<ref>[http://www.contactsystems.com Contact Systems Pick and Place robots]</ref>]]
'''Some examples of factory robots include:'''
* [[Automaker|'''Car production''']] is now the primary example of factory automation, where, over the last three decades, automobile factories have become dominated by robots. A typical factory contains hundreds of [[industrial robots]] working on fully automated production lines (one robot for every ten human workers), assembling, welding and spray painting car bodies. On an automated production line a vehicle chassis is taken along a conveyor to be [[welding|welded]], [[glue|glued]], and [[paint|painted]] by a sequence of robot stations.
* [[Packaging|'''Packaging:''']] [[Industrial robots]] are also used extensively for palletising and packaging of manufactured goods, for example taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them rapidly into boxes, and loading and unloading of machining centers in factories.
* [[Electronics|'''Electronics:''']] Mass produced [[Printed_circuit_board|printed circuit boards]] (PCBs) are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots, typically with "[[SCARA]]" manipulators, which remove tiny [[Electronic_component|electronic components]] from strips or trays, and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy.<ref>[http://www.contactsystems.com/C7Series.htm Videos of Pick and Place robots]</ref> Such robots can place several components per second (tens of thousands per hour), far out-performing a human in terms of speed, accuracy, and reliability.<ref>[http://www.assembleon.com/InformationCenter/Assembleon/FTaboverview.asp?lNodeId=2958&lActiveTabArticleId=4005 Assembleon A-Series]</ref>
* [[AGV|'''Automated Guided Vehicles:''']] Large mobile robots, following markers or wires in the floor, or using vision<ref>[http://www.smartcaddy.net/ Smart Caddy by Seegrid]</ref> or lasers, are used to transport goods around large facilities, such as warehouses, container ports, or hospitals.<ref>[http://www.agvsystems.com/basics/vehicle.htm “The Basics of Automated Guided Vehicles”]. AGV Systems. Siemens. 5 March 2006</ref>

Tasks such as these suit robots perfectly because the tasks can be accurately defined and must be performed the same every time. Very little feedback or intelligence is required, and the robots may need only the most basic of [http://www.wordwebonline.com/en/EXTEROCEPTOR exteroceptors] (to sense things in their environment) if any at all.

[[image:Versatras150.jpg|right|thumb|VersaTrax150 pipe inspection robot reaches inaccessible places]]

===Dirty, dangerous, dull or inaccessible tasks===
There are many jobs which a human could perform better than a robot but for one reason or another the human either does not want to do it or cannot be present to do the job. The job may be too boring to bother with, for example domestic [[cleaning]]; or be too dangerous, for example exploring inside a [[volcano]]<ref>[http://www.ri.cmu.edu/projects/project_163.html The Robotics Institutge: Dante II]</ref>. These jobs are known as the "dull, dirty, and dangerous" jobs. Other jobs are physically inaccessable. For example, exploring another [[planet]]<ref>[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/mpf/rover.html NASA: Mars Pathfinder Mission: Rover Sojourner]</ref>, cleaning the inside of a long pipe or performing [[laparoscopic]] surgery.<ref>[http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2005_Groups/04/davinci.html Robot assisted surgery: da Vinci® Surgical System]</ref>

[[image:Roomba_original.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Roomba domestic vacuum cleaner robot does a boring job]]
* [[domestic robots|'''Robots in the home:''']] As their price falls, and their performance and computational ability rises<ref>[http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm Marshall Brain: Robotic Nation]</ref>, making them both affordable and sufficiently autonomous, robots are increasingly being seen in the home where they are taking on simple but unwanted jobs, such as [[Vacuum_cleaner|vacuum cleaning]], floor cleaning and [[Lawn_mower|lawn mowing]]. While they have been on the market for several years, 2006 saw an explosion in the number of domestic robots sold. Currently, more domestic robots have been sold than any other single type of robot.<ref>http://www.robots.com/articles.php?tag=961</ref> They tend to be relatively autonomous, usually only requiring a command to begin their job. They then proceed to go about their business in their own way. At such, they display a good deal of agency, and are considered true robots.

* [[Telerobot|'''Telerobots:''']] When a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessable, teleoperated robots, or [[Telerobotics|telerobots]] are used. Rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements a telerobot is controlled from a distance by a human operator. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. A [[laparoscopic]] [[surgery]] robot such as [http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/products/davincissurgicalsystem/index.aspx da Vinci] allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time.<ref>[http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2005_Groups/04/davinci.html Robotic Surgery: da Vinci® Surgical System]</ref> An interesting use of a telerobot is by the author [[Margaret Atwood]], who has recently started using a robot pen (the [http://www.longpen.com/lp-welcome.html LongPen]]) to sign books remotely. This saves the financial cost and physical inconvenience of traveling to book signings around the world.<ref>[http://www.gadgetgrocer.com/content/view/22/2/ Gadget Grocer: Author Invents Book-Signing Gadget]</ref> Such telerobots may be little more advanced than radio controlled cars. Some people do not consider them to be true robots because they show little or no agency of their own.

[[Image:RQ-9_Predator.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Predator, a teleoperated robot, keeps pilots out of danger]]
* [[Military_robot|'''Military robots:''']] Teleoperated robot aircraft, like this Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (right), are increasingly being used by the military. These robots can be controlled from anywhere in the world allowing an army to search terrain, and even fire on targets, without endangering those in control.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/200606120018 New Statesman: America's robot army]</ref> Currently, these robots are all teleoperated, but others are being developed which can make decisions automatically; choosing where to fly or selecting and engaging enemy targets.<ref>[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2005/06/battlefield-robots-to-iraq-and-beyond/index.php Defense Industry Daily: Battlefield Robots: to Iraq, and Beyond]</ref> Hundreds of robots such as the [[iRobot]] [[Packbot]] and the [[Foster-Miller TALON]] are being used for in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices ([[IED]]s) in an activity known as Explosive Ordnance Disposal ([[EOD]]).<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.11/bomb.html?pg=3&topic=bomb&topic_set= Wired Magazine: The Baghdad Bomb Squad ]</ref>

* '''Elder Care:''' The population is aging in many countries, including Japan, meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for but relatively fewer young people to care for them.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4012797.stm BBC News: Welcome to the ageing future]</ref><ref>[http://www.aoa.gov/prof/Statistics/statistics.asp Department of Health and Human Services: Administration on Aging]]</ref><ref>[http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/handbook/c02cont.htm Statistical Handbook of Japan: Chapter 2  Population]]</ref> Humans make the best carers, but where they are unavailable, robots are gradually being introduced.<ref>[http://www.e-health-insider.com/comment_and_analysis/index.cfm?ID=123 E-Health Insider: Robot revolution]</ref>

==Current developments==
[[image:Shadow_Hand_Bulb.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shadow Hand]], an advanced robot hand system, holding a lightbulb. Touch sensors in the fingertips allow it to apply gentle pressure.]]
The development of a robot with a natural human or animal [[gait]] is incredibly difficult and requires a large amount of computational power [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/race.html].  Now that background technologies of [[behavior]], [[navigation]] and path planning have been solved using basic wheeled robots, roboticists are moving on to develop walking robots (eg. [[SIGMO]], [[QRIO]], [[ASIMO]] & [[Hubo]]).  One approach to walk control is [[Passive dynamics]], where the robot's geometry is such that it will almost walk without active control.  

Initial work has focused on multi-legged robots (eg. [[Aibo]]), such as [[Hexapod (robotics)|hexapods]] [http://www.micromagic-sys.com/], as they are statically stable and so are easier to work with, whereas a bipedal robot must be able to balance.  The balancing problem is taken to an extreme by the [[Robotic unicycle]].  A problem with the development of robots with natural gaits is that human and animal bodies utilize a very large number of muscles in movement and replicating all of those mechanically is very difficult and expensive.  This field of robot research has become known as [[Biomorphic robotics]].

Progress is being made in the field of feedback and tactile sensors which allow a robot to sense their actions and adjust their behavior accordingly.  This is vital to enable robots to perform complex physical tasks that require some active control in response to the situation.

[[Robotic Surgery|Medical robotics]] is a growing field and regulatory approval has been granted for the use of robots in minimally invasive procedures.  Robots are being used in performing highly delicate, accurate surgery, or to allow a [[surgeon]] who is located remotely from their patient to perform a procedure using a robot controlled remotely. More recently, robots can be used autonomously in surgery [http://www.dlmag.com/1653/robot-successfully-completes-unassisted-heart-surgery.html].

Experimental winged robots and other examples exploiting [[biomimicry]] are also in early development.  So-called "[[nanomotor]]s" and "[[smart wire]]s" are expected to drastically simplify motive power, while in-flight stabilization seems likely to be improved by extremely small gyroscopes.  A significant driver of this work is military research into spy technologies.

Energetically autonomous robots is a field of study under the category of biologically inspired robotics, which aims to develop artificial agents that can remain self-sustainable in natural environments with minimum human intervention. This field of research spreads further into the fields of [[alternative energy sources]] and waste management, as it integrates the [[Microbial Fuel Cell]] technology with robotics, and allows for waste or food waste to be the 'fuel'. This class of robots is at the very early stages of development, however with great impact in applications such as the aforementioned unpleasant or dangerous for humans environments. Two examples of energetically autonomous robots that exist today are [[EcoBot]]s I and II. 

[[Internet bot]]s, also known as web robots, are automated internet applications controlled by software agents. The word "bot" in the term is a reference to the "robotic", mundane, repetitive tasks that the applications perform. ".<ref name="internet bot">

==Dangers and fears==
Although current robots are not believed to have developed to the stage where they pose any threat or danger to [[society]] [http://www.mobilerobots.com/ethicalRobotics.html],  fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films.  The principal theme is the robots' intelligence and ability to act could exceed that of humans, that they could develop a conscience and a motivation to take over or destroy the human race.  (See ''[[The Terminator]], [[The Matrix]], [[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'')

''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), sometimes called the first science fiction novel, has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or monster advancing beyond its creator.  Probably the best known author to have worked in this area is [[Isaac Asimov]] who placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works.  Of particular interest are Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics]]. 
Currently, malicious programming or unsafe use of robots may be the biggest danger.  Although industrial robots may be smaller and less powerful than other industrial machines, they are just as capable of inflicting severe injury on humans. However, since a robot can be programmed to move in different trajectories depending on its task, its movement can be unpredictable for a person standing in its reach. Therefore, most industrial robots operate inside a security fence which separates them from human workers. [[Manuel De Landa]] has theorized that humans are at a critical and significant juncture where humans have allowed robots, "smart missiles," and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception to make decisions about killing us. He believes this represents an important and dangerous trend where humans are transferring more of our cognitive structures into our machines.<ref>Manuel De Landa, ''War in the Age of Intelligent Machines'' (New York: Zone Books, 1991</ref> Even without malicious programming, a robot, especially a future model moving freely in a human environment, is potentially dangerous because of its large moving masses, powerful actuators and unpredictably complex behavior. A robot falling on someone or just stepping on his foot by mistake could cause much more damage to the victim than a human being of the same size. Designing and programming robots to be [[intrinsically safe]] and to exhibit safe behavior in a human environment is one of the great challenges in robotics. Some people suggest that developing a robot with a conscience may be helpful in this regard.

==Literature==
{{main|Robots in literature}}
{{see also|List of fictional robots and androids}}

Robots have frequently appeared as characters in works of literature and the first use of the word "robot" in literature can be found in [[Karel Capek]]'s play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'', written in 1920.  ''[[Isaac Asimov]]'' has written many volumes of [[science fiction]] focusing on robots in numerous forms and guises [http://samvak.tripod.com/robot.html].  Asimov contributed greatly to reducing the [[Frankenstein complex]], which dominated early works of fiction involving robots.  His [[three laws of robotics]] have become particularly well known for codifying a simple set of behaviors for robots to remain at the service of their human creators.

Numerous words for different types of robots are now used in literature.  Robot has come to mean mechanical humans, while [[android]] is a generic term for artificial humans. [[Cyborg]] or "[[bionic]] man" is used for a human form that is a mixture of organic and mechanical parts. Organic artificial humans have also been referred to as "constructs" (or "biological constructs").

==Robotics==

[[wikt:robotics|Robotics]] is the science and technology of robots, their design, manufacture, and application.<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/robotics Definition of robotics - Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]</ref> Robotics requires a working knowledge of [[electronics]], [[mechanics]], and [[software]]. A person working in the field is a [[roboticist]].  The word ''robotics'' was first used in print by Isaac Asimov, in his [[science fiction]] short story "[[Runaround]]". <ref>March 1942 issue of 'Astounding Science Fiction', Page 100</ref> 

Although the appearance and capabilities of robots vary vastly, all robots share the features of a mechanical, movable structure under some form of control.  The [[structure]] of a robot is usually mostly [[machine|mechanical]] and can be called a [[Kinematics|kinematic chain]] (its functionality being akin to the skeleton of a body).  The chain is formed of links (its bones), [[actuator]]s (its muscles) and joints which can allow one or more degrees of freedom. Most contemporary robots use open serial chains in which each link connects the one before to the one after it. These robots are called  [http://www.roble.info/robotics/serial/html/SerialRobots-1se2.html serial robots] and often resemble the human arm. Some robots, such as the [[Stewart platform]], use closed parallel kinematic chains. Other structures, such as those that mimic the mechanical structure of humans, various animals and insects, are comparatively rare. However, the development and use of such structures in robots is an active area of research (e.g. [[biomechanics]]). Robots used as manipulators have an [[end effector]] mounted on the last link. This end effector can be anything from a welding device to a mechanical hand used to manipulate the environment.

The mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases - perception, processing and action ([[robotic paradigms]]). [[Sensor]]s give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). Using strategies from the field of [[control theory]], this information is processed to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators ([[Electric motor|motor]]s) which move the mechanical structure. The control of a robot involves various aspects such as path planning, pattern recognition, obstacle avoidance, etc. More complex and adaptable control strategies can be referred to as [[artificial intelligence]].

Any task involves the motion of the robot. The study of motion can be divided into [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]. Direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]] when the corresponding joint values are known. Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), [[collision]] avoidance and [[Mechanical singularity|singularity]] avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities and accelerations have been calculated using [[kinematics]], methods from the field of [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] are used to study the effect of [[forces]] upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in [[computer simulations]] of the robot. Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.

In each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones and improve the interaction between these areas. To do this, criteria for "optimal" performance and ways to optimize design, structure and control of robots must be developed and implemented.

==Robots and Human-Machine interfaces==

Robotics has also application in the design of [[virtual reality]] interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use in the [[haptic]] research community. These robots, called "haptic interfaces" allow touch-enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments. Robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of "virtual" objects, which users can experience through their sense of [[touch]] (see [http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17363&ch=biotech&sc=&pg=1 the MIT Technology review article "The Cutting Edge of Haptics"]).

==Competitions==
{{seealso|Robot competition|FIRST|FIRST Lego League|FIRST Vex™ Challenge}}

[[Image:Robocup Team Osaka's VisiON.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Plen|A robot practicing]] for [[Robocup]]]]

[[Botball]] is a [[LEGO]]-based competition between fully [[autonomous]] robots. There are two divisions. The first is for high-school and middle-school students, and the second (called "Beyond Botball") is for anyone who chooses to compete at the national tournament. Teams build, program, and blog about a robot for five weeks before they compete at the [[regional]] level. Winners are awarded [[scholarships]] to register for and travel to the national tournament. Botball is a project of the [[KISS Institute for Practical Robotics]], based in Norman, Oklahoma.

The [[FIRST Robotics Competition]] is a multinational competition that teams professionals and young people to solve an engineering design problem. These teams of mentors (corporate, teachers, or college students) and high school students collaborate in order to design and build a robot in six weeks. This robot is designed to play a game that is developed by [[FIRST]] and changes from year to year. [[FIRST]], or For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, is an organization that was founded by inventor [[Dean Kamen]] in 1992 as a way of getting high school students involved in and excited about engineering and technology. For more information visit [http://www.usfirst.org FIRST's website].

The [[FIRST Vex™ Challenge]] (FVC) is a mid-level [[robotics]] competition targeted toward high-school aged students. It offers the traditional challenge of a FIRST competition but with a more accessible and affordable robotics kit. The ultimate goal of FVC is to reach more young people with a lower-cost, more accessible opportunity to discover the excitement and rewards of science, technology, and engineering. For more information visit [http://www.usfirst.org/vex/ The FIRST Vex Challenge website].

[[FIRST Lego League]] (also known by its acronym FLL) is a robotics competition for elementary and middle school students (ages 9-14, 9-16 in Europe), arranged by the [[FIRST]] organization. Each year the contest focuses on a different topic related to the sciences. Each challenge within the competition then revolves around that theme. The students then work out solutions to the various problems that they're given and meet for regional tournaments to share their knowledge and show off their ideas. For more information visit [http://www.usfirst.org/jrobtcs/flego.htm First Lego League's website]. 

Competitions for [[talha robots]] are gaining popularity and competitions now exist catering for a wide variety of robot builders ranging from schools [http://www.usfirst.org/] to research institutions.  Robots compete at a wide range of tasks including [[Robot combat|combat]], fire-fighting [http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot], playing games [http://www.cooper.edu/~mar/mobile_robots_fall2005.html], maze solving, performing tasks [http://maslab.csail.mit.edu/] and navigational exercises (eg. [[DARPA Grand Challenge]]) [http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-09-10] [http://www.me.vt.edu/grandchallenge/]

A contest for fire-fighting is the [http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot Trinity College Fire-Fighting Robot Contest].  The competition in April 2007 will be the 14th annual.  This is great for all skill levels because there are many different divisions.  Robots in the competition are encouraged to find new ways to navigate through the rooms, put out the candle and save the "child" from the building.  Robots can be composed of any materials, but must fit within certain size restrictions

Most recently, [[Duke University]] announced plans to host the [[Duke Annual Robo-Climb Competition]] (DARC) aimed to challenge students to create innovative wall-climbing robots that can autonomously ascend vertical surfaces. For more information visit [http://robotics.pratt.duke.edu/roboclimb/index.htm DARC's Website]

A competition that has existed for several years is the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]], pitting [[driverless car]]s against each other in an obstacle course across the desert.
