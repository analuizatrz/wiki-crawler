The '''Battle of Jilib''' was a battle in the [[War in Somalia (2006–present)|2006 Somali War]] fought by the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU) and affiliated militias against [[Ethiopia]]n and [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) forces for control of the town of [[Jilib]]. It began on [[December 31]], [[2006]], when ICU forces dug in and defended the town to prevent approach to [[Kismayo]], the last stronghold of the ICU.

==Background==
After the [[Fall of Mogadishu]], roughly 3,000 ICU fighters were said to have fled towards the port city of [[Kismayo]], their last remaining stronghold, 300&nbsp;miles (500&nbsp;km) to the south.<ref>{{cite news

In Jilib, the [[Islamism|Islamists]] used bulldozers to prepare trenches and defensive positions. They had about 3,000 fighters and 60 [[Technical (fighting vehicle)|technicals]] mounted with antiaircraft and antitank guns. Up to 4,700 people fled the area ahead of the fighting.<ref name=SOMALI-ISLAMISTS-ATTACKED-NEAR-LAST-BASTION>{{cite news

==Battle==
On Sunday, [[December 31]], fighting began in the thick mango forests near Helashid, 11 miles (18&nbsp;km) to the northwest of Jilib. Ethiopian [[MiG]] fighters, tanks, artillery and mortars struck Islamic positions in the assault. Residents reported the road to Jilib was littered with remote-controlled [[landmine]]s by the ICU.<ref name=THOUSANDS-FLEE-SOMALIA-FIGHTING>{{cite news

Somali Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Ismail Mohammed Hurreh Buba]] (also spelled Esmael Mohamud Hurreh) declared fighting was going well for the government, and the battles around Kismayo might take another two days. He asked for Somalia's coast to be watched for ''[[dhow]]s'', small boats which might come and try to rescue or reinforce the Islamists in Kismayo.<ref name ="CHIEFS-OF-STATE-AND-CABINET-MEMBERS-OF-FOREIGN-GOVT-SOMALIA">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications//chiefs/chiefs164.html  Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments] CIA, [[November 22]][[2006]]</ref><ref>{{cite news

During the night, artillery strikes continued, eventually forcing the ICU frontlines to falter. A mutiny within the ICU caused their forces to disintegrate, and abandon both Jilib and Kismayo. At 10&nbsp;p.m., the sounds of battle died down.<ref>{{cite news

As a result, the transitional government requested that Kenya seal its border with Somalia.  According to the BBC, Kenyan armored vehicles appeared heading toward the border, though the government made no formal statements.<ref>{{cite news

== Aftermath ==
With the ICU in a retreat for the Kenyan border, [[Transitional Federal Government]] forces slowly advanced towards [[Kismayo]] to avoid the many landmines that had been placed. By [[January 1]], [[2007]], they had reached Kismayo, which was taken [[Fall of Kismayo|without a fight]].<ref name="last strongholds"/>

Thereafter, operations moved towards securing the borders with Kenya in the provinces of [[Afmadow]] and [[Badhadhe]] in the [[Lower Juba]] region. Ethiopian aircraft and attack helicopters struck the town of Doble ([[Dhoobley]]) in Afmadow province, not far from the Kenyan border. The strikes were presumably to hit ICU elements attempting to cross the border. Fighting tailed off after midnight.<ref name=BATTLE-FOR-SOMALIA-NEARS-KENYAN-BORDER>{{cite news

On [[January 4]], reports said ICU troops were split across Afmadow and Badade districts, and possibly concentrated at the former [[Al-Ittihad Al-Islamiya]] (AIAI) stronghold of [[Ras Kamboni]].<ref name=6-KENYANS-KILLED-IN-SOMALIA-AIR-STRIKES>{{cite news
