{{nihongo|'''''Metal Gear Solid'''''|メタルギアソリッド|Metaru Gia Soriddo|commonly abbreviated as '''''MGS'''''}} is a [[stealth game|stealth-action]] [[video game]] directed by [[Hideo Kojima]].<ref name="techinfo">{{cite web | title=Metal Gear Solid Tech Info/Credits | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/adventure/metalgearsolid/tech_info.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The game was [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Konami]] Computer Entertainment Japan and first [[video game publisher|published]] by Konami in [[1998 in video gaming|1998]] for the [[PlayStation]] [[video game console]]. It is the third [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] title in the [[Metal Gear (series)|''Metal Gear'' series]], and a [[sequel]] to ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]''. The game implements several cinematic qualities, such as meticulously recreated Hollywood-like [[cut scenes]] and top-notch sound design and voice acting.<ref>{{cite web | title=The History of MetalGear - Metal Gear Solid| url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/mg_history/| publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessmonthday=June 13 |accessyear=2008}}</ref>

The story of ''Metal Gear Solid'' follows [[Solid Snake]], a retired soldier who infiltrates a [[nuclear weapon]]s disposal facility to neutralize the terrorist threat from [[FOXHOUND]], a renegade [[special forces]] unit.<ref>'''Colonel Campbell''': Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND. They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon. (''Metal Gear Solid'', Briefing Mode) Konami Computer Entertainment Japan West, 1998</ref> Snake must liberate two hostages, the head of [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] and the president of a major arms manufacturer, confront the terrorists, and stop them from launching a nuclear strike.<ref>'''Colonel Campbell''': You'll have two mission objectives. First, you're to rescue the DARPA Chief, Donald Anderson, and the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker. They're both being held as hostages. Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability to launch a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do. (''Metal Gear Solid'', introductory sequence) Konami Computer Entertainment Japan West, 1998</ref>

''Metal Gear Solid'' was well-received, shipping more than six million copies,<ref name="sales">{{cite web | author=Big Gaz | title=Metal Gear Solid 3 Exclusive For Sony | url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/mag.dyn/Features/1751.html | date=May 15, 2003 | publisher=[[Gameplanet]] | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> and scoring an average of 94 out of 100 on the aggregate website [[Metacritic]].<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web | title=Metal Gear Solid (psx: 1998): Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/psx/metalgearsolid | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessmonthday=July 7 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>
The commercial success of the title prompted the release of an expanded version for the PlayStation and [[personal computer|PC]], titled ''Metal Gear Solid: Integral'';<ref name="japanintegralrelease" /> and a remake, ''[[Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes]]'' was later released for the [[Nintendo GameCube]].<ref name="integralpcrelease" /><ref name="ttsrelease" /> The game has also spawned numerous [[sequel]]s, [[prequel]]s, a port of the game to [[Windows]] PCs and [[spin-off]]s, including several games, a radio drama, comics, and a novel.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:MGS screen psx.jpg|left|thumb||Solid Snake hiding from a guard. When Snake leans on a corner, the camera shifts to his front for dramatic effect and to enable sight down corridors.]]
Despite a transition to [[3D computer graphics|3D]], ''Metal Gear Solid's'' gameplay remains similar to its [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[MSX#MSX2|MSX2]] predecessor ''Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.'' The player must navigate the [[protagonist]], Solid Snake, through the game's areas without being detected by enemies.<ref>{{cite web | title=Metal Gear Solid | url=http://psx.ign.com/objects/000/000569.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Detection is triggered by the player moving into an enemy's [[field of vision]] and sets off an alarm that draws armed enemies to his location.<ref name="gs1">{{cite web | author=Kasavin, Greg | title=Metal Gear Solid (PC) review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/metalgearsolid/review.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=October 2, 2000 | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> This also triggers "alert mode" and the player must then hide and remain undetected, at which point “evasion mode” begins and once the counter reaches zero the game returns to "infiltration mode" where enemies are not suspicious of Snake’s presence. The radar cannot be used in alert or evasion mode.<ref name="gameguide" />

To remain undetected, the player can perform techniques which make use of Solid Snake's abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to distract enemies. These are carried out using the [[Third-person shooter|third-person camera]]; which often changes its angle to give the player the best view of the area possible, and an on-screen [[radar]], which displays enemies and their field of vision.<ref name="gsguide">{{cite web | author=Mielke, James | title=Metal Gear Solid Strategy Guide | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/psx/mgs_gg/ | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessmonthday=November 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets, such as [[Thermography|infra-red goggles]] or a [[cardboard box]] disguise.<ref>{{cite web | author=House, Matthew | title=Metal Gear Solid – Overview | url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:14082 | publisher=[[Allgame]] | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay, as fights against large groups of enemies will often result in serious damage for the player.<ref name="manual">{{cite web | title=Metal Gear Solid PC – Instructional Manual | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/1/8/b180af00-6eae-490e-88d6-71ec4f4af01a/metalgearsolid_booklet_EN.pdf | publisher=[[Konami]] / [[Microsoft]] | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007|format=PDF}}</ref>

Intermixed with the player's progress are [[cut scene]]s and [[Receiver (radio)|codec]] conversations as well as encounters with [[Boss (video games)|bosses]]. To progress, players must discover the weaknesses of each boss to defeat them. Game controls and play strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad. The Codec is also used to provide [[exposition]] on the game's [[backstory]]. Completion of the title provides the player with a statistical summary of their performance, and a "code name" based upon it, typically the name of a common animal.

In a first for the ''Metal Gear'' series, a training mode is available in which players can practice hiding techniques, weapons use, and sneaking. In addition to the stealth gameplay, there are [[set piece]] sequences that entail firefights between the player and enemies from the third-person and [[First person shooter|first-person]] perspectives.<ref name="gameguide">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Konami staff | title=Metal Gear Solid instruction manual | pages=49 | publisher=Konami | language=English | id=SLES-01370}}</ref>

===Characters===
{{main|List of Metal Gear Solid characters}}
The [[protagonist]] of ''Metal Gear Solid'' is Solid Snake, a legendary infiltrator and saboteur. His physique is based on [[Jean Claude Van Damme]], while his facial appearance was originally based on [[Christopher Walken]].<ref>{{cite web|Konami site staff|url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/metalgear/art/snake_v.html|title=Yoji Shinkawa's Art Gallery from the official ''Metal Gear Solid'' website|accessdate= 19 July|accessyear = 2006|date=9 |year=1998 |month=July|publisher=Konami|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Metal Gear Solid: Official Mission Handbook|last=Hodgson |first=David S.J.|year=1998|publisher=Millennium Publications Inc. |pages=142}}</ref> During the mission, Snake receives support and advice via radio. Colonel [[List of recurring Metal Gear characters#Roy Campbell|Roy Campbell]], Solid Snake's former [[commanding officer]], supports Snake with advice and tactics. While he initially keeps a number of secrets from Snake, he gradually reveals them.<ref>'''Campbell''': Snake, I'm sorry I kept a lot of things from you. (''Metal Gear Solid'')</ref> He is joined by [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Naomi Hunter|Naomi Hunter]], who gives medical advice; [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Nastasha Romanenko|Nastasha Romanenko]], who provides item and weapon tips; [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Master Miller|Master Miller]], a former drill instructor and survival coach; and [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Mei Ling|Mei Ling]], who saves the player's progress.

The main [[antagonist]] of the game is [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Liquid Snake|Liquid Snake]], leader of the now-terrorist organization FOXHOUND, and genetic counterpart to Solid Snake.<ref name="gameguide" /> An elite [[special forces]] unit, FOX-HOUND contains experts specializing in unique tasks. Members are [[Revolver Ocelot]], a Western-style gunslinger and expert interrogator whose weapon of choice is the [[Colt Single Action Army]]; [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Sniper Wolf|Sniper Wolf]], a preternatural sniper; [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Vulcan Raven|Vulcan Raven]], a hulking Alaskan [[Shamanism|shaman]] armed with an [[M61 Vulcan]] torn from a downed F-16; [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Psycho Mantis|Psycho Mantis]], a psychic profiler and [[psychokinesis]] expert; and [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Decoy Octopus|Decoy Octopus]], a master of disguise.<ref name="gameguide" />

Other characters include [[List of recurring Metal Gear characters#Meryl Silverburgh|Meryl Silverburgh]], Roy Campbell's daughter (though this is only revealed in the Otacon ending) and a rookie soldier stationed in Shadow Moses who did not join the revolt; [[List of recurring Metal Gear characters#Otacon|Dr. Hal "Otacon" Emmerich]], the lead developer of [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Metal Gear REX|Metal Gear REX]]; and the Cyborg Ninja, a mysterious cybernetically-enhanced agent who is neither an ally nor an enemy of Snake but does oppose FOXHOUND.<ref name="gameguide" />

===Plot===
[[Image:Metal Gear Solid - Metal Gear REX.jpg|thumb|right|Solid Snake in battle against [[Metal Gear REX]].]]
The game is set in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mgs3_sub/america/mgs/saga.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence website – Metal Gear Saga vol. 1 section|accessdate=January 12|accessyear=2006}}</ref> where FOXHOUND and a genetically enhanced next-generation special forces unit lead an armed uprising on a remote island in [[Alaska]]'s [[Fox Islands (Alaska)|Fox Archipelago]]. This island, codenamed Shadow Moses, is the site of a nuclear weapons disposal facility.<ref name="manual"/> The forces that seized this island have acquired the nuclear-capable [[mecha]] Metal Gear REX, and are threatening the US government with a nuclear reprisal if they do not receive the remains of the "legendary mercenary" [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] within 24 hours.<ref name="history1">{{cite web | author=Shoemaker, Brad | title=GameSpot's The History of MetalGear | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/mg_history/ | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessmonthday=October 22 |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

As the game begins, Solid Snake is dispatched at the request of Colonel Roy Campbell to penetrate the terrorists' defenses and neutralize the threat.<ref>{{cite web | author=Stratosphere | title=Metal Gear Solid Brief Synopsis  | url=http://metalgearsolid.org/show_features.php?id=461  | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070130214924/http://www.metalgearsolid.org/show_features.php?id=461  | archivedate=2007-01-30 | work=[http://www.metalgearsolid.org/ Metal Gear Solid: The Unofficial Site] | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Snake is also ordered to locate hostages DARPA Chief [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Donald Anderson|Donald Anderson]], and ArmsTech president [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Kenneth Baker|Kenneth Baker]]. After being found, the DARPA Chief informs Snake of the new Metal Gear REX unit housed at the facility, but then suddenly dies of what appears to be a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].<ref>'''Master Miller:''' The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,… die of something that looked like a heart attack? ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Snake then finds the other hostage, Kenneth Baker. Revolver Ocelot challenges Snake to a gunfight, which is interrupted by a mysterious cyborg ninja who cuts off Ocelot's hand. Baker briefs Snake on the Metal Gear project and, like the DARPA Chief, suddenly dies of a "heart attack".

Snake then contacts Meryl via radio, and agrees to meet her in the base's warhead disposal area on the condition that he contacts Metal Gear's designer, Hal "Otacon" Emmerich. Snake locates Otacon in his lab. The ninja reappears, and Snake realizes that it is actually his former ally [[List of recurring Metal Gear characters#Gray Fox|Gray Fox]], whom he believed killed years earlier. Otacon agrees to aid Snake remotely, using special camouflage to procure information and supplies while he remains invisible. Snake meets with Meryl and agrees for her to accompany him on his mission. Meryl gives Snake a PAL key and they head for the underground base. Part way through the base, Sniper Wolf ambushes them, wounds Meryl, and captures Snake.

While imprisoned, Liquid confirms Snake's suspicion that they are twin brothers.<ref>Liquid: Were both the last surviving sons of Big Boss…</ref> Snake is tortured by Ocelot<ref>'''Liquid:''' (to Ocelot) We're shorthanded, so make this little torture show of yours as short as possible. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and the player can choose to give in to this torture, or not. When Snake is taken to his cell, he discovers the body of DARPA Chief Donald Anderson lying in the corner; however, though it was only hours before did Snake watch Anderson die in front of him, the body has been decomposing as if he were dead for days. Eventually Snake is able to escape.

As Snake makes his way up the facility's communications tower, he is ambushed by Liquid in attack helicopter, but swiftly defeats him. As he emerges from the tower onto the snowfield he is confronted once again by Sniper Wolf, and after a second duel he fatally wounds her. Otacon, enamoured with Wolf, is overcome with grief as Snake is forced to execute her. Snake descends into the bowels of the Shadow Moses facility. After defeating Vulcan Raven, the shaman reveals to Snake that the man he watched die was not the DARPA Chief. It was Decoy Octopus.<ref>'''Raven:''' ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> However, Raven leaves the cause of death for Snake to find out. Shortly after, Master Miller calls and reveals that Dr. Naomi Hunter, a support agent, has given Snake the genetically engineered virus "FoxDie" during his mission preparations, and is sending coded messages into the facility. Campbell swiftly orders her arrest. The virus, designed to kill people with particular genetic markers via cardiac arrest,<ref>'''Master Miller:''' Snake, have you ever heard of something called "Fox Die"? It's some kind of virus that targets specific people. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref><ref>'''Master Miller:''' Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection? She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> was responsible for the deaths of Octopus and the ArmsTech president.<ref>'''Master Miller:''' Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,… die of something that looked like a heart attack? Well, apparently Fox Die kills its victims by simulating a heart attack. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Naomi contacts Snake and confesses that she joined the mission to sabotage it. But upon learning of Snake's own past, she no longer had the heart to kill him directly having reprogrammed the virus.<ref>'''Naomi Hunter''' You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref>

Infiltrating Metal Gear's hangar, Snake overhears Liquid and Ocelot preparing the launch sequence for Metal Gear REX. Thinking he is deactivating it, using the PAL key, Snake activates Metal Gear REX.<ref>'''Computer:''' PAL code number three confirmed. PAL code entry complete… ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Master Miller then reveals himself to be Liquid in disguise. He informs Snake that his entire mission was manipulated by the renegades to allow the launch of the nuclear weapon.<ref>'''Campbell:''' Snake, you've been talking to… '''Liquid:''' …Me… dear brother. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Liquid explains that they are the product of the ''Les Enfants Terribles'' project, a government sponsored effort to [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] Big Boss, that was conducted during the 1970s. Liquid explains that Solid received all of Big Boss' dominant alleles,while he received all the recessive alleles.<ref>'''Liquid:''' It is for this purpose that we were created. '''Snake:''' Created? '''Liquid:''' Yes, created, Les Enfantes Terrible…the terrible children. Clones of Big Boss</ref><ref>'''Snake:''' You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to input the detonation code? ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> He also reveals to Snake the government's true reason for sending him in: his FoxDie would kill all the members of FOXHOUND, allowing the government to retrieve REX undamaged.

Snake destroys Metal Gear REX and is challenged again by Liquid. He fights Liquid atop REX and defeats him after knocking him over the edge. He is then reunited with Meryl or Otacon, depending on the player's actions. They escape, while being chased by Liquid, in a jeep. Liquid dies from the FoxDie virus.<ref>'''Snake:''' Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Colonel Campbell, briefly ousted from command of the mission, calls off a nuclear airstrike intended to obliterate the evidence of the day's events and officially declares Snake killed in action to stop the US government's search for him in the future.

There are two possible endings, depending on the player's actions during the torture sequence. If the player gives in to the torture, Snake finds Meryl dead and escapes with Otacon. If the player does not give in to the torture, Meryl survives and escapes with Snake while Otacon volunteers to stay behind and sacrifice himself to help Snake and Meryl get out, not knowing that the nuclear strike intended to hit the disposal facility would never come (Meryl surviving is the canon ending).

After the end credits the player finds out Snake is actually genetically inferior to Liquid<ref>'''Ocelot:''' Until the very end, Liquid thought he was the inferior one. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and has an indeterminate amount of time left before FoxDie kills him. Ocelot is revealed to be a double agent for the [[President of the United States]], George Sears (the third Snake, [[List of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty characters#Solidus Snake|Solidus]]). His intention was to obtain Baker's disk containing Metal Gear's specifications and deliver it to the President, and kill whoever knew of his true motives, the reason for his "accidental" killing of the DARPA Chief.<ref>'''Ocelot:''' The vector? Yes sir, FoxDie should become activated soon… ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> The reason why Ocelot kills Anderson goes deeper into the ''Metal Gear'' saga.

[[Image:Snake from Policenauts.PNG|frame|right|An early artwork of Snake and Meryl, featured as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in the ''[[Policenauts|Policenauts: Pilot Disk]]'' for the 3DO.]]
Kojima originally planned the third ''Metal Gear'' game, to be called ''Metal Gear 3'', and to release it for the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]]. Conceptual artwork, by illustrator [[Yoji Shinkawa]], of the characters [[Solid Snake]], [[Meryl Silverburgh]], who was also a character in the adventure game ''[[Policenauts]]'', and the FOXHOUND team, were included in the ''Policenauts: Pilot Disk'' preceding the release of the full 3DO game in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]].<ref>{{cite video game|title = Policenauts Pilot Disk|developer=[[Konami]]|platform=[[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]]|language=Japanese|isolang=ja}}</ref> However due to the decline of the 3DO hardware, development of the game shifted to the PlayStation shortly after it was released.

Kojima retitled the game ''Metal Gear Solid'', choosing this over the working title ''Metal Gear 3''. This was due to the fact that he believed that the first two MSX2 games in the series were not very well known.<ref name=mg3>{{cite book|quote='''Kojima''': "Metal Gear" is as it is, and "Solid" has a deep meaning. Let me explain. This time Metal Gear is displayed in full polygonal form, and I used "Solid" to describe the cubic structure. also, the "Solid" means to the third power mathematically. Also, most of the people don't know that there is a Metal Gear 1 and 2 for the MSX, and I wanted it to be the sequel for those. And, of course, Solid from Solid Snake.|title=Metal Gear Solid: Official Mission Handbook|author=Hogdson, David}}</ref> He used the word 'Solid' which was chosen due to the game being the third installment in the series, and because it uses [[3D computer graphics]].<ref name="kent">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerstoday.com/world_tour/kojima/index.html | title=Hideo Kojima: Game Guru, Movie Maniac | author = Kent, Steven | publisher = Gamers Today | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Sequels to this game also use the ''Metal Gear Solid'' title, and follow a new numeral progression.

The development for ''Metal Gear Solid'' began in mid-[[1995 in video gaming|1995]]<ref>{{cite web | author=GameSpot staff | title=Metal Gear Solid Comes to the Nintendo 64 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2466851.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=June 17, 1997 | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> with the intention of creating the "best PlayStation game ever"<!-- Who said this? -->.<ref name="gsold" /> Developers aimed for accuracy and realism while making the game enjoyable and tense.

To fulfill this, adjustments were made to every detail, such as individually designed desks.<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN staff | title=More News From Metal Gear Solid Creator | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/064/064632p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] |date=April 28, 1998|accessmonthday=November 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Hideo Kojima created the characters of ''Metal Gear Solid''. Modifications and mechanics were made by conceptual artist [[Yoji Shinkawa]]. The characters were completed by polygonal artists using pencil drawings and clay models by Shinkawa.<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN staff | title=The Art of Design: MGS2 & Z.O.E. | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/088/088856p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=December 12, 2000 | accessmonthday=November 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Kojima wanted greater interaction with objects and the environment, such as allowing the player to hide bodies in a storage compartment. Additionally, he wanted "a full orchestra right next to the player"; a system which made modifications such as [[tempo]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] to the currently playing track, instead of switching to another pre-recorded track.

The "VR Disc" features over 300 missions testing the player's sneaking and fighting skills, as well as less conventional tests, such as murder mysteries, battling giant genome soldiers, and three missions where the player controls the Cyborg Ninja.

The game was generally well received by the media and some of the most prominent gaming critics. Users and critics of [[GamePro]] gave it an average score of 4.8 out of 5 calling it "this season's top offering [game] and one game no self-respecting gamer should be without". However they criticized the [[frame rate]], saying it "occasionally stalls the eye-catching graphics" and "Especially annoying are instances where you zoom in with binoculars or the rifle scope", and also the interruptions of "advice from your team", in the early parts of the game, calling it an "annoyance".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamepro.com/sony/psx/games/reviews/236.shtml|accessdate = 2007-01-15|title = Review: Metal Gear Solid|author=MAJORMIKE|date=2005-07-13|publisher=[[GamePro]]}}</ref> [[GameSpot]] also criticized this, saying "It needlessly interrupts the game".

''Metal Gear Solid'' is often recognized for popularizing the [[stealth game]] genre. The idea of the player being unarmed and having to avoid being seen by enemies rather than fight them has been used in many games since. It is also sometimes acclaimed as being a film as much as a game due to the lengthy [[cut scenes]] and complicated storyline.<ref>{{cite web | title=Sneak Attack| url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3136603 | work=1up | accessmonthday=May 15 | accessyear=2008}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said it "broke new ground with...movie-style production...and stealth-driven gameplay, which encouraged...hiding in boxes and crawling across floors".<ref name="Entertainment Weekly"/> [[GameTrailers]] said it "invented the stealth game" and called it "captivating, inventive and gritty".<ref name="GameTrailers"/> The game is often considered one of the best games for the [[PlayStation]], and has featured in best video games lists by [[GameFAQs]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Fall 2005: 10-Year Anniversary Contest – The 10 Best Games Ever| url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/top10 | publisher=[[GameFAQs]] | accessmonthday=November 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> [[Game Rankings]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/simpleratings.asp?rankings=y | title = The Rankings | publisher = [[Game Rankings]] | accessdate = 2008-06-09 }}</ref> Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'',<ref>{{cite web | author=Colin Campbell | year=2006 | title=Japan Votes on All Time Top 100| url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2401&Itemid=2 | work=[http://www.next-gen.biz/ Next Generation] | accessmonthday=March 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'',<ref name="Entertainment Weekly">{{cite web | author=''EW'' staff| year=2006 | title=The 100 greatest video games: 21–30 | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/commentary/0,6115,450400_8||395800|1_0_,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessmonthday=November 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''[[Game Informer]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | title=Top 100 Games of All Time | journal=Game Informer | volume=100 | year=2001 | month=August | pages=34 }}</ref> ''GamePro'',<ref>{{cite journal | title=10 Modern Classics Every Gamer Should Own | journal=GamePro | volume=200 | year=2005 | month=May | pages=49 }}</ref> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030611191341/http%3A//gamers.com/feature/egmtop100/index.jsp|title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's 100 Best Games of All Time| author=''EGM'' staff | year=2001| accessmonthday=November 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and GameTrailers.<ref name="GameTrailers">{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/15147.html|title=Top Ten Best and Worst Games of All Time|date=2006-11-17|accessdate=2008-05-13|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]}}</ref> However, its placing in these lists is inconsistent, ranging from 2nd to 50th.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.filibustercartoons.com/games.htm | title=The Best Video Games in the History of Humanity | accessdate=May 14 | accessyear=2008}}</ref>
