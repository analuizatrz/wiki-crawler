'''The Burglar''', also known as '''Dennis Carradine''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is best known as the first criminal faced by [[Spider-Man]], and as the killer of [[Ben Parker]].  He first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962).

The burglar's real name was never revealed in the comics  In the [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|''Spider-Man: The Movie'' video game]]  (based on [[Spider-Man (film)|the 2002 film]]), he is called "Spike", though this may be simply a nickname.  In the film ''[[Spider Man 3]]'', [[Captain Stacy]] revealed that the burglar's real name was Dennis Carradine. 

==Fictional character biography==
Spider-Man originally intended to use his powers for fame and fortune, but one day he allowed a thief to run past him. Soon after, the same criminal broke into his house intending to rob it and, when confronted, shot and killed Peter's [[Benjamin Parker|Uncle Ben]]. After chasing the killer to a warehouse and confronting him, Peter learned, to his horror, that he could have prevented the death by using his powers more responsibly.

The Burglar reappeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #170 after serving his term in prison. In issue #200 (January 1980), it is revealed that he had been seeking a large stash of money that was hidden in the Parker house, but unbeknownst to him, it had been destroyed by insects years before. When Spider-Man confronted him again (and revealed himself to be Ben Parker's nephew), the burglar was overwhelmed by fear and suffered a fatal heart attack.

He had a daughter named Jessica Carradine, a photographer who has a brief relationship with Spider-Man's clone, [[Ben Reilly]]. She believes the murder her father committed was an accident—that the gun Uncle Ben was shot with was his own, which went off by accident during a fight—and that Spider-Man had murdered him. After learning that Ben is Spider-Man, she first threatens to expose him with a photograph she took of him unmasked, but, having witnessed Ben risk his life to save innocent people in a burning skyscraper, decides against it, and gives him the photograph. 

==In other media==
===Ultimate burglar===
In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', a reimagining of the Spider-Man mythos, the origin story from ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 is reinterpreted over the course of seven issues. Ben Parker's death at the hands of the burglar does not occur until ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #4. The name "Carradine" appears on a list of "known cat burglars," but nothing else is said about it (''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #5, March 2001).

===Film===	 
In the feature film ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'', a robber [[carjack]]s Ben Parker and shoots him, rather than breaking into his house. Peter chases him to a warehouse, where the killer trips and falls from a window to his death. The movie credits list the character as "Carjacker", and he is portrayed by Michael Papajohn. Earlier in the film, Peter lets the robber escape as a subtle way of getting revenge against the fight promoter who cheated him out of money, rather than simply thinking it's "not his job" to stop him. In ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', he is identified as "Dennis Carradine". 	 

 	 

In ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', it is revealed that the carjacker, now identified as "Dennis Carradine", is not responsible for Ben Parker's death as assumed. The true killer is Flint Marko, who later becomes the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. At the climax of the film, Marko confesses to Peter that he accidentally shot Ben when he refused to give him his car. Carradine, a friend and accomplice of Marko, stole the car and left Marko behind to take the fall. Marko escaped, however, and so it was Carradine who died for the crime Marko committed. Flint Marko also admits in the movie that he needs the money he stole to help his daughter who is sick; at the end of the movie Peter/Spider-Man forgives Flint Marko.
