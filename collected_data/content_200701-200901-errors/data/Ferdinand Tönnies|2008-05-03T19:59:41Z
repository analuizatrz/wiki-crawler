'''Ferdinand Tönnies''' ([[July 26]], [[1855]], near [[Oldenswort]] ([[Eiderstedt]], [[North Frisia]]) - [[April 9]], [[1936]], [[Kiel]], [[Germany]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Sociology|sociologist]]. He was a major contributor to [[sociological theory]] and field studies, as well as bringing [[Thomas Hobbes]] back on the agenda, by publishing his manuscripts. He is best known for his distinction between two types of [[social groups]] &mdash; [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]. He was, however, a prolific writer and also co-founder of the [[German Society for Sociology]] (being its president 1909-1933, when he was ousted by the Nazis). In [[English language|English]] his name is often spelt without the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] as '''Ferdinand Toennies''', as this spelling can also be accepted in German.

==Life==
Ferdinand Tönnies was born into a wealthy farmer's family in [[Nordfriesland]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], then under [[Denmark|Danish]] rule. He studied at the universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]]. He received a doctorate in [[Tübingen]] in 1877 (with a [[Latin]] thesis on the ancient [[Siwa Oasis]]). Four years later he became a private lecturer at the [[University of Kiel]]. Because he had sympathized with the [[Hamburg]] dockers' strike of 1896, the conservative [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] government considered him to be a [[social democrat]], and Tönnies was not called to a full professorship until 1913. He held this post at the university of [[Kiel]] for only three years. He returned to the university as a [[professor emeritus]] in 1921 and taught until 1933 when he was ousted by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], due to his earlier publications that criticized them.

Tönnies, the first German sociologist proper, published over 900 works and contributed to many areas of sociology and philosophy. Many of his writings on sociological theories &mdash; including ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) &mdash; furthered pure sociology. He coined the term ''[[Voluntarism]]''. Tönnies also contributed to the study of [[social change]], particularly on [[public opinion]], [[customs]] and [[technology]], [[crime]], and [[suicide]]. He also had a vivid interest in methodology, especially [[statistics]], and sociological research, inventing his own technique of [[statistical]] association.

==Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft==
Tönnies distinguished between two types of social groupings. '''''Gemeinschaft''''' &mdash; often translated as ''[[community]]'' (or even ''gemeinschaft'')&mdash; refers to groupings based on feelings of togetherness and on mutual bonds, which are felt as a goal to be kept up, their members being means for this goal.. '''''Gesellschaft''''' &mdash; often translated as ''[[society]]'' &mdash; on the other hand, refers to groups that are sustained by it being instrumental for their members' individual aims and goals.

''Gemeinschaft'' may by exemplified historically by a [[family]] or a [[neighborhood]] in a pre-modern (rural) society; ''Gesellschaft'' by a joint-stock company or a state in a modern society, i.e. the society when Tönnies lived. ''Gesellschaft'' relationships arose in an urban and capitalist setting, characterized by [[individualism]] and impersonal monetary connections between people. Social ties were often instrumental and superficial, with selfinterest and exploitation increasingly the norm.

His distinction between social groupings is based on the assumption that there are only two basic forms of an actor's will, to approve of other men. (For Tönnies, such an approval is by no means self-evident, he is quite influenced by [[Thomas Hobbes]]) Following his "essential will" ("''Wesenwille''"), an actor will see himself as a means to serve the goals of social grouping; very often it is an underlying, [[subconscious]] force. Groupings formed around an essential will are called a ''Gemeinschaft''. The other will is the "arbitrary will" ("''Kürwille''"): An actor sees a social grouping as a means to further his individual goals; so it is purposive and future-oriented. Groupings around the latter are called ''Gesellschaft''. Whereas the membership in a ''Gemeinschaft'' is self-fulfilling, a ''Gesellschaft'' is instrumental for its members. In pure sociology &mdash; theoretically &mdash;, these two [[normal type]]s of will are to be strictly separated; in applied sociology &mdash; empirically &mdash; they are always mixed.

Tönnies’s distinction between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'', like others between tradition and modernity, has been criticized for over-generalizing differences between societies, and implying that all societies were following a similar evolutionary path, which he has never proclaimed.
