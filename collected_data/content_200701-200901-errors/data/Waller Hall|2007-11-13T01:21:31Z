Built in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style of architecture, it is currently used for administration offices and is the oldest university building west of the Mississippi in the U.S. still in use.

==History==
===Background===
Due to a variety of factors, including the deterioration of the main campus building dating from 1844 and the need for additional space, the university considered building a new building designed specifically for the university beginning in the 1850s.<ref name=Hines>Hines, Gustavus. ''Oregon and Its Institutions; Comprising a Full History of the Willamette University''. Carlton & Porter, 1868.</ref> Then on [[October 3]] [[1860]] the board of trustees for the school resolved to begin the process of building a new primary hall to be used by the [[university]].<ref name=Hines/> Reverend [[Alvin F. Waller]] was placed in charge of the efforts to raise the funds needed for a building.<ref name=Hines/> However, this was unsuccessful and on [[November 19]] [[1862]] the board again passed a resolution calling for a new structure and forming a committee of Waller, [[Gustavus Hines]], [[Josiah Lamberson Parrish]], J. Lamson, and J.H. Moores to prepare plans.<ref name=Hines/>

On [[December 2]] [[1862]], the trustees authorized [[subscriptions]] to be solicited and paid to Waller with a goal of $20,000.<ref name=Hines/> On [[May 20]] [[1863]] the board met again and learned that $12,800 had been pledged and the board then set up a building committee of Waller, Hines, Moores, E.N. Cook, and [[Thomas Milton Gatch]].<ref name=Hines/> It was mainly through the efforts of the Reverend Waller that the hall was built.<ref name=SOH>{{cite web| last = Gibby| first = Susan| title = Willamette University| publisher = Salem Online History| url = http://www.salemhistory.net/education/willamette_university.htm| accessdate =  2007-03-12}}</ref> Several designs were then considered for the new building, and on [[February 22]] [[1864]] on a vote of 16 to 1 the board selected the final plan that called for a brick building with a stone foundation.<ref name=Hines/> The foundation was to rise to a level three feet above the ground to prevent moisture from the ground seeping into the bricks.<ref name=Hines/>

===Construction===
Construction of the new building began in February of 1864 with excavation of the basement.<ref name=Hines/> This was on the north section of Willamette’s campus in downtown Salem.<ref name=eesi>{{cite web| url = http://www.eesinet.com/WillametteUniv.pdf | title = EESI: Waller Hall Renovation: Mechanical Design | accessdate = 2007-08-31}}</ref> Then on [[July 24]] [[1864]], the cornerstone of the building was laid into place in a ceremony.<ref name=Hines/> The President of the Board of Trustees, [[David Leslie (Oregon politician)|David Leslie]], laid the cornerstone of the hall.<ref name=salem>Salem Pioneer Cemetery [http://www.open.org/~pioneerc/pg26.html#LeslDavi132 David Leslie], Accessed: [[August 31]], [[2007]].</ref> This ceremony included a time capsule and a speech by [[Governor of Oregon|Governor]] [[A. C. Gibbs]].<ref name=Hines/>

All of the [[brick]]s used in the construction were fired on campus using clay excavated from the construction site in order to build the foundation.<ref name=SOH/> The builders ordered 500,000 bricks total for the construction project.<ref name=Walton>{{cite journal

The old school building, the [[Oregon Institute]], burned down in December of 1872 leaving University Hall as the only building on campus.<ref name=first>Cowger, Wright.

In [[1912]] Willamette renamed the building in honor of the Reverend Alvan F. Waller who was instrumental in getting the hall built.<ref name=SOH/> Then on [[December 17]] [[1919]], another fire swept through Waller Hall.<ref name=statesman1990/> This second fire completely gutted the five-story building, but the exterior walls remained intact.<ref name=WU/> The Mansard roof and square tower were destroyed in the fire.<ref name=statesman1990/> The university rebuilt the hall the following year, and used the original plans that included the round cupola but omitted the Mansard style roof and the square [[tower]] topping the structure.<ref name=SOH/>

From November of 1987 to November of 1989 the 25,000-square-foot building went through a $2.26 million [[renovation]].<ref name=eesi/> This renovation addressed interior issues with the building including [[seismic]] upgrades in the event of a large magnitude earthquake.<ref name=renovation2005>De Carbonel, Dan.
