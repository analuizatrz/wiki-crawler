'''Stuart Fergusson Victor Sutcliffe''' ([[23 June]] [[1940]] &ndash; [[10 April]] [[1962]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[musician]] and [[artist]] who, until his early [[death]], worked in a [[style]] related to [[Abstract Expressionism]]. 

Sutcliffe was an art school friend of [[John Lennon]] and was the original [[bassist]] of the English [[rock band]] [[The Beatles]] for two years. Sutcliffe and Lennon are credited with naming the group after [[Buddy Holly]]'s band [[the Crickets]]. Sutcliffe enrolled in the [[Hamburg]] College of Art after leaving The Beatles and studied under future [[pop art|pop artist]] [[Eduardo Paolozzi]]. 

Sutcliffe met [[photographer]] [[Astrid Kirchherr]] in [[Hamburg]] whilst playing there, and they were later [[engaged]]. Sutcliffe is often referred to as "[[Fifth Beatle|the Fifth Beatle]]".
==Early years==
[[Image:Sutcliffeselfportrait.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Sutcliffe's self-portrait.]]
Sutcliffe's father, Charles Sutcliffe, was a [[Navy|naval officer]]—who was often at [[sea]] during his son's early years.  His mother, Millie, was a schoolteacher. Sutcliffe had a younger sister named Pauline.

A small but delicately handsome boy, Sutcliffe was born at the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion Hospital in [[1940]], in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] and brought up in the St Johns area of [[Huyton]], [[Merseyside]] in [[England]], attending the [[Prescot Grammar School]].<ref name="Spitzp105"> Spitz 2005. p105</ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/young.asp Prescot Grammar School uniform] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> Sutcliffe sang in the local church choir in [[Huyton]].<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/choir.asp  Photo of Sutcliffe in church choir] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> When Sutcliffe's father did return home on leave, he invited his son and Rod Murray (Sutcliffe's room-mate) for a "real good [[Alcoholic beverage|booze-up]]" and slipped £10 into Sutcliffe's pocket before disappearing for another six months.<ref name="Spitzp105"> Spitz 2005. p105</ref>

Sutcliffe met John Lennon when they were both studying at the [[Liverpool College of Art]]. According to Lennon, Sutcliffe had a "marvellous art portfolio" at the age of fourteen and was a seriously talented painter who was one the "stars" of the school.<ref name="Spitzp105"> Spitz 2005. p105</ref><ref name="Spitzp107"> Spitz 2005. p107</ref> 
 
Sutcliffe lived in Percy Street before moving to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace, which was occupied by [[Beatniks]].<ref name="Spitzp172"> Spitz 2005. p172</ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/painting.asp  Painting by Sutcliffe in Percy Street flat] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> The flat was near the new [[Liverpool Cathedral|Anglican Cathedral]] in the run-down area of Liverpool 8, with bare lightbulbs and a mattress on the floor in the corner. Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960.<ref name="Milesp50"> Miles 1998. p50</ref><ref name=" CynthiaJohnp63"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p63</ref> 

After talking to Sutcliffe one night at the Cashbah Coffee Club -—owned by [[Pete Best]]'s mother, Mona Best —- Lennon and [[Paul McCartney]] persuaded Sutcliffe to buy a [[Höfner]] 500/5 model, known in [[Europe]] as a ''President'' bass.<ref>[http://www.rockmine.com/Stu2.html Sutcliffe's President Bass] rockmine.com - Retrieved: 9 May 2007 </ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/cheque.asp  Sutcliffe's cheque book -] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> Sutcliffe's fingers would often be blistered during long rehearsals, as he had never played long enough for his fingers to become [[callus|calloused]], although he had previously played acoustic guitar.<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp64"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p64</ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/guitar.asp  Sutcliffe’s first guitar] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> Sutcliffe started acting as a [[booking agent]] for the group, and they often used his flat as a rehearsal room.<ref name="Milesp50"> Miles 1998. p50</ref>

In July of 1960, the British Sunday newspaper ''[[The People]]'' ran an article entitled, "The Beatnik Horror", which featured a photograph taken in the flat below Sutcliffe's, with a teenaged Lennon lying on the floor. [[Allan Williams]] had set up the photograph.  He took over from Sutcliffe booking concerts for "[[The Silver Beetles]]", as they were then known, which was Lennon, McCartney and Sutcliffe.<ref name="Milesp53"> Miles 1998. p53</ref> The Beatles' subsequent name-change came from an afternoon in the Renshaw Hall bar when Sutcliffe, Lennon, and [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia Powell]] thought up names similar to Buddy Holly's band, [[The Crickets]], and came up with ''The Beatals''.<ref name="Spitzp175"> Spitz 2005. p175</ref> Lennon later changed the name to "The Beatles", because he thought it sounded French  and suggested ''Le Beat'', or ''Beat-less''.<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp65"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p65</ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/exhibitions/stewartbale/livemusic.asp Renshaw Hall bar] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk - Retrieved: 9 May 2007 </ref>

==The Beatles and Hamburg==

Sutcliffe's playing style was elementary, mostly sticking to [[root note]]s of [[Chord (music)|chords]].<ref name="Spitzp184-185"> Spitz 2005. pp184-185</ref> Bill Harry, founder and editor of the ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' newspaper, complained to Sutcliffe that he should be concentrating on art and not music, as he thought that Sutcliffe was a competent but not brilliant [[bassist]].<ref name="Spitzp173-174"> Spitz 2005. pp173-174</ref> While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles biographies as appearing very uncomfortable onstage, and as often playing with his back to the audience, Pete Best denies this, recalling Sutcliffe as usually good-natured and "animated" before an audience.<ref>[http://www.rickresource.com/rrp/petebest.html An Evening With Pete Best, Part I: The Interview] rickresource.com -  Retrieved: 20 Jan, 2007</ref> McCartney has said that Sutcliffe was a typical art student, with bad skin and [[Acne vulgaris|pimples]], although in Hamburg, his stature grew after he began wearing dark [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|Ray-Ban]] sunglasses and tight trousers.<ref name="Milesp65"> Miles 1998. p65</ref> 

On [[5 December]] [[1960]], [[George Harrison]] was sent back to England for being under-age.  McCartney and Best were deported for attempted arson at the [[Bruno Koschmider|Bambi Kino]], which left Lennon and Sutcliffe in Hamburg.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage93"> Cynthia Lennon “John” 2006. p93.</ref><ref name="BeatlesTimeline">[http://beatles.ncf.ca/timeline.html#60  The BeatlesTimeline] beatles.ncf.ca - Retrieved: 9 May 2007 </ref> Lennon took a train home, but as Sutcliffe had a [[Common cold|cold]] he stayed in Hamburg.<ref name="Spitzp230"> Spitz 2005. p230</ref> Sutcliffe later borrowed airfare money from Astrid Kirchherr in order to fly  to Liverpool in early January of 1961, though he returned to Hamburg in March with the other Beatles.<ref name="Spitzp242"> Spitz 2005. p242</ref>

At that point, Sutcliffe lent Paul McCartney his President bass until the latter could earn enough money to buy a bass guitar of his own.  Sutcliffe asked McCartney not to change the strings around, so McCartney had to play it upside down.<ref name="Milesp74-75"> Miles 1998. pp74-75</ref> In 1967, The Beatles included a photo of Sutcliffe among those on the cover of the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album (he appears at the extreme left, next to fellow-artist [[Aubrey Beardsley]]).

[[Image:Sutcliffe and Kirchherr.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Sutcliffe and Kirchherr in 1960.]]
Kirchherr was raised by her [[widowed]] mother, Nielsa Kirchherr, in Eimsbütteler Strasse in the wealthy Hamburg [[suburb]] of [[Altona]].<ref name="Milesp64"> Miles 1998. p64</ref> Sutcliffe met Kirchherr in the Kaiserkeller club, where she went to watch The Beatles perform. After a photo session with them, Kirchherr invited the group to her mother's house for tea and showed them her bedroom, decorated in all black —- including the furniture -— with silver foil on the walls, and a large tree branch hanging from the ceiling. Sutcliffe began dating Kirchherr shortly thereafter.<ref name="Spitzp224"> Spitz 2005. p224</ref>

Sutcliffe wrote to friends that he was infatuated with Kirchherr, and asked her friends which colours, films, books, and painters she liked. Pete Best commented that the beginning of their relationship was, "like one of those fairy stories".<ref name="Spitzp225"> Spitz 2005. p225</ref> Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November, 1960, and exchanged rings, as is the German custom.<ref name="Milesp65"> Miles 1998. p65</ref> Sutcliffe wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr, something they were shocked to learn, as they assumed he would give up his career as an artist.<ref name="Spitzp235"> Spitz 2005. p235</ref> 

Kirchherr and Sutcliffe traveled to Liverpool in the summer of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family and to see his home city before their marriage.<ref name="Spitzp278"> Spitz 2005. p278</ref>

==Death==
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages.  -->
Stuart Sutcliffe collapsed in the middle of an art class in Hamburg. Nielsa Kirchherr had German doctors perform various tests, but they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the intense headaches from which he'd been suffering. Whilst living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg, his condition grew steadily worse. After collapsing again, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital by Kirchherr (who rode with him in the ambulance), but he died before  reaching the hospital.<ref name="Spitzp305"> Spitz 2005. p305</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp110"> Cynthia Lennon– “John”. p110.</ref>

On the [[13 April]] [[1962]], Kirchherr met The Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them that Sutcliffe had died from a [[cerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]] a few days before.<ref name="Spitzp305"> Spitz 2005. p305</ref><ref name="BeatlesTimeline"/>

It has never been known precisely what caused the brain hemorrhage that took Sutcliffe's life. Some believe that the cause was an earlier [[head injury]], sustained outside [[Lathom|Lathom Hall]] after a live performance in January of 1961 (although Sutcliffe had been beaten up before).<ref name="Spitzp240"> Spitz 2005. p240</ref> According to former manager [[Allan Williams]], Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe's aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe sustained a fractured skull in the fight, and Lennon broke his little finger.<ref name="Spitzp241"> Spitz 2005. p241</ref> 

Sutcliffe had refused medical attention at the time (and had not kept an X-ray appointment at the Sefton General Hospital).  He saw a a doctor only months later in Germany, when he began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/letter3.asp  Sefton General Hospital report] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> Kirchherr said later that some of the headaches left Sutcliffe temporarily blind.<ref name="Spitzp278"> Spitz 2005. p278</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp110"> Cynthia Lennon– “John”. p110.</ref> 

After Sutcliffe's death, Kirchherr wrote a letter to Millie Sutcliffe, apologising for being too ill to attend his funeral in Liverpool and saying how much she and Lennon missed him: {{cquote | Oh mum he [Lennon] is in a terrible mood now, he just can't believe that darling Stuart never comes back. He just crying his eyes out John is marvellous to me, he says that he know Stuart so much and he love him so much that he can understand me."<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/letter4.asp Astrid’s letter to Millie Sutcliffe] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref>}}

==Art==
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages.  -->
[[Image:Sutcliffe painting.jpg|thumb|right|''Hamburg Painting no. 2'']]Sutcliffe displayed artistic talent at an early age.<ref name="Spitzp105"> Spitz 2005. p105</ref><ref name=" CynthiaJohnp47"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p47</ref> Helen Anderson (a fellow student) remembered his early works as being very aggressive, with dark moody colours, which was not the type of painting she expected from such a quiet student.<ref name="Spitzp107"> Spitz 2005. p107</ref>  

One of Sutcliffe's paintings was shown at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in Liverpool as part of the [[John Moores (merchant)|John Moores]] exhibition from November 1959 until January 1960. After the exhibition, John Moores bought Sutcliffe's canvas for £75, which was then equal to 6-7 weeks' wages for an average working man.<ref name="Milesp50"> Miles 1998. p50</ref>

After meeting Kirchherr, Sutcliffe decided to leave The Beatles and enrolled at the Hamburg College of Art in June 1961, under the tutelage of Paolozzi who respected Sutcliffe's talent, and later wrote a report stating that although Sutcliffe had missed some lessons because of illness, he was considered by Paolozzi to be one of his "best students".<ref name="Milesp65"> Miles 1998. p65</ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/idcard.asp Hamburg identity card, 1961] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/report.asp  Eduardo Paolozzi’s Report] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> 

Sutcliffe's few surviving works reveal influence from the British and [[European]] abstract artists contemporary with the Abstract Expressionist movement in the [[United States]]. His earlier figurative work is reminiscent of the [[kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink school]], particularly of [[John Bratby]], though Sutcliffe was producing abstract work by the end of the 1950s, including ''The Summer Painting'', purchased by Moores. Rod Murray remembered that the painting was painted on a board, not a canvas, and had to be cut into two pieces (because of its size) and hinged. Murray added that only one of the pieces actually got to the exhibition but sold nonetheless.<ref name="Spitzp168"> Spitz 2005. p168</ref>

Sutcliffe's works bear some comparison with those of John Hoyland and [[Nicolas de Staël]], though they are more lyrical. His later works are typically untitled, constructed from heavily impastoed slabs of pigment in the manner of de Staël, and overlaid with scratched or squeezed linear elements creating enclosed spaces. ''Hamburg Painting no. 2'' was purchased by Liverpool's [[Walker Art Gallery]] and is one of a series entitled "''Hamburg''" in which the surface and color changes produced atmospheric energy. European artists (including Paolozzi) were influencing Sutcliffe at the time.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/sutcliffe.asp  'Hamburg Painting No. 2' 1961] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 12 May 2007 </ref> The Walker Art Gallery has other works by Sutcliffe, which are "''Self-portrait''" (in charcoal) and "''The Crucifixion''".<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/portrait.asp Sutcliffe's self-portrait (in charcoal)] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/exhibitions/beatles/art/sutcliffecrucifixion.asp “The Crucifixion” by Sutcliffe] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 12 May 2007 </ref>

Lennon later hung a pair of Sutcliffe's paintings in his house ([[Kenwood, St. George's Hill|Kenwood]]) in Weybridge. McCartney had a Paolozzi sculpture in his Cavendish Avenue home.<ref name="Milesp170"> Miles 1998. p170</ref><ref name="Milesp258"> Miles 1998. p258</ref>

==Anthology 1==
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages.  -->
The Beatles' compilation album ''[[Anthology 1]]'', consisting mostly of previously unreleased recordings from the band's early years, was released in 1995. Sutcliffe is pictured on the front cover, as he was on ''Sgt. Pepper'' 28 years before.  More importantly, he is featured playing bass with the Beatles on three songs that the band recorded in 1960: "Hallelujah, I Love Her So", "[[You'll Be Mine]]", and "[[Cayenne (song)|Cayenne]]". These songs are, to date, the only officially sanctioned recordings of Sutcliffe playing with the Beatles.

Sutcliffe's role in the Beatles' early career, as well as the factors that led him to leave the group, is dramatised in the film ''[[Backbeat (movie)|Backbeat]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Stephen Dorff]]. He was also portrayed by David Wilkinson in the film ''[[Birth of the Beatles]]'' and by Lee Williams in ''In My Life: The John Lennon Story'' (2000).
