Father '''Ferdinand Verbiest''' ([[October 9]] [[1623]] – [[January 28]] [[1688]]) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] in [[China]]. He is known as Nan Huairen (南懷仁) in Chinese.

Born at [[Pittem]] near [[Kortrijk]], Belgium, he studied in [[Leuven]], [[Mechelen]], [[Sevilla]] and [[Rome]]. He entered the [[Society of Jesus]] on [[September 2]] [[1641]]. In 1658 he accompanied Father [[Martino Martini]] to [[China]] and reached [[Macao]] in [[1659]]. He led the mission in [[Shanxi]] until 1660, when he was called to assist, and later replace, Father [[Adam Schall von Bell]] in Beijing in his work in [[astronomy]]. Beside his work in astronomy, he also experimented with steam. He developed a little steam propelled trolley at around 1670, possibly the first steam powered "car".
He died in [[Beijing]] and was succeeded as the chief mathematician and astronomer of the Chinese empire by another [[Belgian]] Jesuit, [[Antoine Thomas]] (1644-1709). His remains were buried near those of [[Matteo Ricci]] on [[March 11]], [[1688]].

Verbiest was the only Westerner in Chinese history to ever receive the honour of a posthumous name by the Emperor.
