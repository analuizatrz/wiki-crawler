Gunston Hall is believed to be designed by William Buckland, a carpenter/joiner and [[indentured servant]] from England. Buckland later went on to design a number of fine buildings in Virginia and Maryland. Both he and William Bernard Sears, another indentured servant, are believed to have created the fancy woodwork and interior carving. Gunston's interior design combines elements of [[rococo]], [[chinoiserie]], and [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] styles, an unusual contrast the tendency for simple decoration in Virginia at this time.<ref name="GHPfirstfloor">{{cite web

== First floor ==
[[Image:Gunston-Hall-main-passage.jpg|thumb|300px|Central passage]]
The first floor of the house is divided in two by a central passage, leading from a door in the front to a door in the back, with a staircase running up on the left side. On the left of the central passage is the primary chamber (or bedroom) in the front, and the little parlour in the back. Between the primary chamber and the little parlour is a smaller passage, leading to a service staircase and a small, side stairway. According to the Gunston Hall Plantation official website, on the right side of the house is a parlour in the front, and a dining room in the back.<ref name="GHPfirstfloor" /> According to the Historic American Buildings Survey (part of the US National Park Service), on the right side of the house the dining room is in the front and the palladian room is in the back.<ref name="HABSfirstfloor">

The central passage is lined by six symmetrical [[Doric order|Doric]]-style pilasters. A double arch, with a carved pine cone, divides the front of the passage from the back. In the front, there are 4 doors placed opposite each other, although one is a fake door for symmetry. The front of the hall is covered in wallpaper, while the back has raised painted panelling.<ref name="GHPpassage">

The primary chamber was a private, non-public room, and was less ornate than the public rooms. Towards the end of Mason's life, it was painted in emerald green, which was considered a desirable colour. The windows had pocket shutters, and are also believed to be the only windows in the house to have curtains during Mason's lifetime.<ref name="GHPchamber">

The little parlour was also non-public, and decorated plainly. The walls were painted a neutral grey. Above the fireplace was a split pediment overmantel (a rectangle, and a partial triangle above that). During Mason's lifetime, the rectangle would have contained either a painting or a mirror. On either side of the fireplace are deep-shelved beaufats (niches) to store and display the tableware, with doors to secure valuable possessions.<ref name="GHPlittleparlor">

[[Image:Gunston-Hall-front.jpg|thumb|300px|Gunston Hall in May 2006, seen from the front]]
The parlor, according to the Gunston Hall Plantation official website (the dining room according to the Historic American Buildings Survey),<ref name="HABSfirstfloor" /> was a public, ornately decorated room. The walls are painted a yellow ochre, and the woodwork is Chinese-style. The wall of the fireplace has a mantel decorated with [[fretwork]], pagoda-like scalloped mouldings, as well as canopies topped by pine cone finials. Above the doors are similar canopies, which might have displayed Chinese porcelain vases or ceramic figures. The two long windows are topped by scalloped pediments, decorated with fretwork. During Mason's lifetime, 3 of the walls were probably wallpapered. During the 1700s, chinoese (Chinese-style) design was popular in Great Britain, however no other rooms with [[chinoiserie]] woodwork are known to have existed in colonial America.<ref name="GHPparlor" />

The dining room, according to the Gunston Hall Plantation official website (the palladian room according to the Historic American Buildings Survey),<ref name="HABSfirstfloor" /> was also public, and was the most elaborately decorated in the house. The classical woodwork shows touches of the fashionable [[Rococo#Architecture|rococo]] design. The fireplace wall has an ornate chimney breast. On either side of the fireplace are beaufats, these ones with shallower shelves than in the little parlour, and no doors. Classical broken pediments top the chimney breast and the beaufats. The floor is comprised carefully matched blind-dowelled planks, an expensive feature. Egg-and-dart carved patterns surround the black-walnut entry doors. During Mason's lifetime, painted or decorated paper covered the thin pine panelling on the walls. The two windows look out onto Mason's garden.<ref name="GHPdiningroom">

== Second floor ==
[[Image:Gunston-Hall-back.jpg|thumb|300px|Gunston Hall in May 2006, seen from the back looking through the garden]]
Unlike other 18th century houses of Gunston Hall's stature, the layout of the second floor is unlike the layout of the floor below. A narrow passage runs sideways through the upper level, leading to seven bedchambers and a storage room. At the top of the main stairway is a tri-part arch with fluted pillars, separating the passageway from a small gallery overlooking the staircase. The smaller service staircase comes up opposite the storage room.<ref name="GHPsecondfloor">

}}</ref>

Of the bedchambers, the four corner rooms were considered the nicest. Each of the four corner bedchambers had a fireplace. Their fireplaces and surrounds did have some architectural detail. The corner rooms had two or three instead of one, which is all the inner bedchambers had. The walls of the corner bedchambers were painted with more expensive shades, such as Prussian blue or verdigris. The attic could be accessed through one of the inner bedrooms.<ref name="GHPsecondfloor" />

The storage closet, or lumber room, had no exterior window, but instead received light from a window to the stairwell, as there was an exterior window above the staircase landing.<ref name="GHPsecondfloor" />

== Basement ==
Gunston Hall also has a basement, which has a main passage and four rooms like the floor above it. Three staircases lead down to the basement. The basement contains four brick arched chimney supports, and nine small windows.<ref name=HABSbasement>

== Garden ==
[[Image:Gunston South View LOC.jpg|thumb|300px|View of garden from Gunston Hall looking southwards from a second floor window]]
The garden was located behind the house, or on the southern side. The garden was grown above a man-made level platform where there used to be a hill, and was exactly one acre in area. A gravel path runs from the back of the house to the southern edge, and was 12 feet wide during Mason's time period, the same width as the central passage in the house and the portico. Today, the path is narrower, crowded by boxwoods that are now about 250 years old. The path ends in an overlook extending out from the steep edge of the garden. From here, the Potomac river can be seen. The view would have probably been more impressive during Mason's time, when the trees were cleared. The garden was most likely broken into four rectangles, with additional gravel paths running through and around it. The rectangles closer to the house were probably shorter than the rectangles further away, in order to give the illusion from the house of all rectangles being the same size.<ref name="GHPgarden">

== Outbuildings ==

The outbuildings currently at Gunston Hall are reconstructed. They include a kitchen, dairy, smokehouse, and laundry. They are believed to be representative of typical support buildings for an 18th century plantation household.<ref name="GHPvisiting">
