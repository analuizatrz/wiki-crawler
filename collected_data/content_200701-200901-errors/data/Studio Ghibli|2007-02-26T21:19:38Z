{{nihongo|'''Studio Ghibli Inc.'''|株式会社スタジオジブリ|Kabushiki-gaisha Sutajio Jiburi}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[animation]] [[film studio]], and previously was a subsidiary of [[Tokuma Shoten]]. Its  provocative and emotional [[anime]] films are widely praised all over the world. Its name derives from the nickname the [[Italy|Italians]] used for their [[Sahara]]n scouting planes in the [[Second World War]], which derived from the Libyan word for ''hot [[wind]] blowing through the [[Sahara Desert]]'' (also known as [[sirocco]]). Though the term is Italian, the Japanese pronunciation of the studio's name is ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ˌdʲʑbɹiː] or [ˌdʲʑbɝi]}}) ''{{Audio|Ghibli.ogg|listen}}''. The theory behind the name was that the studio was blowing a new wind into the Japanese anime industry. The company's logo features the character Totoro from the film ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''.

==History==
Founded in 1985, it is headed by the acclaimed director [[Hayao Miyazaki]] along with his colleague and mentor [[Isao Takahata]], as well as the studio's executive managing director and long-time producer [[Toshio Suzuki]]. Its origins date back to [[1983]], with the film ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind]]'', which was popularised as a serialized [[manga]] in a publication of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s [[Animage]] magazine after the original screenplay was rejected. The film was eventually produced by Topcraft and the film's success spurred the formation of Ghibli. Tokuma is the parent company of Studio Ghibli, and has provided [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] with the video rights to eight of the films and global distribution rights to ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and ''[[Spirited Away]]''. Miyazaki's latest film, ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'', was actually based on a book by British author [[Diana Wynne Jones]], published in several countries including Canada and the United States. Composer [[Joe Hisaishi]] has provided the soundtrack for all of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films.

The most famous and lauded film from the studio that was not directed by Miyazaki is ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'', directed by [[Isao Takahata]], a sad film focusing on the lives of two war orphans towards the end of [[Second World War]] in Japan.  

Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine [[Animage]], which regularly runs exclusive articles about the studio and its members in a section titled "Ghibli Notes." Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works frequently graces the cover of the magazine. 

The company is well-known for its strict "no-edits" policy in licensing their films abroad. This has stemmed from the disastrous dubbing of Miyazaki's ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind]]'' when the film was released in the [[United States]] as ''Warriors of the Wind'' (it was heavily edited and [[Americanized]]). There is a rumor that when licensing ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', Miyazaki mailed Miramax a samurai sword with a note reading "no cuts", to underline their "no-editing" policy.

[[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], at a Studio Ghibli press conference on [[2007-01-17]], indicated that the title of the next Miyazaki film would be announced in March 2007.<ref>{{ja icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2007/01/17/06.html|title=製作中ジブリ次回作３月に発表|publisher=Sponichi|date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref>
