'''Patrick "Spike" Cairn Hughes''' (1908-1987) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[jazz]] [[musician]], [[composer]] and [[music journalist]]. He was the son of Irish composer, writer and song collector [[Herbert Hughes (musicologist)|Herbert Hughes]]. Hughes was a multi-dimensional musician, playing the [[double bass]], composing [[opera]]tic scores, arranging jazz recordings and writing books on topics ranging from [[gardening]] to [[Toscanini]]'s music. 

Hughes' small recording group was one of the earliest artists signed to [[Decca Records]] in England, spanning the period from 1929 to 1933, culminating in his visit to [[New York City]] where he arranged three historic recording sessions involving members of [[Benny Carter]]'s and [[Luis Russell]]'s orchestras with [[Coleman Hawkins]] and [[Henry "Red" Allen]] from [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band.  These 14 legendary sides were mostly Hughes' own compositions. Though not released in the U.S. at the time, they have become known as classic jazz masterworks.
