'''''The Guardian''''' is a [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British]] [[newspaper]] owned by the [[Guardian Media Group]]. It is published Monday to Saturday in the [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] format. Until 1959 it was called '''''The Manchester Guardian''''', which reflected its origins; the paper is rarely still referred to by this name &ndash; except in [[North America]], where the old name is sometimes used (to distinguish it from [[Guardian|other newspapers with similar names]]). The newspaper's main offices and printing centres are located in [[London]] and [[Manchester]].

''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'', which circulates worldwide, provides a compact digest of four newspapers. It contains articles from ''The Guardian'' and its Sunday paper, ''[[The Observer]]'', as well as reports, features and book reviews from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and articles translated from France's ''[[Le Monde]]''.

==Stance==
[[Editorial]] articles in ''The Guardian'' are generally in sympathy with the middle-ground liberal to left-wing end of the political spectrum. This is reflected in the paper's readership: a MORI Poll taken between April and June 2000 showed that 80% of ''Guardian'' readers were Labour Party voters (cited in ''[[International Socialism (journal)|International Socialism]]'' Spring 2003, ISBN 1-898876-97-5); according to another [[MORI]] poll taken in 2004, 44% of ''Guardian'' readers vote [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and 37% vote [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]].<ref>MORI, 2005-03-09. "[http://www.mori.com/polls/2004/voting-by-readership.shtml Voting Intention by Newspaper Readership]"</ref>

Whilst in the British political context the Guardian is considered centre-left, from a US political perspective it is frequently described as "[[left-wing]]".<ref> http://thebrowser.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/ </ref><ref> http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4730959/The-Guardian-Britain-s-leading.html </ref> This is in keeping with the way in which the centre-of-gravity of the US political spectrum is substantially further to the right than in Europe.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

==Format==
Today ''The Guardian'' is the only British national newspaper to publish in full colour (although the edition printed in [[Northern Ireland]] still has much black-and-white content <ref>{{cite web

''The Guardian'' had a certified average [[newspaper circulation|daily circulation]] of 355,750 copies as of August 2007 &ndash; a drop of 5.94% on the first month of the year; as compared to sales of 887,664 for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 638,820 for ''[[The Times]]'', and 239,834 for ''[[The Independent]]''.<ref>Audit Bureau of Circulations Ltd - abc.org.uk</ref>

==Awards==
It has been awarded the ''National Newspaper of the Year'' in 1999 and 2006 by the [[British Press Awards]], as well as being co-winner of the ''World's Best-designed Newspaper'' as awarded by the [[Society for News Design]] (2006). The ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' website won the Best Newspaper category two years running in the 2005 and 2006 [[Webby Awards]], beating (in 2005) the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref>The Webby Awards, 2005. "[http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php#webby_entry_newspaper 9th Annual Webby Awards nominations and winners]."</ref> It has been the winner for six years in a row of the [[British Press Awards]] for Best Electronic Daily Newspaper.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newspaperawards.co.uk/default.htm | title=The 2006 Newspaper Awards | accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref> The site won an ''[[Editor & Publisher|Eppy]]'' award from the US-based magazine ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'' in 2000 for the best-designed newspaper online service.<ref>Eppy Awards, 2000. "[http://royal.reliaserve.com/eppy/winners2000.html Winners]."</ref> The website is known for its commentary on sporting events, particularly its over-by-over cricket commentary.

In 2007 it was ranked first in a study on transparency which analysed 25 mainstream English-language media vehicles, and which was conducted by the prestigious [[International Center for Media and the Public Agenda]] of the [[University of Maryland]]. It got a nearly perfect score.

==Ownership==
''The Guardian'' is part of the GMG [[Guardian Media Group]] of newspapers, radio stations, and print media including ''[[The Observer]]'' Sunday newspaper, the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', ''[[Money Observer]]'' financial magazine, ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'' International newspaper, ''[[Guardian Monthly]]'' magazine, and new media &ndash; [[Guardian Abroad]] website, and ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'', one of the most popular online news resources on the Internet.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} All the aforementioned are owned by [[Scott Trust|The Scott Trust]], a charitable foundation which aims to ensure the newspaper's [[editorial independence]] in perpetuity, maintaining its financial health to ensure it does not become vulnerable to take over by for-profit media groups, and the serious compromise of editorial independence that this often brings.

''The Guardian'' has been consistently loss-making. The National Newspaper division of GMG, which also includes ''The Observer'', reported operating losses of £49.9m in 2006, up from £18.6m in 2005.<ref>Guardian Media Group plc 2006. "[http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/gmgplc/media/news/article/article110.html Guardian Media Group 2005/6 results]."</ref> The paper is therefore heavily dependent on cross-subsidisation from profitable companies within the group, including [[Auto Trader]] and the ''Manchester Evening News''.

''The Guardian'''s ownership by the Scott Trust is likely a factor in it being the only British national daily to conduct (since 2003) an annual social, ethical and environmental [[audit]] in which it examines, under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor, its own behaviour as a company.<ref>Guardian Newspapers Ltd & Scott Trust, 2005. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit Social, ethical and environmental audit, 2005]".</ref> It is also the only British daily national newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman (called the ‘readers' editor’) to handle complaints and corrections.

''The Guardian'' and its parent groups participate in [[Project Syndicate]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/ | title=Project Syndicate | accessdate=2006-04-04}}</ref> established by [[George Soros]], and intervened in 1995 to save the ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' in [[South Africa]], but Guardian Media Group sold the majority of its shares in the ''Mail & Guardian'' in 2002.

==History==
===Political alignment and controversies===
[[Image:GuardianNewsroom.jpg|thumb|right|''The Guardian'''s Newsroom visitor centre and archive (No 60), with an old sign with the name ''The Manchester Guardian'']]
The ''Manchester Guardian'' was founded in Manchester in 1821 by a group of [[non-conformist]] businessmen headed by [[John E. Taylor|John Edward Taylor]]. The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that "it will zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty … it will warmly advocate the cause of Reform; it will endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy; and to support, without reference to the party from which they emanate, all serviceable measures." According to a December, 2004 survey, 44% of Guardian readers voted in favour of Labour, 37% for the Liberal Democrats and only 5% for the Conservatives, the lowest percentage of any large British newspaper.<ref name="MORI survey">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/polls/2004/voting-by-readership.shtml|title=MORI survey of newspaper readers|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref>

Its most famous editor, [[Charles Prestwich Scott|C P Scott]], made the ''Manchester Guardian'' into a nationally famous newspaper. He was editor for 57 years from 1872, and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor's son in 1907. Under Scott the paper's moderate editorial line became more radical, supporting Gladstone when the Liberals split in 1886, and opposing the [[Second Boer War]] against popular opinion.

Scott's friendship with [[Chaim Weizmann]] played a role in the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]], and in 1948 the ''Guardian'' was a supporter of the State of [[Israel]]. Daphna Baram tells the story of the ''Guardian'''s relationship with the [[zionist]] movement and Israel in the book "''Disenchantment: The Guardian and Israel''".<ref>{{cite book | title=Disenchantment: The ''Guardian'' and Israel | author=Daphna Baram | authorlink=Daphna Baram | publisher=Politico | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-84275-119-0}}</ref>

In June 1936 ownership of the paper passed to the [[Scott Trust]] (named after the last owner, John Russell Scott, who was the first chairman of the Trust). This move ensured the paper's independence, and it was then noted for its eccentric style, its moralising and its detached attitude to its finances.

Traditionally affiliated with the centrist [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], and with a northern, [[non-conformist]] circulation base, the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. With the pro-[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] ''[[News Chronicle]]'', the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-supporting ''[[Daily Herald]]'', the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]]'s ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and several Sunday and weekly papers, it supported the 'Republican' government against General [[Francisco Franco]]'s insurgent '[[nationalists]]'. Consistent in its anti-establishment stance, the Guardian also provided one of the few probing and dissenting voices during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].

===After 1959===
In 1983 the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of [[cruise missiles]] in Britain that were leaked to the Guardian by civil servant [[Sarah Tisdall]]. ''The Guardian'' eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities, which resulted in a prison sentence for Tisdall.

In 1995, both the [[Granada Television]] programme ''[[World In Action]]'' and ''The Guardian'' were sued for [[libel]] by the then cabinet minister [[Jonathan Aitken]], for their allegation that the [[Saudi]] Prince [[Mohammed bin Fahd]] had paid for Aitken and his wife to stay at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Hôtel Ritz]] in [[Paris]], which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on Aitken's part. Aitken publicly stated he would fight with "the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play".<ref>Jonathan Aitken, 1995. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/aitken/Story/0,2763,208516,00.html The simple sword of truth]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> The court case proceeded, and in 1997 ''The Guardian'' produced evidence that Aitken's claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue.<ref>Luke Harding and David Pallister, 1997 "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/aitken/Story/0,2763,208503,00.html He lied and lied and lied]" ''The Guardian''.</ref> In 1999, Aitken was jailed for [[perjury]] and [[perverting the course of justice]].<ref>BBC News, 1999. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/258070.stm Aitken pleads guilty to perjury]."</ref>

In the early 2000s the newspaper challenged the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]].<ref>Clare Dyer, 06 December 2000. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,,407460,00.html A challenge to the crown: now is the time for change]" ''The Guardian''</ref><ref>Nicholas Watt, 07 December 2000. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,,407917,00.html Broad welcome for debate on monarchy]" ''The Guardian''</ref>

During the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] wars ''The Guardian'' attracted a significant proportion of anti-war readers as one of the mass-media outlets most critical of UK and USA military initiatives.

Despite its early support for the Zionist movement, in recent decades ''The Guardian'' has often been perceived as critical of Israeli government policy. In December 2003 journalist [[Julie Burchill]] left the paper for ''[[The Times]]'', citing this as one of the reasons for her move.<ref>Julie Burchill, 29 November 2003. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1094420,00.html Good bad and ugly]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>she later  accused The Guardian of being anti semitic.<ref>"The Guardian, the newspaper I left some years ago in protest at what I saw as its vile anti-Semitism."[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/749291.html]</ref>
In a recent controversy, the paper has been accused by Harvard lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] of bias and an unwillngness to correct what he deemed a mis-statement of fact.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/1136739501.html?dids=1136739501:1136739501&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+28%2C+2006&author=ALAN+DERSHOWITZ&pub=Jerusalem+Post&edition=&startpage=16&desc=%27The+Guardian%27+at+the+crossroads | title='The Guardian' at the crossroads | publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=September 27, 2006}}</ref> This allegation was denied by the Guardian's foreign editor, Harriet Sherwood, who says the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the Israel-Palestine conflict.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit/story/0,,1931208,00.html | title=News coverage | publisher=The Guardian |date=October 25, 2006}}</ref> On [[6 June]] [[2007]] the paper commemorated the 40th anniversary of the [[Six Day War]] by giving equal space to the Israeli and Palestinian prime ministers to explain their views on the conflict and its legacy. <ref>Ismail Haniyeh, 6 June 2007.

In August 2004, for the [[US presidential election, 2004|US presidential election]], the daily ''G2'' supplement launched an experimental letter-writing campaign in [[Clark County, Ohio|Clark County]], [[Ohio]], a small county in a [[swing state]]. ''G2'' editor Ian Katz bought a voter list from the county for $25 and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election and, giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of making the correct decision. There was something of a [[backlash]] to this campaign. The paper scrapped ''Operation Clark County'' on [[21 October]], [[2004]] after first publishing a column of vituperation under the headline 'Dear Limey assholes'.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1329858,00.html]

In October 2004 ''The Guardian'' published a humour column by [[Charlie Brooker]] in its entertainment guide, which appeared to call for the assassination of US President [[George W. Bush]].<ref>CNS News, 25 October 2004."[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200410%5CPOL20041025a.html Left-Wing UK Paper Pulls Bush Assassination Column]."</ref> This caused some controversy and the paper was forced to issue an apology and remove the article from its website.<ref>Charlie Brooker, 24 October 2004."[http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguide/tvradio/story/0,14676,1335307,00.html Screen Burn, The Guide]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>

Following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], ''The Guardian'' published an article on its comment pages by [[Dilpazier Aslam]], a 27 year old British [[Muslim]] journalism trainee from [[Yorkshire]].<ref>Dilpazier Aslam, 2005-07-13. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1527323,00.html We rock the boat]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> Aslam was a member of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], an [[Islamist]] group, and had published a number of articles on their website. According to the paper, it did not know that Aslam was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir when he applied to become a trainee, though several staff members were informed of this once he started at the paper.<ref>Media Guardian, 2005-07-22. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1534494,00.html Background: the Guardian and Dilpazier Aslam]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> The [[Home Office]] has claimed the group's "ultimate aim is the establishment of an [[Islamic]] state (Caliphate), according to Hizb ut-Tahrir via non-violent means". ''The Guardian'' asked Aslam to resign his membership of the group and, when he did not do so, terminated his employment.<ref>Steve Busfield, 2005-07-22. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,1534480,00.html Dilpazier Aslam leaves Guardian]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>

On January 8th of 2007, an article in ''The Guardian'' read: "Romania's first gift to the European Union, a caucus of neo-fascists and Holocaust deniers", alluding to the fact that Romania and Bulgaria's joining of the European Union would allow for the formation of a far-right faction in the European Parliament.  As [[Robin Shepherd]], an expert on global integration and GMF political analyst, pointed out, many frowned upon the tone with which the English press wrote about Europe's newcomers.  He asked: "...what is a high-level, pro-European Union newspaper playing at in headlining a report on the rise of hard-line nationalism with language that could itself be construed as pandering to xenophobia?"<ref>Robin Shepherd, "Romania, Bulgaria, and the EU's Future." GMFUS</ref>

The paper's comment and opinion pages, though dominated by centre-left writers and academics like [[Polly Toynbee]], allow some space for right of centre voices such as [[Simon Jenkins]].

===Format and distribution===
The first edition was published on [[May 5]], [[1821]],<ref>Schoolnet n.d. "[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRguardian.htm Manchester Guardian]."</ref> at which time the ''Guardian'' was a weekly, published on Saturdays and costing 7[[penny|d]].; the [[stamp duty]] on newspapers (4[[penny|d]]. per sheet) forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently. When the stamp duty was cut in 1836 the ''Guardian'' added a Wednesday edition; with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d.

In 1952 the paper took the step of printing news on the front page, replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space. Then-editor A. P. Wadsworth wrote: "It is not a thing I like myself, but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion."

[[Image:GuardianHQLondon1.jpg|thumb|right|''The Guardian'''s offices in London]]
In 1959 the paper dropped "Manchester" from its title, becoming simply ''The Guardian'', and in 1964 it moved to [[London]], losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the less intellectual but much more profitable ''[[Manchester Evening News]]''. The financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s; at one time it was in merger talks with ''The Times''. The paper consolidated its [[centre-left]] stance during the 1970s and 1980s but was both shocked and revitalised by the launch of ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1986 which competed for a similar readership and provoked the entire broadsheet industry into a fight for circulation.

On [[12 February]] [[1988]] ''The Guardian'' had a significant redesign; as well as improving the quality of its printers' ink, it also changed its masthead to the now familiar juxtaposition of an [[Italic type|italic]] [[Garamond]] "''The''", with a bold [[Helvetica]] "Guardian", which remained in use until the [[2005]] redesign.

In 1992 it relaunched its features section as G2, a tabloid-format supplement. This innovation was widely copied by the other "quality" broadsheets, and ultimately led to the rise of "compact" papers and ''The Guardian'''s move to the Berliner format. In 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet 'price war' started by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s ''The Times''. In June 1993, ''The Guardian'' bought ''[[The Observer]]'' from [[Lonrho]], thus gaining a serious Sunday newspaper partner with similar political views.

Its international weekly edition is now titled ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'', though it retained the title ''Manchester Guardian Weekly'' for some years after the home edition had moved to London. It includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat left-of-centre inclination, including ''[[Le Monde]]''. The Guardian Weekly is also linked to a website for expatriates [[Guardian Abroad]].

''g24'' is a constantly-updated electronic newspaper available free of charge. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/g24] It is downloadable as a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file. The contents come from ''The Guardian'' and its Sunday sibling ''[[The Observer]]''.

==Moving to the Berliner paper format==
In 2004, ''The Guardian'' announced plans to change to a "[[Berliner (format)|Berliner]]" or "[[midi (newspaper)|midi]]" format similar to that used by the ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'' and ''[[Le Monde]]'' in France and many other [[Europe]]an papers; at 470&times;315&nbsp;mm, this is slightly larger than a traditional [[tabloid]]. Planned for the autumn of 2005, this change was either a response to, or has the same cause as, the moves by ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' to start publishing in tabloid (or compact) format. On Thursday [[1 September]] [[2005]] ''The Guardian'' announced that it would launch the new format on Monday [[12 September]] [[2005]].<ref>Claire Cozens, 2005-09-01. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1560525,00.html New-look Guardian launches on September 12]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> Sister Sunday newspaper ''The Observer'' went over to the same format on [[8 January]] [[2006]].

The advantage that ''The Guardian'' saw in the Berliner format was that though it is only a little wider than a tabloid, and is thus equally easy to read on [[public transport]], its greater height gives more flexibility in page design. The new presses mean that printing can go right across the 'gutter', the strip down the middle of the centre page, allowing the paper to print striking double page pictures. The new presses also made the paper the first UK national able to print in full colour on every page.

The format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the paper's look. On Friday [[9 September]] [[2005]] the newspaper unveiled its new look front page, which débuted on Monday [[12 September]] [[2005]]. Designed by [[Mark Porter]], the new look includes a new [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]] for the newspaper, its first since 1988. A typeface family called Guardian Egyptian, designed by [[Paul Barnes (designer)|Paul Barnes]] and [[Christian Schwartz]], was created for the new design. No other typeface is used anywhere in the paper - all stylistic variations are based on various forms of Guardian Egyptian.

The switch cost Guardian Newspapers £80 million and involved setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester. This was because prior to the Guardian's move, no printing presses in the UK could produce newspapers in the Berliner format. There were additional complications as one of the Guardian's presses was part-owned by ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph Newspapers]]'' and ''[[The Daily Express|Express Newspapers]]'', and it was contracted to use the plant until 2009. Another press was shared with the [[Guardian Media Group]]'s north western tabloid local papers, which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format.

The new format was generally well received by ''Guardian'' readers, who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes. The only controversy was over the dropping of the ''[[Doonesbury]]'' cartoon strip. ''The Guardian'' reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss and within 24 hours, the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week. ''G2'' section editor Ian Katz, who was responsible for dropping it, apologised in the editors' blog saying, "I'm sorry, once again, that I made you - and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments' address - so cross".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit/story/0,,1600349,00.html/ ''Guardian Reborn'', Guardian Unlimited].Retrieved on [[2007-07-22]].</ref> Some readers are however dissatisfied as the earlier deadline needed for the all-colour sports section has meant that coverage of late-finishing evening football matches is less satisfactory than before the redesign in the editions supplied to some parts of the country.

The investment was rewarded with a circulation rise. In December 2005, the average daily sale stood at 380,693, nearly 6% higher than the figure for December 2004.<ref>Claire Cozens, 2006-01-13. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/circulationfigures/story/0,,1685936,00.html Telegraph sales hit all-time low]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> In 2006, the US-based [[Society for News Design]] chose ''The Guardian'' and Polish daily ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'' as the world's best-designed newspapers &ndash; from among 389 entries from 44 countries.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1714643,00.html | title=Guardian wins design award | author=Steve Busfield |date=February 21, 2006 | publisher=Guardian}}</ref>

[[Image:Guardian01.jpg|thumb|right|''The Guardian'' from the [[21 January]] [[2007]] including the G2 supplement]]
On each weekday ''The Guardian'' comes with the G2 supplement containing feature articles, columns, television and radio listings, and the quick crossword. Since the change to the Berliner format, there is a separate daily Sport section. Other regular supplements during the week include:
; Monday : ''MediaGuardian, Office Hours''

; Tuesday : ''EducationGuardian''

; Wednesday : ''SocietyGuardian'' (covers the British [[public sector]] and related issues)


; Thursday : ''TechnologyGuardian''

; Friday : ''Film & Music''

; Saturday : ''The Guide'' (a weekly [[listings magazine]]), ''Weekend'' (the colour supplement), ''Review'' (covers [[literature]]), ''Money'', ''Work'', ''Graduate'', ''Travel'' and ''Family''.

Though the main news section was in the large broadsheet format, the supplements were all in the half-sized [[tabloid]] format, with the exception of the glossy ''Weekend'' section which was a 290×245mm magazine and ''The Guide'' which was in a small 225×145mm format.

With the change of the main section to the Berliner format, the specialist sections are now printed as Berliner, as is a now-daily Sports section, but G2 has moved to a "magazine-sized" demi-Berliner format. A Thursday Technology section and daily science coverage in the news section replaced Life and Online. ''Weekend'' and ''The Guide'' are still in the same small formats as before the change.

On Monday to Thursday, the supplements carry substantial quantities of recruitment advertising as well as editorial on their specialised topics.

===Regular columns===

===Online media===
{{main|Guardian Unlimited}}
''The Guardian'' and its Sunday sibling, ''The Observer'' publish all their news online, with free access both to current news and an archive of three million stories. A third of the site's hits are for items over a month old<ref>Emily Bell, 2005-10-08. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1587517,00.html Editor's Week]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>. The website also offers a free printable A4 format [[PDF]] 24-hour newspaper, G24<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/g24 ''G24'' e-daily page]</ref> &ndash; made up of the top stories &ndash; and, for a monthly subscription, the complete newspaper in [[PDF]] format. It is the most widely read [[UK]] newspaper site<ref>[http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3441.shtml ''Times gains, Guardian and Telegraph drop in ABCe monthlies'', 26 July 2007].Retrieved on [[2007-08-03]].</ref> with more than 14.5 million users a month, compared with the second-placed [[The Times]]'s 9 million users a month. This has been put down to its free, unrestricted access.

''The Guardian'' also has a [[Guardian Unlimited Talk|number of talkboards]] that are noted for their mix of political discussion and whimsy. They were spoofed in the ''Guardian's'' own regular humorous ''Chatroom'' column in G2. The spoof column purported to be excerpts from a chatroom on [http://permachat.co.uk permachat.co.uk], a real URL which points to ''The Guardian'''s talkboards.

In the '[[Comment is Free]]' section the public is invited to join in rigorous and sometimes bad-tempered debates about political issues. The section is comprised of ''Guardian'' columns and online pieces by other contributors, many of whom end up facing heavy criticism from readers.

''The Guardian'' has also launched a dating website, ''Soulmates''<ref>[http://dating.guardian.co.uk/s/ Guardian ''Soulmates'' website].Retrieved on [[2007-08-03]].</ref>, and is experimenting with new media, offering a free twelve part weekly [[Podcast]] series by [[Ricky Gervais]]<ref>Jason Deans, 2005-12-08. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1662771,00.html Gervais to host [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] Christmas show]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>. In January 2006 Gervais' show topped the [[iTunes]] podcast chart having been downloaded by two million listeners worldwide<ref>Media Guardian "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,7558,1692472,00.html Comedy stars and radio DJs top the download charts]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>, and is scheduled to be listed in the 2007 ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the most downloaded Podcast<ref>John Plunkett, 2006-02-06. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/newmedia/story/0,,1703594,00.html]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>.

==''The Guardian'' in popular culture==
The nickname '''''The Grauniad''''' for the paper originated with the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. It came about because of its reputation for frequent and sometimes unintentionally amusing typographical errors, hence the popular myth that the paper once misspelled its own name on the page one masthead as ''The Gaurdian'', though many recall the more inventive ''The Grauniad''. The very first issue of the newspaper contained a number of errors, perhaps the most notable being a notification that there would soon be some goods sold at ''atction'' instead of ''auction''. {{Fact|date=June 2007}} There are fewer [[typographical error]]s in the paper since the end of [[Hot metal typesetting|hot-metal typesetting]]{{Fact|date=October 2007}} &ndash; to maintain a tradition, the daily 'Corrections and clarifications' column lists even the smallest mistakes.

Until the founding of the ''Independent'', the ''Guardian'' was Britain's only 'serious' national daily newspaper to support centrist or centre-left politics. The term "''Guardian'' reader" has been used pejoratively by those who do not agree with the paper &ndash; and self-deprecatingly by those who do. There are many stereotypes, but perhaps the most prominent is that of the Labour-voting middle-class ''Guardian'' reader with centre-left/left-wing politics rooted in the 1960s, working in the public sector or academia, sometimes eating [[lentil]]s and [[muesli]], living in north [[London]] (especially [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and [[Islington]]), wearing [[Sandal (footwear)|sandals]], sometimes believing in [[alternative medicine]] and [[natural medicine]] though more often atheistic or non-religious and rational. It has been shown that the majority of university students in the UK read the ''Guardian''.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} This might be illustrated by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Kevin Hughes]]'s largely rhetorical question in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[November 19]], [[2001]]:

<blockquote>"Does my right hon. Friend find it bizarre — as I do — that the yoghurt- and muesli-eating, ''Guardian''-reading fraternity are only too happy to protect the [[human rights]] of people engaged in [[terrorism|terrorist]] acts, but never once do they talk about the human rights of those who are affected by them?"<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo011119/debtext/11119-08.htm#11119-08_spnew3 Hansard 374:54 2001-11-19].</ref></blockquote>

The Guardian's cartoon strips by [[Posy Simmonds]] during the 1980s satirised the paper's stereotype reader, relating events in the life of, among others, former nurse Wendy Weber and her polytechnic sociology lecturer husband George.

The ''Guardian'''s [[science]] coverage is extensive. The paper also appears to have moved away from covering alternative therapies. Its ''Weekend'' supplement featured a column by [[Emma Mitchell]], a natural health therapist, until August 2006 and G2 was, until the relaunch, home to [[Edzard Ernst|Edzard Ernst's]] weekly column on complementary medicine (Ernst is professor of complementary medicine at the Plymouth, [[Devon]]-based [[Medical school (United Kingdom)|Peninsula Medical School]], <ref>Sarah Boseley, 2003-09-26 "[http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,1392,1048903,00.html The alternative professor]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>), the paper now carries the debunking ''Bad Science'' column<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/
| title = Bad Science
| publisher = The Guardian
| accessdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref>
by [[Ben Goldacre]] which has been the source of a recent controversy over the efficacy of [[homeopathy]].

The [[stereotype]] of the Guardian reader is, however, a persistent feature of British political discourse. [[Physician|Doctor]]s have used the "doctor slang" acronym ''GROLIES'' (Guardian Reader Of Low Intelligence in Ethnic Skirt) on patient notes.<ref>''BBC News'', 2003-08-18. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3159813.stm Doctor slang is a dying art]."</ref> It must be noted, however, that ''Guardian'' readers are usually portrayed as being highly intelligent but detached and alienated from [[noumenal]] concerns.

''The Guardian'', along with other British news outlets, has a tradition of [[Parody|spoof]] articles on [[April Fool's Day]], sometimes contributed by regular advertisers such as [[BMW]]. The most elaborate of these was a travel supplement on [[San Serriffe]], whilst an article in the ''Guardian'' dated [[April 1]] [[2006]] written by one Olaf Priol suggested that [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]] would be supporting the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] at the next [[General Election]] and had already written a campaign song for them. Olaf Priol is an [[anagram]] of April Fool.

===References in fiction===
* In the play ''[[Hobson's Choice]]'' Henry Horatio Hobson worries that his reputation will be in tatters after '[[trespassing]]'. He comments that if the news were to be intercepted by the ''Manchester Guardian'' then everyone would know.
* The 1984 Christmas special of ''[[Yes Minister]]'' shows a number of newspapers tipping Jim Hacker as the next Prime Minister including ''The Guardian''. In Episode 6 a group of pro-[[badger]] protesters tell [[James Hacker|Jim Hacker]] that the Guardian told them the area they are fighting to save has been inhabitated by badgers for generations. In fact Hacker points out jokingly the "bodgers" have lived there for "generators", satirising the Guardian's reputation for spelling errors.
* In Episode 4 of the second series of ''[[Yes Minister|Yes, Prime Minister]]'', [[Jim Hacker]] says:
:"I know exactly who reads the papers: ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' is read by people who think they run the country; ''The Guardian'' is read by people who think they ought to run the country; ''[[The Times]]'' is read by people who actually do run the country; ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' is read by the wives of the people who run the country; ''[[The Financial Times]]'' is read by people who own the country; ''[[The Morning Star]]'' is read by people who think the country ought to be run by [[USSR|another country]]; and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' is read by people who think it is."
:[[Humphrey Appleby|Sir Humphrey]]: "Prime Minister, what about the people who read ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''?"
:[[Bernard Woolley]]: "''Sun'' readers don't care who runs the country, as long as she's got big tits."

The above "Yes Minister" script excerpt borrows heavily from a joke in wide circulation during the early 1970s (probably from a story told in one of [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]]'s television series).
* In the ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|Young Ones]]'' episode "Boring," Rick eagerly notes that ''The Guardian'' has an article on how to get an increased [[student grant]]. Unfortunately the paper has totally mangled the spelling of a key part of it, leaving Rick with no idea how to get the increased grant. Worse still, the misspelling happens to sound the same as a Satanic chant, so that when Neil repeats what Rick read out loud he accidentally summons a demon who tries to kill everyone there.
* In the ''[[Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', an entire planet goes into hibernation to wait out a galactic recession, only reviving themselves when the stock market reaches a satisfactorily high level for their needs. "Arthur [Dent], a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked by this."
* In the [[Sandy Duncan]] episode in the first season of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', [[Statler]] demonstrates his extreme age by using the pre-1959 name:
:[[Statler & Waldorf|Waldorf]]: Statler, do you 'get' the banana sketch?
:Statler: No, I get ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''The Manchester Guardian''.
* In the 2006 film ''[[American Dreamz]]'', the US president played by Dennis Quaid is known for not reading the papers, until he starts reading the Guardian. 
* In the film, ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum]]'', Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is mentioned in an article published in The Guardian and a reporter working for the newspaper itself plays a key role in the film.

==Literary and media awards==
''The Guardian'' is the sponsor of two major literary awards: The [[Guardian First Book Award]], established in 1999 as a successor to the [[Guardian Fiction Award]] which had run since 1965, and the [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], founded in 1967. In recent years it has also sponsored the [[Hay Festival]] in [[Hay-on-Wye]].

The annual [[Guardian Student Media Awards]], founded in 1999, recognise excellence in journalism and design of British [[university]] and college [[student newspapers]], magazines and websites.

In memory of [[Paul Foot]], who died in 2004, ''The Guardian'' and ''[[Private Eye]]'' jointly set up the "Paul Foot Award", with an annual £10,000 prize fund, for investigative/campaigning journalism.<ref>[http://www.midaspr.co.uk/press_office.asp?CatID=22 The Paul Foot Award for campaigning journalism]</ref> [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' won the first prize of £5,000 in 2005, and David Harrison picked up the 2006 award for his investigation into sex trafficking in Eastern Europe published in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''.      

From a "long list" of 17 entries for the 2007 award, the seven judges &ndash; Brian McArthur (Chair), [[Ian Hislop]], [[Alan Rusbridger]], Bill Hagerty, Clare Fermont, [[Jeremy Dear]] and [[Richard Ingrams]] &ndash; [[shortlist]]ed seven nominations:
#Phil Baty, ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]''
#Paul Keilthy, ''[[Camden New Journal]]''
#David Leigh and Rob Evans, ''The Guardian''
#Rob Waugh, ''[[Yorkshire Post]]''
#''[[The Star (newspaper)|The Salford Star]]''
#Richard Brooks, ''[[Private Eye]]'' and
#Deborah Wain, ''[[Doncaster Free Press]]''<ref>[http://www.private-eye.co.uk/pictures/paul_foot/2007_PF_Shortlist.pdf The Paul Foot Award for Campaigning Journalism - 2007 Short List]</ref>

The 2007 "Paul Foot Award" was announced at the Media and Spin Bar, [[Millbank Tower]] on Monday, 15 October 2007. The top prize of £5,000 was shared by Deborah Wain, ''[[Doncaster Free Press]]'' and by David Leigh and Rob Evans, ''The Guardian''. The remaining five nominees &ndash; Phil Baty, Richard Brooks, Paul Keilthy, Rob Waugh and free magazine, ''The Salford Star'' &ndash; were each awarded a £1,000 prize.<ref>[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/greenslade/2007/10/foot_award_winners_keep_invest.html Foot award winners keep investigative journalism light burning bright]</ref>

==The Newsroom archive==
''The Guardian'' and its sister newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' also provide [http://www.guardian.co.uk/newsroom The Newsroom], a visitor centre in [[London]]. It contains their [[archive]]s, including bound copies of old editions, a [[photographic]] [[library]] and other items such as [[diaries]], [[letter]]s and [[notebook]]s. This material may be consulted by members of the public. The Newsroom also mounts temporary exhibitions and runs an educational programme for schools. There is also an extensive ''Manchester Guardian'' archive at the [[University of Manchester]]'s [[John Rylands Library]] and there is a collaboration programme between the two archives. The [[British Library]] also has a large archive of the ''Manchester Guardian'', available in online, hard copy, microform, and CD-ROM in their
[http://www.bl.uk/collections/newspapers.html British Library Newspapers] collection.

In November 2007 ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' made their archives available over the internet via [http://archive.guardian.co.uk/ DigitalArchive]. The current extent of the archives available are [[1821]] to [[1975]] for ''The Guardian'' and [[1900]] to [[1975]] for ''The Observer''. However, these archives are to be expanded in the future.
