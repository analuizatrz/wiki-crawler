'''Hayley Dee Westenra''' (born [[10 April]] [[1987]] in [[Christchurch]]) is a [[New Zealand]] [[soprano]]. Her first album, ''[[Pure (Hayley Westenra album)|Pure]]'', reached #1 on the [[United Kingdom|UK]] classical charts and has sold over two million copies worldwide. 

Westenra is the fastest-selling debut classical artist to date. In addition to her success at selling albums, she became an international star at the age of 16 when the first of her international albums were released. She is currently a member of the group [[Celtic Woman]].

She has performed for dignitaries around the world and is the youngest [[UNICEF]] Ambassador to date.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Westenra was born to Jill and Gerald Westenra and has two siblings, Sophie and Isaac.  She comes from a musically-inclined family: her grandmother Shirley Ireland was a singer and her grandfather was a pianist who played the [[accordian|piano-accordian]].<ref name="DVDLIVE1">{{cite video |title=Hayley Westenra: Live from New Zealand |medium=DVD |year=2005 |publisher=Universal Music}}</ref>

Her musical career began at the age of six when she was cast in the lead singing role of "Little Star" in her school's [[Christmas]] play. After the show, a teacher who had watched the performance approached her parents and informed them that their daughter had [[absolute pitch|perfect pitch]].<ref name="DVDLIVE1" /> The teacher encouraged Westenra to pick up a musical instrument to improve her abilities, and she began to take [[violin]] lessons. Along with the violin, she took up the piano and the recorder, and learned to read music by the age of seven. She began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage.<ref name=DVDLIVE1/> Out of these performances, she remembers not always getting the parts she wanted: "I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In ''[[A Christmas Carol]],'' I was Tiny Tim, so I got to be quite a sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing."<ref name=cbs_online_article_1>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/03/entertainment/main1367468.shtml |title=Hayley Westenra: Teen Angel |work=CBSNews.com |first=Ellen |last=Crean |date=[[2006-03-03]] |accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref>

At the age of 12, Westenra entered a professional recording studio to record ''[[Walking in the Air (album)|Walking in the Air]]'', a demo album done for friends and family; only about 1000 copies were made. Some time later, after finishing her album, both Westenra and her sister, Sophie, [[busking|busked]] in the Christchurch streets.  The pair drew a large crowd, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. This woman turned out to be a journalist with [[Canterbury Television|CTV]], and asked Westenra to appear on air. 

A concert promotion company watched the show, and signed her to the Universal New Zealand label. The concert promoter who saw her and was responsible for this deal was Gray Bartlett, who had not even met Westenra in person.<ref name="sexton_article">{{cite news |url=http://www.hayley-westenra-international.com/dhtml-pages/html-2004/news/20040327_Hayley%20Westenra%20-%20Kiwi%20Star%20Impresses%20The%20World.htm |title=Hayley Westenra: Kiwi Star Impresses the World |work=Billboard '''15''' (3) |first=Paul |last=Sexton |format=Reprint |coauthors=Christie Eliezer, Anastasia Tsioulcas |date=[[2004-03-27]] |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref><ref name="boston_globe_article_1">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/07/04/at_17_new_zealand_soprano_has_a_voice_to_be_reckoned_with/ |title=At 17, New Zealand soprano has a voice to be reckoned with |work=The Boston Globe |first=Joan |last=Anderman |date=[[2004-07-04]] |accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref> On this label, Westenra released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as ''[[My Gift to You]]'', a CD of Christmas music. As a result of her success in selling albums in New Zealand, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame [[Malvina Major]].<ref name="DVDLIVE1" />

===International success===
Although her albums were quite successful in New Zealand, Westenra was unknown worldwide until she landed a contract with [[Decca Records]] and recorded ''[[Pure (Hayley Westenra album)|Pure]]'', a CD of classical, light pop and traditional [[Māori]] songs. Decca's UK president was also impressed with her voice when they signed her to the label, saying that she was "captivated by the beauty and expressiveness of her voice."<ref name="McNickel_article">{{cite news |title=Teen-age Classics |work=Billboard '''41''' (1) |first=David |last=McNickel |date=[[2002-02-16]] |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> ''Pure'' enjoyed record-topping success. It became the fastest-selling debut album in the history of the [[UK classical chart]]s. ''Pure'' sold 19,068 copies in its first week alone, quickly reached #1 on the UK chart, and entered the [[UK Albums Chart|UK Pop Chart]] at #8.<ref name="sexton_article" /> To date, over two million copies of ''Pure'' have been sold. In New Zealand ''Pure'' has been certified 10x platinum, making her the best-selling artist — regardless of genre — in the country's history.<ref name="performingarts1">{{cite press release |url=http://www.performingarts.ufl.edu/programs/Hayley%20Westenra.pdf |title=Teenage songstress Hayley Westenra brings gorgeous classical crossover music to the Phillips Center |publisher=University of Florida Performing Arts |format=PDF |date=[[2006-03-03]] |accessdate=2006-03-22}}</ref> 

This album ensured that Decca would take her seriously. When the facts are presented about her fame today, some of her fame can be directly attributed to the way in which Decca promoted her. Although the traditional audience of classical crossover music is that of adult women, they also promoted her to children and teenagers.<ref name="hailing_distance_of_us">{{cite news |url=http://www.hayley-westenra-international.com/dhtml-pages/html-2004/news/20040327_Hayley%20Westenra%20-%20In%20Hailing%20Distance%20Of%20US%20Debut.htm |title=In Hailing Distance Of U.S. Debut |format=Reprint |work=Billboard '''15''' (2) |first=Anastasia |last=Tsioulcas |date=[[2004-03-27]] |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> Westenra recorded the end-title song for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s movie ''[[Mulan II]]''.<ref name="mulan2">{{cite video |title=Mulan II |people=Rooney, Darrell (Director) and Lynne Southerland |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |year=2004}}</ref> They also featured her on the national [[Radio Disney]] music education tour for middle-school students. David Horn, the producer of her live tv special which aired on [[PBS]]' [[Great Performances]], said, "Her singing is so gorgeous it's reminiscent of the great boy-soprano sound of Anglican church choirs."<ref name="hailing_distance_of_us" /> This special was entitled, ''Hayley Westenra: Live from New Zealand''.<ref name="DVDLIVE1" /><ref name="pbs1">{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/westenra/ |title=Hayley Westenra: Live from New Zealand |work=PBS |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref>

[[Image:Hayleyamericandreams.jpg|left|thumb|Westenra on ''[[American Dreams]]'']]

Decca has also promoted her on television. She took her first acting role on the [[United States|US]] programme ''[[American Dreams]]'' ("Charade"), where she played [[guitar]] and sang "Who Painted the Moon Black?".<ref name="americandreams1">{{cite episode |title=Charade |series=American Dreams |serieslink=American Dreams |airdate=2004-10-03 |season=2 |episode=46 |network=[[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]}}</ref>

While she was being promoted in [[Los Angeles, California]], Marc Johnston, senior VP/GM for the Universal Classics Group, said, "When she was out there, people were giving her scripts to read, and she had a few rather impromptu auditions. So some film and TV roles are currently in the works."<ref name="hailing_distance_of_us" />

In November 2004, Westenra performed in a concert for [[Majesty|Her Majesty]] The Queen, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], [[Prince Charles]], [[Colin Powell]], [[Condoleezza Rice]] and President [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="the_hayley_show_article">{{cite news |title=Can't Stop the Music |work=Women's Wear Daily |first=Nandini |last=D'Souza |coauthors=Venessa Lau |date=[[2004-04-29]] |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> 

In 2005, she was featured in the song "[[Bridal Ballad]]" that was recorded for the movie ''[[The Merchant of Venice (2004 film)|The Merchant of Venice]]''.<ref name="merchant">{{cite video |title=The Merchant of Venice |publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment |year=2004 |people=Radford, Michael (Director)}}</ref> More recently, she was featured on the motion picture soundtrack for ''[[The New World]]'' for the song "[[Listen to the Wind]]".

After releasing ''Pure'', Westenra and her family moved to [[London]]. She continues to live in her own central London flat, even though her family subsequently returned home to Christchurch. Although she spent most of 2006 touring, she did her best to visit them when she could.<ref name="march_06_newsletter">{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/newsletter/march_2006.html |title=March 2006 Newsletter |work=HayleyWestenra.com |accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref> Westenra was the 2004 Vodafone [[New Zealand Music Awards]] winner of "Highest Selling New Zealand Album" and "International Achievement Award"<ref name="vodafone1">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzmusicawards.co.nz/awards2006/history2004.html |title=Winners 2004 |work=NZMusicAwards.co.nz |accessdate=2007-04-15}} </ref> On [[20 February]] [[2004]], Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] awarded her for being the first New Zealand artist to receive the tenfold platinum status in the New Zealand market, where she held the number one artist position for 18 weeks.<ref name="sexton_article" /> She has won two Japanese Grammies for her work (Song of the Year, "[[Amazing Grace]]" and Album of the Year, ''Pure''). Also in 2004, she began her world tour of [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. At the [[Sydney Opera House]] she received a rare [[standing ovation]]. She concluded 2004 with a successful Christmas tour of the east coast of the [[United States]] as guest soloist with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]].<ref name="officialsite_bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/hayley-westenra-biography.htm |title=Biography |work=HayleyWestenra.com |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref>

In 2005, she released a new album called ''Odyssey''. A mix of classical, pop, Celtic, and new age music, she co-wrote and arranged some of the tracks on the album, which was released in the United States on [[18 October]] [[2005]]. A more recent version of ''Odyssey'' was released in the United Kingdom on [[10 April]] [[2006]], her 19th birthday. It has several new recordings not on the original album. Ending 2005, she made an appearance on [[Kurt Browning]]'s programme ''Gotta Skate'', which aired on [[18 December]], in which she performed with [[Andrea Bocelli]].<ref name="skate1">{{cite video |title=Kurt Browning's Gotta Skate 2005 |publisher=[[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] |medium=Television production |date=December 18 |year=2005}}</ref>

She spent the first half of 2006 performing as a supporting act for the pop-opera quartet [[Il Divo]] on a worldwide tour, though in March she performed several solo concerts in the U.S. as well. That tour officially ended in June, but was then extended by six performances.  She then held several concerts in the [[UK]] and [[Germany]] through the end of the summer.<ref name="officialwebsite_news">{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/hayley-westenra-news.htm |title=News |work=HayleyWestenra.com |accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref> 

On [[5 September]] [[2006]], Westenra was named as one of the ten outstanding young people in the world by the [[Junior Chamber International]]. On [[13 November]] [[2006]] she participated in the dedication of the New Zealand War Memorial in London.<ref name="NZedge">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/search/story.cfm?storyid=00046269-312D-1556-AD7E83027AF1010F |title=Queen, Blair, Clark at opening of NZ memorial |work=New Zealand Herald |first=Andy |last=Macdonald |date=[[2006-11-12]] |accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref>

In August 2006, she joined [[Celtic Woman]], and is featured on their second major DVD/CD album, ''[[Celtic Woman: A New Journey]]'', which was released [[January 30]] [[2007]] and immediately hit the Billboard Top 200 music chart at #4.<ref name="celtic_new_journey_billboard">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Albums&f=The+Billboard+200 |title=The Billboard 200 |work=Billboard |accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref> She will be touring with the group in the United States in 2007, with scheduled appearances in 88 venues across the country.<ref name="celticwoman187">{{cite web |url=http://www.celticwoman.com/viewSection.asp?idSection=187&id=tour |title=US Tour Dates |work=CelticWoman.com |accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref>

Westenra's third international album, ''Treasure'', was released on [[26 February]] [[2007]] in the UK. Tracks on this album include "E Pari Ra", "One Fine Day", "Let Me Lie", "[[Danny Boy]]", and "[[Abide With Me]]". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also features singer [[Humphrey Berney]]. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name ''Celtic Treasure''.  Westenra has dedicated the album to her grandmother Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the UK edition, she wrote "I come from a musical family, and one with a real sense of history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from [[Ireland]] to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 - there's even a plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra to commemorate this. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like ''Danny Boy'' from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album."
