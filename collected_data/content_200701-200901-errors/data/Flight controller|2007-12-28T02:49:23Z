'''Flight controllers''' are personnel who aid in the operations of a space flight, working in Mission Control Centers such as [[NASA]]'s [[Mission Control Center]], or [[ESA]]'s [[European Space Operations Centre|Operations Center]]. Flight controllers sit at computer consoles and use [[telemetry]] to monitor in real time various technical aspects of a manned space mission. Each controller is an expert in a specific area, and is in constant communication with additional experts in the "back room". The Flight Director is the lead flight controller, monitors the activities of others and has overall responsibility for the mission success and safety.  A Flight Director leads a team, designated by a color (e.g., [[Eugene F. Kranz]] led the White Team, and was known as "White Flight").

== NASA's Flight Controllers ==
The room where the flight controllers work was called the Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR, pronounced "moh-ker"), and now is called the Flight Control Room (FCR, pronounced "ficker").  The controllers are experts in individual systems, and make recommendations to the Flight Director involving their areas of responsibility.  Any controller may call for an [[Abort (computing)|abort]] if the circumstances require it.  Before (and at various stages during) an activity, the Flight Director will "go around the room," polling each controller for a GO / NO GO decision.  If all factors are good, each controller calls for a GO, but if there is a problem requiring a hold or an abort, the call is NO GO.  Another form of this is STAY / NO STAY, when the spacecraft has completed a maneuver and has now "parked" in relation to another body, including spacecraft (or space stations), orbiting the Earth or the Moon, or the Lunar landings. 

Controllers in MOCR/FCR are supported by the "backrooms," teams of specialists located in other parts of the building or even at other facilities across the country.  These teams are able to find information and make recommendations to "their" controller.  One example of the usefulness of this system occurred during the descent of the [[Apollo 11|Eagle]] [[Lunar Module]], when "1202" and "1201" "program alarms" came from the LM.  GUIDO [[Steve Bales]], not sure whether to call for an abort, trusted the experts in the Guidance backroom, especially [[Jack Garman]], who told him that the problem was a computer overload, but could be ignored if it was intermittent.  Bales called "GO!," Flight Director Kranz accepted the call and the mission continued to success.  Without the support of the backroom, a controller might make a "bad call" based on faulty memory or information not readily available to the person on the console.  

The backroom was formally called the Staff Support Room (SSR), and is now called the Multi-Purpose Support Room (MPSR, pronounced "mipser").  

[[Unmanned space mission|Unmanned U.S. space missions]] also have flight controllers but are managed from separate organizations, either the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] for deep-space missions or [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] for near-Earth missions.

Each flight controller has a unique [[call sign]], which describes the position's responsibilities. The call sign and responsibility refer to the particular ''console'', not just the person, since missions are managed around the clock and with each shift change a different person takes over the console.

Flight controller responsibilities have changed over time, and continue to evolve. New controllers are added, and tasks are reassigned to other controllers to keep up with changing technical systems. For example the EECOM handled [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command and Service Module]] communication systems through [[Apollo 10]], which was afterward assigned to a new position called INCO.

=== Shuttle and space station flight controllers ===
There are currently two groups of flight controllers at [[Johnson Space Center]]: the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) flight controllers and the [[Space Shuttle]] flight controllers.    

The Space Shuttle flight controllers work relatively brief periods: The several minutes of ascent, the few days the vehicle is in orbit, and reentry.  The duration of operations for Space Shuttle flight controllers is short and time-critical. A failure on the Shuttle could leave flight controllers little time for talking, putting pressure on them to respond quickly to potential failures. The Space Shuttle flight controllers generally have limited capability to send commands to the shuttle for system reconfigurations. 

In contrast, the ISS flight controllers work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  This allows the ISS flight controllers time to discuss off-[[nominal]] telemetry.  The ISS flight controllers have the opportunity to interface with many groups and engineering experts.  The mentality of an ISS flight controller is to preempt a failure.  Telemetry is closely monitored for any signatures that may begin to indicate future catastrophic failures.  Generally, ISS flight controllers take a [[prophylactic]] approach to space vehicle operations.  There are command capabilities that ISS flight controllers use to preclude a potential failure.

=== Responsibility ===
Flight controllers are responsible for the success of the mission and for the lives of the astronauts under their watch. The Flight Controllers' Creed states that they must "always be aware that suddenly and unexpectedly [they] may find ourselves in a role where [their] performance has ultimate consequences". Well-known actions taken by flight controllers include the following:

* During the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing, the [[Lunar Module]] guidance computer began giving errors which threatened to abort the landing. Guidance officer [[Steve Bales]] had only a few seconds to determine it was safe to proceed, which saved the mission. Bales was later honored for his role in the mission, when he was selected to accept the NASA Group Achievement Award from President [[Richard Nixon]] on behalf of the [[Apollo 11]] mission operations team.

* During the launch of [[Apollo 12]], the [[Saturn V]] was struck by lightning which knocked out all [[telemetry]] and the Apollo guidance unit. This would probably have aborted the mission if EECOM controller [[John Aaron]] had not quickly determined that an obscure cockpit switch (controlling telemetry sources) could fix the problem.

* During space shuttle mission [[STS-51-F]], a [[Space shuttle main engine|main engine]] failed during ascent to orbit. A second engine began showing signs of failing. If it failed it would cause an [[Space Shuttle abort modes|emergency landing in Spain]], or possibly could cause the shuttle to ditch in the ocean. Booster officer Jenny Howard Stein determined within seconds it was an incorrect sensor and not an engine problem. At her direction the crew inhibited the sensor, which saved the mission and possibly the crew.

=== Common flight control positions ===

There are some positions that have and will serve the same function in every vehicle's Flight Control team.  The group of individuals serving in those positions may be different, but they will be called the same thing and serve the same function.

====Flight Director (FLIGHT) ====
Leads the flight control team. "Flight" has overall operational responsibility for missions and payload operations and for all decisions regarding safe, expedient flight. This person monitors the other flight controllers, remaining in constant verbal communication with them via intercom channels called "loops".

====Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) ====
Is a representative of the senior management chain at JSC, and is there to help the flight director make those decisions that have no safety-of-flight consequences, but may have cost or public perception consequences.  In no cases can the MOD rep overrule the Flight Director during a mission.

====Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)====<!-- This section is linked from [[STS-51-L Mission timeline]] -->
Generally the only person who communicates directly with a manned space crew. During much of the U.S. [[Human spaceflight|manned space program]], [[NASA]] felt it was important for all communication with the [[astronaut]]s in space to pass through a single individual in the [[Mission Control Center]]. That role was designated the ''Capsule Communicator'' or '''CAPCOM''' and was filled by another astronaut, often one of the backup crew members.  It is believed that an astronaut is most able to understand the situation in the spacecraft and pass information in the clearest and most efficient way.

For long duration missions, there are more than one CAPCOM, each assigned to a different shift team. After control of U.S. spaceflights moved to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] in the early 1960s, each CAPCOM uses the radio [[call sign]] ''Houston.''  When non-astronauts are communicating directly with the spacecraft, CAPCOM acts as the communications controller.  CAPCOMs have sometimes been jokingly addressed as ''[[Uhura]]'', a reference to the communications expert in the TV show ''[[Star Trek]]''.

Today, non-astronauts from the Space Flight Training branch also function as CAPCOM during ISS missions, while the role is filled solely by astronauts for shuttle missions.

====Flight Surgeon (SURGEON)====
Directs all operational medical activities concerned with the mission, including the status of the flight crew. Monitors crew health, provides crew consultation, and advises flight director of the crew's health status.  A direct communications loop can be established between the mission astronauts and the flight surgeon, in accordance with doctor-patient confidentiality.

====Public Affairs Officer (PAO)====
Provides mission commentary to supplement and explain air-to-ground transmissions and flight control operations to the news media and the public.

=== Apollo flight control positions ===
The flight control positions used during the Apollo era predominantly were identical to the positions used for the Mercury and Gemini vehicles.  This was because of the similarity of the vehicle design of the capsules used for the three programs.

====Booster Systems Engineer (BOOSTER)====
Monitored and evaluated performance of propulsion-related aspects of the launch vehicle during prelaunch and ascent. During the Apollo program there were three Booster positions, who worked only until [[Trans Lunar Injection|Trans Lunar Injection (TLI)]]; after that, their consoles were vacated. Booster had the power to send an abort command to the spacecraft.  All Booster technicians were employed at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and reported to JSC for the launches.

====Control Officer (CONTROL)====
Responsible for the [[Lunar Module]] guidance, navigation and control systems. Essentially the equivalent of the GNC for the Lunar Module.

====Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager (EECOM)====
Monitored [[cryogenic]] levels for [[fuel cell]]s, and cabin cooling systems; electrical distribution systems; cabin pressure control systems; and vehicle lighting systems. EECOM originally stood for Electrical, Environmental and COMmunication systems. The [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] EECOM was responsible for CSM communications through [[Apollo 10]]. Afterward the communication task was moved to a new console named INCO.

Perhaps the most famous NASA EECOMs are [[Seymour Liebergot|Seymour "Sy" Liebergot]], the EECOM on duty at the time of the oxygen tank explosion on [[Apollo 13]] and [[John Aaron]], who is credited with saving the [[Apollo 12]] mission after the spacecraft was struck by lightning during launch.

====Flight Activities Officer (FAO)====
Planned and supported crew activities, checklists, procedures and schedules.

====Flight Dynamics Officer (FDO or FIDO)====
Responsible for the flight path of the space vehicle, both atmospheric and [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]]. During lunar missions the FDO was also responsible for the lunar [[trajectory]]. The FDO monitored vehicle performance during the powered flight phase and assessed abort modes, calculated orbital maneuvers and resulting trajectories, and monitored vehicle flight profile and energy levels during [[re-entry]].

====Guidance Officer (GUIDANCE or GUIDO)====
Monitored onboard [[Apollo PGNCS|navigational systems]] and onboard [[Apollo Guidance Computer|guidance computer]] software. Responsible for determining the position of the spacecraft in space. One well-known Guidance officer was [[Steve Bales]], who gave the "go" call when the [[Apollo 11]] [[Apollo guidance computer|guidance computer]] came close to overloading during the first lunar descent.

====Guidance, Navigation, and Controls Systems Engineer (GNC)====
Monitored all vehicle guidance, navigation and control systems. Also responsible for propulsion systems such as the Reaction and Control System (RCS) and the CSM main engine.

During lunar missions the RETRO planned and monitored Trans Earth Injection (TEI) maneuvers, where the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo Service Module]] fired its engine to return to earth from the moon.

====Telemetry, Electrical, EVA Mobility Unit Officer (TELMU)====
Monitored the [[Lunar Module]] electrical and environmental systems, plus lunar astronaut spacesuits. Essentially the equivalent of the EECOM for the Lunar Module.

===Shuttle flight control positions===
Many Apollo program mission control positions were carried forward to the space shuttle program. However, other positions were eliminated or redefined, and new positions were added.

Positions remaining generally the same:
* Booster

=== ISS flight control positions ===
The International Space Station flight control positions used by NASA in Houston are different than those used by previous NASA programs.  This is due primarily to reduce confusion from having the same name used in two different rooms during the same operations, such as when the space shuttle is conducting mated operations with the space station.  There are also differences in the control positions because of the different nature in the way the space station operates compared to the space shuttle.  The following is a list of those flight controllers located in Mission Control Center - Houston.  There are several other control centers which house dozens of other flight controllers that support the vastly complex vehicle.

====Assembly and Checkout Officer (ACO)====
Responsible for integration of assembly and activation tasks for all ISS systems and elements and coordinating with station and shuttle flight controllers on the execution of these operations.

====Attitude Determination and Control Officer (ADCO)====
Works in partnership with Russian controllers to determine and manage the station’s orientation, controlled by the onboard Motion Control Systems. This position also plans and calculates future orientations and maneuvers for the station and is responsible for docking the ISS with other vehicles.

'''MPSR positions'''
* ''HawkI'' - Pronounced (Hawk-eye) - provides expert support monitoring of all US GNC systems, leaving the ADCO to coordinate with other flight controllers and MCC-M.  Hawki is actually a strung-together set of common engineering abbreviations for quantities that affect or reflect ISS attitude, primarily chosen because they fit well enough to make a name:
** H - Momentum.  The ISS attitude control algorithm uses momentum exchange through each orbit to minimize propellant usage.
