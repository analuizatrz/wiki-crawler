'''Channel M''' is a television station which is based in [[Manchester]]. Originally named "[[Manchester Student Television]]", the channels output is designed for the Greater Manchester region of England. It began broadcasting on 14 February 2000.

The main sources of content used to be [[CHUM Limited|CHUM]], [[Euronews]], Channel M's In-House Productions and the [[University of Salford]]. However, recently there has been considerable investment and the development of a raft of own developed content, focussing on news, music, lifestyle  and sport in Manchester.

==Receiving Channel M==
It is available in analogue [[free to air]] on channel 39 (615 MHz) in some western and southern areas of Greater Manchester, and on digital [[Virgin Media]] cable channel 878 around [[Greater Manchester]], [[Lancashire|Mid-Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]]. 

In [[April 2006]], it became the first [[Restricted Service Licence|RSL]] TV station to broadcast via satellite and is available on [[Sky Digital (UK)|Sky Digital]] on channel 203. This gave the television station UK-wide coverage on the BSkyB service. The channel also become the first broadcster in the region to offer its programmes on demand via broadband TV on its website [http://www.channelm.co.uk]

==Channel M News==
The main focus for Channel M is its news and current affairs programming. The weekday evening news service '''Channel M News Live''' is filmed at 5pm  and repeated in half-hour bulletins from 5.30-7pm as '''Channel M News'''. In 2006 the '''Channel M News At Nine''' was launched and broadcasts from 9-10pm, providing a more in-depth look at the city's news stories. 

Channel M News Bulletins are filmed at the Channel M News Studio located in The [[Urbis]] Museum in [[Manchester City Centre]]. Until [[August 2005]] the news service was broadcast from [[The Printworks]] entertainment complex which is nearby.  

Channel M News is anchored by former [[BBC North West]] presenters Andy Crane and Heather Stott. '''City Life''' Anchor and Manchester Evening News Columnist Byron Evans also features regularly as a Channel M News Presenter.

==Original Programming==
The channel's biggest success seems recently to be 'Frank Sidebottom's Proper Telly Show in b/w' along with its particularly strong music coverage; hardly surprising given the city's musical heritage. With these shows, the channel is starting to attract a lot of interest nationally. 

Sport programming such as '''Talking Sharks''', '''FC United-The Fans' Club''', '''Seconds Out''' and '''Inside MCFC''' broadcast news and content from Greater Manchester's sporting teams.

Music and entertainment programming is broadcast at the 8pm slot and through the daytime schedule. '''City Life''', '''The Great Northern Music Show''', '''Style In The City''' and '''City Centre Social''' feature celebrity interviews; music, food and fashion news from around Manchester.

At 4pm and intervals throughout the day '''Manchester Music''' is broadcast, which almost replaces the [[CHUM Television]]'s North American music output on the channel.

Travel-Style Magazine '''I Love Manchester''' is an hour long review, showcasing an area of Manchester in each episode. The programme explores entertainment, fashion, food and a hidden side to parts of city.

==The Future==
After music guru [[Anthony Wilson]]'s switch from [[ITV Granada]], He will present a new friday evening entertainment show called '''The New Friday'''. In early 2007 Channel M will launch a weekday Breakfast show which will be filmed from the Channel M News studio. New travel and weather information will feature in the '''Channel M News''' bulletins and the Breakfast show.

==Manchester Media==
Other broadcasting headquarters in Manchester include the [[Granada Television]] base and the [[BBC]] Northern England headquarters. Channel M is owned by the [[Guardian Media Group]] which also publishes [[The Guardian]] National Newspaper and The [[Manchester Evening News]].

In 2005, the channel won the "Best Newcomer" award at the [[Royal Television Society]] Awards.
