'''Jahn Teigen''' is a Norwegian singer and musician. Jahn was born on [[September 27]], [[1949]], in the Norwegian city of [[Tønsberg]]. He represented Norway in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] three times, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]] respectively. His given name was Jan, he added the silent H later.
==Biography==
===Popol Vuh===
Jahn Teigen started his career already in the late 1960s, when he released a few singles and one album with Enemies. However, his commercial break-through didn't come until the early 1970ies as the [[lead singer]] of the six member [[rock band]] [[Popol Vuh (Norwegian band)|Popol Vuh]]. They released three successful albums, the first self-titled in [[1973]]. Their most popular album was released in [[1976]], called ''Stolen From Time'', but this time under their new name [[Popol Vuh (Norwegian band)|Popol Ace]], to avoid confusion with the [[Popol Vuh (German band)|German rock band]] with the same name that also was popular in the 1970s. Popol Vuh is actually a Maya Indian word in the quiche language, which means ''book of the community''. Popol Vuh/Popol Ace was actually a refinement of the even older eight member group Arman Sumpe den eldre. During [[1971]] and first half of [[1972]], Arman Sumpe d.e. was on an ever-lasting concert tour throughout Norway playing more than 140 concerts. Jahn performed at one of Europe's two largest music festivals, the [[Roskilde Festival]], already in [[1969]] with the band Red Squares, but it was first in [[1972]] he became one of the major attractions as part of Popol Vuh.

===Prima Vera===
Jahn Teigen also were a part of the Norwegian humour trio [[Prima Vera]], with [[Herodes Falsk]] [http://www.herodesfalsk.no] and [[Tom Mathisen]], who released seven albums between 1977 and 1983. Most of their reportoire consists of popular hits with the most ridiculous lyrics. (This struck a chord with the Norwegian audience, since, at the time, to ensure airplay, English-language songs often were re-recorded with Norwegian lyrics.) Their breakthrough album, 1978s ''Brakara'', went to number 1 in the charts and sold more than 100,000 copies, and includes Teigen's spirited mock-Russian rendition of [[Mil etter Mil]], ''Zagra Znja Zagra''. This 30-second version is the only available recording of the original arrangement; whether in English or Norwegian, Jahn Teigen's serious recordings of the song feature more electric guitar. The serious version was also a huge hit, making Teigen one of the few performers ever to have success with both a serious version and a parody of the same song simultaneously. Prima Vera had a number of hits, including such classics as ''Så lykkelig i Sverige'', ''Det er Norge som er bra'' and ''De gærne har det godt''.

===Eurovision===
In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] in [[Paris]] Jahn Teigen debuted on the Eurovision stage, performing the song ''Mil etter mil'' (''Mile after mile''), which became famous for not receiving a single point from any of the participating nations. This was the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Nul points|first occurrence of zero points]] with the new, and current, voting system of the Eurovision Song Contest. Despite the obvious lack of international recognition, the song gained a huge audience back in Norway where his countrymen embraced it. The single dominated the national single chart for more than four months, being among the ten most bought singles for no less than 19 consecutive weeks, for five of those peaking the chart being the most popular international hit of the nation. Still, having been in the nation's spotlight for more than 30 years now, this remains his most successful hit. Teigen's runner up single was called ''Jeg gi'kke opp'', meaning ''I don't give up'', and his first album release the same year was just as self-ironic, as it was entitled ''This Year's Loser''.

Jahn Teigen returned to the [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] stage in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] in [[Harrogate]], [[United Kingdom]], where he sang ''Adieu'' in duet with [[Anita Skorgan]] - with whom he was married for some years and has a daughter with - ending up at 12th place. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]], in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], he went solo again, with Anita Skorgan and some kids as backing vocals, with the melody ''Do re mi'', composed together with Anita Skorgan, which rendered him his finest position, a respectable 9th place. Jahn is the artist who has taken part in the Norwegian national Eurovision final, called the ''[[Melodi Grand Prix]]'', the most times, more precisely fourteen; 1974, 1975, 1976 (''Voodoo''), 1978, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1988 (''Glasnost''), 1989 (''Optimist''), 1990 (''Smil''), 1993, 1994, 1996 and once again as late as in 2005 with ''My Heart Is My Home''.

===Extensive recording material===
Teigen has released 17 albums as a soloist as of January 1, 2006. Six of these were best of collections, the last two being ''Jahn Teigens beste'' in [[1994]] and ''Fra null til gull'' (''From nul till gold'' or ''From zero to hero'' as Teigen stated he would call an English release) in [[2004]], celebrating his 35+ years as popular artist. His most successful albums to date were ''En dags pause'' (''One day's break'') released in [[1979]], ''Mentalkrem'' (''Mental cream'') in [[1980]] and ''Klovn uten scene'' (''Clown without stage'') in [[1988]].

==Trivia==
Jahn Teigen actually turned down an offer from [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], to audition (along with several other notable and not so notable vocalists) as a possible [[Peter Gabriel]] replacement.
