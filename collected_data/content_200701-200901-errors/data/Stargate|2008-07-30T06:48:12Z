'''Stargate''' refers to the [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] owned by [[MGM]] that began in [[1994]] with the [[feature film]] ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. The subsequent body of works detail an elaborate [[fictional universe]] where [[Earth]] battles hostile [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] possessing superior technology or supernatural powers. The film's story is continued in [[Stargate literature|novel]] form, in two [[live-action]] [[television series]] (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''), one [[cartoon|animated]] series (''[[Stargate Infinity]]''), and in other [[List of Stargate works|derivative works]]. Due to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various Stargate productions are not entirely consistent with each other: no set of works forms a "correct" or official [[canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref name="GateWorld Brad Wright Interview">{{cite interview|last=Wright|first=Brad|subjectlink=Brad Wright|interviewer=Darren Sumner|program= [[GateWorld]]|city=[[Chicago]]|date=July 2002}}</ref> The largest [[fanbase]] exists for the story that begins with the original film, and continues with ''Stargate SG-1'' ([[1997]]&ndash;[[2007]]) and ''Stargate Atlantis'' (since [[2004]]).<ref name="GateWorld Omnipedia FAQ 5">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/faq.shtml#5|title=GateWorld Omnipedia FAQ}}: FAQ #5 summarises canonicity</ref>

==Premise==
Stargate productions centre on the premise of a "[[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]", a ring-shaped alien device that creates a [[wormhole]] enabling personal [[teleportation]] to complementary devices located cosmic distances away.<ref name="SG1 Official">{{cite web|url=http://www.stargatesg-1.com|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Official Site}} ''FAQ Section''</ref> Under the control of the United States government, the Stargate's existence is kept secret from the public.

Together, this allows for stories predominated by human interaction in Earth-like environments, an unusual feature for a science fiction franchise.

In the story, this is explained as being the result of alien interference in Earth's distant past. Many ancient [[mythology|mythologies]] are shown to be the result of aliens who had visited Earth posing as [[polytheism|gods]]<ref name="primer">{{cite web | url=http://www.gateworld.net/articles/features/primer/index.shtml | title=Stargate Primer | work=GateWorld}}</ref> by using their technology to give the impression of deific power.<ref name="mythology">{{cite web | url=http://www.stargatefan.com/references/mythology/index.html | title = Mythological References in ''Stargate SG-1''|work=StargateFan}}</ref> Whilst some of these aliens had benign intentions, a race later known in ''Stargate SG-1'' as the "[[Goa'uld]]" used Stargates to move slaves from [[Ancient Egypt]] to other habitable planets, simultaneously being responsible for the Egyptian [[religion]] and [[culture]]. Following a successful rebellion, they fled Earth, and the Stargate was buried and forgotten until modern times, when the United States acquired it following an archaeological dig. Rediscovering the function of the Stargate, the galaxy is begotten as a source of knowledge, as well as threats, and the attention of the Goa'uld is drawn once more to Earth.

{{main|Stargate (film)}}

In [[1994]], the [[science fiction]]/[[action film|action]] [[feature film]] ''Stargate'' was released, directed by [[Roland Emmerich]] and co-written by [[Dean Devlin]]. This marked the beginning of the Stargate franchise. Originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films,<ref name="Originally Trilogy">{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/devlin-potential-stargate-trilogy_article_35086.html|title=Mania.Com ''Cinescape Exclusive''}} ''Devlin on potential Stargate trilogy''.</ref> creators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin ultimately moved on to produce ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'', and it was not until [[2006]] that Devlin showed renewed interest in developing sequels.<ref name="Devlin on Sequels">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537|title=ComingSoon.Net}} ''Devlin Announces Plans for Stargate Sequels'' ([[2006-07-20]]).</ref> In the intervening time, as [[MGM]] owned the rights to the franchise, the [[television series]] ''Stargate SG-1'' succeeded the film without the input of Emmerich and Devlin. ''Stargate'' took in $16.7 million on its opening weekend,<ref name="LA Times Stargate Opening Weekend">{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/2197992.html?dids=2197992&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS&type=current&date=Nov+1%2C+1994&author=Dutka%2C+Elaine&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=F3&desc=%27Stargate%27+has+MGM+starry-eyed|title=L.

The film lays the foundation for all the Stargate productions that come after it, by explaining the notion, function and history of the Stargate. The opening scenes of the film depict the unearthing of the Stargate at [[Giza]] in 1928, being the effective beginning of the entire Stargate story. Later in the [[Present Day]] (i.e. 1994), the main character [[Daniel Jackson]] is introduced as a failing [[egyptologist]] who is defending outlandish theories about the builders of the [[Pyramids of Giza|Pyramids]], alluding to a [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|non-human]] origin. His theories are noticed by the [[U.S. Air Force]], who hire him to help decipher the [[hieroglyphs]] present on the [[cover stone]]s that were found with the Giza Stargate, now housed at a military base.

Jackson manages to correctly translate the name "Stargate" from the stones, and furthermore discovers that the symbols depicted on the inner ring of the Stargate correspond to [[constellations]]. These symbols are found in groups of seven on [[cartouche]]s, causing Jackson to theorise that the first six constellations mark six points in space that can be used to extrapolate a singular new location, and a seventh to mark the current location ("point of origin"), thereby describing an [[interstellar]] journey. At this point he is shown the Stargate itself, which, when powered, can be operated so that up to seven of the symbols on its ring "lock" into place. Before Jackson's revelation, only six had ever been successfully "locked". Jackson is able to identify the seventh and final constellation marking the point of origin (i.e. Earth), and the Stargate opens.

A watery vortex forms inside the inner ring. A probe is pushed through, and its position is tracked on a screen; it is shown to be travelling across the galaxy, finally stopping a cosmic distance away. Footage sent back from the probe reveals a habitable atmosphere inside what appears to be a temple on [[Abydos (Stargate)|another planet]]. Colonel [[Jack O'Neill|Jack O'Neil]] is ordered to take a team through the Stargate to identify if there are any military threats on the other side. If so, he is to destroy the Stargate at the destination with a [[nuclear bomb]], making it impossible for those threats to travel backwards through the gate to Earth. As the Stargate works only in one direction at a time, Daniel Jackson is incorporated into Jack O'Neil's team so that he can decipher the cartouche they hope to find on the other end, thereupon allowing the team to return home.

On the other side, O'Neil's team discovers a [[slave]] civilization serving an [[Ra (Stargate)|alien]] who is posing as the Egyptian god [[Ra]]. He and his minion-gods take human form, commanding the slaves with [[tyranny|brute force]] from a [[Ha'tak|mothership]] that uses a Pyramid as a landing-pad (confirming Daniel Jackson's theories), and several smaller [[Death Glider|attack ships]]. The team befriend these people, and Jackson is even unwittingly married to a local [[Sha're|woman]]. However, the team is ultimately captured by Ra's forces, who also take possession of O'Neil's nuclear weapon, which Ra intends to send back to Earth through the Stargate with an enhanced [[warhead]] increasing its destructive power a hundredfold. After much struggle, O'Neil's team are able to instigate a [[slave rebellion]], overwhelming Ra's forces and causing Ra to escape in his mothership. Unable to disarm the warhead, O'Neil is able to instead [[teleport]] it on-board Ra's ship, where it detonates in orbit. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with the wife he has fallen in love with.

===''Stargate SG-1''===

[[Image:Sg1-poster.jpg|thumb|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.]]
{{main|Stargate SG-1}}

In 1997, [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]] co-developed ''Stargate SG-1'', a [[television series]] intended to continue the story laid down by the original film. Although new actors were cast, several roles from the film were reprised, including the main characters Daniel Jackson and Jack O'Neill (which was re-spelled to include an extra "L"; this variation goes alongside a [[Differences between Stargate and Stargate SG-1|host of differences]] between the original film and ''SG-1'' that are documented on several [[fansite]]s).<ref name="SG-1 Film Differences">{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/stargatefilm/differencesfromtv.htm|title=Stargate - The Motion Picture}} ''Differences from TV''.</ref> The series debuted on [[Showtime]] on [[July 27]] [[1997]], and moved to the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] after its fifth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-08/14/12.30.sfc|title=Announcement from SciFi Channel|work=SciFi Wire}}</ref> It starred [[Richard Dean Anderson]] (as [[Jack O'Neill|O'Neill]]) and [[Michael Shanks]] (as [[Daniel Jackson|Jackson]]), alongside [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Christopher Judge]] and [[Don S. Davis]] playing the new characters [[Samantha Carter]], [[Teal'c]] and [[George Hammond]].

The cast has remained fairly regular for most of ''SG-1'''s run, but has experienced some changes. [[Michael Shanks]] left the show at the end of Season 5 and was replaced by [[Corin Nemec]] as [[Jonas Quinn]].  Shanks returned at the beginning of Season 7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season 7 [[Don S. Davis|Davis]] left the show and [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]] filled the gap he left in the story. Season 9 saw the departure of [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]], but added new regulars [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Ben Browder]]. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, [[Claudia Black]]'s popular reception<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/claudia_black_01.htm|title=Interview &mdash; Vala joins ''SG-1'' regulars|work=SciFi World}}</ref> earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.

[[MGM]] put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regards it as one of its most important franchises.<ref name="Stargate 200">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6332083.html|title=''Stargate 200'': 10 years of ''Stargate'' success|work=MultiChannel}}</ref> It has won the [[Saturn Award]] for ''Best Syndicated Television Series'' on numerous occasions, and its cast has won similar awards for acting.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118480/awards|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Awards and Nominations|work=IMDb}}</ref> More recently it has received acclaim for its [[visual effect]]s, which increased in quality and realism as the show gained a larger budget.<ref name="vfx">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/05/istargatei_grew_cutting_edge_vfx.shtml|title=Stargate  grows cutting edge VFX industry|work=GateWorld}}</ref>

The series begins one year after the original film in its internal chronology. It chronicles the activities of [[SG-1]], the first exploratory team of the newly-formed [[Stargate Command]], after an enemy attack through the Stargate alerts the [[United States Air Force]] that Ra was not the last of [[Goa'uld|his species]] (as was stated in the film). The series continues where the film left off, creating a full and rich mythology and a strong cast of recurring characters.

''Stargate SG-1'' proved to be very popular. Each year from Seasons 5 to 8 the show was repeatedly expected to end, but ratings continued to be high, allowing the show to break records and enter its tenth and final season (surpassing ''[[The X-Files]]'' as the longest running [[United States]] science-fiction series).

''[[Guinness World Records]]'' recognized Stargate SG-1 as the longest currently running consecutive sci-fi series in 2006. The show is second only to the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' series, which holds the title for longest running sci-fi show overall.

On [[August 21]] [[2006]], the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] announced that it would not be renewing ''Stargate SG-1'' for an eleventh season after a series of poor performances in the [[Nielsen Ratings]].<ref name="sg1 cancellation">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6364450.html?display=Breaking+News|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Said To Be Axed|work=MultiChannel News}}</ref> Many fans were enraged at the news, even creating reactionary websites to exhibit their commitment to the series.<ref name="savestargatesg1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/fans_rally_savestargatesg1.com.shtml|title=Fans Rally: SaveStargateSG1|work=GateWorld}}</ref> Spokesmen for the production have said all options for the continuation of ''SG-1'' are being considered, including complete digital broadcasting.<ref name="sg1 future">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6366152.html|title=MGM Insists ''Stargate'' Won't Shut|work=MultiChannel News}}</ref> Executive producer [[Robert C.

===''Stargate Atlantis''===

{{main|Stargate Atlantis}}
[[Image:Sga poster 1.JPG|thumb|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.]]

''Stargate Atlantis'' began as a [[spin-off]] [[television series]] from ''Stargate SG-1'' but was originally intended to succeed it following a second feature film. The second movie was planned for after the sixth season and, when ''SG-1'' was renewed for another year, for after the seventh season. When ''SG-1'' was renewed again for an eighth season, the intended film became the episode "[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]", a two-part [[season finale]], and the setting of ''Stargate Atlantis'' was moved to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]]. <ref>{{cite book | last = Gosling  | first = Sharon | authorlink = Sharon Gosling | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | origdate =  | origyear = 2005 | origmonth = July | publisher = Titan Books | location = London | id = ISBN 1-84576-116-2 | pages = 10&ndash;14 | chapter = Watergate }}</ref> This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same [[fictional universe]], and later on the two shows even began to be interconnected. The show is developed by most of the same people as ''SG-1'', and is produced in the same studios.

''Atlantis'' debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on [[July 16]], [[2004]], starring [[Joe Flanigan]] and [[Torri Higginson]] in the lead roles, with [[Rainbow Francks|Rainbow Sun Francks]], [[David Hewlett]], and [[Rachel Luttrell]] alongside. Hewlett and Higginson had previously been characters in ''SG-1''. In ''Atlantis''' second season, [[Paul McGillion]] and [[Jason Momoa]] (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season 4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and [[Jewel Staite]] in a recurring role. The series' 5th season has recently begun airing on the Sci Fi Channel.

The plot follows the adventures of the "Atlantis expedition", a combination of military forces and civilian scientists that travel to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]] in search of the Lost City of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], left behind by the most powerful race known to ever have lived, referred to as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] or for the ones living on Atlantis, Lanteans. The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of ''SG-1'''s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the ''SG-1'' setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discover that the Pegasus galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as "the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]" whom they must defend themselves against despite being vastly outnumbered.

The series has won several awards for its actors, visual effects and directors, including a [[WorldFest]] Platinum Award for [[David Winning]]'s direction of an early Season 1 episode. ''Atlantis'' proved to be equally as successful as ''SG-1'', with [[Nielson Ratings]] consistently in the regions of 1.9.
{{-}}<!--Break prevents images overflowing sections-->

===''Stargate Universe''===
{{main|Stargate Universe}}
''Stargate Universe'' is the working title for a third Stargate series which is currently in development. The idea of Stargate Universe is that it is set on a ship that was part of an Ancient experiment that was set in motion probably millions of years ago, one that they never saw to fruition, but that we can. The experiment is to send a ship across the universe, and to send one ahead of it to seed the galaxies with Stargates, and that they would one day use the ninth chevron to get to the ship.

Millions of years ago (before their conflict with the Wraith and possibly even before they moved Atlantis to the Pegasus Galaxy), the show would reveal, the Ancients sent out two ships: an automated vessel to place Stargates throughout multiple galaxies in our universe, and a second ship to follow up and explore. A standard, 7-symbol gate address allows for travel within the same galaxy. Use of the Stargate's eighth chevron allows for travel to a different galaxy. And the ninth chevron will allow the team to reach this second, still unmanned Ancient ship.

The series was pitched to SCI FI Channel last fall, just before the writer's strike -- which put a hold on the project. "The pitch was received very well," according to Stargate Atlantis co-creator Brad Wright. The third Stargate series won't be set on Earth, or on a remote base, but on a ship that travels from galaxy to galaxy. The strike and the potential cost of Stargate Universe are not the only reasons the show is not yet moving forward.

Brad Wright said that he is not anxious to return to a schedule that requires the Vancouver team to produce 40 hours of television each year, indicating that Stargate Universe may wait until Atlantis has concluded its run.

===''Stargate Infinity''===
{{main|Stargate Infinity}}

''Stargate Infinity'' was an [[animated series]] spin-off from ''Stargate SG-1'' intended for children aged 9 to 11. It ran from [[14 September]], [[2002]] to [[June 2003]] on the [[FOX]] Network. Even though the series was produced by [[MGM]] with [[DiC Entertainment]], none of the writers and producers of ''Stargate SG-1'' were involved with ''Infinity'', and it is not considered official Stargate [[canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/articles/interviews/wright01.shtml GateWorld &mdash; Interviews: Brad Wright]</ref> The show was canceled after 1 season for its poor reception and ratings.

Set 30 to 40 years in the future, ''Infinity'' tells the story of a team of young recruits led by a veteran member of [[Stargate Command]] that are framed for a crime they did not commit. The team must travel from world to world trying to find a way to clear their name, while protecting a strange alien being discovered in the first episode, which is believed to hold the secret to mysteries surrounding the Stargates and the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] race that built them. Due to its cancellation, none of the major [[plot arc]]s of the series were concluded.

The series featured a strong [[moral]] and [[edutainment|educational]] theme, purposely summarizing each episode with a distinct lesson for its young audience to learn. It focused primarily on the importance of [[teamwork|working together]] and accepting [[xenophobia|differences]] in other cultures or people, whether they be aliens or members of one's own team.

===Third Stargate Feature===

Executive producer Brad Wright revealed that a third film, centric to Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), has yet to be officially confirmed.

==Books==

{{main|Stargate literature}}

There are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' film and two based in the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' [[television show]]s. Short fiction has also been published in the official ''Stargate Magazine''. 

A series of books written by [[Bill McCay]] were published from [[1996]] to [[1999]] that were unofficial sequels to the film. These were produced by consulting the original notes made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, in an attempt to envision where the film "would have gone". Neither party has commented on whether McCay's interpretation was correct. Despite the fact that he attempted to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series ''Stargate SG-1'' (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making  no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.

Later,  from 1999 to 2001, [[ROC (publisher)|ROC]] published four novels based in ''Stargate SG-1'' written by [[Ashley McConnell]]. In 2004, [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Fandemonium|Fandemonium Press]] started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on ''Stargate SG-1''. Due to the conflict with ROC's license, these books were available in  [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006.

The official ''Stargate Magazine'', produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.

===Comics===

{{main|Stargate Comics}}

A series of [[comic book]]s, based on ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'', began to be published by [[Avatar Press]] in [[2003]]. Five have been published to date, with stories by [[James Anthony]] and artwork by [[Jorge Correa]].

===Audio books===

{{main|Stargate audiobooks}}

In February 2008 it was announced that [[Big Finish Productions]] would be releasing officially-licensed [[audiobooks]] featuring members of the cast reading new stories.

Charles Cohen, executive vice president of MGM Television, has voiced plans to develop further Stargate films and produce a third television series to be titled ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' (discounting ''Infinity'' as a Stargate television series), currently in a pre-production concept phase.<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/05/mgm_planning_stargate_film_third.shtml MGM planning Stargate film, third series]. ''Gateworld.net''</ref><ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/12/exclusive_third_istargatei_serie.shtml Exclusive: Third Stargate series in development]. ''Gateworld.net''</ref> 

Plans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film's creator [[Dean Devlin]] at the 2006 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. He has said he is currently in talks with MGM to produce four films and he would like two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy.<ref name="film_sequels">[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 Devlin Announces Plans for Stargate Sequels]</ref> In an interview with [[Sci Fi Wire]], Devlin says that should the sequels be made, he hopes to enlist [[Kurt Russell]] and [[James Spader]] in the two sequels. These sequels would ignore the 12 years of mythology created by ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' if they are produced.<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=37194&type=0 SciFi Wire Interview with Devlin]</ref>

In the meantime, Lionsgate remains the major rights holder to the original film; this was due to the fact that its predecessor, Live Entertainment, owned home video rights to the [[Carolco Pictures]] library and had also owned international distribution rights, although Carolco itself was on the brink of bankruptcy when they produced this film.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

It was announced on 10 January 2008 that a series of original Audio Dramas will be produced by British company Big Finish Productions, who are famous for producing Audio Dramas for other (mostly British) Science Fiction franchises such as [[Doctor Who]], [[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]], and [[The Tomorrow People]]. These will be made available for purchase via download and also as a CD release. The initial run of six plays will take place in both the existing SG-1 and Altantis continuities, and will feature members of the original cast.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}
