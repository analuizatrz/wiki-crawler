'''Cornelius Petrus Johannes "Corné" Krige''' (born [[21 March]] [[1975]] in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]]) was a [[South Africa]]n<ref>[http://www.sportsillustrated.co.za/static/feature/story.php?id=207 ''Sports Illustrated'': "Corne should have stayed', by Sibongile Maputi.] Retrieved 20 June 2007.</ref> [[rugby union]] footballer, now retired, who played flanker for [[Western Province (rugby)|Western Province]] in the [[Currie Cup]], the [[Stormers]] in [[Super 14|Super Rugby]] and captained the South African national side, the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]].

Corne Krige was [[Zambia]]n-born and his parents still reside in that country, but he was schooled in [[South Africa]] at [[Paarl Boys High School]], about 60km from [[Cape Town]]. He played most of his rugby for South African teams, and resides in that country.

Krige's Test debut came in 1999 after recovering from career-threatening knee and hand injuries. He captained the Springboks on his test debut in a 101-0 victory over [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] in [[Durban]]; unfortunately two weeks later he suffered another serious knee injury against the [[All Blacks]] in [[Dunedin]] which ended his hopes of captaining the Springboks at the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] in [[Wales]]. Krige appeared in 39 tests for South Africa, became the full-time captain in [[2002]],<ref name="Test retirement">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/3393271.stm "Krige quits Test rugby"], ''[[BBC]]'', 13 January 2004.</ref> and captained the Boks 18 times in all<ref name="Saints signing">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/english/3927021.stm "Saints seal Krige deal"], ''BBC'', 26 July 2004.</ref> before his international retirement in January [[2004]].<ref name="Test retirement" />

Never one to shy away from dirty play, he was the subject of controversy after the November [[2002]] Test against [[England national rugby union team|England]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] that saw England hand the Boks the worst defeat in their history (53-3). During the match, an increasingly frustrated South Africa side began targeting England players with physical off-the-ball attacks, and match footage showed Krige as the leader.<ref name="England-SA 2002">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/2525929.stm "Krige in the spotlight"], ''BBC'', 28 November 2002.</ref> His Super Rugby career then ended several weeks early when he was handed an eight-week ban for head-butting an opponent in [[2004 Super 12 season|2004]]. 

He finished his career in the [[Guinness Premiership|English Premiership]] with [[Northampton Saints]], signing for the [[2004-05 Zurich Premiership|2004-05 season]].<ref name="Saints signing" /> He retired at the end of that season and returned to Cape Town to pursue outside business interests.<ref name="Final retirement">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/english/4255471.stm "Saints star Krige to quit playing"], ''BBC'', 10 February 2005.</ref> Krige would make one more high-profile appearance on a rugby field, captaining a Western Province XV against a [[World XV]] in his [[testimonial match|testimonial]] at [[Newlands Stadium|Newlands]] on 9 June [[2006]].

Krige and former Springbok teammates [[Bobby Skinstad]] and [[Robbie Fleck]] were business partners, owning Billie the B.U.M.S. Restaurant and a Cocktail Bar in Newlands. The restaurant has since closed.

When the Boks played the [[Australia]] [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] during the later years of Krige's captaincy, he and Wallabies captain [[George Gregan]] shared an unusual distinction: both were born in the same hospital.<ref name="Courageous">[http://www.thegoal.com/players/rugby/krige_corne/captain.html "Captain Courageous: Corné Krige"], ''TheGoal.com'', retrieved 26 June 2006.</ref><ref name="SA World Cup 2003">[http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyworldcup2003/story/0,,1054302,00.html "Rugby Union World Cup Special Reports: South Africa"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 October 2003.</ref>
