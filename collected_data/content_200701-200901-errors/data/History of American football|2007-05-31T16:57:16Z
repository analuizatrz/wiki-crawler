[[American football]] is the most popular spectator sport in the [[United States]]. It is directly descended from [[rugby football]], and both games have their origin in varieties of [[football]] played in the [[United Kingdom]] in the mid-[[19th century]], in which a [[football (ball)|ball]] is kicked at a [[Goal (sport)|goal]] and/or or carried over a line. Thus the '''history of American football''' is an important part of both the [[culture of the United States]] and the broader history of various football games around the world.

==Early years (before 1869)==

===First collegiate games===

Ball games were played informally in the United States going back to colonial times.  The games remained largely unorganized until the 19th century, when [[intramural sports|intramural]] games of football began to be played on college campuses throughout the U.S.  Each school played its own variety of football.  [[Princeton University|Princeton]] students are reported to have played a game called "ballown" as early as 1820.  A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] tradition known as "Bloody Monday" began in 1827, consiting of a large mass ball game between the freshman and sophomore classes.  [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] played its own version called "[[Old division football]]," the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1820's.  All of these games, and many more, shared certain commonalities.  They were largely "mob" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary.  Rules were simple and violence and injury were common.<ref name=PFRA1>{{cite web | title = No Christian End! | work = THE JOURNEY TO CAMP: The Origins of American Football to 1889 | publisher = Professional Football Researchers Association | url = http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=c-to1870 | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref><ref name=ODF>{{cite web | last = Meacham | first = Scott | title = Old Division Football, The Indigenous Mob Soccer Of Dartmouth College (pdf) | publisher = dartmo.com | date = 2006 | url = http://www.dartmo.com/football/Football_Meacham.pdf | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref>
 
The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and their ultimate downfall.  [[Yale University|Yale]], under pressure from the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard followed suit in 1861.<ref name=PFRA1/>

===The "Boston game"===

While the game was being banned in colleges, it was growing in popularity in various [[New England]] [[prep school]]s.  In 1855, manufactured inflatable balls were introduced.  These were much more regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying more skillful.  Two competing versions had evolved during this time; the "kicking game" which resembelled [[soccer]] and the "running" or "carrying game" which resembelled [[rugby union|rugby]].  A hybrid of the two, known as the "Boston game," was played by a group known as the [[Oneida Football Club]].  The club, considered by some historians as the first formal [[football club]] in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the "Boston game" on [[Boston Common]].  They played mostly among themselves early on; though they organized a team of non-members to play a game in November, 1863, which the Oneidas won easily.  The game caught the attention of the press, and the "Boston game" continued to grow throughout the 1860's.<ref name=PFRA1/><ref>{{cite web | last = Allaway | first = Roger | title = Were the Oneidas playing soccer or not? | work = The USA Soccer History Archives | publisher = Dave Litterer | date = 2001 | url = http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/oneidas.html | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}</ref>

==Intercollegeiate football and rules standardization (1869&ndash;1905)==

The game began to return to college campuses by the late 1860's.  Yale, Princeton, [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], and [[Brown University|Brown]] had all began playing the "kicking" game during this time.  Princeton is known to have used a form of rules based on those of the [[London Football Association]] in 1867.<ref name=PFRA1/>  The "running game" was taken up by the [[Montreal Football Club]] in [[Canada]] in 1868.<ref name=histfoot>{{cite web | title = The History of Football | work = The History of Sports | publisher = Saperecom | date = 2007 | url = http://www.historyoffootball.net/ | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}</ref>

===Rutgers v. Princeton, 1869===

On [[November 6]], [[1869]], what is widely regarded as the first [[College football|intercollegiate football]] game was played between Princeton and Rutgers.<ref name=PFRA1/><ref name=histfoot/><ref>{{cite web | title = 1800s | work = Rutgers Through The Years | publisher = Rutgers Univeristy | url = http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref><ref name=NFL1869> {{cite web | title = NFL History 1869-1910 | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910 | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}</ref>  The game was played at a Rutgers field under Rutgers rules.  Two teams of 25 players attempted to score by kicking the ball into the opposing teams goal.  Throwing or carrying the ball was not allowed.  The first team to reach six goals would be declared the winner.  Rutgers crossed the line first, winning by a score of six to four.  A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton rules (one notable difference was the awarding of a "free kick" for any player that caught the ball on the fly).  Princeton won that game by a score of eight to zero.  Both games bore a closer resemblence to soccer than to modern American football.  [[Columbia University|Columbia]] joined the series in 1870, and by 1872 several schools fielded intercollegiate teams, including Yale and [[Stevens Institute of Technology]].<ref name=PFRA1/>

===Early rules===

On [[October 19]], [[1873]], representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in [[New York City]] to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules.  Prior to this meeting, each school had its own set of rules; games were usually played using the home teams own particular code.  At this meeting, a list of 12 rules was drawn up to be used during intercollegiate football games.  These were:<ref name=PFRA1/>
#The ground shall be 400 feet long and 250 feet broad.
#The distance between the posts of each goal shall be 25 feet.
#The number for match games shall be 20 to a side.
#To win a game 6 goals are necessary, but that side shall be considered victorious which, when the game is called, shall have scored the greatest number of goals, provided that number be 2 or more. To secure a goal the ball must pass between the posts.
#No player shall throw or carry the ball. Any violation of this regulation shall constitute a foul, and the player so offending shall throw the ball perpendicularly into the air to a height of at least 12 feet and the ball shall not be in play until it has touched the ground.
#When the ball passes out of bounds it is a foul, and the player causing it shall advance at right angles to the boundary line, 15 paces from the point where the ball went, and shall proceed as in rule 5.
#No tripping shall be allowed, nor shall any player use his hands to hold or push an adversary.
#The winner of the toss shall have the choice of the first goal, and the sides shall change goals after every successive inning. In starting the ball it shall be fairly kicked, not "babied", from a point 150 feet in front of the starter's goal.
#Until the ball is kicked no player on either side shall be in advance of a line parallel to the line of his goal and distant from it 150 feet.
#There shall be two judges, one from each of the contesting colleges, and one referee; all to be chosen by the captains.
#No player shall wear spikes or iron plates upon his shoes.
#In all matches a No. 6 ball shall be used, furnished by the challenging side and to become the property of the victor.
Though clearly much closer to soccer than to modern American football, at least one part of the modern game, the kickoff, is evident from rules eight and nine.

Harvard, which played a version more closely resembling the "Boston game" that allowed carrying of the ball, refused to attend this rules conference and continued to play under its own code.  Harvard's voluntary absence from the meeting made it hard to get games against other American universities, so it agreed to play [[McGill University]], from [[Montreal]] in a two-game series.  The McGill team would travel to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] to meet Harvard in a game played under "Boston" rules, followed by a game of rugby.  On [[May 14]], [[1874]], the first game, played under "Boston" rules was won easily by Harvard.  The next day, the two teams played rugby to a scoreless tie, quite a feat considering that the Harvard team had never seen the game played before then.<ref name=PFRA1/>

Harvard quickly took a liking to the rugby game, and its use of the [[touchdown]], which until that time was not a type of scoring seen in American football.  In the fall of 1874, the Harvard team traveled to Montreal to play McGill in rugby, and won by three touchdowns.  On [[November 13]], [[1875]], the first edition of [[The Game (college football)|The Game]], the annual rivalry between Harvard and Yale was played under a modified set of rugby rules known as "The Concessionary Rules".  Yale lost four to zero, but found that it too preferred the rugby style game.  Spectators from Princeton carried the game back home, where it caught on there as well.<ref name=PFRA1/>

On [[November 23]], [[1876]], representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] to standardize a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill Univeristy in 1874.  The rules were based largely on the Rugby Union Code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring.  Three of the schools, Harvard, Columbia, and Princton would form the [[Intercollegiate Football Association]] as a result of the meeting.  Yale at first refused over a disagreement about the number of players per team; they would join the group in 1879.<ref name=PFRA2> {{cite web | title = Camp and His Followers: American Football 1876-1889 | work = THE JOURNEY TO CAMP: The Origins of American Football to 1889 | publisher = Professional Football Researchers Association | url = http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=d-to1889 | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref>

===Walter Camp: Father of American football===

[[Walter Camp]] is widely considered to be the most important figure in establishing the modern game of American football as a unique game apart from its rugby roots.<ref name=PFRA2/><ref name=histfoot/><ref name=NFL1869/>  As a youth he excelled in many sports, from [[track and field|track]] and watersports, to [[baseball]] and soccer.  In 1876, he enrolled at Yale excelled at several sports, earning varsity honors in every sport the school offered.<ref name=PFRA2/>

Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House "conventions" where rules were debated and changed.  His first meeting came in 1878, where he proposed his first rule change: a reduction in team size from fifteen players to eleven.  The motion was rejected.  At the 1879 convention, he proposed that a [[Safety (football score)|safety]] should count as a score, and this proposal was rejected as well.  In 1880, his first rule change, the establishment of eleven-a-side football, was passed.  The effect was to open the game up and emphasize speed over streghth.  Also at the 1880 rules meeting, the rule that Camp is most famous for, the one that established the [[line of scrimmage]] and the [[Snap (football)|snap]] from [[center (American football)|center]] to [[quarterback]], was passed.  Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center.  Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.<ref name=PFRA2/>

Camp's new scrimmage rules revolutionized the game, though not always for the better.  Princeton in particular would use scrimmage play to slow the game down, making incremental progress each down towards the end zone.  Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent behind the rule, it was being exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests.  At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three [[Down (football)|downs]].  With the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the down-and-distance rules, the game was no longer a modified form of rugby, and American Football as a distinct sport was born.<ref name=PFRA2/>

Camp was central to several more rule changes that are familiar as important aspects of American football.  In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimmensions of 120 yards by 53 1/3 yards.  Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at awarding touchdowns four points, while [[Extra point|kicks after touchdowns]] were worth two, safeties worth two, and [[Field goal (football)|field goals]] worth five.  In 1887, the game timing was set as two halves of 45 minutes each.  Also in 1887, two paid official per game, a [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]] and an [[Official (American football)#Umpire|umpire]], were mandated.  In 1888, rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist.  In 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.<ref name=PFRA2/>

After leaving Yale in 1882, Camp was employed by the New Haven Clock Company until his death in 1925.  Though no longer a player, he remained a fixture at annual rules meetings for most of his life, and he personally selected an annual [[All-America|All-American team]] every year from 1898 through 1924.  To this day, the Walter Camp Foundation continues to select All-American teams in his honor.<ref name=camp>{{cite web | title = Walter Camp : 1859 - 1925 | work = Walter Camp History Page | publisher = The Walter Camp Foundation | url = http://www.waltercamp.org/history5.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref>

===Expansion of college football===

College football expanded greatly during the last two decades of the nineteenth century.  In 1880, eight universities fielded intercollegiate teams.<ref>{{cite web | title = 1880 season | work = Dolphin Historical Football Ratings | publisher = Dolphin Sim | date = 2005 | url =  http://www.dolphinsim.com/ratings/cf_hist/final1880.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> By 1900, the number had expanded to 43.<ref>{{cite web | title = 1900 season | work = Dolphin Historical Football Ratings | publisher = Dolphin Sim | date = 2005 | url =  http://www.dolphinsim.com/ratings/cf_hist/final1900.html |accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>  Many major [[List of NCAA college football rivalry games|rivalries]] date from this time period, including [[Iron Bowl|Alabama-Auburn]], [[Army-Navy Game|Army-Navy]], and [[Michigan-Ohio State rivalry|Michigan-Ohio State]].

In 1879, [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan]] became the first team west of Pennsylvania to establish a college football team.  Other midwestern schools soon followed suit, including the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|The University of Minnesota]]. The Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives (also known as the Western Confernce), precursor to the [[Big Ten Conference]], was founded in 1895 as the nation's first college football league.<ref>{{cite web | title = Big Ten History | work = Big Ten Conference - Official Athletic Site -Traditions | date = 2007 | url = http://bigten.cstv.com/trads/big10-trads.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> 

Led by legendary coach [[Fielding Yost]], Michigan became the first "western" national power by the turn of the twentieth century.  From 1901-1905, Michigan had a 56 game undefeated streak that included the 1902 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] game, a streak where Michigan scored 2,831 points while only allowing 40.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 16</ref>  Another legendary coach spent most of his career in the Western Conference, [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] of the Univsersity of Chicago.  He coached first at the [[Springfield College|Springfield International YMCA Training School]], then Chicago, and later at the [[University of the Pacific]] for a total of 57 years, to this day a record.  As of 2007, he still ranked seventh on the list of winningest football coaches of all time with 314 wins.  Ranked sixth on the same list, with 319 wins, is [[Pop Warner|Glenn "Pop" Warner]], who began is coaching career in 1895 with the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Nance | first = Roscoe | title = Legendary Grambling coach Eddie Robinson dies | work = USA TODAY | date = April 4, 2007 | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2007-04-04-eddie-robinson-obit_N.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-19}} - A chart near the bottom of the article lists the top 10 winningest coaches of all time.</ref>

===Violence and controvery===

From its earliest days as a mob game, football was a violent sport.<ref name=PFRA1/>  The 1894 Harvard/Yale game, known as the "Hampden Park Blood Bath" resulted in four players receiving crippling injuries; the rivalry was suspended until 1897.  The annual Army-Navy game was suspended from 1894-1898 for similar reasons.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 16-18</ref>  One of the major problems was the popularity of mass-formations like the [[flying wedge]] where a large number of offensive players charged as a unit against a similarly arranged defense.  The resultant collisions often led to serious injuries and death.<ref> Bennett (1976), pp 20 </ref> 

The situation came to a head in 1905 when there were 19 fatalities nationwide.  [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] threatened to shut the game down if drastic changes were not made.  One rule change introduced in 1905, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass.  Though it would go under utilized for many years, this would prove to be the last and one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 18</ref>  On [[December 28]], [[1905]] 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer.  As a result of this meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) was formed.<ref name=NCAA> {{cite web | title = The History of the NCAA | work = NCAA.org | publisher = National Collegiate Athletic Association | url = http://www.ncaa.org/about/history.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>

==Modernization and innovation (1906&ndash;1930)==

After the 1905-1906 reforms, mass formation plays became illegal, the forward pass became legal, and several coaches emerged to take advantage of these sweeping changes that were introduced to the game.  Amos Alonzo Stagg introduced such innovations as the [[huddle]], the tackling dummy, and the pre-snap shift.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 17 </ref>  Other coaches, such as Pop Warner and [[Knute Rockne]] would make sweeping changes to the game's strategy that remain to this day.

Besides the coaching innovations, several rules changes during the first third of the twentieth century had a profound impact on the game, mostly in opening up the passing game.  In 1914, the first roughing-the-passer rule was implemented.  In 1918, the rules on eligible receivers were loosened.<ref> Vancil (2000) pp 22</ref>.  Scoring rules also changed during this time, when field goals were lowered to three points each in 1909,<ref name=NFL1869/> and touchdowns raised to six points each in 1912.<ref name=NFL1911> {{cite web | title = NFL History 1911-1920 | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1911-1920 | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}</ref>

Star players that emerged in the early twentieth century included Jim Thorpe, [[Red Grange]], and [[Bronko Nagurski]]; these three would make the transition to the fledgling NFL and help turn it into a successful league.  Sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]] helped popularize the sport with his poetic descriptions and colorful nicknames for the game's biggest players, including Grange, whom he dubbed "The Galloping Ghost," Notre Dame's "[[Four Horsemen (football)|Four Horsemen]]" backfield, and [[Fordham University]]'s "[[Seven Blocks of Granite]]".<ref>Vancil (2000) pp 24 </ref>

===Pop Warner===

Glenn "Pop" Warner coached at several schools throughout his career, including The University of Georgia, [[Cornell University]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|The University of Pittsburgh]], [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]], [[Temple Owls football|Temple University]].<ref name=coaches> Bennett (1976), pp 20-21</ref> He most famous stint was probably the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]], where he coached [[Jim Thorpe]], first president of the [[National Football League]], [[1912 Summer Olympics|Olympic Gold Medalist]], and widely considered one of the best atheletes in history.<ref> {{cite web | title =  ESPN.com: Top N. American athletes of the century | publisher = ESPN.com | date = 2001 | url = http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/athletes.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref><ref> Vancil (2000), pp 20 </ref> Warner wrote one of the first important books of football strategy, ''Football for Coaches and Players''.  Though the shift was invented by Stagg, Warner's [[single wing]] and double wing [[Formation (American football)|formations]] utilized it to perfection; for almost 40 years these were the among most important formations in football.  Out of the single and double wing formations, Warner was one of the first coaches to effectively utilize the forward pass.  Among his other innovations to the game included modern blocking schemes, the three-point stance, and the [[reverse (American football)|reverse]] play.<ref name=coaches/>

===Knute Rockne===

Knute Rockne rose to prominence in 1913 as an [[end (American football)|end]] for the University of Notre Dame, then a largely unknown midwestern [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] school.  When Army scheduled Notre Dame as a warm-up game, they thought little of the small school.  Rockne and quarterback [[Gus Dorais]] made innovative use of the forward pass, still at that point a relatively unused weapon, to defeat Army 35-13 and help establish the school as national power.  Rockne would return to coach the team in 1918, and devised the powerful [[Notre Dame Box]] offense, based on Warner's single wing.  He is credited with opening up the game, being the first major coach to emphasize offense over defense.  In 1927, his complex shifts led directly to a rule change whereby all offensive players had to stop for a full second before the ball could be snapped.  Rather than simply a regional team, Rockne's Fighting Irish became famous for [[Barnstorm (athletics)|barnstorming]], and would play any team in any location.  It was during Rockne's tenure that the annual [[Jeweled Shillelagh|Notre Dame-University of Southern California rivalry]] began, one of the longest distance rivalries in the nation.  He led his team to an impressive 105-12-5 record before his premature death by plane crash in 1931.  So famous was he at that point that his funeral was broadcast nationally on radio.<ref name=coaches/><ref> Vancil (2000), pp 19-22</ref>

==College football becomes dominant (1930&ndash;1958)==

In the early 1930's, the college game blossomed in popularity.  Bolstered by fierce rivalries such as the [[Third Saturday in October|one between]] [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama's]] [[Wallace Wade]] and [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee's]] General [[Robert Neyland]], the grew in popularity in the [[Southern United States|south]].  While prior to the mid-1920's most national powers came from the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] or the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]], the situation changed when Wade's 1925 Alabama team won the 1926 Rose Bowl ''en route'' to its first national title.  Lacking any major league sports presence, the game quickly became the south's most popular spectator sport.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 24-29 </ref>

Several major modern college football conferences rose to prominence during this time period.  The [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) formed in 1932 consisting mostly of schools in the [[Deep South]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Ours | first = Robert M. | title = Southeastern Conference | work = College Football Encyclopedia | publisher = Augusta Computer Services | date = 2007 | url = http://www.footballencyclopedia.com/sechome.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref>  The [[Southwest Athletic Conference]] had been founded in 1915.  Consisting mostly of schools from  Texas, the conference saw back-to-back national champions with [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian University]] (TCU) in 1938 and [[Texas A&M Aggie football|Texas A&M]] in 1939.<ref name=1930s>McCambridge (1999), pp 124</ref><ref> {{cite web | title = A Look Back at the Southwest Conference | work = 2006-2007 Texas Almanac | publisher = The Dallas Morning News | date = 2007 | url = http://www.texasalmanac.com/history/highlights/swc/ | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref>  The [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (PCC), a precursor to the [[Pacific Ten Conference]] (Pac-10), had its own back-to-back champion in the [[USC Trojan football|University of Southern California]] which was awarded the title in 1931 and 1932.<ref name=1930s/>  As in previous decades, the Big Ten continued to dominate in the 1930's and 1940's with Minnesota winning 5 titles between 1934 and 1941, and Michigan(1933 and 1948) and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] (1942) also winning titles.<ref name=1930s/><ref name=1940s> McCambridge (1999), pp 148</ref>

National recognition of college football continued to grow in the 1930's, as it grew out of its regional affiliations.  Four new [[bowl game]]s were created: the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], [[Sugar Bowl]], and the [[Sun Bowl]] in 1935, as well as the [[Cotton Bowl (game)|Cotton Bowl]] in 1937.  In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl game, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that would not otherwise have played.  In 1936, the [[Associated Press]] began its [[AP Poll|weekly poll]] of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams.  Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determine who would be crowned [[Mythical National Championship|National Champion]] of college football.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 30</ref>

The 1930's saw growth in the passing game as well.  Though General Neyland at Tennessee continued to eschew its use (former Tennessee quarterback Tex Davis noted, when told by Neyland that he would throw 20 or 30 times, "I didn't know he meant the whole season."<ref> Vancil 2000, pp 29</ref>) several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on throwing the ball.  In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties (a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of the possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone) and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw.  Players who became famous for taking advantage of the easier passing game included Alabama receiver [[Don Hutson]] and TCU passer [[Sammy Baugh|"Slingin' Sammy Baugh]].<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 28-30</ref>

In 1935, New York City's [[Downtown Athletic Club]] awarded the first [[Heisman Trophy]] to Chicago halfback [[Jay Berwanger]], who would also become the first ever [[NFL Draft]] pick in 1936.  The trophy was designed by scuptor [[Frank Eliscu]] and modeled after [[New York University|NYU]] player [[Ed Smith (football player)|Ed Smith]].  The trophy recognizes the nation's best college football player, and has become one of the most coveted awards in all of American sports. <ref> {{cite web | title = A Brief History of the Heisman Trophy | work = Heisman Trophy | publisher = heisman.com | url = http://www.heisman.com/history/heisman-trophy.html | date = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], many college football players enlisted in the [[Military of the United States|armed forces]].  As most of these players had eligibility left on their college careers, many returned to college at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], bringing Army back-to-back national titles in 1944 and 1945 under coach [[Earl Blaik|Red Blaik]].  [[Doc Blanchard]] (known as Mr. Inside) and [[Glenn Davis]] (known as Mt. Outside) both won the [[Heisman Trophy]], in 1945 and 1946 respectively.  On the coaching staff of those 1944-1946 Army teams was future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coach [[Vince Lombardi]].<ref name=1940s/><ref> Vancil (2000), pp 39</ref>

The 1950's saw the rise of yet more dynasties and power programs.  [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], under coach [[Bud Wilkinson]], won three national (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten [[Big Eight Conference]] championships in the decade while building a record 47 game winning streak that still stands today.  [[Woody Hayes]] led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning more [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten titles]] (three) than any other school.  Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw a revival of the running game in the 1950's.  Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game.  Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950's were runners.  Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substancial decline in success, the 1950's were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title.  [[Paul Hornung]], Notre Dame quarterback, did however win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team to ever do so.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 41-45</ref><ref name=1950s> McCambridge (1999) pp 172</ref>

==Modern college football (1958&ndash;''present'')==
Following huge television success of the [[National Football League]]'s [[1958 NFL Championship Game|1958 championship game]], the college game would soon take a back seat to the NFL in terms of national popularity.  While the college game continues to experience success and regional popularity to this day, it has not since topped the NFL in terms of national attention.<ref> McCambridge (1999), pp 171</ref><ref>Bennett (1976) pp 56</ref><ref name=greatest>{{cite web | last = Barnidge | first = Tom | title = 1958 Colts remember the 'Greatest Game' | publisher = nfl.com | date = 2000 | url = http://www.nfl.com/insider/story/6032205 | accessdate = 2007-03-21}} reprinted from Official [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] Game Program.</ref>

==The professional game (1892&ndash;1920)==

===Professionalism, 1892===
Football caught on among the general population and began to be the subject of intense competition and rivalry, albeit of a localised nature. In [[1892]], although payments to players were considered unsporting and dishonorable at the time, a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] area club, the Allegheny Athletic Association, surreptitiously hired former Yale All-American guard [[William Heffelfinger|William "Pudge" Heffelfinger]].[http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/birth.jsp] On [[November 12]], Heffelfinger became the first known professional football player. He was paid $500&mdash;a huge amount at the time&mdash;to play in a game against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Heffelfinger picked up a Pittsburgh fumble and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, winning the game 4-0 for Allegheny. Although many observers held suspicions, the payment remained a secret for many years.

On [[September 3]], [[1895]] the first wholly professional game was played, in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], between the Latrobe [[YMCA]] and the Jeannette Athletic Club. Latrobe won the contest 12-0.

===After 1912===
In the early years of the [[20th century]], [[college football]] was the predominant form of American football. Innovations in strategy and style of play originated in college football and spread to the pro game gradually. It was not until much later that professional leagues surpassed the university football competitions in standing and influence.

[[Jim Thorpe]], a two-time gold medal winner in the [[1912 Olympics|1912 Stockholm Olympics]] and former college football star, began playing pro football in 1913, giving the pro sport its first legitimate star. In the 1910s, the most influential professional league was the Ohio League, dominated by the rivalry between the [[Massillon Tigers]] and Canton Bulldogs. Thorpe was eventually signed to play for Canton.  In 1919, [[Curly Lambeau]] organized the Green Bay (Meat) Packers as a full-fledged professional team, funded by the Indian Packing Company. The [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] are the longest lasting professional football franchise in the same location in history.

==Establishment of the NFL (1920&ndash;1945)==
[[Image:1932 NFL playoff game.jpg|thumb|300px|1932 &mdash; the first ever NFL playoff game, played indoors at [[Chicago Stadium]]. The final result was [[Chicago Bears]] 9, [[Portsmouth Spartans]] 0.]]  While attention in most areas was still paid to football at elite colleges, the professional game spread widely in the Midwest. In [[1920]], the first pro league, the [[National Football League|American Professional Football Association]], was founded, in a meeting at a [[Hupmobile]] car dealership in [[Canton, Ohio]]. The legendary [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] and all-round athlete [[Jim Thorpe]] was elected president. The initial group of 11 teams, of which all but one were located in the Midwest, was originally less a league than an agreement not to rob other teams' players. In the early years, APFA members continued to play non-APFA teams.  By the start of the 1920 season, the list of teams had grown to 14. They were: 

* [[Akron Pros]]
* [[Buffalo All-Americans]]
* [[Canton Bulldogs]]
* [[Arizona Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]]
* [[Chicago Tigers]]
* [[Cleveland Tigers]]
* [[Columbus Panhandles]]
* [[Dayton Triangles]]
* [[Chicago Bears|Decatur Staleys]]
* [[Detroit (NFL)|Detroit Heralds]]
* [[Hammond Pros]]
* [[Muncie Flyers]]
* [[Rochester Jeffersons]]
* [[Rock Island Independents]]


In [[1921]], the APFA began releasing official standings, and the following year, the group changed its name to the [[National Football League]] (NFL). However, the NFL was hardly a major league in the 1920s. Teams entered and left the league frequently. Franchises included the [[Oorang Indians]], an all-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] outfit that also put on a performing dog show.

Former college stars like [[Red Grange]] and [[Benny Friedman]] increasingly joined professional teams, and the pro game slowly began to increase in popularity. By [[1934]], all of the small-town teams, with the exception of the [[Green Bay Packers]], had moved to or been replaced by big cities.

In the [[1932 NFL season|1932 season]], the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[Detroit Lions|Portsmouth Spartans]] tied with the best regular-season records. To determine the champion, the league voted to hold their first [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|playoff game]]. Because of very cold weather, the game was held indoors at [[Chicago Stadium]], which forced some temporary rule changes. Chicago won, 9-0. The playoff proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the [[1933 NFL season|1933 season]], with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game. A number of new rule changes were also instituted: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, every play started from between the hash marks, and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the [[line of scrimmage]] (instead of the previous five yards behind).7

== The NFL gaines popularity (1945&ndash;1959) ==
By the end of [[World War II]], in [[1945]], pro football had begun to rival the college game for fans' attention. The spread of the [[T formation]] led to a faster-paced, higher-scoring game that attracted record numbers of fans. In [[1945]], the [[Cleveland Rams]] moved to [[Los Angeles]], becoming the first big-league sports franchise on the West Coast. In [[1950]], the NFL accepted three teams from the defunct [[All-America Football Conference]], expanding to 13 clubs.

In the [[1950s]], pro football finally earned its place as a major sport. The NFL embraced television, giving Americans nationwide a chance to follow stars like [[Bobby Layne]], [[Paul Hornung]] and [[Johnny Unitas]]. The [[1958]] NFL championship in [[New York City|New York]] — considered by many to be the most-important game in the rise of the NFL — drew record TV viewership and made national celebrities out of Unitas and his [[Baltimore Colts]] teammates.

== NFL supremacy, 1960&ndash;''present''==
The rise of pro football was so fast that by the mid-[[1960s|60s]], it had surpassed [[baseball]] as Americans' favorite spectator sport in some surveys. As more people wanted to cash in on this surge of popularity than the NFL could accommodate, a rival league, the [[American Football League]], was founded in [[1960]]. The costly war for players which ensued, between the NFL and AFL, almost derailed the sport's ascent. In [[1966]], the leagues agreed to merge, with effect from the [[1970]] season. The 10 AFL teams joined three existing NFL teams to form the NFL's [[American Football Conference]]. The remaining 13 NFL teams became the [[National Football Conference]].

In the [[1970s]] and [[1980s|80s]], the NFL solidified its dominance as America's top spectator sport and its important role in American culture. The Super Bowl became an unofficial national holiday and the top-rated TV program most years. [[Monday Night Football]], which first aired in [[1970]] brought in high ratings by mixing sports and entertainment. Rules changes in the late 70s ensured a fast-paced game with lots of passing to attract the casual fan.

The founding of the [[United States Football League]] in the early 80s was the biggest challenge to the NFL in the post-merger era. The USFL was a well-financed competitor with big-name players and a national television contract. However, the USFL failed to make money and folded after three years.

==American football spreads to other countries ==
===Amateur leagues ===
The [[Japan American Football Association]] was founded in [[1934]] with three collegiate teams: [[Rikkyo University|Rikkyo]], [[Meiji University|Meiji]] and [[Waseda University|Waseda]].[http://www.american-football-japan.com/footballjapan-history-eng.htm] By 1937, an allstar game involving teams representing eastern and western Japan, attracted over 25,000 spectators.

American football became popular in various countries after [[World War II]], especially those in which there were large numbers of U.S. military personnel, who often formed a substantial proportion of the players and spectators.

In Japan, high school teams also began to appear. In the 1970s, the movement of players between Japan and the U.S. increased dramatically, along with greater exposure on Japanese television.

The first amateur clubs in Europe were formed in [[West Germany]] in the 1970s. The [[German Football League]]'s first [[German Bowl]] was played in 1979, with Frankfurt winning. In Europe the use of experienced players from the USA or Canada, who had to wear a large "A" on their helmets, brought quick success, but hampered the development of local talent. No more than two or three "A" players were allowed on the field, and in countries like [[Finland]], teams also had to provide a local quarterback. This helped the [[Finnish American Football Association]] win the European championships in the 1980s, over [[Great Britain]] and Germany, where US players often ran the offense in club games, but were not available for the national teams. However they could play for clubs that competed for the [[Euro Bowl]]. (See also: [[List of leagues of American football]]).

===American Pro football outside the U.S.A. ===
Since 1986, the NFL has expanded into new markets and ventures with the [[American Bowl]] games, starting in London. In [[1991]], the league formed the [[World League of American Football]]. This turned into [[NFL Europe]], a developmental league which now has five teams in [[Germany]] and one in the [[Netherlands]]. Franchises which started in other parts of Europe have moved to Germany over the years.

The NFL played a regular-season game in [[Mexico City]] in [[2005]] and for the first time, a regular season game will be played outside North America in 2007 when the Miami Dolphins play the New York Giants at Wembley Stadium in the UK. In [[2003]], The NFL lauched its own television channel on cable and satellite television. It was named the [[NFL Network]].
