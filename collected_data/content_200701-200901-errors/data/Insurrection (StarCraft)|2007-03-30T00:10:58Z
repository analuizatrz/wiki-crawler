'''''StarCraft: Insurrection''''' is a supplement for the [[computer game]] ''[[StarCraft]]'' released on [[July 31]], [[1998]]. Although produced by [[Aztech New Media]], it is a product authorized by [[Blizzard Entertainment]], the original [[game developer|developers of the game]].

The plot revolves around a little-known planet called [[Brontes IV]], where a routine patrol fails to check in. It features three new, full campaigns, which comprise roughly 30 Campaign missions, and more than 100 new multiplayer maps.

The expansion pack does not require ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]'', and the missions can be accessed in the same manner as any fan missions, via the Custom Game screen, and selecting the first mission of the desired campaign.
