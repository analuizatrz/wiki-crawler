The '''Sinixt''' (also known as the [["Arrow Lakes Band"]] or simply as "The Lakes") are a [[First Nation]]s People who today primarily live on the [[Colville Indian Reservation|Colville Reserve]] in [[Washington]] State.  A few Sinixt live in adjacent traditional territory in the [[West Kootenay]] region of [[British Columbia]], particularly the [[Slocan Valley]].  The majority of their traditional territory is in the West [[Kootenay]] region of British Columbia.  The Sinixt are of [[Salishan language|Salishan linguistic extraction]], and their own dialect was similar to [[Colville language|Colville]] and [[Okanagan language|Okanagan]] variations. In prehistoric times, the Sinixt were a semi-sedentary people, living in warm, [[pit-house|semi-subterranean house]]s for the winter months.  The summers were spent managing fishing, hunting, and other food resources in their mountain and lake-dominated homeland.  Scholars have classified the Sinixt as [["complex collectors"]] (as opposed to, e.g., [["hunter-gatherers"]]).

==History==

The history of the Sinixt is long and complex.  They currently are not recognized by the [[Government of Canada]], and were officially declared [["extinct"]] by that country in the 1950s by the [[Indian Act]].  However, there were several hundred Sinixt still living in Washington State at the time, along with other self-identifying Sinixt who had relocated with relatives to the [[Okanagan]].  Today, the Sinixt are taking steps to reclaim their rights in [[British Columbia]], where the vast majority of their ancestral territory lies.  Traditional Sinixt territory was centred in the [[Slocan Valley]] and the Lower [[Arrow Lakes]], and also included the lower [[Kootenay River]], and the [[Columbia River]] from the "Big Bend" north of Revelstoke to just above (and often including) [[Kettle Falls]] in the south.  

===Late Precontact Smallpox/Instability===

There is historic evidence suggesting that the Sinixt were heavily depopulated by one or two [[smallpox]] epidemics that preceded the arrival of [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Metis]] [[fur trade|fur-trader]]s of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].  The epidemic of 1781 was likely the biggest single outbreak, with accounts of that epidemic describing a mortality rate up to 80%.  [[David Thompson (explorer, early American settler)|David Thompson]] and other early traders noticed the pock-marked faces of older Sinixt and heard oral accounts of the epidemic.  There is also evidence that the Sinixt were seriously affected by the major political upheavals that preceded the arrival of the Europeans.  The [[Ktunaxa]] (Kutenai) people who neighboured the Sinixt to the east were driven further into the mountains by the [[Blackfoot]], who had obtained control of Ktunaxa territory in the foothills and northwestern plains.  There is ethnographic evidence suggesting the Ktunaxa and the Sinixt battled each other over the territory along the lower Kootenay River between the present cities of [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]] and [[Castlegar, British Columbia]].  The Ktunaxa were considered the intruders, and the dispute was reportedly ended after the Sinixt mounted a large-scale raid into (Lower) Ktunaxa Territory at the South end of Kootenay Lake.  The Sinixt later renewed their historic peace with the Ktunaxa, and took common cause with them, the [[Kalispel]], the [[Flathead]], the [[# Coeur D'Alene Tribe|Coeur d'Alene]], the [[Spokane (tribe)|Spokane]], the [[Nez Perce]], and others against the [[Blackfoot]].  While the Sinixt never directly fought the Blackfoot as a group, it is very likely that individual Sinixt joined their Salishan neighbours (and the Ktunaxa) in war parties and buffalo hunts to the Western Plains.

===Fur Trade and Border Dispute===

The Sinixt played a major but largely unheralded role in the fur trade, and also in the international dispute between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States of America|USA]] over the what the US called the [[Oregon Country]], which was known to the British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] as the [[Columbia District]].  The Sinixt and their allies had a very close relationship with the Hudson's Bay Company, and it was to be closer to the major trading post at [[Colville]] that led the Sinixt to winter near there for the first time in 1830-31.  Indeed, Fort Colville was created to replace Spokane House, specifically to be closer to the Sinixt.  The Sinixt supported the company in its efforts to prevent American trappers and settlers from entering and taking over the territory<!--in many areas, this was by furthering the creation of a "fur desert", by deliberately depleting fur resources; was this the case in Sinixt turf, or was it physical resistance in this case?-->.  As fur traders, the Sinixt were among the most prolific of all the First Nations who traded at [[Fort Colville]].

===One Nation, Two Countries===

When the United States gained formal control of the Oregon Country south of the 49th Parallel in 1846, most Sinixt remained in American territory near Kettle Falls, where Fort Colville continued to operate.  Kettle Falls (or just above it) was essentially the Southern boundary of Sinixt Territory, and was shared with the Colville People.  They were always extremely close to the Colville People, and the Sinixt's arrival at the falls during fishing season would be celebrated with a three-day dance.  Another 3 day dance would be celebrated at their departure.

Adjacent Sinixt territory in British Columbia remained in the hands of the Sinixt.  As late as the 1860s, Sinixt leaders still equated British title in their Northern territory as signifying Sinixt sovereignty.  When Fort Shepherd was abandoned by the Hudson's Bay Company, for example, it was left in Sinixt hands.  

A large reserve was eventually created in Washington State that extended all the way to the Canadian Border.  The Colville Reservation was later cut in half, which separated it from Sinixt traditional territory in British Columbia.

===Gold/Silver Rushes===

Prospectors began entering Sinixt territory in British Columbia in the 1850s and 60s.  Nevertheless, the Sinixt managed to maintain effective control over their northern traditional territory through the 1850s, 60s, and 70s, despite some conflict.  While often accommodating White interests, they continued to claim ownership in British Columbia and resisted the American miners, sometimes by force.  The Sinixt blocked all Non-Native access to their Canadian territories on a number of occasions.  Virtually no non-Sinixt entered the Slocan Valley until the late 1880s.

However, their reduced numbers resulted in the Sinixt being unable to control development of the area as it was flooded with miners during a second mineral rush in the 1880s and 90s.  Several boomtowns were erected throughout the West Kootenay Region.  The majority of Sinixt continued to live in Washington State, among the security of their friends and relatives on the Colville reserve.  Nevertheless, a number of Sinixt remained permanently in Canada during the first half of the 20th century.  Many others also returned to their ancestral land in B.C. to hunt and fish during the summer months well into the 20th Century.

===Return to Canada===

A permanent Sinixt presence was reestablished in British Columbia during the late 1980s when a number of Sinixt descendents returned to the Slocan Valley to protest road building affecting an important village site.  A bridge being built at Vallican resulted in a road being placed very near the large pithouse village.  Since then, a permanent Sinixt presence continues in the Slocan Valley, with local members overseeing the repatriation of remains and playing an increasing role in local affairs.

===Archeology===

Recent archaeological work has resulted in findings hinting at a complex social society.  This is in line with historic, ethnographic, and contemporary Sinixt accounts of a socially and economically advanced society.  [[Pithouses]] in the Slocan Valley are among the earliest very large houses of this type, with some having diameters of over 20 metres (66 feet).  The Slocan Narrows site also included some of the most recent very large pithouses.  This and other evidence of a hierarchical and stratified society has lead a leading scholar to state that the Sinixt's society was among the most complex of the entire region.  Unfortunately, major [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] projects along the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and [[Kootenay River|Kootenay]] Rivers have resulted in the flooding of many graveyards and the majority of Sinixt village sites.  And Canadian legal paranoia and lack of political will still prevent Sinixt descendants from receiving their due recognition in Canada.
