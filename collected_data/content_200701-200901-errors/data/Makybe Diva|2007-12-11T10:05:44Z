'''Makybe Diva''' is an Australian [[Horse racing|racehorse]], and the first [[thoroughbred]] to win the prestigious [[Melbourne Cup]] three times: in 2003 and 2004, and again in 2005 when she also won the [[Cox Plate]].<ref name="smh" /> [[Father|Sired]] by [[Desert King]] to dam [[Tugela (horse)|Tugela]], Makybe Diva is the highest stakes-earner in Australasian horse-racing history, with winnings of [[Australian dollar|AU$]]14,526,685 when she retired on [[1 November]] [[2005]]. 

"The Diva" is one of only five horses to have won the Cup more than once in the 145 year history of the event. The others are [[Archer (horse)|Archer]] in 1861 and 1862, [[Peter Pan III|Peter Pan]] in 1932 and 1934, [[Rain Lover]] in 1968 and 1969 and [[Think Big (horse)|Think Big]] in 1974 and 1975. 

Makybe Diva is owned by [[South Australian]] tuna fisherman [[Tony Santic]], who named her after the first two letters in five of his employees' names (Maureen, Kylie, Belinda, Diane and Vanessa). The nature of her performances is emphasised by the fact that she is the only mare among the list of multiple winners, and is among only 11 [[mare (horse)|mare]]s, and three [[filly|fillies]] to have won the cup in its history. 

==Prior to racing==

The Makybe Diva story began in 1998 in England. Tony Santic's bloodstock agent John Foote purchased Tugela in foal to Desert King for 60,000 [[guineas]] at the December 1998 Tattersall's Sale. As normally happens with Santic's British-purchased horses, she was taken to Dick Fowlston's Britton House Stud in [[Somerset]] to board before being sent on to Australia.  Tugela gave birth to a bay filly weighing {{kg to lb|55|wiki=yes}} at five minutes past midnight on [[21 March]] [[1999]].  The filly was offered for sale at the December 2000 Tattersall's sales but did not make the reserve. Called Makybe Diva, the filly remained at Britton House Stud until [[August]] of [[2000]], when she and Tugela were shipped to Australia. 

==Season 2002-2003==

Originally trained by [[David Hall (horse trainer)|David Hall]], Makybe Diva made her racetrack debut in [[July]] of [[2002]] as a three-year-old in a [[Maiden race horse|maiden]] race at [[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and finished fourth. At her next start in August, as a four-year-old, Makybe Diva won her maiden race before moving through the classes, winning two events in a row. She had her first metropolitan start when winning a [[fillies]] and [[Mare (horse)|mares]] [[Handicapping#Horse racing|handicap]] over {{m to ft|2000|wiki=yes}} at [[Flemington Racecourse|Flemington]]. She followed with wins over the fields in the Listed [[Werribee]] Cup and [[Group races|Group]] 2 [[Queen Elizabeth Stakes|VRC Queen Elizabeth Stakes]]. Makybe Diva returned briefly in the autumn for two showings over short distance races. But owner Tony Santic and trainer David Hall had other plans in mind for the spring.

==Season 2003-2004 (Melbourne Cup 1) ==

Makybe Diva resumed racing in the spring over {{m to ft|1400}}, but while being reasonably competitive, she did not win any major races. Second up at her next start in the Group 3 [[Stock Stakes]] she came from behind to finish fourth, beaten by just over two lengths. She then started 5-1 [[equal favourite]] in the Group 2 [[Turnbull Stakes]], where she again began in the back of the field, before finishing fourth, beaten by only one length.

After finishing as a 14-1 outsider in the [[Caulfield Cup]], she began her partnership with Sydney jockey [[Glen Boss]]. Coming from near last with {{m to ft|800}} to go in the {{m to ft|2400}} race, she finished fourth behind the Lee Freedman trained Mummify. The first Tuesday in [[November]] [[2003]] was her first Melbourne Cup victory.<ref name="smh" /> Starting as an $8 second favourite, Makybe Diva raced at the back of the field until the finishing straight, where jockey Boss picked his way through the field to win by one and a half lengths.

In the autumn of 2003, she resumed over {{m to ft|1400}} with {{convert|59.5|kg|lk=on}}, followed by a third place finish in the Group 3 Carlyon Cup. Following this, she was blocked when making a winning run in the [[Australian Cup]] before being taken to Sydney, where she placed third in the [[Ranvet Stakes]] and [[The BMW Stakes]], both Group 1 races.  The Group 1 [[Sydney Cup]] over {{m to ft|3200}} was to be her final run for the campaign. Sent out as a $3.50 second favourite, she began off the pace, but charged home to record a win by half a length, becoming the first mare to ever win the [[Sydney Cup]] / [[Melbourne Cup]] double in the same season, and only the fourth horse to have accomplished the double win. 

After the 2003-2004 season, trainer David Hall left to train in [[Hong Kong]], and Makybe Diva was transferred to trainer [[Lee Freedman]], generally regarded as one of Australia's top trainers.<ref name="smh" />

==Season 2004-2005 (Melbourne Cup 2)==

Her campaign in the spring of [[2004]], was aimed at winning the Melbourne Cup for a second time. It followed the pattern of her previous cup winning campaign, even though she appeared to be racing better than before. A close second in the Group 2 [[John F Feehan Stakes]] over {{m to ft|1600}} at Moonee Valley, showed her competitiveness in shorter races. Drawing barrier 18, Makybe Diva was initially at the back of the field, but charged home to be narrowly defeated by the horse that led all the way to win [[Elvstroem]].

Makybe Diva was sent out a $3.60 favourite, and won the 2004 Melbourne Cup.<ref name="smh" /><ref name="smh2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/horseracing/the-race-that-started-a-nation-partying/2005/11/01/1130823208509.html?from=moreStories|title=The race that started a nation partying|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 20|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|year=2005|author=Daniel Ziffer|language=English}}</ref><ref name="smh3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/horseracing/sydney-racegoers-sip-to-champions-success/2005/11/01/1130823208518.html?from=moreStories|title=Sydney racegoers sip to champion's success|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 20|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|year=2005|author=Andrew Clark|language=English}}</ref> In driving rain, the mare defeated a field featuring multiple Irish St. Leger winner [[Vinnie Roe]], Caulfield Cup winners Mummify and [[Elvstroem]], [[Mamool]] from the [[Godolphin stables|Godolphin]] stable, as well as the 2002 Melbourne Cup winner [[Media Puzzle]]. 

Resuming racing in February, Makybe Diva put in close finishes behind Elvstroem in both the [[C F Orr Stakes]] and [[St George Stakes]], at Caulfield. On [[March 12]], she won the [[Australian Cup]], a [[weight for age]] event over {{m to ft|2000}}, and in the process broke the Australian record and setting an unofficial world record for {{m to ft|2000}} on turf. She proceeded to win Sydney's most important WFA race, The BMW Stakes, with a last-to-first burst. In April and May, she raced in Japan, where she failed in two starts, the latter of which was over {{m to ft|3200}} in the Group One Tenno Sho (Emperor's Cup).

Makybe Diva was named [[Australian Champion Racehorse of the Year]] for the 2004/05 season. Along with this she was also named [[Australian Champion Stayer]] and [[Australian Champion Filly and Mare]].

A three quarter brother to Makybe Diva, by [[Redoute's Choice]], was sold in April 2005 for an Australian record price of $2.5 million.  Subsequently named Musket, the colt won his debut at [[Canterbury Park Racecourse|Canterbury]] in August 2006.

==Season 2005-2006 (Melbourne Cup 3)==
{{POV|date=December 2007}}
Resuming racing in August 2005, Makybe Diva won the Group 2 [[Memsie Stakes]] first up, before being beaten by a nose in the [[Dato Tan Chin Nam]] Stakes at Moonee Valley. Two weeks later, with a run down the outside of the field Makybe Diva scored a good win in the Turnbull Stakes over 2000 m at Flemington. The mare further enhanced her reputation despite being eight horses wide on the home turn, with a comfortable victory in the 2005 Cox Plate subsequently beating 2006 winner Fields Of Omagh. 

On [[1 November]] [[2005]], Makybe Diva defied the odds by creating history in winning a record third Melbourne Cup.<ref name="smh" /> Immediately after the race, trainer Lee Freedman said of the achievement: "Go find the smallest child on this course, and there will be the only example of a person who will live long enough to see that again." During the presentation of the Melbourne Cup, owner Tony Santic announced that Makybe Diva would "retire from racing as of today".<ref name="smh" /> 

Makybe Diva carried 58 kg during the record third Melbourne Cup, 2.5 kg above the standard weight-for-age scale. The last horse to carry more than weight-for-age and win was Rain Lover, who was 2 kg over when he won his second cup in [[1969]], with 60.5 kg. Makybe Diva, who broke her own weight-carrying record for a mare of 55.5 kg, which she set in 2004, was the highest-weighted winner of the cup since Think Big won his second Melbourne Cup with 58.5 kg in 1975.

At the end of the 2005 - 2006 season Makybe Diva was named [[Australian Champion Racehorse of the Year]] for the second time, becoming just the third horse to win that accolade more than once.  She was also named [[Australian Champion Stayer]], winning this award for the third consecutive year as well as [[Australian Champion Middle Distance Racehorse]].

==After Racing==

On [[4 July]] [[2006]], Makybe Diva was inducted into the [[Australian Racing Hall of Fame]]

It was announced on 5th August 2006, that Makybe Diva would be honoured at Flemington Racecourse with a bronze statue, in recognition of her historic 3 Melbourne Cup wins.

Makybe Diva headed the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities  ratings for the 2005 - 2006 official end of season assessment.  She was given a rating of 124, ahead of [[Electrocutionist]], [[David Junior]] and [[Heart's Cry]] on 123.  

On 10th of August 2006, it was announced that Makybe Diva would be served by [[Epsom Derby]] winner [[Galileo (horse)|Galileo]] at Coolmore Stud.

At 3.16am on the morning of the 17th of August 2007, AEST time, Makybe Diva gave birth to her first foal, at Coolmore Stud in the Hunter Valley of NSW. Coolmore's Peter O'Brien, said the bay colt "...is a lovely colt with a white face and two white feet," and that "both mother and son were doing very well."<ref>{{Citation  | last =Schlink  | first =Leo |  title =Three-times Melbourne Cup winner Makybe Diva a mum  | newspaper =News.co.au  || date= August 17 2007  | url =http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22260343-2,00.html }}</ref>

Makybe Diva was due to be served by [[Encosta De Lago]] in the spring of 2007 until the outbreak of equine influenza forced the stud to be quarantined. Owner [[Tony Santic]] sent the Diva to American champion [[Fusaichi Pegasus]] instead.
