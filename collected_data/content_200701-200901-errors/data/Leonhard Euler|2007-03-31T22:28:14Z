'''Leonhard Euler''' (pronounced ''Oiler''; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[ˈɔʏlɐ]}}) ([[April 15]], [[1707]] &ndash; [[September 7]], [[1783]]) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]], who spent most of his life in [[Russia]] and [[Germany]].

Euler made important discoveries in fields as diverse as [[calculus]],  and [[topology]]. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for [[mathematical analysis]], such as the notion of a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]].<ref name="function">{{cite book| last = Dunham| first = William| title = Euler: The Master of Us All| year = 1999| publisher =The Mathematical Association of America | pages = 17}}</ref> He is also renowned for his work in [[mechanics]], [[optics]], and [[astronomy]]. 

Euler is considered to be the preeminent mathematician of the 18th century and one of the greatest of all time. He is also one of the most prolific; his collected works fill 60–80 [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|quarto]] volumes.<ref name="volumes"/> A statement attributed to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] expresses Euler's influence on mathematics: "Read Euler, read Euler, he is a master for us all".<ref name="Laplace">{{cite book| last = Dunham| first = William| title = Euler: The Master of Us All| year = 1999 | publisher =The Mathematical Association of America | pages = xiii | quote=Lisez Euler, lisez Euler, c'est notre maître à tous.}}</ref>

Euler was  featured on the sixth series of the Swiss 10-[[Swiss franc|franc]] banknote<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snb.ch/e/banknoten/alle_serien/details/content_6_10_v.html |title=Swiss National Bank Website}}</ref> and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian [[postage stamp]]s. The [[asteroid]] [[2002 Euler]] was named in his honor. He is also commemorated by the [[Lutheran Church]] on their [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] on May 24.

===Childhood===
[[Image:Euler-10 Swiss Franc banknote (front).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Swiss 10 Franc banknote honoring Euler, the most successful Swiss mathematician in history.]] 
Euler was born in [[Basel, Switzerland|Basel]] to Paul Euler, a [[pastor]] of the [[Reformed Church]], '''and''' Marguerite Brucker, a pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters named Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena. Soon after the birth of Leonhard the Eulers moved from [[Basel]] to the town of [[Riehen]], where Euler spent most of his childhood. Paul Euler was a family friend of the [[Bernoulli]]s, and [[Johann Bernoulli]], who was then regarded as Europe's foremost mathematician, would eventually be an important influence on the young Leonhard. His early formal education started in Basel, where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother. At the age of thirteen he matriculated at the [[University of Basel]], and in 1723, received a masters<!--is this a misspelling or is this the accurate name for this degree in this place in this time period?--> of [[philosophy]] degree with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of [[Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. At this time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics.<ref name="childhood">{{cite book |last= James |first= Ioan |title= Remarkable Mathematicians: From Euler to von Neumann |publisher= Cambridge |date= 2002|pages=2 |id= ISBN 0-521-52094-0}}</ref>

Euler was at this point studying [[theology]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at his father's urging, in order to become a pastor. [[Johann Bernoulli]] intervened, and convinced Paul Euler that Leonhard was destined to become a great [[mathematician]]. In 1726, Euler completed his Ph.D. dissertation on the [[Speed of sound|propagation of sound]] with the title ''De Sono''<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/euler/e002tr.pdf Translation of Euler's Ph.D in English by Ian Bruce]}}</ref> and in 1727, he entered the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy Prize Problem]]'' competition, where the problem that year was to find the best way to place the [[mast]]s on a [[ship]]. He won second place, losing only to [[Pierre Bouguer]]&mdash;a man now known as "the father of naval architecture". Euler, however, would eventually win the coveted annual prize twelve times in his career.<ref name="prize">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727-1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 156}}</ref>

===St. Petersburg===
Around this time Johann Bernoulli's two sons, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel]] and [[Nicolaus II Bernoulli|Nicolas]] were working at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[St Petersburg]]. In July 1726, Nicolas died of [[appendicitis]] after spending a year in Russia, and when Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division he recommended that the post in physiology that he vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to St Petersburg. In the interim he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.<ref name="stpetersburg">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727-1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 125}}</ref>

[[Image:Euler-USSR-1957-stamp.jpg|thumb|300px|1957 stamp of the former [[Soviet Union]] commemorating the 250th birthday of Euler. The Text says: 250 Years from the birth of the great Mathematician and Academic, Leonhard Euler.]]
Euler arrived in the Russian capital on [[May 17]], [[1727]]. He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he often worked in close collaboration. Euler mastered [[Russian language|Russian]] and settled into life in St Petersburg. He also took on an additional job as a medic in the [[Russian Navy]].<ref name="medic">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727-1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 127}}</ref>

The Academy at St. Petersburg, established by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler: the academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility. Very few students were enrolled in the academy so as to lessen the faculty's teaching burden, and the academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time and the freedom to pursue scientific questions.<ref name="prize">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727-1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 124}}</ref> 

However, the Academy's benefactress, [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]], who had attempted to continue the progressive policies of her late husband, died shortly before Euler's arrival. The Russian nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. The nobility were suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, and thus cut funding and caused numerous other difficulties for Euler and his colleagues.

Conditions improved slightly upon the death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at St. Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department.<ref name="promotion">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727-1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 128-129}}</ref> 

On [[January 7]], [[1734]], he married Katharina Gsell, daughter of a painter from the Academy Gymnasium. The young couple bought a house by the [[Neva River]], and had thirteen children, of whom only five survived childhood.<ref name="wife">{{cite web| url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Euler_Fuss_Eulogy.html| title = Eulogy of Euler by Fuss| accessmonthday =August 30| accessyear =2006| last = Fuss| first = Nicolas}}</ref>

===Berlin===
[[Image:Euler GDR stamp.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Stamp of the former [[German Democratic Republic]] honoring Euler on the 200th anniversary of his death. In the middle, it is showing his polyhedral formula.]]

Concerned about continuing turmoil in Russia, Euler debated whether to stay in St. Petersburg or not.  [[Frederick the Great of Prussia]] offered him a post at the ''[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]]'', which he accepted. He left St. Petersburg on [[June 19]], [[1741]] and lived twenty-five years in [[Berlin]], where he wrote over 380 articles. In Berlin, he published the two works which he would be most renowned for: the ''Introductio in analysin infinitorum'', a text on functions published in 1748 and the ''[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E212.html Institutiones calculi differentialis]'', a work on [[differential calculus]].<ref name="Friedrich">{{cite book| last = Dunham| first = William | title = Euler: The Master of Us All | year = 1999| publisher =The Mathematical Association of America | pages = xxiv-xxv }}</ref>

In addition, Euler was asked to tutor the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau, Frederick's niece. He wrote over 200 letters to her, which were later compiled into a best-selling volume, titled the ''Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess''. This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering valuable insight on Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book ended up being more widely read than any of his mathematical works, and was published all across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of the ''Letters'' testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.<ref name="Friedrich"/>

Despite Euler's immense contribution to the Academy's prestige, he was eventually forced to leave Berlin. This was caused in part by a personality conflict with Frederick. Frederick came to regard him as unsophisticated especially in comparison to the circle of philosophers the German king brought to the Academy. [[Voltaire]] was among those in Frederick's employ, and the Frenchman enjoyed a favored position in the king's social circle. Euler, a simple religious man and a hard worker, was very conventional in his beliefs and tastes. He was in many ways the direct opposite of Voltaire. Euler had very limited training in [[rhetoric]] and tended to debate matters that he knew little about, making him a frequent target of Voltaire's wit.<ref name="Friedrich"/> [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick]] also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities: <blockquote>I wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir, from where it should fall back through channels, finally spurting out in [[Sanssouci]]. My mill was carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir. Vanity of vanities! Vanity of geometry!<ref>{{cite book | title=Letters of Voltaire and Frederick the Great, Letter H 7434, 25 January 1778 | author=[[Frederick II of Prussia]] | translator=[[Richard Aldington]] | publisher=Brentano's | location=New York | date=1927 }}</ref></blockquote>

===Eyesight deterioration===
[[Image:Leonhard Euler.jpg|thumb|A 1753 portrait by [[Emanuel Handmann]]. This portrayal suggests problems of the right eyelid and that Euler is perhaps suffering from [[strabismus]]. The left eye appears healthy, as it was a later cataract that destroyed it.<ref name="blind> {{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727-1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 154-155}}</ref>]]

Euler's eyesight worsened throughout his mathematical career. Three years after suffering a  near-fatal fever in 1735 he became nearly blind in his right eye, but Euler rather blamed his condition on the painstaking work on [[cartography]] he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy. Euler's sight in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, so much so that Frederick referred to him as "[[Cyclops]]". Euler later suffered a [[cataract]] in his good left eye, rendering him almost totally blind a few weeks after its discovery. Even so, his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity, as he compensated for it with his mental calculation skills and photographic memory. For example, Euler could repeat the [[Aeneid]] of [[Virgil]] from beginning to end without hesitation, and for every page in the edition he could indicate which line was the first and which the last.<ref name="volumes">{{cite journal|last = Finkel|first = B.F.|year = 1897|title = Biography- Leonard Euler|journal = The American Mathematical Monthly| volume = 4| issue = 12| pages = 300}}</ref>

===Return to Russia===
[[Image:Euler Grave at Alexander Nevsky Monastry.jpg|thumb|left|Euler's grave at the [[Alexander Nevsky Laura]].]]
The situation in Russia had improved greatly since the ascension of [[Catherine the Great]], and in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy and spent the rest of his life in Russia. His second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A 1771 fire in St. Petersburg cost him his home and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife of 40 years. Euler would eventually remarry three years later. 

On [[September 7]], [[1783]], Euler passed away in St. Petersburg after suffering a [[brain hemorrhage]] and was buried in the [[Alexander Nevsky Laura]].  His eulogy was written for the French Academy by the French mathematician and philosopher [[Marquis de Condorcet]], and an account of his life, with a list of his works, by Nikolaus von Fuss, Euler's son-in-law and the secretary of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg]]. [[Condorcet]] commented,
:: '' "...il cessa de calculer et de vivre," '' (he ceased to calculate and to live).<ref name=condorcet>{{cite web| url = http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/historica/condorcet.html| title = Eulogy of Euler - Condorcet| accessmonthday =August 30| accessyear =2006| author =Marquis de Condorcet}}</ref>

==Contributions to mathematics==
{{Main|Contributions of Leonhard Euler to mathematics}}
Euler worked in almost all areas of mathematics: [[geometry]], [[calculus]], [[trigonometry]], [[algebra]], and [[number theory]], not to mention continuum physics, lunar theory and other areas of physics. His importance in the history of mathematics cannot be overstated: if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 [[Book size|quarto]] volumes<ref name="volumes"/> and Euler's name is associated with an [[List of topics named after Leonhard Euler|impressive number of topics]]. The 20th century Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] is perhaps the only other mathematician who could be considered to be as prolific.

===Mathematical notation===
Euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a [[function (mathematics)|function]]<ref name="function"/> and was the first to write ''f''(''x'') to denote the function ''f'' applied to the argument ''x''. He also introduced the modern notation for the [[trigonometric functions]], the letter ''e'' for the base of the [[natural logarithm]] (now also known as [[Euler's number]]), the Greek letter <math>\Sigma</math> for summations and the letter ''i'' to denote the [[imaginary unit]].<ref name=Boyer>{{cite book|title = A History of Mathematics|last= Boyer|first=Carl B.|coauthors= Uta C. Merzbach|publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons]]|id= ISBN 0-471-54397-7|pages = 439-445}}</ref> The use of the Greek letter [[pi (letter)|π]] to denote the [[pi|ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter]] was also popularized by Euler, although it did not originate with him.<ref name="pi">{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/talks/mathml/mathml2.html| title = Mathematical Notation: Past and Future| accessmonth = August| accessyear=2006| last = Wolfram| first = Stephen}}</ref>

===Analysis===
The development of [[calculus]] was at the forefront of 18th century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis&mdash;family friends of Euler&mdash;were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus naturally became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs may not have been acceptable under modern standards of [[mathematical rigor|rigour]],<ref name="Basel">{{cite book| last = Wanner| first = Gerhard| coauthors = Harrier, Ernst | title = Analysis by its history| edition = 1st| year = 2005| month = March| publisher = Springer| pages = 62}}</ref> his ideas led to many great advances.

He is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of [[power series]]: that is, the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as

:<math>e = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {1 \over n!} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{0!} + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!}\right)</math>

Notably, Euler discovered the power series expansions for ''e'' and the [[inverse tangent]] function. His daring (and, by modern standards, technically incorrect) use of power series enabled him to solve the famous [[Basel problem]] in 1735:<ref name="Basel">{{cite book| last = Wanner| first = Gerhard| coauthors = Harrier, Ernst | title = Analysis by its history| edition = 1st| year = 2005| month = March| publisher = Springer| pages = 62}}</ref>

:<math>\lim_{n \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^2}\right) = \frac{\pi ^2}{6}</math>

[[Image:Euler's formula.svg|thumb|180px|A geometric interpretation of Euler's formula]]

Euler introduced the use of the [[exponential function]] and [[logarithms]] in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions in terms of power series, and successfully defined logarithms for negative and [[complex number]]s, thus greatly expanding the scope where logarithms could be applied in mathematics.<ref name=Boyer>{{cite book|title = A History of Mathematics|last= Boyer|first=Carl B.|coauthors= Merzbach, Uta C. |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons]]|id= ISBN 0-471-54397-7|pages = 439-445}}</ref> He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers and discovered its relation to the [[trigonometric function]]s. For any [[real number]] φ, [[Euler's formula]] states that the complex exponential function satisfies

:<math>e^{i\phi} = \cos \phi + i\sin \phi \!.</math>

A special case of the above formula is known as [[Euler's identity]],
:<math>e^{i \pi} +1 = 0 \, </math>
called "the most remarkable formula in mathematics" by [[Richard Feynman]], for its single uses of the notions of addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and equality, and the single uses of the important constants 0, 1, ''e'', ''i'', and π.<ref name="Feynman">
{{cite book |last= Feynman|first= Richard|title= The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume I |origyear=1970 |origmonth= June|pages=p.10 |chapter= Chapter 22: Algebra}}</ref>

In addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher [[transcendental function]]s by introducing the [[gamma function]] and introduced a new method for solving [[quartic equation]]s. He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern [[complex analysis]], and invented the [[calculus of variations]] including its most well-known result, the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]. 

Euler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, [[analytic number theory]]. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of [[hypergeometric series]], [[q-series]], [[hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic trigonometric functions]] and the analytic theory of [[generalized continued fraction|continued fractions]]. For example, he proved the [[infinitude of primes]] using the divergence of the harmonic series, and used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way [[prime numbers]] are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the [[prime number theorem]].<ref name="analysis">{{cite book| last = Dunham| first = William| title = Euler: The Master of Us All | year = 1999| publisher =The Mathematical Association of America | chapter = 3,4 }}</ref>

===Number theory===
Euler's great interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy, [[Christian Goldbach]]. A lot of his early work on number theory was based on the works of [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas while disproving some of his more outlandish conjectures. 

One focus of Euler's work was to link the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that [[Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges|the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges]]. In doing so, he discovered the connection between Riemann zeta function and prime numbers, known as the [[Proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function|Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function]].

Euler proved [[Newton's identities]], [[Fermat's little theorem]], [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], and made distinct contributions to [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]]. He also invented the [[totient function]] φ(n) which assigns to a positive integer n the number of positive integers less than n and coprime to n. Using properties of this function he was able to generalize Fermat's little theorem to what would become known as [[Euler's theorem]]. He further  contributed significantly to the understanding of [[perfect numbers]], which had fascinated mathematicians since [[Euclid]]. Euler made progress toward the prime number theorem and conjectured the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]]. The two concepts are regarded as the fundamental theorems of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].<ref name="numbertheory">{{cite book| last = Dunham| first = William| title = Euler: The Master of Us All | year = 1999| publisher =The Mathematical Association of America | chapter = 1,4}}</ref>

===Graph theory===
{{Seealso|Seven Bridges of Königsberg}}
[[Image:Konigsberg_bridges.png|frame|right|Map of Königsberg in Euler's time showing the actual layout of the seven bridges, highlighting the river Pregolya and the bridges.]]
In 1736, Euler solved a problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg.<ref name="bridge">{{cite journal| last = Alexanderson| first = Gerald| year = 2006| month = July| title = Euler and Königsberg's bridges: a historical view| journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society| url = http://www.ams.org/bull/0000-000-00/S0273-0979-06-01130-X/S0273-0979-06-01130-X.pdf}}</ref> The city of [[Kaliningrad|Königsberg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]) is set on the [[Pregolya|Pregel]] River, and included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The question is whether it is possible to walk with a route that crosses each bridge exactly once, and return to the starting point. It is not; and therefore not an [[Eulerian path|Eulerian circuit]]. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of [[graph theory]] and [[planar graph]] theory.<ref name="bridge"/> Euler also introduced the notion now known as the [[Euler characteristic]] of a space and a formula relating the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron with this constant. The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]<ref name="Cauchy">{{cite journal|author=Cauchy, A.L.|year=1813|title=Recherche sur les polyèdres - premier mémoire|journal=Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique|volume= 9 (Cahier 16)|pages=66–86}}</ref> and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huillier|L'Huillier]],<ref name="Lhuillier">{{cite journal|author=L'Huillier, S.-A.-J.|title=Mémoire sur la polyèdrométrie|journal=Annales de Mathématiques|volume=3|year=1861|pages=169–189}}</ref> is at the origin of [[topology]].

===Applied mathematics===
Some of Euler's greatest successes were in using analytic methods to solve real world problems, describing numerous applications of [[Bernoulli numbers|Bernoulli's numbers]], [[Fourier series]], [[Venn diagrams]], [[Euler numbers]], [[E (mathematical constant)|e]] and [[pi|π]] constants, continued fractions and integrals. He integrated [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[differential calculus]] with Newton's method of [[fluxion]]s, and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. He made great strides in improving the [[numerical approximation]] of integrals, inventing what are now known as the [[Euler approximations]]. The most notable of these approximations are [[Euler's method]] and the [[Euler-Maclaurin formula]]. He also facilitated the use of [[differential equations]], in particular introducing the [[Euler-Mascheroni constant]]: 

:<math>\gamma = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } \left( 1+ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} - \ln(n) \right).</math>

One of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in [[music]].  In 1739 he wrote the ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae,'' hoping to eventually integrate [[musical theory]] as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.<ref name="music">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727-1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 144-145}}</ref>

===Physics and astronomy===
Euler helped develop the [[Euler-Bernoulli beam equation]], which became a cornerstone of engineering. Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in [[classical mechanics]], Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized by a number of Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the [[solar parallax|parallax]] of the sun. His calculations also contributed to the development of accurate [[longitude|longitude tables]]<ref> Youschkevitch, A P; Biography in ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'' (New York 1970-1990).</ref>

In addition, Euler made important contributions in [[optics]]. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory of light in the ''[[Opticks]]'', which was then the prevailing theory. His 1740's papers on optics helped ensure that the [[wave theory of light]] proposed by [[Christian Huygens]] would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the [[wave-particle duality|quantum theory of light]].<ref name="optics">{{cite journal | author = Home, R.W.| year = 1988| title = Leonhard Euler's 'Anti-Newtonian' Theory of Light| journal = Annals of Science| volume = 45| issue = 5| pages = 521-533}}
</ref>

===Logic===
He is also credited with using [[closed curve]]s to illustrate [[syllogism|syllogistic]] reasoning (1768). These diagrams have become known as [[Euler diagram]]s.<ref name="logic> Baron, M. E.; A Note on The Historical Development of Logic Diagrams. The Mathematical Gazette: The Journal of the Mathematical Association. Vol LIII, no. 383 May 1969.</ref>

==Philosophy and religious beliefs==
Euler and his friend Daniel Bernoulli were opponents of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz's]] [[Monism|monadism]] and the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. Euler insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide. Euler's religious leanings might also have had a bearing on his dislike of the doctrine; he went so far as to label Wolff's ideas as "heathen and atheistic".<ref name="wolff">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald  | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727-1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 153-154}}</ref>

Much of what is known of Euler's religious beliefs can be deduced from his ''Letters to a German Princess'' and an earlier work,  ''Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister'' (''Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers''). These works present Euler as a staunch [[Christian]] and a [[biblical literalist]] (for example, the ''Rettung'' was primarily an argument for the [[Biblical inspiration|divine inspiration of scripture]]).<ref name="theology">{{cite journal| last = Euler| first = Leonhard | editor = Orell-Fussli| year = 1960| title = Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister| journal = Leonhardi Euleri Opera Omnia (series 3)| volume = 12 }}</ref>

There is a famous anecdote inspired by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg academy. The French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for [[atheism]] were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman. Diderot was later informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the [[existence of God]]: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced, "Sir, <math>\begin{matrix}\frac{a+b^n}{n}=x\end{matrix}</math>, hence God exists—reply!". Diderot, to whom all mathematics was gibberish (or so the story says), stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court. Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request that was graciously granted by the Empress. However amusing the anecdote may be, it is almost certainly false, given that Diderot was actually a capable mathematician.<ref name="diderot">{{cite journal| last = Brown | first = B.H.| year = 1942| month = May| title = The Euler-Diderot Anecdote| journal =The American Mathematical Monthly| volume = 49| issue = 5| pages = 302-303}}</ref>

Euler has an [[Contributions of Leonhard Euler to mathematics#Works|extensive bibliography]] but his best known books include:
*''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04760115 Elements of Algebra]''.  This elementary algebra text starts with a discussion of the nature of numbers and gives a comprehensive introduction to algebra, including formulae for solutions of polynomial equations.
*''Introductio in analysin infinitorum'' (1748). English translation ''Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite'' by John Blanton (Book I, ISBN 0-387-96824-5, Springer-Verlag 1988; Book II, ISBN 0-387-97132-7, Springer-Verlag 1989).
*Two influential textbooks on calculus: ''Institutiones calculi differentialis'' (1755) and ''Institutiones calculi integralis'' (1768–1770).
*''Lettres à une Princesse d'Allemagne'' (Letters to a German Princess) (1768-1772). Available [http://perso.club-internet.fr/nielrowclub-internet.fr/nielrowbooks/euler.tif online] (in French). English translation, with notes, and a life of Euler, available online from [[Google Books]]: [http://books.google.com/books?vid=09-Fi9xi6pUzqBOnQzlnRS&id=hAm5VsEeu1EC&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22Leonhard+Euler%22 Volume 1], [http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC00826569&id=CZLPNtEnFRcC&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22Leonhard+Euler%22 Volume 2]
*''Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas maximi minimive proprietate gaudentes, sive solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti'' (1744). The Latin title translates as ''a method for finding curved lines enjoying properties of maximum or minimum, or solution of isoperimetric problems in the broadest accepted sense''.<ref>[http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E065.html E65 -- Methodus... entry at Euler Archives]</ref>

A definitive collection of Euler's works, entitled ''Opera Omnia,'' has been published since [[1911]] by the [http://www.leonhard-euler.ch/ Euler Commission] of the [[Swiss Academy of Sciences]].
