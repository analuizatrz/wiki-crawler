'''Sunset Crater''' is a [[cinder cone]] located north of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] in [[U.S. State]] of [[Arizona]]. The crater is within the Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument. 

Sunset Crater is the youngest in a string of volcanoes (the [[San Francisco volcanic field]]) that is related to the nearby [[San Francisco Peaks]].<ref name="fs017_01">

It first erupted in 1064, and the last major eruption occurred in 1100, raising the volcano's height to about {{convert|300|m|ft|sigfigs=2}}.  A final burst of activity in the 13th century painted the upper portion of the otherwise black cone with bright red and orange rocks, giving the volcano its name.  The volcano has partially revegetated, with [[pine]]s and [[wildflower]]s. The crater has given its name to the [[Sunset Crater Beardtongue]] (''Penstemon clutei'').

Damage from [[hiking|hikers]] forced the [[United States National Park Service|National Park Service]] to close a trail leading to the crater, but a short trail at the base remains.<ref>

The hiking trail below the summit skirts the substantial Bonito Lava Flow.  This hardened lava is black and appears fresh as it has devastated the forest in its path.  The lava flow also created an ice cave or tube that is now closed to the public after a partial collapse.

'''Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument''' is a [[U.S. National Monument]] in the north-central part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arizona]], intended to protect [[Sunset Crater]], a [[cinder cone]] that is part of the [[San Francisco Volcanic Field]].<ref name="scvnm">

It is maintained by the [[United States National Park Service|National Park Service]] in close conjunction with nearby [[Wupatki National Monument]]. In the late 1920s, a [[Hollywood]] film company attempted to detonate large quantities of explosives inside Sunset Crater in order to simulate a volcanic eruption. Public outcry over this plan led in part to the proclamation of Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument by President [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1930.

A one mile (1.6 km) self-guiding loop trail is located at the base of Sunset Crater but hiking to the summit is not permitted. A trail providing access to the summit and crater was closed in 1974  because of excessive erosion caused by hikers. A visitor center is located near the park entrance, {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} north of [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] along [[U.S. Highway 89]].
