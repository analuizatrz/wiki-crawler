'''Madeira''' ({{pronounced|mɐdeiɾɐ}} or {{IPA|[mɐˈdɐiʀɐ]}}) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[archipelago]] in the north [[Atlantic Ocean]] that lies between {{coor dm|32|22.3|N|16|16.5|W}} and {{coor dm|33|7.8|N|17|16.65|W}}. It is one of the [[Autonomous regions of Portugal]], with '''Madeira Island''' and '''[[Porto Santo]] Island''' being the only inhabited [[islands]]. It belongs politically and culturally to [[Europe]], even if it can be considered to be a geographical part of the [[African Plate]].

Madeira, known originally to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as the ''Purple Islands'', was rediscovered, possibly accidentally, by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailors and settled by [[Portugal]] as early as 1418 or as late as 1420.  The archipelago is considered to be the first discovery of the exploratory period initiated by [[Henry the Navigator]] of Portugal. It is a popular year-round [[resort]], noted for its [[Madeira wine]], flowers, and embroidery artisans, as well as its New Year's Eve celebrations that feature a spectacular [[fireworks show]], which is the largest in the [[world]] according to the [[Guinness World Records]].<ref>http://www.madeiratourism.com/pls/madeira/wsmwdet0.detalhe_conteudo?p_cot_id=960&p_lingua=en&p_sub=1 Madeira “largest firework display in the world”</ref>

==Geography and climate==
The Autonomous Region of Madeira is composed of Madeira Island, [[Porto Santo]] Island, [[Desertas Islands]] and [[Savage Islands]].

[[Funchal]], the capital of Madeira Island, is on the south coast of the principal island, in {{coor dm|32|37.75|N|16|55.3|W}}. Other main cities are: [[Porto Santo]] Town (also known as [[Vila Baleira]]), [[Ribeira Brava, Madeira Islands|Ribeira Brava]], [[Machico]], [[Câmara de Lobos]], [[Santa Cruz, Madeira|Santa Cruz]] and [[Santana, Madeira|Santana]].

The archipelago lies about 360 miles from the coast of Africa, 535 miles from [[Lisbon]], 230 miles from [[Gran Canaria]], and 480 miles from [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], the nearest of the [[Azores]].
[[Image:Madeira island.gif|thumb|left|200px|Map of the islands.]]
Madeira Island is the largest island of the group with an area of 741 km², a length of 30 geographical miles (57 km), a breadth of 13 miles (22 km) at its widest point, and a coastline of 80 to 90 miles. Its longer axis lies east and west, along which lies a mountain chain with a mean altitude of 4000 feet (1220 metres), considered the backbone of the island from which many deep ravines radiate outward to the coast. Its most famous cliff, the [[Cabo Girão]], is one of the biggest in [[Europe]]. The highest point on the island is [[Pico Ruivo]], at 1862 meters (6107 feet)[http://www.madeirahelp.com/madeira_geography].

In the south, there is very little left of the indigenous ''[[laurisilva]]'' subtropical rainforest which once covered the whole island (the original settlers set fire to the island to clear the land for farming) and gave it the name it now bears (''Madeira'' means "wood" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). However, in the north, the valleys contain native trees of fine growth. These ''laurisilva'' forests, notably the forests on the northern slopes of Madeira Island, are designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].

A long, narrow, and comparatively low rocky promontory forms the eastern extremity of the island, on which lies a tract of calcareous sand known as the Fossil Bed. It contains land shells and numerous bodies resembling the roots of trees, probably produced by infiltration.

Madeira Island's geographical position and mountainous landscape result in a very pleasant climate which varies between the north side, south side, and smaller islands groups like Porto Santo and Savages. The mean annual average on the coast line can reach more than 20°C in the south. With its mild humidity, the weather of the island is classified as oceanic subtropical and with its low rain level, desertic on the Savages. Influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]], sea water temperature varies between 26°C during the summer and 17°C in the winter.

==History==
[[Image:Sé church Funchal.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Cathedral]] Sé]]
===Pre-Portuguese times===
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentions certain Purple Islands, the position of which with reference to the Fortunate Islands or [[Canary Islands|Canaries]] might seem to indicate Madeira islands. Plutarch (''Sertorius'', 75 AD) referring to the military commander [[Quintus Sertorius]] (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to [[Cadiz]], "he met seamen recently arrived from Atlantic islands, two in number, divided from one another only by a narrow channel and distant from the coast of Africa 10,000 [[furlong]]s. They are called Isles of the Blest." The estimated distance from Africa, and the closeness of the two islands, seem to indicate Madeira and [[Porto Santo]].

There is a romantic tale about two lovers, [[Robert Machim]] and [[Anna d'Arfet]] in time of the King [[Edward III of England]], fleeing from [[England]] to [[France]] in [[1346]], were driven off their course by a violent storm, and cast on the coast of Madeira at the place subsequently named [[Machico]], in memory of one of them. On the evidence of a [[portolan]] dated [[1351]], preserved at [[Florence, Italy]], it would appear that Madeira had been discovered long before that date by Portuguese vessels under [[Genoa|Genoese]] captains.

===Portuguese discovery===
[[Image:Funchal ( Portugal )13.jpg|thumb|255px|Statue of [[João Gonçalves Zarco]], the first [[Portugal|Portuguese]] to settle in Madeira]]
In 1419 two of the captains of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] and [[Tristão Vaz Teixeira]], were driven by a storm to the island called by them Porto Santo, or Holy Port, in gratitude for their rescue from shipwreck. The next year an expedition was sent to populate the island, and, Madeira being described, they made for it, and took possession on behalf of the Portuguese crown.

The islands started to be settled circa 1420 or 1425. In [[September 23]], [[1433]], the name ''Ilha da Madeira'' (Madeira Island or "island of the [[wood]]") appears in a map, by the first time, in a document.

The three captain-donees had led, in the first trip, the respective families, a small group of people of the minor [[nobility]], people of modest conditions and some old prisoners of the kingdom. To gain the minimum conditions for the development of [[agriculture]], they had to rough-hew a part of the dense forest of [[laurisilva]] and to construct a large number of canals ([[levada]]s), since in some parts of the island, they had water in excess while in other parts water was scarce. In the earliest times, [[fish]] constituted about half of the settlers' diet, together with vegetables and fruit. The first local agricultural activity with some success was the raising of [[wheat]]. Initially, the colonists produced wheat for their own sustenance but, later began to export wheat to Portugal. 

However, in time grain production began to fall. To get past the ensuing crisis [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]] decided to order the planting of [[Sugarcane]] - rare in [[Europe]] and, therefore, considered a [[spice]] - promoting, for this, the introduction of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] beets as the first specialized plant and the technology of its agriculture. Sugarcane production became a leading factor in the island's economy, and increased the demand for labour. Jewish, Genoese and Portuguese traders were attracted to the islands. Sugarcane cultivation and the sugar production industry developed until the [[17th century]]. 

Following the 17th century Madeira's most important product has been its [[wine]], sugar production having since moved on to [[Brazil]], [[São Tomé and Principe]], and elsewhere.  Madeira wine was perhaps the most popular luxury beverage in the colonial Western Hemisphere during the 17th and 18th centuries.  The [[British Empire]] occupied Madeira as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, a friendly occupation which concluded in 1814 when the island was returned to [[Portugal]],and the British did much to popularise Madeira wine. 

In 1921, the last [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] was deported to Madeira, after an unsuccessful [[coup d'état]]. He died there one year later and is buried in [[Monte (Funchal)]].

In [[July 1]] [[1976]], following the [[Carnation revolution|democratic revolution]] of 1974, Portugal granted political autonomy to Madeira. The region has now its own government and legislative assembly.

===History of Portuguese discovery===

*The discoveries of Porto Santo and Madeira were first described by Gomes Eannes de [[Azurara]] in ''Chronica da Descoberta e Conquista da Guiné''. (Eng. version by Edgar Prestage in 2 vols. issued by the Hakluyt Society, London, 1896-1899: ''The Chronicle of Discovery and Conquest of Guinea''.)

* [[Arkan Simaan]] relates in French these discoveries in his novel based on Azurara's Chronicle: ''L’Écuyer d’Henri le Navigateur'', published by Éditions l’Harmattan, Paris.

==Economy==
[[Image:Casino funchal hg.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Madeira's Casino, Funchal]]
[[Image:AIDAblu-Madeira.jpg|thumb|225px|The busy port of Funchal]]
The setting-up of the [[Free Industrial Zone]] has led to the installation, under more favourable conditions, of infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized [[industrial enterprises]]. The Free Zone of Madeira, also called the Madeira International Business Centre, being a tax-privileged economic area, provides an incentive for companies, offering them financial and tax advantages via a whole range of activities exercised in the Industrial Free Zone, the Off-Shore Financial Centre, the International Shipping Register organisation, and the International Service Centre. 

The services sector makes the largest contribution to the formation of the regional gross value added as opposed to the [[agricultural sector]], for which the share has continuously declined in the regional economy.

Over the last few years, the regional economy has managed to open up and establish more internal and external competitiveness, so that its companies have become internationalised.

The largest industries are associated with the activities of food, [[beverages]] (and especially [[Madeira wine]]) and [[construction]].

==Tourism==

[[Tourism]] is an important sector in the region's economy since it contributes 20% to the region's [[GDP]], providing support throughout the year for [[commerce|commercial]], [[transport]] and other activities and constituting a significant market for local products. The share in Gross Value Added of hotels and [[restaurants]] (9%) also highlights this phenomenon. The island of [[Porto Santo]], with its 9 km long beach and its climate, is totally devoted to tourism. Over the past decade it has recorded a substantial increase in its hotel accommodation capacity. 
[[Image:Funchal Pico da Cruz.jpg|350px|thumb|left|[[Funchal]]]]
The Madeira has considerable [[potential]] since the necessary infrastructure has been established and adequate investment incentives introduced for expanding its hotel and catering structure in a controlled manner, without disturbing the socio-economic and environmental balance, and without neglecting the conservation of its nature, which is one of tourists' main reasons for visiting Madeira.

Visitors are from the [[European Union]], with [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Scandinavia]] and  [[Portugal|Portuguese]] tourists providing the main contingents. The average annual occupancy rate was 57.4% in 2001, reaching its maximum in March and April, when it exceeds 70%.
<div style="clear:left;"></div>

==Transport==
[[Image:Flughafen Madeira 1.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Madeira Airport|Madeira International airport]]]]
The Islands have two airports, one in [[Santa Cruz, Madeira|Santa Cruz]] (known as [[Funchal Airport]] (FNC)) on the Island of Madeira and the other in the city of [[Vila Baleira]] on [[Porto Santo Island]]. Flights to the islands are mostly made from [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]], but there are also direct flights from other major European cities and other countries, like [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[South Africa]]. 

In the past Funchal airport was infamous for its runway, which was short and was built on a high embankment but which fell away abruptly to the sea and was often troubled by difficult upwinds which tended to uplift aircraft when landing. In the past the largest airliners that were able to use the airport were the [[Airbus A320]] and [[Boeing 737]], but recently the runway has been realigned and extended to 2.7km, enabling almost any modern airliner to visit the island, including the [[Boeing 747-400]], one of the biggest airliners today. 

[[European Union]] citizens of the [[Schengen Treaty]] area can enter the islands freely, while those from other regions need identification. 

Transport between the two main islands is done by plane or by ferries, the latter also allowing for the transportation of vehicles. Visiting the interior of the islands is now very easy, due to major road developments on the islands during Portugal's economic boom. Modern roads reach all points of interest on the islands, and there is also a good public transportation network.

==Culture and people==
The islands are noted as the source of [[Madeira wine]]. The islands are also known for their exotic flowers, sub-tropical, tropical fruits and New Year's Eve celebrations with a spectacular [[fireworks show]], considered the biggest in the world.

This island now produces also banana, mangoes, papaws, guyabas, pinneapple, sugar cane, avocados, passionflower, coffee and many others. On their gardens also grows coconut palms ( Cocos nucifera), rubber trees and others.

Traditional pastries in Madeira usually contain local ingredients, one of the most common being ''mel de cana'', literally ''sugarcane honey'' - molasses. The traditional cake of Madeira is called 'Bolo de mel', which translates as (Sugarcane) 'Honey Cake' and according to custom is never cut with a knife but broken into pieces by hand. It is a rich and heavy cake. Visitors to the island will see plentiful examples of handicraft on sale in shops.

There are around 250,000 inhabitants (1991) in the two main islands, while only 4,800 live on Porto Santo Island. The population density is 337 inhabitants per square kilometre in Madeira and 112 in Porto Santo. Most of the early settlers were from the Portuguese regions of the [[Algarve]] and [[Minho]]. The islands have historical monuments, streets and plazas (''praças'') with many gardens and typical small towns.

Madeira Island is the top of a massive [[shield volcano]] that rises about 6 km from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.  The volcano formed atop an east-west [[rift]] in the [[oceanic crust]].  Construction of the bulk of the volcano began during the [[Miocene]] Epoch over 5 million years ago and continued into the [[Pleistocene]] until about 700,000 years ago.  This was followed by extensive [[erosion]], producing two large amphitheaters open to south in the central part of the island. 

Volcanic activity later resumed, producing [[scoria cone]]s and [[lava flow]]s atop the older eroded shield.  The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central part of the island only 6,500 years ago, creating more [[cinder cone]]s and lava flows.

==Biodiversity==
[[Image:Madeira-flowers hg.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Typical Madeiran flowers]]
Madeira has three [[endemism in birds|endemic]] birds: [[Zino's Petrel]], the [[Trocaz pigeon]] and the [[Madeira Firecrest]].

It is also of importance for other breeding [[seabird]]s, including the [[Madeiran Storm-petrel]], [[North Atlantic Little Shearwater]] and [[Cory's Shearwater]].

The [[Macaronesia]] region harbours an important floral diversity. In fact, the archipelago's forest composition and maturity are quite similar to the forests found in the [[Tertiary period]] that covered [[Southern Europe]] and [[Northern Africa]] millions of years ago.

The great [[biodiversity]] of Madeira is phytogeographically linked to the [[Mediterranean]] region, [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Australia]], and interest in this phytogeography has been increasing in recent years due to the discovery of some epiphytic bryophyte species with non-adjacent distribution.
Madeira also has many endemic species of fauna–mostly invertebrates but also some vertebrates such as the native bat, some lizards species, and some birds as already mentioned.
These islands have more than 200 species of land molluscs (snails and slugs), some with very unusual shell shape and colours.

==Levadas==
[[Image:Levada.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Levada]]s provide a remarkable network of walking paths on Madeira]]
{{main|Levada}}
The island of Madeira is wet in the northwest but dry in the southeast. In the 16th century the Portuguese started building levadas to carry water to the agricultural regions. The most recent was made in the 1940s. Madeira is very mountainous, and building the levadas was often difficult. Many are cut into the sides of mountains, and it was also necessary to dig 25 miles of tunnels. [1]

Today the levadas not only supply water to the southern parts of the island but provide [[hydro-electric power]]. There are over 1350 miles of levadas and they provide a remarkable network of walking paths. Some provide easy and relaxing walks through beautiful countryside, but others are narrow, crumbling ledges where a slip could result in serious injury or death.

Two of the most popular levadas to hike are the ''Levada do Caldeiro Verde'' and the ''Levada Caldeirão do Inferno'' which should not be attempted by hikers prone to vertigo or without torches and helmets. The ''Levada do Caniçal'' is a much easier walk, running 7.1 miles from [[Maroços]] to the ''Caniçal Tunnel''. It is known as the ''mimosa levada'' because [[Mimosa|mimosa trees]] are found all along the route.

==Sport==
[[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Manchester United]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] footballer, was born in Madeira.<ref>[http://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?section_id=126&id_news=282895 Cristiano Ronaldo]</ref>

Madeira has two football teams in the [[Portuguese Liga|BWINLIGA]], Portugal's top league. [[Marítimo]] of Funchal and [[C.D. Nacional|Nacional]], where [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] played before going to [[Sporting CP|Sporting Lisbon]], are the two biggest and most supported in the island. Marítimo has also nurtured other great players such as [[Pepe]], now at [[Real Madrid]], [[Tonel]], now at [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]] and [[Manduca]], who was transferred to [[Benfica]]. 

Marítimo has also enjoyed various campaigns in the [[UEFA Cup]] having recorded famous results against teams such as [[Juventus]], [[Leeds United|Leeds]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. In [[2003-04 in Portuguese football|2003-04]] Nacional has achieved 4th place, their best classification ever.

In recent years Madeira has had a considerable amount of success in professional [[basketball]], with [[CAB Madeira]] having won numerous titles, especially their female team. CAB are often seen competing in European competition such as the [[FIBA]] [[EuroCup]], and former stars include Filipe da Silva and ex-[[Los Angeles Lakers]] player [[Ike Nwankwo]].

[[Madeira Andebol SAD]], the island's only professional [[handball]] team is one of the most successful in the country, while [[rally car racing]], [[fishing]] and [[golf]] are other popular sports played on the island.

==Postage stamps==
In 1868, Portugal issued [[postage stamp]]s for Madeira, consisting of the current stamps of Portugal [[overprint]]ed "MADEIRA". This continued until 1928, when a series for Madeira was issued; but this was the last to be produced until 1980 (stamps of Portugal having been valid in Madeira since 1898), when Portugal began issuing stamps inscribed "Portugal Madeira" that were valid in both Madeira and Continental Portugal, similar to those issued for the [[Azores]].

==Demographics==
[[Image:Madeira 3d este luisfreitas.png|thumb|220px|A 3D image from the east of the Island.]]
Just like the districts of mainland Portugal, Madeira is also further subdivided into 11 [[município|municipalities]]:

===Capital city===
Today [[Funchal]] is a modern city with about 100,000 inhabitants. [[Funchal]] is located in a unique area; the natural geological features form an "[[amphitheatre]]" surrounding the city, which begins at the harbour and rises almost 1200 metres high on gentle slopes.  This provides a natural shelter and was what attracted the first settlers.

Madeira's [[capital]] for more than five centuries, Funchal is said to have been named as such because of the abundance of [[fennel]] (''funcho'' - in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) that was growing there.

The harbour and [[climate]] combined with an excellent geographical position allowed Funchal to have a rapid population growth.

Probably the most central point is the Sé [[Cathedral]]. Built between [[1493]] and [[1514]] by [[Pêro Annes]] in [[Manueline]] style it represents one of Madeira's numerous treasures.
