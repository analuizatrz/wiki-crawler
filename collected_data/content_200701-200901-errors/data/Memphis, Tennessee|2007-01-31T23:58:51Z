'''Memphis''' is a [[city]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]], [[Tennessee]], of which it is the [[county seat]].
As of 2006, the city of Memphis had an estimated population of 680,768, making it the largest city in the state of [[Tennessee]], the second largest in the southeastern region (only to [[Jacksonville, Florida]]), and the [[List of United States cities by population|17th largest]] in the [[United States]] [http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2006-01.xls]. The greater [[Memphis metropolitan area]] (including the adjacent areas of [[Mississippi]] and [[Arkansas]]) has a population of 1,260,581. This makes Memphis the second largest metropolitan area in Tennessee, surpassed only by metropolitan [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. Even though Memphis is the state's largest city, it is the youngest of Tennessee's four major cities (traditionally including [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] as well as Nashville). Memphis is on the Lower [[Chickasaw Bluff]] above the [[Mississippi River]], at the mouth of the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River]].

== History ==
[[Image:Riverboats at Memphis.jpg|200px|right|thumbnail|Mississippi River landing, Memphis, 1906]]The Memphis area was first settled by the [[Mississippian Culture]] and then by the [[Chickasaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribe]].
European exploration came years later, with [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] believed to have visited what is now the Memphis area as early as the [[1540s]]. By the [[1680s]], French explorers led by [[René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] built [[Fort Prudhomme]] in the vicinity, the first European settlement in what would become Memphis, predating English settlements in [[East Tennessee]] by more than 70 years. [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=F047]

Despite such early outposts, the land comprising present-day Memphis remained in a largely unorganized territory throughout most of the [[18th century]], while the boundaries of what would become Tennessee continued to evolve from its parent — the [[Carolina Colony]], later [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]]. By 1796, the community was the westernmost point of the newly admitted state of Tennessee.[[Image:Union Avenue.jpg|200px|left|thumbnail|Cotton merchants on Union Avenue, Memphis in 1937]]

Memphis was founded in [[1819]] by John Overton, James Winchester, and [[Andrew Jackson]] and was incorporated as a city in [[1826]].  The city was named after the [[Memphis, Egypt|ancient capital]] of [[Egypt]] on the [[Nile River]].  

At the time of the [[American Civil War]], Memphis was already an important regional city because of its river trade and railroad connections. [[Tennessee#History|Tennessee]] seceded from the Union in June 1861 and Memphis briefly became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold.  [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces captured Memphis from Confederacy in the [[Battle of Memphis]] on [[June 6]], [[1862]], and the city remained under Union control for the duration of the war, except for a dramatic [[Second Battle of Memphis|raid]] conducted by [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. Memphis became a Union supply base and continued to prosper throughout the war.

Extensive [[yellow fever]] epidemics in the 1870s (1873, 1878, 1879) devastated the city.  At that time it was not understood that this fatal disease was carried by a mosquito vector, so public health measures were unsuccessful.  So many died or fled the epidemics that in 1879 Memphis lost its city charter and until 1893 was merely a taxing district.  Eventually improvements in sanitation removed the breeding grounds of the mosquito vector and the city  began to grow again. In [[1897]], Memphis' [[pyramid]]-shaped pavilion was a conspicuous part of the [[Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition (1897)|Tennessee Centennial]] exposition. From the [[1910s]] to the [[1950s]], Memphis was a hotbed of [[machine politics]] under the direction of [[E. H. Crump|E. H. "Boss" Crump]].  During the Crump era, Memphis developed an extensive network of parks and public works as part of the national [[City Beautiful Movement]].

[[Image:Jazz drummer.jpg|200px|right|thumbnail|Jazz musician, Memphis, 1939]]During the [[1960s]] the city was at the center of civil rights issues, notably the location of a sanitation workers' strike. Memphis is also known as the place where [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was assassinated on April 4, 1968 at the [[Lorraine Motel]].

Memphis is well known for its cultural contributions to the identity of the American south, including musical and culinary offerings. Many notable blues musicians grew up in and around the Memphis and northern Mississippi, and performed there regularly from the early 1900s onward. These included such musical greats as [[Muddy Waters]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[B.B. King]], and [[Howlin' Wolf]]. The first [[African American]]-formatted radio station, [[WDIA]], was founded in the city in [[1947]] by [[Bert Ferguson]] and [[John Pepper]], and included a young B. B. King as disc jockey. B. B. King's moniker was derived from his WDIA nickname 'Beale Street Blues Boy', a reference to Memphis' [[Beale Street]] on which many nightclubs and blues venues were located.

In addition to a rich musical heritage, Memphis also boasts a long culinary legacy dominated by regional [[barbeque]]. [[Memphis barbeque]] is rendered distinct by its sole usage of pork (as opposed to beef), focus on rib and shoulder cuts of meat, and multiple locally-owned barbeque restaurants. Celebration of this local dish reaches its climax each year in May, when the [[Memphis in May]] Festival holds its annual international [[Memphis in May Barbeque Cookoff]].

== Geography and climate==
[[Image:Memphis front view.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Mud Island [[monorail]] on Front St in downtown Memphis]]
Memphis is located at {{coor dms|35|7|3|N|89|58|16|W|city}} (35.117365, -89.971068){{GR|1}}. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 763.4 [[square kilometre|km²]] (313.8 [[square mile|mi²]]). 723.4 km² (302.3 mi²) of it is land and 40.0 km² (15.4 mi²) of it (5.24%) is water.

===Climate===
Memphis has a mid-latitude temperate climate, with four distinct seasons. The summer months
(late May to late September) are persistently hot (between 68 °F [20 °C] and 95 °F [35 °C]) and humid due to moisture encroaching from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Afternoon
thunderstorms are frequent during some summers, but usually brief, lasting no longer than
an hour. Early Autumn is pleasantly drier and mild, but can remain hot until late October. Abrupt but short-lived cold snaps are common. Late Autumn is rainy and colder, December being the third rainiest month of the year. Fall foliage becomes especially vibrant after the first frost, typically November, and lasts until early December. Winters often
begin abruptly and are characterized by periods of subfreezing (< 32 °F [0 °C]) weather, interspersed with milder spells. Colder subfreezing periods are usually short-lived (2 to 3 days), but have lasted as long as several weeks during more severe winters, though temperatures
typically remain above (10 °F [-12 °C]). The official all-time record low temperature was
-13.0 °F (-25.0 °C), which occurred on [[December 24]], [[1963]]. Mild spells are sometimes warm with temperatures as high as 70 °F (21 °C) during January and February. Snow is rare but does occur annually, with an annual average of 5.7 inches (14.4 cm) at the airport. Spring often begins in late February or early March, following the onset of a sharp warmup. This season is also known as "severe weather season" due to the higher frequency of tornadoes, hail, and thunderstorms producing winds greater than 58 mph (93 km/h). Average rainfall is slightly higher during the spring months (except November) than the rest of the year, but not
to any noticeable extent. Historically, April is the month with the highest frequency of tornadoes, though tornadoes have occurred every month of the year. Memphis is sunny approximately 64% of the time.

===Cityscape===
The city of Memphis is located in southwestern [[Tennessee]] and sits on the eastern bank of the [[Mississippi River]]. It is the regional hub for a [[tri-state area]] of [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]] and Tennessee. [[Interstate 40]] enters the city from the [[Ordinal direction|northeast]], and loops above the central part of the city, exiting across the Mississippi River and travelling to the [[west]]. [[Interstate 55]] approaches the city from the [[south]] and connects with [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], which completes the loop around central Memphis with I-40, and also leaves to the west. [[U.S. Highway 72]] leaves the city traveling to the [[Ordinal directions|southeast]].  The west end of [http://www.geocities.com/usend7079/End078/end078.htm U.S. Highway 78] begins in Memphis, TN on Linden Avenue at the intersection of 2nd Street.  As it leaves Memphis, US 78 follows Lamar Avenue, historically known as ''Pidgeon Roost Road'' for the nestings of [[passenger pigeon]]s formerly in the vicinity.  The east end of U.S. Highway 78 terminates in Charleston, South Carolina.

===Aquifer===
Shelby Country is located over four natural aquifers, one of which is recognized as the "Memphis sand aquifer" or simply as the "Memphis aquifer." This particular water source, located some 350 to 1100 feet underground, is stated to contain "more than 100 trillion gallons of water" by Memphis Light, Gas, and Water,[http://mlgw.com/SubView.php?key=about_ourutilservices] which draws, verifies the cleanliness of, and distributes the water to over 250,000 customers. Furthermore, in the time since the tapping of the well in 1887, the aquifer has only descended 125 feet, suggesting a reliable water source in Memphis for years to come.[http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/pae/environmentalscience/casestudies/case9.mhtml] Most Memphians recognize this as their primary water source, and take great regional pride in their possession of the aquifer.

===Crime===
While in 2004, violent crime in Memphis was at a record low for more than a decade, that trend has changed.  In 2005, Memphis was ranked the 4th most dangerous city, with a population of 500,000 or higher in the U.S.[http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#500,000+]  Crime in Memphis increased in 2005, and has seen a dramatic rise in the first half of 2006.  Nationally, cities follow similar trends, and crime numbers tend to be cyclic.  Local experts and criminologists cite as possible causes to the rise in crime in Memphis to gang recruitment, and to a reduction of federal funding by 66% to the Memphis Police Department.  

In the first half of 2006, robbery of businesses increased 52.5%, robbery of individuals increased 28.5%, and homicide increased 18% over the same period of 2005.[http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/local/article/0,2845,MCA_25340_4880971,00.html]  The Memphis Police Department has responded with the initiation of Operation Blue C.R.U.S.H. (Crime Reduction Using Statistical History), which targets crime hotspots and repeat offenders.[http://www.memphisdailynews.com/Editorial/StoryLead.aspx?id=92313]  Memphis ended 2005 with 154 murders, 2006 ended with 160 murders.

The current [[mayor]] of the city of Memphis is Dr. [[W. W. Herenton]], a formidable and controversial local political figure. Dr. Herenton is currently serving his fourth consecutive term as Mayor. He was elected for the first time in [[1991]], when he became Memphis' first elected [[African American|black]] mayor. (J.O. Patterson, Jr., had previously served as mayor on an interim basis, thus preventing Herenton from actually being the first black mayor.)  Prior to his election, Dr. Herenton served for 12 years as the superintendent of [[Memphis City Schools]].

In recent years, there has been discussion of the potential of a merger of county and city government of Shelby County and City of Memphis into a [[metropolitan government]], similar to that in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

Memphis politics have been racially polarized. Most whites have supported the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] since the 1960s, while most blacks have remained loyal to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].

=== Bridges ===
[[Image:IMG 0095.JPG|right|250px|thumb|The Hernando Desoto Bridge during the day.]]
[[Image:154146pv.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Memphis-Arkansas Memorial Bridge, Frisco Bridge, Harahan Bridge]]
The four bridges that cross the Mississippi River from Memphis are the Hernando De Soto, Harahan, Frisco and the Memphis Arkansas Bridge. All the bridges' piers had to be lined up for river navigation.

The Frisco Bridge (May 12, 1892) was the longest bridge in North America when it opened and was originally called the Great Bridge at Memphis. This cantilever truss steel railroad bridge was built between 1888-1892 and designed by George S. Morison. (Morison also designed the Taft Bridge in Washington D.C.).

The Harahan Bridge (July 14, 1916) is a trestle railroad bridge which later added a narrow, one-way wooden cantilevering roadways along the outsides of bridge so it can be used for cars. In 1928, sparks from a train ignited and set on fire to the wooden plank road. Today, only trains use the Harahan Bridge but there are potential plans of adding a pedestrian walkway and bike path along the bridge.

The Memphis-Arkansas Bridge (December 17, 1949) , originally named E. H. Crump Bridge, carries Interstate 55 and has a pedestrian walkway. The bridge was built between 1945-1949 and is the longest Warren truss- style bridge in the United States. It is listed on the National Historic Register.

The Hernando de Soto Bridge (August 2, 1973) with its steel arches carries I-40. In 1986, the "M" shape lights became part of the bridge and Memphis landmark. The Guinness Book of World Records list the deSoto bridge for its unique structural "letter" shape. Most recently, the mysterious death of Dr. [[Don Wiley]] placed the Hernando de Soto Bridge into national headlines as well as spawning international urban legends and conspiracy theories.
