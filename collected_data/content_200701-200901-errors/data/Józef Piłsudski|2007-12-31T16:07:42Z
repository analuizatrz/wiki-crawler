He was born into a [[szlachta|noble]] family with [[Lithuanian nobility|traditions]] dating back to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. From mid–[[World War I]] until his death, Piłsudski was a major influence on Poland's government and foreign policy, and an important figure in European politics.<ref name="Plach">{{cite book | title=The Clash of Moral Nations: Cultural Politics in Pilsudski's Poland, 1926–1935| last=Plach| first=Eva| date=2006| pages=p. 14| publisher=Ohio University Press| location=Ohio, United States| id=ISBN 0821416952}}</ref> He is considered largely responsible for Poland having regained her [[independence]] in 1918, one hundred and twenty-three years after the last remnants of the [[partitions of Poland|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had been partitioned out of existence]] in 1795.<ref name="Pozeg9–11"/><ref>[[Anatol Lieven]], ''The Baltic Revolution: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Path to Independence'', Yale University Press, 1994, ISBN 0300060785, [http://books.google.com/books?id=iz3NACNOpCAC&pg=PA159&dq=Pilsudski+Polish+independence&as_brr=3&ei=7cZmR9X2G6SEjAGuoZ2nAw&sig=UF1oPw56pneIbaUzKQLxTtZkGb0 Google Book Search, p. 159].</ref><ref name="HD2">[[Jerzy Jan Lerski]], ''Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966–1945'', Greenwood Press, 1996, ISBN 0313260079, [http://books.google.com/books?id=FPxhOu_n1VYC&pg=PA441&vq=chief+restorer&dq=Pilsudski+Polish+independence&lr=&as_brr=3&sig=iJxuE4j82fjQgvWGYI-kkEwkYB0 Google Book Search, p. 441].</ref><ref>Joseph Held, ''The Columbia History of Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century'', Columbia University

From his youth, Piłsudski desired the restoration of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In his early political life, he was an influential member and later leader of the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. He considered the [[Russian Empire]] to be the most formidable obstacle to Polish independence, and created the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] which would fight alongside the [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[German Empire]]s to ensure Russia's defeat in [[World War I]]. Later in the war, he withdrew his support from the [[Central Powers]] to work with the [[Triple Entente]] for the defeat of the Central Powers. After World War I he was in charge of the Polish forces during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] (1919–21). From November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922, he was Poland's [[Chief of State]] (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'').

In 1923, as the [[Polish government]] became dominated by Piłsudski's chief opponents, the [[National Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democrats]], he withdrew from active politics.<!--citations in lead are bad style, particularly for such minor items, but if anybody is interested, see our ref 3 at http://poland.gov.pl/Jozef,Pilsudski,(1867-1935),1972.html for this one--> Three years later, however, he returned to power in the [[May Coup|May 1926 ''coup d'état'']], becoming the ''[[de facto]]'' [[dictator]] of Poland.

In 1885 Piłsudski embarked on [[medicine|medical]] studies at the [[University of Kharkov]] ([[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]), where he became involved with ''[[Narodnaya Volya]]'', part of the Russian ''[[Narodnik]]i'' revolutionary movement.<ref name="PWN">[http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3957301 Piłsudski Józef Klemens] by Andrzej Chojnowski.

In 1892 Piłsudski returned from exile. In 1893 he joined the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (''PPS'')<ref name="Poland.gov"/> and helped organize its Lithuanian branch.<ref name="Urb 88">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 88.</ref> Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible [[internationalism]] he remained a Polish nationalist.<ref name="MM-209">MacMillan, op. cit., p. 209.</ref> In 1894, as its [[chief editor]], he began publishing an [[bibuła|underground]] socialist [[newspaper]], ''[[Robotnik (1894–1939)|Robotnik]]'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers.<ref name="Poland.gov" /><ref name="Urb 93">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 93.</ref><ref name="PWN" /> In 1895, he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that [[socialist]] ideology should be merged with [[nationalist]] ideology, as that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.<ref name="PWN"/>

[[Image:Jozef Pilsudski in 1899.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Piłsudski in 1899]]
In 1899, while an underground organizer, Piłsudski married a fellow [[Socialism|socialist]] organizer, [[Maria Piłsudska|Maria Juszkiewiczowa, ''née'' Koplewska]], but the marriage deteriorated when several years later Piłsudski began an affair with a younger socialist,<ref name="MM-209"/> [[Aleksandra Piłsudska|Aleksandra Zahorska]]. Maria died in 1921, and in October that year Piłsudski married Aleksandra. They had two daughters, Wanda and Jadwiga, but this marriage was also troubled.<ref name="Aleksandra">{{pl icon}} [http://biografie.genealogiapolska.pl/index2.php?a=2&b=1352 Aleksandra Piłsudska], last accessed on [[30 May]] [[2006]].</ref>

In February 1900, after the Russian authorities found ''Robotnik'''s underground [[printing press]] in [[Łódź]], Piłsudski was imprisoned at the [[Warsaw Citadel]] but, after feigning [[mental illness]] in May 1901, he managed to escape from a [[mental hospital]] at [[Saint Petersburg]] with the help of a Polish physician, [[Władysław Mazurkiewicz (1871 - 1933)|Władysław Mazurkiewicz]], and others, fleeing to [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

At the time, when almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Piłsudski's PPS was the only political force that was prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence in order to achieve that goal.<ref name=Pidl/>

On the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904&ndash;1905), in the summer of 1904, Piłsudski traveled to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] in support of its war with Russia and proposed the creation of a [[Polish Legion]] from Poles,<ref name="Urb 109–111">Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 109–111.</ref> [[conscription|conscripted]] into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a [[Prometheism|"Promethean" project]] directed at liberating non-Russian [[ethnic]] communities living in the Russian Empire&mdash;a goal that he later continued to pursue.<ref>[[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]], ''Zbiór dokumentów ppłk. Edmunda Charaszkiewicza'' (A Collection of Documents by Lt. Col. Edmund Charaszkiewicz), p. 56.</ref>

Another notable Pole, [[Roman Dmowski]], also traveled to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting at this time a Polish revolution which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/><ref name="Urb 109–111"/> Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political arch-enemy to the end of Piłsudski's life.<ref name="Zamoyski-332">Zamoyski, op cit, p. 332.</ref> In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, while the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.<ref name="Urb 109–111"/><ref name="Poland.gov"/>

In the fall of 1904, Piłsudski formed a [[paramilitary]] unit (the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]], or ''bojówki'') aiming to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the Russian authorities.<ref name="Zamoyski-330">{{cite book | author=[[Adam Zamoyski]] | title =The Polish Way | year =1987 | pages = p. 422 | publisher =John Murray | location =London | id =ISBN 0531150690 | quote = p. 330}}</ref> The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in [[Warsaw]]; on [[October 28]], [[1904]], Russian [[Cossack]] [[cavalry]] attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on [[November 13]], Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military.<ref name="Urb 113–116">Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 113–116.</ref><ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using [[bomb]]s to [[assassinate]] selected Russian police officers.<ref name="Urb 117–118">Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 117–18.</ref>

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Russian Revolution]], Piłsudski played a leading role in events in [[Congress Poland]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> In early 1905, he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> In June 1905, Piłsudski ordered to aid an uprising in [[Łódź]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> During the "[[Łódź insurrection (1905)|June Days]]," as the Łódź uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Piłsudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his [[National Democracy|National Democrats]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> On [[December 22]], [[1905]], Piłsudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/>

Unlike the National Democrats, Piłsudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the [[First Duma]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> The decision to boycott the elections and try to win Polish independence through uprisings caused tension within the PPS, and in November 1906, the party fractured with many opposed to Piłsudski's leadership.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> Piłsudski's faction came to be called the "Old Faction" or the "Revolutionary Faction" (''Starzy'' or ''[[Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Frakcja Rewolucyjna|Frakcja Rewolucyjna]]''), while their opponents were known as the "Young Faction," "Moderate Faction" or "Left Wing" (''Młodzi'', ''Frakcja Umiarkowana'', ''[[Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Lewica|Lewica]]''). The "Young" sympathized with the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] and believed that priority should be given to cooperation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the Tsarist regime and creating a [[socialist]] [[utopia]] in which negotiations for independence would be easier.<ref name="PWN"/> Piłsudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia that would secure Polish independence.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> By 1909 Piłsudski's faction would again be the majority in the PPS, and Piłsudski would remain one of the most important PPS leaders up to the outbreak of the [[First World War]].<ref name="Urb 131">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 131.</ref>

Piłsudski anticipated a coming European war<ref name="Roos"/><ref name="JR45">Joseph Rothschild, ''East Central Europe Between the Two World Wars'', University of Washington Press, 1990, ISBN 0295953578, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ytc-muwFT_IC&pg=PA45&dq=Pilsudski+anticipated+war&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=WzB0R-_AFpjSigGyjOCIAg&sig=GmHznLgdZljDVVJRjbplooWSJ0w Google Book Search, p. 45].</ref> and the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish Army which could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had partitioned her out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906, Piłsudski, with the connivance of Austrian authorities, founded a military school in [[Kraków]] for the training of paramilitary units.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, while the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.<ref name="Urb 121–122">Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 121–22.</ref><ref name="Zamoyski-332"/>

The paramilitaries also held up Russian [[currency]] transports leaving Polish territories. On the night of September 26–27, 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train carrying [[tax revenues]] from Warsaw to St. Petersburg.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> Piłsudski, who took part in this [[Bezdany raid]] near Vilna, used the funds thus "expropriated" to fund his secret military organization<ref name="Britannica" />. The take from that single raid (200,812 [[Russian ruble|ruble]]s) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.<ref name="Urb 121–122"/>

In 1908, Piłsudski transformed his paramilitary units into an Association for Active Struggle (''[[Związek Walki Czynnej]]'', or ZWC), headed by three of his associates, [[Władysław Sikorski]], [[Marian Kukiel]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> One of the ZWC's main purposes was to train officers and [[noncommissioned officer]]s for a future Polish Army.<ref name="PWN"/>

In 1910, two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland&mdash;one in [[Lwów]] and one in Kraków&mdash;to conduct training in [[military science]]. With the permission of the Austrian authorities he founded a series of "sporting clubs," then the [[Związek Strzelecki|Riflemen's Association]], which served as cover for training a Polish military force. In 1912, Piłsudski (using the ''[[nom de guerre]]'', "''Mieczysław''") became the Commander-in-Chief of a Riflemen's Association (''Związek Strzelecki'') that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/><ref name="Poland.gov"/> In 1914, Piłsudski declared that "only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation."<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/>

At a meeting in [[Paris]] in 1914, Piłsudski presciently declared that in the imminent war, for Poland to regain her independence, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] must be beaten by the [[Central Powers]] (the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[German Empire]]s), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by [[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the [[United States]].<ref name="Roos">[[Hans Roos]], ''A History of Modern Poland, from the Foundation of the State in the First World War to the Present Day'', [[Alfred A.

Soon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Piłsudski set up another organization, the [[Polish Military Organisation]] (''Polska Organizacja Wojskowa''), which served as a precursor [[Polish intelligence]] agency and was designed to perform [[espionage]] and [[sabotage]] missions.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Cienciala"/>

Piłsudski agreed to serve in the "[[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Kingdom of Poland]]" created by the Central Powers, and acted as [[minister of war]] in the newly formed [[Polish Regency government]].<ref name="Zamoyski-333"/> In the wake of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Piłsudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men not be treated as "German [[colonial troops]]" and only be used to fight Russia. Anticipating the [[Central Powers]]' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side.<ref name="Urb 253">Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', p. 253.</ref><ref name="JR45"/> In the aftermath of a July 1917 "[[Oath Crisis]]" when Piłsudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear an [[loyalty oath|oath of loyalty]] to the [[Central Powers]], he was arrested and imprisoned at [[Magdeburg]]; the Polish units were disbanded, and the men were incorporated into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]],<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="Cienciala"/> while the [[Polish Military Organization]] began attacking German targets.<ref name="PWN"/> Piłsudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, willing to take on ''all'' the partitioning powers.<ref name="PWN"/>

On [[November 8]], [[1918]], Piłsudski and his comrade, Colonel [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], were released from Magdeburg and soon—like [[Vladimir Lenin]] before them—placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the increasingly desperate Germans hoped that Piłsudski would gather forces friendly to them.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

===Rebuilding Poland===

On [[November 11]], [[1918]], in [[Warsaw]], Piłsudski was appointed [[Commander in Chief]] of Polish forces by the [[Regency Council]] and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country; on that day (which would become [[Poland's Independence Day]]), he proclaimed an independent Polish state.<ref name="Cienciala"/> In that week he also negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from the "[[Ober Ost]]" authority; over 55,000 [[Germans]] would peacefully depart Poland afterwards, leaving their weapons to the [[Poles]]; over 400,000 total would depart Polish territories in coming months.<ref name="Cienciala"/><ref name="Urb 256 and 277–278">Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 256 and 277–278.</ref> On [[November 14]], [[1918]], he was asked to provisionally supervise the running of the country. On [[November 22]] he officially received, from the new government of [[Jędrzej Moraczewski]], the title of Provisional [[Chief of State]] (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'') of renascent Poland.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

Various Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the [[Regency Council]] in Warsaw, the government of [[Ignacy Daszyński]] in [[Lublin]], and the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] in [[Kraków]]) bowed to Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly [[socialism|socialist]] and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the [[Polish Socialist Party]], such as the [[eight-hour day]], free school education, and [[women's suffrage]]. This was necessary to avoid major unrest. However, Piłsudski believed that as head of state he must be above political parties.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Cienciala"/> The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as "[[Comrade]]" ("''Towarzysz''") and asked his support of their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: "[[Comrade]]s, I took the red [[tram]] of [[socialism]] to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off. You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other '[[Mr.|Mister]]' [rather than continue using the socialist term of address, 'Comrade']!"<ref name="Poland.gov"/> He declined to support any one party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Suleja202>[[Włodzimierz Suleja]], ''Józef Piłsudski'', Wrocław, 2004, ISBN 8304047063, p. 202.</ref> He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.

In the days immediately after World War I, Piłsudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%.<ref name="MM-210">MacMillan, op cit, p. 210.</ref> A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported, "I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn".<ref name="MM-210"/> In addition, the country had to unify the different systems of [[law]], [[economics]], and [[administration (government)|administration]] in the former German, Austrian and Russian partitions of Poland into one; there were nine [[legal system]]s, five [[currency|currencies]], 66 types of [[rail system]]s (with 165 models of [[locomotive]]s), and other similar problems, which all had to be urgently consolidated.<ref name="MM-210"/>
[[Image:Warszawaid4.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of Piłsudski before [[Warsaw]]'s [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power]]

[[Wacław Jędrzejewicz]], in ''Piłsudski: A Life for Poland'', describes Piłsudski as very deliberate in his [[decision-making]]. He collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision. Piłsudski drove himself hard, working all day and, on a regimen of tea and chain-smoked cigarettes, all night.<ref name="MM-210"/> He maintained a [[sparta]]n lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant, and became increasingly pale and thin.<ref name="MM-210"/> Though Piłsudski was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work), of a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.<ref name="MM-209"/>

Piłsudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because Piłsudski had cooperated with the Central Powers in 1914–17 and because the governments of Daszyński and [[Jędrzej Moraczewski]] were primarily socialist.<ref name="Cienciala"/> It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] became [[Prime Minister of Poland|prime minister]] and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.<ref name="Cienciala"/> That still left two separate governments claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw, and Dmowski's in [[Paris]].<ref name="MM-210"/> To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as provisional [[president]] and supreme [[commander-in-chief]] while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].<ref name="MM-213–214">MacMillan, ''op. cit.'', pp. 213–14.</ref> Articles 87–93 of the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]]<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/partiii.htm See Articles 87–93 of the Treaty].</ref> and the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]], signed on [[June 28]], [[1919]], formally established Poland as a sovereign and independent state on the international arena.<ref>Thomas D.

Piłsudski often clashed with Dmowski, at variance with the latter's vision of the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and irked by Dmowski's attempt to send the [[Blue Army]] to Poland through [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], [[Germany]] (now [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]).<ref name="MM-211 and 214">MacMillan, ''op. cit.'', pp. 211 and 214.</ref><ref name="BFG">[[Manfred F.

On [[February 20]], [[1919]], Piłsudski declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament (''[[Sejm]]''). However, the ''Sejm'' reinstated his office in the [[Little Constitution of 1919]]. The word "Provisional" was struck from his title, and Piłsudski would hold the office until [[December 9]], [[1922]], when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was elected the first [[president of Poland]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

Piłsudski's major foreign-policy initiative at this time was a proposed [[federation]] (to be called ''[[Międzymorze]]'', "Between-Seas," stretching from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea]]) of Poland with the independent [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]],<ref name="Cienciala"/> somewhat in emulation of the [[partitions of Poland|pre-partition]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]],{{Ref_label|c|c|none}} comprising a smaller Poland surrounded by a Polish-led federation of neighboring states.<ref name="PWN"/> The plan met with opposition from most of the intended members—who refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence—as well as from the Allied powers, for whom it would be too bold a change to the existing [[balance of power]] structure.<ref>Robert Szymczak,

===Polish-Soviet War===

[[Image:Jozef Pilsudski w Poznaniu.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Piłsudski in [[Poznań]]]]
In the [[aftermath of World War I]], there was unrest on all Polish borders. Regarding Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said, "All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany", while in the east "there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far."<ref name="MM-211">MacMillan, op. cit., p. 211.</ref> In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], and Piłsudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on [[12 November]] [[1918]], were to provide support for the [[Battle of Lwów (1918)|Polish struggle in Lwów]].<ref name="Urb 281">Urbankowski, op. cit., p. 281.</ref> However, while Ukrainians were the first clear enemy, it soon became apparent that the various Ukrainian factions were not the real power in that region. Coming months and years would show that the [[Bolshevik]]s were in fact the most dangerous enemy not only of renascent Poland, but of the Ukrainians.

Piłsudski was aware that the Bolsheviks were no friends of independent Poland, and that war with them was inevitable.<ref name="Urb 90–2">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 90 (second tome).</ref> He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their [[White movement|Russian-civil-war contenders]].<ref name="Kenez">[[Peter Kenez]], ''A History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, ISBN 0521311985, [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0521311985&id=aIY9qb6iIEcC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=%22Peace+of+Riga%22&sig=DOZgge7R-dNB7KTNOVV_QWrE8KI Google Book Search, p. 37].</ref> These "White Russians"—representative of the old [[Russian Empire]]—were willing to accept only limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former [[Congress Poland]], and clearly objected to Ukrainian independence, which was crucial for Piłsudski's [[Międzymorze]] project.<ref name="Urb 83–2">{{pl icon}} [[Bohdan Urbankowski]], ''Józef Piłsudski: marzyciel i strateg'', (Józef Piłsudski: Dreamer and Strategist), Tom drugi (second volume), Wydawnictwo ALFA, Warsaw, 1997, ISBN 8370019145, p. 83.</ref>

This was in contrast to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void.<ref name="Urb 291">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 291.</ref> Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire.<ref name="Kenez"/><ref name="Urb 45–2">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 45 (second tome).</ref> By ignoring the strong pressures from the [[Entente Cordiale]] to join the attack on [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s struggling [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.<ref name="Urb 92–2">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 92 (second tome).</ref>

In the wake of the [[Russian westward offensive of 1918–1919]] and of a series of escalating battles which resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on [[April 21]], [[1920]], [[Marshal]] Piłsudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a [[military alliance]] (the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]]) with Ukrainian leader [[Symon Petliura]] to conduct joint operations against [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]].

On [[July 1]], [[1920]], in view of the rapidly advancing Soviet offensive, Poland's parliament, the ''[[Sejm]]'', formed a [[Council for Defense of the Nation]].

As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in the WWI he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente.

Piłsudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the [[Vistula River]] and defend the bridgeheads at Warsaw and on the [[Wieprz River]], while some 25% of available [[division (military)|divisions]] concentrated to the south for a strategic counter-offensive. The plan next required two armies under General [[Józef Haller de Hallenburg|Józef Haller]], facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General [[Władysław Sikorski]] was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelope the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled "Reserve Army" (also known as the "Strike Group," "''Grupa Uderzeniowa''"), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units and commanded personally by Piłsudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]]. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the "Strike Group" would close near the [[East Prussia]]n border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.<ref name="Cisek">[[Janusz Cisek]], ''Kosciuszko, We Are Here: American Pilots of the Kosciuszko Squadron in Defense of Poland, 1919–1921'', McFarland & Company, 2002, ISBN 0786412402, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0786412402&id=hNuGZOGk6UoC&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&q=Rozwadowski&vq=Rozwadowski&dq=Rozwadowski&sig=Gzm5trogxhMjygu0qBKsACesExw Google Book Search, pp. 140–41].</ref><ref name="Urb 346–441">Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 346–441 and 357–58.</ref>

At the time, Piłsudski's plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including [[decryption|decrypted]] Soviet [[radio]] communications, the plan was termed "amateurish" by high-ranking army officers and military experts who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education.

After the Polish [[March Constitution|Constitution of March 1921]] severely limited the powers of the [[presidency]] under the [[Second Polish Republic]], Piłsudski refused to run for president.<ref name="PWN"/> On [[December 9]], [[1922]], the Polish [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|National Assembly]] elected [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] of ''[[Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe Wyzwolenie|PSL Wyzwolenie]]''; his election was opposed by the right-wing parties and caused increasing unrest.<ref name="Urb 487-488">Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', pp. 487–88.</ref> On [[December 13]], at the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Piłsudski officially transferred his powers as [[Chief of State]] to his friend Narutowicz; the ''Naczelnik'' was replaced by the President.<ref name="Urb 488">Urbankowski, ''op. cit.'', p. 488.</ref><ref>"Piłsudski, Józef (Klemens)," ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'', 15th ed., 2005, vol. 9, p. 445.</ref>

Only days after his inauguration, on [[December 16]], [[1922]], Narutowicz was shot dead by a mentally deranged, [[right-wing]], [[anti-Semitic]] painter and art critic, [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]], who had originally wanted to kill Piłsudski but had changed his target, influenced by  right-wing [[National Democracy|National-Democrat]] anti-Narutowicz propaganda.<ref name="Urb 489">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 489.</ref> For Piłsudski this was a major shock, an event that shook his belief that Poland could function as a [[democracy]]<ref name="Suleja300>Suleja, op.cit., p. 300.</ref> and made him believe in government by a strong hand.<ref>[[Norman Davies]].

[[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] of ''[[Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe Piast|PSL Piast]]'', another of Piłsudski's old colleagues, was elected the new president, and [[Wincenty Witos]], also of ''PSL Piast'', became [[Prime Minister of Poland|prime minister]]. But the new government—following the [[Lanckorona Pact]], an alliance among the centrist ''PSL Piast'' and the right-wing [[National Populist Union]] and [[Polskie Stronnictwo Chrześcijańskiej Demokracji|Christian Democrat]] parties—contained right-wing enemies of Piłsudski, people whom he held morally responsible for Narutowicz's death and whom he found it impossible to work with.<ref name="Urb 490–491">Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 490–491.</ref> On [[May 30]], [[1923]], Piłsudski resigned as Chief of the General Staff.

Meanwhile Poland's economy was in shambles. [[Hyperinflation]] fueled public unrest, and the government was unable to find a quick solution to the mounting [[unemployment]] and [[economic crisis]].<ref name="Urb 502">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 502.</ref> Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centered around former members of the [[Polish Legions]] and the [[Polish Military Organization]] as well as some [[left-wing]] and [[intelligentsia]] parties.

When the [[Chjeno-Piast]] coalition, which Piłsudski had strongly criticized, formed a new government,<ref name="PWN"/> on May 12–14, 1926, Piłsudski returned to power in a ''[[coup d'état]]'' (the [[May Coup]]), supported by the [[Polish Socialist Party]], [[PSL Wyzwolenie|Liberation]], the [[Stronnictwo Chłopskie|Peasant Party]], and even the [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]].<ref name="Urb 515">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 515.</ref> Piłsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down;<ref name="Suleja343">Suleja, op.cit., p. 343.</ref>  215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.<ref>{{pl icon}} [[Wojciech Roszkowski]] Historia Polski 1914–1991, Warszawa, 1992 ISBN 83-01-11014-7, pg 53 section 5.1.</ref> 

On May 31, the ''[[Sejm]]'' elected Piłsudski president of the Republic.  Piłsudski, however, aware of the presidency's limited powers, refused the office. Another of his old friends, [[Ignacy Mościcki]], was elected in his stead. Piłsudski's formal offices—apart from two terms as [[prime minister]] in 1926–28 and 1930—would for the most part remain limited to those of [[minister of defense]] and [[inspector-general]] of the [[Polish Armed Forces]]. He also served as minister of military affairs and chairman of the war council.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

===Authoritarian rule===
Piłsudski had no plans for major reforms; he quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters, declaring that his coup was to be a "revolution without revolutionary consequences."<ref name="PWN"/> His goals were to stabilize the country, reduce the influence of [[political party|political parties]], which he blamed for [[corruption]] and inefficiency, and strengthen the army.<ref name="Urb 528–529">Urbankowski, op.cit., pp. 528–529.</ref><ref name="PWN"/>

====Internal politics====
[[Image:5 Warszawa 083.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], [[Warsaw]], Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power]]

In internal politics, Piłsudski's coup entailed sweeping limitations on parliamentary government, as his [[Sanacja|Sanation]] regime (1926–1939)—at times employing [[authoritarian]] methods—sought to "restore [[public life]] to moral health." From 1928, the Sanation authorities were represented in the sphere of practical politics by the [[Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]] (''BBWR''). Popular support and an effective propaganda apparatus allowed Piłsudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled by the president, who was appointed by Piłsudski, not by the ''[[Sejm]]''.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> The powers of the ''Sejm'' were curtailed by [[August Novelization|constitutional amendments]] introduced soon after the coup, on [[August 2]], [[1926]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/> From 1926 to 1930, Piłsudski relied chiefly on [[propaganda]] to weaken the influence of opposition leaders.<ref name="PWN"/> The culmination of his dictatorial and supralegal policies came in 1930 with the imprisonment and [[Brest trial|trial of certain political opponents]] on the eve of the 1930 [[Polish legislative election, 1930|Polish legislative elections]], and with the 1934 establishment of a [[Bereza Kartuska Detention Camp|prison]] for [[political prisoner]]s at [[Bereza Kartuska]] (today [[Biaroza]]),<ref name="PWN"/> where some prisoners were brutally mistreated.<ref>{{pl icon}} [[Wojciech Śleszyński]], [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://kamunikat.net.iig.pl/www/czasopisy/bzh/20/15.htm Aspekty prawne utworzenia obozu odosobnienia w Berezie Kartuskiej i reakcje środowisk politycznych.

Nonetheless, Piłsudski's government depended more on his [[charismatic authority]] than on [[rational-legal authority]].<ref name="PWN"/> None of his followers could claim to be his legitimate heir, and after his death the [[Sanacja|Sanation]] structure would quickly fracture, with Poland returning to the pre-Piłsudski era of parliamentary political contention.<ref name="PWN"/>

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983, p. 182. ISBN 0521275016.</ref>

In the military sphere, Piłsudski, who had shown himself an accomplished military strategist in engineering the "[[Miracle at the Vistula]]," has been criticized by some for subsequently concentrating on [[personnel management]] and allegedly neglecting modernization of military [[strategy]] and equipment.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Garlicki178">Andrzej Garlicki, ''Jozef Pilsudski. 1867–1935''.

====Foreign policy====
[[Image:Pilsudski by Kossak portrait.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Marshal Piłsudski.  Painting by [[Wojciech Kossak]], ca. 1928.]]
Under Piłsudski's direction, Poland had good [[foreign relations]] with some of its neighbors, notably the [[Kingdom of Romania]], [[Hungary]] and [[Latvia]]. However, relations with [[Czechoslovakia]] were strained, and even worse with [[Lithuania]].<ref name="Goldstein-29">[[Erik Goldstein]], ''The First World War Peace Settlements, 1919-1925'', Pearson Education, 2002, ISBN 0582311454, [http://books.google.com/books?id=H5WzZoCYAjoC&pg=PA29&vq=%22Poland+also+fought+a+war+with+Lithuania%22+%22the+struggle+with+Czechoslovakia%22&dq=Poland+Lithuania+Czechoslovakia+World+War+Pilsudski&as_brr=3&sig=oth2u2gZVp8EQRB0s1tHRKPL8lQ Google Book Search, p. 29].</ref> Relations with [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) varied over time, but during Piłsudski's tenure could for the most part be described as neutral.<ref name="Urb 538">Urbankowski, op.cit., p. 538.</ref><ref name="Ilya Prizel"/><ref name="Urb 539–540"/>

Piłsudski's [[Prometheism|Promethean]] program, designed to weaken the Russian Empire and its successor, the Soviet Union, by supporting [[nationalism|nationalist]] independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia or the Soviet Union, was coordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe by the [[military intelligence]] officer [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]]. The Prometheist movement, however, yielded few tangible results.<ref name="Char">{{pl icon}} [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]], ''Zbiór dokumentów ppłk.

Piłsudski, as [[Charles de Gaulle]] was later to do in [[France]], sought to maintain his country's independence on the international scene. Assisted by his protégé, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Józef Beck]], he sought support for Poland in alliances with western powers, such as France and the [[United Kingdom]], and with friendly, if less powerful, neighbors, such as Romania and Hungary.<ref name="Urb 539–540"/> A supporter of the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]] and the [[Polish-Romanian Alliance]] (part of the [[Little Entente]]), he was disappointed by the French and British policy of [[appeasement]] evident in those countries' signing of the [[Locarno Treaties]].<ref name="Ilya Prizel">[[Ilya Prizel]], ''National Identity and Foreign Policy: Nationalism and Leadership in Poland, Russia and Ukraine'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, ISBN 0521576970, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521576970&id=fE2quB852jcC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=Pilsudski+wealth&sig=MmY_fMN0nBIs5qFavD_godqa-0Q Google Book Search, p. 71].</ref><ref name="JLu">[[John Lukacs]], '' The Last European War: September 1939-December 1941'', Yale University Press, 2001, ISBN 0300089155 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300089155&id=5wktT0vEYgkC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&sig=Lp1a7st1SGuMJfKpvFWzLqOtm0w Google Book Search, p. 30].</ref><ref name="NJ">[[Nicole Jordan]], ''The Popular Front and Central Europe: The Dilemmas of French Impotence 1918–1940'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, ISBN 0521522420, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521522420&id=4iQQrESpA48C&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&sig=La39fTfAVC8dXNTUcbufCrapDTk Google Book Search, p. 23].</ref> Piłsudski therefore aimed to also maintain good relations with the USSR and Germany; hence Poland signed [[non-aggression pact]]s with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 [[Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] and the 1934 [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]].<ref name="Urb 539–540"/> The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> Piłsudski himself was acutely aware of the shakiness of the pacts, and remarked, "Having these pacts, we are straddling two stools.

There is controversy about Piłsudski's rumored proposal to France on declaring war on Germany after [[Adolf Hitler]] had [[Machtergreifung|come to power]] in January 1933. Some historians argue that Piłsudski may have sounded out France regarding the possibility of joint military action against Germany, which had been openly rearming in violation of the [[Versailles Treaty]].<ref name="Urb 317–326-2">Urbankowski, op.cit., vol.2, p. 317–326.</ref> French refusal might have been one of the reasons Poland signed the [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] in January 1934.<ref name="TT_NGP">[[Tomasz Torbus]], ''Nelles Guide Poland'', Hunter Publishing, Inc, 1999, ISBN 3886180883 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN3886180883&id=xH6iEYILvuYC&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&sig=hV7b1WHEJzrnGCt0vGkG_Bp_OtM Google Book Search, p. 25].</ref><ref name="GQH">[[George H.

Hitler unceasingly proposed a German-Polish alliance against the Soviets, but Piłsudski declined, instead seeking precious time to prepare for war with Germany or the Soviet Union if need be.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/><ref name="Hildebrand">[[Klaus Hildebrand]], ''The Foreign Policy of the Third Reich'', University of California Press, 1973, ISBN 0520025288 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520025288&id=bJWegl8wnF8C&pg=PA33&lpg=PA32&dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&sig=2AztWI0oGOImsxOscknyLP4GdJ8 Google Book Search, p. 33].</ref> Hitler also on numerous occasions hoped to meet with Piłsudski, and again was rebuffed.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/> Just before his death, Piłsudski told Beck that Poland's policy must be to maintain neutral relations with Germany, an alliance with France, and improve relations with United Kingdom.<ref name="Urb 539–540"/>

===Death===

By 1935, unbeknown to the public, Piłsudski had for several years been in declining health. On [[May 12]], [[1935]], he died of [[liver cancer]] at [[Warsaw]]'s [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]]. The celebration of his life had begun spontaneously within half an hour after his death had been announced.<ref name="Pozeg5">[[Zbigniew Wojcik]], ''Przedmowa'', in [[Marian Marek Drozdowski]], [[Hanna Szwankowska]], ''Pożegnanie Marszałka: antologia tekstów historycznych i literackich'', Oficyna Wydawnicza "Typografika", 1995, ISBN 8386417188, p. 5.</ref> It was led by military personnel—former [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legionnaires]], members of the [[Polish Military Organization]], veterans of the wars of 1919–21, and his political collaborators from his time as [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State]] and, later, prime minister.<ref name="Pozeg9–11">Marian Marek Drozdowski, ''Przedmowa'', in [[Marian Marek Drozdowski]], [[Hanna Szwankowska]], ''Pożegnanie Marszałka: antologia tekstów historycznych i literackich'', Oficyna Wydawnicza "Typografika", 1995, ISBN 8386417188, pp. 9–11.</ref>

The [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]] immediately attacked Piłsudski as a [[fascist]] and [[capitalist]].<ref name="Pozeg9–11"/> Other opponents of the [[sanacja|Sanation]] regime, however, were more civil; [[socialist]]s (such as [[Ignacy Daszyński]] and [[Tomasz Arciszewski]]) and [[Polish Christian Democratic Party|Christian Democrats]] (represented by [[Ignacy Paderewski]], [[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] and [[Władysław Grabski]]) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions ([[Wincenty Witos]] voicing criticism of Piłsudski, but [[Maciej Rataj]] and [[Stanisław Thugutt]] being supportive), while [[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] expressed a toned-down criticism.<ref name="Pozeg9–11"/>

Condolences were expressed by Polish [[Catholic]] clergy—by [[primate of Poland|Poland's Primate]] [[August Hlond]]—as well as by [[Pope Pius XI]], who called himself a "personal friend" of the Marshal.<ref name="Pozeg9–11"/> Notable appreciation for Piłsudski was expressed by Poland's ethnic and religious minorities. [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Protestant]], [[Judaism|Judaic]] and [[Islam]]ic organizations expressed condolences, praising Piłsudski for his policies of [[religious tolerance]].<ref name="Pozeg9–11"/> Mainstream organizations of ethnic minorities similarly expressed their support for his policies of ethnic tolerance, though he was criticized, similarly to the communists, by Jewish ([[General Jewish Labor Union|BUND]]), Ukrainian, German and Lithuanian extremists.<ref name="Pozeg9–11"/>

On the international scene, Pope Pius XI held a special ceremony May 18 in the [[Holy See]], a commemoration was conducted at [[League of Nations]] [[Geneva]] headquarters, and dozens of messages of condolence arrived in Poland from [[head of state|heads of state]] across the world, including Germany's [[Adolf Hitler]], the Soviet Union's [[Joseph Stalin]], Italy's [[Benito Mussolini]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], France's [[Albert Lebrun]] and [[Pierre-Étienne Flandin]], Austria's [[Wilhelm Miklas]], Japan's Emperor [[Hirohito]], and Britain's King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].<ref name="Pozeg9–11"/>

After a two-year display at [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] in [[Kraków]]'s [[Wawel Cathedral]], Piłsudski's body was laid to rest in the Cathedral's Crypt under the Silver Bells, except for his brain, which he had willed for study to [[Vilnius University|Stefan Batory University]], and his heart, which was interred in his mother's grave at [[Vilnius]]' [[Rossa Cemetery]], where it remains.<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref>{{cite book | first= Richard| last= [[Watt]] | title=Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate 1918–1939 | location= New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year=1979 | id=ISBN 0-671-22625-8 | pages = p. 338}}</ref>

On [[May 13]], [[1935]], in accordance with Piłsudski's last wishes, [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] was named by Poland's president and government to be [[Inspector-General]] of the [[Polish Armed Forces]], and on [[November 10]], [[1936]], he was elevated to [[Marshal of Poland]].<ref name="JabStaw13">Marek Jabłonowski, Piotr Stawecki, ''Następca komendanta.

After the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland in 1939]], some of this political division survived within the [[Polish government in exile]].

Piłsudski had given Poland something akin to what [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s [[Onufry Zagłoba]] had mused about: a Polish [[Oliver Cromwell]]. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.<ref name="TT_NGP"/><ref name="Goldfarb">[[Jeffrey C.

In 1935, at Piłsudski's funeral, President Mościcki had [[eulogy|eulogized]] the Marshal: "He was the king of our hearts and the sovereign of our will.

After [[World War II]], little of Piłsudski's thought influenced the policies of the [[Polish People's Republic]], a ''de facto'' [[satellite state|satellite]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. Piłsudski was either ignored or condemned by the communist government, along with the entire period of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. This changed over time, however, particularly after [[destalinization]] and the [[Polish October]] (1956), and evolving Polish historiography moved away from a purely negative view of him toward a more balanced and neutral view.<ref name="nalamach">Władysław Władyka, ''Z Drugą Rzeczpospolitą na plecach.

After the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]], Piłsudski once again came to be publicly acknowledged as a [[national hero]].<ref name="Roshwald"/> On the sixtieth anniversary of his death, on [[May 12]], [[1995]], Poland's ''[[Sejm]]'' adopted a resolution: "Józef Piłsudski will remain, in our nation's memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization.

==Notes==
'''a.''' {{Note_label|a|a|none}} Józef Klemens Piłsudski was commonly referred to without his middle name, as "Józef Piłsudski." A few English sources translate his first name as "Joseph," but this is not the common practice. As a young man, he belonged to underground organizations and used various pseudonyms, including "''Wiktor''," "''Mieczysław''" and "''Ziuk''" (the latter also being his family nickname). Later he was often affectionately called "''Dziadek''" ("Grandpa" or "the Old Man") and "''Marszałek''" ("the Marshal"). His ex-soldiers from the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legions]] also referred to him as "''Komendant''" ("the Commandant").

'''b.''' {{Note_label|b|b|none}}Piłsudski sometimes spoke of being a Lithuanian of Polish culture.<ref>[[Norman Davies]], ''Heart of Europe: A Short History of Poland'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1984, ISBN 0-19-285152-7, p. 139.</ref> The question of his ethnicity and culture is not a simple one. [[Timothy Snyder]], who calls him a "Polish-Lithuanian," notes that Piłsudski did not think in terms of 20th-century [[nationalism]]s and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]]; he considered himself ''both'' a Pole and a Lithuanian, and his homeland was the historic [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref>{{cite web

[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], in his introduction to [[Wacław Jędrzejewicz]]’s ''Pilsudski: A Life for Poland'', writes: "Some years before his death Pilsudski, in a statement which epitomises the essence of modern Polish history, stated: 'To be defeated and not yield is victory. To win and to rest on laurels is defeat.' [...] Pilsudski’s vision of Poland, paradoxically, was never attained. He contributed immensely to the creation of a modern Polish state, to the preservation of Poland from the Soviet invasion, yet he failed to create the kind of multinational commonwealth, based on principles of social justice and ethnic tolerance, to which he aspired in his youth. One may wonder how relevant was his image of such a Poland in the age of nationalism..."<ref>[[Wacław Jędrzejewicz]], ''Pilsudski: A Life For Poland'', Hippocrene Books, 1991, ISBN 0870527479.</ref>
