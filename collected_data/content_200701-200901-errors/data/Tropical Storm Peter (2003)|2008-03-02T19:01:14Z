'''Tropical Storm Peter''' was a short-lived tropical storm that developed outside of the typical [[Atlantic hurricane]] season. Forming from an [[extratropical]] storm, Peter was initially a [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical storm]] with minimal convection near its center. As it moved towards warmer waters, the system organized, and transitioned into a [[tropical cyclone]] on [[December 9]]. With the development of an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] feature, Peter approached hurricane status to reach peak winds of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h), though upper level shear and cooler waters quickly weakened the storm. Peter became extratropical on [[December 11]], and was absorbed by a cold front shortly thereafter.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Peter 2003 track.png}}
An [[extratropical]] cyclone developed on [[December 2]] in the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]] about 1430&nbsp;miles (2300&nbsp;km) southwest of the [[Azores]] islands. It tracked northwestward, then turned to the north, and developed gale force winds on [[December 4]] after turning to the northeast. Later that day it transitioned into a frontal low,<ref name="davidroth">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Peter track prior to cyclogenesis|accessdate=2006-10-12|url=http://www.australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/trak0312.htm}}</ref> and as high pressures persisted across the northeast Atlantic Ocean<ref name="dec4">{{cite web|author=Formosa|year=2003|title=December 4 Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-10-12|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Atl-Dis/2003/Dec/2003120500.AXNT20}}</ref> the storm turned to the southeast. The system lost its frontal character early on [[December 7]] as it turned to the south-southwest,<ref name="davidroth"/> Later that day, the gale developed convection near the center, and it is estimated the system organized into a [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical storm]] late on December 7 while located 835&nbsp;miles (1340&nbsp;km) south-southwest of the Azores. As the system moved to the southwest over warmer waters, deep convection continued to develop over the storm. The convection concentrated near the center as well-defined [[rainbands|banding features]] developed around the center. Based on the organization, the [[National Hurricane Center]] declared the system Tropical Storm Peter on [[December 9]] while located 980&nbsp;miles (1580&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Praia]] in the [[Cape Verde]] islands.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Peter Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-12|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003peter.shtml}}</ref> 

Several days prior to the formation of Peter, computer models forecasted the development of the storm.<ref name="tcr"/> As it transitioned into a 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm, Peter was moving slowly, and initial forecasts expected rapid weakening.<ref name="peterdisc1">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Peter Discussion One|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-12|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al212003.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> However, an [[Eye (cyclone)|eye feature]] quickly developed within the convection, and the storm strengthened to reach peak winds of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) late on [[December 9]]. Though the presence of the eye feature along with [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) would usually indicate a tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity, Peter remained a tropical storm, and the eye feature quickly began to dissipate. The storm tracked northward ahead of the same [[cold front|frontal system]] that absorbed [[Tropical Storm Odette (2003)|Tropical Storm Odette]], and the combination of strong upper-level winds and cooler water temperatures quickly weakened the storm. By [[December 10]] Peter degenerated into a tropical depression, consisting of a tight low-level circulation comprised of low clouds. As the system turned to the northeast over progressively cooler waters, Peter transitioned into an [[extratropical]] depression on [[December 11]]. Shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the approaching cold front.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Impact and records==
Peter remained over the open [[Atlantic Ocean]] for its entire lifetime, and did not affect land. With the development of Tropical Storms Peter and Odette, the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season|2003 season]] became the first year since [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887]] that two storms developed in the month of December.<ref name="tcr"/> At the time, after the development of Peter, the 2003 season was tied for the [[List of notable Atlantic hurricanes#Listed by most total storms|fifth most-active Atlantic hurricane season]], though it has since dropped to sixth after the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]]. The 235 days between the development of the first storm, [[Tropical Storm Ana (2003)|Tropical Storm Ana]], and the dissipation of the last storm, Peter, made the 2003 season the longest season since [[1952 Atlantic hurricane season|1952]]. Peter is one of only three [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane seasons]] to reach the "P" name since [[List of historic tropical cyclone names|naming]] began in 1950.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurdat Data for Tropical Cyclones 1851-2005|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2006-10-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt}}</ref>
