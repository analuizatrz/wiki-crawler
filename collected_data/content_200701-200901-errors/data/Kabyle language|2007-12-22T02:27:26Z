'''Kabyle''' is a [[Berber language]] (Kabyle: ''{{unicode|Ṯaq<u>b</u>ayliṯ}}'', {{Audio|Taqbaylit.ogg|'''Taqbaylit'''}}, {{pronounced|ˌθaqβajˈliθ}}) spoken by the [[Kabyle people]]. In [[1995]], there were 3,123,000 speakers worldwide, the majority in [[Algeria]], where there were more than 2,000,000. However, according to [[INALCO]] estimates, there are 5.5 million speakers in Algeria and about 7 million worldwide.

Kabyle was (with some exceptions) rarely written before the [[20th century]]; however, in recent years a small but increasing body of literature has been printed. The originally [[Oral literature|oral poetry]] of [[Si Mohand]] is particularly notable in this respect. Famous Kabyle singers include [[Lounès Matoub|Matoub Lounes]], [[Idir]] and [[Ait Menguellet]].

==Classification==
The classification of Kabyle is [[Afro-Asiatic]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Northern Berber languages|Northern]].

==Geographic distribution==
Kabyle is a [[Berber languages|Berber language]] native to [[Kabylie]], it is present in seven [[Algeria]]n districts.

The populations of [[Tizi Ouzou]], [[Béjaïa|Béjaïa (Bgayet)]] and [[Bouira|Bouira (Tubiret)]] are in majority Kabyle-speaking. Kabyle is majority language in [[Bordj Bou Arreridj]], [[Sétif]] and a minority language in [[Boumerdes]] and [[Jijel]] where it coexists with [[Algerian Arabic]]. 

Kabyle is also spoken as a mother tongue among the Kabyle diaspora in Algerian and European cities (mainly [[France]]). It is estimated that half of Kabyles live outside Kabylie.

===Official status===
Berber languages have no official status in [[Algeria]]. Kabyle faces an unfavourable environment in this nation, although there exists a public radio (Channel II, which dates back to the [[Algerian revolution]]), and some TV news reports on the unique Algerian TV channel. Since private ownership of TV channels is illegal in Algeria, Kabyles have launched a private Kabyle speaking TV channel that broadcasts from Paris, France ([[Berbère Télévision]]).

In 1994, Kabyle pupils and students boycotted Algerian schools for a year, demanding for the officialization of Berber, leading to the symbolic creation of the "Haut Commissariat à l'Amazighité" (HCA) in 1995. Berber languages were subsequently taught as a non-compulsory language in Berber speaking areas.

After the tragic events of the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]] in 2001, The Kabyle population organized itself under the label of the [[Arouch]]. One of their main goals was to officially recognize Berber. President [[Bouteflika]] said "Berber will never be an official language, and if it has to be a national language, it has to be submitted to a referendum," <ref>[http://www.amazighworld.org/history/amazighophobia/algeria/boutefliqa/boutef.php]</ref> however he had to submit to the pressure of the Black spring and recognize Berber as a "national language" without a referendum.

In 2005, [[Bouteflika]] contradicted himself about the Berber issue, saying that "there is no country in the world that has two official languages" and that "this will never be the case of Algeria".<ref>[http://www.algeria-watch.org/fr/article/pol/kabylie/declarations_bouteflika.htm]</ref>

===Varieties===

From west to east, some linguists distinguish four zones characterized by three distinct—but mutually intelligible—pronunciations in the following regions:
At the west of Tizi Ghenif, Kabylie of the Djurdjura, Soummam valley and the zone starting from Bejaïa to the east.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
The phonemes below reflect the pronunciation of Kabyle.

===Vowels===
Kabyle language has four vowels: (e is not considered to be a true vowel, it just makes the reading easier)
* {{IPA|/a/}} {{IPA|[æ]}}
* {{IPA|/e/}}  {{IPA|[ə]}}
* {{IPA|/i/}} {{IPA|[ɪ]}}
* {{IPA|/u/}}  {{IPA|[ʊ]}}

Historically, schwa (e) is thought to be the result of a pan-Berber reduction or merger of three other vowels. The phonetic realization of the vowels, especially {{IPA|/a/}}, is influenced by the character of the surrounding consonants; emphatic consonants invite a more open realization of the vowel, e.g. {{unicode|aẓru}} = {{IPA|[az̴ru]}} 'stone' vs. amud = {{IPA|[æmud]}} 'seed'.

|}

===Assimilation===
Inside the Kabyle language there are various accents which are the result of assimilations (these accents are generally divided into western and eastern Kabyle). Some of these assimilations are present among all Kabyle "dialects" and some not. These assimilations are not noted in writing, such as:

*« Axxam n wergaz. » — "The house of the man." is pronounced either « Axxam n wergaz. » or « Axxam bb wergaz » or « Axxam pp wergaz » ...etc. (N+W=BB)
*« D taqcict. » — "It's a girl."  is pronounced  « Tsaqcict ». (D+T=TS)
*Here is a list of some of these assimilations: D+T=TS, T+T=TS, N+W=BB/PP, I+Y=IG, W+W=BB, Y+Y=GG.

[[Gemination]] affects the quality of certain consonants, turning [[fricative]]s into [[stop]]s; in particular, geminated ɣ becomes qq and y becomes gg.

===Fricatives vs Stops===
Kabyle is mostly composed of fricatives phonemes which are originally stops in other Berber languages, but in writing there is no difference between fricatives and stops. Below is a list of fricatives vs stops and when they are pronounced (note that [[gemination]] turns [[fricative]]s into [[stop]]s).

==Writing system==
{{Main|Kabyle alphabet}}
[[Image:Kabylia-3lingual sign.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A trilingual sign in Algeria, written in Arabic, French, and Kabyle (using Tifinagh).]]
The most ancient Berber writings were written in the Libyco-Berber script ([[Tifinagh]]). Such writings have been found in Kabylie and continue to be discovered by [[archeologist]]s.

During the [[Middle Ages]], religious literature in Kabylie was written in the [[Arabic language]], which was sometimes annotated with [[footnote]]s in Kabyle using the [[Arabic script]], however, entire texts were not written in Kabyle.

During the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] era, the first [[French language|French]]-Kabyle [[dictionary]] was compiled by a [[France|French]] [[ethnologist]] in the 18th century. It was written in the [[Latin script]] with an [[orthography]] based on that of [[French orthography|French]]. Other dictionaries were edited when the French colonized [[North Africa]], mainly by priests, the [[White Fathers|pères blancs]], who also compiled dictionaries in [[Algerian Arabic]]. They also collected many stories from the local population.

By the beginning of the 20th century, contributions of educated Kabyles in their own language, and written in the Latin script, began appearing―"tamacahutt n wuccen" by Brahim Zellal being an example of this trend.

After the [[History of Algeria|independence of Algeria]], some Kabyle activists tried to revive the Libyco-Berber script, which is still in use by the [[Tuareg]]. Attempts were made to modernize the writing system by modifying the shape of the letters and by adding vowels, but its use remains limited to [[logo]]s. Kabyle literature continued to be written in the Latin script. This new version of Tifinagh has been called [[Neo-Tifinagh]] and has been adopted as the official script of Berber languages in [[Morocco]].

[[Mouloud Mammeri]] codified a new orthography for the writing of the Kabyle language which avoided the use of the archaic French orthography. His script has been adopted by all Berber linguists, the [[INALCO]] and the Algerian HCA. It uses diacritics and two letters from the extended Latin alphabet : [[Ɛ]]ɛ [[Č]]č [[Ḍ]]ḍ [[Ǧ]]ǧ [[Ḥ]]ḥ [[Ɣ]]ɣ [[Ṭ]]ṭ [[Ṣ]]ṣ [[Ẓ]]ẓ.

== Grammar ==
===Nouns and adjectives===
====Gender====
As an [[Afro-asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language]], Kabyle has only two [[Grammatical gender|genders]], Masculine and Feminine. Like most [[Berber languages]], masculine nouns and adjectives generally start with a vowel (''a-'', ''i-'', ''u-''), while the feminine nouns generally start with ''t-'' and end with a ''-t'' (there are some exceptions, however). Note that most feminine nouns are in fact feminized versions of masculine nouns.

Examples: 
*''Aqcic'' "a boy", '''''t'''aqcic'''t''''' "a girl".
*''Amɣar'' "an old man", '''''t'''amɣar'''t''''' "an old woman".
*''Argaz'' "a man", Tame{{unicode|ṭṭ}}ut "a woman".
*''Izi'' "a fly", ''Tizit'' "mosquito".

====Pluralization====
Singular nouns generally start with an ''a-'', and do no have a suffix. Plural nouns generally start with an ''i-'' and often have a suffix such as ''-en''. There are three types of plural : external, [[Broken plural|Internal]], mix:

*External or "regular": consists in changing the initial vowel of the noun, and adding a [[suffix]] -n,
::'''''a'''m{{unicode|ɣ}}ar'' "an old man" → '''''i'''mɣar'''en''''' "old men".
::'''a'''fus → '''i'''fas'''en''' "hands"
::'''a'''rgaz → '''i'''rgaz'''en''' "men"
::ul → ulaw'''en''' "hearts"

*Internal: involves only a change in the vowels within the word:
::adrar → id'''u'''rar "mountain"
::amic'''i'''c "a cat" → imc'''a'''c "cats"

*Mix: combines a change of vowels (within the word) with the suffix ''-n'': 
::igenn'''i''' "sky" → igenwa'''n''' "skies".
::iz'''i''' → iz'''an''' "fly"
::a{{unicode|ẓ}}'''a'''r → i{{unicode|ẓ}}'''u'''r'''an''' "root"

====Free and annexed state====
As in all Berber languages, Kabyle has two types of states or [[grammatical case|cases]] of the [[noun]], organized [[Ergative case|ergatively]]: one is unmarked, while the other serves as the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called ''free state'', the latter ''construct state''. The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:

The first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel ''a'' become ''u'' :
::amaziɣ → umaziɣ "Berber"
::ameqqran → umeqqran "big"
::adrar → udrar "mountain"
The second involves the loss of the initial vowel in the case of some feminine nouns (e is not considered to be a true vowel, it just makes the reading easier):
::t'''a'''mɣart → t'''e'''mɣart "women"
::t'''a'''mdint → t'''e'''mdint "town"
::t'''a'''murt → tmurt "country"
The third involves the addition of a semi-vowel (''w'' or ''y'') word-initially:
::asif → '''w'''asif "river"
::a{{unicode|ḍ}}u → '''w'''a{{unicode|ḍ}}u "wind"
::iles → '''y'''iles "tongue"
::uccen → '''w'''uccen "jackal"
Finally, some nouns do not change for free state:
::taddart → taddart "village"
::tuccent → tuccent "female jackal"

Depending on the role of the noun in the sentence, it takes either its free or annexed state:

*Free: ''Yewwet '''a'''qcic''. "He has beaten a boy". (Verb-Object)
*Annexed: ''Yewwet '''we'''qcic''. "The boy has beaten". (Verb-Subject)

After a preposition (at the exception of "ar" and "s"), all nouns take their annexed state:

*Free state: '''A'''man (water), Kas n '''wa'''man (a glass of water).

===Verbs===
There are three tenses : the [[Preterite]] (past), intensive Aorist (present perfect, present continuous, past continuous) and the future (Ad+Aoriste). Unlike other Berber languages, the [[aorist]] alone is rarely used in Kabyle (In the other languages it is used to express the present). 

*"Weak verbs" have a preterite form that is the same as their aoriste. Examples of weak verbs that follow are conjugated at the first person of the singular:

{| class="wikitable"

|- 
! Aru (to write)
|  uriɣ
|  ad aruɣ

|}

===Conjugation===
[[Grammatical conjugation|Conjugation]] in Kabyle is done by adding suffixes (prefixes, postfixes or both). These suffixes are static and identical for all tenses (only the theme changes):

{| class="wikitable"
!  Person 
!  Singular 
!  Plural 
|- 
! 1st 
|  — (e)ɣ
|  n(e) —

|  i/y(e) — 
|  — (e)n
|- 
!  3rd (f)
|  t(e) —

|}

*Example: verb '''afeg''' (to fly) with its four themes : '''ufeg''' (preterite), '''ufig''' (negative preterite), '''afeg''' (aorist), '''ttafeg''' (intensive aorist).

===Verb framing===
Kabyle is a [[Verb framing|satellite-framed]] based language, Kabyle verbs use two particles to show the path of motion:
*''d'' orientates toward the speaker, and could be translated as "here".
*''n'' orientates toward the interlocutor or toward a certain place, and could be translated as "there".

Examples:
* « iru{{unicode|ḥ}}-'''d''' » (he came), « iru{{unicode|ḥ}}-'''n''' » (he went).
* « awi-'''d''' aman» (bring the water), « awi aman » (carry away the water).

===Negation===
Kabyle usually expresses negation in two parts, with the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''ur'' attached to the verb, and one or more negative words that modify the verb or one of its [[argument]]s. For example, simple verbal negation is expressed by « ''ur'' » before the verb and the particle « ''ara'' » after the verb:
*« Urareɣ » ("I played") → « '''Ur''' urareɣ '''ara''' » ("I didn't play") 
Other negative words (acemma...etc.) are used in combination with ''ur'' to express more complex types of negation.

===Verb derivation===
Verb derivation is done by adding suffixes. There are three types of derivation forms : [[Causative]], [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[Passive tense|Passive]].

*'''Causative''': obtained by prefixing the verb with s- / sse- / ssu- :
::ffeɣ "to go out" → ssuffeɣ "to make to go out"
::kcem "to enter" → ssekcem "to make to enter, to introduce"
::irid "to be washed" → ssired "to wash".
*'''Reflexive''': obtained by prefixing the verb with m- / my(e)- / myu-:
::{{unicode|ẓ}}er "to see" → m{{unicode|ẓ}}er "to see each other"
::{{unicode|ṭṭ}}ef "to hold" → myu{{unicode|ṭṭ}}af "to hold each other".
*'''Passive''': is obtained by prefixing the verb with ttu- / ttwa- / tt- / mm(e)- / n- / nn-:
::krez "to plough" → ttwakrez "to be ploughed"
::ečč "to eat" → mmečč "to be eaten".
*'''Complex forms''': obtained by combining two or more of the previous prefixes:
::enɣ "to kill" → mmenɣ "to kill each other" → smenɣ "to make to kill each other"
Interestingly, two prefixes can cancel each other:
::enz "to be sold" → zzenz "to sell"  → ttuzenz "to be sold" (ttuzenz = enz !!).

=== Agent noun ===
Every verb has a corresponding [[agent noun]]. In English it could be translated into verb+er. It is obtained by prefixing the verb with « am- » or with « an- » if the first letter is b / f / m / w (there are exceptions however).

*Examples:
::{{unicode|ṭṭ}}ef "to hold" → ana{{unicode|ṭṭ}}af "holder"
::inig "to travel" → iminig "traveller" 
::eks "to graze" → ameksa "shepherd"

===Action noun===
Every verb has a corresponding [[action noun]], which in English it could be translated into verb+ing:

::ffer "to hide" → tuffra "hiding" (stem VI), « Tuffra n tidett ur telhi » — "Hiding the truth is bad".

There are 6 regular stems of forming action nouns, and the 7th is for quality verbs : (C for consonant, V for vowel)

*Examples:

===Predicative particule "d"===
The predicative particule "d" is an indispensable tool in speaking Kabyle, "d" is equivalent to both "it is + adjective" and "to be + adjective", but cannot be replaced by the verb "ili" (to be). It is always followed by a noun (free state).

Examples:
*D taqcict, "it's a girl".
*D nekk, "it's me".
*Nekk d argaz, "I'm a man".
*Idir d anelmad, "Idir is a student".
*Idir yella d anelmad, "Idir was a student".

The predicative particule "d" should not be confused with the particle of coordination "d"; indeed, the former is followed by a noun at its annexed state while the first is always followed by a noun at its free state.

===Numerotation===
Only the first two numbers are Berber; for higher numbers, [[Arabic]] is used.  They are ''yiwen'' (f. ''yiwet'') "one", ''sin'' (f. ''snat'') "two". The noun being counted follows it in the [[genitive]]: ''sin n yirgazen'' "two men".

"First" and "last" are respectively ''amezwaru'' and ''aneggaru'' (regular adjectives).  Other [[ordinal]]s are formed with the prefix ''wis'' (f. ''tis''): ''wis sin'' "second (m.)", ''tis tlata'' "third (f.)", etc.

===Prepositions===
[[Prepositions]] precede their objects: « ''i medden'' » "to the people", « ''si temdint'' » "from the town".   All words preceded by a preposition (at the exception of « ''s'' » and « ''ar'' », "towards", "until" ) take their annexed state.

Some prepositions have two forms : one is used with pronominal suffixes and the other form is used in all other contexts.

Also some of these prepositions have a corresponding [[relative pronoun]] (or [[interrogative pronoun|interrogative]]), example: 

::« '''i''' » "for/to" → « '''iwumi''' » "to whom" 
::« Tefka aksum '''i''' wemcic » "she gave meat '''to''' the cat" → « Amcic '''iwumi''' tefka aksum » "The cat '''to whom''' she gave meat"

===Conjunctions===

==Vocabulary==
Kabyle has absorbed quite some Arabic and French vocabulary. According to [[Salem Chaker]], about a third of Kabyle vocabulary is of Arabic origin; the amount of French loanwords has not been studied yet. These loanwords are sometimes Berberized and sometimes kept in their original form. The Berberized words follow the regular grammar of Kabyle (free and annexed state).

Examples of berberized Arabic or french words :

:Kitab => Taktabt (Book, Ar.)
:Machine => Tamacint (Machine, Fr.)

Many loanwords from Arabic have often a different meaning in Kabyle:

:El Mal (Money, Ar.) => Lmal (Domestic animals, Kab.)

All verbs of Arabic origin follow a Berber conjugation and verbal derivation: 

:fhem (to understand) => ssefhem (to explain).
