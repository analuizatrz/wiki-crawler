'''Arthur Rose Eldred''' ([[August 16]], [[1895]] &ndash; [[January 4]], [[1951]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] official and executive who, as a teenager, became the first [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) on [[August 21]], [[1912]], just two years after the BSA was founded in 1910. Eldred also received the Bronze Honor Medal for lifesaving, and was the first of three generations of Eagle Scouts.

As an adult, Eldred served in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]] and then worked in the agriculture and produce transportation industries. He was an active [[Scout Leader|Scout leader]] and school board member throughout his life.

==Scouting as a youth==
Eldred was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]] and raised in [[Oceanside, New York|Oceanside]], [[Long Island]], New York by his mother after his father died.  Eldred’s older brother, Hubert W. Eldred, was instrumental in starting Troop 1 of Rockville Centre, Oceanside, Long Island, New York in November 1910.  Troop 1 was fully uniformed and their appearance so impressed [[Chief Scout Executive]] [[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]] that he asked the troop to serve as honor guard for the visit of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], the founder of Scouting. West paid the expenses for the troop to travel to New York on [[January 31]], [[1912]]. Baden-Powell inspected Troop 1, and spoke with Eldred at some length.<ref name="eaglescoutorg">{{cite web | url = http://www.eaglescout.org/history/first_eagle.html | title = BSA's first Eagle Scout | work = Eagle Scout Resource Center | accessdate = 2006-07-07}}</ref><ref name="Troop1historysource">{{cite web | url = http://members.cox.net/scouting179/ScoutHistory.htm | title = Arthur Rose Eldred to Principal of Oceanside Senior High dated Mar 28, 1940  | work = Documents item 3-3 | accessdate = 2007-12-10}}</ref>

In March 1911, Eldred earned First Class rank. In April of 1912, he completed the twenty-one [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badges]] required for Eagle Scout. Merit badges are awards for mastering skills taught in the [[Scouting]] program. At the time, only 141 merit badges had then been earned by about 50 Scouts. As originally implemented, Eagle Scout was part of the merit badge system and was not a rank. Thus Eldred, like several of the early Eagles, did not earn the Life or Star awards that preceded Eagle Scout.<ref>{{cite web | last = Peterson | first = Robert | year = 2002 | url = http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0211/d-wwas.html | title = Evolution of the Eagle Scout Award | work = Scouting  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Eldred | first = Willard G. | year = 2003 | url = http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0305/d-lett.html | title = Wrong Eagle Scout Shown | work = Scouting|publisher = [[Boy Scouts of America]] | accessdate = 2006-07-07}}</ref> Eldred's merit badges were noted in the Honor Roll of the August 1912 edition of ''[[Boys' Life]]''.<ref name="eaglescoutorg" /><ref name="Troop1historysource" />

Eldred did not have a troop [[Board of Review (Boy Scouts of America)|board of review]], a review by  the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a thorough National Board of Review consisting of Chief Scout Executive James E. West, Chief Scout [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], [[Commissioner Service|National Scout Commissioner]] [[Daniel Carter Beard]] and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who had written articles on life-saving and swimming in the ''[[Boy Scout Handbook|Handbook for Boys]]''. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated [[August 21]], [[1912]]. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused by the fact that the design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was awarded Eagle Scout on [[Labor Day]], [[September 2]], [[1912]].

In August 1912, Eldred was camping with the troop in [[Orange Lake, New York]]. While swimming in the lake, Melvin Daly, another Scout who was 15 and a non-swimmer, began to drown.  Eldred rescued Daly with the assistance of Merritt Cutler.  Chief Scout Seton presented Eldred with the Honor Medal for this action.

==Education and career==
Eldred entered [[Cornell University]] in the fall of 1912 to study agriculture, and graduated in 1916. At the university, Eldred was president of the Cornell University Agricultural Association and participated in [[Athletics (track and field)|track]] and [[cross country running|cross-country]].<ref name="eaglescoutorg"/><ref name="Troop1historysource" />

Eldred enlisted in the United States Navy in January 1918, during World War I. He was initially assigned to the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] before shipping out on the transport WSS ''Henderson'' on Sunday, [[June 30]], [[1918]] from Bush Terminal in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]] for overseas duty. On [[June 1]], [[1918]] his convoy spotted two enemy [[submarine]]s and attacked them with depth charges. It is not known whether the submarines were damaged. On [[June 2]], [[1918]] there was a fire onboard the Henderson that resulted in the ship sinking. All but one or two of those onboard were rescued by other ships in the convoy. Eldred was eventually taken aboard the ''[[SS Kronprinz Wilhelm|USS Von Steuben]]'' (ID-3017) and continued to [[Brest, France]], where his knowledge of [[French language|French]] proved useful.<ref name="Eldred1918A">{{cite web | url = http://members.cox.net/scouting179/ScoutHistory.htm | title = Arthur Rose Eldred to his mother, dated Jul 05, 1918 |work = Documents item 3-1|accessdate = 2007-12-10}}</ref> From there, he was  sent by train to [[Italy]].<ref name="Eldred1918B">{{cite web | url = http://members.cox.net/scouting179/ScoutHistory.htm  | title = Arthur Rose Eldred to his mother, dated Jul 23, 1918  | work = Documents item 3-2 | accessdate = 2007-12-10}}</ref><ref name="2006letter">{{cite web | url = http://members.cox.net/scouting179/ScoutHistory.htm | title = Willard G.

Eldred arrived in Italy in July 1918 and eventually at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in [[Corfu]], [[Greece]] in September 1918.  There he served as a machinist aboard  [[submarine chaser]] SC-244, where they patrolled the [[Strait of Otranto]] and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the [[Spanish flu|1918 flu pandemic]]. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the [[United States]] and arrived in [[Malta]] on [[December 25]], [[1918]]. By February 1919, he was in [[Gibraltar]]. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on [[March 4]], [[1919]]. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship.<ref name="WWI">{{cite web | last = Everette | first = Randy | authorlink = | coauthors =|year = [[September 22]], [[2006]] | url = http://members.cox.net/scouting179/ScoutHistory.htm | title = Eldred Interview (b)| format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = 2006-09-22}}</ref> They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat on the way back to America.<ref name="2006letter"/>

After the war, Eldred worked for a [[dairy]], and in 1921 became the agricultural agent for [[Atlantic County, New Jersey]] where he established the [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] municipal market for farm products.  He later promoted produce transportation for the [[Reading Railroad]].  As the trucking industry became a major produce carrier, Eldred became the manager of the Motor Carrier Committee of the Eastern Railroad Association. He also served on the [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County Council]], the Clementon Board of Education, and was president of the Overbrook regional school board.<ref name="eaglescoutorg"/><ref name="Troop1historysource" />

==Adult Scouting life and descendants==

Eldred was a board of review examiner throughout the 1920s. He was later the troop committee chairman for Troop 77&nbsp;in [[Clementon, New Jersey]].  Eldred's descendants have followed in his footsteps. Eldred was present when his eldest son, Willard "Bill" G. Eldred, had his Eagle Scout ceremony on [[October 27]], [[1944]]. Eldred also had a second son and one daughter.<ref name="siblings">{{cite web | last = Everette | first = Randy | authorlink = | coauthors =|year = [[March 20]], [[2007]] | url = http://members.cox.net/scouting179/ScoutHistory.htm | title = Eldred Interview (e) | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> His grandson, Willard Eldred, is also an Eagle Scout.
