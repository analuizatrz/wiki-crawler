The '''lira''' (plural ''lire'') was the [[currency]] of [[Italy]] between 1861 and 1999. Between 1999 and 2002, the Italian lira was officially a “national subunit” of the [[euro]]. However, physical payments could only be made in lira, as no euro coins and notes were available.

The lira was also the currency of the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] between 1807 and 1814.

The term originates from the value of a [[Troy pound]] ([[Latin]] ''libra'') of high purity [[silver]] and as such is a direct cognate of the British pound sterling; in some countries, such as [[Cyprus]], the words ''lira'' and ''[[pound (currency)|pound]]'' are used as equivalents. '''L''', sometimes in a double-crossed script form ('''₤'''), was usually used as the symbol. It was subdivided into 100 ''centesimi'', which translates to "one hundredth".

==History==

The lira ultimately dates back to [[Charlemagne]]. Like the [[pound sterling]], it represented one [[troy pound]] of [[silver]], and was equal to 240 ''denari''. Before unification, many of the Italian states used the lira as their currency.

[[Image:Regno d'Italia - 40 lire 1812.jpg|thumb|left|40 lire coin of the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]].]]

In [[1807]], the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] (occupying the north of the current state) introduced the lira as its currency. Equal to the [[French franc]], it was divided into 20 soldi or 100 centesimi. This lira circulated until [[1814]] when the kingdom was divided up into smaller states.

Upon the creation of the Kingdom of Italy under [[Victor Emmanuel II|Vittorio Emanuele II]] ([[1861]]), a unified lira was established, at 4.5 grams of silver, as part of the [[Latin Monetary Union]]. This was a direct continuation of the [[Sardinian lira]]. Other currencies replaced by the Italian lira included the [[Lombardy-Venetia florin]], the [[Two Sicilies piastra]], the [[Tuscan fiorino]], the [[Papal States scudo]] and the [[Parman lira]].

[[World War I]] broke the Latin Monetary Union, and resulted in prices rising severalfold in Italy.  [[Inflation]] was curbed somewhat by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], who, on [[August 18]], [[1926]], declared that the exchange rate between lira and pound would be £1 = 90 lire, although the free exchange rate had been closer to 140-150 lire per pound.  Inflation once again resurged during [[World War II]], and during the post-War era, several episodes of high inflation continued its erosion, until it was replaced by the Euro. 

Italian lira (500 lire) has been the first modern currency to use [[bi-metallic coins]], with a system patented by [[IPZS]], and also the first to introduce the [[braille]] value on the edge. {{fact}}

The lira was the official unit of currency in [[Italy]] until [[January 1]], [[1999]], when it was replaced by the [[euro]] (euro coins and notes were not introduced until 2002). Old lira denominated currency ceased to be legal tender on [[February 28]] [[2002]]. The conversion rate is 1936.27 lire to the euro.[http://www.ultimalira.it/inglese/storia_lira_compl.html]
All lira banknotes in use immediately before the introduction of the euro, as all post WW2 coins, are still exchangeable for euros in all branches of the Bank of Italy until [[February 28]] [[2012]].
