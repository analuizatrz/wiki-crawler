==Construction==
===Burnham & Root===
The Rookery was built in 1887-1888 by the architectural partnership of [[Daniel H. Burnham]] and [[John Wellborn Root]], known as [[Burnham and Root]]. In the architectural boom that followed the [[Great Chicago Fire]], architects in what would become known as the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]] of commercial architecture competed with each other to create the world's first true skyscrapers. By mixing modern building techniques such as metal framing, fireproofing, elevators and plate glass, together with traditional ones such as brick facades and elaborate ornamentation, Burnham and Root sought to create a bold architectural statement that would nonetheless survive as a commercially successful office building.<ref name=therookery>{{cite book | last=Pridmore | first=Jay | coauthors=Hedrich Blessing |

As the master artisan, Root drew upon a variety of influences in designing the interior and exterior spaces, including Moorish, Byzantine, Venetian and Romanesque motifs.<ref name=therookery/> He also provided the architectural innovations that brought together many contemporary cutting edge building techniques. Of particular note was a "floating" foundation - a reinforced concrete slab that provided the building's weight with a solid platform atop Chicago's notoriously swampy soil.<ref name=therookery/>  The term for the type of foundation that Root designed is [[grillage foundation]], a foundation where iron rails and the structural beams are combined in a crisscross pattern and encased in concrete to support the building's immense weight without heavy foundation stones.<ref name=EMP/>  This construction is particularly useful when structural loads are high compared to the natural bearing capacity of the soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sereneinteriors.com/dictionaries/interior-design-dictionary-g.html|accessdate=2007-05-26|date=2006|publisher=Serene Interiors|title=Dictionary of Interior Designing}}</ref>

[[Image:Rookery_light_court.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Rookery's light court serves as a focal point for the entire building.]]
===Light court===
Young architectural assistant [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was working with [[Dankmar Adler|Adler]] and [[Louis Sullivan|Sullivan]] at the time the Rookery was built in 1886. Architect Daniel Burnham was a friend of Wright patron Edward  C. Waller and Waller managed the Rookery; Wright had his offices in the building in 1898-1899. Thus, it is not surprising that Wright received the commission, in 1905, to redesign the lobby in the building; at the time considered the grandest in Chicago.<ref name=ogorman/> Wright's work on the Rookery recast the entryway in his [[Prairie style]] and added a sense of modernity through his simple but effective lighting design.<ref name=ogorman>O'Gorman, Thomas J. Frank Lloyd Wright's Chicago, Thunder Bay Press, San Diego: 2004, pp.189-193, (ISBN 1592231276).</ref>

Among Wright's most significant alterations was the addition of white [[marble]] with [[Persian architecture|Persian]]-style ornamentation. The marble and decorative details added a sense of luxury to the lobby's [[steel]]-laden interior, teeming with Burnham and Root's skeletal metal ribbing.<ref name=ogorman/> The entire interior space is bright and open. A double set of curving, heavily-ornamented stairs wind upward from the lobby's second floor into the building's interior. A wrap around [[balcony]] on the second floor enhances the feeling of being within the interior of a "[[clockwork]]."<ref name=ogorman/> The Wright remodel opened the building up to more of the available light.<ref name=ogorman/>

Making prodigious use of light and ornamentation, the light court served as the focal point for the entire building. Rising two stories, the light court received immediate critical acclaim. "There is nothing bolder, more original or more inspiring in modern civic architecture than its glass-covered court", wrote Eastern critic Henry Van Brunt.<ref name=therookery/> At a time when Chicago's bold experiment in architecture was looking eastward for affirmation, this was welcome praise.<ref name=therookery/>  The light court provides natural illumination for the interior offices.<ref name=PW/><ref name=PS/> Wright's work on the Rookery is his only work on any building within the downtown cityscape.<ref name=ogorman/>

===Other architectural details===
The red [[marble]], [[terra cotta]] and [[brick]] [[facade]] of the building is a combination of [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Roman Revival]] and [[Queen Anne]] styles that embraced [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] [[architecture]].<ref name=PW/><ref>{{cite web

===Renovations===
While much of the Loop's 19th century architecture has been lost to demolition, the Rookery has been spared this fate through a series of well planned and executed renovations. The building remains a commercially successful rental office building, as it was when it was first built.<ref name=therookery/>

Beginning in the early 20th century, the building underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was retained to remake the interior spaces. In keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved [[Carrara]] marble surfaces. Nearing the peak of his fame, Wright's changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery one of the most sought after buildings in all of Chicago.<ref name=therookery/> Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding planters as well as light fixtures.<ref name=EMP/>

The second renovation, completed [[August 24]] [[1931]] by former Wright assistant William Drummond, modernized many of the interior elements, including new elevators, and brought period touches to the building, such as [[Art Deco]] detailing.<ref name=ogorman/> The third renovation, in 1992, brought the building back much of its original splendor, reopening the light court ceiling after it had been covered over to protect against leaks.<ref name=therookery/>

After their purchase of the Rookery in [[October 2007]] the new owners announced plans for an extensive renovation of the building's common areas.<ref name=Trib_20071027_2_1/>

===Tenants===
Burnham & Root had their offices at the Rookery for a while upon its completion. At one time Wright had an office in the building.<ref name=EMP/> Current tenants include [[US Bank]], [[Brooks Brothers]], [[TVS Partnership/Architects]] and [[BNP Paribas]], among others.<ref name=Trib_20071027_2_1/>

==Current ownership==
The building was purchased in [[October]] [[2007]] for $73 million by an investment group controlled by a European family, and advised by Zeb Bradford of Metzler North America Corp. The seller was Broadway Real Estate Partners of New York, which had bought the Rookery for $56 million in [[April]] [[2006]]. BREP was reported to have increased occupancy of the building's 281,000 sq ft from 80% in [[January]] [[2007]] to 96% at the time of the sale.<ref name=Trib_20071027_2_1>{{Citation |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-sat_rookeryoct27,0,7534515.story|date=October 17, 2007|year=2007|accessdate=2007-11-01|title=Rookery bought by European investors|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|last=Diesenhouse|first=Susan|pages=2.1-2.2}}</ref>

==Cultural references==
The name [[Rookery]] is an allusion to the old city hall building that occupied the land before the Rookery was built.<ref name=EMP/> The building was called the Rookery not only in reference to the [[crow]]s and [[pigeon]]s that inhabited its exterior walls, but also because of the shady politicians it housed.<ref name=therookery/><ref name=EMP/> After the [[Great Chicago Fire]] a dilapidated building was used as an interim [[City Hall]] at this location (LaSalle and Adams). However, pigeons became such a nuisance that a complaining citizen began referring to the building as "a rookery", a term the press quickly adopted. Although several names were considered when a new structure on the site was proposed, "the Rookery" won out.<ref name=PS>{{cite web|url=http://www.patsabin.com/illinois/rookery.htm|accessdate=2007-05-24|title=The Rookery |publisher=Pat Sabin}}</ref>

The Rookery Building was featured in the movie [[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]], where one of the lower levels was modeled as a toy store, [[Duncan's Toy Chest]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.movietourguide.com/Home_Alone_2:_Lost_in_New_York/filming_locations |title=Home Alone 2: Lost in New York Filming Locations |publisher=Movie Locations Guide }}</ref>

The Rookery was also home to fictional financial speculator Curtis Jadwin in ''[[The Pit (novel)|The Pit]]'' by [[Frank Norris]].<ref name=EMP/>
