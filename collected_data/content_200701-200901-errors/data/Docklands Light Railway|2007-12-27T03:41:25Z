The '''Docklands Light Railway''' ('''DLR''') is a [[light rail]] system serving the redeveloped [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area of [[East London, England]]. It extends to [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] in the north, and [[Lewisham]] in the south, west to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], close to the City financial district, and east to the rest of the Docklands, [[London City Airport]], [[Beckton]] and [[Woolwich]]. The DLR has separate track and trains from the [[London Underground]], but the two systems share a ticketing system and the DLR appears on the London Underground’s [[Tube map]]. 
<!--''Note: Although it is not [[Capitalization|grammatically]] correct, TfL nowadays seem to use mixed upper/lower case when referring to the line names on all literature, maps, signs and even labels on some trains. For example, the [[Circle line]] is always listed as Circle '''line''', not Circle '''Line'''. However, this convention does not extend to the [[Docklands Light Railway]].''-->

The trains are computer-controlled and normally have no driver: a Passenger Service Agent (PSA) <ref>{{cite web

PSAs can also take control of the train in certain circumstances including equipment failure and emergencies. Stations are generally unstaffed except the ones below ground, which are required to be staffed in case evacuation is needed.

The DLR has been operated and maintained by a private franchise since 1997. The current franchise, due to expire in April 2013, belongs to Serco Docklands Ltd., a company jointly formed by [[Serco]] and the former DLR management team.

The DLR system is undergoing continuing expansion, with currently 38 stations. In 2006 it carried over 60 million passengers.<ref>Transport for London (2007) [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4825.aspx Docklands Light Railway carries 60 million passengers] Retrieved [[April 5]], [[2007]]</ref> The Docklands Light Railway was 20 years old on [[31 August]] [[2007]] <ref>Transport for London (2007) [http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=144]</ref>.

==History==
=== Before the DLR ===
The decline of the docks east of London began in the early 1960s, as containerised traffic began to move overseas, and the declining UK manufacturing base shipped less and less through the docks.  The opening of the [[Tilbury]] container docks, further east in Essex, sealed the fate of the docks, and in 1980 control of the now almost out-of-use docks passed to the British government.
[[Image:DLR tower gateway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tower Gateway station was the DLR’s original link to central London.]]
The [[Jubilee line]] as opened ([[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore]] to [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]]) in 1979, was supposed to be the first stage in a new cross-town tube line, stretching from Charing Cross, via [[Ludgate Circus]], [[Cannon Street station|Cannon Street]] and [[Wapping tube station|Wapping]], to various sites in South-East London. One option considered was [[Lewisham]] via [[Surrey Quays]], taking over the [[East London line]] at that point; another was [[Thamesmead]] via [[West India Docks]] and [[Royal Docks]].           

Although land had been reserved for the construction of a second section (land at the derelict Ludgate Circus and Lewisham amongst others had been bought by London Transport in anticipation of the go-ahead), the escalating cost of a second-stage Jubilee Line saw the project officially postponed indefinitely in the early 1980s.<ref>LDDC website [http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran1.jpg] Retieved [[April 17]], [[2007]]</ref>

A search for a cheaper way to throw public transport across the docks, in order to stimulate regeneration, saw various plans, but the one investigated most eagerly was a light-rail scheme, exploiting much existing former railway infrastructure, to link the West India Docks to [[Tower Hill]], and a northern terminus, either Stratford running alongside the Great Eastern lines out of London, or a street-running railway to the [[District line|District]] and [[Central line]] station at [[Mile End tube station|Mile End]].  The final decision to invest in a fully automated railway precluded any tram-like ideas, and Stratford was chosen as the northern Terminus, using a bay platform at the far west of the station.  Interchange here was with the Central line and main lines, later the Jubilee line (the regeneration of the docks brought the Jubilee plans full circle &mdash; an extension along the South Bank, via the Surrey Quays/Docks through [[Canary Wharf]] and on to Stratford via the next regeneration "hotspot", the Greenwich peninsula, opened in 1999).

The initial [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]]/[[Stratford station|Stratford]] to [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]] (at the southern end of the [[Isle of Dogs]], next to the [[Thames]] facing [[Greenwich]] (see "extensions" below) was opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1987, the costs having been held down to £77 million &mdash; a relatively low figure considering the state of the art technology employed.

=== Initial system ===
As originally conceived, the system was to be entirely above ground and comprise three branches, with their termini at [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]], [[Stratford station|Stratford]] and [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]]. 

Most of the track was elevated, either on new lightweight concrete viaducts or on disused railway viaducts, with some use of disused surface-level railway right of way. 

The system was lightweight, with stations and trains only a single articulated vehicle long. The three branches together totalled 13 [[Kilometre|km]],<ref name="facts">Docklands Light Railway (2005). ''[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/dlr/about/facts.shtml Facts]'', with 13 stations. Retrieved [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref> were connected by a flat triangular junction near Poplar. Services ran Tower Gateway-Island Gardens and Stratford-Island Gardens, meaning that the north side of the junction was not used in regular passenger service.

The stations on the initial system were mostly to a common design and were constructed out of a standard set of parts.  The principal distinguishing feature of the stations was a relatively short half cylindrical glazed blue canopy to provide shelter from the rain.

===First extensions===
[[Image:Tower Gateway DLR station 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The view from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] looking east shows [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] approach tracks to the left, the original DLR line in the centre, and DLR train emerging from the tunnel to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] to the right]]

The initial system proved to have insufficient capacity as the Docklands area developed into a major financial centre and employment zone. Additionally, the Tower Gateway terminus, situated at the very edge of the [[City of London]], attracted criticism for its poor connections.

In response to this, all stations and trains were extended to two-unit lengths, and the system was extended into the heart of the City of London with a tunnel to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank underground station]], which opened in 1991. This extension diverged from the initial western branch, leaving [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway station]] on a limb. It also rendered the initial car fleet obsolete, as its construction was not suitable for use underground ''(see the [[#Rolling Stock|Rolling Stock]] section, below, and the main article [[Docklands Light Railway rolling stock]])''.

At the same time, the areas in the east of [[London Docklands|Docklands]] needed better transport connections to encourage development. This resulted in a fourth branch being constructed, from [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] via [[Canning Town station|Canning Town transport interchange]] to [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]], running along the north side of the Royal Docks complex. Early designs showed several options through the Blackwall Area [http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran15.jpg]. As part of this extension, one side of the original flat triangular junction was replaced with a [[grade separation|grade-separated]] junction west of Poplar, and a new grade-separated junction was created at the divergence of the Stratford and Beckton lines east of Poplar. Poplar station was rebuilt to provide cross-platform interchange between the Stratford and Beckton lines.

The growth of the [[Canary Wharf]] office complex required the redevelopment of [[Canary Wharf DLR station]] from a small wayside station to a large complex with six platforms serving three tracks, beneath a large overall roof and fully integrated into the malls below the office towers. The original DLR station was never completed and was, in fact, dismantled before the line officially opened.  The trains', automatic operation continued to stop at the location.

===Second stage extensions=== 
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:MG 8236.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Blackwall DLR Station with Canary Wharf in the background]] -->
Early in the days of the DLR's operation, the [[London Borough of Lewisham]] commissioned a feasibility study of extending the DLR under the Thames to Lewisham.  The outcome of the study led the South London borough to push the case for an extension, and eventually a line to [[Greenwich]], [[Deptford]] and Lewisham joined the roster of extensions.

The line was planned to leave the original DLR route south of Crossharbour turn-back sidings, dropping gently to Mudchute, a street level station replacing the high-level Mudchute on the former London & Blackwall viaduct.  Immediately after, the line would drop into tunnel, tracing the route of the viaduct to Island Gardens, a just-below-surface station reached by a staircase.  Crossing the Thames, the line would have a station in the centre of Greenwich, thereafter rising to the surface in deep tunnel and then cut-and-cover to a stop at the mainline [[Greenwich station]], the southbound DLR track offering convenient cross-platform interchange with the city-bound mainline.  From here, the line would snake across concrete viaducts to Deptford, Elverson Road (at street level on a road close to Lewisham town centre), terminating in two platforms lying directly under the mainline platforms at Lewisham, in walking distance of the town shopping centre, and bus services stopping directly outside the station.

The Lewisham extension, authorised as above, opened in 1999. With the opening of the extension, DLR took its first steps from being a local people-mover to a truly important backbone of the east/south-east London transport system.  Further extension to Woolwich, already being shown on London tube maps, and to be built at or close to the future stop on the [[Crossrail]] line to Abbey Wood via West India and Royal Docks, will contribute to this growth. 
<ref name="facts">Map showing new and future extensions to the DLR''[http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/docklands3.html]''Retrieved [[April 17]] [[2007]].</ref>

On [[2 December]] [[2005]], a new eastward branch, running along the southern side of the [[Royal Docks]] complex, opened from Canning Town to [[King George V DLR station|King George V]], via [[London City Airport]].

==Current system== 
[[Image:dlr.canary.wharf.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Docklands Light Railway train enters [[Canary Wharf]] from the south.]]

The DLR now includes routes extending for a total of 31 [[Kilometre|km]].<ref name="facts">Docklands Light Railway (2005). ''[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/dlr/1538.aspx]''. Retrieved [[April 16]], [[2007]].</ref> There are five branches: to [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]] in the south, [[Stratford station|Stratford]] in the north, [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]] and [[King George V DLR station|King George V]] in the east, and to Central London, splitting to serve [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] and [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]]. Although the system allows many different combinations of routes, at present the following four are operated in normal service:

* Stratford to Lewisham
* Bank to Lewisham
* Bank to King George V
* Tower Gateway to Beckton

Trains during peak times on the Stratford line turn back at [[Crossharbour and London Arena DLR station|Crossharbour]] rather than continuing to Lewisham. There are also occasional trains from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] to Crossharbour and [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]]. There are no [[limited-stop]] trains on the DLR: every train serves every station on its route.

The northern and southern branches terminate at the National Rail (main line) stations at Stratford and Lewisham. Other direct interchanges between the DLR and National Rail are at [[Limehouse station|Limehouse]] and Greenwich.

===Stations===
[[Image:DLR Westferry aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|An eastbound train leaving Westferry Station.]]
Many DLR stations are elevated, with others at street level, in a cutting, or underground. Access to the platforms is normally by staircase, very few stations having escalators. Since 2000, all DLR stations have had lifts or ramps, making them accessible by [[wheelchair]]. The stations have high platforms, matching the floor height of the cars, allowing easy access to the trains for passengers with wheelchairs or pushchairs.

Most of the stations are of a modular design dating back to the initial system, albeit extended and improved over the years. This design has two side platforms, each with separate access from the street, and platform canopies with a distinctive rounded roof design. Most stations are unstaffed, although for safety reasons the three stations below ground, [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]], and [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark]], are staffed, as are a few of the busier interchange stations.

See [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations]] for stations on the system.

===DLR Art===
On the [[3 July]] [[2007]], DLR officially launched their own Art Programme similar to that in place on the [[London Underground]], [[Platform for Art]]. Alan Williams has been appointed to produce Docklands Light Railway's first temporary commission. Known as "sidetrack" the project portrays the ordinary and extraordinary sites, often unfamiliar to passengers, along the route of the Docklands Light Railway. [http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=139] [http://www.dlrart.co.uk/]

===Fares and ticketing===
Ticketing is part of the London Underground fare zone system, and [[Travelcard]]s that cover the correct zones are valid. 

There are also one-day and season DLR-only "Rover" tickets available, plus a one-day DLR "Rail and River Rover" ticket for use on the DLR and on City Cruises river boats. Oyster Pre-Pay is also available on the DLR &mdash; passengers need to both touch in and touch out their [[Oyster card]]s on the readers at the entrance / exit to the platforms, or pass through the automatic gates at selected stations.

Tickets must be purchased from ticket machines at the entrance to the platforms, and are required before the passenger enters the platform. There are no ticket barriers in DLR-only stations, and correct ticketing is enforced by on-train checks by the Passenger Service Agent. Exceptions to this rule are [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] and [[Stratford station|Stratford]] stations, where the DLR platforms are located within the barrier lines of a [[London Underground]] or [[National Rail]] station.

The DLR is used by up to a hundred thousand people daily, with around 60 million journeys yearly.[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4825.aspx]

==Accidents and incidents==
===Overrun of station buffers===
Prior to the public opening of the railway, on [[10 March]] [[1987]], a train crashed through station [[buffer stop]]s at the original high-level terminus [[Island Gardens]] station and was left hanging from the end of the elevated track. The accident was caused by unauthorised tests being run before accident-preventing modifications had been installed. The train was being driven manually at the time.<ref name=Risks1>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.29.html#subj3 London Docklands Light Railway; Northern Line's Dot-Matrix Indicators] [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 29 Article 3, [[13 Aug]] 1987</ref><ref name=ModernRailways1>Report on the Docklands Light Railway Accident Which Occurred at Island Gardens Station on [[10 March]] [[1987]], ''[[Modern Railways]]'', May 1987</ref><ref name=ModernRailways2>"'Unauthorised Tests' Caused DLR Crash", ''[[Modern Railways]]'', June 1987</ref>

===Service difficulties with the Royal train===
In July 1987, a series of minor incidents marred the operation of the royal train (number E2R) carrying [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as part of the ceremonies marking the opening of the line.  The train had been manually dispatched from its starting point at Island Gardens station five minutes early because of the early arrival of the royal party.  The train was on automatic control and so, being ahead of schedule, was held at the next station (Mudchute) for a few minutes before the driver reverted to manual control "to speed the Royal passage" and continued on to Poplar station, where the royal party were to disembark.  At the station, a member of the royal security detail used the emergency exit to leave the train ahead of the Queen before it had fully stopped.  This caused the train to make an emergency stop in the station, short of its normal position and out of range of the docking beacon that marked its arrival point. The train doors would not open, impeding the Queen's exit for several minutes.<ref name=Risks2>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.23.html#subj4.1 Railway automation], Stephen Colwill, [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 23 Article 4, [[31 Jul]] 1987</ref><ref name=Risks3>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.52.html#subj2.1 Computer's Normal Operation Delays Royal Visit], Mark Brader, [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 52 Article 2, [[29 Oct]] 1987</ref><ref name=ModernRailways3>"Opening of the Docklands Light Railway," Roger Ford, ''[[Modern Railways]]'', September 1987</ref>

===Collision at West India Quay bridge===
On [[22 April]] [[1991]], two trains collided at a junction on the [[West India Quay]] bridge during morning [[rush hour]], requiring a shutdown of the entire system and evacuation of the involved passengers by ladder.<ref name=Risks5>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/11.52.html#subj1.1 Another commuter train wreck in London], Jonathan I.

===South Quay bombing===
{{Main|1996 Docklands bombing}} 
The Docklands Light Railway has also been the scene of a terrorist attack. On [[9 February]] [[1996]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] exploded a [[lorry]] under a bridge near [[South Quay DLR station]], killing 2 people and injuring many others. This number would have been higher if not for advance warning. The blast did £85 million damage and marked an end to the IRA ceasefire.

==Rolling stock==
[[Image:Dlr emu at tower gateway.jpg|thumb|left|A DLR train is headed by B2K stock car 96, shown at [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway station]]]]

{{Main|Docklands Light Railway rolling stock}}

The DLR is operated by high-floor, bi-directional, single-articulated cars with four doors on each side, each train consisting of two cars. The cars have no driver’s cab, although there is a small driver’s console concealed behind a locked panel at each car end from which the PSA can drive the car when necessary. Other consoles at each door opening allow the PSA to control door closure and make announcements whilst patrolling the train. Because of the absence of a driver’s position, the fully-glazed car ends provide an unusual forward (or rear) view for passengers. The current stock has a top speed of 50 mph (80 km/hour).

Despite having high floors and being highly automated, the cars are derived from a [[Germany|German]] [[light rail|light-rail]] design intended for use in systems with elements of street running. All the cars that have operated on the system to date look similar, but there have been several different types, some still in service and others sold to other operators. A further car type, with quite different styling, is to be introduced in 2007.

{{Template:DLR Route diagram}}
==Signalling technology==
Originally, the DLR used [[Railway signalling|signalling]] based on a [[Railway signalling#Fixed block|fixed-block]] technology developed by GEC-General Signal and [[General Railway Signal]]<ref>Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook, Stephen Jolly and Bob Bayman (1986) ISBN 0 904711 80 3</ref>. This was replaced in 1994 with a [[Railway signalling#Moving block|moving-block]] system developed by [[Alcatel]], called [[SelTrac]]. The same technology is used for some other [[rapid transit]] systems, including Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], San Francisco's Municipal Railway ([[MUNI]]) and [[Hong Kong]]'s MTR. Transmissions occur between each train's onboard computer and the control centre at Poplar. If this link is broken, the train stops until it is authorised to move again. If the whole system fails the train can run at only 20 km/h for safety until the system is restored. Also, emergency brakes can be applied if the train breaks the speed limit during manual control, or if the train leaves the station when the route has not been set.<ref> Railway Technology (2006) [http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/ Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Extensions, London, United Kingdom] Retrieved [[23 November]] [[2006]] </ref>

==Recent developments==

===New platforms at Stratford===
:'''''Status''' - both platforms have opened''
[[Image:Stratford_DLR_4a_4b_e.JPG|thumb|left|New platforms 4a and 4b at Stratford]]
The DLR had only one narrow platform at [[Stratford station|Stratford]]. This limited capacity and hindered interchange with other services at this station and so two replacement platforms have been built. The last day of use of the old platform was [[15 June]] [[2007]] and the first new one opened on Monday [[18 June]] [[2007]]<ref>
[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/5317.aspx Press release on opening first new platform at Stratford]</ref> and the second opened on [[9 December]] [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/6816.aspx New Docklands Light Railway station opens at Langdon Park]</ref>

===Langdon Park station===
:'''''Status''' - Opened''<ref> [http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/langdonpark/details.asp?id=29 Construction begins]</ref>

A station at [[Langdon Park DLR station|Langdon Park]] between [[All Saints DLR station|All Saints]] and [[Devons Road DLR station|Devons Road]] has been completed. Work started on [[17 November]] [[2006]] and it opened on [[9 December]], [[2007]]. The construction work meant that the services between Poplar and Stratford were sometimes suspended at weekends.

==Future developments==
{{future uk public transportation|docklands}}
With the development of the eastern Docklands as part of the ‘[[Thames Gateway]]’ initiative and London’s successful bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], several extensions and enhancements are under construction, being planned or being discussed:<ref name="dlrdev">Docklands Light Railway (2005). ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/index.asp DLR Development Projects]'' Retrieved [[February 23]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Woolwich Arsenal extension===
:'''''Status''' - Under Construction''

An extension of the [[London City Airport]] branch from [[King George V DLR station|King George V]] to [[Woolwich Arsenal railway station|Woolwich Arsenal]] is under construction. This requires a second DLR tunnel crossing of the [[River Thames]]. The projected cost of £150 million is being met by [[Private Finance Initiative]] funding. Construction began in June 2005 and is due to be completed in February 2009.<ref>[http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/latest_news/details.asp?id=108 Mayor launches tunnelling of DLR Woolwich Arsenal Extension]'' Retrieved [[April 28]] [[2006]].</ref> 

On [[23 July]] [[2007]], it was confirmed that both tunnels had been completed.<ref>[http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=141 Tunnel extending Docklands Light Railway to Woolwich completed] </ref>

===Upgrading Bank - Lewisham route to 3-car trains===
:'''''Status''' - Contract let''

The stations between [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank station]] and [[Lewisham station]] will be upgraded to allow operation of 3-car trains to increase capacity. More frequent trains were considered as an alternative, but it was found that the necessary signalling changes would be as expensive as upgrading to handle longer trains but would provide fewer benefits.<ref name="dlrcapen">Docklands Light Railway. (2005). ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/dlr_capacity/index.shtml DLR Capacity Enhancement]''. Retrieved [[February 26]], [[2006]].</ref> 

It is expected that the work will be carried out during 2007-2009; the awarding of the £200m contract was confirmed on 3 May 2007 <ref>[http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=133 Extra carriage on every DLR train]</ref>. The work involves the lengthening of platforms on most stations (except [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]]), together with viaduct-strengthening works. Most of this section dates from the initial system originally built for single-car operation. [[South Quay DLR station|South Quay station]] will have to be moved as nearby curves preclude lengthening. Due to the cost and the risk to nearby historic buildings, the underground [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark station]] will not be extended.  Instead, use of [[Selective Door Operation]] (SDO) has been approved by the [[Railway Inspectorate]] at this station.

====Other stations affected====
Although not on the Bank – Lewisham route, two other stations are included in the plans so as to improve operational flexibility. [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar station]] has already been lengthened in advance of the work elsewhere to confirm that the proposed method of construction is satisfactory. [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] is due to be converted from its current two-track terminal layout into a single longer platform. However the exact details of the Tower Gateway work are under review.<ref name="mrmarch">Ian Allan Publishing. ''Modern Railways''. March 2006''.</ref>

===Stratford International extension / North London Line conversion===
:'''''Status''' - Main construction contract let <ref>
[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/extensions/stratford/details.asp?id=38 DLR on track for Stratford International as £67m contract awarded]</ref>''

On [[October 25]] [[2006]], permission was granted<ref name="siedlr">Docklands Light Railway. ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/extensions/stratford/details.asp?id=28 'Stratford International extension approved' article]''. Retrieved [[October 25]] [[2006]].</ref> for this extension from Canning Town to the new [[Stratford International station]], taking over the [[North London Line]] infrastructure (which closed on [[December 9]] [[2006]]) and linking the Docklands area with domestic and international high-speed services on [[High Speed 1]].

Four new stations will be built: [[Star Lane DLR station|Star Lane]] (formerly known as Cody Road), [[Abbey Road DLR station|Abbey Road]], [[Stratford High Street DLR station|Stratford High Street]] (formerly known as Stratford Market) and Stratford International. The branch will also serve [[London Underground]] and [[National Rail]] stations at [[West Ham]] and [[Stratford, London|Stratford]].  All stations will be able to accommodate 3-car trains. The North London Line will terminate at Stratford in new platforms.

As part of the [[Transport and Works Act 1992|Transport & Works Act]] (TWA) application, the DLR station at Royal Victoria on the Beckton branch will be extended to accommodate 3-car trains.  It will have a third platform, which becomes possible because the part of the abandoned section of [[North London Line]] ran parallel to Royal Victoria station.<ref name="rvdsplan">Docklands Light Railway. ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/pdf/twa_documents/planningdirection/037.pdf Map showing proposed Royal Victoria station]''. Retrieved [[February 26]], [[2006]].</ref>

The first contract for construction work was awarded on [[10 January]] [[2007]]<ref> [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/press-centre/press-releases/press-releases-content.asp?prID=1038 Major contract award signals start of work on DLR Stratford International Extension]</ref> and construction work is expected to start in mid 2007. The announcement of the award of the main construction contract was made in early July 2007. The extension is projected to open early in 2010 and is an important part of the transport improvement package for the [[2012 Olympic Games]], which will largely be held on a site adjoining Stratford International.

===Upgrading other lines to 3-car trains===
:'''''Status''' - Transport & Works Act approval given <ref>[http://www.transportbriefing.co.uk/story.php?id=4238 Transport Briefing DLR platform extensions secure T&W Act approval]</ref>

When the work to allow 3-car trains between [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] and [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]] is complete, the only parts of the network unable to handle longer trains will be between [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] and [[Stratford station|Stratford]], and between Poplar and [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]]. There is therefore a proposal to upgrade the remainder of the line, with the aim of carrying out the work between 2008 and 2010.  As part of this, it is proposed to improve the junction north of [[West India Quay DLR station|West India Quay]], which would preclude services on the Bank to Lewisham route from stopping at West India Quay. This would also allow services from [[Beckton]] and [[Woolwich]] to terminate at [[Canary Wharf]] or [[Lewisham]].

Although approval for the required work was given on [[24 July]] [[2007]], on [[31 July]] [[2007]] TfL stated that the Beckton branch would not be upgraded at the moment, due to a lack of funding <ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/5628.aspx Docklands Light Railway to increase capacity by 50 per cent with three-car trains]</ref>.

===Dagenham Dock extension===
:'''''Status''' - In consultation phase, route safeguarded'' - 2016

This is a proposed extension from Gallions Reach to Dagenham Dock via the riverside at Barking. This would connect the Barking Reach area, a formerly industrial area now undergoing major redevelopment as part of the [[London Riverside]], with the Docklands. This new route would cover major developments at Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Dock Opportunity Area, and five stations have been planned at Beckton Riverside, Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Vale and [[Dagenham Dock railway station|Dagenham Dock]]. The extension is key if [[English Partnerships]]' plan is to work. As shown in DLR's first consultation leaflet <ref>DLR Barking Riverside consultation document [http://developments.dlr.co.uk/pdf/extensions/dagenham/dagenham_consultation_leaflet2.pdf]</ref>, there are plans for the DLR to extend further than [[Dagenham Dock]], possibly to [[Dagenham Heathway]] or [[Rainham railway station|Rainham]].

In the consultation document the proposed timetable suggests work commencing in 2011 and an opening date of 2016. Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] was keen to have the extension open before the [[2012 Olympic Games]]. However, the consultation on the route only began in January 2007 and as the demand for construction work leading up to the games will be considerable, it is unlikely that major work will begin on this until after the games.

DLR recently started the second phase of Consultation.[http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=138]

===Thames Wharf station===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

This station had been included as potential future development on the '''London City Airport extension''' since it was first planned. It would be between [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] and [[West Silvertown DLR station|West Silvertown]], due west of the western end of [[Royal Victoria Dock]]. Since the station's intended purpose is to serve the surrounding area (currently a mix of [[brownfield]] and run-down industrial sites) when it is regenerated, the development is indefinitely on hold due to the area being safeguarded for the [[Silvertown Link]], a new Thames river crossing proposed for opening by 2015.<ref name="atoproj41">AlwaysTouchOut.com (2005). ''[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/41 Silvertown Link]'' Retrieved [[February 24]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Connaught Road / Silvertown Interchange station===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

A site near to [[London City Airport]] has been identified as a possible additional station on the London City Airport extension. It would be a possible interchange with [[Crossrail]], between [[London City Airport DLR station|London City Airport]] and [[Pontoon Dock DLR station|Pontoon Dock]]. However, no plans have emerged as to when this station is to be planned and built. The original extension was designed to allow a station to be built here. It may be located south of the Connaught Crossing.<ref name="atoproj9">AlwaysTouchOut.com (2006). ''[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/9 DLR to City Airport]''. Retrieved [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Charing Cross extension===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed'' - 2026

In February 2006 a proposal to extend the DLR to [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross station]] from [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] DLR branch was revealed.<ref name="mrmarch">Ian Allan Publishing. ''Modern Railways''. March 2006''.</ref> The idea, originating from a DLR "Horizon Study", is at a very early stage at the moment, but would involve extending the line from Bank in bored tunnels under Central London to the Charing Cross [[Jubilee Line|Jubilee line]] platforms, which would be brought back to public use.  These platforms are now on a spur off the current Jubilee line and are not used by passenger trains.

While not confirmed it is probable that the scheme would also use the existing overrun tunnels between the Charing Cross Jubilee platforms and a location slightly to the west of [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych]]. These tunnels were intended to be incorporated into the abandoned Phase 2 of the ''Fleet Line'' (Phase 1 became the original Jubilee Line, prior to the Jubilee Line Extension). However they would need some enlargement because DLR [[loading gauge|gauge]] is larger than tube gauge and current safety regulations would require an emergency walkway to be provided in the tunnel.

The two reasons driving the proposal are capacity problems at Bank, having basically one interchange between the DLR and the central portion of [[London Underground|Underground]], and the difficult journeys faced by passengers from [[Kent]] and South Coast between their rail termini and the DLR. Intermediate stations would be at [[City Thameslink]] and [[Aldwych]], for future connection with the [[Cross River Tram]].

===Euston/King's Cross extension===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed'' {{fact|date=December 2007}}

During the last Horizon study, a possible extension was considered from Bank towards [[Euston railway station|Euston]] or [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]]. The main benefit of this extension will be tapping into an area that doesn't have a direct link to the Canary Wharf site, either existing or proposed. This would create a new artery in central London and help relieve the Northern and Circle lines. There are no official plans for possible stations expect towards [[Farringdon station|Farringdon]], possibly using some of the [[Thameslink Programme|soon-to-be-disused]] [[Thameslink]] infrastructure.

===Works contingent on Crossrail===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

If [[Crossrail]] is approved some of the track between Bow Church and Stratford would need to be moved to the south.  The opportunity would then be taken to double the track throughout and eliminate the only significant section of single track on the system.<ref name="mrmarch">Ian Allan Publishing. ''Modern Railways''. March 2006''.</ref>

The current route projections for the cross-London Crossrail Line 1 entail interchanges with the DLR at Custom House, Stratford, and the provision for interchanges at West India Quay (with Crossrail Isle of Dogs station) and London City Airport (with Crossrail Silvertown station). Another option would be to provide an interchange with a possible new station on the DLR (see ''Connaught Road/Silvertown Interchange station'' section above).<ref name="atoproj1">AlwaysTouchOut.com (2006). ''[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/1#Benchmark Crossrail]''. Retrieved [[February 23]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Lewisham to Catford extension===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed'' - 2026

This extension was looked at during the latest Horizon Study. The route would follow the [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] line and terminate between [[Catford railway station|Catford station]] and [[Catford Bridge railway station|Catford Bridge station]]. However early plans showed problems due to Lewisham DLR station being only marginally higher than the busy A20 road which impedes any proposed extension. The plan is however being revised.<ref>Always Touch Out [http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/129 DLR to Catford]</ref> When the Lewisham extension was first completed there were proposals to continue further to [[Beckenham]] to link it up with the [[Tramlink]] system. However, the way in which Lewisham DLR was built impeded this possible extension and would prove costly to redevelop.
