'''''A Ghost Is Born''''' is the fifth studio [[album]] by [[Chicago]]-based [[alternative rock]] band [[Wilco]]. Released on [[June 22]], [[2004]], it is the only Wilco album that features singer [[Jeff Tweedy]] on lead guitar. The band streamed the album online for free, and offered a five song [[extended play]] to purchasers.

Tweedy entered a rehab clinic shortly before the release of the album, delaying its release by two weeks. It also shortened its promotional tour. Despite this, ''A Ghost Is Born'''s opening week was the best sales week for the band at the time and the album was met with good reviews from major publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[PopMatters]]. The album earned Wilco their first two [[Grammy Awards]], including one for [[Best Alternative Music Album]].

==Production==
[[Wilco]] signed a contract with [[Nonesuch Records]] in November 2001 after a lengthy dispute with [[Reprise Records]] over the release of the band's fourth album ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]''.<ref>For an overview of the controversy, see Kot 2004. p. 201-228</ref> ''Foxtrot'' was welcomed with positive reviews from ''[[The Village Voice]]''—where the album was rated by the critics as the best album of 2002—and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/pazznjop/02/|title=Pazz & Jop 2002|publisher=''[[The Village Voice]]''}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Fricke|first=David|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/322307/yankee_hotel_foxtrot|title=Yankee Hotel Foxtrot: Review|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|date=May 9, 2002}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref> It sold over 590,000 copies, earning a Gold certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref name="Cohen">{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/feature/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571465|title=Wilco: In the Comfort Zone|publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|date=April 13, 2007}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=Gold and Platinum Database Search|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref>

===Composition===
Recording for a new album began in November 2003 under the working title ''Wilco Happens''. The album was produced by [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]], who mixed ''Foxtrot'' and was a member of Wilco side project [[Loose Fur]]. O'Rourke encouraged lead singer [[Jeff Tweedy]] to develop his [[guitar]] skills for the album--Tweedy recently became the lead guitarist for the band due to the dismissal of [[Jay Bennett]] during the ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' recording sessions.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 240</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Barston|first=Steve|title=Pillar of Alt|publisher=''[[Guitar World]] Acoustic''|date=September 2004}}</ref> Tweedy sought to play solos on the album that were unlike those of [[jam bands]] such as [[Phish]] and [[The Grateful Dead]]. Instead, he performed composed solos influenced by [[Television (band)|Television]] such as the one during the [[coda (music)|coda]] of "At Least That's What You Said".<ref name="Kot"/> Tweedy refers to the guitar solo at the end of the track as a "musical transcription" of one of his [[panic attacks]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Mulvey|first=John|title=The Addict|publisher=''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''|date=January 2006}}</ref> ''A Ghost Is Born'' was recorded in a different manner than ''Foxtrot'' or 1999's ''[[Summerteeth]]''; whereas those recordings were performed live in the studio and then overdubbed, ''A Ghost Is Born'' was first performed on [[Pro Tools]] and only played live once completed. Tweedy was excited about writing an album this way:<ref name="Kot">Kot 2004. p. 241</ref>

{{cquote|All those things you can do with Pro Tools and all the emotional buttons you can push with just purely sonic things I think can be done with just plain old music. I love all the possibilities that modern recording techniques allow, but I couldn't picture the idea of really wowing anyone with some crazy evolution of the ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' sound}}

An unusual feature of ''A Ghost Is Born'' is the fifteen-minute long track "Less Than You Think". For the song, each band member created a synthesizer noise that mimicked an electronic sound. The installations were simultaneously activated in the room and recorded. The noise, which served as the coda to the song, was remixed to provide [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] to the track. Calling it "the track that everyone will hate," Tweedy defended the song's inclusion on the album:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 242</ref>

{{cquote|I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say its a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great … I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it.}}

''A Ghost Is Born'' was the first Wilco album with multi-instrumentalist [[Mikael Jorgensen]]; he had previously worked as an engineer with the band on [[Down with Wilco|their collaboration]] with [[The Minus 5]]. Jeff Tweedy provided lead vocals and acted as lead guitarist for the only time since the band formed. John Stirratt, the only original member aside from Tweedy, played [[bass guitar|bass]] and guitar. [[Glenn Kotche]] and Jim O'Rourke, Tweedy's associates from Loose Fur, acted as drummer and multi-instrumentalist, respectively. [[Leroy Bach]] played a variety of keyboards as well as bass guitar. All members of the band contributed with a synthesizer part on "Less Than You Think".<ref>''A Ghost Is Born'' album notes, [[June 22]], [[2004]]. [[Nonesuch Records]], 79809.</ref>

==Marketing and promotion==
Wilco began touring in support of ''Ghost'' even before the album had been released. [[Multi-instrumentalist]] [[Leroy Bach]] left the band after the recording sessions to join a theater production, so Wilco added [[jazz rock]] guitarist [[Nels Cline]] and multi-instrumentalist [[Pat Sansone]] to replace him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pouncey|first=Edwin|title=Free the Spirit|publisher=''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]''|date=August 2004}}</ref><ref>Kot 2004. p. 243</ref> Sansone had been playing with [[The Autumn Defense]], a side project led by bassist [[John Stirratt]]. However, the tour to support the album had to be abridged. In May 2004, Tweedy checked himself into a [[rehabilitation]] clinic in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] due to chronic [[migraine]] headaches, anxiety attacks, and [[clinical depression]]. In the process of treating the ailments, Tweedy had acquired an [[addiction]] to prescription painkillers. His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album's release date. Intended for release on [[June 8]], [[2004]], the album was officially released on [[June 22]], [[2004]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 244</ref>

The band also webcast the album in its entirety on the [[Internet]] in a promotion with [[Apple Computers]]. Nonesuch was willing to allow the [[MPEG-4]] broadcast due to the success of a similar broadcast in the promotion of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot''. Additionally, Wilco offered a free [[extended play]] to purchasers of the album. The EP featured two outtakes from the album—"Panthers" and "Kicking Television"—and live versions of "At Least That's What You Said", "The Late Greats", and "Handshake Drugs". The EP was later packaged with the album and sold as a "deluxe version".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jardin|first=Xeni|url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/11/65688|title="Music Is Not a Loaf of Bread"|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''|date=[[November 15]], [[2004]]}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref>

==Reception==
In its debut week, ''A Ghost Is Born'' peaked at number eight on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and sold over 81,000 copies—the highest U.S. chart peak and best sales week ever attained by the band at that time.<ref>{{cite news|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|publisher=''Billboard''|date=[[July 10]], [[2004]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Whitmire|first=Margo|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000556892|title=Jadakiss Cruises To No. 1 Debut|publisher=''Billboard''|date=[[June 30]], [[2004]]}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref> As of [[April 13]], [[2007]] the album has sold over 340,000 copies according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].<ref name="Cohen"/> The album was an international hit as well, peaking at number twenty-four in [[Norway]], number twenty-nine in [[Sweden]], number thirty-three in [[New Zealand]], number thirty-four in [[Belgium]], and number thirty-seven in [[Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acharts.us/album/13436|title=Wilco - A Ghost Is Born - Music Charts|publisher=acharts.com}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref>

Like ''Foxtrot'', ''A Ghost Is Born'' was well received by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/wilco/ghostisborn?q=wilco|title=Wilco: ''a ghost is born'' (2004)|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref> John Parales of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the album "as eerie as anything Wilco have recorded yet" and applauded "Tweedy offers illuminating curiosity about what can happen in a song."<ref>{{cite news|last=Parales|first=John|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/6187605/review/6194215/a_ghost_is_born|title=A Ghost Is Born (review)|publisher=''Rolling Stone''|date=July 8, 2004}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref> ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' gave it an "A" grade, named it "album of the week", and claimed it was "even more brilliant" than ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gottlieb|first=Akiva|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/review.php?ID=2092&PHPSESSID=994b5a7a24b96839c00d207005a3312a|title=A Ghost Is Born (review)|publisher=''[[Stylus Magazine]]''}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref> Michael Metevier of [[PopMatters]] also supported the notion that ''Ghost'' was better than ''Foxtrot'', calling every note "purposeful" and said that the album made him "surprised and delighted enough to last several lifetimes."<ref>{{cite web|last=Metevier|first=Michael|url=http://popmatters.com/music/reviews/w/wilco-ghost.shtml|title=A Ghost Is Born (review)|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=[[May 21]], [[2004]]}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref> In 2005, ''A Ghost Is Born'' won two [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Best Alternative Music Album]] and [[Best Recording Package]]. Although the band was nominated for Grammys for work on previous albums, this was the first time that they won one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/14/in_depth_showbiz/main673822.shtml|title=2005 Grammy Award Winners|publisher=[[CBS]] Online|date=[[February 13]], [[2005]]}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref>

Not all publications shared these views about the album. [[Pitchfork Media]], who had given ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' a perfect 10 rating, only gave ''Ghost'' a 6.6, calling it "wildly uneven" and "less cohesive than any other Wilco release."<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchum|first=Rob|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/23181-a-ghost-is-born?artist_title=23181-a-ghost-is-born|title=A Ghost Is Born (review)|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=[[June 22]], [[2004]]}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref> [[Robert Christgau]], one of the few detractors of ''Foxtrot'', called the album a "privileged self-indulgence" due to its extreme musical dynamics.<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0426,christgau,54659,22.html|title=Squirt You|publisher=''The Village Voice''|date=[[June 28]], [[2004]]}} Last accessed [[July 27]], [[2007]].</ref>
