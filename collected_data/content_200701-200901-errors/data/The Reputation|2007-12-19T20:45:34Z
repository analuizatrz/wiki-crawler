'''The Reputation''' were an [[indie rock]] band from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The band was fronted by former [[Sarge (band)|Sarge]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Elizabeth Elmore]], with other positions filled by various members.

The band, which formed while Elmore was attending [[law school]], released two albums between the years of 2001 and 2006, both of which were met with generally positive reviews. The band has toured the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==
Following the disbanding of her old band, [[Sarge (band)|Sarge]], Elmore enrolled in law school at [[Northwestern University]].<ref name=AversionSchild>Schild, Matt. "[http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?f_id=152 Making a New Reputation]" Aversion.com, [[11 May]] [[2007]]. Retrieved on [[27 August]] [[2007]].</ref> She embarked on a series of solo tours between classes, but after growing tired of performing solo Elmore recruited ex-Sarge drummer Russ Horvath and ex-Chisel bassist and law school classmate Chris Norborg to tour with. The group toured together and recorded a five song [[demo (music)|demo]], but after a while Horvath and Norborg were no longer able to tour due to schooling. Elmore recruited friend and ex-Moreno guitarist Sean Hulet, ex-Moreno drummer Scott Rosenquist, and ex-Andiamo bassist Joel Root. The new group completed a tour of the East Coast.<ref name=AversionSchild/>

Elmore requested a [[leave of absence]] from Northwestern Law School in 2001 to focus on the band. After ex-Nymb drummer Ben Kane replaced the unavailable Rosenquist, the group signed to [[Initial Records]]. Kane left the band, and former Sarge drummer Chad Romanski joined the group after several weeks of Elmore begging. The band completed a fall West Coast tour and began recording their debut album with Romanski.<ref name="RepOffBio">"[http://www.reputationmusic.com/reputation.html Band Bio]". reputationmusic.com. Retrieved on [[27 August]] [[2007]].</ref> The band took on the name The Reputation at this time, a reference, according to Elmore, intended to be a "personal little 'fuck you'" aimed at certain members within the indie music scene who promoted "endless speculation" about Elmore's sex life.<ref>Draper, Jimmy.

===Self-titled debut===

''The Reputation'', the band's self-titled debut album, was released in 2002 after the band spent much of the fall and winter of 2001 in the recording studio.<ref name=RepOffBio/> The majority of the album was recorded in Chicago at Atlas, with the exception of a cover of [[Elvis Costello]]'s song "Almost Blue," which was recorded with then-[[Wilco]] guitarist [[Jay Bennett]] on piano and production duties, as well as extra arrangements and recording on other tracks.<ref name=STLiners>''The Reputation'' liner notes.</ref>  Elmore, as she did with her work in Sarge, wrote all of the original songs and lyrics, and assisted with the production along with Matt Allison.<ref name=STLiners/>

The album was well received critically. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the album 3.5 out of 4 stars, with reviewer Kevin Bronson saying that "[Elmore's] streaming anecdotes give the listener the feeling of walking right into the middle of life-altering events."<ref>Bronson, Kevin. "[http://www.reputationmusic.com/reputation-latimes.html If This Rock Star Thing Fails, There's Always Law School]". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[17 March]] [[2002]]. Retrieved on [[27 August]] [[2007]].</ref> The ''[[College Music Journal]]'''s Amy Wan called the album a "showcase for Elmore's powerfully biting lyrics and her passionate voice, dancing deftly between little-girl sweet and outright roar,"<ref>Wan, Amy. "[http://prod1.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=33962 REPUTATION: The Reputation]". ''[[College Music Journal]]''. Retrieved on [[27 August]], [[2007]].</ref> and The ''[[Village Voice]]'' gave the album an A-, with famed [[music journalist]] [[Robert Christgau]] praising the debut, saying that "Elmore left a great band to go to law school.

''[[Village Voice]]'', [[20 April]] [[2002]]. Retrieved on [[27 August]] [[2007]].</ref>

Along with the positive feedback for the album, the band was able to secure its first permanent drummer in Matt Espy.<ref name=RepOffBio/>  The band would tour the [[United States]] and parts of [[Canada]] a number of times following the release of the album.<ref name=RepTourDates>"[http://www.reputationmusic.com/past_dates.html Past tour dates]". reputationmusic.com. Retrieved on [[28 August]] [[2007]].</ref>  Along with the performance agenda in 2003, Elmore balanced touring, songwriting for their next album, and a return to law school while the band suffered the loss of yet another drummer, as Espy was forced to leave after a tenure of nearly a year and a half for personal reasons.<ref name=RepOffBio/>

===''To Force a Fate''===

The band settled on their second permanent drummer, Steve Van Horn, shortly after Espy left following their round of touring. At the same time, the band began negotiations with [[Lookout! Records]] to release their follow-up. After a marathon run of shows and songwriting toward the end of 2003, the band recorded their second album.<ref name=RepOffBio/>  The sessions were difficult, with 14 hour recording days being balanced with Elmore attempting to finish remaining law school papers, combined with weekend tour jaunts to the East Coast.<ref>Bowker, Tom. "[http://www.reputationmusic.com/reputation.html SOUND CHECK / Above the law]". ''[[Miami Herald]]''. Retrieved on [[2 September]] [[2007]].</ref> The album was unique compared to other Elmore projects in that other members of the band assisted in the songwriting process.<ref>''To Force a Fate'' liner notes.</ref>

''To Force a Fate'' was ultimately released in April 2004 on Lookout! Records.<ref>"[http://lookout.littletype.com/group-detail.php?item_group_id=4078 Reputation - to force a fate]". Lookout! Records. Retrieved on [[27 August]] [[2007]].</ref> The album received generally positive press, including favorable reviews in ''[[Spin Magazine]]'', calling the album "a bang of [[power-pop]] epiphany."<ref name="press">"[http://www.reputationmusic.com/reputation.html Press]". reputationmusic.com. Retrieved on [[2 September]] [[2007]].</ref> ''[[Blender Magazine]]'' gave the album four stars, stating that "Elizabeth Elmore, a law-school graduate with boy trouble to match her student loans, writes songs that are as much legal briefs as diary entries."<ref>Catucci, Nick. "[http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2059 The Reputation: ''To Force A Fate'']". ''Blender''. Retrieved on [[2 September]] [[2007]].</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the album "muscular yet lush," and gave the album a B+.<ref name="press" /> The album would eventually reach #58 on the CMJ charts.<ref name=RepOffBio/>

===Post-album touring===
The band spent 2004 and 2005 touring the United States for over nine months, including opening slots for [[Ted Leo and the Pharmacists]] and [[Grammy]] nominees [[The Killers (band)|The Killers]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[Death Cab for Cutie]], and [[the Donnas]].<ref name=RepTourDates/> The band's performance at [[South by Southwest]] in particular was covered positively in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]].''<ref>"[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,604995,00.html It's gettin' hot at South by Southwest]". ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[2 April]] [[2004]]. Retrieved on [[27 August]] [[2007]].</ref>

2005 took the band overseas to tour the [[United Kingdom]] for the first time, as well as two separate two-month United States tours. In June of 2005, bassist Joel Root left the band for personal reasons. They completed their summer tour with Stereo South bassist Greg Mytych,<ref name=RepTourDates/> and planned to record a new album in 2006, but came to a halt due to mitigating factors, including the issues with Lookout! Records.<ref>"[http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=4772 Green Day Departure Hobbles Lookout]". Aversion.com, [[2 August]] [[2005]]. Retrieved on [[27 August]] [[2007]].</ref>  Elmore, in November of 2006, posted a message to the band's official mailing list noting that the band had dissolved and no further plans had been announced.<ref>Elmore, Elizabeth.

==Musical and lyrical style==
The Reputation's music is influenced by that of Elmore's previous band, Sarge.<ref name="AMG Reputation">Draper, Jimmy.
