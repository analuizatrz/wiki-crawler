[[Image:OctopusFrontNew.jpg|thumb|250px|Obverse side of a standard adult card.]]The '''Octopus card''' is a rechargeable [[contactless]] stored value [[smart card]] used to transfer [[electronic payment]]s in online or offline systems in [[Hong Kong]]. Originally launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the city's [[mass transit system]], the Octopus card system has since grown into a widely-used payment system for virtually all public [[transport in Hong Kong]].<ref name="WorldBank">[http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/External/lac/lac.nsf/Sectors/Transport/D5A576A039A802C0852568B2007988AD?OpenDocument ''Hong Kong Smart Card System''], The World Bank Group.

==Name and logo==
[[Image:Möbius strip.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Möbius strip made out of paper and adhesive tape.]]
The [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] name for the Octopus card, ''Baat Daaht Tùng'' ({{zh-t|t={{linktext|八|達|通}}}}), literally means "eight-place pass". It was selected by the head of the [[MTR Corporation]], the parent company of Octopus Cards Limited, in a naming competition held in 1996.<ref name="Milestones">[http://www.octopus.com.hk/milestones/tc/index.jsp "八達通控股有限公司里程碑" (Octopus Holdings Milestones)], Octopus Holdings Limited.  Retrieved on [[2007-02-28]].  (in [[Traditional Chinese]])</ref> The number eight is a significant number in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] in that it is often used to indicate "many". For instance, the phrase ''sei tùng baat daaht'' ({{zh-t|t={{linktext|四|通|八|達}}}}) is a common expression loosely translated as "reachable in all directions". It is also considered a [[Numbers in Chinese culture#Eight|lucky number in Chinese culture]]. 

The [[English language|English]] name "Octopus card" was also selected from the naming competition,<ref name="MilestonesEng">[http://www.octopus.com.hk/milestones/en/index.jsp "Octopus Holdings Milestones"], Octopus Holdings Limited.  Retrieved on [[2007-02-28]].</ref> and coincides with the number eight in the Cantonese name, since an [[octopus]] has eight [[tentacle]]s. It is also particularly appropriate since an octopus is thought to be able to grab many things at the same time and this ability is conferred upon its cardholders who can use it in many different types of transactions.

The logo used on the card features a [[Möbius strip]] twisted sideways and into the shape of the [[Arabic numerals|arabic numeral]] for the number eight, "8", in order to indicate the card's "infinite" possibilities. The [[mathematics|mathematical]] symbol for [[infinity]], "∞", looks like a sideways "8" and is commonly thought to be derived from the Möbius strip.

==Types of Octopus cards==
Two main types of Octopus cards exist, On-Loan cards and Sold cards, together with two other less common types, the ''Airport Express Tourist Octopus'' and the ''MTR Airport Staff Octopus''.  

On-Loan cards are issued for usage in day-to-day functions, primarily for fare payment in transport systems.  No identification is required for the purchase of On-Loan cards.  If an owner loses a card, only the stored value of the card is lost.  This type of Octopus card is anonymous; no personal information, bank account or credit card details are stored on the card.<ref>[http://rfid.idtechex.com/knowledgebase/en/casestudy.asp?freefromsection=114 "Hong Kong Octopus financial/transport card, China"], The RFID Knowledgebase, [[2006-11-19]].  Retrieved on [[2007-02-21]].</ref>  On-Loan cards are further classified into ''Child'', ''Adult'', ''Elder'', and ''Personalised'' categories, with the first three based on age and different amounts of fare concession.<ref>[http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/cardtype/en/loan.jsp "On-Loan Octopus"], Octopus Cards Limited.  Retrieved on [[2007-02-13]].</ref> There was also another category of On-Loan cards, a violet-coloured Octopus card for students, that is now discontinued{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  This card has since been replaced with the ''Personalised'' card with "student status".  On-Loan Octopus cards may be purchased at all [[Mass Transit Railway]] (MTR) stations, all [[Kowloon Canton Railway]] (KCR) stations, the [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] (KMB) Customer Service Centre, [[New World First Ferry]] (NWFF) Octopus Service Centres, and the [[New World First Bus]] (NWFB) Customer Service Centre.<ref name="GetOctopus">[http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/apply/en/index.jsp "How to get Your Octopus"], Octopus Cards Limited.

The rainbow-coloured ''Personalised'' card is available upon registration.  If opted, the name and photo of the holder may be imprinted on the cards.  They can function automatically as a ''Child'', ''Adult'', or ''Elder'' card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on the card, hence accounting for different concessionary fares.  As of 2003, there were 380,000 holders of ''Personalised'' Octopus cards{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card can be used as a key card for access to residential and office buildings.<ref name="AccessControl">[http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/other/access/en/index.jsp "Access Control"], Octopus Cards Limited.  Retrieved on [[2007-02-21]].</ref>  If a ''Personalised'' card is lost, the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent unauthorised use of the card.  A refund would then be issued to the holder of the card for the value that remained on the card six hours after the loss is reported, minus a HK$20 handling fee.<ref>[http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/report/en/index.jsp "Lost Card Reporting"], Octopus Cards Limited.  Retrieved on [[2007-02-15]].</ref>

Retrieved on [[2007-02-13]].</ref>  They are souvenir cards that are frequently released by Octopus Cards Limited.

Sold Octopus cards may be purchased at selected MTR and KCR stations, and all [[7-Eleven]] stores.<ref name="GetOctopus" />

The special-purpose card, ''Airport Express Tourist Octopus'', was introduced by Octopus Cards Limited to target [[Tourism in Hong Kong|tourists in Hong Kong]]. There are two versions of this card, a HK$220 card with a free single ride on the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]], the [[Mass Transit Railway]] (MTR) train line that runs between the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] and the urban areas of Hong Kong, and a HK$300 card with two free single rides included. The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase.  Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR, and include HK$20 in usable value for non-MTR rides or other uses, and a HK$50 refundable deposit.  More value on these cards may be added if necessary. These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong for 14 or fewer days; users may be required to produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong.  ''Airport Express Tourist Octopus'' is available for purchase at all MTR stations.<ref>[http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/tourists/en/index.jsp "Octopus for Tourists"], Octopus Cards Limited.  Retrieved on [[2007-02-21]].</ref> 

The other special-purpose card, the ''MTR Airport Staff Octopus'', is available for the staff of Hong Kong International Airport and [[AsiaWorld-Expo]], a convention centre close to the airport, for commuting at a reduced fare between the airport and MTR stations via the Airport Express.  Staff who apply for the card may use it for a discount of up to 64% for Airport Express single journey fares.<ref>[http://www.etwb.hk/FileManager/EN/whats_new/possible_merger_of_mtrc_and_kcrc/Administration%20Response%20(Eng)%2026.5.06.pdf ''Panel on Transport Meeting on 26 May 2006''], Environment, Transport, and Works Bureau Government Secretariat, [[2006-07-04]].

==Octopus card usage==
Initially, the Octopus card was introduced for fare payment on the MTR, but the use of the card quickly expanded for multiple purposes.  The card can now be used to pay fares for all public transport in Hong Kong and to make purchases for consumer products at many stores in the city; it is accepted by more than 160 merchants.  Some notable businesses that accept Octopus cards include [[PARKnSHOP]], [[Watson's]], [[7-Eleven]], [[Starbucks]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Circle K]].  Additionally, the card can be used in many [[soft drink]] [[vending machine]]s, pay phones, photo booths, and [[car park]]s.<ref name="SmartCardAlliance">[http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~tijo/seminar/Case_Studies_and_Profiles_Report.pdf ''Smart Card Case Studies and Implementation Profiles''], Smart Card Alliance, 2003-12.  Retrieved on [[2007-02-22]].</ref>  Aside from consumer transactions, Octopus cards can also be used for access control in buildings and in some cases to record class attendance for students, in lieu of roll calls. 

===Payment using Octopus Cards===
[[Image:Octopus_McDonalds_Central.jpg|thumb|250px|Octopus card reader at a [[McDonald's]] [[restaurant]] in [[Central and Western District|Central]].]]
[[Image:OctopusReaderGate.jpg|thumb|250px|Octopus reader at an [[MTR]] ticket gate.]]
Making or recording a payment using the card while passing through an [[MTR]], [[KCR]], or ferry ticket gate, boarding a bus, alighting from a [[Hong Kong Tramways|tram]], or while purchasing items from various outlets can be done by holding the card against or in close proximity to an Octopus card reader. The Octopus card reader usually bears a yellow and orange colour scheme or logo similar to the card itself. After a brief moment (about 0.3 seconds per transaction),{{Fact|date=February 2007}} the reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep sound, and display the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card.  When riding the MTR and KCR systems, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users show their card again at the exit point.  A higher pitched sound will be emitted if the card is not accepted, i.e. if the stored value is insufficient to handle the transaction (value stored in the card is less than or equal to HK$0, or the transaction will cause the value in the card to deduct to more than -HK$35), or if the reader is unable to read the card owing to interference or insufficient time delay. Concession users are acknowledged by a higher pitched beep on all forms of transport except the MTR and KCR (excluding [[KCR Light Rail]]), which plays three notes in succession. 

As Octopus cards do not require physical contact with readers, and can be read from up to a few centimetres away through common materials such as cotton or leather; visitors to Hong Kong may find it strange to see people holding their wallets, handbags, backpacks or jackets on or near readers. And with other Octopus products, you may even see people waving their cellphone, watch or even a keychain over the Octopus reader.

The MTR and KCR charge less for journeys made using an Octopus card instead of conventional single-journey tickets. For example, the cost of a single journey from [[Chai Wan (MTR)|Chai Wan]] to [[Tung Chung (MTR)|Tung Chung]] is HK$23.10 with an Octopus card, and HK$26 with a single journey ticket. The KCR also uses the Octopus card to store the status of its One-Month Pass scheme. Passengers who register and purchase the One-Month Pass can use their Octopus cards as access control for unlimited rides on the specified line for a month, and they can travel on KCR trains even if their Octopus cards have insufficient or negative stored value. Other public transport operators also offer discounts (usually 10%) for using Octopus cards on higher fares and round-trip transits.

Apart from storing the transaction records and the value remaining, the Octopus cards can also be used to earn various kinds of rewards. In the past, passengers could earn "MTR Points" for their rides on the MTR to redeem collectibles or free single-ride tickets. Now the Octopus Cards Limited has also launched an Octopus Rewards Scheme,<ref>[http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/en/index.jsp Octopus Rewards]</ref> enabling citizens to earn reward points for every purchase in designated shops by a ratio of HK$200 = R$1 (reward point). The Octopus card should be registered beforehand and presented at the time of purchase, but payment can be settled by other means. The points stored in the card can be used to pay for purchases (R$1 = HK$1) or to redeem other products.

===Adding value and refunding===
[[Image:WuKaiShaStation-TicketMachines.png|thumb|280px|Concourse at the [[Wu Kai Sha (KCR)|Wu Kai Sha railway station]]. <br/><br/> The first machine on the left (one with the orange octopus logo and small screen attached to the wall) is for checking the balance of Octopus cards. The next two are add-value machines, while the remaining four are conventional ticket vending machines.]] Value can be added to the card through a number of ways. ''Add-value machines'' are located at all stations in the MTR and KCR networks which can be used to add more value to the cards (not available as an option as from 4 February 2007 according to TVB news){{Fact|date=February 2007}}. The add-value machines accept cash, as well as facilitate [[Electronic Funds Transfer]]. Alternatively, any [[point of sale]] ([[supermarkets]], [[convenience stores]]) that accepts Octopus cards also serve as a point for adding more value on the cards. MTR and KCR service centres also serve as a point for topping up value in Octopus cards. 

An On-loan Octopus card can store a maximum of [[HK$]]1,000, and has a deposit value of HK$50. The maximum negative value on a card is HK$35. There are a number of features in an Octopus card, especially, the ability to allow cardholders to use a card with an insufficient value to make one last trip even if the balance on the card is only at, say, HK$0.10. The maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]] and first class of the [[KCR East Rail]] is HK$34.8. Once the value in the card goes negative, the card is automatically frozen till more value is added to the card for further use. 

The Automatic Add Value Service (AAVS) is a transaction service wherein, a bank account is linked to a personalised card or an ordinary card. The owner of an Octopus card can sign up to use a local bank account or [[credit card]] to top up the value on the Octopus automatically. The card is automatically topped up with HK$250 after the balance goes below zero. Each card can be automatically topped up once every 24 hours. [[As of 2006]], 22 local banks including [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|HSBC]] and [[Bank of China (Hong Kong)]] offer this service.<ref>[http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/aavs/en/index.jsp Octopus Card AAVS Page] ''accessed'' [[December 11]], [[2006]].</ref>

Octopus cards are highly popular with tourists and residents alike , which explains how there are twice as many Octopus cards in circulation as there are [[Demographics of Hong Kong|people living in Hong Kong]] (although some people own more than one card). Surveys by the MTR show that this is because the deposit and the remaining value on the card are fully refundable, except for a HK$7 (HK$10 for personalised cards) administrative charge for cards refunded less than 3 months after issue. However, such practice is discouraged.

==Octopus gadgets==
Octopus sells "Octopus watches" - plastic wristwatches with a [[Sony]] [[FeliCa]] IC chip embedded inside, made by a number of suppliers. Users making payments can simply wave their arm over the card reader. These watches can be purchased at MTR service counters and convenience stores when available. 11,482 transponder watches were delivered to Octopus Cards Limited for the year ending [[31 May]] [[2003]], the latest year in which figures are available as of 2005.

[[Nokia]] also produced an Octo-phone, which has the smartcard embedded in the "Xpress-on" covers used in the Nokia 33nn series of [[mobile phone]]s, an example being the popular [[Nokia 3310]] model.

==Back-end technology and operations==
The Octopus system was designed by MTR's own experts and through an open tender, AES ProData (Hong Kong) Limited, now known as [http://www.erggroup.com/default.htm ERG Transit Systems]. ERG, an [[Australia]]n company based in [[Perth, Western Australia]], was selected as the lead supplier.<ref>http://www.erggroup.com/projects/hongkong.htm ERG GROUP - Projects: Hong Kong</ref><ref>http://www.visionengineer.com/tech/octopus.php Octopus Card - Multipurpose Smart Card</ref>

ERG was contracted to build a number of the components, including the back-end systems. Operations, maintenance and development is undertaken by Octopus, and in 2005, Octopus replaced the central transaction clearing house with its own system.

The Octopus card uses the [[Sony]] 13.56 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[FeliCa]] [[RFID|radio frequency identification]] ([[RFID]]) chip (and other related technology); and Hong Kong is the home of the world's first major public transport system using this technology. This is a "touch and go" system, so users need only hold the card in close proximity of the reader, and thus physical contact is not required. Data is transmitted at up to 212 kbit/s (the maximum speed for Sony FeliCa chips), compared with 9.6 kbit/s for [[Mondex]] and [[Visa Cash]].

Octopus uses a nonstandard system for RFID instead of the [[ISO 14443]] standards, since there were no standards in the nascent industry during its development in 1997. The operating range of the reader/writer is between 30 and 100 mm depending on the type of model being used.

===Clearing and settlement===
[[Image:OctopusEnquiryMachine.jpg|thumb|250px|An Octopus enquiry machine, which is used to check transaction details and outstanding balance of an Octopus card.]]
Octopus is specifically designed so that card transactions are relayed for clearing on a [[store and forward]] basis, without any requirement for reader units to have [[realtime]] round-trip communications with a central database or computer. ([[As of 2005]], the database systems are provided by [[Oracle Corporation]]). The stored data about the transaction may be transmitted by network after hours, or in the case of offline mobile readers may be retrieved by a hand held device, for example a [[Pocket PC]].

In practice, different data collection mechanisms are used by different transport operators, depending on the nature of their business. The [[MTR]] equips its stations with [[local area network]]s that connect the various components that deal with Octopus cards - [[turnstile]]s, add-value machines, check value machines and customer service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's [[Kowloon Bay (MTR)|Kowloon Bay]] headquarters through a [[frame relay]] [[wide area network]] (as of 2005, provided by [[PCCW]]), and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing. Similar arrangements are in place for [[KCR]] stations and for retailers such as [[7-Eleven]]. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system, depending on operator.

===Privacy and encryption===
The Octopus card uses [[encryption]] for all airborne communication and it uses two-way [[authentication]] based on [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI). In other words, data communications to and from the card are only established when mutually authenticated security handshaking is verified followed by transfer of encrypted data.

==Operator==
:''Main article: [[Octopus Cards Limited]]''

[[As of 2005]], Octopus Cards Limited (OCL), the operator of Octopus, is a joint-venture between six transit companies, namely [[MTR Corporation]] (57.4%), [[KCR]] (22.1%), [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] (KMB) (12.4%), [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] (5%), [[New World First Bus]] (NWFB) (3.05%) and [[First Ferry]] (0.05%). Since the [[Government of Hong Kong]] owns nearly three-quarters of MTR and 100% of KCR, it is the biggest effective shareholder in the company, although the business is operated on a commercial basis.

OCL has been aggressively expanding the use of Octopus in Hong Kong, and has won a number of contracts extending Octopus-style systems overseas, including the [[Netherlands]] and [[Changsha]] in [[Mainland China]].

OCL also settles accounts between the Octopus system and the operators/merchants. Initially, OCL was restricted to having 15% of Octopus card transactions being non-transport, as it operated as an "exempt card" under Hong Kong's ''Banking Ordinance'', but OCL was later granted a deposit-taking licence by the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] (HKMA), which allowed 50% of its transactions to be unrelated to transport. According to HKMA, [[HK$]]416 million (USD 53.3 million) is deposited in the Octopus system at any given time ([[as of 2000]]).

==History==
[[Image:Octopus reader.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An Octopus reader on [[New World First Bus|NWFB]]]]
The [[MTR]] network adopted a system of recirculated magnetic plastic cards when it started operations in 1979. These cards were either used as single journey tickets or as stored value tickets. The [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]] (KCRC) adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed [[Common Stored Value Tickets]].

In 1989, the Common Stored Value Tickets system was extended to [[KMB]] buses providing a feeder service to MTR/[[KCR]] stations and to Citybus, and was also extended to a limited number of non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.

[[Mass Transit Railway Corporation]] (MTR) eventually decided to adopt more advanced technologies, and in 1993 announced that it would move towards using contactless smartcards. To gain wider acceptance, MTR and KCRC invited three other major franchised transport operators in Hong Kong, namely KMB, [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] and the [[Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry]] (HYF) to form a joint venture company in 1994, known as Creative Star Limited (renamed Octopus Cards Limited in January 2002). (The only major public transport operator at the time not to join was [[China Motor Bus]], which pulled out of public transport altogether in 1998, in favour of its property development business, and had most of its bus routes transferred to NWFB).

The Octopus system was launched after three years of trials on [[1 September]] [[1997]]. Initially for use on services offered by the five joint venture partners, it was quickly extended to other transport services. In 2000, the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] granted a deposit-taking company license to the operator, removing previous restrictions that prohibited Octopus from generating more than 15% of its turnover from non-transit related functions.

In January 2001, a new shareholders' agreement was signed and the shares of HYF in the operator was transferred to NWFB and New World First Ferry. In conjunction with the privatisation of its parent company, [[MTR Corporation]], Octopus Cards Limited was also transformed from its previous non-profit making status to a profit making enterprise.

On [[29 June]] [[2003]], the Octopus card found another application when the Hong Kong Government started to replace all its 18,000 parking meters with a new Octopus card operated system. The replacement was completed on [[21 November]] [[2004]]. A number of government facilities including public swimming pools and sports facilities also adopted the Octopus system at around the same time.

In November 2003, Octopus Cards Limited secured a HK$200 million (USD 25.64 million) contract to help provide contactless smartcard technology in The [[Netherlands]]' system, combining the fare collection system of all its public transport companies - starting with rail operator [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]], bus and tramway operator [[Connexxion]], public transport companies of [[Rotterdam]] (RET) and [[Amsterdam]] (GVB) and the tram system in [[The Hague]] (HTM).

==Adoption of the Octopus card==
The Octopus system was launched in 1997, and 3 million cards were issued within the first three months. The main reason for the quick success of the system was that the MTR and KCR required that all holders of common stored value tickets replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, thus forcing their combined base of 3.3 million commuters (2.2 million for the MTR,<ref>[http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/investrelation/patronage.php Statistic of daily MTR patronage]</ref> 1.1 million for the KCR<ref>[http://www.kcr.com.hk/html/eng/corporate/about_kcrc/corporate_profile/index.asp Statistic of daily KCR patronage]</ref>) to switch quickly. Another reason is the coin shortage in Hong Kong after 1997; there is a belief that old coins in Hong Kong will appreciate in value, so many people stockpiled coins and waited for their value to increase.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} By November 1998, 4.6 million cards were issued, and this rose to 9 million by January 2002.

The Octopus system was quickly adopted by other Creative Star joint venture partners, and KMB reported that by 2000, most bus journeys were completed using an Octopus card, with very few coins used. (Boarding a bus in Hong Kong requires giving exact change; this can be cumbersome. For example, the March 2005 standard fare of a cross-[[Victoria Harbour|harbour]] journey was HK$8.90, which required a minimum of six coins.)

One of the key factors resulting in the success of Octopus cards is ubiquity: the card received the full backing of all transport operators in a particular area, facilitating widespread acceptance. This model has been adopted by the [[Suica]] system for [[JR East]] and the [[ICOCA]] system for [[JR West]].

==Comparison with other electronic cash systems==
[[Mondex]] specifically cited the widespread popularity of Octopus as the reason for withdrawing from the Hong Kong market in 2002. This is despite the fact that they launched their cards one year before the Octopus (in 1996), and had the backing of two of Hong Kong's biggest [[bank]]s, [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|HSBC]] and its subsidiary [[Hang Seng Bank]]. Academic studies suggest that the biggest cause was the lack of a compelling reason on the commuters' part to adopt the Mondex system which, unlike Octopus, did not have the solid backing of public transport companies and hence commuters and other travellers using their service.

Another reason might be that Mondex users had to have an account with the issuing bank, lessening its appeal for people using other banks.

An additional drawback was that Mondex cards required 5 seconds to process, compared with 0.3 second for a "touch and go" Octopus card. 84% of respondents in a [[University of Auckland]] survey attributed the success of Octopus to quick service.

Octopus cards are also anonymous, except for certain specific purposes.<ref>[http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/general/global/en/policy.jsp Octopus Card Personal Data Policy]</ref> Lack of [[anonymity]] is one of the reasons cited for the failure of many cash cards, such as [[Visa Cash|VisaCash]], which has the backing of two of Hong Kong's biggest banks, [[Bank of China (Hong Kong)|Bank of China]] and [[Standard Chartered Bank]].

==Comparison with other transit card systems==
Mass transit agencies have been using stored value, pre-paid cards for electronic ticketing since the 1970s. This market started to move from magnetic stripe technology to smart cards since the early 1990s; Hong Kong was actually the first major system to change over.

The Sony FeliCa technology used by Octopus is also used by [[Singapore]]'s [[EZ-link]] card for its [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus]] systems, [[Japan]]'s [[Suica]] on the [[JR East]], as well as the [[Nagasaki Smart Card]] system in [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. All these however use more up-to-date versions of the technology, compared with the older Octopus system. [[EasyCard]] from [[Taipei]]'s [[Taipei Rapid Transit System|TRTS]] is explicitly modelled after Octopus cards, and Octopus Cards Limited worked on the development of [[Shenzhen Metro]]'s [[Shenzhen TransCard]]. A number of other transport related smart card systems have used Octopus cards as a model in their development, including the [[Oyster Card]] for [[Transport for London|transport in London]] and [[Touch 'n Go]] for [[Rail transport in Malaysia|Kuala Lumpur Rail Transit System]].

[[Seoul]] also uses the [[T-Money]] system, which is used in the same way as the Octopus card. The [[T-Money]] system can be used on all [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] lines, and can also be used to transfer into the bus system in Seoul. Other such cards exist, which enables its owner to use it widely across Korea, including most of the bus systems in the [[Gyeonggi-do]] province.

==Future developments==
*On 27 June 2006, after 10 years of negotiations between Octopus card company and the taxi industry, the first trial of taxis equipped with Octopus card readers was launched in the New Territories with the Yellow Taxi Group and widely welcomed by the public and the local press. 

::On 30 October 2006, the South China Morning Post reported that eight of the 20 taxis participating in the trial had dropped out. Part of the reason was technical &mdash; drivers must return to the office every day for accounting. The Octopus card company said it would be upgrading the system to allow automatic account updating in the future. 

::Wong Yu-ting, managing director of the Yellow Taxi Group, also noted that "We have been trying to convince restaurants and retailers to offer discounts to Octopus taxi passengers, but the Transport Department has been a major obstacle." The Transport Department is against this approach for legal reasons. By law, taxi drivers may not solicit customers by offering fare discounts and the department sees little difference between retail and cash discounts. 

::Not mentioned in the article was the fact that there is no Octopus mechanism to add tips to fares, possibly reducing a taxi driver's income as tips would have to be given separately, in change or bills. 

*[[MTR]] has signed an agreement with the developer of the Shenzhen Metro's automatic fare collection system towards making Octopus cards compatible with the fare collection system in [[Shenzhen Metro]], which would require that the systems automatically convert fares denominated in [[Renminbi]] into Hong Kong dollars.
