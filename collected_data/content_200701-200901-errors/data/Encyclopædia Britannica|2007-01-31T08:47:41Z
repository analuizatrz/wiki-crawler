The '''''Encyclopædia Britannica''''' is a general [[encyclopedia]] published by [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]], a [[privately held company]] owned by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[billionaire]] and [[actor]] [[Jacqui Safra]].  The ''Britannica'' is the oldest continuously published [[English language|English-language]] encyclopedia.<ref name="EB_encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Encyclopedias and Dictionaries | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th ed. |  publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] | date = 2007 | volume = 18 | pages = 257&ndash;286}}</ref> Its level of scholarship is targeted at educated adult readers,<ref name="kister_1994">{{cite book | last = Kister | first = KF | authorlink = Kenneth Kister | year = 1994 | title = Kister's Best Encyclopedias: A Comparative Guide to General and Specialized Encyclopedias | edition = 2nd ed. | publisher = Oryx Press | location = Phoenix, AZ | id = ISBN 0-89774-744-5}}</ref> although simplified versions have been developed.  In spite of its name and preference for [[American and British English spelling differences|British spelling]], the ''Britannica'' has been published in the [[United States]] since 1901.<ref name="kister_1994" /> 

The ''Britannica'' was first published from 1768–71 in three volumes under the title '''''Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A dictionary of arts and sciences, compiled upon a new plan''''', partly as a conservative reaction to the provocative French ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Diderot]] published 1751-66.<ref name="EB_encyclopedia" />  Although the ''Britannica'' was published in a market with established English-language encyclopedias,<ref name="EB_encyclopedia" /> it quickly grew in popularity and size, reaching 20 volumes by the publication of its third edition in 1801.  In subsequent editions, the ''Britannica'' was able to recruit eminent authorities in various fields and, up to the 11th edition, published new research and scholarly theories.  In particular, the 9th and [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th editions]] (published in 1875-1889 and in 1911, respectively) are regarded as landmark encyclopedias for scholarship.  Beginning with the 11th edition, the American owners of the ''Britannica'' chose to simplify and shorten its articles, making them more accessible to lay-readers, with the goal of broadening its North American market.  In 1933, the ''Britannica'' became the first encyclopedia to adopt a "continuous revision" policy in which the encyclopedia would be revised and reprinted every year, and every article checked at least twice per decade.

Beginning with the current 15th edition, the ''Britannica'' adopted a unique three-part structure: a ''[[Micropædia]]'' of roughly 65,000 short articles (typically with no references, no named authors and fewer than 750 words), a ''[[Macropædia]]'' of roughly 700 long articles (each article having 2-310 pages, references and named contributors), and a single ''[[Propædia]]'' volume that seeks to give a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[outline]] of all human [[knowledge]]. The articles of the ''Micro-'' and ''Macropædia'' are both listed in [[Collation#Alphabetical sorting|alphabetical order]], but it is intended<ref name="propedia_preface">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = 5&ndash;8}}</ref> that readers interested in a given subject will study the ''Propædia'' first to grasp its context, then use ''Micropædia'' both as a tool to briefly introduce concepts and to find appropriate, more thorough information within the ''Macropædia'' articles.   The Index was removed from the first 15th edition (1974) but was restored in the second (1985), in response to reader requests.  The size of the ''Britannica'' has remained constant over the last 70 years, with roughly 40 million words addressing roughly half a million topics.<ref name="index_preface" >{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''Index'' preface}}</ref>

An increasing number of alternative information sources have reduced the popular demand for print encyclopedias significantly.  The ''Britannica'' has weathered this competition on the strength of its reputation, and by lowering its [[price point]], reducing its costs drastically and developing electronic versions on [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]] and the [[World Wide Web]].  Although its reputation for excellence has been questioned recently by several respectable critics, these criticisms have been challenged vigorously by the ''Britannica's'' management.

==History==
{{main|History of the Encyclopædia Britannica}}
===History of editions===
The ''Britannica'' has had 15 official editions, and numerous supplements and re-organizations.  However, the history of the ''Britannica'' can be usefully divided into five main eras.  

In the first era (1st-6th editions, 1768-1826), the ''Britannica'' was managed by its original founders, [[Colin Macfarquhar]] and [[Andrew Bell]], and by their friends and relations, such as [[Thomas Bonar]] , [[George Gleig]] and [[Archibald Constable]].  In this era, the ''Britannica'' moved from being a 3-volume set of dubious scholarship (1st edition) to a 20-volume set with excellent, but primarily Scottish, contributors.  

During the second era (7th-9th editions, 1827-1901), the ''Britannica'' was managed by the [[Edinburgh]] publishing firm, [[A & C Black]].   The contributors of this era are perhaps the most eminent authorities ever assembled by  the ''Britannica'', and included many authorities outside of [[Scotland]].  The first English-born chief editor was [[Thomas Spencer Baynes]], who oversaw the production of the justly famous 9th edition.

In the third era (10th-14th editions, 1901-1973), the ''Britannica'' was managed by American owners, who introduced aggressive marketing practices, such as [[direct marketing]] and [[door-to-door]] [[sales]].  The American owners also gradually simplified the ''Britannica's'' articles, making them less scholarly but more intelligible to the American mass market.  The ''Britannica'' was owned by [[Sears Roebuck]] for roughly 18 years (1920-1923, 1928-1943) and then by Senator and advertising mogul [[William Benton]] (1943-1973).  In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, [[Elkan Harrison Powell]], assumed the presidency of the ''Britannica'' and introduced the policy of continuous revision (still practiced today), in which every article is checked and possibly revised at least twice a decade.  Powell also began to aggressively develop new educational products that leveraged the ''Britannica's'' reputation.  In 1968, near the end of this era, the ''Britannica'' celebrated [[Bicentennial of the Encyclopædia Britannica|its bicentennial]].

In the fourth era (15th edition, 1974-1994), the ''Britannica'' introduced its 15th edition, which was radically re-organized into three parts.  Under the influence of [[Mortimer J. Adler]], the ''Britannica'' sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but also to systematize all of [[human knowledge]], striving to fulfil the dream of the [[Elizabethan]] [[philosopher]], [[Francis Bacon]].  The unfamiliar organization and the absence of an Index led to universal critical condemnation of the 15th edition; therefore, it was completely re-organized and indexed for its re-release in 1984.  This second version of the 15th edition continues to be published and revised; the latest version is the 2007 print version.

In the fifth era (1994-present), digital versions of the ''Britannica'' have been developed and released as CD/DVD-ROM and online.  The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] company split into two parts in 1999, with one part (responsible for the print version) retaining the company name and the other part (responsible for developing the digital versions) being called [[Britannica.com Inc.]].  Since 2001, these two companies share a single [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Ilan Yeshua]].

===History of dedications===
The ''Britannica'' was [[Dedication#Book dedication|dedicated]] to the reigning [[British monarch]] from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to the United States, to the current [[United States President]] and reigning British monarch.<ref name="kister_1994" />  For example, the 11th edition is dedicated "by Permission to His Majesty [[George V of the United Kingdom|George the Fifth]], King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and to [[William Howard Taft]], [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States of America]]."<ref name="EB_1911">{{cite book | year = 1910 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 11<sup>th</sup> edition| pages = p.3}}</ref>  The order of the two dedications changed with the relative power of the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], and with the relative sales of the ''Britannica'' in the two lands; thus, the 1954 version of the 14th edition is "Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, [[Dwight David Eisenhower]], President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth the Second]]".<ref name="EB_1954">{{cite book | year = 1954 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 14<sup>th</sup> edition| pages = p.3}}</ref>  Consistent with this tradition, the 2007 version of the current 15th edition is "dedicated by permission to the current [[President]] of the [[United States of America]], [[George W. Bush]], and Her Majesty, [[Queen Elizabeth II]]".<ref name="propedia_3">{{cite book | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, volume 30, ''[[Propædia]]'' | pages = p.3}}</ref>

===Perception of the Britannica===
Since the 3rd edition, the ''Britannica'' has enjoyed a reputation for excellence and catholic coverage of all knowledge.  [[Walter Yust]], long the Chief Editor of the ''Britannica's'' 14th edition, prided himself on a job well done after seeing the newpaper advertisement:<ref name="kogan_1958" >{{cite book | last = Kogan | first = Herman | year = 1958 | title = The Great EB: The Story of the Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | id = Library of Congress catalog number 58-8379}}</ref>

Over the years, many have read the entire ''Britannica'', taking anywhere from 3 to 22 years to do so.<ref name="kogan_1958" /> When [[Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar|Fath Ali]] became the [[Shah of Persia]] in 1797, he was given a complete set of the ''Britannica's'' 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this remarkable feat of scholarship, he extended his royal title to include "Most Formidable Lord and Master of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''".<ref>{{cite book | year = 1968 | title = Banquet at Guildhall in the City of London, Tuesday 15 October 1968: Celebrating the 200th Anniversary of the Encyclopædia Britannica and the 25th Anniversary of the Honorable William Benton as its Chairman and Publisher | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica International, Ltd.]] | location = [[United Kingdom]]}}</ref>  In our own era, [[A.J. Jacobs]], an editor at ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition ''Britannica'', describing his experiences in the well-received book, ''[[The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World]]'' (published 2004).  [[George Bernard Shaw]] claimed to have read the complete 9th edition &mdash; except for the scientific articles.  Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author [[C. S. Forester]] and [[Amos Urban Shirk]], an American businessman, who read the 11th edition over four years<ref name="kogan_1958" /> and the 14th edition, reading roughly three hours per night (source: interview in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', March 3, 1938).  [[Richard E. Byrd]] took the ''Britannica'' as reading material for his five-month stay at the South Pole in 1934.

References to the ''Britannica'' can be found throughout [[English literature]], most notably in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story, ''[[The Red-Headed League]]'', by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].

[[Image:Encyclopaedia Britannica 15 with 2002.jpg|thumb|15th edition (with 2 index volumes and 2002 year book)]]

===Corporate structure===
[[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] now owns registered [[trademark]]s on the words "Britannica", "Encyclopædia Britannica", "Macropædia", "Micropædia", and "Propædia", as well as its [[thistle]] logo.

In [[January 1996|January]] [[1996]], the ''Britannica'' was purchased by [[billionaire]] [[Switzerland|Swiss]] financier  and [[actor]] [[Jacob Safra]], who serves as its current Chairman of the Board.  In 1997, [[Don Yannias]], a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]]  In 1999, a new company, [[Britannica.com Inc.]] was spun off to develop the digital versions of the ''Britannica''; Yannias assumed the CEO-ship of the new company, while that of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. remained vacant for two years.  In 2001, Yannias was replaced by [[Ilan Yeshua]], who reunited the leadership of the two companies; Yannias has returned to investment management, but remains on Britannica's [[Board of Directors]].  

In 2003, the former management consultant [[Jorge Aguilar-Cauz]] was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.  Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the ''Britannica's'' Board of Directors.  Despite his subdued and scholarly manner, Cauz has been aggressively pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the ''Britannica's'' brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Elkan Harrison Powell]] in the mid-1930's.<ref name="propedia_Chair_President">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = p.2}}</ref>  

Under Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial woes, which the company has fought by lowering its [[price point]] and by drastic cost-cutting measures.  According to a report in the ''[[New York Post]]'', freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and its staff have gone years without raises.  In [[December 2002]], the ''Britannica'' management told employees it would raise the contribution paid into their [[401(k)]] accounts &mdash; just before eliminating those accounts completely.  Other cost-cutting measures have included mandates to use free photos.  A company spokesperson said, "We've had some cost reductions and belt-tightening but we're not going into details...We're a privately held company."{{citation needed}}

===Contributors===

The 2007 print version of the ''Britannica'' boasts 4411 contributors, many of whom are eminent in their fields such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[Michael DeBakey]] and [[Carl Sagan]].  Roughly one-quarter of the contributors are dead, some as long ago as 1947 ([[Alfred North Whitehead]]), while roughly another quarter are retired or emeritus.  Most (≈98%) contribute to only a single article; however, there are 64 contributors of three articles, 23 contributors of four articles, 10 contributors of five articles, and 8 contributors of more than five articles.  An exceptionally prolific contributor is Dr. [[Christine Sutton]] of the [[University of Oxford]], who contributed 24 articles on [[particle physics]].  Dr. Sutton is exceptional in another way; only 6.6% of the contributors to the 2007 ''Britannica'' are female{{fact}}, albeit representing a threefold improvement over the last century.<ref>{{cite book| last = Thomas | first = G | authorlink = Gillian Thomas | year = 1992 | title = A Position to Command Respect: Women and the Eleventh Britannica | publisher = Scarecrow Press}}</ref>

=== Staff ===

{{Details|Staff of the Encyclopædia Britannica}}

[[Dale Hoiberg]], a [[sinology|sinologist]], is the ''Britannica's'' Senior Vice President and editor-in-chief.<ref name="propedia_staff">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = p.745}}</ref> Among his predecessors as editors-in-chief were [[Hugh Chisholm]] (1903–13, 1920–24), [[James Louis Garvin]] (1926–32), [[Franklin Henry Hooper]] (1932–38), [[Walter Yust]] (1938–60), [[Harry Ashmore]] (1960–63), [[Warren E. Preece]] (1964–68, 1969-75), Sir [[William Haley]] (1968-69), [[Philip W. Goetz]] (1979-91),<ref name="kister_1994" /> and [[Robert McHenry]] (1992–97).<ref name="Britannica History">{{cite web |url=http://corporate.britannica.com/company_info.html
|title=History of Encyclopædia Britannica and Britannica Online |accessmonthday=October 17 |accessyear=2006 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}</ref> [[Anita Wolff]] and [[Theodore Pappas]] serve as the current Deputy Editor and Executive Editor, respectively.<ref name="propedia_staff" />  Prior Executive Editors include [[John V. Dodge]] (1950–64) and [[Philip W. Goetz]].

The ''Britannica'' maintains an editorial staff of five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors.  Presumably, these editors are responsible for contributing the mostly anonymous, mostly unreferenced articles of the ''Micropædia''.

===Editorial advisors===
The ''Britannica'' has an Editorial Board of Advisors, which currently includes 14 distinguished scholars: former [[Ecuador|Ecuadorian]] president [[Rosalía Arteaga]], Physiology/Medicine [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[David Baltimore]], religion scholar [[Wendy Doniger]], [[political economy|political economist]] [[Benjamin M. Friedman]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]] President [[Emeritus]] [[Leslie H. Gelb]], Physics [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Murray Gell-Mann]],  [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] President [[Vartan Gregorian]], [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] winner [[Zaha Hadid]], [[American Civil War]] [[historian]] [[James M. McPherson]], philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]], cognitive scientist [[Donald Norman]], [[musicology|musicologist]] [[Don Michael Randel]], economist [[Amartya Sen]],  and [[Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood]] and a [[Knight of the Thistle]].<ref name="propedia_editorial advisors">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = p.5}}</ref><ref>[http://corporate.britannica.com/board/ Encyclopædia Britannica Board of Editors] Accessed 09/27/2006</ref>  The median age of these advisors is around 70 years old.

The ''Propædia'' lists dozens of other editorial advisors, including many who have since died, the earliest in 1967 ([[Norwood Hanson]]).<ref name="propedia_other_editorial_advisors">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = 524&ndash;530}}</ref> For example, 74% of the advisors on "Part Six. Arts" are dead.  Similarly, 60% of the ''Propædia'' contributors have been dead for 30 years on the average: [[Rene Dubos]] (d. 1982), [[Loren Eiseley]] (d. 1977), [[Harold D. Lasswell]] (d. 1978), [[Mark Van Doren]] (d. 1972), [[Peter Ritchie Calder]] (d. 1982) and [[Mortimer J. Adler]] (d. 2001).<ref name="propedia_authors">{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''[[Propædia]]''| pages = p.530}}</ref>

===Coverage of topics and systemic bias===

The current ''Britannica'' covers a wide range of topics, but devotes much of its coverage to geography (26%), biographies (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophies (4%), and law (3%).<ref name="kister_1994" />  However, the ''Britannica'' seems to suffer somewhat from [[systemic bias]], albeit less so than several older encyclopedias.<ref name="kister_1994" />  Presumably, this bias reflects the interests and tastes of the principal readership to which the ''Britannica'' is marketed.  For example, the whole of [[Buddhism]] and most other religions is covered in a single ''[[Macropædia]]'' article; by contrast, Christianity has fourteen ([[Biblical literature]], [[Jesus]], [[Christianity]], the [[Apostle Paul]], [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Calvin]] and [[Calvinism]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Thomism]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[Crusades]], [[Luther]] and [[Theology]]), nearly half of all the ''Macropædia'' religion articles. The ''Macropædia'' also tends to describe only the Western branch of a field, e.g., History of Western architecture, History of Western literature, History of Western mathematics, History of Western music, History of Western painting, History of Western philosophy, History of Western political philosophy, History of Western sculpture, History of Western  theatre, Evolution of modern Western legal systems, Western philosophical schools and doctrines, and Western dance.

===2007 print version===
In the current 2007 version of the ''Britannica'', the ''Micro-'' and ''Macropædia'' encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each of roughly 1,000 pages. The ''[[Macropædia]]'' has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the ''[[Micropædia]]'' has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority of which have fewer than 750 words, no references and no named contributors.

Taken together, the ''Micropædia'' and ''Macropædia'' comprise ≈40 million words with ≈24,000 images.<ref name="index_preface" >{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15<sup>th</sup> edition, ''Index'' preface}}</ref>  The two-volume Index has 2,350 pages, listing the ≈700,000 topics mentioned in the ''Britannica''.<ref name="index_preface" />  ''Britannica'' uses a hybrid of [[British English|British]] and [[American English]], for example ''colour'' (not ''color''), ''centre'' (not ''center''), ''encyclopaedia'' (not ''encyclopedia''), but ''defense'' (not ''defence'').
 
Forty-six percent of the content of the encyclopedia was reportedly revised from 2003-2006.<ref>[http://corporate.britannica.com/library/print/eb.html Encyclopædia Britannica School & Library Site] Accessed 09/27/2006</ref> However, these appear to be largely minor revisions, since fewer than 10% of the ''Macropædia'' articles have changed over the past twenty years (1988-2007).

===CD-ROM and online versions===
[[Image:Britannica.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Encyclopædia Britannica 2005 Deluxe Edition [[CD-ROM]]]]

The ''Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2006 DVD'' contains over 55 million words and just over 100,000 articles. This includes 73,645 regular Encyclopædia Britannica articles, with the remainder drawn from the ''Britannica Student Encyclopædia'', the ''Britannica Elementary Encyclopædia'' and the ''Britannica Book of the Year'' (1993–2004), plus a small number of "classic" articles from early editions of the encyclopaedia. The package also includes a range of supplementary content including maps, videos, sound clips, animations and web links. It also offers study tools and dictionary and thesaurus entries from ''[[Merriam-Webster]]''.<ref>[http://britannicashop.britannica.co.uk/epages/britannicashop.storefront/EN/Catalog/1001 Encyclopaedia Britannica Online Shop] Accessed 09/27/2006</ref> 

The online version has more than 120,000 articles and is updated daily.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/premium Britannica Online] Accessed 10/23/2006</ref> It also has daily features, updates and links to news articles from ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the [[BBC]]. Subscriptions cost $69.95 per year in the United States and £39.99 per year in the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.britannica.co.uk/BT_Click_Buy.htm Britannica Online Store - BT Click&Buy] Accessed 09/27/2006</ref> Weekly and monthly plans are also available. Special subscription plans are offered to schools, colleges and libraries and these institutional subscribers provide an important part of Britannica's business. Articles may be accessed online for free, but only a few opening lines of the article are displayed. However, beginning in early 2007, Britannica made articles fully and freely available if the article is linked to from an external site.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/webmaster</ref>

=== Related printed material ===
There are several abbreviated Britannica encyclopedias.  The single-volume ''Britannica Concise Encyclopædia'' has 28,000 articles; ''Compton's by Britannica'', which incorporates the former ''[[Compton's Encyclopedia]]'', consists of 26 volumes with a total of 11,000 pages,<ref>[http://britannicashop.britannica.co.uk/epages/Store.sf/?ObjectPath=/Shops/Britannicashop/Products/SVOL_REF_0302 Encyclopaedia Britannica Online Shop - (SVOL_REF) 2003 Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]</ref> and is aimed at secondary school age children; ''My First Britannica'' is aimed at 6 to 12 year olds; and the ''Britannica Discovery Library'' is targeted at pre-school children. Since 1938 Britannica has published annually a ''Book of the Year'' chronicling the past year's events, also available online back to the 1994 edition (covering the events of 1993). Britannica Inc. also publishes a number of specialist reference works.

===Awards===
''Britannica'' has won many awards of recognition over the years. Most recently, the online ''Britannica'' won the 2005 [[Codie awards|Codie award]] for excellence in reference software; the Codie awards are granted yearly by the [[Software and Information Industry Association]] (SIIA) to honor the best products in various fields of software.  In 2006, the ''Britannica'' was a finalist, but the award went to [[Answers.com]].  Similarly, the CD/DVD-ROM version of the ''Britannica'' was recognized with the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the [[Association of Educational Publishers]], and with Codie Awards in 2001 and 2002.

==Competition==

In the era of the first edition, ''Britannica''’s main competitors were the encyclopedias of [[Ephraim Chambers]] and [[Dennis de Coetlogon]]; in the twentieth century, its competitors included ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]],'' the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]],'' and the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''.  Each of these encyclopedias had its own strengths and found its own market; some were written with exceptional clarity, others with superb illustrations.  Throughout its history, but especially after the 9th edition, the ''Britannica'' was considered to be the most magisterial encyclopedia, having the highest authority of any general encyclopedia.

Beginning in the 1990's, ''Britannica'' began facing new challenges from digital information sources. For many people the Internet started to become a regular source of information, facilitated by the development of search engines—for example [[Google]] created [[Google Scholar]] and [[Google Books]] with similar developments from other companies. Traditionally trusted print sources could now be found online, such as peer-reviewed journals and even entire university classes.  The Internet tended to include broader and more current coverage than ''Britannica,'' due to its lower barriers to entry.  Britannica's science, technology, politics, culture and modern history articles tended to become obsolete more quickly, a problem first analyzed in detail by former Britannica editor [[Walter Yust]].<ref name="EB_1954" /> Britannica's position was further weakened by the development of dedicated online encyclopedias, such as ''[[Encarta]]''.

''Britannica''s print-edition has remained relatively costly compared to most of its competitors, due to its high cost of production, staff and distribution.  Given the absence of [[switching cost]]s, a simple [[Porter 5 forces analysis]] suggests that the economic viability of [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] in the Internet era must rest on its [[brand equity]] and [[product differentiation]], i.e., the public perception that the ''Britannica'' is simply the best encyclopedia available at any price.{{fact}}

===Print encyclopedias===
Comparisons of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' with other print encyclopedias have been published over the years. A well-known comparison is that of [[Kenneth Kister]], who gave a thorough qualitative and quantitative comparison of the ''Britannica'' with two comparable encyclopedias, ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.<ref name="kister_1994"/>  For the ''quantitative'' analysis, ten articles were selected at random ([[circumcision]], [[Charles Drew]], [[Galileo]], [[Philip Glass]], [[heart disease]], [[IQ]], [[panda bear]], [[sexual harassment]], [[shroud of Turin]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) and letter grades (A-D,F) were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, recency and clarity. For accuracy, ''Britannica'' received one ''D'' and eight ''A''s. ''Encyclopedia Americana'' received eight ''A''s, and ''Collier's'' received one ''D'' and seven ''A''s. Thus, the number of articles evaluated varied because some of the articles found in one work were not present in another. Overall, ''Britannica'' received an average score of 92% for accuracy to ''Americana's'' 95% and ''Collier's’'' 92%. More recently, ''Britannica'' averaged an 86% to ''Americana's'' 90% and ''Collier's’'' 85%.{{cn}}

For all three encyclopedias, the four average grades fell between [[grade conversion|B- and B+]] (2.8-3.3 out of a possible 4 points), chiefly because none had an article on [[sexual harassment]].  The 1994 ''Britannica'' was faulted for still publishing an inflammatory story about [[Charles Drew]] that had long been discredited.  Nevertheless, a more thorough ''qualitative'' comparison of the encyclopedias caused [[Kenneth Kister|Dr. Kister]] to recommend ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' as the superior encyclopedia, primarily on the strength of its excellent writing, balanced presentation and easy navigation.

''Britannica'' did less well in both accuracy and recency when compared to the medium-sized encyclopedias ''World Book'' and ''Compton's,'' but fared better in accuracy when compared to encyclopedias from Funk & Wagnalls and Oxford University Press. However, ''Funk & Wagnall's'' received a higher recency score.

===Digital encyclopedias on CD/DVD-ROM===
In CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopedias, the most notable competitor of the ''Britannica'' is ''[[Encarta]]'', a modern, multimedia re-working of the [[Funk and Wagnalls]]' print encyclopedia.  Both occupy the same price range, with the 2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate CD or DVD costing [[United States dollar|US$]]50<ref name="Britannica Store">{{cite web |url= http://store.britannica.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=765&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=4&iSubCat=14&iProductID=765&show=all|title= The Britannica Store|accessmonthday= November 21|accessyear= 2006}}</ref> and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing [[United States dollar|US$]]45.<ref name="Encarta Store">{{cite web |url= http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-FB7-00442-Encarta-Premium-2007/dp/B000FL2DQS|title= Amazon.com: Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007: Software|accessmonthday= November 21|accessyear= 2006}}</ref> ''Britannica'' contains 100,000 articles, ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus]]'' (U.S. only), as well having Primary and Secondary School editions.<ref name="Britannica Store"/> ''Encarta'' contains 64,000 articles, a U.S. and U.K. dictionary, and a youth edition.<ref name="Encarta Store"/> Like ''Encarta'', the ''Britannica'' has been criticised for being biased towards [[United States]] audiences; for example, the [[United Kingdom]]-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a U.K. dictionary.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=502|title= Encyclopedia face-off: Encarta vs Britannica|accessmonthday= November 21|accessyear= 2006|last= Seymour|first= Ursula|date= 2006-11-09|work= PC Advisor|publisher= IDG}}</ref> The ''Britannica'' is regarded as more in depth than ''Encarta''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/2-2-2005-65221.asp|title= Battle of the Titans - Encarta vs. the Britannica|accessmonthday= November 21|accessyear= 2006|last= Vaknin|first= Sam|date= 2005-02-02|work= Buzzle.com}}</ref>

===Internet encyclopedias===
Online alternatives to the ''Britannica'' include [[Wikipedia]], a [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based free-content encyclopedia.  Wikipedia is the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, eclipsing even the ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'' (1407) which had held the record for nearly 600 years.  The 2007 print version of the ''Britannica'' does not mention Wikipedia, which is covered by other encyclopedias such as the 2006 ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]'', but the online ''Britannica'' does include an article about Wikipedia.<ref>[[Michael Aaron Dennis]]. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9433599/Wikipedia "Wikipedia"]. In ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'' Online. </ref>

Quantitative comparisons of the ''Britannica'' and Wikipedia have been conducted. On [[December 14]], [[2005]], the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reported that, within 42 randomly selected general science articles, there were 162 mistakes in Wikipedia versus 123 for ''Britannica'', with the errors in ''Britannica'' being oriented towards omissions rather than factual errors.<ref name="Giles_Nature_study_2005">{{cite web

}}</ref> and called for a "prompt" retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a ''Britannica'' year book, and not the encyclopedia; another two were from ''Compton's Encyclopedia'' (called the ''Britannica Student Encyclopedia'' on the company's web site) and yet another reviewer comment refers to an unknown publication. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles. ''Britannica'' cited several facts that were classified as errors by ''Nature'' but were not incorrect (e.g., the spelling of ''Crotona'' as ''Crotone''), and that several of its alleged "in-corrections" were merely a different interpretation. ''Nature'' defended its story and declined to retract, stating that as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of Britannica, it used whatever relevant material was available on Britannica's website.<ref>{{cite web

| title = Encyclopaedia Britannica: a response
| accessmonthday = October 21
| accessyear = 2006

| format = PDF
| publisher = Nature
}}</ref>

Web traffic is another quantitative metric for comparing the [[customer perceived value|perceived value]] (also called the ''perceived level of [[product differentiation]]'' in [[Porter 5 forces analysis]]) of two online [[encyclopedia]]s.  Wikipedia receives roughly 400-fold more traffic than does the online version of the ''Britannica'' ([http://britannica.com britannica.com]), based on independent page-view statistics gathered by [[Alexa (Internet)|Alexa]] from 15 October 2006 through 15 January 2007.

*vol. = volume
*sup. = supplement
<sup id="editionnote1">1</sup>''Supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. With preliminary dissertations on the history of the sciences.''

<sup id="editionnote2">2</sup> 8th to 14th editions included a separate index volume.

<sup id="editionnote3">3</sup> 9th ed. featured articles by notables of the day, such as [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] on [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (who became Lord Kelvin) on [[heat]].

<sup id="editionnote4">4</sup> 10th ed. included a maps volume and a cumulative index volume for the 9th and 10th edition volumes: ''the new volumes, constituting, in combination with the existing volumes of the 9th ed., the 10th ed. ... and also supplying a new, distinctive, and independent library of reference dealing with recent events and developments''

<sup id="editionnote5">5</sup> ''Vols. 30-32 ... the New volumes constituting, in combination with the twenty-nine volumes of the eleventh edition, the twelfth edition''

<sup id="editionnote6">6</sup> This supplement replaced the previous supplement:  ''The three new supplementary volumes constituting, with the volumes of the latest standard edition, the thirteenth edition.''

<sup id="editionnote7">7</sup> This edition was the first to be kept up to date by continual (usually annual) revision.

<sup id="editionnote8">8</sup> The 15th edition (introduced as "Britannica 3") was published as multiple sets: the 10-volume ''Micropædia'' (containing short articles and served as an index), the 19-volume ''Macropædia'', plus the ''Propædia'' (see text). 

<sup id="editionnote9">9</sup> In 1985 the system was modified by removing the index function from the ''Micropædia'' and adding a separate two-volume index; the ''Macropædia'' articles were further consolidated into fewer, larger ones (for example, the previously separate articles about the 50 U.S. states were all included into the "United States of America" article), with some medium-length articles moved to the ''Micropædia''. 

The first CD-ROM edition was issued in 1994. At that time also an online version was offered for paid subscription. In 1999 this was offered for free, and no revised print versions appeared. The experiment was ended, however, in 2001 and a new printed set was issued in 2002.
