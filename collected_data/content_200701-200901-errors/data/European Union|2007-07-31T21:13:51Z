The '''European Union''' ('''EU''') is a ''[[sui generis]]'' supranational political body, made up of twenty-seven [[Europe]]an countries. It was established in 1993 by the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and is the [[de facto]] successor to the [[European Economic Community]] founded in 1957 by the [[Treaty of Rome]]. Since 1957 new [[Enlargement of the European Union|accessions]] have raised the number of [[European Union member states|member states]], and powers have expanded. As a result, the EU can be described as both a [[supranationalism|supranational]] and an [[intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] body.

==History==
{{main|History of the European Union}}
In 1945, at the end of the [[Second World War]], [[Europe]] was marked by unprecedented devastation and human suffering. It faced new political challenges, in particular reconciliation among the peoples of Europe and the growing political division between the [[USA]] and the [[USSR]], two ideologically-opposed superpowers. This situation favoured a long held idea of European unification through the creation of common institutions. In a famous speech at the [[University of Zurich]] in 1946, [[Winston Churchill]] called for a ''[[United States of Europe]]'' and the creation of a [[Council of Europe]]. The latter was established in [[Strasbourg]] on [[5 May]] [[1949]] as the first European institution. The [[Schuman Declaration]], based on a plan by [[Jean Monnet]] and signed [[9 May]] [[1950]], gave rise to the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). The aim of the ECSC was to integrate the markets for the industrial resources necessary for reconstruction of Europe, and the production of weapons of war. The founding members of the community, who signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)]], were [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]] (who already co-operated as the [[Benelux countries]]) and [[West Germany]].<ref name="ENA WW2">

[[Image:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The founding nations signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957]]

Two additional communities were created by the [[Treaties of Rome]] in 1957; the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), establishing a [[Customs Union]] and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC or Euratom) for cooperation in [[nuclear energy]]. The ECSC and Euratom were merged into the EEC in 1967 with the signing of the [[Merger Treaty]]. They had a single membership with a combined set of treaties and institutions, and the collective was referred to as the ''European Communities'' (now, the [[European Community]], within the EU).<ref name="ENA Euratom">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A European Atomic Energy Community|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3054|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ENA EEC">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A European Customs Union|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3056|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ENA Merge">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Merging the executives|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=473|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

It also included provisions for common [[immigration policy|policy on the temporary entry of persons]] (including the Schengen Visa), the harmonisation of external [[border]] controls, and cross-border police co-operation. The agreement has been subsequently signed by 30 states, including most EU member states and three non-EU members ([[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]]). By 2007 15 member states had implemented the agreement. The [[Republic of Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] take part only in the police co-operation measures and not in common border control and visa provisions.<ref name="Europa Schengen acquis">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Schengen acquis and its integration into the Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2005|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33020.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> In 1986 the [[European flag]] was adopted and leaders signed the [[Single European Act]].

With enlargement toward eastern Europe on the agenda, the [[Copenhagen Criteria]] were agreed and the [[Maastricht Treaty]] formally established the EU on [[1 November]] [[1993]].

In 1994 the [[European Economic Area]] was established, allowing the non-members [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]] access to the EU's [[single market]]. In 1995 [[Austria]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] joined the EU. The [[Amsterdam Treaty]] was signed in 1999, shortly after the [[Santer Commission#Resignation|resignation of the Santer Commission]]. In the same year the [[euro]] was introduced for bank transfers, and euro coins and banknotes replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states in 2002. In 2003 the [[Nice Treaty]] came into force, followed a year later by the [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession]] of ten countries (eight central and eastern European countries, [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]]).<ref name="Europa History 90-99"/><ref name="Europa History 00">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A decade of further expansion|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

Later in 2004, the [[European Constitution]] was signed in Rome, though it was never fully ratified after rejection by French and Dutch voters in [[referendum|referenda]]. In 2007, it was agreed to replace that proposal with a new [[Reform Treaty]] (or "Lisbon Treaty") that would not have constitutional elements but would reform [[Treaties of the European Union|existing treaties]]. At the start of that year [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] joined the EU and the euro was adopted by [[Slovenia]]. It was agreed to allow Cyprus and Malta to adopt the euro at the start of 2008.<ref name="Europa History 00"/>

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the European Union}}

[[Image:Josesocrates2006.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[President-in-Office of the European Council]], [[José Sócrates]]]]

The politics of the EU primarily cover the economy, which is reminiscent of its history originating in a series of economic communities after the Second World War. When the Maastricht Treaty established the EU, the scope was expanded to the [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar system]] whereby foreign and home affairs were added to the intergovernmental domain of the EU.<ref name="Glossary Pillars">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Pillars of the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/eu_pillars_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> 

The expansion of the EU has been seen as a means for promoting and reinforcing peace and democracy on the European continent following the Second World War and later after the decline of the [[Soviet Union]]. Another aim of the EU has always been to increase its economic prosperity.<ref name="Enlargement voice">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU enlargement - voices from the debate|work=|publisher=British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|date=|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1139992114487|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Accession to the European treaties necessarily means to give over some powers from the national government to an international organisation (as is the case for all international treaties). The powers that passed from national governments to the EU are large compared to most international treates. The ongoing integration of Europe is becoming contested on the grounds that it reduces members' national sovereignty too much.<ref name="Anti-EU">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=FAQs on the EU, from the campaign trail|work=|publisher=Sovereignty|date=2001|url=http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/campquest.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>
Enlargement together with integration (new treaties) are seen by some as parallel processes, vital to the EU or it will fail: this is know as the "bicycle theory".<ref name="FT Bicycle">{{cite web|last=Bounds|first=Andrew|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Brussels blog: Bicycle wobbles on the way to Doha|work=|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=2007|url=http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2007/05/bicycle_wobbles.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

To govern and guide the ongoing integration and the larger number of members states the [[European Constitution]] was proposed. However ratification of this treaty was rejected by Dutch and French voters.<ref name="BBC Reform">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU leaders agree on reform treaty|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6232540.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> By the end of 2007, a new "[[Reform Treaty]]" should agreed upon by the leaders to come into force in 2009. The new treaty would carry out most of the reforms enviseded in the Constitutions but without the constitutional elements and would add to, not replace, the existing treaties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24522|title=EU unveils bulky new treaty draft|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-07-09]]|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref>

One of the most important political issues concerns the [[EU budget]]. The [[Financial Perspective]] for 2007–2013 was defined in 2005 when EU members agreed to fix the common budget to 1.045% of the [[European]] [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]].<ref name="Financial 2007">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Financial Perspective 2007–2013|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Consilium]]|date=2005|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/misc/87677.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> However there are long running disputes over the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] and the [[UK rebate]]. The UK rebate is a special discount on the UK contributions to the EU budget. The rebate was allowed as the UK was receiving relatively little agricultural support compared to other countries. The agricultural policy has historically dominated much of the EU's spending. Reduction of the agricultural spending and abolition of the UK rebate are listed as important reforms of the system by various groups. This is however problematic as unanimity is required to change these agreements, meaning that both the gross receivers from agricultural policies and the UK have to give up a privileged position. So far no agreement has been reached.<ref name="BBC Rebate">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title= Fact check: Britain's EU rebate|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4094652.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

The EU is governed by a number of institutions, primarily the [[European Commission|Commission]], [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and [[European Parliament|Parliament]]. The [[European Commission]] acts as the [[executive branch]]. It is currently composed of 27 commissioners, one from each member state. The commission is responsible for drafting all proposed rules in order to co-ordinate European Law. It also controls some agencies and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Union. The president of the commission is nominated by the European Council, and confirmed by the Parliament.<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The European Commission|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The [[Council of the European Union]] (also known as the Council of Ministers) forms one half of the EU's [[legislative branch]], the other being the Parliament. It is composed of the national ministers responsible for the area of EU law being addressed. For example, European legislation regarding agriculture would be treated by a Council composed of the national ministers for agriculture. The body's presidency rotates between the member states every six months. To increase stability the current president member state co-operates with both the previous and the next president member state.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> It should not be confused with the [[European Council]], which is not an official institution (although the European Council is an important body and shares its presidency with that of the Council of the EU). It is composed of the heads of government and the [[President of the European Commission]]. The European Council meets four times a year.<ref name="Europa Institutions ECouncil">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Council|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=429&lang=en|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> The other half of the legislative branch is the [[European Parliament]] and is the only Union body composed of representatives directly elected by the citizens of the [[EU member states]]. Every five years citizens in all member states elect 785 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) who form the second half of the EU's legislative branch. Although the elections are for national candidates, the members of the parliament have seats according to political ideals rather than nationality.

The [[Judicial branch]] of the EU consists primarily of the [[European Court of Justice]] composed of 27 judges, one judge being nominated by each member-state. The president is elected from the judges. Below the Court of Justice there is a lower court called the [[Court of First Instance]] created to reduce the work load of the Court of Justice. There is also the [[European Court of Auditors]], which monitors the EU's accounts.<ref name="Europa Institutions Justice">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: Court of Justice|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/justice/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="Europa Institutions Auditors">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

There is no official capital of the EU. The [[Location of European Union institutions|locations of the institutions]] are spread across many cities and several member states.

The European Community is the oldest supranational element of the EU. The community is the direct successor of the European Economic Community, and is now the first pillar of the EU. It is within this pillar where certain elements of sovereignty are pooled and controlled by supranational institutions such as the Commission and Parliament. For example, within matters where sovereignty is given to the Community, the Commission has the sole right to initiate legislation. Other matters, such a home affairs, fall within the responsibility of an intergovernmental agreement between the members. The principle of subsidiarity in this pillar is designed to ensure that decisions are taken at the lowest level of government.<ref name="Sweden Pillars">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The three pillars of the EU|work=|publisher=[[Presidency of the European Union|Swedish Presidency, 2001]]|date=2007|url=http://www.eu2001.se/static/eng/eu_info/korthet_pelare.asp |format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> In the Amsterdam Treaty, some powers were moved from the third pillar to the Community<ref name="Glossary Pillars"/> and in 2007, the Court of Justice ruled that the Community has powers to propose legislation for [[criminal law]].<ref name="Rechtennieuws Powers">{{cite web|last=Duchateau|first=Michiel|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Expanding the powers of the European Community|work=|publisher=Rechtennieuws|date=2007|url= http://rechtennieuws.nl/14414/expanding-the-powers-of-the-european-community.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

In addition to EU commission policies such as the agricultural policy, and the [[Common Fisheries Policy]], there are a number of [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds]] aimed at promotion of the development of poorer, underdeveloped, regions across the Union.

Other funds provide emergency aid, support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to EU standard ([[Phare]], [[Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession|ISPA]], and [[SAPARD]]), support to the [[commonwealth of independent states]] ([[TACIS]]). 

With regard to the powers of the European Commission, there has been a desire to address the [[democratic deficit in the European Union|democratic deficit of the EU]] through the development of [[citizenship of the European Union|citizenship of the EU]].

Defence and security are traditionally matters of national [[sovereignty]]. EU policies in this area were established as the second of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] in the [[Maastricht Treaty]] of 1992. The ''Common Foreign and Security Policy'' or CFSP were further defined and broadened in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of 1997. The Amsterdam treaty defined five objectives for the CFSP: to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the European Union in conformity with the  principles of the [[United  Nations Charter]]; to strengthen the security of the Union in all ways; to preserve peace and strengthen international security, in  accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter,  as well as the principles of the [[Helsinki Final Act]] and the objectives of the [[Paris Charter]], including those on external borders; to promote international co-operation; to develop and consolidate democracy and the [[rule of law]], and respect for [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms; the foreign and security policy is coordinated by the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]], currently [[Javier Solana]].<ref name="Europa CFSP">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) - Overview|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=2002|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/intro/index.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

Foreign policy is agreed upon on an inter-governmental basis. This can lead to differing national policies which happened for example regarding Iraq.<ref name="BBC Iraq statement">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Divided EU agrees Iraq statement|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2697667.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> 
Besides emerging international policy, the international effect of the Union is felt through [[Enlargement of the European Union|Enlargement]]. The potential benefits of becoming member is considered a major factor contributing to reform and stabilisation of former Communist countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name="Enlargement voice"/> The Union is also the largest contributor of [[humanitarian aid]] in the world.

The third of the three pillars of the EU focuses on cooperation in criminal matters, including sharing of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] (through [[Europol]] and the [[Schengen Information System]]), agreement on common definition of [[crime|criminal offences]] and expedited [[extradition]] procedures. It is the EU instrument of [[law]] enforcement and fighting [[racism]]. [[Eurojust]] is a mirror organisation to Europol, dealing the judicial matters. The police and judicial pillar was created as the ''Justice and Home Affairs'' pillar in the Treaty of Maastricht. Some issues were subsequently transferred in the Amsterdam Treaty transferred to the integrated first ([[European Community]]) pillar, including the areas of illegal [[immigration]], [[visa (document)|visas]], [[refugee|asylum]], and judicial co-operation.

The two main treaties that form the basis of EU law are the Treaty of the European Community (also know as the [[Treaty of Rome]]) from 1957, and the Treaty of the European Union (or the [[Maastricht treaty]]) from 1992. The Treaty of Rome deals with the "first pillar" of the EU: the competence of the "European Community" to act in the social and economic arena. The Maastricht treaty created the European Union and added two further "pillars:" the competence of the EU in relation to foreign and security policy, and the competence in relation to justice and home affairs. For legislation within these two latter pillars, a consensus among member states is required.<ref name="Europa Treaties">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European treaties|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2005|url=http://europa.eu/abc/treaties/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

EU law covers a broad range of topics, often as broad as the legislation of the member states.<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> Where a conflict arises between EU law and the law of a member state, EU law takes precedence.<ref name="Supremacy">In general, see C 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v.

The territory of the EU consists of the combined territories of its 27 member states with significant exceptions outlined below. The territory of the EU is not the same as that of [[Geography of Europe|Europe]], as significant parts of the continent, such as [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]] and European [[Russia]], are outside the EU, and some [[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas territories]] are part of the EU while not being geographically part of Europe.

The landscape, climate and economy of the EU are heavily influenced by its long coastline. It is estimated that the coastline of the EU is over 150,000 km long. The combined member states of the EU share [[countries bordering the European Union|land borders]] with 21 EU non-member states.<ref name="Europa Members">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European countries|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2007|url=http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

Some parts of member countries are not part of the EU, although they are part of the European continent. Examples include the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Faroe Islands]]. Several territories associated with member states that are outside geographic Europe are also not part of the EU (such as [[Greenland]], [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and all the non-European territories associated with the [[United Kingdom]]). On the other hand, some overseas territories are formally part of the EU even if they are not geographically part of Europe, such as the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Madeira]], [[Martinique]] and [[Réunion]].<ref name="Amsterdam">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Treaty of Amsterdam|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Eur-Lex]]: Official Journal|date=|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref><ref name="Consolidated Treaties">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Consolidated Treaties on European Union and establishing the European Community|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Eur-Lex]]|date=|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2006:321E:0001:0331:EN:pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ECB where euro">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Where is the euro legal tender?|work=|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|date=2006|url=http://www.ecb.int/bc/faqbc/circulation/html/index.en.html#q2|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

Including overseas territories of member states, the EU includes most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] to [[Tropical climate|tropical]], rendering meaningless meteorological averages for the EU as a whole. The majority of the population lives either in areas with a [[Mediterranean climate]] (southern Europe), a temperate [[maritime climate]] (Western Europe), or a warm summer continental or [[hemiboreal]] climate (in eastern member states).<ref name="Humid Continental climate">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Humid Continental Climate|work=|publisher=University of Wisconsin|date=2007|url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

The [[European Coal and Steel Community]] was founded in 1952 by six countries. Between 1973 and 2007 there have been six waves of enlargement bringing the current membership up to 27.

To join the EU, a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 [[Copenhagen]] European Council. These require a stable democracy respecting [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning market economy capable of competition within the Union and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU laws. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria rests with the [[European Council]].<ref name="Accession Criteria">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria)|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> Enlargement has been seen as a positive force by many, for example in democratising Eastern Europe<ref name="Enlargement voice"/> and causing war crimes suspects in the former [[Yugoslavia]] to be brought to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref name="EUObserver ICTY">{{cite web|last=Kubosova|first=Lucia|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Del Ponte: EU enlargement bringing justice to Balkans|work=|publisher=EU Observer|date=2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24360|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

[[Image:Euro banknotes.png|thumb|right|190px|The [[Euro]] is adopted by 13 member states]]

The EU was created first and foremost as an economic union. Its combined [[single market]] is notionally the largest economy in the world, with an estimated nominal GDP of 11.6 [[euro]] ([[United States Dollar|USD]]14.5) trillion in [[2006]] (compared to the second largest economy, the [[United States of America|United States]], with a GDP of $13.2 trillion) accounting for 35% of world GDP.<ref name"GDP list">European Union: USD14,527,140 billion; United States: USD13,244.550 billion.<br>{{cite web | url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/index.aspx| title = World Economic Outlook Database, April 2007 Edition| accessdate = 2007-07-15| year = 2007 | month = April| work = World Economic and Financial Surveys| publisher = International Monetary Fund}}</ref> The European Union is the largest [[export]]er in the world and the second largest importer.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html CIA rankorder], CIA Worldfactbook,  Accessed [[May 27]], [[2007]]</ref> It is the biggest trading partner to many countries, such as [[China]]<ref name="Trade China">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=China now EU's biggest import market|work=|publisher=People's Daily Online|date=[[2007-01-31]]|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200701/31/eng20070131_346408.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref> and [[India]].<ref name="Trade India">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=India|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=June 2007|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/issues/bilateral/countries/india/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>

The EU has been a legislative power in the area of energy policy for many years. This involvement evolved from of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]].

The population of the EU is that of its [[Member states of the European Union|member states]], and changes with each accession (or, more rarely, secession). As each members has its own demographic make-up, changes in members also affect demographic averages such as [[life expectancy]] and [[fertility rate]], hence the demographic of the EU may change relatively fast.

The EU provides [[Directorate-General for Interpretation (European Commission)|interpretation]], [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|translation]] and [[Publications Office (European Union)|publication services]] in its official languages, but only legislation and important documents are produced in all 23 official languages. Other documents are translated only into the languages necessary for their use. For internal purposes the EU institutions make their own language arrangements. The European Commission, for example, conducts its internal business in English, French and German, and only use all languages for public information and communication purposes.

The most common religious belief in the EU is Christianity. European Christianity can be roughly divided into [[Roman Catholicism]], a wide range of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches (especially in northern Europe) and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] (in south eastern Europe).<ref name="Christianity Britannica">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Chrisianity|work=|publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]|date=|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9360716|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> <br>
[[Judaism]] has had a long history, and in the past frequently dark history, in Europe. In 2002 the EU had an estimated [[Jewish population]] of roughly over a million, including about 519,000 in France and about 273,500 in the United Kingdom (compare with about 5 million Jews living in [[Israel]].<ref>Jewish population figures may be unreliable.

===Church and state===
The EU is a [[secular]] body, with no formal connections to any [[religion]] and no mention of religion in any current or proposed treaty.<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Reform Treaty have included proposals to mention [[Christianity]] and/or [[God]] in the preamble of the text. This call has been supported by Christian religious leaders, most notably the [[Pope]].<ref name="BBC Vatican">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Vatican resists European secularism|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2005-02-11]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4253937.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref> However explicit inclusion of a link to religion faced opposition from secularists and the final Constitution referred to Europe's "Religious and [[Humanist]] inheritance". A second attempt to include Christianity in the treaty was undertaken in 2007 with the drafting of the Reform Treaty. [[Angela Merkel]] promised the Pope that she would use her influence during Germany's presidency to try to include a reference to Christianity and God in this replacement for the constitution. This has provoked opposition, not least in the German press,<ref name="God Const">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European press review: God and the EU Constitution|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]/[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|date=[[2006-09-12]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5337166.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref> and as this inclusion may have caused problems in reaching a final agreement, this attempt was given up.<ref name="EUO Merkel God">{{cite web|last=Rettman|first=Andrew|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Merkel gives up on God in EU treaty|work=|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2006-09-12]]|url=euobserver.com/15/24066 |format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

In the secularising EU, [[Holy See|Vatican]] has been vocal against a perceived "militant atheism"; which it based on the rejection of religious references in the EU treaties, the rejection by Parliament of [[Rocco Buttiglione]] as a [[European Commissioner]] in 2004, and the legalisation of [[Same-sex marriage]] in countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain (and other advances in [[LGBT rights in Europe|LGBT rights in the EU]]).<ref name="BBC Vatican"/>

==Culture==
{{see|Cultural policies of the European Union|Culture of Europe}}

[[Image:Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]], one of the two [[European Capital of Culture|European Capitals of Culture]] for 2007]]

The EU has no specific culture or cultural history, other than those of its member states, so EU culture is intertwined with the [[culture of Europe]]. Within the EU, supporters of [[European integration]] often appeal to a shared European historical/cultural heritage, typically including [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], the [[feudalism]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], 19th century [[Liberalism]] and (sometimes) negative elements such as the [[World Wars]]. European values are assumed to be grounded in this shared heritage.<ref>For example: {{cite web | url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-3007-043-02-07-901-20070208IPR02888-12-02-2007-2007-true/default_en.htm | title =Priority is dialogue for partnership and tolerance | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | author = Hans-Gert Poettering| authorlink = Hans-Gert Pöttering| date = 2007-02-13 | work = Inaugural speech by the new president of the European Parliament | publisher = European Parliament | quote = }}</ref> Whereas there is some agreement on the historical areas in the history of Europe, the status of [[Christianity]] as an essential element in 'European heritage' is more controversial. Adopting Christianity as an essential part of European culture may relate unfavourable to the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union|accession of the secular, but largely Muslim, Turkey]] to the EU. People in favour of Turkish accession argue that this would show beyond doubt that EU is not an exclusively 'Christian club', while opponents use the non-Christian culture of Turkey as an argument against its possible membership.<ref name"OD CClub">{{cite web|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Turkey’s European problem|work=|publisher=Open Democracy|date=[[2004-12-14]]|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/content/articles/PDF/2264.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Cultural attitudes and values of the EU population are diverse, influenced not necessarily by nationality but by [[social class]], religion, level of education, and [[ethnicity]]. Hence cultural attitudes are neither necessarily European nor national in character. The motivation of member [[state]]s in EU participation is mainly economic and political in nature. The EU in itself has little common culture, other than the culuture that is also shared with the rest of Europe or even beyond. Cultural diversity, intercultural dialogue and an emphasis on tolerance and consensus are part of the common culture being developed by the European Union.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2007/com2007_0242en01.pdf | title = Communication from the commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a European agenda for culture in a globalizing world  | format=PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | date = 2007-05-10| publisher = Commission of the European Communities}}</ref>

There is however some EU cultural cooperation. Cultural cooperation between member states has become a community competency since its inclusion in 1992 in the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref name="Bozoki">{{cite web|last=Bozoki|first=Andras|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Cultural Policy and Politics in the European Union|work=|publisher=|date=|url=http://137.204.115.130/activities/download/Bozoki/Cultural%20Policy%20and%20Politics%20in%20the%20European%20Union.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> Actions taken in the cultural area by the European Union include the [[Culture 2000]] 7-year programme,<ref name="Bozoki"/> the [[European Cultural Month]] event,<ref name"Culture Month">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Culture Month|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_eu_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> the [[Media Plus]] programme,<ref name"Media Plus">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Media programme|work=|publisher=philatelism.com|date=[[2007-07-05]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/media/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> and the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme — where one or more cities in the EU are selected for one year to assist cultural development of the city.<ref name"Capital Culture">{{cite web|last=Bozoki|first=Andras|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Capitals of Culture|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_eu_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> In addition, the Union gives grants to cultural projects (233 in 2004) and has launched a webportal dedicated to Europe and Culture, responding to the European Council's expressed desire to see the Commission and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by the most advanced technological means."<ref name"Culture Portal">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Cultural heritage as a vehicle of cultural identity|work=|publisher=philatelism.com|date=[[2007-07-05]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/portal/activities/heritage/cultural_heritage_vehic_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

===Sport===
{{main|Sport policies of the European Union}}

[[Image:Amsterdam ArenA.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular sport in the EU countries ([[Amsterdam ArenA]], [[Netherlands]])]]

[[Sport policies of the European Union|Sport policy]] is largely the domain of the member states, with the EU mostly playing an indirect role. Recently the EU launched an anti-doping convention. The role of the EU might increase in the future, if (for example) the [[Reform Treaty]] were to be ratified by all member states.<ref name"EUO Sport">{{cite web|last=Goldirova|first=Renata|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Brussels' first-ever move into sport area set to spark controversy|work=|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24455|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> Other policies of the EU can have an impact on sports, for example the freedom of employment which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]], which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with EU nationality.<ref name"BBC Boseman">{{cite web|last=Fordyce|first=Tom|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=10 years since Bosman|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Sports, including [[spectator sports]], are popular in EU countries, the most popular being [[Football (soccer)|football]]. [[Cycling]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[field hockey]] are also widely watched and played in the EU. Other sports are favourites in fewer countries, such as [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[motorsports]].

Although it recently launched an anti-doping convention, the European Union plays a minor and mostly indirect role in sport policy. Sports are normally considered to be outside the [[principle of conferral|competences conferred]] by the member states to the European Union. Sports are also organised nationally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally. The European Union does not have specific sports policies. The role of the EU could increase, if (for example) the [[European Constitution]] were to be ratified.

==Education and science==
{{see|Education in the European Union|Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development}}
Both education and science are areas where the individual members hold the legislative powers, and where the EU itself is limited to supporting actions.<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> The activity of the Union in education began cautiously, as pilot actions to help member states develop educational policy in areas of common challenges. It developed in the 1980s into programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the [[ERASMUS programme]], which over its 20-year existence (since 1987) has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Erasmus programme celebrates its 20th aniversary|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> In 1996, the European Year of Lifelong Learning was held, and with this a process to encourage member countries to think together about their education and training strategies. The Erasmus program has now been combined with similar programs for high-school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013]]. The purpose of these exchange and mobility activities is partly to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries, their habits and systems; and partly to spread good practices in the education and training fields. The programme is managed through an Executive Agency<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> and through a series of National Agencies.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Lifelong Learning Programme|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/national_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

Until 2000 and the adoption of the [[Lisbon Strategy]], the EU provided little in the field of direct policy support for education. However, following the conclusions of the [[European Council]] in March 2000,<ref>{{cite web|last=European Council|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Presidency Conclusions, Lisbon European Council|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/00100-r1.en0.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> which invited European Ministers of Education to reflect together on the "concrete objectives of education" and to make recommendations, the [[European Commission]] and member countries have worked together on a substantial programme of joint policy on education, known as "[[Education and Training 2010]]". This program now covers much of the education and training area, and operates in the format of the [[Open Method of Coordination]].<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Education and training 2010, diverse systems, shared goals|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/2010/et_2010_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> 

Activity of the EU in science began in 1984 with the first [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programme]] for scientific research and development. The aims of EU scientific policy may be summarised as coordinating European research policy and those of [[European Union member state|member states]], and using scientific research to stimulate and support other EU policies (such as environmental protection) or activities (such as industrial development and innovation). It has traditionally been carried out by providing funds for open calls for transnational research projects on a wide range of topics selected by the EU. The current Seventh Framework Programme continued these calls for international project, but has also provided funds for the [[European Research Council]], an independent body which allocates research funding without the requirement for trans-nationality.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Research Council: What is the ERC?|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&topicID=12|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

Since January 2000 the [[European Commission]] has set its sights on a wider objective, known as the [[European Research Area]]. This has the support of all member states, and extends the existing financing structure of the frameworks. The research area is based on voluntary participation of individual member states (i.e. it is an [[Open Method of Coordination|open method of coordination]] project). It aims to focus on joint policy development and coordination, agreeing on joint objectives to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and the mobility of researchers between countries, improving the conditions within which researcher careers develop, encouraging links between business and industry and removing among others legal and administrative barriers.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=What is the European Research Area?|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/index_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

In further effort to build a European science base, and to improve the competitive edge of the EU in the area of innovation and technology, the commission has proposed the foundation of a [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]]. Whether this plan will include its own campus, or will be mainly a network of existing research facilities in the EU is not yet decided.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Institute of Technology|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/educ/eit/index_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>
