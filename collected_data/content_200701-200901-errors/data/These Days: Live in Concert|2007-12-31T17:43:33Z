''These Days: Live in Concert'' earned a mixed response from reviewers; some enjoyed the energy and flair of the live performances, while others disliked the lack of dynamism.

==Production==
''These Days: Live in Concert'' was directed by [[Gregor Jordan]],<ref name=CDuniverse>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7521239/a/These+Days:+Powderfinger+Live+In+Concert.htm |title=These Days: Powderfinger Live In Concert - Import DVD|publisher=cdUniverse|accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> who the band had first encountered when he requested they write "[[These Days (Powderfinger song)|These Days]]" for his film ''[[Two Hands]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl22.htm|title=Primed for the P2K tour|publisher=Powderfinger Central|author=Carmine Pascuzzi|date=1999|accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref> [[Bernard Fanning]] also worked with Jordan on the film ''[[Ned Kelly (2003 movie)|Ned Kelly]]'' in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277941/fullcredits|title=Full cast and crew for Ned Kelly|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> The band chose Jordan because they did not want to present ''These Days: Live in Concert'' as "just straight-up live concert footage", but instead wanted to present it from a different angle. Jordan agreed, and believed that the band being a successful rock group from [[Brisbane]] was an interesting angle to work from.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/media/mag/Powderfinger_rollingstone_thosedays.htm|title=Those Days|publisher=Hindley Site|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>

Disc one of ''These Days: Live in Concert'' was recorded by [[Powderfinger]] during sellout performances at [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]], and featured live performances of 14 songs, including nine [[single (music)|singles]].<ref name=ucreview>{{cite web|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/reviews/urpowderfingerthesedaysliveinconcert.html|title=Powderfinger : These Days, Live in Concert|publisher=Undercover|author=Tim Cashmere|date=[[9 September]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> The footage on the disc was shot over two nights.<ref name=CDuniverse /> Disc two, dubbed "low key", was recorded at [[Sydney]]'s [[Fox Studios]]. The disc contained mostly [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] performances by the band, and included a cover of "[[Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)|Inner City Blues]]" by [[Marvin Gaye]].<ref name=ucreview />

The band's live performances at large venues such as the Sydney Entertainment Centre was criticised by some fans, as the band had previously stated they disliked playing to large crowds. [[Drummer]] [[Jon Coghill]] said he was not bothered by the comments, as the band (other than [[guitarist]] [[Ian Haug]]) generally did not take much note of such critique.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/media/mag/Powderfinger_fasterlouder_fingerprintedbypf.htm|title=Be Fingerprinted by Powderfinger|publisher=Hindley Site|work=FasterLouder|author=Elissa|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>
