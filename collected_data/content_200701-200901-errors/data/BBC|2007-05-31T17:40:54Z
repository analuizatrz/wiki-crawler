<!--NOTE: "The" is part of the name; see talk page archive FIVE-->'''The British Broadcasting Corporation''', usually known as the '''BBC''', is the largest [[broadcasting]] corporation in the world in terms of audience numbers, employing 26,000 staff in the [[United Kingdom]] alone and with a budget of more than [[Pound sterling|GBÂ£]]4 billion ([[United States dollar|US$]]7.9 billion).<ref>{{cite book |last=Pharr |first=Susan |coauthors=Krauss, Ellis (eds.) |title=Media and Politics in Japan |year=1996 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |id=ISBN 0824817613 |pages=p.5}}</ref>

Founded in 1922 as the [[British Broadcasting Company|British Broadcasting Company Ltd]], it was subsequently granted a [[Royal Charter]] and made a [[Nationalization|state-owned]] but independent corporation in 1927. The corporation produces programmes and information services, broadcasting globally on [[television]], [[radio]], and the [[Internet]]. The stated mission of the BBC is "to inform, educate and entertain";<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC website: ''About the BBC - Purpose and values'' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/purpose/ |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> [[Coat of arms of the BBC|its motto]] is "Nation Shall Speak Peace Unto Nation".

The BBC is a [[Autonomy|quasi-autonomous]] [[Public company|Public Corporation]] operating as a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcaster]]. The Corporation is run by the [[BBC Trust]]; however, the BBC is, per its charter, to be "free from both political and commercial influence and answers only to its viewers and listeners".<ref name="charter">{{cite web |title=BBC Royal Charter and Agreement |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/charter/ |accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> 

Its domestic programming and broadcasts are primarily funded by levying [[television licence]] fees (under the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act|Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949]]), although money is also raised through commercial activities such as sale of merchandise and programming. The [[BBC World Service]], however, is funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. In order to justify the [[licence fee]], the BBC is expected to produce a number of high-rating shows in addition to programmes that commercial broadcasters would not normally broadcast.<ref name="charter"/>

Domestic audiences often affectionately refer to the BBC as "the [[Beeb]]", a nickname coined by [[Kenny Everett]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/kenny_everett_page.htm | title = Radio Rewind : Kenny Everett | last = Davies | first= Alan | accessdate= 2007-05-10}}</ref> Another nickname, now less commonly used, is "Auntie", said to originate from the old-fashioned "Auntie knows best" attitude<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC Press Release: ''Mark Thompson celebrates the official opening of a new state-of-the art BBC building in Hull'' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/10_october/21/hull.shtml |date=21 October 2004 |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> in the days when [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], the BBC's founder, was in charge. The two nicknames have also been used together as "Auntie Beeb",<ref>{{cite web |title=Times Online: ''Auntie Beeb suffers a relapse'' |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article400120.ece |date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref> and Auntie has been used in [[outtake]]s programmes such as ''Auntie's Big Bloomers''.<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB listing for ''Auntie's Big Bloomers''|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159155/ |accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Bbc logo before 1970.png|thumb|right|The BBC coat of arms]]
{{main|Timeline of the BBC}}
The original ''[[British Broadcasting Company]]'' was founded in 1922 by a group of [[telecommunications]] companies (including [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] of [[General Electric]] and [[AT&T]]) to broadcast experimental radio services. The first transmission was on [[14 November]] of that year, from station 2LO, located at Marconi House, London.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/keydates.shtml | title = BBC Press Office: Key BBC Dates | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref>

The Company, with John Reith as general manager, became the ''British Broadcasting Corporation'' in 1927 when it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] of incorporation and ceased to be privately owned. It started experimental television broadcasting in 1932 using an entirely mechanical 30 line system developed by [[John Logie Baird]]. It became a regular service (known as the [[BBC Television Service]]) in 1936 alternating between a Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic 405 line EMI system.  The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped later that year.  Television broadcasting was suspended from [[1 September]], [[1939]] to [[7 June]], [[1946]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. A widely reported [[urban myth]] is that, upon resumption of service, announcer [[Leslie Mitchell (broadcaster)|Leslie Mitchell]] started by saying, "As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted..." In fact, the first person to appear when transmission resumed was [[Jasmine Bligh]] and the words said were "Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh...?"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff.php | title = Baird: The edit that rewrote history | last = Graham | first = Russ J. | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate = 2006-08-11}}</ref>

The [[European Broadcasting Union]] was formed on 12 February, 1950, in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.

Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955 with the commercially and independently operated [[ITV]]. As a result of the [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Committee]] report of 1962, in which the BBC was lauded and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming,<ref>{{cite web | title = Committees of Enquiry: Pilkington Committee | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/committees_of_enquiry.pdf | pages = p. 4 | date = 1 June 1962| format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-09-30}}</ref> the BBC was awarded a second TV channel, [[BBC2]], in 1964, renaming the existing channel [[BBC1]]. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe.  BBC2 was broadcast in colour from [[1 July]], [[1967]], and was joined by BBC 1 and ITV on [[15 November]], [[1969]].  The 405 line transmissions were continued for compatibility with older television receivers for some years.

In 1974, the BBC's teletext service, [[Ceefax]], was introduced but was not finally transmitted in vision as such until April 1980.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In 1978, the BBC went on strike just before the Christmas of that year, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Since the [[deregulation]] of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster [[Channel 4]]), especially on [[satellite television]], [[cable television]], and [[digital television]] services.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The [[BBC Research Department]] has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques. In the early days it carried out essential research into acoustics and programme level and noise measurement.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The 2004 [[Hutton Inquiry]] and the subsequent Report raised questions about the BBC's journalistic standards and its impartiality. This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, Greg Dyke. In January 2007, the BBC released minutes of the Board meeting which led to Greg Dyke's resignation. Many commentators have considered the discussions documented in the minutes to have made Dyke's ability to remain in position untenable and tantamount to a dismissal.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Unlike the other departments of the BBC, BBC World Service is funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO, is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad.

==Corporation==
===Royal Charter===
The BBC is a [[Autonomy|quasi-autonomous]] [[Public company|Public Corporation]] operating as a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcaster]] incorporated under a Royal Charter that is reviewed every 10 years. Until 2007, the Corporation was run by a board of governors appointed by The Queen or King on the advice of [[government of the United Kingdom|the government]] for a term of four years, but on 1 January, 2007 the Board of Governors was replaced with the [[BBC Trust]]. The BBC is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and to answer only to its viewers and listeners.<ref name="charter" />

The most recent Charter came into effect on 1 January, 2007.<ref name="charter" /> It has created a number of important changes to the Corporation's management and purpose:

* Abolition of the Board of Governors, and their replacement by the [[BBC Trust]].
* A redefinition of the BBC's "public services" (which are considered its prime function):
**Sustaining citizenship and civil society;
**Promoting education and learning;
**Stimulating creativity and cultural excellence;

===Management===
The BBC is a nominally autonomous corporation, independent from direct government intervention, with its activities being overseen by the [[BBC Trust]], formerly the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|Board of Governors]]. General management of the organisation is in the hands of a [[Director-General of the BBC|Director-General]], who is appointed by the Trust.

====BBC Trust====
{{main|BBC Trust}}
The BBC Trust came into effect on 1 January 2007, replacing the Board of Governors.
<blockquote>The BBC Trust works on behalf of licence fee payers: it ensures the BBC provides high quality output and good value for all UK citizens and it protects the independence of the BBC. â BBC Trust<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC Trust | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/ | accessdate = 2007-01-21}}</ref></blockquote>

* [[Diane Coyle]]
* [[Alison Hastings]]
* [[Patricia Hodgson]]

====Revenue ====
{{see also|Television licence|Television licensing in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:BBC income 2004 in GBP Redvers.png|right|325px]]

The principal means of funding the BBC is through the television licence, costing Â£11.37 a month if paid by [[direct debit]] (as of February 2007). Such a licence is required to operate a broadcast [[television]] receiver within the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law. The revenue is collected privately and is paid into the central government Consolidated fund, a process defined in the Communications Act 2003. Funds are then allocated by the DCMS and Treasury and approved by Parliament via the Appropriation Act(s). Additional revenues are paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for over-75's. As the state controls BBC's funding, it is sometimes referred as a "state" broadcaster. 

Income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years.<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Report and Accounts 2004-2005 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/finance/annual_accounts/Annual_Accounts_2004-2005.pdf | author = BBC | format = PDF | pages = p. 94 | accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref> with [[BBC Worldwide]] contributing some Â£145million in cash to the BBC's core public service business.

According to the BBC's 2005-2006 Annual Report,<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Report and Accounts 2005-2006 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/annual_reports_and_reviews/annual_report_and_accounts/BBC_Annual_Report_2005_06.pdf | author = BBC | format = PDF | pages = pp. 103-104 | accessdate = 2007-01-21}}</ref> its income can be broken down as follows: 

* Â£3,100.6 m licence fees collected from consumers.
* Â£620.0 m from BBC Commercial Businesses.
* Â£260.2 m from the World Service, of which Â£239.1 m is from grants (primarily funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office), Â£15.8 m from subscriptions, and Â£5.3 m from other sources.
* Â£24.2 m from other income, such as providing content to overseas broadcasters and concert ticket sales.

====Expenditure====
The BBC gives two forms of expenditure statement for the financial year 2005-2006.

The amount of each licence fee spent monthly<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Report and Accounts 2005-2006 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/annual_reports_and_reviews/annual_report_and_accounts/BBC_Annual_Report_2005_06.pdf | author = BBC | format = PDF | pages = p. 61 | accessdate = 2006-07-07}}</ref> breaks down as follows:

{{main|Broadcasting House}}

Broadcasting House in [[Portland Place]], [[Central London|London]] is the official headquarters of the BBC. It is home to the national radio networks [[BBC Radio 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|3]], [[BBC Radio 4|4]], [[BBC 6 Music|6 Music]], and [[BBC 7]]. On the front of the building are statues of [[Prospero]] and [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] (from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'') sculpted by [[Eric Gill]].

Renovation of Broadcasting House began in 2002 and is scheduled for completion in 2010. As part of a major reorganisation of BBC property, Broadcasting House is to become home to [[BBC News]] (both television and radio), national radio, and the [[BBC World Service]]. The major part of this plan involves the demolition of the two post-war extensions to the building and construction of a new building<ref>{{cite web | title = New Broadcasting House | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/index.shtml | author = BBC | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> beside the existing structure. During the rebuilding process many of the BBC Radio networks have been relocated to other buildings in the vicinity of Portland Place.

In 2007/2008, BBC News is expected to relocate from the News Centre at [[BBC Television Centre]] to the refurbished Broadcasting House in what is being described as "one of the world's largest live broadcast centres".<ref>{{cite web | title = New Broadcasting House - The future | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/thefuture/bh_project.shtml | author = BBC | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref>

By far the largest concentration of BBC staff in the UK exists in [[White City, London|White City]]. Well known buildings in this area include the [[BBC Television Centre]], White City, Media Centre, Broadcast Centre and Centre House.

As well as the various BBC buildings in London, there are major BBC production centres located in [[Cardiff]], [[Belfast]], [[Glasgow]], [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Bristol]], [[Southampton]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Some of these local centres (for example Belfast) are also known as "Broadcasting House" (see [[Broadcasting House (disambiguation)]]). There are also many smaller local and regional studios scattered throughout the UK.

In 2011, the BBC is planning to move several departments of the BBC North. The leading candidate is [[Salford Quays]] in [[Greater Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web | title = MediaCity:UK Chosen as Preferred Site for BBC | url = http://www.mediacityuk.co.uk/pr_preferred.html | author = MediaCity:UK | date = 15 June 2006 | accessdate = 2007-01-20}}</ref> This will mark a major decentralisation of the corporation's operations from London.

Ratings figures suggest that during major crises such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States]], the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] or a Royal Funeral, the UK audience overwhelmingly turns to the BBC's coverage as opposed to its commercial rivals.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Cozens | first = Claire  | title = BBC news ratings double | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 8 July 2005 | url = http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,1524235,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-25 }}</ref>

On  [[7 July]] [[2005]], [[7 July 2005 London bombings|the day that there were a series of coordinated bomb blasts on London's public transport system]], the [[bbc.co.uk]] website recorded an all time [[bandwidth]] peak of 11&nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s at 12:00 on [[7 July]]. [[BBC News]] received some 1 billion total hits on the day of the event (including all images, text and [[HTML]]), serving some 5.5 [[terabyte]]s of data. At peak times during the day there were 40,000 page requests per second for the BBC News website. The previous day's announcement of the [[2012 Olympics]] being awarded to London caused a peak of around 5&nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s. The previous all time high at [[bbc.co.uk]] was caused by the announcement of the [[Michael Jackson]] verdict, which used 7.2&nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s.<ref>{{cite web | title = Statistics on BBC Webservers 7th July 2005 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback/07July_Statistics.shtml | author = BBC | accessdate = 2006-11-13}}</ref>

===Radio===
{{further|[[BBC Radio]], [[BBC Local Radio]]}}
The BBC has five major national stations, [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] ("the best new music and entertainment"), [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] (the UK's most listened to radio station, with 12.9 million weekly listeners<ref>{{cite web | title = Quarterly Summary of Radio Listening - Quarter 1 2006 - National Stations | url = http://www.rajar.co.uk/quarterlysummary/qstsvfiles/135/Q12006National.pdf | author = RAJAR | authorlink = RAJAR | format = PDF | date = 11 May 2006 | accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref>), [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] (specialist-interest music such as classical, world, arts, drama and jazz), [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] (current affairs, drama and comedy), and [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] (24 hour news, sports and talk).

In recent years some further national stations have been introduced on [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|digital radio platforms]] including [[BBC Five Live Sports Extra|Five Live Sports Extra]] (a companion to Five Live for additional events coverage), [[BBC 1Xtra|1Xtra]] (for black, urban and gospel music), [[BBC 6 Music|6 Music]] (less [[mainstream]] genres of music), [[BBC 7]] (Comedy, Drama & Kids shows) and [[BBC Asian Network]] ([[British Asian|British South Asian]] talk, music and news in English and in many South Asian languages), a station which had evolved from BBC Local Radio origins in the 1970s and still is broadcast on Medium Wave frequencies in some parts of England.  In addition the BBC World Service is now also broadcast nationally in the UK on DAB.

There is also a network of [[BBC Local Radio|local stations]] with a mixture of talk, news and music in [[England]] and the [[Channel Islands]] as well as national stations (Nations' radio) of [[BBC Radio Wales]], [[BBC Radio Cymru]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), [[BBC Radio Scotland]], [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]] (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scots Gaelic]]), [[BBC Radio Ulster]], and [[BBC Radio Foyle]].

For a world-wide audience, the BBC produces the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] funded [[BBC World Service]], which is broadcast worldwide on [[shortwave]] radio, and on DAB Digital Radio in the UK. The World Service is a major source of news and information programming and can be received in 150 capital cities worldwide, with a weekly audience estimate of 163 million listeners worldwide. The Service currently broadcasts in 33 languages and dialects (including English), though not all languages are broadcast in all areas.<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Review 2005-2006: A year in brief | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/us/annual_review/2005/year_in_brief.shtml | author = BBC World Service | authorlink = BBC World Service | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-01-21}}</ref>

In 2005, the BBC announced that it would substantially reduce its radio broadcasting in [[Eastern Europe]]an languages and divert resources instead to a new [[Arabic language]] satellite TV broadcasting station (including radio and online content) in the [[Middle East]] to be launched in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC Arabic TV appoints former Al Jazeera employee as news editor | url = http://www.metimes.com/articles/normal.php?StoryID=20060315-071402-4650r | author = Middle East Times | authorlink = Middle East Times | date = 15 March 2006 | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref>

Since 1943, the BBC has also provided radio programming to the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], which broadcasts in countries where British troops are stationed.

All of the national, local, and regional BBC radio stations, as well as the BBC World Service, are available over the [[Internet]] in the [[RealAudio]] [[Streaming media|streaming]] format. In April 2005, the BBC began trials offering a limited number of radio programmes as [[podcasting|podcasts]].<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/04_april/14/pod.shtml | title = BBC press release: ''BBC to podcast up to 20 more programmes including Today and Radio 1 speech highlights'' | date = 14 April 2005 | accessdate= 2006-07-13}}</ref>

Historically, the BBC was the only radio broadcaster in the UK until 1967, when [[URY|University Radio York (URY)]], then under the name ''Radio York'', was launched as the first (and now oldest) legal independent radio station in the country.

===Television===
{{main|BBC Television}}
[[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] are the BBC's flagship television channels. The BBC is also promoting the new channels [[BBC Three]] and [[BBC Four]], which are only available via [[digital television]] equipment (now in widespread use in the UK, with analogue transmission being phased out from October 2007<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC News Report | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6453087.stm | date = 15 March 2007 | accessdate = 2007-03-15}}</ref>). The BBC also runs [[BBC News 24]], [[BBC Parliament]], and two children's channels, [[CBBC Channel|CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]], on digital. 

BBC One is a regionalised TV service which provides opt-outs throughout the day for local news and other local programming. In the [[Republic of Ireland]] the [[BBC Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] regionalised BBC One & BBC Two are available via analogue transmissions deflecting signals from the North and also carried out on [[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky Digital]], [[UPC Ireland]].

From [[June 9]], [[2006]], the BBC began a 6-12 month trial of [[High-definition television]] broadcasts under the name [[BBC HD]]. The corporation has been producing programmes in the format for many years, and states that it hopes to produce 100% of new programmes in HDTV by 2010.<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC Press Release: ''BBC to trial High Definition broadcasts in 2006'' | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/08/hdtv.shtml | date = 8 November 2005 | accessdate= 2006-07-07}}</ref>

Since 1975, the BBC has also provided its TV programmes to the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] (BFBS), allowing members of [[Military of the United Kingdom|HM Forces]] serving all over the world to watch and listen to their favourite programmes from home on two dedicated TV channels.

===Internet===
{{main|bbc.co.uk}}
The bbc.co.uk [http://www.bbc.co.uk/] [[website]], formerly known as BBCi and before that BBC Online, includes a comprehensive, advertisement-free [[BBC News Online|news website]] and archive. The BBC claims the site to be "Europe's most popular content-based site"<ref>{{cite web | title = bbc.co.uk Commissioning | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/newmedia/websites.shtml | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> and boasts that 13.2 million people in the UK visit the site's more than 2 million pages.<ref>{{cite web | title = bbc.co.uk Key Facts | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/website.shtml | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> According to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa's]] TrafficRank system, in May 2007 bbc.co.uk was the 20th most popular [[English Language]] website in the world,<ref>{{cite web | title = Top English-language Sites | url=http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode=lang&lang=en | author = Alexa | authorlink = Alexa Internet | accessdate= 2007-03-12}}</ref> and the 33rd most popular overall.<ref>{{cite web | title = Global Top 500 Sites | url = http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode=global&lang=none | author = Alexa | authorlink = Alexa Internet | accessdate= 2007-03-12}}</ref>

The website allows the BBC to produce sections which complement the various programmes on television and radio, and it is common for viewers and listeners to be told [[Uniform Resource Locator|website addresses]] for the bbc.co.uk sections relating to that programme. The site also allows users to listen to most Radio output live and for seven days after broadcast using its [[RealPlayer]]-based "Radio Player"; some TV content is also distributed in [[RealVideo]] format. A new system known as [[Intergrated Media Player|IPlayer]] is  under development, which uses [[peer-to-peer]] and [[Digital rights management|DRM]] technology to deliver both radio and TV content for offline use for up to 7 days. Also, through participation in the [[Creative Archive Licence]] group, bbc.co.uk allowed legal downloads of selected archive material via the internet.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/03/archive.shtml | title = BBC press release: ''BBC News opens its archives for the first time'' | date = 3 January 2006 | accessdate= 2006-10-03}}</ref>

[[BBC jam]] is a free online service, delivered through broadband and narrowband connections, providing high-quality interactive resources designed to stimulate learning at home and at school. Initial content was made available in January 2006.  BBC jam was suspended on 20th March 2007.

In recent years some major on-line companies and politicians have complained that the bbc.co.uk website receives too much funding from the television licence, meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on bbc.co.uk.<ref>{{cite web | title = Department of Culture, Media and Sport: Independent Review of BBC Online, pp41-58 | url = http://www.culture.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/45F9953F-CE61-4325-BEA6-400DF9722494/0/BBCOnlinereview.pdf | last = Graf | first = Philip | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> Some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on bbc.co.uk should be reduced &mdash; either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions, or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site.<ref>{{cite web | author = British Internet Publishers Alliance | title = BIPA Response to Review of the BBCâs Royal Charter | url = http://www.bipa.co.uk/getArticle.php?ID=325 | date = 31 May 2005 | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> In response to this the BBC carried out an investigation, and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services. bbc.co.uk will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market, but will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision. (For example, instead of providing local events information and timetables, users will be guided to outside websites already providing that information.)
Part of this plan included the BBC closing some of its websites, and rediverting money to redevelop other parts.<ref>{{cite news | title = Public value key to BBC websites | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3992875.stm | date = 8 November 2004 | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> More recent information on web plans at [http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1219009.ece]

===Interactive television===
{{main|BBCi}}
BBCi is the brand name for the BBC's [[Interactive television|interactive]] [[digital television]] services, which are available through [[Freeview]] (digital terrestrial), as well as [[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky Digital]] (satellite), and [[Virgin Media]] (cable). Unlike [[Ceefax]], BBCi is able to display full-colour graphics, photographs, and video, as well as programmes. Recent examples include the interactive sports coverage for [[football (soccer)|football]] and [[rugby football]] matches, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415069/ BBC Soundbites] which starred young actress [[Jennifer Lynn]] and an interactive national IQ test, [[Test the Nation]]. All of the BBC's digital television stations, (and radio stations on [[Freeview]]), allow access to the BBCi service.

BBCi provides viewers with over 100 interactive TV programmes every year, as well as the 24/7 service.<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC Press Office: BBCi Key Facts | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/bbci.shtml | accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref> It also offers video news and weather.

===Commercial services===
[[BBC Worldwide]] Limited is the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC responsible for the commercial exploitation of BBC programmes and other properties, including a number of television stations throughout the world. The cable and satellite stations [[BBC Prime]] (in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] the [[Middle East]], and [[Asia]]), [[BBC America]], [[BBC Canada]] (alongside [[BBC Kids]]), broadcast popular BBC programmes to people outside the UK, as does [[UK.TV]] (co-run with [[Foxtel]] and Fremantle Media) in [[Australasia]]. A similar service, [[BBC Japan]], ceased broadcasts in April 2006 after its [[Japan]]ese distributor folded.<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC Japan website | url=http://www.bbcjapan.tv/news.aspx?menu=news|accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref>  BBC Worldwide also runs a 24-hour news channel, [[BBC World]] and co-runs, with [[Virgin Media]], the [[UKTV]] network of stations in the UK, producers of amongst others [[UKTV Gold]]. In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many [[Public Broadcasting Service]] stations in the [[United States]], as do reruns of BBC programmes such as ''[[EastEnders]]'', and in [[New Zealand]] on [[TV ONE|TV One]].

Many BBC programmes (especially [[Documentary film|documentaries]]) are sold via BBC Worldwide to foreign television stations, and [[comedy]], [[documentary film|documentaries]] and [[Costume drama|historical drama]] productions are popular on the international DVD market.<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Review 2006 | url = http://www.bbcworldwide.com/annualreviews/review2006/BBCWWAnnual%20Review2006.pdf | author = BBC Worldwide | authorlink = BBC Worldwide | format = PDF | accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref> 

BBC Worldwide also maintains the publishing arm of the BBC and it is the third-largest publisher of consumer magazines in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Review 2001 | url = http://www.bbcworldwide.com/annualreviews/review2001/magazines2.html | author = BBC Worldwide | authorlink = BBC Worldwide | accessdate = 2006-07-14}}</ref> BBC Magazines, formerly known as BBC Publications, publishes the ''[[Radio Times]]'' (and published the now-defunct ''[[The Listener]]'') as well as a number of magazines that support BBC programming such as ''[[Top Gear (magazine)|BBC Top Gear]]'', ''[[BBC Good Food]]'', ''[[The Sky at Night|BBC Sky at Night]]'', ''[[BBC History]]'', ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' and ''[[BBC Music]]''.

The BBC has traditionally played a major role in producing book and music tie-ins with its broadcast material. [[BBC Records]] produced soundtrack albums, talking books and material from radio broadcasts of music. 

Between 2004 and 2006, BBC Worldwide owned the independent magazine publisher Origin Publishing.<ref>{{cite web | title=Origin Publishing | url=http://www.originpublishing.co.uk/ | accessdate= 2006-12-31}}</ref>

BBC Worldwide also licences and directly sells [[DVD]] and audio recordings of popular programmes to the public, most notably ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (including books and merchandise), and archive [[classical music]] recordings, initially as ''BBC Radio Classics'' and then ''BBC Legends''.

===Miscellaneous===
The BBC and  the Foreign and Commonwealth Office jointly run [[BBC Monitoring]], which monitors radio, television, the press and the internet worldwide.

==Unions==
Union membership is a private matter between staff and their chosen union: staff are not automatically covered by a union, but since the BBC is a large employer (in the media sector), membership numbers are considerable.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Staff at the BBC are normally represented by [[BECTU]], along with journalistic staff by the [[National Union of Journalists|NUJ]] and electrical staff by [[Amicus]]. Union membership is optional, and paid for by staff members and not by the BBC.

==Cultural significance==
The BBC was the only television broadcaster in the United Kingdom until 1955 and the only legal radio broadcaster until 1973.  Its cultural impact was therefore significant since the country had no choice for its information and entertainment from these two powerful media.  

Even after the advent of commercial television and radio, the BBC has remained one of the main elements in British in popular culture through its obligation to produce TV and radio programmes for the mass audiences.  However the arrival of BBC2 allowed the BBC also to make programmes for minority interests in drama, documentaries, current affairs, entertainment and sport. Examples are cited such as ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'', ''[[Civilisation (TV programme)|Civilisation]]'', ''[[Tonight (1957 TV series)|Tonight]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', and ''[[Pot Black]]'', but many other ground-breaking examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the BBC's entries in the [[British Film Institute]]'s 2000 list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]].<ref name="tv100">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php|title=The BFI TV 100: 1-100|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=2000|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> In radio the BBC has also maintained a high standard of news, drama, entertainment, documentaries, sport and music for all tastes, and still draws large audiences, while also serving minority tastes. 

The BBC's objective of providing a service to the public, rather than just entertainment, has changed the public's perception in a wide range of subjects from health to natural history. By maintaining a high standard the BBC also defined a quality threshold that the commercial companies had to reach to retain their licences but the advent of the multi-channel age is lessening this effect.  The export of BBC programmes, the [[BBC World Service]] and [[BBC World]] have meant that the cultural impact of the BBC has been also experienced world-wide. 

Although the BBC has changed society, the society has also changed the BBC. The term [[BBC English]] (Received Pronunciation) refers to the former use of [[Standard English]] with this accent.  However the organisation now makes more use of [[Regional accents of English speakers|regional accents]] in order to reflect the diversity of the UK, though clarity and fluency are still expected of presenters. From its 'starchy' beginnings, the BBC has also become more inclusive, and now accommodates the interests of all strata of society and all minorities, because they all pay the licence fee. The BBC therefore plays a major role in maintaining a cohesive society.

Competition from [[ITV|Independent Television]], [[Channel 4]], [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]] and other broadcast television stations, has slightly lessened the BBC's reach, but nevertheless it remains major influence on British popular culture. Many popular everyday sayings are derived from BBC-produced television shows.

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of the BBC}}
Historically, the BBC has been subject to continuing criticism for various policies or perceived biases since its inception.<ref>Burns, Tom; quoted in ''[http://www.microform.co.uk/guides/R97602.pdf BBC Handbooks, Accounts and Annual Reports, 2+38-2001/2]'' Chignell, Hugh; Bournemouth University, undated.

Richard Porter, head of News, BBC World, recently reported they "no longer have the original tapes" of the BBC World version of their 9/11 coverage.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/richard_porter/ | title = "We no longer have the original tapes of our 9/11 coverage" | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 27 February 2007 | accessdate = 2006-03-01}}</ref>.
