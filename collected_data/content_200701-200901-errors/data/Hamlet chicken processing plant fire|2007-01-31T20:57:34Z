The '''1991 Hamlet chicken plant fire''' took place at the [[Imperial Foods]] chicken processing plant in [[Hamlet, North Carolina]], [[United States|U.S.]], on [[September 3]], [[1991]]. Twenty-five people were killed and fifty-six injured after being trapped behind locked fire doors.

==Background==
The building was eleven years old. Originally an [[ice cream]] factory, the building was 30,000 square-[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] in size, and was actually a series of adjoining structures.<ref name="UnitVII">[http://www.eduref.org/Virtual/Lessons/crossroads/sec4/Unit_7/Unit_VIIQ10R3.html Describe the working conditions in factories in the late 19th century - Imperial Foods Company Reading] - eduref.org - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref> The interior was a "maze of large rooms separated by moveable walls". Both workers and the product moved around the interior from process to process, going from front to rear.<ref name="UnitVII"/> Imperial's owners usually kept the doors of the chicken plant padlocked and the windows boarded-up.<ref name="Organica">[http://www.organicanews.com/news/article.cfm?story_id=103 Hamlet: the Untold Tragedy] - Organica News - Obtained January 29, 2007.</ref> This was done to prevent people from stealing chickens, vandalising the premises and/or committing other petty criminal acts - a decision that was to later have fatal consequences. There had been no safety inspections by the state due to a lack of inspectors.<ref name="emergency.com"/> However, the poultry inspector had visited the site daily, and was aware of the various fire violations as well as the fact that much of the chicken meat was found to be rotten, and that the reason it was processed into [[chicken nuggets]] was to disguise the foul taste. However, for unknown reasons, he did not report these violations.<ref name="Organica"/><ref name="chicken nuggets">[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0203/p02s01-usgn.html Lessons from a factory fire] - The Christian Science monitor - Obtained January 30, 2007.</ref> The factory had had three previous non-fatal fires, but despite this, no action was taken to prevent recurrence or to unlock the doors.<ref name="Organica"/>

==Fire==
The fire began when a twenty-five [[foot (unit of length)|foot]] long fryer [[vat]] aparantly [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously ignited]] at around 8:30 AM.<ref name="emergency.com">[http://www.emergency.com/nc-fire.htm FIRE VIOLATIONS KILL TWENTY-FIVE IN CHICKEN PLANT] - emergency.com - Obtained on January 18 2007.</ref> There were ninety employees in the facility at the time. There were no [[sprinkler]]s in the building,<ref name="Organica"/> so the fire spread rapidly, causing trauma-related injuries to some of the survivors as they rushed to escape.<ref name="emergency.com"/> Large quantities of thick, acrid smoke was produced by a combination of burning [[soybean oil]] and chicken, and melting insulation. The facility also contained a quantity of [[asbestos]].<ref name="Organica"/>

Workers attempted to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; casualties were high, with twenty-five fatalities; in addition, fifty-six people received injuries such as severe [[burns]], [[blindness]], respiratory disease from [[smoke inhalation]], [[neurology|neurological]] and [[brain damage]], and [[post traumatic stress disorder]].<ref name="emergency.com"/><ref name="Organica"/> Those who were able to escape worked in the front of the building, and escaped through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke.<ref name="UnitVII"/> The injured were sent to several different hospitals for treatment for their injuries.

==Emergency response==
Over 100 medical and emergency service personnel attended the scene.<ref name="emergency.com"/> The emergency response has, however, come under heavy criticism in the aftermath of the blaze. Fire Chief Fuller, in charge of the emergency response, refused help several times from nearby Dobbins Heights fire department, located just five minutes drive away. The department was comprised of [[African-American]] [[Volunteer fire department|volunteers]], and there have been allegations that there was racial prejudice on the part of the Fire Chief, especially since the workers were also of an ethnic minority.<ref name="Organica"/> However, Fuller has defended his decision, saying at the time he refused assistance he did not realise the doors were locked, and adding "In a fire like this you need good, seasoned people."<ref name="Organica"/> Witnesses have also said that there were only two oxygen tanks on site, hopelessly inadequate for the large number of casualties.<ref name="Organica"/>

==Immediate aftermath==
It was immediately clear that the workers had been trapped by locked fire doors, garnering much controversy. A spokesman for the company admitted that "certain doors" in the plant were locked at "certain times", but refused to elaborate on which doors.<ref name="emergency.com"/> Clark Staten, of the [[Emergency Response and Research Institute]] in [[Chicago]] said in response to the blaze, "If the initial reports can be believed, this is an intolerable set of circumstances that should result in criminal charges being placed against those responsible for having the fire doors locked... Our past experience with fires and fire deaths shows that we must ensure an adequate number of open exits from any occupied building...It's hard to believe, in today's day and age that any business owner or manager would be so insensitive to fire safety as to allow this sort of incident to happen."<ref name="emergency.com"/>

==Investigation==  
Investigators found indentations left on at least one door by people attempting to kick it down.<ref name="emergency.com"/> They also discovered concentrations of bodies around [[fire exits]].<ref name="emergency.com"/> There was also a concentration inside two large [[walk in freezer]]s, where panicked workers had sought shelter. Ironically, dressed for the heat of summer, they instead quickly froze to death, in temperatures as low as minus 28 degrees.<ref name="UnitVII"/> They concluded that the high number of deaths and injuries were caused by the locked fire doors. The cause of the fire itself was found to be in a leak in a [[hydraulic]] line serving a [[conveyer belt]]. The [[hydraulic fluid]] from the leak was then ignited inside the gas-fired fryer.<ref name="VA-Pilot">[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950126/01260568.htm OWNER OF HAMLET PLANT IS UP FOR PAROLE] - scholar.lib.vt.edu (originally published by Knight-Rider Newspapers) - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref>

==Criminal prosecution==
Emmett J. Roe, owner of Imperial Foods Products inc., his son Brad, who was operations manager for the company, and plant manager James N. Hair all surrendered to face prosecution on [[March 13]] [[1992]], and were charged with non-negligent [[manslaughter]].<ref name="NYT2">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDE1731F930A25750C0A964958260 3 Surrender in Plant Fire] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref> There was no trial. Instead, on [[September 15]], [[1992]] Owner Roe senior pleaded guilty to 25 counts of involountary manslaughter, while his son and another man went free as part of a [[plea bargain]] agreement. It was Roe who had personally ordered the doors to be locked from the outside.<ref name="VA-Pilot"/> He received a prison sentance of 19 years and 11 months.<ref name="prosecution">Henry, Stuart; Mark M. Lanier (1998). Essential Criminology, p. 1.</ref><ref name="Organica"/><ref name="NYT">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10610F63C550C768DDDA00894DA494D81&showabstract=1 Meat-Plant Owner Pleads Guilty In a Blaze That Killed 25 People] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref><ref name="VA-Pilot"/> The sentance is unpopular among many of the workers and their families, who point out that it amounts to less than a year for each dead person.<ref name="VA-Pilot"/> He first became elegible for [[parole]] in [[March 1994]], and will become elegible again every year, another fact unpopular with victims of the disaster.<ref name="VA-Pilot"/>

===References as a textbook example===

The disaster and subsequent prosecution have been used as textbook cases. One such book states:
<blockquote>
...the case of the Imperial chicken plant in Hamlet, North Carolina, where twenty-five deaths occurred when the factory caught fire. Imperial's owners had padlocked the plant's fire exits to stop petty pilfering of chicken; each of the owners received a ten-year prison sentence for non-negligent manslaughter. -''Henry, Stuart; Mark M. Lanier ([[1998]]). ''[[Essential Criminology]]'', p. 1.''</blockquote>

==Long-term aftermath==
After the fire, the factory was permanently closed, with the loss of 215 jobs.<ref name="VA-Pilot"/> Within two years of the accident, [[Insurance company|insurance companies]] and the North Carolina [[business lobby]] collaboratively introduced legislation to severely limit the compensation available to injured workers and the relatives of the deceased.<ref name="Organica"/> Insurance companies had originally agreed to pay $16.1 million to the injured and the families of the deceased.<ref name="$16.1 million">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616FF3B590C7B8CDDA80994DA494D81 Victims of Poultry-Plant Fire to Get $16.1 Million] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref> Some of the workers became activists as a result, to fight what they see as "bureaucratic injustice." They had originally hired [[John Coale]], an attorney who had worked on the [[Bhopal disaster]], but he could not legally practice in NC.<ref name="Organica"/>
