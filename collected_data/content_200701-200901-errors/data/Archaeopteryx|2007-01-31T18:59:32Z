'''''Archaeopteryx''''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] αρχαιος ''archaios'' meaning 'ancient' and πτερυξ ''pteryx'' meaning 'feather' or 'wing'<ref>
It appears as if the ambiguity of the Ancient Greek πτερυξ was realized by von Meyer. At the time of the original description, he referred to a single feather which appeared like a modern bird's [[remiges|remix]] (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the London specimen, to which he referred to as a "''Skelet eines mit Federn bedeckten Thiers''" ("skeleton of an animal covered in feathers"). In [[German language|German]], this ambiguity is amply resolved by the term ''Schwinge'' which confers exactly the same ambiguity as πτερυξ  - ''Urschwinge'' was the favored translation of ''Archaeopteryx'' among German scholars in the late [[19th century]]; in English, "ancient pinion" would be the best possible approximation.</ref>; pronounced {{IPA|/ɑː(ɹ)kiːˈɒptəˌɹɪks/}}), from the late [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] ([[Kimmeridgian]] stage, 155-150 million years ago) of what is now [[Germany]], is the earliest and most primitive known [[Aves|avian]]. ''Archaeopteryx'' was similar in size and shape to a [[magpie]], with broad, rounded wings and a long tail, and reached up to 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) in length. Its [[feather]]s resembled those of modern birds but ''Archaeopteryx'' was rather different from any bird known today, in that it had jaws lined with sharp teeth, three 'fingers' ending in curved [[claw]]s and a long bony tail. In 1862, the description of the first intact specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'', just two years after [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', set off a firestorm of debate about [[evolution]] and the role of [[transitional fossil]]s that endures to this day.  

== ''Archaeopteryx'' and the origins of birds ==
In the 1970s, [[John Ostrom]] argued that the birds evolved from [[theropoda|theropod dinosaurs]] (see [[Dinosaur-bird connection]]). ''Archaeopteryx'' provides a critical piece of this argument, as it preserves a number of avian features (a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, a partially reversed first toe) and a number of dinosaur and theropod features (for instance, a long ascending process of the [[astragalus]], [[interdental plate]]s, an [[obturator]] process of the [[ischium]], and long chevrons in the tail). In particular, Ostrom found that ''Archaeopteryx'' was remarkably similar to the theropod family [[Dromaeosauridae]]. Further research on dinosaurs from the Gobi Desert and China has since provided more evidence of a link between ''Archaeopteryx'' and the dinosaurs, such as Chinese [[feathered dinosaurs]].  

''Archaeopteryx'' is probably close to the ancestry of modern birds - it shows most of the features one would expect in an ancestral bird - but it may not be the direct ancestor of living birds, and it is arguable how much divergence was already present in the early birds at its time.

==Plumage==
''Archaeopteryx'' specimens were most notable for their well-developed [[remiges]] (flight feathers). These are markedly asymmetrical and show the structure of flight feathers of modern birds, with vanes given stability by a [[barb (feather)|barb]]-[[barbule]]-barbicel arrangement. The tail feathers are less asymmetrical, again in line with the situation in modern birds, and also have firm vanes. The [[thumb]] did not bear a separately movable tuft of stiff feathers ([[alula]]) yet.

Body plumage is less well documented, and only properly researched in the well-preserved Berlin specimen. Thus, as more than one species seems to be involved, the following does not necessarily hold true for all of them. In the Berlin specimen, there are "trousers" of well-developed feathers on the legs; some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure but are somewhat decomposed (i.e., lack barbicels as in [[ratite]]s: Christiansen & Bonde, 2004), but at least in part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight (Longrich, 2006).

There was a patch of [[pennaceous feather]]s running along the back which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm (though not as stiff as the flight-related feathers). Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of "proto-[[down feathers|down]]" not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur ''[[Sinosauropteryx]]'', being decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appeared more like fur than like feathers in life (though not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body, as far as such structures are both preserved and not obliterated by preparation, and the lower neck (Christiansen & Bonde, 2004).

On the other hand, there is no indication of feathering on the upper neck and head; while these may conceivably have been nude as in many closely related feathered dinosaurs for which good specimens are available, this may still be an artifact of preservation: it appears that most ''Archaeopteryx'' specimens became embedded in [[Oxygen saturation|anoxic]] sediment after drifting some time on their back in the sea - the head and neck and the tail are generally bent downwards which suggests that the specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin was already softened and loose (further evidence is provided by the fact that in some specimens, the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment), and in specimens moving along the ground in shallow water, this would cause the head and upper neck, but not the more firmly attached tail feathers to slough off (Elżanowski, 2002).

It must be mentioned that the feather, the initial specimen described, does not agree too well with the flight-related feathers of ''Archaeopteryx''. It certainly is a remix of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it probably belongs to an as of yet undiscovered species of primitive bird or possibly bird-like dinosaur. As the feather was the original [[type specimen]], this has created quite some [[zoological nomenclature|nomenclatorial]] confusion.

==Flight ability==<!-- 2004 review by U. Lindhe Norberg, Acta Zool Sin 50:921 -->
The flight feathers of ''Archaeopteryx'' were highly asymmetrical, as in the wings of modern birds, and the tail feathers are rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but it is unclear whether ''Archaeopteryx'' was simply a glider, or capable of flapping flight. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that ''Archaeopteryx'' was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike [[coracoid]]s, or perhaps to a [[cartilage|cartilagenous]] [[sternum]]. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between [[scapula]], [[coracoid]] and [[humerus]] - instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds - suggests that ''Archaeopteryx'' was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. Thus, it seems likely that ''Archaeopteryx'' was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have utilized a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique (Senter, 2006).

''Archaeopteryx'' wings were relatively large, which would have resulted in a low stall speed and reduced turning radius. The short and rounded shape of the wings would have increased drag, but could also have improved ''Archaeopteryx''' ability to fly through cluttered environments such as trees and brush (similar wing shapes are seen in birds which fly through trees and brush, such as crows and pheasants). The presence of "hind wings", asymmetrical flight feathers stemming from the legs similar to those seen in dromaeosaurids such as ''[[Microraptor]]'', would also have added to the aerial mobility of ''Archaeopteryx''. The first detailed study of the hind wings by Longrich (2006) suggested that the structures formed up to 12% of the total [[airfoil]]. Considering that it is not certain to what extent such feathers capable of supporting flight were present on the legs, this would have reduced stall speed by up to 6% and turning radius by up to 12%, in addition to the stall and turning radius reduction provided by the primary wing and tail feathers.

In 2004, scientists analyzing a detailed [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] of ''Archaeopteryx'''s [[braincase]], concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination (Winter, 2004). The skull scan also revealed the structure of the inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that ''Archaeopteryx'' had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception and coordination needed to fly (Alnso ''et al.'', 2004).

''Archaeopteryx'' continues to play an important part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds. Some scientists see ''Archaeopteryx'' as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the "trees down" hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by [[O.C. Marsh]]). Other scientists see ''Archaeopteryx'' as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the "ground up" hypothesis proposed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]]). Still others suggest that ''Archaeopteryx'' might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground, like modern crows, and this latter view is what today is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that it was a species which was neither particularly specialized for running on the ground, nor for perching. Considering the current knowledge of flight-related morphology, a scenario as outlined by Elżanowski (2002), namely that ''Archaeopteryx'' used its wings mainly to escape [[predator (biology)|predator]]s by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, and alternatively to cover longer distances by (mainly) gliding down from cliffs or treetops, appears quite reasonable.

Given that it is now well established that several lineages of theropods evolved feathers and flight independently, the question of how precisely the ancestors of ''Archaeopteryx'' became able to fly has lost dramatically in importance for the time being. Since it is quite likely that this species belongs to a lineage of birds unrelated to the [[Neornithes]] (the Jurassic ancestor of which remains unknown), how exactly flying ability was gained in ''Archaeopteryx'' may be a moot point, having little bearing on how this happened in the ancestors of modern birds.

==Taxonomy==
The relationships of the  specimens are problematic. Most specimens have been given their own species at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as ''Archaeornis siemensii'', the Eichstätt specimen as ''Jurapteryx recurva'', the Munich specimen as ''Archaeopteryx bavarica'' and the Solnhofen specimen was designated as ''Wellnhoferia grandis''. 

Recently, it has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species (''[[New Scientist]]'', 17 April 2004, p.17). However, significant differences exist among the specimens. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts, lined with forward-pointing teeth and possible presence of a sternum. These differences are as large as or larger than the differences seen today between adults of different bird species. However, it is also possible that these differences could be explained by different ages of the living birds.

==Fossils==
Over the years, ten body fossil specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' and a feather that may belong to it have been found. All of the fossils come from the [[limestone]] deposits near [[Solnhofen]], [[Germany]]. [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1201_051201_archaeopteryx.html]
'''The feather:''' Discovered in 1860 near [[Solnhofen]], Germany, and described in 1861 by [[Hermann von Meyer]]. Currently located at the [[Humboldt Museum|Humbolt Museum für Naturkunde]] in [[Berlin]]. This is generally referred to ''Archaeopteryx'' and was the initial [[holotype]], but whether it actually is a feather of this species or another, as yet undiscovered, proto-bird is unknown. There are some indications it is indeed not from the same animal as most of the skeletons (the "typical" ''A. lithographica'') (Griffiths, 1996). [[Image:SArchaeopteryxLondon.jpg|thumb|left|The London Archaeopteryx, 1863, detail, note the feathers]]
# '''London Specimen''' (BMNH 37001<!--, the [[Type (zoology)|type]] specimen-->): Discovered in 1861 near [[Langenaltheim]], Germany and described in 1863 by [[Richard Owen]] as ''Archaeopteryx macrura'', assuming it did not belong to the same species as the feather. Currently located at the [[British Museum of Natural History]] in [[London]], it is missing its head.<!-- However, this skeleton is the designated [[type specimen]], as the 1860-61 feather cannot be identified as to species. --> In a subsequent edition of his ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (chap. 10, pp.335-336), [[Charles Darwin]] acclaimed Owen's discovery as [[transitional fossil|link]]ing lizard-like [[reptile]]s with modern [[bird]]s. [[Image:SArchaeopteryxBerlin2.jpg|thumb|right|The Berlin Archaeopteryx, 1881]]
# '''Berlin Specimen''' (HMN 1880): Discovered in 1876 or 1877 on the [[Blumenberg]] near [[Eichstätt]], Germany, by Jakob Niemeyer. He exchanged this precious [[fossil]] for a cow, with Johann Dörr. It was described in 1884 by [[Wilhelm Dames]]. Currently Located at the Humbolt Museum für Naturkunde, it is the best specimen, and the first with a complete head. Once classified as a new species, ''A. siemensii'', but a recent evaluation supports the ''A. siemensii'' species definition  [Elzanowski, 2002].
# '''Maxberg Specimen''' (S5): Discovered in 1956 or 1958 near Langenaltheim and described in 1959 by [[Heller]]. Currently missing, though it was once exhibited at the [[Maxberg Museum]] in Solnhofen. It belonged to [[Eduard Opitsch]], who loaned it to the museum. After his death in 1991, the specimen was discovered to be missing and may have been stolen or sold. It is composed of a torso.
# '''Haarlem Specimen''' (TM 6428, also known as the ''Teyler Specimen''): Discovered in 1855 near [[Riedenburg]], Germany and described as a ''[[Pterodactylus]] crassipes'' in 1875 by von Meyer, it was reclassified in 1970 by [[John Ostrom]]. Currently located at the [[Teyler Museum]] in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands. It was the very first specimen, despite the classification error.
# '''Eichstätt Specimen''' (JM 2257): Discovered in 1951 or 1955 near [[Workerszell]], Germany and described by [[Peter Wellnhofer]] in 1974. Currently located at the [[Jura Museum]] in [[Eichstätt]], Germany. It is the smallest specimen and has the second best head. Possibly a separate genus, ''Jurapteryx recurva'' or species ''A. recurva''. [[Image:Archaeopteryx bavarica Detail.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Munich Specimen'']]
# '''Solnhofen Specimen''' (BSP 1999): Discovered in the 1960s near [[Eichstätt]], Germany and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the [[Bürgermeister-Müller-Museum]] in Solnhofen. It was originally classified as a ''[[Compsognathus]]'' by an amateur collector. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, ''[[Wellnhoferia]] grandis''. 
# '''Munich Specimen''' (S6, formerly known as the ''Solnhofen-Aktien-Verein Specimen''):  Discovered in 1991 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the [[Paläontologische Museum München]] in [[Munich]]. What was initially believed to be a bony [[sternum]] turned out to be part of the [[coracoid]] (Wellnhofer & Tischlinger, 2004), but a [[cartilaginous]] sternum may have been present. May be a new species, ''A. bavarica''.
# '''Bürgermeister-Müller Specimen''': An eighth, fragmentary specimen, was discovered in 1997. It is kept at the Bürgermeister-Müller Museum.
# A further fragmentary fossil was found in 2004. 
# '''Thermopolis Specimen''' Discovered in Germany. Long in a private collection, described in 2005 by Mayr, Pohl, and Peters. Donated to the [[Wyoming Dinosaur Center]] in [[Thermopolis, Wyoming]], it has the best-preserved head and feet. The "Thermopolis" specimen, was described in the December 2, 2005 ''Science'' journal article as "A well-preserved Archaeopteryx specimen with theropod features", shows that the ''Archaeopteryx'' lacked a reversed toe&mdash;a universal feature of birds&mdash;limiting its ability to perch in trees and implying a terrestrial lifestyle. This has been interpreted as evidence of [[Theropoda|theropod]] ancestry. The specimen also has a hyperextendible second toe. "Until now, the feature was thought to belong only to the species' close relatives, the [[Deinonychosauria|deinonychosaurs]]."

===Synonyms===
The synonymy of ''A. lithographica'' is extremely confused. Dozens of names have been published for the handful of specimens, most of which are simply spelling errors (''lapsus''). Originally, the name ''A. lithographica'' only referred to the single feather described by von Meyer. Swinton (1960) proposed that the name ''Archaeopteryx lithographica'' be officially transferred from the feather to the London specimen. The ICZN did suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens (ICZN, 1961), which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between von Meyer and his opponent [[Johann Andreas Wagner]] (whose ''Griphosaurus'' - "enigmatic lizard" - was a vitriolic sneer at von Meyer's ''Archaeopteryx''). In addition, descriptions of ''Archaeopteryx'' fossils as [[pterosaur]]s before their true nature was realized were also suppressed (ICZN, 1977).

If two names are given, the first denotes the original describer of the "species", the second the author on whom the given name combination is based. As always in [[zoological nomenclature]], putting an author's name in parentheses denotes that the [[taxon]] was originally described in a different genus.

Track 11 on the Lemon Demon CD Dinosaurchestra is entitled Archaeopteryx. The song is about a person with an intense dislike of birdkind based on a jealousy of their flight ability who travels back in time and kills the original Archaeopteryx, thus killing off all future birds.
