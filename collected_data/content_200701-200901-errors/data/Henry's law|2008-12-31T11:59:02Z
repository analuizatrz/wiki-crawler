In [[chemistry]], '''Henry's law''' is one of the [[gas laws]], formulated by [[William Henry (chemist)|William Henry]] in 1803. It states that:
:''At a constant temperature, the amount of a given gas dissolved in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the [[partial pressure]] of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid.''
An equivalent way of stating the law is that the [[solubility]] of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the pressure ''of that gas'' above the liquid. Henry's law has since been shown to apply for a wide range of dilute solutions, not merely those of gases.

An everyday example of Henry's law is given by [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]]s such as [[cola]]s (and also by [[beer]]s and [[sparkling wine]]s). Before the bottle or can is opened, the gas above the drink is almost pure [[carbon dioxide]] at a pressure slightly higher than [[atmospheric pressure]]. The drink itself contains dissolved carbon dioxide. When the bottle or can is opened, some of this gas escapes, giving the characteristic hiss (or "pop" in the case of a [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] bottle). Because the pressure of carbon dioxide above the liquid is now lower, some of the dissolved carbon dioxide comes out of solution as bubbles. If a glass of the drink is left in the open, the concentration of carbon dioxide in solution will come into equilibrium with the carbon dioxide in the air, and the drink will go "flat": luckily for drinks manufacturers, this is a relatively slow process for solutions of carbon dioxide in water.

==Formula and the Henry's law constant==
Henry's law can be put into mathematical terms (at constant temperature) as
:<math>p = k_{\rm H}\, c</math>
where ''p'' is the [[partial pressure]] of the [[solute]], ''c'' is the [[concentration]] of the solute  and ''k''<sub>H</sub> is a constant with the [[Dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of pressure divided by concentration.<ref name="GreenBook">{{GreenBookRef2nd|page=50}}</ref> The constant, known as the Henry's law constant, depends on the solute, the solvent and the temperature.

Some values for ''k''<sub>H</sub> for gases dissolved in [[water (molecule)|water]] at 298&nbsp;[[kelvin]]s include: 
:[[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) : 769.2 [[Litre|L]]·[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]/[[Mole (unit)|mol]]
:[[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) : 29.4 L·atm/mol
:[[hydrogen]] (H<sub>2</sub>) : 1282.1 L·atm/mol

There are other forms of Henry's Law, each of which defines the constant ''k''<sub>H</sub> differently and requires different dimensional units.<ref name=SmithandHarvey>{{cite journal|author=Francis L. Smith and Allan H. Harvey |year=2007 |month=September |title=Avoid Common Pitfalls When Using Henry's Law |journal=CEP (Chemical Engineering Progress) |volume= |issue= |pages= |issn=0360-7275}}</ref> In particular, the "concentration" of the solute in solution may also be expressed as a [[mole fraction]] or as a [[molality]].<ref name="GreenBook" />

where:
:''c'' = [[amount concentration]] of gas in solution (in mol/L)
:''p'' = [[partial pressure]] of gas above the solution (in [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]])
:''x'' = [[mole fraction]] of gas in solution 

As can be seen by comparing the equations in the above table, the Henry's law constant ''k''<sub>H,pc</sub> is simply the inverse of the constant ''k''<sub>H,cp</sub>. Since all ''k''<sub>H</sub> may be referred to as Henry's law constants, readers of the technical literature must be quite careful to note which version of the Henry's Law equation is being used.<ref name=SmithandHarvey/>

It should also be noted the Henry's Law is a limiting law that only applies for ''sufficiently dilute'' solutions. The range of concentrations in which it applies becomes narrower the more the system diverges from non-ideal behavior. Roughly speaking, that is the more chemically ''different'' the solute is from the solvent. 

It also only applies simply for solutions where the solvent does not [[chemical reaction|react chemically]] with the gas being dissolved. A common example of a gas that does react with the solvent is [[carbon dioxide]], which forms [[carbonic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) to a certain degree with water.

===Temperature dependence of the Henry constant===
When the temperature of a system changes, the Henry constant will also change.<ref name=SmithandHarvey/> This is why some people prefer to name it Henry coefficient. There are multiple equations assessing the effect of temperature on the constant. This form of the [[van 't Hoff equation]] is one example:<ref name="multiple"/>

:<math> k_{\rm H}(T) = k_{\rm H}(T^\ominus)\, \exp{ \left[ -C \, \left( \frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T^\ominus}\right)\right]}\, </math>

where
:''k''<sub>H</sub> for a given temperature is the Henry's Law constant (as defined in the first section of this article), identical with ''k''<sub>H,pc</sub> defined in Table 1,
:''T'' is the [[thermodynamic temperature]],
:''T''<sup> <s>o</s></sup> refers to the standard temperature (298 K).

This equation is only an approximation, and should be used only when no better, experimentally-derived formula is known for a given gas.

The following table lists some values for constant ''C'' (in kelvins) in the equation above:

Because solubility of gases is decreasing with increasing temperature, the partial pressure a given gas concentration has in liquid must increase. While heating water (saturated with nitrogen) from 25 °C to 95 °C the solubility will decrease to about 43% of its initial value. This can be verified when heating water in a pot: small bubbles evolve and rise, long before the water reaches boiling temperature. Similarly, carbon dioxide from a [[Carbonation|carbonated]] drink escapes much faster when the drink is not cooled because of the increased partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in higher temperatures. Partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater doubles with every 16 K increase in temperature.<ref>Takahashi, T; Sutherland, SC; Sweeney, C; Poisson, A; Metzl, N; Tilbrook, B; Bates, N; Wanninkhof, R; Feely, RA; Sabine, C; Olafsson, J; Nojiri, Y  "''Global sea-air CO<sub>2</sub> flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO<sub>2</sub> and seasonal biological and temperature effects''"  Deep-Sea Research (Part II, Topical Studies in Oceanography) [Deep-Sea Research (II Top. Stud. Oceanogr.)] '''49''', 9-10, pp. 1601-1622, 2002</ref>

The constant ''C'' may be regarded as:

:<math> C = \frac{\Delta_{\rm solv}H}{R} = -\frac{{\rm d}\left[ \ln k_{\rm H}(T)\right]}{{\rm d}(1/T)}</math>

where
:Δ<sub>solv</sub>''H'' is the  [[enthalpy of solution]]
:''R'' is the  [[gas constant]].

==Henry's law in geophysics==

In [[geophysics]], a version of Henry's law applies to the solubility of a [[noble gas]] in contact with [[silicate]] melt.  One equation used is
:<math>C_{\rm melt}/C_{\rm gas} = \exp\left[-\beta(\mu^{\rm E}_{\rm melt} - \mu^{\rm E}_{\rm gas})\right]\,</math>

where:
:''C'' = the [[number concentration]]s of the solute gas in the melt and gas phases
:''β'' = 1/''k''<sub>B</sub>''T'', an inverse temperature scale: ''k''<sub>B</sub> = the [[Boltzmann constant]]
:''µ''<sup>E</sup> = the excess [[chemical potential]]s of the solute gas in the two phases.

==Henry's law versus Raoult's law==
For a dilute solution, the concentration of the solute is approximately proportional to its [[mole fraction]] ''x'', and Henry's law can be written as:
:<math>p = k_{\rm H}\,x</math>
This can be compared with [[Raoult's law]]:
:<math>p = p^\star\,x</math>
where ''p''* is the vapor pressure of the pure component.

At first sight, Raoult's law appears to be a special case of Henry's law where ''k''<sub>H</sub>&nbsp;= ''p''*. This is true for pairs of closely related substances, such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]], which obey Raoult's law over the entire composition range: such mixtures are called "ideal mixtures".

The general case is that both laws are [[Limit of a function|limit laws]], and they apply at opposite ends of the composition range. The vapor pressure of the component in large excess, such as the solvent for a dilute solution, is proportional to the mole fraction, and the constant of proportionality is the vapor pressure of the pure substance (Raoult's law). The vapor pressure of the solute is also proportional to the mole fraction, but the constant of proportionality is different and must be determined experimentally (Henry's law). In mathematical terms:
:Raoult's law: <math>\lim_{x\to 1}\left( \frac{p}{x}\right) = p^\star</math>
:Henry's law: <math>\lim_{x\to 0}\left( \frac{p}{x}\right) = k_{\rm H}</math>

==Standard chemical potential==
Henry's law has been shown to apply to a wide range of solutes in the limit of "infinite dilution" (''x''&rarr;0), including non-volatile substances such as [[sucrose]] or even [[sodium chloride]]. In these cases, it is necessary to state the law in terms of [[chemical potential]]s. For a solute in an ideal dilute solution, the chemical potential depends on the concentration:
:<math>\mu = \mu^\ominus + RT\ln{(\gamma_c c)}\,</math>, where <math>\gamma_c = \frac{k_{\rm H}}{p^\star}</math> for a volatile solutes.
For non-ideal solutions, the [[activity coefficient]] ''&gamma;<sub>c</sub>'' depends on the concentration and must be determined at the concentration of interest. The activity coefficient can also be obtained for non-volatile solutes, where the vapor pressure of the pure substance is negligeable, by using the [[Gibbs–Duhem relation]]:
:<math>\sum_i n_i\, {\rm d}\mu_i = 0</math>
By measuring the change in vapor pressure (and hence chemical potential) of the solvent, the chemical potential of the solute can be deduced.
