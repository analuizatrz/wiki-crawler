The '''International Criminal Court''' ('''ICC''' or '''ICCt''')<ref>International Criminal Court is sometimes abbreviated as ICCt to distinguish it from [[ICC|several other organizations abbreviated as ICC]].  However, the more common abbreviation ICC is used in this article.</ref> was established in 2002 as a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and the [[crime of aggression]], although it cannot currently exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression.<ref name=article5/>  The court came into being on [[July 1]] [[2002]] — the date its founding [[treaty]], the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], entered into force<ref name=ai2002/> — and it can only prosecute crimes committed on or after that date.<ref name=article11/>

The Court can generally exercise [[jurisdiction]] only in cases where the accused is a national of a state party, the alleged crime took place on the [[territory]] of a state party, or a situation is referred to the Court by the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref name=articles12&13/>  The Court is designed to complement existing national judicial systems: it can exercise its jurisdiction only when national courts are unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute such crimes.<ref name=article17/><ref name=article20/>  Primary responsibility to investigate and punish crimes is therefore left to individual states.<ref name=prosecutor/>

To date, the Court has opened investigations into four situations: Northern [[Uganda]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]] and [[Darfur]].<ref name=cases/>  The Court has issued nine public arrest warrants<!-- <ref name=economist>{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9441341|title= How the mighty are falling|accessdate= 2007-07-17|date= [[5 July]] [[2007]]|publisher= ''[[The Economist]]''}}</ref> --> and two suspects are in custody, awaiting trial.

==History==
In 1948, following the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo Tribunals]], the [[United Nations General Assembly]] recognised the need for a permanent international court to deal with atrocities of the kind committed during [[World War II]].<ref name=iccfact/>  At the request of the General Assembly, the [[International Law Commission]] drafted two draft statutes by the early 1950s but these were shelved as the [[Cold War]] made the establishment of an international criminal court politically unrealistic.<ref name="Cato">Gary T.

On [[July 17]] [[1998]], the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted by a vote of 120 to 7, with 21 countries abstaining.

==Jurisdiction==
===Crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court===
Article 5 of the Rome Statute grants the Court jurisdiction over four groups of crimes, which it refers to as the “''most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole''”: the crime of [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and the [[crime of aggression]].  The statute defines each of these crimes except for aggression: it provides that the Court will not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the states parties agree on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it may be prosecuted.<ref name=article5>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 5] of the Rome Statute. Accessed [[23 November]] [[2006]].</ref>

Many states wanted to add [[terrorism]] and [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] to the list of crimes covered by the Rome Statute; however, the states were unable to agree on a definition for terrorism and it was decided not to include drug trafficking as this might overwhelm the Court's limited resources.<ref name=iccfact>United Nations Department of Public Information, December 2002. [http://www.un.org/News/facts/iccfact.htm ''The International Criminal Court''].  Accessed [[5 December]] [[2006]].</ref>  India lobbied to have the use of [[nuclear weapons]] and other [[weapons of mass destruction]] included as war crimes but this move was also defeated.<ref name="India">Dilip Lahiri, [[17 July]] [[1998]].

Embassy of India, Washington, D.C.  Accessed [[31 December]] [[2006]].</ref>  India has expressed concern that “the Statute of the ICC lays down, by clear implication, that the use of weapons of mass destruction is not a war crime. This is an extraordinary message to send to the international community.”<ref name="India"/>

Some commentators have argued that the Rome Statute defines crimes too broadly or too vaguely.  For example, China has argued that the definition of ‘war crimes’ goes beyond that accepted under [[customary international law]].<ref>Lu Jianping and Wang Zhixiang. “China's Attitude Towards the ICC” in ''Journal of International Criminal Justice'', July 2005.</ref>

Article 123 of the Rome Statute provides that a [[International Criminal Court Review Conference|Review Conference]] shall be convened in 2009, and that this conference may review the list of crimes contained in Article 5.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/13.htm Article 123] of the Rome Statute.

===Territorial jurisdiction===
During the negotiations that led to the Rome Statute, a large number of states argued that the Court should be allowed to exercise [[universal jurisdiction]].  However, this proposal was defeated due in large part to opposition from the United States.<ref>Elizabeth Wilmhurst, 1999. ‘Jurisdiction of the Court’, p. 136.  In Roy S Lee (ed.), ''The International Criminal Court: The Making of the Rome Statute''.  The Hague: Kluwer Law International. ISBN 90-411-1212-X.</ref>  A compromise was reached, allowing the Court to exercise jurisdiction only under certain limited circumstances, namely:
*where the person accused of committing a crime is a national of a state party (or where the person's state has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court); 
*where the alleged crime was committed on the territory of a state party (or where the state on whose territory the crime was committed has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court); or
*where a situation is referred to the Court by the UN Security Council.<ref name=articles12&13>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Articles 12 & 13] of the Rome Statute. Accessed [[23 November]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Temporal jurisdiction===
The Court's jurisdiction does not apply retroactively: it can only prosecute crimes committed on or after [[1 July]] [[2002]] (the date on which the Rome Statute entered into force).  Where a state becomes party to the Rome Statute after that date, the Court can exercise jurisdiction automatically with respect to crimes committed after the statute enters into force for that state.<ref name=article11>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 11] of the Rome Statute. Accessed [[23 November]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Complementarity===
The Court is intended as a court of last resort, investigating and prosecuting only where national courts have failed.  Article 17 of the Statute provides that a case is inadmissible if:

:‘(a)     The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;

:(b)     The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of the State genuinely to prosecute;

:(c)     The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;

:(d)     The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court.’<ref name=article17>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 17] of the Rome Statute. Accessed [[4 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

Article 20, paragraph 3, specifies that, if a person has already been tried by another court, the ICC cannot try them again for the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:

:‘(a)     Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court; or

:(b)     Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.’<ref name=article20>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 20] of the Rome Statute.

===Judicial Divisions===
{{main|Judges of the International Criminal Court}}

Judges are assigned to divisions according to their qualifications and experience.<ref name=structure/>

Judges are elected to the Court by the Assembly of States Parties.<ref name=chambers/>  They serve nine-year terms and are not generally eligible for re-election.<ref name=chambers/>  All judges must be nationals of states parties to the Rome Statute, and no two judges may be nationals of the same state.<ref name=article36>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/4.htm Article 36] of the Rome Statute.

The Prosecutor may open an investigation under three circumstances:<ref name=prosecutor/>
*when a situation is referred to him by a state party;
*when a situation is referred to him by the [[United Nations Security Council]], acting to address a threat to international peace and security; or
*when the Pre-Trial Chamber authorises him to open an investigation on the basis of information received from other sources, such as individuals or non-governmental organisations.

Critics of the Court argue that there are “insufficient checks and balances on the authority of the ICC prosecutor and judges” and “insufficient protection against politicized prosecutions or other abuses”.<ref name="US DoS faq">US Department of State, [[30 July]] [[2003]].

==Rights of the accused==

Some argue that the protections offered by the ICC are insufficient.  According to the [[Heritage Foundation]], “Americans who appear before the court would be denied such basic constitutional rights as trial by a jury of one's peers, protection from double jeopardy, and the right to confront one's accusers.”<ref name="Heritage">Brett D.

[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[United Nations Security Council]] may refer situations to the ICC]]
Unlike the [[International Court of Justice]], the ICC is legally and functionally independent from the United Nations.

The [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] may refer to the Court situations that would not otherwise fall under the Court's jurisdiction (as it did in relation to the situation in [[Darfur]], which the Court could not otherwise have prosecuted as [[Sudan]] is not a state party).  Article 16 of the Rome Statute also allows the Security Council to require the Court to defer from investigating a case for a period of 12 months.<ref name="Article 16">[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 16] of the Rome Statute.

It is unclear to what extent the Court is compatible with reconciliation processes that grant [[amnesty]] to human rights abusers as part of agreements to end conflict.<ref name=dworkin>Anthony Dworkin, December 2003.  "[http://www.crimesofwar.org/icc_magazine/icc-intro.html Introduction]" in ''The International Criminal Court: An End to Impunity?''  Crimes of War Project.  Accessed [[18 September]] [[2007]].</ref>  Article 16 of the Rome Statute allows the Security Council to prevent the Court from investigating or prosecuting a case,<ref name="Article 16"/> and Article 53 allows the Prosecutor the discretion not to initiate an investigation if he or she believes that “an investigation would not serve the interests of justice”.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/5.htm Article 53] of the Rome Statute. Accessed [[31 December]] [[2006]].</ref>  The President of the ICC, Philippe Kirsch, has said that "some limited amnesties may be compatible" with a country's obligations genuinely to investigate or prosecute under the statute.<ref name=dworkin/>

It is sometimes argued that amnesties are necessary to allow the peaceful transfer of power from abusive regimes.  By denying states the right to offer amnesty to human rights abusers, the International Criminal Court may make it more difficult to negotiate an end to conflict and a transition to democracy.  For example, the outstanding arrest warrants for four leaders of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] are regarded as an obstacle to ending the insurgency in Uganda.<ref>Tim Cocks, [[30 May]] [[2007]].  “[http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN056745.html Uganda urges traditional justice for rebel crimes]”.
