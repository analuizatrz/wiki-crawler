'''Mesocarb''' (Sidnocarb, Sydnocarb) is a [[stimulant]] drug which was developed in the [[USSR]] in the 1970s. <ref> Anokhina IP, Zabrodin GD, Svirinovskii IaE. Characteristics of the central action of sidnocarb. Zhurnal Nevropatologii i Psikhiatrii Imeni S S Korsakova. 1974;74(4):594-602.

(Russian) </ref> It is also listed as having [[antidepressant]] and [[anticonvulsant]] properties. 

Mesocarb is sold in Russia as 5 milligram tablets under the brand name Sydnocarb. Hydroxylated metabolites can be detected in urine for up to 10 days after consumption, reflecting a relatively long half-life.<ref> Shpak AV, Appolonova SA, Semenov VA.

Mesocarb is almost unknown in the western world and is neither used in medicine or studied scientifically to any great extent outside Russia and other countries in the former Soviet Union. It has however been added to the list of drugs under international control and is illegal in most countries, despite its multiple therapeutic applications and the lack of significant abuse potential seen in clinical practice.<ref> Rudenko GM and Altshuler RA (1978) Experimental and clinical study of Sydnocarb.
