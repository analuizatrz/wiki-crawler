'''Paramore''' is a [[pop punk]] band from [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. The band consists of [[lead vocalist]] Hayley Williams, [[lead guitarist]] Josh Farro, [[bassist]] Jeremy Davis and [[drummer]] Zac Farro. Paramore released their debut ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'' in 2005, an EP entitled ''[[The Summer Tic EP|The Summer Tic]]'' in 2006, and their third release ''[[Riot!]]'' in 2007.

==History==
===Formation and ''All We Know Is Falling'' (2002-2005)===
The Franklin, Tennessee-based band Paramore was formed by members: brothers Zac and Josh Farro, Jeremy Davis and Hayley Williams, with the addition of Jason Bynum later on. At the age of 13, Williams moved from her hometown of [[Meridian, Mississippi]] to the Nashville suburb, where she met the brothers. <ref name="AMG">{{cite web| title= Biography| publisher= All Music| url= http://wc06.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0pfrxq8sldae~T1 | accessdate= 2007-08-16}}</ref> The name Paramore had come from a friend of the band's mother's maiden name, and after finding the meaning of the word ("secret lover") the band took up the name, despite having the incorrect spelling.<ref name="Euro">{{cite web| title= Interview with Paramore| publisher= Euro Punk| url= http://www.europunk.net/interviews.php?id=173 | accessdate= 2007-08-17}}</ref>

Over the following years, Paramore performed at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals [[Purple Door]] and [[Warped Tour]]. John Janick at the label [[Fueled by Ramen]] got ahold of Paramore's demos and went to a [[Taste of Chaos]] performance in [[Orlando, Florida]] to see the band perform live. After a small performance at a warehouse, the band was signed to the label in April 2005.<ref name="Trades">{{cite web| title= Hayley Williams and Josh Farro of Paramore| publisher= The Trades| url= http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440 | accessdate= 2007-08-16}}</ref> Shortly before they began to record their debut album ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'', Davis, the bassist left the band. ''All We Know Is Falling'' was released on [[July 24]], [[2005]] and reached #30 on the Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. The album was, for the most part, about Davis' departure from the band. Hembree was later added to the line-up to replace Davis. Paramore was featured on the Shira Girl Stage of the 2005 Warped Tour<ref name="Trades"/> and later that December Hunter Lamb replaced Bynum on guitar.<ref name="AMG"/>

===''Riot!'' (2006-Present)===
In January of 2006 they were a part of the Winter Go West Tour where they played alongside Seattle bands [[Amber Pacific]] and [[The Lashes]]. In the spring of 2006 they were an opening act on the headlining tours for [[Bayside]] and then [[The Rocket Summer]]. After being asked by the band, Davis returned to Paramore. They also toured the United Kingdom from [[October 5]] to [[October 15]], [[2006]], where they ended in London at The [[Mean Fiddler]]. Paramore toured in [[Japan]] for the Punk Spring Fest and also played some dates in [[Australia]].<ref name="Tour">{{cite web| title= Paramore (Japan, Australia, U.S.)| publisher= Punknews.org| url= http://www.punknews.org/article/22573 | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> During the summer of 2006, Paramore played a portion of Warped Tour, primarily on the Volcom and Hurley Stages.
