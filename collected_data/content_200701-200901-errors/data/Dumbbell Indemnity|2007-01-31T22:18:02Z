==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}

Upon noticing [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'s depressed state, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] takes him out for the night to meet women. He has no luck, but meets the perfect woman on his walk home. He is not exactly smooth with Renee, but she takes a shine to him. He begins to treat her like royalty, but as a result, maxes out his Player's Club card and has to find a way to make money. 

He devises a plan where Homer will steal Moe's car and destroy it on the train tracks. Homer steals the car but stops to see a drive-in movie and misses the train, so Homer switches to another plan and sinks the car to the bottom of the lake. The cops are watching him the entire time, and he goes to jail. 

Homer makes a jail break and Moe eventually tells Renee about his debt, and pitches a plan to her where he will fake his death. She leaves him, and he accidentally sets the bar alight. Homer arrives to kill him, but after a brief struggle, both pass out. 

[[Barney Gumble|Barney]], who was in the bathroom, saves them both as well as two kegs and two cases of beer. Their friendship is restored. To help him, Homer lets Moe turn his house into the new hangout.
