The '''Boy Scouts of America''' ('''BSA''') is the largest [[youth organization]] in the United States having over five million members<ref name="grolier">{{cite web | url =http://nbk.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=a2003470-h | title =Boy Scouts | format = | work =The New Book of Knowledge® | publisher =Grolier Online | accessdate =2008-02-24}}</ref>. It was founded in 1910 as part of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]]. It is believed that over one hundred million Americans have been members.  Individual units of the BSA rely largely on volunteers although at higher commercial levels of administration professionals are employed. The BSA is a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]].

The BSA arose amidst concerns of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] from people who sought to promote the [[social welfare]] of young men. The BSA adheres to the [[Scout method]] to teach typical Scouting values such as [[self-esteem]], [[citizenship]] and [[outdoors]]manship through a variety of activities such as [[camping]], [[aquatics]] and [[hiking]].<ref name="vision">{{cite web | url =http://www.scouting.org/Legal/mission.aspx | title =Mission Statement and Vision Statement | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref><ref name="mbcom">{{cite web | url =http://www.meritbadge.com/info/aims.htm | title =Boy Scout Aims and Methods | format = | work = | publisher = Meritbadge.com | accessdate =2006-10-27}}</ref>  

The BSA recognizes the achievements of Scouts through advancements in rank and special awards. It includes several membership divisions, targeted at boys ages seven through seventeen and young men and women ages fourteen through twenty-one. The BSA operates locally, through volunteer-led units generally known as troops, packs and crews.

The BSA has been both criticized and supported for its membership policies, which prohibit participation by atheists, agnostics, and "known or avowed" homosexuals, and limit participation by girls. (However, there is a parallel association, the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]], which readily admits young women into its ranks.  These two organizations are closely associated, and have been known to work in tandem for major camporees and similar events.)

==Origins==
{{main|History of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]] in the United States was at its height during the early twentieth century. With the migration of families from rural to urban centers, there were concerns among some people that young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism.  The [[YMCA]] was an early promoter of [[social welfare]] and other reforms involving young men.  [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] started [[Scouting]] in 1907 in [[Great Britain]] and the [[Social movement|movement]] began to grow overseas.<ref name="NT">{{cite journal | first = Jonny | last = Beardsall | title = Dib, dib, dib... One hundred years of scouts at Brownsea | journal = The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] Magazine  | year = 2007 | issue = Spring 2007 | pages = pages 52-55}}</ref>

In 1909, Chicago publisher [[William D. Boyce|W. D. Boyce]] was visiting [[London]], [[England]] where he learned of the Scouting movement.<ref>{{cite web | last = Peterson | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2001 | url =http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0110/d-wwas.html | title =The Man Who Got Lost in the Fog | format = | work =Scouting Magazine| publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-07-11}}</ref> Soon after his return to the US, Boyce incorporated the Boy Scouts of America on [[February 8]], [[1910]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Rowan | first =Edward L | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2005 | title =To Do My Best: James E. West and the History of the Boy Scouts of America | publisher =Las Vegas International Scouting Museum | location = | id =ISBN 0-9746479-1-8 }}</ref>  The YMCA became interested in the nascent BSA movement and provided support.  The first managing secretary was John M. Alexander, succeeded by [[Edgar M. Robinson]], both from the YMCA.  [[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]] took over as managing secretary and later as [[Chief Scout Executive]], beginning a long relationship with the BSA.

==Ideals==
[[Image:BSA 2006-2010 Strategic Plan.png|thumb|150px|BSA "Strategic Plan Identity" emblem]]
The stated objectives of the BSA are referred to as "Aims of Scouting": character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Each of the membership divisions of the BSA pursues these aims through methods that are designed to be appropriate for the age and maturity of the participants.<ref name="ldrtrng">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/BoyScouts/NewLeaderTraining/basic.aspx | title =Basic Leader Training | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref>  One of these methods is the establishment of ideals.  These are statements of goals against which each youth can measure and improve himself.  For Boy Scouts and Varsity Scouts, these ideals are reflected in the [[Scout Oath]], [[Scout Law|Law]], Motto and Slogan.  There are similar sets of ideals for Cub Scouts and Venturers.

;The Scout Motto<ref name="11thhandbook">{{cite book | last = | first = | year =1998 
|edition = 11th| title =The Boy Scout Handbook | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | location = Irving, TX| isbn = 0-8395-3105-2|pages=7,9}}</ref>
:''Be Prepared.''
;The Scout Slogan<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:''Do a Good Turn Daily.''
;The Scout Oath<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:''On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.''
;The Scout Law<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:''A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.''
;The Outdoor Code<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:''As an American, I will do my best to be clean in my outdoor manners, be careful with fire, be considerate in the outdoors, and be conservation-minded.''
;The Scout Sign<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:The upper arm is held horizontally out to the right side, and the forearm is held vertically, making a right angle. This is to symbolize the fact that Scouts always do the right thing.  The palm of the hand faces forward, with the first three fingers extended and the tip of the thumb placed over the tip of the little finger. This symbolizes how the strong protects the weak. The sign is often used to quiet scouts, when attention is required by a leader.
;The Scout Salute<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:A [[three-finger salute (Scouts)|three-finger salute]] using the same configuration as the Scout Sign, with the tip of the [[index finger]] touching the forehead or hat brim.
;The Scout Handshake<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:This is the traditional [[handshake]] done with the left hand, because upon meeting the Zulu king, [[Dinuzulu]], the king removed his shield which was worn on the left arm and extended to Lord Baden-Powell a hand shake with his left hand. The left hand shake was a Zulu sign of vulnerability and respect. In the boy scout handbook (11th edition) it includes that a boy scout handshake is done with the left hand because that is the hand that is closest to your heart.
The BSA Scout Oath and Law have remained unchanged since they were first developed in 1910.<ref name="v6n4">{{cite journal|last=Scott| first=David C.| year=2006| title=The Origins of BSA's 1910 Handbook| journal=International Scouting Collectors Association Journal (ISCA Journal) | volume=6| issue=4| pages=6-13}}</ref><ref name="11thhandbook"/>

==Membership divisions==
In the BSA, Scouting is considered to be one movement with three main membership divisions:
*'''[[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]]''', the largest of the three divisions, is available to boys from first-grade through fifth-grade or seven through ten years old and their families. It uses a challenging system to pursue the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.<ref name="vision"/> Cub Scouting is divided into age-based levels of Tiger Cubs, Cub Scouts, and Webelos Scouts.
*'''[[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]]''' is the flagship division of the BSA for boys ten to eighteen.  It uses a system of outdoor activities to achieve the aims of Scouting.  '''[[Varsity Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Varsity Scouting]]''' is modified Boy Scouting available to boys from fourteen through seventeen that adds a system of [[high adventure]] and sporting activities to appeal to the older boy, with an emphasis on team competition.  The '''[[Order of the Arrow]]''' (OA) is the Boy Scout national honor society for experienced campers, based on [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]<!--- American Indian is the preferred usage by the BSA.  Read the linked article for a thorough discussion.---> traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service and brotherhood.
*'''[[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]''' is the division for young men and women ages fourteen through twenty-one.<ref name="venturerage">Venturer Application 28-303K: "Venturers registered in a crew or ship prior to their twenty-first birthday may continue as members after their 21st birthday until the crew or ship recharters or they reach their twenty-second birthday, whichever comes first."</ref> Its purpose is to provide positive experiences to help youth mature and to prepare them to become responsible adults.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-388.aspx | title =What is Venturing |work =Fact Sheet | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref>  '''[[Sea Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]]''' is the nautical oriented part of this division.

==Organization==
===National Council=== 
The National Council is the corporate membership of the Boy Scouts of America that is [[Congressional charter|chartered]] by the United States Congress to operate the BSA program. The National Council members include the elected National Executive Board, the regional executive committees, the local council representatives, members at large, and honorary members.  The National program is directed by the National Executive Board and administered by the [[Chief Scout Executive]] using a staff of professional Scouters.  National is registered as a [[non-profit]] private corporation and is funded from private donations, membership dues, corporate sponsors, and special events.

The BSA is governed by the National Executive Board and directed by the [[national president of the Boy Scouts of America|national president]], elected by representatives from the local councils.<ref name="bsaorg">{{cite web | last = Nelson | first = Bill| authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://usscouts.org/aboutbsa/bsaorg.asp| title = BSA National Office: Organization of the Boy Scouts of America | format =  | work = | publisher = U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref>  Board memberships include regular elected members, presidents, the Advisory Council chair and the chairman of the Board of Regents of the National Eagle Scout Association.  The board may also include up to five appointed youth members.  Professional Scouters of the National staff are nonvoting members.

The National Executive Board has five group standing committees: the Administration Group Committee, Program Group Committee, Human Resources Group Committee, Regional Presidents' Group Committee, and Relationships/Marketing Group Committee.  Each of these committees is in turn directly responsible for a corresponding support group that provides administrative functions.  Group committees may in turn be responsible for support standing committees and groups divided into divisions.

====Regions and areas====
{{Infobox Awards |box_width= |halign=center |award1=[[Image:BSA Region Map.svg|200px]] |award2=Boy Scouts of America Regions as of 1992}}
For administrative purposes, the BSA is divided into four regions–Western, Central, Southern and Northeast.<ref name="bsaorg"/><ref>{{dmoz|Recreation/Scouting/Organizations/Boy_Scouts_of_America/Councils/|Boy Scouts of America: Councils}}</ref>  Each region is subdivided into areas, about six per region.

Each region has a volunteer president, assisted by volunteer officers and board members, and the day-to-day work of Scouting is managed by the regional director, assistant and associate regional directors, and area directors.  Regions and areas are subdivisions of the National Council and do not have a corporate status separate from the BSA.

*The '''Central Region''' covers all of Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin, and parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia.

*The '''Northeast Region''' covers all of Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Puerto Rico, Transatlantic Council, and the Virgin Islands, and parts of Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerbsa.org/ |title=Northeast Region, Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

*The '''Southern Region''' covers all of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://srbsa.org/ |title=Southern Region, Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

*The '''Western Region''' covers all of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Far East Council and the Pacific Basin, and parts of Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrbsa.org/ |title=Western Region, Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

===Local councils===
{{maincat|Local councils of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The BSA program is administered through 308 local councils, with each council covering a geopolitical area that may vary from a single city to and entire state.  Councils receive an annual charter from the National Council and are usually incorporated as a charitable organization.<ref name="bsaorg"/>

The council level organization is similar to that of the National Council.  The council executive board is headed by the council president and is made up of representatives from each chartered organization and annually elected members-at-large.  The board establishes the council program and carries out the resolutions, policies, and activities of the council. Board members are registered volunteer Scouters and often work at the unit level. Youth members may be selected to the council executive board according to the council by-laws.  

The Scout executive manages council operations—including finance, property management, advancement and awards, registrations and Scout Shop sales—with a staff of other professionals and para-professionals.  [[Commissioner Service|Commissioners]] lead the unit service functions of the council, help maintain the standards of the BSA Scouts of America and assures a healthy unit program.
[[Image:Philly Scout.png|thumb|Bruce S. Marks Scout Resource Center]]

The BSA charters two councils for Scouts who live overseas, largely on military bases in Europe and Asia.  The [[American Scouting overseas#Transatlantic Council|Transatlantic Council]], headquartered in Germany, serves BSA units in much of Europe, and the [[American Scouting overseas#Far East Council|Far East Council]], headquartered in Japan, serves units in the western Pacific areas.  The [[American Scouting overseas#Direct Service|Direct Service]] branch makes the Scouting movement available to U.S. citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas.  The [[Scouting in Hawaii#Aloha Council|Aloha Council]] in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Marianas Islands]] and in the sovereign countries of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Palau]].

===Boroughs===
Because of the high density of units, the Greater New York Councils<!---sic---> is divided into five boroughs with each led by a borough Scout executive.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.bsa-gnyc.org/openrosters/view_homepage.asp?orgkey=1161 | title =Greater New York Councils | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate =2006-08-08}}</ref>  Each borough  is then divided into districts.

===Districts===
[[Image:Commissioner logo.png|thumb|75px|Commissioner]]
Councils are divided into districts with leadership provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the [[Commissioner Service|district commissioner]].<ref name="bsaorg"/>  Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers. The actual voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each organization (chartered organization) currently having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who elect the district chairman.

===Units and chartered organizations===
The unit is the main mgroup of the BSA.<ref name="bsaorg"/> A unit conducts Scouting for a chartered organization; it consists of registered youth members and registered adult volunteer members. Cub Scouts are organized as packs, Boy Scouts as troops, Varsity Scouts as teams, Venturers as crews, and Sea Scouts as ships.

Each unit is operated by a community-based organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group, or religious institution that has applied for and received a charter from the BSA. The chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place, and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the manager of Scouting in a chartered organization who serves as a liaison between the unit, the chartered organization, and the BSA.

Each unit is intended to be youth led.  Boy Scout meetings are run by a Boy Scout chosen by the troop, called the Senior Patrol Leader.  Venturing meetings are run by a Venturer chosen from the Crew, called the President.  Varsity Scout meetings are run by a Varsity Scout chosen from the Team, called the Captain, etc.  Each unit also has leaders chosen by the youths in the unit to lead activities such as campouts, service projects, etc.

The unit is led by a registered and trained leader– a Cubmaster, Scoutmaster, Coach, Advisor, or Skipper.  These leaders, with one or more assistants, are appointed by a unit committee and must be approved by both the chartered organization and the local council.

A unit's affairs is administered by a unit committee, which is appointed by the chartered organization. The unit committee is a group of adults, led by the committee chairman, who oversee the unit program and activities, and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment, and registration.

===Scouting for the handicapped===
There are about 100,000 physically or mentally disabled Scouts throughout the United States. Anyone certified as disabled "may enroll in Scouting and remain in its program beyond the regulation age limits. This provision allows all members to advance in Scouting as far as they wish."<ref name="grolier">&nbsp;</ref>

== Federal charter ==
The BSA was originally incorporated in Washington, D.C. in 1910. The BSA later lobbied the [[U.S. Congress]] for a [[Congressional charter|charter]].<ref name ="Murray">{{cite book | last =Murray | first =William D. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =1937 | title =The History of the Boy Scouts of America | publisher = Boy Scouts of America }}</ref> The Boy Scouts of America was granted a federal charter in 1916, now codified as 36 U.S.C. Chapter 309,<ref>{{usctc|36|309|}} Federal charter, Boy Scouts of America</ref> stating that their purpose is to, <blockquote>"promote, through organization, and cooperation with other agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and others, to train them in scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods that were in common use by boy scouts on June 15, 1916."</blockquote> 

The charter authorized and set standards for the incorporation of the Boy Scouts of America. A provision in the federal charter gives the BSA the "exclusive right to use emblems, badges, descriptive or designating marks, and words or phrases" that they adopt. A federal charter is considered to be a prestigious national recognition of an organization.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=House votes on repealing federal charter of Boy Scouts | date=September 12, 2000 | publisher= | url =http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/12/boyscouts.congress.02.ap/index.html | work =CNN | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-09 }}</ref>

==Activities==
The National Council is divided into several administrative branches, called "groups." Each group is comprised of divisions that support the Scouting movement in various ways.  
===Publications===
The National Council Relationships/Publications Group publishes two magazines through the Marketing and Communications Division: ''[[Scouting (magazine)|Scouting]]'' is targeted towards adult leaders while ''[[Boys' Life]]'' is for the youth. ''Boys' Life'' is published in three editions.  The low edition is for Tiger Cubs and Cub Scouts through age eight; the middle edition is for Cub Scouts and Webelos Scouts above age nine; the high edition is for Boy Scouts and all other subscribers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-501.aspx |title=BSA at a Glance |accessdate=2007-02-15 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work=Fact Sheet |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>  If the subscription is obtained through registration in the BSA, the publisher will select the appropriate edition based on the boy's age.

===Scoutreach===
The Scoutreach Division emphasizes service to rural and urban areas and to minority populations; the name is a [[portmanteau]] combining ''Scout'' and ''outreach''.  The African American Focus works with African American populations in partnerships with the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], the [[NAACP]], African American Baptist churches and other groups.  The Hispanic/Latino Focus includes the ¡Scouting – Vale La Pena! emphasis for Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scoutreachbsa.org/ | title = Scoutreach Division&ndash; BSA | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url =  http://www.scoutingvalelapena.org/ | title = Scouting - Vale La Pena | format =  | work =

The Soccer and Scouting emphasis is a partnership with the [[NSCAA]] to provide alternatives for Cub Scout age Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.soccerandscouting.org/index.html | title = Soccer and Scouting | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2007-02-17}}</ref>  The Asian American Focus reaches out to Indo-Chinese American, Vietnamese American, Chinese American and Korean American communities.  The Rural Scouting focus targets small communities and includes the [[American Indian Scouting Association]], a partnership with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].

===Other divisions===
[[Image:ToothofTime.JPG|thumb|Tooth of Time]]
The High Adventure Division administers [[Philmont Scout Ranch]], [[Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases]] and [[Florida National High Adventure Sea Base]].  
The Jamboree Division provides support for the [[World Scout Jamboree|world]] and [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|national]] jamborees. The International Division is responsible for relations with other Scout and Guide organizations; it includes the Interamerican Scout Foundation and [[Direct Service]].<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.interamfoundation.org/ | title = Interamerican Scout Foundation | format =  | work =  | publisher =  | accessdate =2006-03-13}}</ref> The Relationships Division is responsible for relations with supporting organizations outside the BSA, including the [[AFL-CIO]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks]], [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] and all religious associations and awards.  Supply Division is responsible for uniforms and apparel, insignia, literature and equipment. It includes the  National Supply Group that sells equipment through Scout Shops, authorized resellers and the online ScoutStuff.org.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://ScoutStuff.org | title = ScoutStuff.org | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-03-13}}</ref> The Administrative Group comprises several divisions, such as the Finance Support Division, Human Resources Administration Division, Professional Development Division, Compensation and Benefits Division and Information Services Division that provide internal administrative service and support.

===Learning for Life===
[[Image:Learning for Life.svg|thumb|Learning for Life]]
[[Learning for Life]] (LFL) is an [[United States]] school and work-site based subsidiary of the BSA.  It utilizes programs designed for schools and community-based organizations that are designed to prepare youth for the complexities of contemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence, motivation, and self-esteem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/ |title=Learning for Life - Exploring |accessdate=2006-01-15 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

==Finance==
In 2005, the BSA ranked as the twelfth-largest [[non-profit]] organization in the US, with total revenues of $665.9 million.  As of January 2007, the American Institute of Philanthropy lists the Chief Scout Executive as having the fifth-highest compensation of any nonprofit chief in the United States, at $916,028.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html#top20 | title =Top 25 compensation packages | format = | work =American Institute of Philanthropy | publisher = | accessdate =2007-02-15}}</ref>   In 2005, the Chief Scout Executive's pay was 0.26% of total expenses, whereas the national average among charities stands at a higher 0.34%.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/catid/68/cpid/304.htm

==National Scouting Museum==
The National Scouting Museum was founded in 1959 in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. In 1986, it was moved to [[Murray State University]] in [[Murray, Kentucky]]  and moved to its present location in [[Irving, Texas]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsamuseum.org/ |title=National Scouting Museum |accessdate=2007-02-15 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>  The museum floor is 53,000&nbsp;ft² (5000&nbsp;m²) and is a modern facility, featuring several [[Norman Rockwell]] paintings, high adventure sections, hands-on learning experiences, interactive exhibits, and a historical collection tracing uniforms, themes, and documents from the beginning of the American Scouting movement.<ref name="natlmuseum">{{cite web | url = http://www.bsamuseum.org/ | title = National Scouting Museum |publisher = National Scouting Museum, Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-02-15}}</ref> Among the museum's artifacts are the Eagle Scout  medal of [[Arthur Rose Eldred]], the first [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].<ref name="eaglescoutorg">{{cite web | url = http://www.eaglescout.org/history/first_eagle.html | title = BSA's first Eagle Scout | publisher = Eagle Scout Resource Center | accessdate = 2006-07-07}}</ref>

==Good Turns==
In 1913, Scouts began the first of a series of Good Turns that included the promotion of a safe and sane [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]].  During the 50th anniversary of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Scouts provided service to the veterans.  Scouts rendered aid during the 1921 floods in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]].  President Roosevelt delivered a radio address in 1934 appealing for assistance for the distressed and needy: Scouts responded by collecting almost two million items of clothing, household furnishings, foodstuffs, and supplies.
[[Image:Smokey with scouts.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Smokey Bear]] with members of the Boy Scouts of America and the [[Camp Fire Girls]] celebrating the 50th anniversary of their founding in 1910]]

The National Conservation Good Turn in 1954 saw Scouts distribute 3.6 million conservation posters, 6.2 million trees, build and place 55,000 bird-nesting boxes, and arrange 41,000 conservation displays.  During the height of the [[Cold War]] in 1958, the BSA delivered 40 million Civil Defense emergency handbooks and distributed 50,000 posters.

1986 saw the Donor Awareness Good Turn: 600,000 youth members distributed 14 million brochures to families, informing them of the needs for organ donations.  In 1997, the [[President of the United States]] called for an increase in volunteer service in the U.S.  The BSA developed Service to America with a commitment to provide 200 million hours of service by youth members by the end of the year 2000.  As part of Service to America, the BSA provided service projects in conjunction with the [[National Park Service]] (NPS).  In October 2003, the [[Department of the Interior]] expanded the program with the creation of Take Pride in America, opening service to all Americans.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.takepride.gov/index.cfm | title =Take Pride in America | format = | work = | publisher =Department of the Interior | accessdate =2006-03-30}}</ref>

The BSA developed Good Turn for America in 2004 to address the problems of hunger, homelessness and inadequate housing and poor health in conjunction with the [[Salvation Army]], the [[American Red Cross]], and [[Habitat for Humanity]].<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.goodturnforamerica.org/ | title =Good Turn for America | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-03-30}}</ref>

==Advancement and recognition==
{{main|Advancement and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America}}
[[Image:MeritBadgeSash.JPG|Merit badge sash|thumb|100px]]
Advancement is one of the methods used to achieve the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.

Cub Scouts advance through various ranks beginning with the Bobcat Award.  The Tiger Cub, Wolf, Bear, and Webelos Ranks are related to the four handbooks for each membership level.  The Arrow of Light award is the highest rank award available to Cub Scouts and prepares Webelos Scouts for the transition to Boy Scouting.  

There are optional recognitions also available in Cub Scouting.  The Cub Scouts Academics and Sports Program is designed toward the third aim of Scouting:<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/cubscout/a-s.html | title =Cub Scout Academics and Sports Program | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project |  accessdate=2006-03-27}}</ref> the development of physical, mental and emotional fitness.

Advancement for Boy Scouts has two phases.  The first phase of new Scout to First Class is designed to teach the boy [[Scoutcraft]] skills, how to participate in a group and to learn self-reliance.  Scout is the joining badge, and is awarded when the Scout demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of the Scouting ideals.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank1.html | title =Boy Scout Joining Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project |  accessdate=2006-03-23}}</ref>  Tenderfoot,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank2.html | title =Tenderfoot Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2006-03-23}}</ref> Second Class,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank3.html | title =Second Class Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2006-03-23}}</ref> and First Class<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank4.html | title =First Class Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project|accessdate=2006-03-23}}</ref> have progressively harder requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and [[Scout Spirit]]. The second half of advancement for Star, Life and [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]  are based on career and avocation exploration through [[Merit Badge]]s, leadership responsibility in the troop, and performing service projects for the public good. After becoming an Eagle Scout, a Scout can be awarded Eagle Palms (first Bronze, then Gold, then Silver). A palm is earned by completing an additional five merit badges and demonstrating that he has upheld the ideals of Eagle Scout.

Although [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] is the highest rank and one all Scouts should strive for, the number of Scouts achieving First Class within one year of joining is still one of the key measures of unit effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://webpages.charter.net/fptroop8/Troop%20Handbook.htm | title =Troop Handbook | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scout Troop 8 | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006| url =http://scouting.org/filestore/pdf/34118.pdf | title =First Class-First Year Tracking Sheet| format = PDF | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>  Studies have shown that if a Scout achieves First Class within a year of joining, he typically stays in Scouting for at least three years. Scouts who do so are more likely to retain Scout values as an adult and achieve the BSA primary mission of "producing useful citizens".

Varsity Scouts can earn any award or recognition that is available to Boy Scouts, including merit badges, rank advancements, and other awards.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/intro.html | title =Boy Scout Advancement| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>   The Varsity Letter may be earned by participating in or accomplishing at least one high adventure or sports program, according to guidelines determined by the Varsity Coach, meeting attendance requirements and showing [[Scout Spirit]].  The Denali Award is the highest award in Varsity Scouting.

Venturers may earn a Bronze Award from a category of arts and hobbies, outdoor, religious life, Sea Scouting, or sports.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/BronzeAwardFacts.html | title =Bronze Award Fact Sheet| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> After earning at least one Bronze Award and meeting tenure, leadership, personal growth and other requirements the Venturer may earn the Gold Award. To earn the [[Silver (Venturing)|Silver Award]] the Venturer must earn the Gold Award, earn first aid and CPR certifications, show leadership and participate in ethics training.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/GoldAwardFacts.html | title =Gold Award Fact Sheet| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/SilverAwardFacts.html | title =Silver Award Overview| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>   Venturers may also earn expert awards that build on some areas of the Bronze Awards. These include the Venturing Ranger Award (outdoors),<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/RangerAwardFacts.html | title =Ranger Award Fact Sheet| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> the TRUST Award (religious life) and the Quest Award (sports). 

There are also a number of optional recognitions available to Venturers, including the Venturing World Conservation Award, the Venturing Leadership Award, and the Venturing Shooting Sports Outstanding Achievement Award.

Sea Scouting has a rank progression of Apprentice, Ordinary, Able, and Quartermaster.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/Quartermaster.html| title =Quartermaster| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>  Sea Scouts may also earn any Venturing award.  Advanced certifications include Qualified Seaman, Small Boat Handler, the Long Cruise Badge and Sea Scout Advanced Leader (SEAL).

Adult leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/awards.asp| title =Awards: Adult Leaders| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref><ref name="ldrtrng"/>  The Cub Scouter Award is available to any Cub Scout leader, while the Tiger Cub Den Leader Award, Cub Scout Den Leader Award, Webelos Den Leader Award and the Cubmaster Award are available to those who have held the respective positions.  The Scouters Training Award is available to any Boy Scout leader, while the Scouter's Key and Scoutmaster Award of Merit are only available to the Scoutmaster.  Varsity leaders may earn the Varsity Letter and activity pins as well as any Boy Scout leader awards.  The Venturing Leader's Training Award and the Venturing Leadership Award are available to any Venturing leader, while the Venturing Advisor's Key and Venturing Advisor Award of Merit are only available to the Advisor.  The highest recognition for Scout leader training is [[Wood Badge]] for all Scouters and [[Sea Badge]] for Sea Scouters.

A wide variety of [[religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)|religious emblems programs]] are administered by various religious institutions for their members.  These awards are recognized, but not sponsored, by the BSA.

==Uniform and insignia==

The Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America gives [[Scouting|Scouts]] visibility  and creates a level of identity within both the unit and the community.  The uniform is used to promote equality while showing individual achievement.  While all uniforms are similar in basic design, they do vary in color and detail to identify the different divisions of Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, Varsity Scouting, Venturing and Sea Scouting<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peterson, Robert |year=2002 |title=From Doughboy Duds to Oscar de la Renta |journal=Scouting Magazine |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0210/d-wwas.html |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2006-01-12}}</ref>

In 1969, as a tribute to [[Norman Rockwell]]'s 75th birthday that year, officials of {{nowrap|[[Brown & Bigelow]]}} and the Boy Scouts of America asked Rockwell to pose in ''Beyond the Easel'', the BSA's calendar illustration. Later, as part of the [[United States Bicentennial|U.S. Bicentennial]] celebrations in 1976, Rockwell's Scouting paintings toured the nation and were viewed by 280,000 people.<ref>{{cite book |  author = [[William Hillcourt]] | title = Norman Rockwell's World of Scouting | publisher = Harry N.

===Membership controversies===
{{details|Boy Scouts of America membership controversies}}
