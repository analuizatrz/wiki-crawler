'''''Man Enters the Cosmos''''' is a cast [[bronze]] [[sculpture]] by [[Henry Moore]] located outside the [[National Historic Landmark]], [[National Register of Historic Places]] [[Adler Planetarium]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago, IL|Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].<ref name=PAG>{{cite web |url=http://www.winterdelights.com/pdfs/publicart.pdf |month=April|year=2005|type=PDF |title=The Chicago Public Art Guide |author=City of Chicago Department of Public Affairs |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref><ref name=SI>{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=119UE944E5662.127&profile=ariall&uri=link=3100009~!1462394~!3100001~!3100002&aspect=Browse&menu=search&ri=2&source=~!siartinventories&term=Man+Enters+the+Cosmos%2C&index=ALTIT|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=2004|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|title=Art Inventories Catalogue (Man Enters the Cosmos)}}</ref>  It is [[work of art]] created in the form of a functional [[sundial]] in 1980.  This sculpture measures approximately {{height|ft=13}}.<ref name=SI/>  This sundial is a bowstring equatorial sundial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2006/The-Annotated-Adler/|year=2006|month=July|accessdate=2007-09-30|publisher=Chicago Magazine|title=The Annotated: Adler|author=Meyer, Graham}}</ref> The sundial was formerly located slightly further south at the main entry plaza to the Planetarium.<ref name=PAG/>  

This type of sundial is known as an equatorial sundial because the plane of the dial face is parallel to the earth's [[equatorial plane]]. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundials.org/faq/types/equatorial.htm|accessdate=2007-09-30|publisher=North American Sundial Society|title=Equatorial}}</ref>  Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year round on the same surface regardless of whether the [[Sun]] is above or below the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each [[equinox]] and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/exo/sundials/equatorial_sundials.html|accessdate=2007-09-30|date=2007|publisher=Walter Sanford - Sandburg Center for Sky Awareness|title=Equatorial Sundials}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1289715|title=Equatorial sundial|accessdate=2007-09-30|publisher=The Everything Development Company|date=2002-04-23}}</ref>

The sundial has two plaques on its base.  The one on the left is a commemorative one discussing the benefactor and purpose of the sculpture, which was to recognize the [[space exploration]] program.  The one on the right is an [[equation of time]] table to correct for the time differences caused by the [[axial tilt]] of the [[Earth]] as well as its [[orbital eccentricity]].  The sculpture is composed of two bronze semicircles, one set inside and at right angles to the other and a slim bronze rod that extends from one end of the outer semicircle to the other that serves as the [[gnomon]].  The shadow of the rod projects onto the inner semicircle, which serves as the dial face, to mark the time of day.<ref name=SI/>  Over the course of the year different sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time.  At the summer [[solstice]] when the sun is highest the style is closest to the top of the rod and at the winter solstice it is closest to the bottom.  At the equinoxes it is exactly in the center of the length of the rod.

Moore use to take pride in viewing his sculptures in the open air environment,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D9103FF936A35755C0A96F948260|accessdate=2007-06-07|date=1989-06-05|title= Review/Art; Moore Sculptures in a Kansas City Garden|author=Russell, John|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref> and in Chicago, Moore has a total of four public sculptures on display.
