The '''European Union''' ('''EU''') is a [[sui generis]] [[supernationalism|supranational]] and [[intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] union of 27 [[state]]s. It was established in 1992 by the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] (The Maastricht Treaty), and is the de facto successor to the six-member [[European Economic Community]] founded in [[1957]]. Since then new [[Enlargement of the European Union|accessions]] have raised its number of [[European Union member states|member states]], and competences have expanded.  The EU is the current stage of a continuing open-ended process of [[European integration]]. 

The EU is one of the largest economic and political entities in the world, with 493 million people and a combined nominal GDP of €11.5 ($15.0) trillion in 2006.<ref>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1996,39140985&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&product=EU_economy_finance&root=EU_economy_finance/economy/main/overview/yearlies/B1/B11/daa10000 GDP], Eurostat (Accessed March 17, 2007)</ref> The Union is a [[single market]]<ref>EUROPA: ''Activities of the European Union: Internal Market.''

The EU initiated a limited [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], and a limited [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]].

Important EU institutions and bodies include the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Council]], the [[European Central Bank]], the [[European Court of Justice]], and the [[European Parliament]]. Citizens of EU member states are also [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]]: they [[direct election|directly elect]] the European Parliament, once every five years. They can live, travel, work, and invest in other member states (with some restrictions on new member states). Passport control and customs checks at most internal borders were abolished by the [[Schengen Agreement]].<ref> See [http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/freetravel/frontiers/fsj_freetravel_schengen_en.htm Abolition of internal borders and creation of a single EU external frontier]", Europa.

==History==
{{main|History of the European Union}}
[[Image:RobetSchuman.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Robert Schuman]]]]
The EU has evolved from a western European trade body into the supranational and intergovernmental body that it is today. After the [[Second World War]], an impetus grew in western [[Europe]] for institutional forms of cooperation (through social, political and economic integration) between states, driven by the determination to rebuild Europe and eliminate the possibility of another [[World War]]. Eastern Europe, on the other hand, was largely within the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[sphere of influence]], and only in the 1990s did the EU see central and eastern European states as potential members.

In [[1946]] [[Winston Churchill]] called for a "United States of Europe" (though without the inclusion of the UK).<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=65 Winston Churchill], www.winstonchurchill.org .Accessed January 25, 2007</ref>  On [[May 9]] [[1950]], the French foreign minister [[Robert Schuman]] presented a proposal for the joint management of France's and West Germany's coal and steel industries. The proposal, known as the "[[Schuman Declaration]]", envisaged the scheme as "the first concrete step towards a European federation".<ref>[http://europa.eu.int/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm]</ref>  It is considered to be the beginning of the creation of what is now the European Union, and led to the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] by [[Germany|(West) Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[Benelux]] countries. This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed in 1951.<ref>[http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm History of the European Union], Europa. Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> [[Image:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The founding nations signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957]]

The first full [[customs union]] - the ''European Economic Community'' (the Common Market) - was established by the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 and implemented on [[1 January]] [[1958]]. This later changed to the ''European Community'', which is now the "first pillar" of the European Union created by the [[Maastricht treaty]].  

On [[29 October]] [[2004]], EU member state heads of government and state [[signature|signed]] the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]]. This was later ratified by 17 member states. However, in most cases ratification was based on parliamentary action, rather than popular vote, and the process faltered on [[29 May]] [[2005]] when French voters rejected the constitution 55% to 45%. [[French referendum on the European Constitution|The French rejection]] was followed three days later by a [[Dutch referendum on the European Constitution|Dutch]] one, in which 62% of voters refused the constitution as well.

==Geography==
[[Image:Beachthehague.JPG|thumb|200px|right|22 member countries are influenced by extensive coastlines and oceanic climate ([[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]])]]
{{main|Geography of the European Union|Geography of Europe}}

The territory of the European Union is formed by the territory of its twenty-seven member states, and expands with the accession of new members. It covers an area of 4,422,773 [[square kilometre]]s (1,707,642&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]).<ref name=Area.and.population.figure>Figure including the four [[overseas department|French overseas departments]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]]) which are an integral part of the European Union, but excluding the [[Overseas collectivity|French overseas collectivities]] and [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]], which are not part of the European Union.</ref> Extending northeast to Finland, northwest to Ireland, southeast to Cyprus and southwest to Portugal, it represents the [[List of countries by area|seventh largest territory in the world by area]]. It is estimated that the coastline of the European Union is over 150,000 km long.

The EU is not coterminous with Europe: significant parts of the continent (e.g. [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], European [[Russia]]) are outside of the EU. The member states of the EU have [[countries bordering the European Union|land borders]] with 21 other nations. Several overseas territories and dependencies of various member states are also formally part of the EU (e.g. the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] or the [[Canary Islands]]) while in other cases territories associated with member states are not part of the EU (e.g. [[Greenland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], most territories associated to the United Kingdom, [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] or [[New Caledonia]]).

Including overseas territories of member states, the EU includes most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] to [[Tropical climate|tropical]]. Meteorological averages for the EU as a whole are therefore not meaningful. The majority of the population live in areas with a [[Mediterranean climate]] (southern Europe), a temperate [[maritime climate]] (western Europe), or a [[Hemiboreal|warm summer continental or hemiboreal]] climate (in eastern member states).

The EU describes itself as "a family of democratic European countries".<ref name="panorama" /> 
On [[23 July]] [[1952]], six founding members formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), which was transformed into the [[European Community]], later renamed to European Union, in waves of accession:

==Politics==
[[Image:Jose Manuel BarrosoCROPPED.jpg|thumb|160px|The [[President of the European Commission]] [[José Manuel Barroso]]]]
{{main|Politics of the European Union|Three pillars of the European Union}}

Supporters of the European Union argue that the growth of the EU is a force for [[peace]], [[democracy]], and [[prosperity]] for its member states. However, the [[Democratic peace theory|causal factors of war and peace]] are a controversial theoretical issue. Others contend that peace in Europe since [[World War II]] is the product of other causes, such as the moderating influence of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] within their respective power [[bloc]]s, and the mutual external threat for the other bloc/alliance, the need for reconstruction after World War II, and a collective temporary tiring of waging war, and that the dictatorships cited came to an end for entirely different reasons.

The nature and future direction of the European Union itself is the central issue in pan-European politics, and a significant issue in the national politics of the member states. General issues include the ultimate size of the Union, limits on new accession, the pace of new accessions, expansion in membership versus internal integration, a future as a [[political union]] versus a future as a [[free trade zone]], the geographical limits of "Europe" for membership purposes, and the values and historical-cultural identity of the Union. Internal structure, procedures and policies are themselves subject to constant political debate. Specific issues at present include the status and future of the [[European Constitution|constitutional treaty]]; [[enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] on the [[Balkans]] and [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkish accession]]; problems of financial probity and [[democratic deficit|democratic accountability]]; relative economic viability; revision of the rules of the [[Stability and Growth Pact]]; and the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].

The 'pillar' structure created by the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] moved the older policies and activities into the 'first pillar, labeled the 'European Communities'. The more controversial new policy areas - foreign policy, security and defence, asylum and immigration, and judicial co-operation - were moved into two new 'pillars'.

===European Economic Community===
[[Image:Euro_banknotes.png|thumb|200px|right|The [[Euro]] has been adopted by 13 countries]]
{{main|European Community}}

The most prominent policy goal of the European Union is the development and maintenance of an effective [[single market]]. Significant efforts have been made to create harmonised standards designed to bring economic benefits through creating larger, more efficient markets. Since the Treaty of Rome, policies have implemented [[free trade]] of goods and services among member states, and continue to do so. This policy goal was further extended to three of the four [[EFTA]] states by the [[European Economic Area]], EEA. Common [[EU competition law]] restricts anti-competitive activities of companies (through antitrust law and merger control) and member states (through the State Aids regime). The EU promotes free movement of [[financial capital|capital]] between member states (and other EEA states). The members have a common system of indirect [[taxation]], the [[VAT]], as well as common customs duties and excises on various products. They have a [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (with the [[Common Fisheries Policy]]) and the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|structural and cohesion funds]], which improve infrastructure and assist disadvantaged regions. Together they are known as the ''cohesion policies.'' The EU also has funds for emergency financial aid, for instance after natural disasters. The funding extends to programmes in candidate countries and other [[Eastern Europe]]an countries, as well as aid to many developing countries, through programmes such as [[Phare]], [[TACIS]], [[Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession|ISPA]]. The EU also funds research and technological development, through four-year [[Seventh Framework Programme|Framework Programmes]] for Research and Technological Development.

In a more political sense, the EU attempts to create - with much controversy - a sense of European citizenship and European political life. That includes freedom for citizens of the EU to vote and to stand as candidates in local government and [[European Parliament]] elections in any member state.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/youreurope/nav/en/citizens/citizenship/citizenship/index.html European citizenship], Europa. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> The [[European Parliament]] is now attempting to create pan-European political parties, and almost all members have joined at least a federation of national political parties.

===Common Foreign & Security Policy===
[[Image:Condisolana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Javier Solana]], the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative for the CFSP]] (l.) and [[Condoleezza Rice]]]]
{{Main|Common Foreign and Security Policy|European Security and Defence Policy}}

Defence and security are traditionally matters of national [[sovereignty]]. 
EU policies in this area were established as the second of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] in the [[Maastricht treaty]] of 1992. The ''Common Foreign and Security Policy'' or CFSP were further defined and broadened in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of 1997. It superseded the [[European Political Cooperation]]. The CFSP acknowledges [[NATO]] being responsible for territorial defence of Europe and "peace-making". In 1999 the [[European Council]] took over responsibilities for the implementation  of peace-keeping missions ([[EUFOR]] in Bosnia Herzegovina, Congo) and policing of treaties.  The supervision is coordinated by the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]], [[Javier Solana]].

The [[European Security and Defence Policy]] is an element of the  CFSP and stipulated the framing for policies that could deal with humanitarian and rescue tasks, and tasks of combat forces. It includes the creation of a 60,000-member [[European Rapid Reaction Force]] for [[peacekeeping]] purposes, an EU [[military]] staff, a [[European Defence Agency]] and an EU [[satellite]] centre (for intelligence purposes).

===Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters===
{{Main|Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters}}
The third of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] of the European Union is focusing on cooperation in criminal matters, including sharing of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] (through [[Europol]] and the [[Schengen Information System]]), agreement on common definition of [[crime|criminal offences]] and expedited [[extradition]] procedures.
It is the EU instrument of [[law]] enforcement and combating [[racism]]. 

It was created as the ''Justice and Home Affairs'' pillar in the [[Treaty of Maastricht]]; subsequently the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] transferred the areas of illegal [[immigration]], [[visa (document)|visas]], [[refugee|asylum]], and judicial co-operation to the integrated first ([[European Community]]) pillar.   The term ''Justice and Home Affairs'' now covers these integrated fields as well as the intergovernmental third pillar.

==Institutions and bodies==
[[Image:European parliament.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Brussels seat of Parliament]]
{{Main|Institutions of the European Union}}

The European Union is governed by a number of institutions, these primarily being the [[European Commission|Commission]], [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and [[European Parliament|Parliament]].

The '''[[European Commission]]''' acts as an [[executive branch|executive]] or [[civil service]] of sorts. It is currently composed of one member from each state (currently 27) and is responsible for drafting all proposed law, a duty on which it maintains a monopoly in order to co-ordinate European Law. It also controls some agencies and the day-to-day running of the Union. Its president is nominated by the European Council then elected by the Parliament.

The '''[[Council of the European Union]]''' (aka the Council of Ministers) forms one half of the Union's [[legislative branch]] (the other being the Parliament). It is composed of the national ministers responsible for the area of EU law being addressed, for example a law regarding agriculture would go to a Council composed of national agriculture ministers. This body should not to be confused with the [[European Council]] below or the non-EU body, the [[Council of Europe]]. The body's presidency rotates between the member-states every 6 months, though the current president member-state co-operates with the previous and future president member-state, to provide continuity.

The '''[[European Parliament]]''' is the only Union body composed of officials directly elected on European issues. Every 5 years citizens in all member-states vote across a few days for 785 "[[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]]" who form the second half of the Union's legislative branch. Its members sit according to political groups rather than nationality and its president is elected by its members.
[[Image:Eurotower in Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The [[European Central Bank]] in Frankfurt]]
The '''[[European Central Bank]]''' is controlling the [[monetary policy]] within the [[Eurozone]], consisting of 13 member states. The ECB was established in [[1998]] and its headquarters are located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. 

The [[Judicial branch]] of the Union consists primarily of the '''[[European Court of Justice]]''' composed of one judge nominated by each member-state with the president elected from among those nominees. Below the Court of Justice there is a lower court called the '''[[Court of First Instance]]''' created to lift some of the work load of the Court of Justice. There is also the '''[[European Court of Auditors]]''' which monitors the Union's accounts.

Another major body, though not an official institution, is the '''[[European Council]]''', composed of the heads of government (along with the [[President of the European Commission]]) meeting 4 times a year. It shares its presidency with that of the Council of the European Union. There are also the   two [[Advisory bodies to the European Union|advisory committees]]; the [[Committee of the Regions]] and the [[Economic and Social Committee]].

There is no official European capital, with institutions spread across a number of cities. However, Brussels is often considered the ''de facto'' capital as it hosts most of the primary institutions, including the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]].

[[Strasbourg]] is the official seat of the [[European Parliament]], meeting there for twelve week-long plenary sessions each year.

==Law==
[[Image:EUCoJ.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[European Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]]]
{{main|European Union law}}

European Union law is the first and only example of a [[supranationalism|supranational]] legal framework. According to the [[European Court of Justice]], in one of its earliest cases, it constitutes "a new legal order of international law".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML Van Gend en Loos v. Nederlanse Administratie Der Belastingen], EU-LEX, Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> Sovereign [[nation states]], by becoming EU members, pool their authority for the mutual social and economic benefit of their peoples. The principle of [[subsidiarity]] means that laws are passed at the regional level where they are more effective when member states take action by themselves, while EU law is supreme in its own fields.

The two main treaties which form the basis of EU law are the Treaty of the European Community, or the [[Treaty of Rome]] from 1957, and the Treaty of the European Union, or the [[Maastricht treaty]] of 1992. The Treaty of Rome is the so called 'first pillar' of the EU. The "European Community" refers to the competence of the EU to act in the social and economic arena. The Maastricht treaty formed the new European Union, and added two further "pillars". These are a common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs. In both these fields a consensus among member states is needed to act. 
[[Image:Consttreat.jpg|left|thumb|200px|In 2004, [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|the constitutional treaty]] was [[Signatories to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|signed]] in Rome by representatives of all [[List of European Union member states|EU member states]]. Subsequently, it was [[Ratification|ratified]] by 15 member states, and rejected in [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|French]] and [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|Dutch]] referenda.]]
EU law covers a range as broad as many member states themselves.<ref>see Article 3 TEU for a list</ref> Where a conflict arises between EU law and the law of a member state, EU law takes precedence, so that the law of a member state must be disapplied.<ref>in general, see C 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v. ENEL'' [1964] ECR 585, 593; in the UK see, [[Factortame case|''Factortame Ltd. v Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603'']]; in Germany see ''Solange II'' (''Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft'', BVerfG decision of 22 Oct. 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265); in Italy see ''Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; in France see, Raoul George Nicolo [1990] 1 CMLR 173</ref> Both the provisions of the Treaties, and EU regulations are said to have "[[direct effect]]" horizontally. This means private citizens can rely on the rights granted to them (and the duties created for them) against one another. For instance, an air hostess may sue her aeroplane company employer for sexual discrimination.<ref>under Art. 141 TEC, C-43/75 ''Defrenne v. Sabena'' [1976] ECR 455</ref> The other main legal instrument of the EU, "directives", have direct effect, but only "vertically". Private citizens may not sue one another on the basis of an EU directive, since these are meant to be addressed to the member state. Directives allow some choice for member states in the way they translate a directive into national law. Once this has happened citizens may rely on the law that has been implemented. They may only sue the government "vertically" for failing to implement a directive correctly. An example of a directive is the [[Product liability]] Directive,<ref>85/374/EEC</ref> which makes companies liable for death and any other injuries that occur.

==Foreign relations==
[[Image:Peter Mandelson.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Peter Mandelson]], Commissioner of Trade, represents the bloc in the [[WTO]]]]
{{main|Foreign relations of the European Union}}

The Union's foreign relations are primarily conducted on an inter-governmental basis, with enlargement being a key instrument with its neighbours. In extending its influence to the east, it has accepted several new members that were previously behind the [[Iron Curtain]]. It is hoped that in a similar fashion to the entry of Spain, Portugal and Greece in the [[1980s]], membership for these states will help cement economic and political stability. Western European States not in the Union are still deeply involved in integration, for example through the [[European Economic Area]] or bilateral, and this is the primary influence on relations with these States.

On the world stage the Union is gaining greater influence and ability to speak as a bloc. All 27 member states are represented in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) through its [[European Commissioner for Trade|Trade Commissioner]], [[Peter Mandelson]]. The latest [[Doha round|WTO negotiation round]] has currently stalled, partly due to European refusal to curtail the agricultural subsidies unless other developed countries would also stop subsidising their agricultural producers. The Commission is also represented in bodies such as the [[United Nations]] and [[G8]]. Being itself based on the idea of multi-lateralism it has consistently supported international organisations and have been a major proponent of the [[International Criminal Court]] and the [[Kyoto protocol]].
[[Image:Knut IMG 8095.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[European Council]] has officially adopted the Berlin born polar bear [[Knut (polar bear)|Knut]]. He is currently the "animal ambassador" for the rotating presidency of [[Germany]].]]
The Union is allied with the [[United States]], in part through some joint membership with the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO). The relationship with the United States has been strained in recent years through diverging foreign polices, especially concerning [[Iraq]], the [[War on terror]], and [[Human rights]] issues. There is also some friction between the EU and the US caused by different opinions on how to deal with [[global warming]] (e.g. the United States' refusal to sign the [[Kyoto protocol]]). Some individual member-state governments have backed the United States which has caused friction within the Union. 

The Union's increasing power as a single block on the world stage (most clearly after the recent enlargement and the introduction of the euro) has meant that some European Union politicians are more willing to stand up to the United States on issues of disgareement.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} 

Relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] are becoming more important, with both the Union and China rising considerable in power. Human rights issues in China remain of considerable concern for the Union, with an [[European Union arms embargo on China|arms embargo]] being in place since 1989. Nevertheless, cooperation is high on the agenda. China is, for example, participating in the [[Galileo positioning system]] project.

==Enlargement==
[[Image:EUenl.gif|thumb|right|200px|EU enlargement 1952–2007]]
{{main|Enlargement of the European Union|European Union membership criteria}} 

It all started with the six countries of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in [[1952]]. Today there are 27 [[European Union member states]]. There have been six enlargements, with the largest occurring on [[May 1]], [[2004]], when 10 states joined, and the most recent occurring on [[January 1]], [[2007]], when [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] joined. In order to join the European Union, a state needs to fulfill the economic and political conditions generally known as the [[Copenhagen criteria]] (named after the [[Copenhagen]] summit held in June [[1993]]). These basically require a secular, democratic government, rule of law, and corresponding freedoms and institutions. According to the [[Treaty on European Union|EU Treaty]], any enlargement must be agreed to by every current member state as well as the [[European Parliament]].

'''[[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey is an official candidate]]''' to join the European Union. Turkish European ambitions date back to the 1962 Ankara Agreements, and Turkey started preliminary membership negotiations on [[3 October]] [[2005]]. However, analysts believe [[2015]] is the earliest date the country can join the union because of the large number of economic and social reforms it has to complete, and because the [[2007]]–[[2013|13]] budget does not take into account any of the considerable costs Turkey's accession will involve.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4107919.stm Q&A: Turkey's EU entry talks]", [[BBC News Online]], [[4 October]] [[2005]].

{{main|Economy of the European Union}}

Taken as a single entity, the European Union has the largest economy in the world, with a nominal GDP of €11.5 ($15.0) trillion. The EU economy has grown at around 2% per annum so far this century. In 2006, it is estimated 3.5 million jobs were created in the [[Eurozone]]. [[Germany]], with the EU's largest economy, grew 2.7% in 2006 and is expected to grow at around 2.8% in 2007. The EU's rate of growth is expected to increase — growth for 2007 is expected to be at 2.7% — especially as new member states are poorer than the EU average, and have the capacity to grow at a higher rate.

The European Union is characterized by great regional economic disparities, reflecting the different historical backgrounds of its member states. Even corrected for purchasing power, there is a 12-fold difference between the richest region [[Frankfurt]] and the poorest, [[Nord-Est (development region)|Romania Nord-Est]].<ref> [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/PGP_PRD_CAT_PREREL/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2007/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2007_MONTH_02/1-19022007-DE-AP.PDF Regional GDP per inhabitant in the EU 27 (PDF)], Eurostat,  Accessed March 01, 2007</ref> Commuter effects distort GDP figures for urban areas with large commuting flows, but even when measured at a scale where such distortion does not apply (e.g. Ostösterreich compared to Romania Nord-Est), there is still a 5-to-1 difference between average western European levels and the poorest regions of new member states.

Differences between member states are also significant. GDP per capita is often 10% to 25% higher than the EU average in the "older" western member states, but only comprises one-third to two-thirds of the EU average in most eastern member states, as well as in potential membership candidates such as Croatia, FYR Macedonia and Turkey. By comparison, United States GDP per capita is 50% higher than the EU average: Japanese GDP per capita is approximately 25% higher.<ref>[[Eurostat]] News release166/2006,18 December 2006. ''GDP per capita in purchasing power standards. GDP per capita in the Member States ranged from 48% to 251% of the EU25 average in 2005.''</ref>

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of the European Union}}
The population of the European Union is that of its [[Member states of the European Union|member states]], and changes with each accession (or, more rarely, secession). Each change in membership also affects demographic averages such as [[life expectancy]] and [[fertility rate]]. The total population of all member countries is approximately 494 million inhabitants [[as of 2007|as of January 2007]].<ref name=Area.and.population.figure>Figure including the four [[overseas department|French overseas departments]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]]) which are an integral part of the European Union, but excluding the [[Overseas collectivity|French overseas collectivities]] and [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]], which are not part of the European Union.</ref> Expected short-term accessions (Croatia) will not substantially increase this figure. Growth in the short term is coming from net migration, since deaths outnumbered births in [[2006]]. At 1.47, the EU has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, well below the level required for [[Sub-replacement fertility|replacement]]. After [[2025]], this negative [[natural increase]] will probably exceed net immigration, and (discounting new accessions) population is expected to decline gradually.<ref name="EU25populationprojection">{{PDFlink|[http://intranet.icea.es/pensiones/documentacion/Proy_demog_2004_2050.pdf EU25 population projection]|48.9&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 50174 bytes -->}}, Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

===Largest cities===
{{main|Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|Largest urban areas of the European Union|Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union}}
The European Union is home to more [[Global city|global cities]] than any other region in the world. Over 16 cities with populations over one million inhabitants, counted in its city proper. 
However, different countries deal differently with large cities. The Greek city [[Athens]], for example, has  about 4 million inhabitants, however it has been divided into many municipalities making the city proper of Athens one of the smaller European capitals with about 800.000 inhabitants.
Densely populated regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cites and are now encompassing large metropolitan areas are [[Rhine-Ruhr]] having approximately 10.5 million inhabitants ([[Cologne]], [[Dortmund]],[[Düsseldorf]] et al.), [[Randstad]] approx. 7 million ([[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] et al.), [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Area]] approx. 4 million ([[Frankfurt]], [[Wiesbaden]] et al.) and the [[Upper Silesian Industry Area]] approx. 3.5 million.

===Religion===
{{further|[[Religion in Europe]]}}
The significant religious diversity to be found amongst the populations of EU members reflects their diverse history and culture, and the wider European culture of which they are a part. A nominal majority professes [[Christianity]], predominantly [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Despite this, not all populations have Christian majorities. In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Estonia]], for example, a majority has no religious affiliation.

The recent influx of immigrants to the affluent EU nations has brought in various religions of their native homelands, including [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Baha'i faith|the Baha'i faith]] and [[Sikhism]]. [[Judaism]] has had a long history in Europe and has coexisted with the native populations for centuries, despite centuries of discrimination against Jewish people and several attendant periods of persecution or genocide by European rulers. As the Christian churches have historically wielded much power in Europe, reaction to this has allowed [[secularism]] to plant deep roots on European soil which has contributed to the rise in [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]].

The EU is a secular institution, and God was not mentioned in its proposed constitution, despite pressure from the churches.  Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised the Pope that she will use Germany's EU presidency to try to include a reference to Christianity and God in a revived constitution.  However, this has provoked opposition, not the least in the German press.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5337166.stm</ref>

==Education and science==
[[Image:GalileoPS.jpg|thumb|190px|The [[Galileo positioning system]] has been initiated by the EU and [[European Space Agency|ESA]]]]
{{main|Education in the European Union}}
The [[European Commission]] initiated the [[ERASMUS programme]] for [[higher education]].
It was established in 1987 and forms a major part of the EU [[Socrates programme|Socrates II programme]]. Its name is an abbreviation of "European Region Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students" and has been inspired by the life of [[Desiderius Erasmus]]. It was incorporated into the [[Socrates programme]] when that programme was established in 1995. The Socrates programme ended in 1999 and was replaced with the Socrates II programme in 2000. Other educational programmes include Leonardo (secondary schools), Grundtvig (adult learning) and Arion (teaching decision-makers).

The aim of ERASMUS is to encourage and support [[academic mobility]] of [[higher education]] students and teachers within the European Union, the [[European Economic Area]] countries of [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] as well as the candidate country [[Turkey]]. 2,199 [[higher education]] institutions are participating in ERASMUS across the 31 countries involved in the [[Socrates programme]]. 1.4 million students have already taken part.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Table 8: Actual Number of ERASMUS Students by Country of Home institution 1987/88-2004/05 | url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/socrates/erasmus/statisti/table8.pdf|format=PDF}} Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>
[[Image:1Ariane5LaunchArianespace.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Ariane 5]] is an [[expendable launch system]]]]

Member states of the EU are, along with other European nations and several international NGOs, signatories to  the [[Bologna process]].  This is an attempt to create a [[European higher education area]], by making [[academic degree]] standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout [[Europe]]. It is named after the place it was proposed, the [[University of Bologna]] with the signing, in [[1999]], of the [[Bologna declaration]] by ministers of education from 29 European countries in the Italian city of [[Bologna]]. Governmental meetings have been held in [[Prague]] ([[2001]]), [[Berlin]] ([[2003]]) and [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] ([[2005]]); the next meeting will take place in [[London]] in Spring 2007.

The [[Galileo positioning system]] (or simply 'Galileo'), is a proposed [[Global Navigation Satellite System]], to be built by the European Union and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).
The current project plan has the system as operational by 2010. Several other nations are joining the
project co financing the development such as China, Israel, India, Morocco or South Korea. ESA is a non-EU organisation and its membership includes non-EU countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Norway]]. Both countries ''are'', however, within the [[EFTA]]. There are ties between those organisations, with various agreements in place and being worked on, to establish the legal status of ESA with regard to the EU.<ref>ESA information on its relationship to the EU. [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFEPYV1SD_index_0.html]</ref> There are common goals between ESA and the EU, and ESA has an EU liaison office in Brussels.

==Culture and identity==
[[Image:Sibiuphoto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two cities are the [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2007 ([[Sibiu]])]]
{{main|Cultural policies of the European Union}}

Supporters of [[European integration]] often appeal to a European historical narrative, typically including [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], the [[feudalism]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], 19th century [[Liberalism]] and (sometimes) negative elements such as the [[World Wars]]. This history is assumed to be the source of European values. The status of [[Christianity]] as 'European heritage' is controversial, and has consequences for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]]. The [[European Convention]] rejected inclusion of a reference in the proposed [[European Constitution]] to Christianity and/or God. The text finally adopted in the [[wikisource:Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: Preamble|Preamble]] reads:

:''DRAWING INSPIRATION from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, from which have developed the universal values of the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law,...''

Attitudes and values of the EU population are very diverse, influenced by [[social class]], religion, level of education, and [[ethnicity]], and they are not necessarily either European or national in character. The interests of member [[state]]s are mainly economic and political in nature.

There is no single culture or lifestyle common to the entire EU population. Some are local, national or regional. There are aspects of popular culture which can be found all over the EU, such as [[Football (soccer)|football]], but none are limited to the EU (they may be equally influential in non-member states in Europe, and some are global).
[[Image:Luxembourg0080.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The cultural capitals are designated for a period of one year ([[Luxembourg]])]]
The member states have been traditionally reluctant to lose control of cultural policy, given the central role of culture in [[national identity]]. Cultural cooperation  ''between'' member states has become a community competency since its inclusion in [[1992]] in the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Actions taken in the cultural area by the European Union include the [[Culture 2000]] 7-year programme, the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme, the [[European Cultural Month]] event, the [[Media Plus]] programme, experimental actions and the awarding of various grants.

The European Union gave grants to 233 cultural projects in 2004 and launched a webportal dedicated to Europe and Culture, responding to the [[European Council]]'s expressed desire to see the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by the most advanced technological means."

===Sport===
[[Image:Campnoumatch.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular sport in Europe ([[:en:Nou Camp |Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]])]]
{{main|Sport policies of the European Union}}

Sports, including [[spectator sports]], are popular in EU countries: the most popular is [[Football (soccer)|football]]. [[Cycling]], [[tennis]], and [[field hockey]] are also widely watched and played in the EU. Other sports are favorites in fewer countries, such as [[ice hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[handball]], and [[motorsports]]; and several sports are unique to one or a few countries (e.g. [[cricket]] in the UK and [[korfball]] in the Netherlands and Belgium).

Although it recently launched an anti-doping convention, the European Union plays a minor and mostly indirect role in sport policy. Sports are normally considered to be outside the [[principle of conferral|competences conferred]] by the member states to the European Union. Sports are also organized nationally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally. The European Union does not have specific sports policies. The role of the EU could increase, if (for example) the [[European Constitution]] were to be ratified.

Yet other policies of the EU can have an impact on sports, as famously exemplified by the [[Bosman ruling]], which, among other things, prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players from other EU states. This ruling subsequently forced [[UEFA]] to modify the rules for all its European members.

The EU provides [[Directorate-General for Interpretation (European Commission)|interpretation]], [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|translation]] and [[Publications Office (European Union)|publication services]] in its official languages, but only legislation and important documents are produced in all 23 official languages; other documents are translated only into the languages needed. For internal purposes the EU institutions make their own language arrangements. The European Commission, for example, conducts its internal business in English, French and German, and goes fully multilingual only for public information and communication purposes. The European Parliament, on the other hand, has members who need working documents in their own languages, so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset.<ref>[http://europa.eu/languages/en/document/59#5 Europa:Languages and Europe.

==Infrastructure and environment==
[[Image:DanishWindTurbines.jpg|thumb|right|290px|The  EU is one of the leading regions in [[Research and development|R & D]] of [[renewable energy]] (Offshore wind farm near [[Copenhagen]])]]
The EU has a policy to improve cross-border infrastructure, see [[Trans-European Networks]].

The European Union has legislated in the area of energy policy for many years, and evolved out of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The concept of introducing a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] on October 27, [[2005]] in [[London]].

The EU currently imports 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]], making it the world's leading importer of these fuels.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/ 'Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe], www.msnbc.msn.com . Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

The EU has enacted a series of directives concerning wastewater treatment, drinking water and water resources management that have a profound impact on water and sanitation infrastructure investments in EU member countries (see [[EU water policy]]). In particular the wastewater directive is considered by the European Commission the most cost intensive European legislation in the environmental sector.
