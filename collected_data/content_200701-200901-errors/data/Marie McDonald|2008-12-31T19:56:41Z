'''Marie McDonald''' (July 6, 1923 â€“ October 21, 1965) was an [[United States|American]] singer and actress known as "The Body".

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born '''Cora Marie Frye''' in [[Burgin, Kentucky]], she was the daughter of a [[Ziegfeld Follies]] girl. After her parents divorced, she eventually moved with her mother and stepfather to [[Yonkers, New York]]. At the age of 15, McDonald began modeling and competed in numerous beauty pageants and was crowned Miss New York in 1939.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Barry |coauthors=Van Doren, Mamie|title=Atomic Blonde: The Films of Mamie Van Doren|publisher=McFarland|date=2008|pages=35|isbn=0-786-43138-5}}</ref> At 17, she landed a [[showgirl]] role in a 1940 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production at the [[Earl Carroll Theatre]] called ''Earl Carroll's Vanities.'' Shortly thereafter, she moved to [[Hollywood]] hoping to develop a career in [[show business]]. She continued to work for the owner of the Broadway theatre as a showgirl at his [[Sunset Boulevard]] nightclub. 

===Career===
Marie McDonald's singing voice brought work with [[Tommy Dorsey]] & His Orchestra on his radio show and she later performed with other [[Big band]]s. In 1942, she was put under contract by [[Universal Studios]] and immediately appeared in several minor roles. That year, she appeared in three motion pictures, most notably, ''[[Pardon My Sarong]]'', which earned her the nickname "The Body" for her shapely physique.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ayto|first=John |coauthors=Cobham, Ebenezer; Crofton, Ian|title=Brewer's Dictionary of Modern Phrase & Fable|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|date=2006|pages=96|isbn=0-304-36809-1}}</ref> The following year she co-starred in ''A Scream in the Dark'', a [[B movies|"B"]] detective mystery for [[Republic Pictures]] that met with reasonable success. However, that would be it as far as starring roles until 1945 when she worked for a small independent production company in another "B" film called ''Getting Gertie's Garter''. She costarred with [[Gene Kelly]] in [[MGM]]'s ''[[Living in a Big Way]]'' (1947).

During [[World War II]], McDonald was a volunteer [[pin-up girl]] for the [[United States military]] magazine, ''[[YANK]]''. She had married for the first time in 1940 but this marriage quickly ended. Her second marriage, to her agent Vic Orsatti, lasted four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/213/Vic+Orsatti/index.html|title=The Private Life and Times of Vic Orsatti|publisher=glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com|accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref> In all, she married seven times, including twice to Harry Karl, who later married [[Debbie Reynolds]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James Robert |coauthors=Bowers, Ronald L. |title=The MGM Stock Company: The Golden Era|publisher=Arlington House|date=1973|pages=607|isbn=0-711-00501-X}}</ref> McDonald's tumultuous personal life soon overshadowed her career. Tabloids regularly reported on her numerous marriages, car accidents, and an escape from an Australian psychiatric clinic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941512,00.html|title=Milestones|date=1965-10-29|publisher=''Time''|accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref> She also made headlines when, in 1957, she claimed she was kidnapped by two men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2007/08/fuzzy-pink-nigh.html|title=Fuzzy Pink Nightgown|last=Harnisch|first=Larry |date=2007-08-23|publisher=latimesblogs.latimes.com|accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref> 

Despite various personal problems, McDonald recorded an LP for [[RCA Victor]] in 1957, ''The Body Sings'', backed by Hal Borne and His Orchestra, which consisted of twelve standard ballads.  She also toured the world in a very successful nightclub act. Between 1945 and 1950 she appeared in only two films and then again not until 1958 when she was cast in a [[slapstick comedy]] opposite [[Jerry Lewis]] in ''[[The Geisha Boy]]''. In 1963, she made her last appearance in the film, ''[[Promises! Promises!]]'', opposite [[Jayne Mansfield]].

===Death===
In 1965, McDonald was found dead of a [[drug overdose]] in her [[Calabasas, California]] home. She was laid to rest in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Willis|first=John |title=Screen World, 1966|publisher=Biblo & Tannen Publishers|date=1966|pages=239|isbn=0-819-60307-4}}</ref>  

Three months after McDonald's death, her sixth husband Donald F. Taylor, who had occasionally acted under the name Don Taylor, committed suicide in January 1966. McDonald's three surviving children were raised by Harry Karl and his wife, Debbie Reynolds.
