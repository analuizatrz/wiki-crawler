'''Tulsa''' is the second-largest city in the U.S. state of [[Oklahoma]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Tulsa County, Oklahoma|Tulsa County]], the most densely populated county in Oklahoma, with 563,299 residents as of 2000.  As of 2006, the estimate for the city population was 387,807.<ref>  http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/40/4075000.html Tulsa (city) QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau] [Census Bureau]</ref> Tulsa’s [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] was estimated to have a 2005 population of 887,715 and Tulsa’s [[Combined Statistical Area]], which includes the Bartlesville Micropolitan Area, was estimated to have a 2005 population of 936,864. Tulsa is the 45th largest city in the [[United States]] and the 93rd largest city in [[North America]]. 

The city is located in Northeast Oklahoma, a part of the state often referred to as "[[Green Country]]." It is considered the cultural and arts center of Oklahoma, boasting two world-renowned art museums, full-time professional opera and ballet companies, and a notable concentration of [[art deco]] architecture. <ref name="Quality of Life">{{cite web | date=2006 | url=http://www.okcommerce.gov/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=332&Itemid=413 | title= Quality of Life - Fun and Play| format=web | work=Oklahoma Department of Commerce| pages=1 | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Commerce | language=English | accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref> In 2005, Tulsa was selected as one of "America's Most Livable Large Cities." <ref name="Most Livable">{{cite web | date=2006 | url=http://www.mostlivable.org/cities/tulsa/home.html| title= Tulsa, Oklahoma | format=web | work=Most Livable| pages=1 | publisher=About Partners| language=English | accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref>.

==Government==
{{main|Government of Tulsa, Oklahoma}}

Tulsa has a [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council form of government]]. Tulsa is also the [[county seat]] for [[Tulsa County]].

==Cityscape==
[[Image:BostonAvenueMethodist.jpg|thumb|left|Located in Downtown, the [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]] is one of the city's most prominent examples of [[art deco]] architecture]]
{{main|Neighborhoods of Tulsa, Oklahoma}}
The city of Tulsa covers over 181 square miles--an area roughly three times the size of [[Washington DC]]. This large city footprint allows Tulsa's communities to take on a personality much their own. 

Downtown is known for its [[art deco]] architecture and, as expected, office buildings. In 1967, the current [[Bank of America]] building was completed and at 412 ft and 32 stories, became the tallest building in Tulsa. In 1973, the First Place building was built; it is 516 ft tall and 41 stories. At 667 ft and 52 stories, [[One Williams Center]] is the tallest building in any of the 5 "Plains States" ([[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]]).{{Fact|date=February 2007}} It was designed in 1975 by [[Minoru Yamasaki]] & Associates, the same architect who designed the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]]. [[CityPlex Towers]], in south Tulsa, were completed in 1981, with the largest of the three towers topping out at 60 stories and 648 ft tall. In 1984, the Mid Continent tower was completed and is 513 ft tall and 36 stories. Downtown contains Tulsa's largest entertainment and convention venues, including the [http://www.tulsapac.com/ Tulsa Performing Arts Center], another Yamasaki designed building.  Currently under construction is a multi-purpose 18,000-seat arena, the [[BOK Center]], designed by renowned architect [[Cesar Pelli]] (the designer of [[Petronas Towers]]).  Also located in downtown is the [http://www.bluedomeartsfestival.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?T0=4427&TM=14/ Blue Dome District] containing a number of popular restaurants and live music venues.  In 2006 it was announced that a  major redevelopment of the eastern perimeter of downtown is being planned. Called the "East End" the development is to include a new minor-league baseball stadium, shopping, dining and entertainment venues, and urban housing.

Uptown is the name given to a fairly small area immediately to the south of Downtown.  Referred to by residents as "Tulsa's Neighborhood with a River View" it is bounded by U.S. 51/75 to the North, the Arkansas River to the west, 21st Street to the south and South Cincinnati Avenue to the east.  Located on a bluff above the Arkansas River it primarily contains homes built in the early 20th Century as well as mid and high rise condominiums overlooking the river.  The historic Council Oak Park and larger Veterans Park are in the area, as well as the Boston District, a tightly packed collection of high-quality clubs and restaurants. 
[[Image:Tulsa.jpg|thumb|right|400px|View of Downtown Tulsa from the [[Arkansas River]]]]
North Tulsa is home to a large percentage of Tulsa's [[African-American]] community. The area's [[Booker T. Washington]] High School, one of Tulsa’s African-American high schools during the segregation era and now a [[magnet school]], was judged in 2005 to be the 58th best high school in the United States by [[Newsweek]] Magazine. Also included in this area is the Brady District, the [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood Historic District]] and the adjacent campus of [http://www.osu-tulsa.okstate.edu/ Oklahoma State University-Tulsa], the internationally famous [[Gilcrease Museum]], the Tulsa International Airport, the [[Tulsa Zoo]], the [[Tulsa Air and Space Museum]], and the nation's third-largest municipal park, Mohawk Park.  Many of the city's manufacturing and industrial areas are located in North Tulsa.

Midtown Tulsa is a largely residential district occupying land just south and east of Downtown and Uptown from the east bank of the Arkansas River to approximately Yale Avenue and 51st Street. This area, Tulsa's historical residential core, consists mostly of large upscale homes built in the early 1900s with architecture ranging from [[art deco]] to [[Greek Revival]].  This area also includes several neighborhoods of more modest but well-preserved [[American Craftsman]] and [[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudor]] style homes. This area is home to the [[Philbrook Museum]] and the [[University of Tulsa]], as well as Tulsa's premier upscale shopping district, [[Utica Square]], the historic Cherry Street district, Woodward Park, Swan Lake, the Municipal Rose Garden and Tulsa Garden Center, the St. John's and Hillcrest medical centers, the Brookside entertainment and dining district, Expo Square (home of the Tulsa [[State fair|State Fair]] and [[Tulsa Drillers]] baseball) and the Southroads and Promenade shopping centers. 

South Tulsa, a large area between 51st Street and 121st Street, was mostly undeveloped before the 1970s, but after 25 years of continuous construction booms it now contains Tulsa's largest shopping base (with a heavy concentration of chain retail stores particularly along 71st Street). The state's largest shopping mall (Woodland Hills), and some of the city's larger schools are located in the area. Portions of South Tulsa are particularly hilly and heavily wooded and many of the city's most expensive and secluded homes, including a number of [[gated communities]], are located in the area. South Tulsa also has the highest concentration of [[McMansion]] style homes in the Tulsa area. [[Southern Hills Country Club]], [[Oral Roberts University]], LaFortune Park, St. Francis Hospital and its attendant medical complexes, Southcrest Hospital, the Creek Nation Casino and most of the city's current river-side shopping and entertainment are located here. 

East Tulsa is an area comprised mostly of modest residential neighborhoods developed from the 1960s through the 1980s. Once predominantly populated by  white [[blue-collar]] workers, many employed at the large [[American Airlines]] maintenance facility near the Tulsa Airport to the north, the population has slowly changed to make East Tulsa one of Tulsa's most ethnically diverse areas.  Large numbers of [[Hispanic]] immigrants have established a vibrant community  centered around the Plaza Santa Cecelia near East 21st Street and Garnett Road.  A number of recent immigrants from [[Asia]] also inhabit the area.  Areas of light industry and manufacture are also found in East Tulsa and the Harvey Young Airport, a public commuter airport, is located on the eastern edge of the area.

West Tulsa, the entire city area west of the Arkansas River, has some of the city's largest parks and wilderness reserves. The area is also a testament to Tulsa's history in the oil industry, and still contains several large oil refineries.
 
Contributing to the Tulsa cityscape are also its main suburbs of [[Bixby, Oklahoma|Bixby]], [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma|Broken Arrow]], [[Catoosa, Oklahoma|Catoosa]], [[Coweta, Oklahoma|Coweta]], [[Glenpool, Oklahoma|Glenpool]], [[Jenks, Oklahoma|Jenks]], [[Kiefer, Oklahoma|Kiefer]], [[Owasso, Oklahoma|Owasso]], [[Sand Springs, Oklahoma|Sand Springs]], [[Sapulpa, Oklahoma|Sapulpa]], [[Skiatook, Oklahoma|Skiatook]] and [[Sperry, Oklahoma|Sperry]].

==Geography==
Tulsa, located in the northeastern corner of [[Oklahoma]], lies between the edge of the [[Great Plains]] and the foot of the [[Ozark Mountains]] in a generally forested region of rolling hills.

The city serves as the gateway to "[[Green Country]]," a popular and officially designated name for northeast Oklahoma.  The nickname is due to the region's dense green vegetation and relatively high amount of hills and lakes compared to that of Central and Western Oklahoma (which have geography similar to "[[Great Plains|the Great Plains]]" region of the U.S.). Northeastern Oklahoma contains more than half of the state's registered state parks and six of Oklahoma's 11 ecosystems, more than a dozen major reservoirs, as well as the state's most diversified agricultural economy and outdoor sports and recreation industry. <ref>[http://www.travelok.com/atv/index.asp#map] [Oklahoma Department of Tourism]</ref>

The city is split by the prominent [[Arkansas River]].  The Arkansas River flows in a wide, sandy-bottomed channel.  Its flow in the Tulsa area is controlled by upstream flood-control reservoirs and the width and depth of water in the channel can vary widely throughout the year. Except in the most severe drought (as experienced in 2006) a low-water dam maintains a full channel in the area adjacent to downtown Tulsa.  

Tulsa is heavily wooded, with abundant parks and water areas.  Several prominent hills with names such as "Shadow Mountain" and "Turkey Mountain" create varied terrain mostly in the southern portion of the city.  The central and northern sections are generally flat to gently undulating, although the Osage Hills extension into the northwestern part of the city further varies the landscape.

Tulsa's [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] are {{coor dms|36|7|53|N|95|56|14|W|city}} (36.131294, -95.937332){{GR|1}}, with an elevation of 213 m (700 ft) above [[sea level]].
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 483.9 [[km²]] (186.8 [[square mile|mi²]]). 473.1 km² (182.6 mi²) of it is land and 10.9 km² (4.2 mi²) of it (2.24%) is water.

[[Image:jenks_riverwalk.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"Riverwalk Crossing" in the suburb of [[Jenks]] is the first of many developments planned or under construction along the [[Arkansas River]] in the Tulsa area.]]

==Business and Economy==
For most of the 20th century, oil refinery and oil corporations dominated Tulsa's economy. Like the rest of Oklahoma, an oil bust in the 1980s severely compromised that economic foundation. Since then, city and county officials have been leading massive undertakings to diversify Tulsa's economy.

Today, Tulsa is still an important energy and oil center, but other industries have taken the spotlight, such as [[aerospace]], [[banking]], [[telecommunications]], [[high tech]], and [[insurance]].
[[Image:Tulsa_Arena.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Artist's rendering of new [[BOK Center]]]]
The city has the nation's most inland water port, the Tulsa Port of Catoosa [5], which connects the state with international ocean trade routes through the Arkansas River and Mississippi River. Tulsa is also home to a large American Airlines maintenance center.

In 2006, Tulsa was said to be "the sweetest place per capita".

[http://www.vision2025.info/ Vision 2025], a comprehensive economic and tourism development initiative, was city leaders' response to an economic downturn during a national recession in the early 2000s.
The initiative promised to recreate recently lost jobs and rapidly increase job development over the next decade. The crown jewel of Vision 2025 projects, the [[BOK Center]], the 18,000-seat arena currently under construction in downtown Tulsa, was designed to be an architectural icon of the city. Leaders hope the arena will spur downtown development.

In 2006, Forbes magazine rated Tulsa as second in the nation in job income growth, and one of the best 50 cities to do business in the country. <ref name="forbestop50">{{cite web | date=2006 | url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/1/2813.html | title= Tulsa, OK: Best Places to do Business 2006 | format=web | work=Forbes Magazine| pages=1 | publisher= Forbes Magazine| language=English | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref> 2006 also found Tulsa in the midst of a significant economic development and investment surge. <ref name="Globe Street Retail">{{cite web | date=June 11 2006 | url=http://www.globest.com/retail/news/midwest/20483-1.html | title= Cap Rates Turning More Investors Onto Tulsa | format=web news article | work=Globeest.com | pages=1 | publisher= Globest.com| language=English | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref>

=== Museums and cultural centers ===
[[Image:The Philbrook Museum of Art and formal gardens.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The Philbrook Museum of Art]]
Tulsa’s culture is apparent in the city’s most prominent art museums, the [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] and [[Gilcrease Museum]]. 
[http://www.philbrook.org/ The Philbrook] is located in the former estate of [[petroleum|oil]] pioneer [[Waite Phillips]]. Phillips and his wife, Genevieve, donated the 1927 [[Italian Renaissance]] "Villa Philbrook" and its 23 acres of landscaped grounds to the city of Tulsa in 1938. Considered one of the top 50 art museums in the U.S., it is one of only five to offer a combination of historic home, gardens, and art collection.  The expansive grounds contain elaborate gardens inspired by [[Villa Lante]], an Italian country estate north of Rome designed by [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] in 1566.

[http://www.gilcrease.org/ Gilcrease Museum] houses the world's largest, most comprehensive collection of art and artifacts of the American West. The Museum also offers an unparalleled collection of Native American art and artifacts, as well as historical manuscripts, documents and maps. Themed gardens, focused on various periods of North American history, have been developed on 23 of the museum's 460 acres. The museum is located on the former estate of [[Thomas Gilcrease]], a prominent early Tulsa oilman, in the Osage Hills northwest of downtown Tulsa. His restored home is located on the grounds.  Gilcrease's bequeth of his large collection of American art and artifacts to the city of Tulsa in 1955 formed the foundation of the Muesum's collections.

===Amusement Parks===
Tulsa currently has one main amusement park attraction.

[http://www.bellsfamilyfun.com/ Bell's Amusement Park], a [[Coney Island]]-style amusement park, featured Oklahoma’s largest wooden Roller Coaster. The park also featured an antique ferris wheel until it was severely damaged beyond repair in a storm in the summer of 2006. However, Bell's does still have one of the tallest [[Drop tower (amusement ride)|drop-towers]] in the southwest.  Bell's was located at Expo Square and its rides are incorporated into the midway during the annual Tulsa State Fair. Bell's Amusment Park was closed down in 2006 after county officials decided not to renew the park's lease agreement. The owner of Bell's is looking to relocate from the old Expo Square location, and is currently taking bids from other cities in the Tulsa metropolitan area.

[[Big Splash Water Park]] [http://www.bigsplashwaterpark.com], also located at Expo Square, features several multi-story water-slides and a large wave pool.

[[Southern Hills Country Club]] (SHCC) is one of the top rated golf courses in the nation and one of a very few to host six majors: 3 [[PGA Championship]]s and 3 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]s, the most recent in 2001. It will host its 4th PGA Championship and seventh major overall in 2007. SHCC has also hosted five amateur championships.  Additionally, Tulsa hosts the [[John Q. Hammons Hotel Classic]], a regular [[LPGA]] tour stop, at the Cedar Ridge Country Club.  

Tulsa has 2 universities that compete in sports at the [[NCAA]] [[Division I]] level: the [[University of Tulsa]] and [[Oral Roberts University]].  The Tulsa area is also home to several high school athletic teams that are frequently ranked among the best nationally.

Along with [[Oklahoma City]] and several other U.S. and Canadian sites, Tulsa has been mentioned as a possible home for the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] should the NHL club opt to leave Pittsburgh. [http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/sports/story.html?id=c65602c7-41a0-42a4-9530-3e788e983888&k=66824]  Although Tulsa is scheduled to open a new indoor arena in [[2008]], a [[major sports]] franchise is considered a long-shot since the metro area is still under one million people.

===Gaming===
Tulsa has several Indian gaming venues. As a result of [[treaty|compacts]] between the State and various Native American tribes, tribal gaming facilities that were previously limited to bingo now offer table card games and slot machines. 
[http://www.cherokeecasino.com/ Cherokee Casino and Resort],
[http://www.creeknationcasino.com/ Creek Nation Casino], and Osage Million Dollar Elm (two locations), are the largest casinos in the Tulsa Metro area. [[Horse racing]] is also a popular gambling draw, both at [http://www.fairmeadows.com/ Fair Meadows] race track, and at Will Rogers Downs in nearby [[Claremore]]. Fair Meadows also has a large Off-Track betting center.

==Healthcare System==

Healthcare in Tulsa is primarily serviced by six private hospitals, the Catholic-affiliated [http://www.sjmc.com/ St. John] and [http://www.saintfrancis.com/ St. Francis] systems, the Ardent-affiliated [[Hillcrest Healthcare System|Hillcrest Hospital]] and [http://www.tulsaregional.com/ OSU Medical Center], Triad's [[Triad Hospitals|SouthCrest]][http://www.southcresthospital.com] and [[Cancer Treatment Centers of America]] [http://www.cancercenter.com/southwestern-hospital.cfm Southwestern Medical Center].

[[Tulsa County]] operates the [http://www.tulsa-health.org/ Tulsa Health Department].

==Climate==
Tulsa  has a [[temperate]] climate of the [[Continental climate|continental]] variety. As is typical for the temperate zone, Tulsa's climate varies throughout the seasons and experiences occasional extremes.

Year-round average temperature of 61°F.

[[Summer]] temperatures of 40 °C (100 °F) or higher are often observed from July to early September. These are usually accompanied by high humidity, caused by warm air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] brought in by southerly winds. Between May and September, Tulsa also experiences an "[[Ozone]] Season", caused by a combination of factors including climate and [[hydrocarbon]] emissions. During this season, Tulsa frequently issues "Ozone Alerts [http://www.ozonealert.com]", encouraging all parties to do their part in complying with the [[Clean Air Act]] and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|E.P.A.]] standards.

[[Winter]] temperatures, while generally mild, also occasionally experience extremes below -20 °C (0 °F).

The [[Autumn|fall]] season is quite short, consisting of a brief period of pleasant, sunny days and cool nights.

Primarily during the [[Spring (season)|spring]] and early [[summer]] months, the Tulsa area is often subjected to severe [[thunderstorms]], some of which contain large [[hail]], damaging winds and, not infrequently, [[tornadoes]]. Severe weather is not limited, though, to this season. On December 5 1975, for example, Tulsa experienced a damaging tornado.

The spring and early summer [[thunderstorm]] pattern also provides the area with a disproportionate share of its annual [[rainfall]], which averages around 100 cm (39 inches). Due to frequent [[flood|flooding]] in past decades, Tulsa now has one of the most extensive flood control systems in the nation. In 2000, [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] honored Tulsa as leading the nation in flood plain management.<ref>[[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] News Release HQ-00-046a, 13-Sep-2000 [http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=8679]</ref>

==Tulsa Metro Area==

The Tulsa [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) consists of seven counties in northeastern [[Oklahoma]]: [[Tulsa County, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Rogers County, Oklahoma|Rogers]], [[Osage County, Oklahoma|Osage]], [[Wagoner County, Oklahoma|Wagoner]], [[Okmulgee County, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]], [[Pawnee County, Oklahoma|Pawnee]], and [[Creek County, Oklahoma|Creek]]. The 2005 US Census Estimate shows the Tulsa MSA to have 887,715 residents.

The Tulsa-Bartlesville [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA),  is created by adding the [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] micropolitan area which consists of [[Washington County, Oklahoma|Washington County]] in Northeastern Oklahoma.

The 2006 US Census Estimate shows the Tulsa-Bartlesville CMSA to have 936,864 residents. Cities and towns in this area include (in no particular order):

*'''North:''' [[Dewey, Oklahoma|Dewey]], [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma|Bartlesville]], [[Pawhuska, Oklahoma|Pawhuska]], [[Barnsdall, Oklahoma|Barnsdall]], [[Skiatook, Oklahoma|Skiatook]], [[Collinsville, Oklahoma|Collinsville]], [[Owasso, Oklahoma|Owasso]], [[Nowata, Oklahoma|Nowata]]

*'''South:''' [[Jenks, Oklahoma|Jenks]], [[Glenpool, Oklahoma|Glenpool]], [[Bixby, Oklahoma|Bixby]], [[Mounds, Oklahoma|Mounds]], [[Beggs, Oklahoma|Beggs]], [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]], [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]]

'''Green Country'''

[[Green Country]] is a popular term used in different scenarios to describe different aspects of the Greater Tulsa Region, but may also refer specifically to the official Tulsa MSA. Each usage of the term is derived from its official meaning as the tourism designation for all of Northeastern Oklahoma.

While the Tulsa MSA only officially occupies a section of [[Green Country]] as it is defined by the [[Oklahoma Department of Transportation]], the entire region is sometimes referred to as the Greater Tulsa Area. On the same accord, the term "[[Green Country]]" can apply to the immediate Tulsa urban area or the city of Tulsa proper, but neither of these are proper or official for the use of the term. (''See "[[Green Country]]"'')

==Transportation==
'''Air'''

Tulsa is served by [[Tulsa International Airport]] (TUL) to the north and Richard L. Jones, Jr. Airport (RVS) to the south. TUL is home to eleven commercial airlines, seven cargo carriers, and several charter airlines which serve nearly 3 million travelers annually with almost 80 departures every day.  The airport has completed most of its expansion project, and has recently added several restaurants and shops as well as "expanded seating areas, convenient restrooms, and real time flight information."  The impact of airport operations on the surrounding community is nearly $3.2 billion annually. <ref>Tulsa International Airport website, available http://www.tulsaairports.com/</ref>

RVS, also known as Riverside airport, is located in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].  The airport saw 285,484 takeoffs and landings in 2004, making it the busiest airport in the state of Oklahoma.  Much of this traffic is from the six flights schools which operate over 500 aircraft out of the airport (establishing it as one of the busiest flight training facilities in the country).  RVS operations generate over $3.2 million annually.<ref>Richard L. Jones, Jr. Airport website, available http://www.tulsaairports.com/rljones/rljones_airport.html</ref>

'''Land'''

Important highways passing through Tulsa are:
*[[Interstate 44]] - Skelly Drive / Skelly Bypass (bypasses downtown to the South)
*[[Interstate 244]] - Martin Luther King Expressway - known by locals as Red Fork Expressway west of downtown and Crosstown Expressway east of downtown (serves downtown, loops back to I-44 at either terminal)
*[[Interstate 444]] - unsigned Interstate, but forms with I-244 the IDL (Inner Dispersal Loop) which surrounds downtown
*[[U.S. Route 412]]
*[[U.S. Route 64]] - Broken Arrow Expressway to the east as far as Memorial Drive, Keystone Expressway to the west; at the Memorial Drive exit, U.S. 64 follows Memorial Drive southward to the Tulsa suburb of Bixby, Oklahoma
*[[U.S. Route 75]] - Okmulgee Beeline to the south, where it becomes the Indian Nations Turnpike, Cherokee Expressway to the north
*[[U.S. Route 169]] - Mingo Valley Expressway (also called Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway) bypassing downtown to the east, serving the airport, and wrapping around far South Tulsa before turning into the Creek Turnpike
*[[State Highway 11 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 11]] - Gilcrease Drive (serves Tulsa Airport)
*[[State Highway 51 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 51]] - alternate designation for Broken Arrow Expressway
*[[Creek Turnpike]] - U.S. 169 turns to the west from its north-south axis and becomes the Creek Turnpike, allowing drivers to completely bypass the city on the east and south sides

It was also served by historic [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]], and there are numerous reminders of this by the mid-20th century era, especially [[motels]] and [[restaurants]] along 11th Street and Admiral Place. [[Cyrus Avery]], known as "The Father of Route 66," resided in Tulsa.

'''Water'''

East of Tulsa, in [[Catoosa, Oklahoma|Catoosa]], the [[Tulsa Port of Catoosa]] is the head of navigation for the McClellan-Kerr [[Arkansas River]] Navigation System (MKARNS), connecting [[barge]] traffic from Tulsa to the [[Mississippi River]].  This port is the farthest inland port in the United States.

'''Public Transportation'''

Citywide bus transit is provided by the [http://www.tulsatransit.org/ Metropolitan Tulsa Transit Authority].

'''Street Network'''

Tulsa follows a systematic naming and numbering convention for all [[streets]] falling within its municipal jurisdiction. Admiral Place is the east-west-running dividing line for "streets north" and "streets south", while [[Main Street]] is the north-south-running dividing line for "west avenues" and "east avenues." 

Avenues falling west of Main Street are named for US cities west of the [[Mississippi River]] for one run of the alphabet, after which numbered "west avenues" are assigned. Avenues falling east of Main Street are named for US cities east of the [[Mississippi River]] for approximately three runs of the alphabet, after which numbered "east avenues" are assigned. 

Streets falling north of Admiral Place are labeled for important names in Tulsa's history for one run of the alphabet, after which numbered "streets north" are assigned. Streets falling south of Admiral Place are numbered, beginning with "1st Street" and continuing southward. Street names and numbers are consistent throughout the Tulsa jurisdiction, regardless if a particular street is contiguous/continuous. 

Addresses reflect their associated hundred [[block]] from either Admiral or Main. There are usually 16 blocks per mile as counted by avenues, and there are 10 blocks per mile as counted by streets. Other right-of-way labels (such as Place, Court, Drive, Terrace, etc.) may be used to describe an intermittent [[street]] or [[avenue]], but the actual name will usually be the same as the adjacent street or avenue (such as Knoxville Avenue and its neighboring Knoxville Place, both assigned as the 3600 [[block]] east). 

Major arterial streets can be found at every mile, as assigned by the [[survey township|township-and-range]] system, resulting in a well-defined grid of thoroughfares across the Tulsa region.  As an example, east-west-running thoroughfares south of Admiral Place are streets ending with a ''1'', including 11th Street, 21st Street, 31st Street, etc.
