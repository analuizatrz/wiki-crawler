On 1 May 1707, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom of Great Britain]],<ref>[http://www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk/union.html THE TREATY or Act of the Union] www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk, accessed 27 August 2008</ref> usually referred to thereafter as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], was created by the [[political union]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] (which included the once independent [[Principality of Wales]]) and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. This event was the result of the [[Treaty of Union]] that was agreed on 22 July 1706,<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/images/historical/1707union.cfm Articles of Union with Scotland 1707] www.parliament.uk </ref> and then ratified by the Parliaments of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] each passing an [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] in 1707. Almost a century later, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been brought under English control between 1541 and [[Treaty of Limerick|1691]], joined the Kingdom of Great Britain with the passing of the [[Act of Union 1800]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#act | title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> Although England and Scotland had been separate countries prior to 1707, they had been in [[personal union]] since 1603, when [[James I of England|James VI King of Scots]] had inherited the throne of the Kingdom of England, becoming King James I of England, and left [[Edinburgh]] for [[London]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Chronology of Scottish History|publisher=Geddes & Grosset|isbn=1-85534-380-0|last=Ross|first=David|date=2002|quote='''1603:''' James VI becomes [[James I of England]] in the [[Union of the Crowns]], and leaves [[Edinburgh]] for [[London]]|page=56}}</ref> 

[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|left|The [[British Empire]] in 1897. By 1920 it had become the [[list of largest empires|largest empire in history]]]]

In its first century, the United Kingdom played an important role in developing [[Western world|Western]] ideas of the [[parliamentary system]] as well as making significant contributions to literature, the arts and science.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |authorlink=Niall Ferguson |year=2003 |title=Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order |publisher=Basic Books |id=ISBN 0-465-02328-2}}</ref> The UK-led [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed the country and fuelled the [[British Empire]]. During this time, like other [[great power]]s, the UK was involved in [[Colonialism|colonial]] exploitation, including the [[Atlantic slave trade]], although the passing of the 1807 [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] made the UK the first country to prohibit trade in slaves.

After the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the UK emerged the principal naval power of the 19th century. The United Kingdom remained an eminent power into the mid-20th century, and its empire expanded to its maximum size by 1921, gaining the [[League of Nations]] mandate over former German and Ottoman colonies after [[World War I]].

Long simmering tensions in Ireland led to the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|partition]] of the island in 1920, followed by independence for the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. Six of the nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] of the province of [[Ulster]] remained within the UK. In 1927, the formal name of the UK changed to its current name, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, by way of the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]].<ref name="CAIN">{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm |title=The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921 |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref>

[[Image:Supermarinespitfire.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Britain]]. The United Kingdom was the only [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Europe]]an country to remain free from occupation during [[World War II]].]]

After World War I, the world's first large-scale international broadcasting network, the [[BBC]], was created. Britain was one of the major Allied powers in [[World War II]], and wartime leader [[Winston Churchill]] and his peacetime successor [[Clement Attlee]] helped plan the post-war world as part of the "Big Three". World War II left the United Kingdom financially damaged. Loans taken out during and after World War II from both Canada and the United States were economically costly but, along with post-war [[Marshall Plan|Marshall aid]], the UK began the road to recovery.

The immediate post-war years saw the establishment of the British [[Welfare State]], including one of the world's first and most comprehensive public [[National Health Service|health services]], while the demands of a recovering economy brought people from all over the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] to create a [[Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)|multiethnic Britain]]. Although the new post-war limits of Britain's [[politics|political]] role were confirmed by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the international spread of the [[English language]] meant the continuing impact of its literature and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|culture]], while at the same time from the 1960s its [[popular culture]] found influence abroad. Following a period of global economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the 1980s saw the inflow of substantial [[North Sea oil|oil revenues]] and economic growth. The premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] marked a significant change of direction from the post-war political and economic consensus; a path that was continued by the [[Labour Party (UK)#New Labour|New Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]] in 1997.

The United Kingdom was one of the 12 founding members of the [[European Union]] at its launch in 1992 with the signing of the [[Maastricht Treaty]].  Prior to that, it had been a member of the EU's forerunner, the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), from 1973. The attitude of the present [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government towards further integration with this organisation is mixed,<ref name=Times>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-1948441,00.html |title=Modest progress but always on back foot |publisher=Times Online |date=2005-12-21 |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> with the [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|Offical Opposition]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], favouring a return of some powers and competencies to the state.<ref name=Conservatives>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=europe.news.campaigns.display.page&obj_id=73417 |title=European Constitution: bad for Britain, bad for Europe |publisher=Conservative Party |accessdate=2006-05-23}}</ref>

The end of the 20th century saw a major change to the governance of the UK with the creation of a [[devolution|devolved]] [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]] following popular approval in pre-legislative [[Referendums in the United Kingdom|referenda]]. This produced the prospect of a legislative path to [[Scottish independence|independence for Scotland]] when the [[Scottish National Party]] won the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 election]] and formed a [[minority government]] in Scotland, with a mandate to hold a referendum by 2011 on whether it should negotiate for Scottish independence.

{{Main|Politics of the United Kingdom|Monarchy of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM Queen Elizabeth II]]]]

The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as head of state; the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch of the UK]] also serves as head of state of [[Commonwealth realm|fifteen other Commonwealth countries]], putting the UK in a [[personal union]] with those other states. The Crown has sovereignty over the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]]. Collectively, these three territories are known as the [[Crown Dependencies]], lands owned by the British monarch but not part of the United Kingdom. They are not part of the [[European Union]]. However, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has the authority to legislate for the dependencies, and the British government manages their foreign affairs and defence.

The UK has fourteen [[British overseas territories|overseas territories]] around the world, the last remaining territories of the [[British Empire]]. The overseas territories are not considered part of the UK, but in most cases the local populations have British citizenship and the right of abode in the UK. This has been the case since 2002.

The UK has a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary government]] based on strong traditions: the [[Westminster system]] has been emulated around the world â a legacy of the [[British Empire]].

[[Image:Location of the BOTs.png|thumb|right|The UK's remaining overseas territories]]

[[Constitution of the United Kingdom|The UK's constitution]] governs the legal framework of the country and consists mostly of written sources, including [[statute]]s, judge made [[case law]], and international treaties. As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and [[law]] considered to be "constitutional law," the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] can perform "constitutional reform" simply by passing [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] and thus has the [[political power|power]] to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/sovereignty.cfm|title=Official UK Parliament web page on parliamentary sovereignty}}</ref> The United Kingdom is one of the three countries in the world today that does not have a codified [[constitution]] (the other two being [[New Zealand]] and [[Israel]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm#UK%20Legal%20System |title=A Guide To the UK Legal System |author=Sarah Carter |publisher=[[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

The position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the UK's [[head of government]], belongs to the Member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], usually the current leader of the largest political party in that chamber. The Prime Minister and Cabinet are formally appointed by the Monarch to form [[Her Majesty's Government]]. Though the Prime Minister chooses the Cabinet, and by convention HM The Queen respects the Prime Minister's choices. The [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons, to which [[Responsible government|they are responsible]]. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all of whom are sworn into [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]], and become [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]]. ''The Rt Hon'' [[Gordon Brown]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], has been Prime Minister, [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]] since 27 June 2007.<ref name="npm">{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245682.stm | title= Brown is UK's new prime minister | date=2007-06-27 | accessdate= 2008-01-23 | work= BBC News | publisher= [[BBC News|news.bbc.co.uk]] }}</ref>

[[Image:Westminster palace.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]]]

The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that meets in the [[Palace of Westminster]] is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom. It has two houses: an elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and an appointed [[House of Lords]], and any Bill passed requires the [[Royal Assent|assent]] of HM The Queen to become law. A devolved parliament in [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]] and devolved assemblies in [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], and [[National Assembly for Wales|Wales]] were established following public approval as expressed in [[Referendum|referenda]], but these are not sovereign bodies and could be abolished by the UK parliament.

For elections to the House of Commons, the UK is currently divided into [[United Kingdom constituencies|646 constituencies]], with 529 in England, 18 in Northern Ireland, [[Scottish Westminster constituencies from 2005|59 in Scotland]] and 40 in Wales, though this number will rise to 650 at the [[Next United Kingdom general election|next General Election]]. Each constituency elects one Member of Parliament by [[Plurality voting system|simple plurality]]. General Elections are called by the Monarch when the Prime Minister so advises. Though there is no minimum term for a Parliament, a new election must be called within five years of the previous general election.

For elections to the [[European Parliament]], the UK has 78 MEPs, elected in 12 [[Voting system#Multiple-winner methods|multi-member]] constituencies. Questions over sovereignty have been brought forward due to the UK's membership of the [[European Union]].<ref name=Times20050914>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1779849,00.htm |title=Europe Wins The Power To Jail British Citizens |publisher=The Times |date=2005-09-14}}</ref>

The UK's three [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom#Major political parties in the United Kingdom|major political parties]] are the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and the [[Liberal Democrats]], winning between them 616 out of the 646 seats available in the House of Commons at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]].

In accordance with party policy, no elected Sinn FÃ©in Member of Parliament has ever attended the House of Commons to speak in the House on behalf of their constituents as Members of Parliament are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Monarch. However, the current five [[Sinn FÃ©in]] MPs have since 2002 made use of the offices and other facilities available at Westminster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1771635.stm|title=news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1771635.stm<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

=== Devolved national administrations ===

[[Image:Stormont Parliamentary Building 01.JPG|thumb|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] in [[Stormont, Belfast|Stormont]], [[Belfast]], seat of the assembly.]]

[[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] each has a [[Devolution|devolved]], [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature and its own [[Executive (government)|government or Executive]], led by a [[First Minister]]. England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament on all issues. This situation has given rise to the so-called [[West Lothian question]] which concerns the fact that MPs from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales vote on matters affecting England that are handled by devolved legislatures for their own constituencies. 

The [[Scottish Parliament]] has wide ranging legislative powers over any matter that has not been specifically '[[reserved matters|reserved]]' to the UK parliament, including [[education in Scotland|education]], [[NHS Scotland|healthcare]], [[Scots law]] and [[local government in Scotland|local government]]. Following their victory at the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 elections]], the [[Scottish independence|pro-independence]] [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] formed a minority [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|government]] with its leader, [[Alex Salmond]], becoming [[First Minister of Scotland]]. The pro-union parties responded to the electoral success of the SNP by creating a [[Scottish Constitutional Commission|Commission]] to examine the case for devolving additional powers while excluding [[Scottish independence]] as an option,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7311840.stm |title=Devolution review body launched |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-03-25}}</ref> though the then leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Wendy Alexander, indicated that Labour would support calls for independence to be placed before the people in a referendum in the hope that a vote to reject independence would settle the constitutional debate for a generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Wendy-39Bring-it-on39.4049804.jp |title=Wendy: 'Bring it on' |publisher=[[Scotsman]] |date=2008-05-05}}</ref> Most opinion polls do show minority support for independence though support varies depending on the nature of the question.  However, a poll in April 2008 that used the proposed referendum wording found support for independence had reached 41% with just 40% supporting retention of the Union.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2192965.0.0.php |title=41% of Scots back the break-up of the union |publisher=Sunday Herald |date=2008-04-13}}</ref>

The powers devolved to the [[National Assembly for Wales]] are more limited than those devolved to Scotland,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/wales_99/the_welsh_assembly/309033.stm |title=Structure and powers of the Assembly |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-04-09}}</ref> although following the passing of the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]], the Assembly can now legislate in some areas through [[Legislative Competency Order]]s which can be granted on a case by case basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/jul/16/wales.devolution |title=What powers does the Welsh Assembly have? |publisher=Guardian |date=2007-07-16}}</ref> The current [[Welsh Assembly Government]] was formed several weeks after the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2007|2007 elections]], following a brief period of minority administration, when [[Plaid Cymru]] joined [[Wales Labour Party|Labour]] in a coalition [[Government of the 3rd National Assembly for Wales|government]] under the continuing leadership of First Minister [[Rhodri Morgan]].

The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has powers closer to those already devolved to Scotland. The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] is currently led by First Minister [[Peter Robinson (politician)|Peter Robinson]] ([[Democratic Unionist Party]]) and deputy First Minister [[Martin McGuinness]] ([[Sinn FÃ©in]]).<ref>http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/your-government/devolved-government.htm Northern Ireland Executive</ref>

[[Image:ManchesterTownHall OwlofDoom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manchester Town Hall]] houses the [[Manchester City Council]].]]

The [[history of local government in the United Kingdom|history of local government]] in all parts of the United Kingdom is marked by little change in the arrangements that preceded the Union until the 19th century after which there has been a constant evolution of role and function.<ref name=barlow>Barlow, I., ''Metropolitan Government'', (1991)</ref> Change did not occur in the different countries of the United Kingdom in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are unlikely to be uniform either.

The organisation of [[local government in England]] is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to the local arrangements. Legislation concerning local government in [[England]] is decided by the UK parliament and the [[Her Majesty's Government|government of the United Kingdom]], because England does not have a devolved parliament. The upper-tier [[subdivisions of England]] are the nine [[Regions of England|Government office regions]] or European Union government office regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gos.gov.uk/national/|publisher=gos.gov.uk|date=|accessdate=2008-07-31|title=Welcome to the national site of the Government Office Network}}</ref> A [[Greater London Authority referendum, 1998|London referendum]] in 1998 on the question of having a directly elected assembly and directly elected mayor produced a large majority in favour and it was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]]. However, a rejection by a [[Northern England devolution referendums, 2004|referendum in 2004]] of a proposed assembly in the [[North East England|North East]] region stopped this idea in its tracks.<ref>"The Government is now expected to tear up its twelve-year-old plan to create eight or nine regional assemblies in England to mirror devolution in Scotland and Wales."{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article503255.ece|title=Prescott's dream in tatters as North East rejects assembly|accessdate=2008-02-15|work=The Times}}</ref> Below the region level, [[London]] consists of 32 [[London borough]]s and the rest of England has either [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|county council]]s and district councils or [[unitary authorities]].

[[Local government in Northern Ireland]] is organised into 26 districts. The district councils do not carry out the same range of functions as would be the case in the rest of the United Kingdom with powers limited to services like collecting waste, controlling dogs, and maintaining parks and cemeteries.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4449092.stm NI local government set for shake-up]BBC News, 18 November 2005 </ref> However, on 13 March 2008, the Executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils to replace the present system<ref>[http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-doe/news-doe-130308-foster-announces-the.htm ''Foster announces the future shape of local government'', NI Executive]</ref> and the next local elections will be postponed until 2011 to facilitate this.<ref>[http://www.nio.gov.uk/local-government-elections-to-be-aligned-with-review-of-public-administration/media-detail.htm?newsID=15153 Local Government elections to be aligned with review of public administration] www.nio.gov.uk, accessed, 2 August 2008 </ref>

[[Local government in Scotland]] is divided on a basis of [[subdivisions of Scotland|32 council areas]] with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] are separate council areas as also is [[Politics of the Highland council area|Highland Council]] which includes a third of Scotland's area but just over 200,000&nbsp;people. The power invested in local authorities is administered by elected councillors, of which there are currently 1,222<ref>[http://www.psa.ac.uk/2007/pps/Bennie.pdf STV in Scotland:Local Government Elections 2007] Political Studies Association, accessed 2 August 2008</ref> who are each paid a part-time salary. Elections are conducted by [[single transferable vote]] in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] or [[Chair (official)|Convenor]] to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area.  The representative association of Scotland's local authorities is the [[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities]] (COSLA).

[[Local government in Wales]] consists of 22 unitary authorities, including the cities of [[Cardiff]], [[Swansea]] and [[Newport]], which are separate unitary authorities in their own right.<ref>[http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/localgovernment/localauthorities/?lang=en Local Authorities] new.wales.gov.uk, accessed 31 July 2008</ref>

== Law and criminal justice ==
{{main|Law of the United Kingdom}}

The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system due to it being created by the political union of previously independent countries with Article 19 of the [[Treaty of Union]] guaranteeing the continued existence of Scotland's separate legal system.  Today the UK has three distinct [[Legal systems of the world|systems of law]]: [[English law]], [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law]] and [[Scots law]]. Recent constitutional changes will see a new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] come into being in October 2009 that will take on the appeal functions of the Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom]|252&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 258317 bytes -->}}, Department for Constitutional Affairs. Retrieved on [[2006-05-22]]</ref> The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], comprising the same members as the Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]], is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the UK overseas territories, and the British crown dependencies.

=== England, Wales and Northern Ireland ===
{{main|English law|Northern Ireland law}}
[[Image:Royal courts of justice.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Royal Courts of Justice]].]]
Both [[English law]], which applies in [[England and Wales]], and [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law]] are based on [[common law|common-law]] principles. The essence of common-law is that law is made by [[judge]]s sitting in [[court]]s, applying their common sense and knowledge of [[precedent]] (''[[stare decisis]]'') to the facts before them. The [[Courts of England and Wales]] are headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] (for civil cases) and the [[Crown Court]] (for criminal cases). The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") is presently the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil cases in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]] and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the hierarchy.

Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995 though, since that peak, there has been an overall fall of 48% in crime from 1995 to 2007/8.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7511192.stm |title=Police-recorded crime down by 9% |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-17}}</ref> Despite the fall in crime rates, the [[prison population of England and Wales]] has almost doubled over the same period, to over 80,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7235438.stm New record high prison population] BBC News, 8 February 2008 </ref> [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]], which reports  to the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], manages most of the [[prison]]s within England and Wales.

=== Scotland ===
{{main|Scots law}}
[[Scots law]], a hybrid system based on both common-law and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] principles, applies in [[Scotland]].  The chief courts are the [[Court of Session]], for civil cases, and the [[High Court of Justiciary]], for criminal cases. The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to as "The House of Lords") presently serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law but only if the Court of Session grants leave to appeal or the initial judgement was by a majority decision. [[Sheriff Court]]s deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal [[trial (law)|trials]] with a jury, known as Sheriff solemn Court, or with a Sheriff and no jury, known as (Sheriff summary Court). The [[Sheriff Court]]s provide a local court service with 49 Sheriff courts organised across six [[Sheriffdom]]s.

The Scots legal system is unique in having three possible [[verdict]]s for a criminal trial: "[[guilt (law)|guilt]]y", "[[acquittal|not guilty]]" and "''[[not proven]]''". Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an [[acquittal]] with no possibility of [[new trial|retrial]]. The [[Scottish Prison Service]] (SPS) manages the prisons in Scotland which contain between them approximately 8,000 prisoners.<ref>[http://www.sps.gov.uk/default.aspx?documentid=7811a7f1-6c61-4667-a12c-f102bbf5b808 Prisoner Population at Friday 22 August 2008]www.sps.gov.uk, accessed August 28, 2008</ref> The [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]] is responsible for the Scottish Prison Service within the Scottish Government.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the United Kingdom|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:uk topo en.jpg|thumb|UK's topography]]
The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately {{convert|245000|km2|sqmi|-1}} comprising of the island of Great Britain, the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland) and smaller islands.  It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, coming within {{convert|35|km|mi|0}} of the northwest coast of France, from which it is separated by the [[English Channel]]. Great Britain lies between latitudes 49Â° and 59Â° N (the Shetland Islands reach to nearly 61Â° N), and longitudes 8Â° W to 2Â° E. The Royal Greenwich Observatory, near London, is the defining point of the [[Prime Meridian]]. When measured directly north-south, Great Britain is a little over {{convert|1100|km|mi|-2}} in length and is a fraction under {{convert|500|km|mi|-2}} at its widest, but the greatest distance between two points is {{convert|1350|km|mi|-1}} between [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]] (near [[Penzance]]) and [[John o' Groats]] in [[Caithness]] (near [[Thurso]]). Northern Ireland shares a {{convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on}} land boundary with [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. 

The United Kingdom has a temperate [[climate]], with plentiful rainfall all year round. The temperature varies with the seasons but seldom drops below {{convert|-10|C|lk=on}} or rises above {{convert|35|C}}. The prevailing wind is from the southwest, bearing frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean. Eastern parts are most sheltered from this wind and are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]], bring mild winters, especially in the west, where winters are wet, especially over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north. Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, though it rarely settles to great depth away from high ground.

[[Geography of England|England]] accounts for just over half of the total area of the UK, covering {{convert|130410|km2|sqmi|-1}}. Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, and mountainous terrain north-west of the [[Tees-Exe line]]. Mountain chains are found in the north-west ([[Lake District|Cumbrian Mountains]] of the Lake District), north (the upland moors of the [[Pennines]] and [[limestone]] hills of the [[Peak District]]) and south-west ([[Exmoor]] and [[Dartmoor]]).  Lower ranges include the [[limestone]] hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Cotswolds]] and [[Lincolnshire Wolds]], and the [[chalk]] downs of the [[Southern England Chalk Formation]]. The main rivers and estuaries are the [[River Thames|Thames]], [[River Severn|Severn]] and the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. England's highest mountain is [[Scafell Pike]], which is in the [[Lake District]] {{convert|978|m|ft|0}}. England has a number of large towns and cities and, in terms of [[Larger Urban Zones]], has six of the top 50 Zones in the European Union.

[[Image:BenNevis2005.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Nevis]], in Scotland's [[Grampian Mountains]], is the highest point in the [[British Isles]]]]

[[Geography of Scotland|Scotland]] accounts for about a third of the total area of the UK, covering {{convert|78772|km2|sqmi|-1}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/about/fact-file/index.html |title=Scotland Facts |publisher=www.scotland.org |accessedate=2008-07-16}}</ref> The topography of Scotland is distinguished by the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]{{ndash}} a [[Fault (geology)|geological rock fracture]]{{ndash}} which traverses the Scottish mainland from [[Helensburgh]] to [[Stonehaven]]. The faultline separates two distinctively different regions; namely the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to the north and west and the [[Scottish Lowlands|lowlands]] to the south and east. The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland's mountainous terrain, including the highest peak, [[Ben Nevis]], at {{convert|1344|m|ft|0}}. Lowland areas, in the southern part of Scotland, are flatter and home to most of the population, especially the narrow waist of land between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and the [[Firth of Forth]] known as the [[Central Lowlands|Central Belt]]. [[Glasgow]] is the largest city in Scotland, although [[Edinburgh]] is the [[capital]] and political centre of the country. Scotland also has nearly eight hundred [[List of islands of Scotland|islands]], mainly west and north of the mainland, notably the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland|Shetland Islands]].

[[Geography of Wales|Wales]] accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the UK, covering just {{convert|20758|km2|sqmi|-1}}. Wales is mostly mountainous though [[South Wales]] is less mountainous than North and Mid Wales. The main population and industrial areas are in [[South Wales]], consisting of the cities of [[Cardiff]], [[Swansea]] and [[Newport]] and surrounding [[South Wales Valleys]].  The highest mountains in Wales are in [[Snowdonia]], and include [[Snowdon]] (''Yr Wyddfa'' in Welsh), which, at 1,085&nbsp;m (3,560&nbsp;ft) is the highest peak in Wales. The 14 (or possibly 15) Welsh mountains over 3,000&nbsp;feet (914&nbsp;m) high are known collectively as the [[Welsh 3000s]]. Wales borders England to the east and the sea in the other three directions: the [[Bristol Channel]] to the south, [[St George's Channel]] to the west, and the [[Irish Sea]] to the north. Wales has over 1,200&nbsp;km (750&nbsp;miles) of coastline. There are several [[island]]s off the Welsh mainland, the largest being [[Anglesey]] (''Ynys MÃ´n'') in the northwest.

[[Geography of Ireland|Northern Ireland]] accounts for just {{convert|14160|km2|sqmi|-1}} and is mostly hilly. It includes [[Lough Neagh]], at {{convert|388|km2|sqmi|0}}, the largest body of water in the UK and [[Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/geog.htm |title=Geography of Northern Ireland |publisher=University of Ulster |accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref> The highest peak is [[Slieve Donard]] at {{convert|849|m|ft|0}} in the province's [[Mourne Mountains]].

=== Cities and conurbations ===
{{main|List of largest United Kingdom settlements by population|List of conurbations in the United Kingdom}}
The capitals of the individual countries of the UK are: [[Belfast]] (Northern Ireland), [[Cardiff]] (Wales), [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland) and  [[London]] (England); the latter is also the capital of the UK as a whole.

{{Largest cities of the United Kingdom}}

The largest conurbations are as follows:

At the April [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK Census]], the total population of the United Kingdom was 58,789,194, the third largest in the [[European Union]] (after [[Germany]] and [[France]]), the fifth largest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the twenty-first largest in the world.

===Ethnic groups===
{{main|Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom}}
The present day population of the UK is descended from varied ethnic stocks though mainly [[Cruthin|pre-Celtic]], [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Roman citizenship|Roman]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Normans|Norman]]. Since 1945, substantial immigration from [[Africa]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[South Asia]] has been a legacy of ties forged by the [[British Empire]]. Migration from new EU member states in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups, but, as of 2008, the trend is reversing and many of these migrants are returning home, leaving the size of these groups unknown.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7374683.stm 'Why I left UK to return to Poland'], BBC News</ref> As of [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001]], 92.1% of the population identified themselves as White, leaving 7.9%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=764&Pos=4&ColRank=1&Rank=176 |title=Ethnicity: 7.9% from a non-White ethnic group |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=2004-06-24 |accessdate = 2007-04-02}}</ref> of the UK population identifying themselves as mixed race or [[Minority group|ethnic minority]].

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Anglospeak.svg|thumb|250px|Countries where [[English language|English]] has ''de facto'' or ''de jure'' official language status.]]

Though the UK does not ''[[de facto|de jure]]'' have an official language; the predominant [[spoken language]] is [[English language|English]], a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] descended from [[Old English language|Old English]] featuring a large number of borrowings from [[Old Norse]], [[Norman language|Norman]] [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]]. The English language has spread across the world (largely due to the British Empire) and has thus become [[International English|the business language of the world]]. Worldwide, it is [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|taught as a second language]] more than any other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=2055 |title=English-Language Dominance, Literature and Welfare |author=Jacques Melitz |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=1999 |accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>

The other indigenous languages of the UK are [[Scots language|Scots]] (which is closely related to English) and four [[Celtic languages]]. The latter fall into two groups: two P-Celtic languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]]); and two Q-Celtic languages ([[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]). Celtic dialectal influences from [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] persisted in Northern England for centuries, most famously in a unique set of numbers used for counting sheep (see [[Yan Tan Tethera]]). In the 2001 Census over a fifth (21%) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh, <ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=447&Pos=6&ColRank=1&Rank=192 National Statistics Online<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.statistics.gov.uk</ref> an increase from the 1991 Census (18%). <ref>http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fow/WelshLanguage.pdf</ref> In addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/multilingual/welsh.shtml Welsh today by Prof. Peter Wynn Thomas]bbc.co.uk</ref> Welsh and Scottish Gaelic are also spoken by small groups around the globe with some [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic]] still spoken in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], and Welsh in [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].

Speakers of immigrant languages constitute up to 10% of the UK's population, [[French language|French]] is spoken by 2.3% of the country's population, 1.0% of Britons speak [[Polish language|Polish]] reflecting the recent mass migration to the UK. 0.9% of the UK's population speak [[German language|German]] and 0.8% [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The majority of other foreign languages spoken in the UK originate from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. A large percentage of the immigrants to the UK come from [[Anglophone]] countries (such as [[Nigeria]], [[Jamaica]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[Philippines]]), which is why there is not a great deal of diversity between some of the country's ethnic minority communities.

Across the United Kingdom, it is generally compulsory for pupils to study a foreign language to some extent: up to the age of 14 in England, up to age 16 in Scotland. [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland, though Welsh is the main second language taught in Wales. According to a survey in 2003, 89% of British people have a basic level of French language, and a further 23% have a basic knowledge of [[German language|German]]. Other languages becoming more popular include 7% [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and 0.5% [[Russian language|Russian]].

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom and the countries that preceded it have long traditions of [[Christianity]] and a link between [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] still remains in England. Research suggests that 38% of the population have a belief in a [[God]] with a further 40% believing in a 'spirit or life force'.<ref name=Eurobarometer>{{PDFlink|[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf Eurobarometer poll conducted in 2005]|1.64&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1722129 bytes -->}}. Page 9. European Commission. Retrieved on 7 December 2006</ref> People identify themselves with [[religion]] in the UK for both cultural and religious reasons and this is reflected by the disparity between the figures for those proclaiming a belief in a God and those identifying themselves with a particular religion. Christianity has the largest number of adherents followed by Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and Judaism.

==== Christianity ====
[[Image:Westminster abbey west.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Westminster Abbey]] is used for the [[coronation]] of [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarchs]], when they are also made the head of the [[Church of England]].]]

[[Christianity]] is the major religion with many Christian [[Church (building)|churches]], [[Christian denomination|denominations]], and [[Group (sociology)|groups]].

The [[Church of England]], which split from [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] in 1534 (see [[English Reformation]]) is, today, the '[[Established church|established]]' Church in England: the church retains a [[Lords Spiritual|representation]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] is a member of the Church (required under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]) as well as its [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]].  Though the direct influence of the [[Church of England]] has been on the decline for years, it retains the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration), through the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]], that can then be passed into law by Parliament.

The [[Church of Scotland]] (known informally as the [[Kirk]]), which broke with Rome in 1560 (see [[Calvinism]] and [[Scottish Reformation]]) is a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, recognised as the [[national church]] of Scotland, and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member, and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the Church at the coronation. The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which is now part of the Anglican Communion, dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690, when it split from the Church of Scotland, and is not a 'daughter church' of the Church of England. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the nineteenth century, led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the [[Free Church of Scotland (post-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

In the 1920s, the [[Church in Wales]] was separated from the Church of England and became '[[Disestablishmentarianism|disestablished]]'. The Church in Wales remains in the [[Anglican Communion]]. [[Methodism]] and other independent churches are traditionally strong in Wales.

The Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] was disestablished in the nineteenth century. It covers the entire island of [[Ireland]] (both [[Northern Ireland]] and the state of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]). In Northern Ireland the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic Church in Ireland]] is the largest single denomination, although [[Protestantism|Protestants]] are in the majority overall. The [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] is the largest Protestant denomination and is in terms of theology and history closely linked to the Church of Scotland

The [[Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic Church]] is the second largest denomination of Christianity in the UK. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], strict laws were passed against Catholics; these were removed by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] laws in 1829. There are separate Catholic hierarchies for [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Ireland]].

Other large Christian groups include the [[Methodism|Methodists]] (founded by [[John Wesley]] in London) and the [[Baptist]]s. There are also growing [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches, many of which have flourished with [[Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)|immigration]] from around the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and beyond. Pentecostal churches are now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article757934.ece 'Fringe' Church winning the believers] Timesonline, 19 December 2006</ref>

The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in the United Kingdom with an initial concentration on heavy industries such as [[shipbuilding]], [[coal mining]], [[steel]] production, and [[textile]]s. The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy, but accounted for only one-sixth of national output in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/ministers/speeches/hewitt150704b.html |title=TUC Manufacturing Conference |author=Patricia Hewitt |publisher=Department for Trade and Industry |date=2004-07-15 |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> The [[British motor industry]] is a significant part of this sector, although it has diminished with the collapse of the [[MG Rover Group]] and most of the industry is foreign owned. Civil and defence aircraft production is led by the United Kingdom's largest aerospace firm, [[BAE Systems]], and the continental European firm [[EADS]], the owner of [[Airbus]]. [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] holds a major share of the global aerospace engines market. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is strong in the UK, with the world's second and sixth largest pharmaceutical firms ([[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[AstraZeneca]], respectively)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/sectors/biotech/pharmaceutical/page10219.html |title=The Pharmaceutical sector in the UK |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=Department of Trade and Industry}}</ref> being based in the UK.

Government involvement throughout the economy is exercised by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (currently [[Alistair Darling]]) who heads [[HM Treasury]], but the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] (currently ''The Rt Hon'' [[Gordon Brown]] MP), is [[First Lord of the Treasury]]; the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the Second Lord of the Treasury. In recent years, the UK economy has been managed in accordance with principles of market liberalisation and low taxation and regulation. Since 1997, the [[Bank of England]]'s [[Monetary Policy Committee]], headed by the [[Governor of the Bank of England]], has been responsible for setting [[official bank rate|interest rates]] at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year.<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/more_about.htm More About the Bank] www.bankofengland.co.uk, accessed 8 August 2008 </ref>  The Scottish Government, subject to the approval of the Scottish Parliament, has the power to vary the basic rate of income tax payable in Scotland by plus or minus 3 pence in the pound, though this power has not yet been exercised.

Each country of the United Kingdom has a separate public healthcare system, with power over the provision of health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved. Though each provides healthcare that is generally free to patients, being funded from general taxation, considerable differences are now developing between the different systems.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] [[BBC]] 2 January 2008</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7457357.stm  A four-way split on the NHS] BBC News, 4 July 2008</ref>  A much smaller private medical system also exists. The UK and devolved governments take on both the role of suppliers of public healthcare and assessors of the quality of its delivery.   Various regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the [[General Medical Council]], the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] and non-governmental-based (e.g. [[Royal College]]s). Across the UK, there is a large number of [[medical school]]s and [[dentistry|dental schools]], and a considerable establishment for training [[nurse]]s and professions allied to medicine.

[[Healthcare in England]] is mainly provided by the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] which covers just England though the name [[National Health Service]] is also used as the collective name of all four public health systems in the UK. The NHS (originally covering England and Wales) was set up by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] and came into effect on 5 July 1948. The [[Secretary of State for Health]] is answerable to the UK Parliament for the running of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and for the work of the NHS (in England). The NHS is one of the largest cohesive organisations of any type in the world employing over 1.3&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6450303.stm |title=NHS workforce 'falls by 11,000' |publisher=BBC News, |date=2007-03-14}}</ref> Public sector healthcare delivery consists of primary ([[General practitioner|general practice]]), secondary ([[hospital|district general hospital]]) and tertiary ([[teaching hospital]]) levels of service.  There is considerable interaction and cross-flow between the various levels. The [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]], or NICE, advises on whether drugs or treatments should be provided on the NHS in England and Wales.

[[Healthcare in Scotland]] is mainly provided by [[NHS Scotland]], Scotland's public healthcare system. The service was founded by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. However, even  prior to 1948, half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by state funded healthcare, provided by the [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]].<ref>[http://www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk/history/birth-of-nhs-scotland/highlands-and-islands-medical-service.html Highlands and Islands Medical Service (HIMS)] www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk, accessed 28 July 2008</ref> In 2006, NHS Scotland employed around 158,000 staff including more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. In addition, there were also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances.<ref>[http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/introduction.aspx About the NHS in Scotland] NHS Scotland</ref> The [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing]] is responsible to the Scottish Parliament for the work of NHS Scotland.

[[NHS Wales|Healthcare in Wales]] is mainly provided by [[NHS Wales]]. Originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]], power over the NHS in Wales was transferred to the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969.<ref>[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?pid=11595&orgid=452 Introduction to NHS Wales 1960s] www.wales.nhs.uk </ref> In turn, responsibility for NHS Wales was passed to the Welsh Assembly and Executive under devolution in 1999. NHS Wales provides public healthcare in Wales and employs some 90,000 staff, making it Walesâ biggest employer.<ref>[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?pid=11590&orgid=452 Introduction to NHS Wales - Staff] www.wales.nhs.uk </ref> The Minister for Health and Social Services is the person within the Welsh Assembly Government who holds cabinet responsibilities for both health and social care in Wales.

There are a further {{convert|213750|km|mi|0}} of paved roads. The [[Network Rail|rail network]] of 16,116&nbsp;km (10,072 miles) in Great Britain and 303&nbsp;route&nbsp;km (189 route&nbsp;mi) in [[Northern Ireland]] carries over 18,000 passenger trains and 1,000 freight trains daily. Urban rail networks are well developed in London and other cities. There was once over 48,000 route&nbsp;km (30,000 route&nbsp;mi) of rail network in the UK, however most of this was reduced over a time period from 1955 to 1975, much of it after a report by a government advisor [[Richard Beeching]] in the mid 1960s (known as the [[Beeching Axe]]).

== Sport ==
{{main|Sport in the United Kingdom}}
Many major [[sport]]s originated in the United Kingdom, including [[Association football]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]] and [[golf]]. A poll found that football is the most popular [[sport in the United Kingdom]].<ref>[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/sport/sports-tracker-05.pdf MORI Sports Tracker 1996-2005<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Internationally, [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]] compete separately in most team sports, as well as at the [[Commonwealth Games]], and in sporting contexts the four can be referred to collectively as the [[Home Nations]]. There are national sports teams representing the United Kingdom, including [[Great Britain national basketball team]] and [[Great Britain at the Olympics]], though the Scottish Government is calling for Scotland to have its own, separate team when London hosts the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7579124.stm  New call for Scottish 2012 team] bbc.co.uk, accessed 24 August 2008</ref>

Football is organised on a separate basis for each of the countries of the United Kingdom, and each has its own Football Association, national team and [[league system]], though a few clubs play outside their country's respective systems for a variety of historical and logistical reasons.  [[Association football|Football]] was developed in the UK and is comfortably the most popular sport.

[[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] compete as separate countries in international competition and, as a consequence, the UK does not compete as a single team in football events at the [[Olympic Games]]. There are [[United Kingdom national football team|proposals to have a UK team]] take part in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] but the [[Scottish Football Association|Scottish]], [[Football Association of Wales|Welsh]] and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Irish]] football associations have declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent status - a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/football/7286011.stm|title=Blatter against British 2012 team|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-03-09|accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref> England has been the most successful of the home nations, winning the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] [[1966 FIFA World Cup|on home soil in 1966]], although there has historically been a close-fought [[England and Scotland football rivalry|rivalry between England and Scotland]].

The [[English football league system]] includes hundreds of inter-linked leagues, consisting of thousands of divisions. The [[Premier League|Premiership]] at the top, is the most-watched football league in the world and is particularly popular in [[Asia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3207829.stm |title=Chinese phone maker's fancy footwork |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-27 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> Below this, [[The Football League]] has three divisions and then the [[Football Conference]] has a national division and two feeder regional leagues. Thereafter the structure becomes increasing regional. England is home to world-renowned football clubs such as [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. English teams have been successful in European Competitions including some who have become European Cup/UEFA Champions League winners: [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (five times), [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (three times), [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (twice) and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. More clubs from England have won the European Cup than any other country (four compared to three from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands). Moreover, England ranks second in the all time list of European club trophies won with 35, one behind Italy's 36. The European Cup competition itself came about as the result of the success of another English club, [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], against top European sides<ref>http://galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~mirad/archive.html EuroCups Archive</ref> in the 1950s. The 90,000-capacity [[Wembley Stadium]] is England's principal sporting stadium.

The [[Scottish football league system]] has two national leagues: the [[Scottish Premier League]], the top division of play, and the [[Scottish Football League]], which has three divisions. Below this, but not connected to the national leagues, are three regional leagues; the [[Highland Football League]], the [[East of Scotland Football League]] and the [[South of Scotland Football League]]. One English club, [[Berwick Rangers F.C.|Berwick Rangers]], plays in the Scottish system. Scotland is home to two world-renowned football clubs in the [[Old Firm]] of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Scottish teams that have been successful in European Competitions include [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] ([[European Cup 1966â67|European Cup in 1967]]), [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] ([[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1971â72|European Cup Winners' Cup in 1972]]) and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] ([[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1982â83|European Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[1983 UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup in 1983]]). Celtic were the first British club to win the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]]. 

The [[Welsh football league system]] includes the [[Welsh Premier League]] and regional leagues. Welsh Premiership club [[The New Saints F.C.|The New Saints]] play their home matches on the English side of the border in [[Oswestry]]. The Welsh clubs of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Colwyn Bay F.C.|Colwyn Bay]], [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] play in the English system.  Cardiff's 76,250 seater [[Millennium Stadium]] is the principal sporting stadium of Wales.

The [[Northern Ireland football league system]] includes the [[IFA Premiership]]. One Northern Irish club, [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]], play their football outside of the UK in the [[FAI League of Ireland|Republic of Ireland football league system]].

=== Other sports ===
[[Image:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|The [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Championships, a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament, is held in [[Wimbledon, London]] every June/July.]]
[[Image:Royal & Ancient Clubhouse.jpg|thumb|[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]], generally regarded as the world's "Home of Golf".]]

Both forms of rugby are national sports. [[Rugby league]] originates from and is generally played in the [[Northern England]], while [[rugby union]] is played throughout the UK. Though supposedly originating from the actions of [[William Webb Ellis]] at the School at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], it is now considered the national sport of Wales. In [[rugby league]] the UK has been represented by a single 'Great Britain' team but this will change for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup in which Scotland, England and Ireland will compete as separate nations.<ref>[http://www.rlwc08.com/ Official Website of Rugby League World Cup 2008]</ref>  This bring it into line with rugby union in which England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland (which consists of players from [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and Northern Ireland) already compete in international competition. However, every four years a [[British and Irish Lions]] team tours Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, composed of players selected from all the Home nations.

[[Cricket]] was invented in [[England]] and the [[England cricket team]], controlled by the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]],<ref>[http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/about-ecb/ About ECB] www.ecb.co.uk, accessed 4 August 2008 </ref> is the only national team in the UK with [[Test cricket|Test status]]. Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. Cricket is distinct from Football and Rugby where Wales and England field separate national teams. [[Sport in Ireland|Irish]] and [[Cricket in Scotland|Scottish]] players have played for [[England]] because neither [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]] nor [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] have Test status and have only recently started to play in [[One Day International]]s. Scotland, England (and Wales), and Ireland (including Northern Ireland) have competed at the [[Cricket World Cup]], with England reaching the Final three times. There is a professional [[County Championship|league championship]] in which clubs representing 17 English counties and 1 Welsh county compete.

[[Snooker]] is also one of Great Britain's sporting exports. A game similar to [[cue sports|billiards]], the world championships are held annually in [[Sheffield]]. The sport continues to expand worldwide, with huge growth in China.

The game of [[tennis]] first originated from the City of [[Birmingham]] between 1859 and 1865. [[The Championships, Wimbledon]] are international [[tennis]] events held in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in south London every summer and are regarded as the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar.

[[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred racing]] is popular throughout the UK. It originated under [[Charles II of England]] as the "Sport of Kings" and is a royal pastime to this day. World-famous horse races include the [[Grand National]], the [[Epsom Derby]] and [[Ascot Racecourse#Royal Ascot|Royal Ascot]]. The town of [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] is considered the centre of English racing, largely due to the famous [[Newmarket Racecourse]].

The UK has proved successful in the international sporting arena in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. It is widely considered that the sport's most successful rower is [[Steve Redgrave]] who won five gold medals and one bronze medal at five consecutive [[Olympic Games]] as well as numerous wins at the [[World Rowing Championships]] and [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

Golf is one of the most popular participation sports played in the UK, with [[St Andrews]] in Scotland being the sport's home course.

[[Shinty]] (or ''camanachd'') is popular in the [[Scottish Highlands]], sometimes attracting crowds numbering thousands in the most sparsely populated region of the UK. Its premier tournament is the [[Camanachd Cup]].

The UK is closely associated with [[motorsport]]. Many teams and drivers in [[Formula One]] (F1) are based in the UK and drivers from Britain have won more world titles than any other country. The country hosts legs of the F1 and [[World Rally Championship]] and has its own [[touring car racing]] championship, the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC).

The [[British Grand Prix]] takes place at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] each July.

[[Dancesport]] or competitive Ballroom dancing has its origins in the UK when popular dancing at the time was codified by British dance schools from the 1920s onwards. For example, the Slow Waltz is still known as the English Waltz which is now as distinct from its original roots as its name, the Viennese Waltz. The UK remains a major centre for the sport and Ballroom dancing in general with the Empress Ballroom at the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]] in [[Blackpool]] being a popular venue for major competitions.

== Culture ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2008}}
{{main|Culture of the United Kingdom}}
The [[culture of the United Kingdom]]&mdash;British culture&mdash; is informed by the [[History of the United Kingdom|UK's history]] as a [[Developed country|developed]] [[island country]], [[monarchy]], [[Imperialism|imperial power]] and, particularly, as a [[political union]] of four countries, which each have their own preserved and distinctive heritage, customs and symbolism. As a result of the [[British Empire]], British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies such as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[India]], and the [[United States]].

=== Cinema ===
{{main|Cinema of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has been influential in the development of cinema, with the [[Ealing Studios]] claiming to be the oldest studios in the world. Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry is characterised by an ongoing debate about its identity, and the influences of American and European cinema. Particularly between British and American film, many films are often co-produced or share actors with many British actors now featuring regularly in Hollywood films. The [[BFI Top 100 British films]] is a poll conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] which ranks what they consider to be the 100 greatest British films of all time.

=== Literature ===
{{main|British literature}}
[[Image:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Chandos portrait]], believed to depict [[William Shakespeare]].]]
[[Image:Robert burns.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Burns]]]]

'British literature' refers to [[literature]] associated with the United Kingdom, the [[Isle of Man]] and the Channel Islands as well as to literature from England, Wales and Scotland prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. 

The English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]] is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109536 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562101/Shakespeare.html |title=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/Shakespeare,+William |title=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref> Among the earliest English writers are [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (12th century), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (14th century), and [[Thomas Malory]] (15th century). In the 18th century, [[Samuel Richardson]] is often credited with inventing the modern novel. In the 19th century, there followed further innovation by [[Jane Austen]], the [[BrontÃ«|BrontÃ« sisters]], the social campaigner [[Charles Dickens]], the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] [[Thomas Hardy]], the visionary poet [[William Blake]] and romantic poet [[William Wordsworth]]. Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist [[H. G. Wells]], the controversial [[D. H. Lawrence]], the [[modernism|modernist]] [[Virginia Woolf]], the prophetic novelist [[George Orwell]] and the poet [[John Betjeman]]. Most recently, the children's fantasy [[Harry Potter]] series by [[J. K. Rowling]] has recalled the popularity of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

[[Scottish literature|Scotland's contribution]] includes the detective writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], romantic literature by Sir [[Walter Scott]], the epic adventures of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and the celebrated poet [[Robert Burns]]. More recently, the modernist and nationalist [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] and [[Neil M. Gunn]] contributed to the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. A more grim outlook is found in [[Ian Rankin]]'s stories and the psychological horror-comedy of [[Iain Banks]]. Scotland's capital, [[Edinburgh]], is UNESCO's first worldwide city of literature.<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=27852&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html Edinburgh, UK appointed first UNESCO City of Literature] unesco.org, accessed 20 August 2008</ref>

In the early medieval period, Welsh writers composed the [[Mabinogion]]. In modern times, the poets [[R. S. Thomas]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] have brought Welsh culture to an international audience.

Authors from other nationalities, particularly from Ireland, or from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, have lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]], and more recently British authors born abroad such as [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] and Sir [[Salman Rushdie]].

In theatre, Shakespeare's contemporaries [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]] added depth. More recently [[Alan Ayckbourn]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Michael Frayn]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism.

[[Image:Channel 4 Building - Horseferry Road - London - 310504.jpg|thumb|The Channel 4 building.]]

There are five major nationwide television channels in the UK: [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Five (channel)|Five]] - currently transmitted by analogue terrestrial, free-to-air signals with the latter three channels funded by commercial advertising. In Wales, [[S4C]] the Welsh Fourth Channel replaces Channel 4, carrying Welsh language programmes at peak times. It also transmits Channel 4 programmes at other times.

The [[BBC]] is the UK's publicly funded [[radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. It operates several [[BBC Television|television channels]] and [[BBC Radio|radio]] stations in both the UK and abroad. The BBC's international television news service, [[BBC World News]], is broadcast throughout the world and the [[BBC World Service]] radio network is broadcast in thirty-three languages globally, as well as services in Welsh on [[BBC Radio Cymru]] and programmes in Gaelic on [[BBC Radio nan GÃ idheal]] in Scotland and Irish in Northern Ireland.

The domestic services of the BBC are funded by the [[television licence]], a legal requirement for any British household with a television receiver that is in use to receive broadcasts, regardless of whether or not the householders watch BBC channels. Households which are the principal residence of any person over 75 are exempt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/information/agedover74s.jsp|title=TV licensing: aged over 74}}</ref> and the requirement does not extend to radio listeners. The BBC World Service Radio is funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] and the television stations are operated by [[BBC Worldwide]] on a commercial subscription basis over cable and satellite services. It is this commercial arm of the BBC that forms half of [[UKTV]] along with [[Virgin Media]].

The UK now has a large number of digital terrestrial channels including a further six from the BBC, five from ITV and three from Channel 4, and one from S4C which is solely in Welsh, among a variety of others.

The vast majority of digital [[cable television]] services are provided by [[Virgin Media]] with [[satellite television]] available from [[Freesat]] or [[British Sky Broadcasting]] and [[free-to-air]] digital terrestrial television by [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. The entire country [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#Digital switchover|will switch to digital]] by 2012.

[[Radio in the United Kingdom|Radio in the UK]] is dominated by [[BBC Radio]], which operates ten national networks and over forty local radio stations. The most popular radio station, by number of listeners, is [[BBC Radio 2]], closely followed by [[BBC Radio 1]]. There are hundreds of mainly local commercial radio stations across the country offering a variety of music or talk formats.

Traditionally, [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British newspapers]] could be split into ''quality'', serious-minded newspaper (usually referred to as "[[broadsheet]]s" due to their large size) and the more populist, ''[[tabloid]]'' varieties. For convenience of reading, many traditional broadsheets have switched to a more [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]]-sized format, traditionally used by [[tabloid]]s. ''[[The Sun]]'' has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper in the UK, with approximately a quarter of the market; its sister paper, ''[[News of the World|The News of the World]]'' similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,1782,00.html |title=ABC Newspaper Circulation Figures |publisher=The Times |date=2006-05-12 |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> and traditionally focuses on celebrity-led stories.

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' is the main business paper, printed on distinctive salmon-pink broadsheet paper.

First printed in 1737, the ''[[The News Letter|Belfast News Letter]]'' is the oldest known English-language daily newspaper still in publication today. One of its fellow Northern Irish competitors, ''[[The Irish News]]'', has been twice ranked as the best regional newspaper in the United Kingdom, in 2006 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newspaperawards.co.uk/default.htm |title=The Newspaper Awards |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

Aside from newspapers, British magazines and journals have achieved worldwide circulation including ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.

Scotland has a distinct tradition of newspaper readership (see [[list of newspapers in Scotland]]). The tabloid ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper outselling the ''[[The Sun#The Scottish Sun|Scottish Sun]]'' by four to one while its sister paper, the ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market.

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Beatlessullivantogether.jpg|thumb|[[The Beatles]] were and still are considered one of the world's greatest bands.]]

Notable composers of Classical music from the United Kingdom and the countries that preceded it have included [[William Byrd]], [[Henry Purcell]], Sir [[Edward Elgar]], Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]] (most famous for working with librettist Sir [[W. S. Gilbert]]), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and [[Benjamin Britten]], pioneer of modern British [[opera]]. 

Prominent among the UK contributors to the development of [[rock music]] in the 1960s and 1970s were [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Slade]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2245820.stm Honorary award for glam rockers] BBC News, 9 September, 2002 </ref>, [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Who]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Black Sabbath]]. [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]], [[hard rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[New Wave music|New Wave]] were among the variations that followed. In the early 1980s, UK bands from the [[New Romantic]] scene such as [[Duran Duran]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Spandau Ballet]], [[Soft Cell]] and [[Ultravox]] were prominent. In the 1990s, [[Britpop]] bands and [[electronica]] music attained international success. More recent pop acts, including [[The Smiths]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Coldplay]], and the [[Spice Girls]], have ensured the continuation of the UK's massive contribution to popular music.

In 2008, [[Glasgow]] was named a United Nations City of Music, one of only three cities in the world to have this honour.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7570915.stm  Glasgow gets city of music honour] bbc.co.uk, accessed 20 August 2008 </ref>

=== Philosophy ===

The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of "British Empiricism", a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid. The most famous philosophers of this tradition are [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]]. Britain is notable for a theory of moral philosophy, Utilitarianism, first used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and later by [[John Stuart Mill]], in his short work ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]''. Other eminent philosophers from the UK and the countries that preceded it include [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Alfred Ayer]]. Foreign-born philosophers who settled in the UK include [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

The United Kingdom and the countries that preceded it have produced scientists and engineers credited with important advances, including;
* The modern scientific method, developed by [[English people|English]] philosopher [[Francis Bacon]] 
* The [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and illumination of [[gravitation|gravity]], by [[English people|English]] [[physicist]], [[mathematician]], [[Astronomy|astronomer]], [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], [[Alchemy|alchemist]] and [[Theology|theologian]], Sir [[Isaac Newton]]

* The structure of [[DNA]], by [[Francis Crick]] and others
* The development of the [[World Wide Web#Origins|World Wide Web]], largely attributed to [[Tim Berners-Lee]]

Notable [[civil engineering]] projects, whose pioneers included [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], contributed to the world's first national railway transport system. Other advances pioneered in the UK include the [[marine chronometer]], the [[jet engine]], the modern [[bicycle]], [[Lamp (electrical component)|electric lighting]], the [[electric motor]], the [[propeller|screw propeller]], the [[internal combustion engine]], military [[radar]], the electronic [[computer]], [[vaccination]] and [[antibiotic]]s.

Scientific journals produced in the UK include ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' and ''[[The Lancet]]''. In 2006, it was reported that the UK provided 9% of the world's scientific research papers and a 12% share of citations, the second highest in the world after the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,1736095,00.html |title=Britain second in world research rankings |publisher=The Guardian |date=2006-03-21 |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref>

{{main|Art of the United Kingdom}}

The [[Royal Academy]] is located in London. Other major schools of art include the [[Slade School of Fine Art]]; the six-school [[University of the Arts London]], which includes the [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]] and [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]]; the [[Glasgow School of Art]], and [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]. This commercial venture is one of Britain's foremost visual arts organisations. Major British artists include Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[John Constable]], [[William Blake]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[William Morris]], [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[David Hockney]], [[Gilbert and George]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Antony Gormley]], and [[Anish Kapoor]].

[[Image:Britannia-Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|The Statue of [[Britannia]] in [[Plymouth]]. Britannia is a [[national personification]] of the UK.]]
* The [[flag of the United Kingdom]] is the [[Union Flag]] commonly known as the "Union Jack". It was created by the superimposition of the flags of [[Flag of England|England]] ([[St George's Cross]]) and [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] ([[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]]), with [[Saint Patrick's Flag|Saint Patrick's cross]], to represent Ireland, being added to this in 1801. [[Wales]] is not represented in the Union Flag as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom.  However, the possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7114248.stm Welsh dragon call for Union flag] BBC News, 27 November 2007 </ref>

* The [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom is "[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]", with "King" replaced with "Queen" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is female. The anthem's name, however, remains "God Save the King". 

* [[Britannia]] is a [[National personification|personification]] of the United Kingdom, originating from the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]] of southern and central Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins |publisher=Chard |accessdate=2006-06-25}}</ref> Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a [[shield]], bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding the back of a lion. At and since the height of the British Empire, Britannia has often associated with maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]''.

* The [[lion]] symbol is depicted behind Britannia on the [[British fifty pence coin|50 pence]] piece and one is shown crowned on the back of the [[British ten pence coin|10 pence]] piece. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the [[British Army]]. 

* The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of [[Great Britain]], and has been associated with [[Winston Churchill]]'s defiance of Nazi Germany.

=== National symbols within the United Kingdom ===
{{main|National symbols of Scotland}}
* A number of 'national anthems' are used for the individual countries of the UK with varying degrees of popular acceptance, the most popular being [[Flower of Scotland]], [[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]] in Wales, [[Londonderry Air]] in Northern Ireland and [[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]] in England.

* [[Lion]]s have been used as [[heraldry|heraldic devices]], including in the royal arms of the kingdoms of [[Coat of arms of England|England]], [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in [[Wales]]. The lion is featured on the emblem of the [[England national football team]], giving rise to the popular football anthem ''[[Three Lions]]'', and the [[England cricket team]]. The "three lions" on the English coat of arms were originally two leopards. An extra leopard was added by [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and with the help of his name, they became known as three lions. They are now drawn to look more like lions. Leopards are traditionally depicted lying down whereas lions were drawn standing on all fours or up on their hind legs attacking, as in the Scottish [[Lion (heraldry)|Lion Rampant]]. 

* England (and sometimes Britain) has been personified as the character [[John Bull]], although this character is rarely used in modern times.

* The [[oak]] tree and the [[rose]] have long been a widely used proxy for the visual representation of English identity. The red rose is the emblem of the [[England national rugby union team]] and the [[Rugby Football Union]]. 

* The [[thistle]] is widely used as a Scottish symbol. 

* The [[Narcissus (genus)|daffodil]] and [[leek]] are used as Welsh symbols.

There is no official National [[flag of Northern Ireland]] following the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]] or any unofficial flag universally supported in Northern Ireland. The use of various flags in Northern Ireland is contentious. However, the [[Ulster Banner]] is often used for sporting events. See [[Northern Ireland flags issue]] and [http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-04474.pdf The Union Flags and flags of the United Kingdom]</div>
