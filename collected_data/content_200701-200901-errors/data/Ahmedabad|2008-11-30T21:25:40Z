'''Ahmedabad''' ({{lang-gu|અમદાવાદ ''Amdāvād''}}, [[Hindi]]: अहमदाबाद {{IPAudio|lang=Hindi|Ahmedabad.ogg|''Ahmadābād''}}) is the largest city in the [[Indian state|state]] of [[Gujarat]] and one of the [[List of most populous metropolitan areas in India|largest urban agglomerations]] in [[India]], with a population of 45&nbsp;[[lakh]]s (4.5&nbsp;million).<ref name="population">{{cite web

}}</ref> Located on the banks of the [[Sabarmati River|River Sabarmati]], the city is the administrative centre of [[Ahmedabad district]] and was the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of Gujarat from 1960 to 1970; the capital was shifted to [[Gandhinagar]] thereafter. In colloquial Gujarati, it is commonly called Amdavad.

Ahmedabad was founded in 1411 by [[Ahmed Shah of Gujarat|Sultan Ahmed Shah]] to serve as the capital of the [[Muzaffarid dynasty|Sultanate of Gujarat]]. The city is named after its founder. Under [[British Raj|British rule]], a military [[cantonment]] was established and the city infrastructure was modernised and expanded. Although incorporated into the [[Bombay Presidency]] during the British rule in India, Ahmedabad remained the most important city in the Gujarat region. The city established itself as the home of a booming textile industry, which earned it the nickname "''the [[Manchester]] of the East''."<ref>{{cite book|last=Engineer|first=Ashgar Ali|title=The Gujarat Carnage|publisher=Orient Longman|year=2003|isbn=8125024964|pages=196}}</ref><ref name = "jnnurm"/> The city was at the forefront of the [[Indian independence movement]] in the first half of the 20th century.<ref name="manchester">{{cite news |author=A.

With the [[States Reorganisation Act|creation of the state of Gujarat]] in 1960, Ahmedabad gained prominence as the political and commercial capital of the state. Once characterised by dusty roads and [[bungalow]]s, the city is witnessing a major construction boom and population increase. A rising centre of education, [[information technology]] and scientific industries, Ahmedabad remains the [[Culture of India|cultural]] and [[Economy of India|commercial]] heart of Gujarat and much of western India.

{{main|History of Ahmedabad}}
[[Image:Cloth map of ahmedabad.jpg|thumb|Map of Ahmedabad, depicted in a miniature style painting on a cloth, circa 19th century]]
Archaeological evidence suggests that the area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, when it was known as ''Ashapalli'' or ''[[Ashaval]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Jane|title=The Dictionary of Art|publisher=Grove|volume=1|isbn=1884446000|pages=471|ISBN status=May be invalid - please double check}}</ref> At that time, [[Karandev I]], the [[Solanki]] ruler of Anhilwara (modern [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]]), waged a successful war against the [[Bhil]] king of Ashaval,<ref>{{cite book| last=Michell|first=George|coauthors=Shah, Snehal; Burton-Page, John; Mehta, Dinesh|title=Ahmadabad|publisher=Marg Publications|date=28 July 2006|isbn=8185026033|pages=17–19}}</ref> and established a city called ''Karnavati'' located at the present time area of Maninagar close to the river Sabarmati. Solanki rule lasted until the 13th century, when Gujarat came under the control of the [[Vaghela dynasty]] of [[Dholka]] and Karnavati was conquered by the [[Sultanate of Delhi]]. In 1411, the rule of the [[Muzaffarid dynasty]] was established in Gujarat. According to legend, Sultan [[Ahmed Shah of Gujarat|Ahmed Shah]], while camping on the banks of the River Sabarmati, saw a hare chasing a dog. Impressed by this act of bravery, the Sultan, who had been looking for a place to build his new capital, decided to locate the capital at this forest area close by to Karnavati right on the river bank and christened it Ahmedabad.<ref>

The Mughal ruler [[Shahjahan]] spent the prime of his life in the city, sponsoring the construction of the [[Moti Shahi Mahal]] in [[Shahibaug]].

A military cantonment was established in 1824 and a municipal government in 1858. In 1864, a railway link between Ahmedabad and [[Mumbai]] (then Bombay) was established by the [[Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway]] (BB&CI), making Ahmedabad an important junction in the traffic and trade between [[North India|northern]] and [[South India|southern India]]. Large numbers of people migrated from rural areas to work in textile mills, establishing a robust industry.

[[Image:Gandhi home.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sabarmati Ashram]], home of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]]]
The [[Indian independence movement]] developed strong roots in the city when, in 1915, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] established two [[ashram]]s &mdash; the [[Kochrab Ashram]] near [[Paldi]] in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram (now [[Sabarmati Ashram]]) on the banks of the Sabarmati in 1917 &mdash; that would become centers of intense nationalist activities. During the [[Non-Cooperation Movement|mass protests]] against the [[Rowlatt Act]] in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite web

In 1930, Gandhi initiated the [[Salt Satyagraha]] from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the famous [[Dandi Salt March]]. The city administration and economic institutions were rendered functionless by the large masses of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests in the early 1930s, and again in 1942 during the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]]. Following independence and the [[partition of India]] in 1947, the city was scarred by intense communal violence that broke out between [[Hinduism in India|Hindus]] and [[Islam in India|Muslims]].

Ahmedabad became the capital of the new state of Gujarat after the bifurcation of the [[Bombay State|State of Bombay]] on 1 May 1960. During that period, a large number of educational and research institutions were founded in the city, making it a major center of [[Education in India|higher education]], science and technology. Ahmedabad's economic base was diversified with the establishment of [[heavy industry|heavy]] and [[chemical industry|chemical industries]] in its vicinity around the same period. But the growth in the next two decades was punctuated by political events in and around the city. In 1974, Ahmedabad occupied the centre stage in national politics with the launch of the ''[[Nav Nirman]]'' agitation &mdash; a protest against a 20% hike in the hostel food fees at the [[L.D. College of Engineering]] that snowballed into a mass agitation against general corruption to remove [[Chimanbhai Patel]], then-chief minister of Gujarat.<ref>{{cite web

==Geography and climate==
{{main|Geography of Ahmedabad}}
[[Image:River-Sabarmati-1.jpg|thumb|right|River Sabarmati]]
[[Image:Vastrapurlake.jpg|thumb|right|Vastrapur Lake]]
Ahmedabad is located at {{coord|23.03|N|72.58|E|}} in western India at an elevation of 53&nbsp;metres (174&nbsp;ft). The city sits on the banks of the River [[Sabarmati]], in north-central Gujarat. It spans an area of 205&nbsp;km² (79.15 square miles). The Sabarmati frequently dries up in the summer, leaving only a small stream of water. The city is located in a sandy and dry area. Many of the localities and roads are often spread in sand, reflecting the intensifying fallout caused by [[deforestation]]. The steady expansion of the [[Rann of Kutch]] threatens to increase [[desertification]] around the city area and much of the state. Except for the small hills of [[Thaltej-Jodhpur Tekra]], the city is almost flat. Two lakes are within the city's limits &mdash; [[Kankaria|Kankaria Lake]] and [[Vastrapur Lake]]. Kankaria lake, in the neighbourhood of [[Maninagar]], is an artificial lake developed by the Sultan of Delhi, [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]], in 1451.<ref name="kankaria">{{cite book|title=Gujarat State gazetteers|publisher=Directorate of Govt, Print., Stationery and Publications, Gujarat State|year=1984|pages=46}}</ref> According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-III]], in a scale of I to V (in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes)<ref name="hazardprofile">{{cite web

There are three main seasons: summer, [[monsoon]] and winter. Aside from the monsoon season, the climate is dry. The weather is hot through the months of March to June &mdash; the average summer maximum is 36&nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] (97&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]), and the average minimum is 23&nbsp;°C (73&nbsp;°F). From November to February, the average maximum temperature is 30&nbsp;°C (85&nbsp;°F), the average minimum is 15&nbsp;°C (59&nbsp;°F), and the climate is extremely dry. Cold northerly winds are responsible for a mild chill in January. The southwest monsoon brings a humid climate from mid-June to mid-September. The average rainfall is 93.2&nbsp;cm (36.7 inches), but infrequent heavy torrential rains cause the river to [[flood]]. The highest temperature recorded is 47&nbsp;°C (116.6&nbsp;°F) and the lowest is 5&nbsp;°C (41&nbsp;°F).<ref name="temperatures">{{cite web

Ahmedabad is divided by the Sabarmati into two physically distinct eastern and western regions. The eastern bank of the river houses the old city, which includes the central town of [[Bhadra]]. This part of Ahmedabad is characterised by packed bazaars, the clustered and barricaded ''[[pol (housing)|pol]]'' system of close clustered buildings, and numerous places of worship. It houses the main railway station, the [[General Post Office]], and few buildings of the Muzaffarid and British eras. The colonial period saw the expansion of the city to the western side of Sabarmati, facilitated by the construction of [[Ellis Bridge]] in 1875 and later with the modern [[Nehru Bridge]]. This part of the city houses educational institutions, modern buildings, well-planned residential areas, shopping malls, multiplexes and new business districts centred around some roads like [[Ashram Road]] and [[Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway]].<ref>

Ahmedabad has a thriving chemicals and [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceuticals industry]]. Two of the biggest pharmaceutical companies of India &mdash; [[Zydus Cadila]] and [[Torrent Pharmaceuticals]] &mdash; are based in the city. The city serves as the corporate headquarters of the [[Adani Group]], which is a leading multinational trading and infrastructure development company. The [[Nirma]] group of industries, which runs a large number of detergent and chemical industrial units, has its corporate headquarters in the city. In recent year many foreign companies have set up their sales offices and production facilities in Ahmedabad. Amongst them are [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch Rexroth]], Germany (hydraulic components); [[Stork N.V.|Stork]], Netherlands (textile machinery; joint venture with ATE, India's leading textile equipment trading house); [[Rollepaal]], Netherlands (pipe extrusion equipment); and Johnson Pumps, Sweden. 

The completion and operation of the [[Sardar Sarovar Project]] of dams and canals has improved the supply of potable water and electricity for the city. In recent years, the Gujarat government has increased investment in the modernisation of the city's infrastructure, providing for the construction of larger roads and improvements to water supply, electricity and communications.

A diverse labour force of migrant workers from different parts of Gujarat and neighbouring states is integral to the economy of the city. These workers provide vital household labour and services for the city's large middle class. Ahmedabad plays a strong and significant role in providing commercial resources and market access for the economies of neighbouring cities. A majority of the working-age citizens of Ahmedabad are traders and business people. This has led to the creation of major mercantile corporations and [[Artisan#Artisan guilds|artisan guilds]] that are a key influence on the economic life of Gujarat.

Ahmedabad enjoys a thriving cultural tradition, being the centre of Gujarati cultural activities and diverse traditions of different ethnic and religious communities. Popular celebrations and observances include [[Uttarayana|Uttarayan]] &mdash; an annual [[kite]]-flying day on 14 January. The nine nights of [[Navratri]] are celebrated with people performing [[Garba (dance)|Garba]] &mdash; the folk dance of Gujarat &mdash; at venues across the city. The festival of lights &mdash; [[Diwali|Deepavali]] is celebrated with the lighting of lamps in every house, the decorating the floors with the [[rangoli]] and the bursting of firecrackers. Other festivals such as [[Holi]], [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Christmas]] are celebrated with enthusiasm. The annual [[Rath Yatra]] procession on the ''Ashadh-sud-bij'' date of the [[Hindu calendar]] and the procession of ''Tajia'' during the Muslim holy month of [[Muharram]] are integral parts of the city's culture. 

The people of Ahmedabad enjoy rich [[Indian cuisine|culinary traditions]]. The most popular form of meal &mdash; a typical Gujarati ''thali'' (meal) &mdash; consists of [[roti|rotli]], [[dal]], rice and ''Shaak'' (cooked vegetables, sometimes with [[curry]]), with accompaniments of pickles and roasted ''papads''. Popular beverages include [[buttermilk]] and tea; sweet dishes include ''[[laddu|laddoos]]'' and [[mango]]. There are many restaurants, which serve a wide array of Indian and international cuisines.

The first all-vegetarian [[Pizza Hut]] in the world opened in Ahmedabad.<ref name="pizza">{{cite news |first= Sumitra|last=Senapaty|author=| coauthors =|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/life/2002/09/16/stories/2002091600150100.htm|title=Bon `veggie' appetit|work=Internet Edition|publisher=The Hindu Business Lines|pages=|page=|date=2002-11-16|accessdate=2006-07-30|language=}}</ref>

The [[Indian architecture|architectural]] history of Ahmedabad stretches across the last millennium. The Sultanate fused Hindu craftsmanship with [[Islamic architecture]], giving rise to the [[Indo-Saracenic]] style. Many [[mosque]]s in the city are built in this fashion. <ref>{{cite book

After independence modern buildings came up in Ahmedabad when renowned architects were given commissions in the city like [[Louis Kahn]] who designed the Indian Institute of Management; [[Le Corbusier]] who designed the Shodhan and Sarabhai Villas, the Sanskar Kendra and the Mill Owner's Association; and [[Buckminister Fuller]] who designed the Calico Dome. [[B. V. Doshi]] came to  the city from Paris to supervise [[Le Corbusier]]'s works and later set up the School of Architecture. His local masterpieces include Sangath, the Doshi-Hussain Gufa and the School of Architecture. [[Charles Correa]], who became a partner of Doshi's, designed the Gandhi Ashram and [[Achut Kanvinde]] the Indian Textile Industries Research Association. [[Christopher Charles Benninger]]'s first work, the Alliance Francaise, is located in the Ellis Bridge area. Hasmukh C. Patel, and his son Dr. Bimal Patel, are renowned architects of the city having designed the [[St. Xavier's High School Loyola Hall]], Gujarat High Court and the [[Ahmedabad Management Association]]. Anant Raje recently designed a major addition to Louis Kahn's campus, the Indian Institute of  Management.
