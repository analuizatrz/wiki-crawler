'''White Deer Hole Creek''' is a {{convert|20.5|mi|km|1|sing=on}} long [[tributary]] of the West Branch Susquehanna River in [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Clinton]], [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming]] and [[Union County, Pennsylvania|Union]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. A part of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] drainage basin, the White Deer Hole Creek [[Drainage basin|watershed]] drains parts of ten [[Township (Pennsylvania)|townships]]. The creek flows east in a valley of the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians]], through sandstone, limestone, and shale from the [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], and [[Devonian]] periods.

As of 2006, the creek and its {{convert|67.2|sqmi|sqkm|1}} watershed are relatively undeveloped, with 28.4% of the watershed given to agriculture and 71.6% covered by forest, including part of [[Tiadaghton State Forest]]. The western part of White Deer Hole Creek has very high water quality and is the only major creek in Lycoming County classified as "Class A Wild Trout Waters", defined by the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]] as "streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery."<ref name="class a">{{cite web  | author= [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]] (PFBC)  | url=  http://www.fish.state.pa.us/classa98.htm | title= 2007 CLASS A WILD TROUT WATERS | accessdate= 2007-09-18}}</ref> The rest of the creek and its major tributary (Spring Creek) are kept [[Fish stocking|stocked]]. There are opportunities in the watershed for [[canoeing]], [[hunting]], and [[camping]], and [[trail]]s for [[hiking]] and [[equestrianism|horseback riding]].

Historically, two paths of the native [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|indigenous peoples]] ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]]. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber [[clearcutting]] and small-scale lumbering continues. During [[World War II]] a [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] plant was built in the watershed, which became a federal prison in 1952. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] villages, the hamlet, and most of the farms (many [[Amish]]). 

==Name==
Two [[etymology|etymologies]] have been suggested for White Deer Hole Creek's unusual name. According to Donehoo, it is a translation of the [[Lenape language|Lenape]] ''Woap-achtu-woalhen'' (literally "white-deer digs a hole"), meaning "where the white deer digs". It is ''Opauchtooalin'' on the earliest map  showing the creek (1755), while a 1759 map has both ''Opaghtanoten'' and its translation, "White Flint Creek". These are seen as corruptions of ''Woap-achtu-woalhen'', and by 1770 (when the first settlers arrived) a map has "White Deer hole" (''sic'').<ref name ="donehoo"> {{cite book |last=Donehoo |first= Dr. George P. |title= A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania |origdate= 1928 |url= http://www.srbc.net/docs/IndianNamesDataChart.PDF|format= PDF|accessdate= 2006-11-09|edition= Second Reprint Edition |date= 1999|publisher= Wennawoods Publishing |location= [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]]|id= ISBN 1-889037-11-7|pages= 290|quote = ISBN refers to a 1999 reprint edition, URL is for the Susquehanna River Basin Commission's web page of Native American Place names, quoting and citing the book}}</ref>

In 1870, 88-year-old John Farley gave a second explanation of the name. His family had settled on the banks of White Deer Hole Creek in 1787, and John's father John built a mill on the creek by 1789. The creek was named because "a white deer is said to have been killed at an early day in a low hole or pond of water that once existed where my father built his mill". The "hole" was "a large circular basin of low ground of some ten&nbsp;acres in extent....after my father's mill and dam were built the water of the dam overflowed and covered the most of the hollow basin of ground."<ref name="history"> {{cite book | last = Meginness | first = John Franklin | title = History of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania: including its aboriginal history; the colonial and revolutionary periods; early settlement and subsequent growth; organization and civil administration; the legal and medical professions; internal improvement; past and present history of Williamsport; manufacturing and lumber interests; religious, educational, and social development; geology and agriculture; military record; sketches of boroughs, townships, and villages; portraits and biographies of pioneers and representative citizens, etc. etc."  | origdate = 1892 | url = http://www.usgennet.org/usa/pa/county/lycoming/history/lyco-history-01.html | accessdate = 2006-03-21 | edition = 1st Edition | publisher = Brown, Runk & Co. | location = Chicago, IL | id = ISBN 0-7884-0428-8 | chapter = Chapter XXXIX.

From the mouth of White Deer Hole Creek it is {{convert|17.7|mi|km|1}} along the West Branch Susquehanna River to its confluence with the [[Susquehanna River]] at [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania|Northumberland]].<ref name="river miles"/> The elevation at the source is {{convert|2180|ft|m|0}}, while the mouth is at an elevation of {{convert|445|ft|m|0}}. The difference in elevation, {{convert|1735|ft|m|0}}, divided by the length of the creek of {{convert|20.5|mi|km|1}} gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of creek or [[relief ratio]] of 84.6&nbsp;feet/mile (16.0&nbsp;m/km). The [[meander|meander ratio]] is 1.14, so the creek's path is not entirely straight in its bed.<ref name="Streams II"/> Its course meanders more the further east it flows.

For its entire length, White Deer Hole Creek runs along the north side of South White Deer Ridge, (an east-west ridge of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]). North White Deer Ridge and [[Bald Eagle Mountain]] form the northern edge of the creek valley. There are 24 unnamed tributaries on the south side of the creek, all flowing down the side of South White Deer Ridge, while there are only eleven tributaries on the north side, including Spring Creek.<ref name="dcnr"/>

White Deer Creek, the next major creek to the south, flows along the other side of South White Deer Ridge in Union County and is just {{convert|1.9|mi|km|1}} away (as measured along the West Branch Susquehanna River). The next major creek to the north is [[Muncy Creek]], {{convert|10.2|mi|km|1}} away along the river, but on the opposite bank. The next creek to the north on the same bank is "Black Hole Creek", on the south side of Bald Eagle Mountain. It has a small watershed of {{convert|21.1|sqmi|sqkm|1}} and enters the river {{convert|4.0|mi|km|1}} away at the borough of [[Montgomery, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]].<ref name="Streams II"/><ref name="river miles"/>

The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was 135&nbsp;cubic feet per second (3.82&nbsp;m³/s) and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was {{convert|4.29|ft|m|2}}, both on [[November 26]], [[1986]].<ref name="discharge"/> The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 70.4&nbsp;cubic feet per second (1.99&nbsp;m³/s), and ranged from a high of 111&nbsp;cubic feet per second (3.14&nbsp;m³/s) to a low of 33&nbsp;cubic feet per second (0.93&nbsp;m³/s).<ref name ="quality"/> There are no other known stream gauges on the creek.

==Watershed==
[[Image:4th Gap Tributary White Deer Hole Creek.JPG|thumb|left|200 px|The unnamed tributary in the Fourth Gap of South White Deer Ridge is also rated "Class A Wild Trout Waters".]]

The White Deer Hole Creek watershed is in Clinton (0.08%), Lycoming (4.40%), and Union (3.67%) counties. Neighboring watersheds are the West Branch Susquehanna River and its minor tributaries (north and east), White Deer Creek (south), and [[Fishing Creek (Bald Eagle Creek)|Fishing Creek]] (west). 

In 2000, the White Deer Hole Creek watershed population was 2,672.<ref name="watershed"/> In the 1970s, Amish began moving to the Elimsport area from [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]]. In 1995 there were over 200 Amish in more than twenty families (in comparison, Washington Township's population was 1,613 in 2000).<ref name="elimsport"/> Elimsport has Amish harness, machine repair, and food shops, and a new [[one-room school]] was built nearby in 1997.<ref>{{cite news |first= Dena|last= Pauling|title= Amish food store near Elimsport will remain open |publisher= [[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]] |date= [[August 25]], [[2005]] | page = B1, B3|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= James P.|last= Barr|title=  Amish Don't Want 'Anything Fancy': One-Room School Gets Zoning OK |publisher= [[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]] |date= [[July 24]], [[1997]] | page = A1, A6|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref>

The watershed area is {{convert|67|sqmi|sqkm|0}}, with {{convert|48|sqmi|sqkm|0}} of forest and {{convert|19|sqmi|sqkm|0}} for agriculture. By area, 1.1% of the watershed lies in Clinton County (in Crawford and [[Greene Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Greene]] Townships), 81.6% lies in Lycoming County (in [[Brady Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Brady]], [[Clinton Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Clinton]], Limestone, and Washington Townships), and 17.3% lies in Union County (in Gregg, [[Lewis Township, Pennsylvania|Lewis]], [[West Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania|West Buffalo]], and [[White Deer Township, Pennsylvania|White Deer]] Townships).<ref name="watershed"/>

Spring Creek is the major tributary, draining an area of {{convert|21.1|sqmi|sqkm|1}} or 31% of the total White Deer Hole Creek watershed. No other tributaries are named and only the area of the tributary in Beartrap Hollow is known, with {{convert|0.42|sqmi|sqkm|2}} or 0.63% of the total.<ref name="river miles"/>

===Water quality and pollution===
Clearcutting of forests in the early 20th century and the ordnance plant in the Second World War adversely affected the White Deer Hole Creek watershed's ecology and water quality.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nrdc.org/land/forests/fcut.asp | title = What Is Clearcutting? | accessdate = 2006-11-08 | author = Natural Resources Defense Council | authorlink = Natural Resources Defense Council}}</ref><ref name="oue">{{cite web | url = http://ouenews.org/ouehist.htm#The%20Early%20Years%20and%20the%20Fight%20Against%20the | title = OUE: A Brief History | accessdate = 2006-11-23 | date = June 1988 | publisher = Organizations United for the Environment}}</ref> Agricultural [[Surface runoff|runoff]] was and is another potential source of pollution.

The mean annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] for White Deer Hole Creek is 40 to 42&nbsp;inches (1,016 to 1,067&nbsp;mm).<ref name="Streams II"/> Pennsylvania receives the most [[acid rain]] of any state in the United States. Because the creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, it has a relatively low capacity to [[Neutralization|neutralize]] added acid. This makes it especially vulnerable to acid rain, which poses a threat to the long term health of the plants and animals in the creek.<ref>{{cite web | url = {{wayback|http://www.fish.state.pa.us/Fish/acidrain.htm}} | title = Acid Precipitation | publisher = Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission | accessdate = 2007-08-13}}</ref> The [[Alkalinity|total alkalinity]] of the "Class A Wild Trout Waters" is 2 for the 4.7&nbsp;miles (7.6&nbsp;km) of White Deer Hole Creek so classified, and 13 for the 3.0&nbsp;mile (4.8&nbsp;km) long unnamed tributary in the Fourth Gap.<ref name="class a"/>

==History==
===Native American paths===
[[Image:White Deer Hole Creek near 1st Gap.JPG|left|thumb|200px|White Deer Hole Creek near the First Gap in South White Deer Ridge. There are now hiking and horseback riding trails throughout its watershed.]]

The first recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the [[Susquehannock]]s, an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] speaking people. Their name meant "people of the muddy river" in [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]], but their name for themselves is unknown. Decimated by diseases and warfare, they had largely died out, moved away, or been [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were then chiefly occupied by the [[Christian Munsee|Munsee]] [[phratry]] of the [[Lenape]] (or ''Delaware''), and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the [[Iroquois]]. Two important paths of these native indigenous peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek.<ref name="history"/>

The [[Great Island Path]] was a major trail that ran north along the Susquehanna River from the [[Shamokin (village)|Saponi village of Shamokin]] at modern [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]], fording the river there and following the west bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River north until White Deer Hole valley. The path turned west at Allenwood and followed White Deer Hole Creek until about the present location of Elimsport. There it headed northwest, crossed North White Deer Ridge and passed west through the [[Nippenose Township, Pennsylvania|Nippenose]] valley, then turned north and crossed Bald Eagle Mountain via McElhattan Creek and ran along the south bank of the river to the Great Island (near the present day city of [[Lock Haven, Pennsylvania|Lock Haven]]). The stretch from the mouth of the creek to the Nippenose valley is approximately followed by Route 44. From the Great Island, the [[Great Shamokin Path]]  continued further west to the modern boroughs of [[Clearfield, Pennsylvania|Clearfield]] and [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania|Kittanning]], the last on the [[Allegheny River]].<ref name="path">{{cite book | last = Wallace | first = Paul A.W. | title = Indian Paths of Pennsylvania | edition = Fourth Printing | date = 1987 | publisher = Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission | location = [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] | id = ISBN 0-89271-090-X | quote = (Note: ISBN refers to 1998 impression.) | pages = pp. 42, 63–64}}</ref>

[[Culbertson's Path]] followed White Deer Hole Creek west from Allenwood, then followed Spring Creek north, crossed Bald Eagle Mountain and followed Mosquito Run to the river at the current borough of [[Duboistown, Pennsylvania|Duboistown]]. Here it crossed the river to "French Margaret's Town" (western modern day [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]) before joining the major [[Sheshequin Path]], which led north up [[Lycoming Creek]] to the North Branch of the Susquehanna River, modern [[New York]], and the Iroquois there. These trails were only wide enough for one person, but settlers in White Deer Hole valley broadened the path to DuBoistown to take grain to Culbertson's mill on Mosquito Run, hence the name.<ref name="path"/> In 2006, there is still a "Culbertson's Trail", for hiking over Bald Eagle Mountain from [[Pennsylvania Route 554]] to Duboistown.<ref name="dcnr"/>

===Lycoming County boundaries===
When Lycoming County was organized on [[April 13]], [[1795]], the bill passed by the Pennsylvania legislature defined the new county's boundaries thus:

{{cquote|That all that part of [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]] lying northwestward of a line drawn from the [[Mifflin County, Pennsylvania|Mifflin county]] line on the summit of [[Nittany Mountain|Nittany mountain]]; thence running along the top or highest ridge of said mountain, to where '''White Deer Hole creek''' runs through the same; and from thence by a direct line crossing the West Branch of Susquehanna, at the mouth of Black Hole creek to the end of Muncy Hills; thence along the top of Muncy Hills and the Bald Mountain to the [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne county]] line, shall be, and the same is hereby erected into a separate county, to be henceforth called and known by the name of Lycoming County.<ref name="history"/> [emphasis added]}}

The borders of the county have changed considerably since, but the White Deer Hole Creek watershed still approximates the county line in the south. Until 1861, what is now Gregg Township in Union County was a part of Brady Township in Lycoming County. Thus, until the start of the [[American Civil War]], almost all of White Deer Hole Creek and its watershed were part of Lycoming County.<ref name="history"/>

===Early inhabitants===
[[Image:White Deer Hole Creek from Route 15.JPG|thumb|250px|White Deer Hole Creek, very near its mouth and the site of its earliest settlements (looking west from U.S. Route 15 in Gregg Township).]] 

Prior to construction, the site of the wastewater treatment plant yielded archeological evidence of habitation by indigenous peoples from the [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]], [[Archaic period|Archaic]], and [[Woodland period]]s.<ref name="prison"/> The only Native American inhabitant of the valley whose name is known, "Cochnehaw", lived near the mouth of White Deer Hole Creek. White Deer Hole Creek was acquired by the colonial government of Pennsylvania on [[November 5]], [[1768]] as part of the "New Purchase" in the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]]. The first settlers came to the valley in 1769 or 1770, and by 1778 there were 146 landowners on the township tax rolls (though many likely resided elsewhere.)

In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and Native Americans allied with the British. After the [[Wyoming Valley battle and massacre]] in the summer of 1778 (near what is now [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]]) and smaller local attacks, the "[[The Big Runaway|Big Runaway]]" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]]. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the "Little Runaway".<ref name="picture">{{cite book | others = The Lycoming County Unit of the Pennsylvania Writers Project of the [[Work Projects Administration]] | title = A Picture of Lycoming County  | origdate = 1939 | url = http://www.libraries.psu.edu/do/digitalbookshelf/2799521/  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2006-07-23  | edition = First edition  | publisher = The Commissioners of Lycoming County Pennsylvania}}</ref>

[[Sullivan's Expedition]] helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. However, in 1787 there were only fourteen families in the valley: five on the river banks, five on White Deer Hole Creek between Spring Creek and the river, two on Spring Creek, and two on the creek west of Spring Creek. Six families left the area not long after 1787.<ref name="wolfinger"/> The first grist mill was built on the creek in 1789, with four more built in 1798, 1815, 1817, and 1842.<ref name="history"/>

===Lumber and Logging Railroad===
[[Image:White Deer Hole Valley crop.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Farms and woodlands in White Deer Hole Creek valley with the second-growth Tiadaghton State Forest on South White Deer Ridge behind.]]

Beginning with the first settlers, much of the land along White Deer Hole Creek was slowly cleared of timber. Small sawmills were built in the 19th century, and a much larger lumber operation was run by the Vincent Lumber Company from 1901 to 1904. They built a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] {{convert|42|in|mm|0}} railroad from Elimsport {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} west into timber, and a line east to Allenwood and the [[Reading Railroad]] there. The lumber railroad ran parallel to the creek, with the end of the track near the Fourth Gap. It was incorporated on [[June 24]], [[1901]] (around the time of construction) as the "Allenwood and Western Railroad". The lumbering operation ceased in 1904 when the forests were gone. The railroad was torn up, and its one second-hand [[Shay locomotive]] was moved to the Vincent Lumber Company operation at Denholm (in [[Juniata County, Pennsylvania|Juniata County]]).<ref name="taber atlas">{{cite book | author=Taber, Thomas T., III | year=1987 | title=Railroads of Pennsylvania Encyclopedia and Atlas | publisher=Thomas T. Taber III | id=ISBN 0-9603398-5-X}}</ref> 

From 1900 to 1935, much of what is now Tiadaghton State Forest was purchased by Pennsylvania from lumber companies that had no further use for the clear-cut land. In the 1930s there were seven [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camps to construct roads and trails in the forest.<ref name="tiadaghton"/> 

Small-scale lumbering continues in the watershed, but the forest is certified as well-managed "in an environmentally sensitive manner" and lumber from it qualifies for a "green label".<ref name="tiadaghton"/> Gertler reports lumber operations along White Deer Hole Creek near Elimsport in the early 1980s.<ref name="canoe"/> A sawmill owned and operated by Amish is on Route 44 in Elimsport. It burned down on [[May 10]], [[2006]] (causing $500,000 in damages) but was expected to be back in operation in a month.<ref>{{cite news  | first = Philip A. | last = Holmes | title = Fire claims Route 44 sawmill

 | accessdate = 2006-11-20}}</ref> Despite this small-scale lumbering, as of 2006 the forests have grown back and are mixed [[oak]], with [[blueberry]] and [[kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] bushes. White Deer Hole Creek and its tributaries also have stands of [[tsuga|hemlock]] and thickets of [[rhododendron]] along them.<ref name="central"/>

=== Ordnance plant to federal prison and game lands===
During the Second World War, the federal government built the [[United States dollar|US$]]50 million  Susquehanna [[Explosive material|Ordnance]] Depot to make TNT on {{convert|8500|acre|sqkm|1}}, partially in the White Deer Hole Creek watershed. In the spring of 1942, residents were evicted by [[eminent domain]] from 163 farms and 47 other properties in Gregg Township in Union County and Brady, Clinton, and Washington Townships in Lycoming County. The village of Alvira in Gregg Township disappeared.<ref name="oue"/> Alvira was founded in 1825 as "Wisetown" and had 100 inhabitants by 1900. Although the inhabitants were told they could return after the war, almost all the buildings seized were razed. Only some cemeteries and the nearby "Stone Church" remain.<ref name="alvira">{{cite news |first=Lou |last=Hunsinger Jr. |title= Alvira: an explosive ghost town |publisher= [[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]] |date= [[May 14]], [[2000]] |page=B-1 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> Construction of the plant involved some 10,000 people, and it took 3,500 to 4,500 employees to run the plant with its more than 200 buildings and 149 storage bunkers for TNT and high explosives, as well as storage racks of bombs. However, the need for TNT was lower than originally estimated and the project was nearly abandoned. By 1945, the only workers left at the depot were guards.<ref name="bunkers">{{cite news |first=Pamela A. |last=Brenneman |title= State Ordnance Works Bunkers Remain |publisher= [[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]] |date= [[November 2]], [[1997]] |page=B-5 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> 

[[Image:Susquehanna Ordnance Depot Bunker.JPG|thumb|250px|An overgrown bunker from the former Susquehanna Ordnance Depot in State Game Lands 252 about {{convert|0.6|mi|km|0}} from Spring Creek.]]
The depot closed after the war and the land was used by the United States Army for testing.<ref name="alvira"/> In 1950, the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] was given {{convert|4000|acre|sqkm|1}}  of the plant site, and began housing prisoners from the [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary]] there in 1952. In 1957 the "Allenwood Prison Camp" was built, which became the "Federal Correctional Institute, Allenwood". This was greatly expanded in the early 1990s to become "the largest federal prison facility" in the United States. North of the White Deer Hole Creek watershed, some of the land was sold to make the "White Deer Golf Course" in Clinton Township, and in 1973, {{convert|125|acre|sqkm|1}} of prison land in Brady Township were leased to Lycoming County for its landfill (which serves five counties).<ref name="oue"/>

The remaining {{convert|3018|acre|sqkm|1}} were given to Pennsylvania and became State Game Lands 252.<ref name=game lands"/> Many of the 149 concrete bunkers remain,<ref name="bunkers"/> but it is "a diverse mix of mature forest, impoundments, and brushy thickets, as well as a local hotspot for a variety of birds during migration". The watershed is a haven for wildlife. As of 2004, common animals in the game lands include [[painted turtle|Painted]] and [[Snapping Turtle]]s, [[Muskrat]]s, [[Frog]]s, [[Eastern Cottontail]], [[Red Fox]], and White-tailed Deer, while birds include [[Golden-winged Warbler|Golden-winged]], [[Hooded Warbler|Hooded]], and [[Blue-winged Warbler]]s, [[Red-shouldered Hawk]], [[Wood Duck]], [[Bewick's Swan|Tundra Swan]], [[Pied-billed Grebe]], [[American Bittern]], [[Heron]]s, and [[Belted Kingfisher]].<ref name="audubon">{{cite book |last= Audubon Pennsylvania|authorlink= National Audubon Society|coauthors= Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |title= Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail |origdate= 2004|url=
