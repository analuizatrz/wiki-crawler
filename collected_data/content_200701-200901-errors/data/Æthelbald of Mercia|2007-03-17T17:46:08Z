'''Ethelbald''' (or '''Æthelbald''') (died [[757]]) was the [[List of monarchs of Mercia|King]] of [[Mercia]] in [[England]] from [[716]] until his death. He was the son of Alweo and was a grandson of [[Eowa of Mercia|Eowa]], brother of [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]].

Ethelbald spent his early years exiled from Mercia, according to the ''Life'' of [[Guthlac|Guthlac of Crowland]], who often provided him and his followers shelter. On [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]]'s death, he returned to become king in [[716]].

Ethelbald was largely successful in his efforts to impose Mercian authority over southern England, and in doing so his reign foreshadowed that of [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]]. During the early part of his reign, the rival kingdom of [[Wessex]] remained formidable, but this changed following the abdication of [[Ine of Wessex]] in [[726]]. A succession dispute among the West Saxons followed, and the successful claimant to the throne, [[Aethelheard of Wessex|Aethelheard]], seems to have subsequently ruled subject to Mercian authority. This may indicate that his claim to the throne had been supported by Ethelbald. There was nevertheless some cause for conflict between the two kings, however, since in [[733]] Ethelbald undertook an expedition against Wessex and captured the royal [[Manorialism|manor]] of [[Somerton]].

In the north, Ethelbald took advantage of the absence of [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht]] in a campaign against the [[Picts]] in [[740]] to invade [[Northumbria]] and burn [[York]]. Ethelbald was also at war with the [[Wales|Welsh]] throughout his reign. In [[722]], a Mercian defeat at the hands of the Welsh was recorded, probably against [[Ithel ap Morgan of Glywysing|Ithel ap Morgan]] of [[Glywysing]]. In [[743]], Ethelbald and Aethelheard's successor in Wessex, [[Cuthred of Wessex|Cuthred]], campaigned against the Welsh together. Cuthred was determined to overthrow Mercia's domination of Wessex, however, and in [[752]] he defeated Ethelbald at [[Battle Edge]] in [[Burford|Beorhford]]. This gained Wessex a few years of independence, but Ethelbald seems to have reasserted his authority over the West Saxons by the time of his death, since a later West Saxon king, [[Cynewulf of Wessex|Cynewulf]], is recorded as witnessing a charter of Ethelbald at the very beginning of his reign, in 757.

We may gather something of Ethelbald's character and policies from a letter sent to him by [[Saint Boniface]], bishop of [[Mainz]], in either [[746]] or [[747]]. In it, Boniface reproached Ethelbald for his behavior towards [[Roman Catholic Church|church]] property, towards [[nun]]s, and concerning the example he set for his subjects. It was perhaps in response to these admonitions that, in a charter of [[749]], Ethelbald freed [[ecclesiastical]] lands from all obligations except the ''[[trinoda necessitas]]''.

In [[757]], he was slain by his bodyguard at [[Seckington]], [[Warwickshire]], near the royal seat of [[Tamworth]]. His death may have been due to a [[feud]], or it may have been the work of his short-lived successor, [[Beornrad of Mercia|Beornrad]]. Ethelbald was buried at [[Repton]].
