'''''Coronation Street''''' is an award-winning [[United Kingdom|British]] soap opera. It is the longest-running television [[soap opera]] in the [[United Kingdom]], first broadcast on Friday, [[9 December]], [[1960]] in the [[Granada Television|Granada]] region of [[ITV]]. The programme is consistently the highest-rated programme on [[British television]].<ref>{{cite web |first = Broadcasters' Audience Research Board LTD |title = Terrestrial Top 30 |url = http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=weeklyterrestrial&requesttimeout=500&flag=viewingsummary|format = Website |work = Barb.co.uk |accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref>

The show was created by [[Tony Warren]] and is produced by Granada Television (now branded [[Granada Productions|ITV Productions]]), holder of the [[ITV#Organisation|ITV franchise]] for the northwest of England, and was shown by most of the ITV stations then operating (See Scheduling details below). It became fully networked on [[6 March]] [[1961]], when [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]], the only remaining franchise, began airing it.<ref>Kershaw. p.30.</ref><ref name="littlepg10">Little. (2000) p.10. Note: both Kershaw and Little make errors in relating the early transmission of the programme. The information here is taken from broadcast details in contemporary editions of ''The Times'' and ''TV Times''.</ref>

''Coronation Street'' (commonly nicknamed and written as ''Corrie'' or ''the Street'') is set in a fictional street in [[Weatherfield]], a fictional town in [[Greater Manchester]] based loosely on [[Salford]]. The programme focuses on the experiences and driving forces behind the residents of Coronation Street, and examines families and individuals within the community who are of different ages, classes, and social structures.<ref name="littlepg8">Little. (1995) p.8.</ref>

Coronation Street itself consists of a row of seven early 20th century [[terraced house]]s on its northern side with a [[public house]], the [[Rovers Return Inn]], at one end, and a [[General store|corner shop]] at the other. The southern side of the street consists of a factory, two shop units, a garage and three houses, all constructed in the late 1980s. The programme also incorporates the residents of neighbouring streets, including Rosamund Street, Victoria Street, and Viaduct Street.<ref>{{cite web |first = Coronation Street Official Website |title = Street Map |url = http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=5221|format = Website |work = itv.com |accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref>

The working title of the show was ''Florizel Street'', but a [[tea lady]] named Agnes remarked that "Florizel" sounded like a brand of disinfectant so the name was changed.<ref>Warren, Tony ''40 Years On Coronation Street: Celebration Special''. [[London Weekend Television]], 2000.</ref>  The choice of new name was between ''Jubilee Street'' and ''Coronation Street'', with Granada executives Harry Latham, Harry Elton and [[H V Kershaw|H.V. Kershaw]] deciding on the latter.<ref>Kershaw. p.22-24.</ref>

As of 2007, ''Coronation Street'' is broadcast in the United Kingdom at 19.30 and 20.30 Monday, and at 19.30 Wednesday, Friday and Sunday on terrestrial network [[ITV]]. In [[Republic of Ireland|the Republic of Ireland]], ''Coronation Street'' is [[simulcast]] on [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]]. Repeat episodes and specials can be seen on ITV's main digital channel, [[ITV2]], with an [[Omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] edition shown on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. However, sometimes due to sporting events such as football, Formula 1 and rugby, it has sometimes had to either alter its air time or not air at all.

Since its launch the programme has aired in many countries worldwide including [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]] and The [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web |first = Glenda |last = Young |title = Coronation Street overseas |url = http://www.corrie.net/start/faq.html#watch |format = Website |work = Corrie.net |accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref>

==Characters and characterisations==
{{see also|List of characters from Coronation Street}}

Since 1960, ''Coronation Street'' has featured many characters, whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed. The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Patricia Phoenix]]) and [[Annie Walker]] ([[Doris Speed]]) as central figures.<ref>Little. (1995) p.7.</ref> These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became [[archetype]]s of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials, with Ena as the street's [[busybody]], battleaxe and self-proclaimed moral voice;<ref>Tinker. p.38.</ref> Elsie as the [[Hooker with a heart of gold|tart with a heart]], who was constantly hurt by men in the search for true love;<ref>Tinker. p.57.</ref> and Annie Walker, landlady of the [[Rovers Return Inn]], who had [[delusions of grandeur]] and saw herself as better than other residents of Coronation Street.<ref>Tinker. p.40.</ref>

For a number of years, ''Coronation Street'' became known for the portrayal of strong female characters,<ref>Geraghty, Christine. ''Women and Soap Opera'', Polity Press, London, 1991. (ISBN 0-7456-0568-0)</ref> with characters like Ena Sharples, Annie Walker, Elsie Tanner and [[Hilda Ogden]] becoming household names during the 1960s.<ref>Little. (2000) p.5.</ref>  Tony Warren created a programme that was largely matrifocal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up.<ref>{{cite web |first = Will |last = Hadcroft |title = Daran Little interview |url = http://www.corrie.net/profiles/interviews/little.html |format = Website |work = Corrie.net |accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref>. As a consequence, the show also has a long tradition of [[hen-pecked]] husbands, most famously [[Stan Ogden]] and [[Jack Duckworth]], husbands of Hilda and Vera respectively.

Of the characters in the original episodes, only one remains: [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]). Barlow entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], and the model [[Twiggy]] were to reshape the concept of youthful rebellion. Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off, Ken has remained the constant link throughout 46 years of ''Coronation Street''.

1964 saw the introduction of [[Stan Ogden|Stan]] and Hilda Ogden, with Hilda ([[Jean Alexander]]) becoming one of the most famous British soap characters of all time. In a 1982 poll, Hilda was voted the fourth most recognizable woman in Britain, after [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother]], [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].<ref>Little. (1995) p.188.</ref>  Hilda's best-known attributes were her [[Pinafore|pinny]], hair curlers, and the [[mural|"muriel"]] in her [[living room]] with three "flying" duck ornaments. Hilda Ogden's final episode on [[25 December]] [[1987]], remains the highest-rated episode of ''Coronation Street'' ever, with nearly 27 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news  |first = Dennis |last = Barker |title = Obituary: Leslie Duxbury |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1635800,00.html |format = Website edition |work = The Guardian |date = [[November 7]], [[2005]] |accessdate = 2006-09-02}}</ref>

Bet Lynch ([[Julie Goodyear]]) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970, and would go on to become one of the most famous ''Corrie'' characters.<ref>Little. (2000) p.66.</ref> Bet stood as the central character of the show from 1987 until departing in 1995, often being dubbed as "Queen of the Street" by the media, and indeed herself.<ref>{{cite web  |title = Queen Of The Street The Amazing Life Of Julie Goodyear |url =http://www.alkenmrs.com/soapsrus/coronationstreet/csqueenstreet.html.|format = Website |work = Alken M.R.S |accessdate = 2007-03-09}}</ref>

''Coronation Street'' and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some its current cast based loosely on past characters. [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) embodies the role of the acid-tongued busybody, which was originally held by Ena Sharples. [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Whittaker]]) has grown snobbish, like Annie Walker, while a number of the programme's female characters mirror the vulnerability of Elsie Tanner and Bet Lynch. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran ([[Albert Tatlock]], [[Percy Sugden]]), the bumbling retail manager ([[Leonard Swindley]], Reg Holdsworth, 'Chuck' [[Norris Cole]]), and the perennial losers (Stan and Hilda Ogden, [[Jack Duckworth|Jack]] and [[Vera Duckworth]], and [[Les Battersby-Brown]]).<ref>{{cite video | people = David Liddiment  | title =How Soaps Changed the World | medium = Television Documentary | publisher = [[Channel 4]] UK | location = UK | date = [[July 17]], [[2004]] }}</ref>

==History==
===1960s===
[[Image:Ken barlow.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Ken Barlow]] in the first episode of ''Coronation Street''.]]

The serial began on [[9 December]] [[1960]] and was not initially a critical success. Granada Television commissioned only 13 episodes and some inside the company doubted the show would last its planned production run.<ref>Little. (1995) p.10.</ref> Despite the negativity, viewers were immediately drawn to the serial, won over by ''Coronation Street'''s 'ordinary' characters.<ref>Little. (1995) p.26.</ref> The programme also made use of [[Northern English]] language and [[dialect]]; affectionate local terms like "eh, chuck?", "nowt" and "by heck!" became widely heard on British television for the first time.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Miller |editor=Graham Nown |title=Street Talk: The Language of Coronation Street |publisher=Ward Lock |year=1986 |location=London|isbn= 0-7063-6514-3}}</ref>

Early episodes told the story of student Kenneth Barlow, who had won a place at university and thus found his background something of an embarrassment.<ref>TV Times. (1960) p.8.</ref> The character is one of the few to have experienced life 'outside' of ''Coronation Street'', and in some ways predicts the growth of [[globalization|globalisation]] and the decline of similar communities. In a 1961 episode, Barlow declares: "You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than Elsie Tanner and her boyfriends."<ref>{{cite video | people = Granada Television | title =Coronation Street 1961 | medium = Television serial drama  | publisher = Granada | location =Quay Street, Manchester | date =November 8, 1961 }}</ref>
 
[[Image:Ena and Elsie 1965.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Ena Sharples and Elsie Tanner argue in a 1965 episode of ''Coronation Street''.]]

Also at the centre of many early stories was Ena Sharples, caretaker of the [[Mission (station)|Glad Tidings Mission Hall]], and her friends: timid [[Minnie Caldwell]] ([[Margot Bryant]]) and bespectacled [[Martha Longhurst]] ([[Lynne Carol]]). The trio were likened to the [[Greek chorus]], and the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', as they would sit in the snug bar of the Rovers Return, passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.<ref>Tinker. p.31.</ref>  Headstrong Ena often clashed with Elsie Tanner, whom she believed espoused a rather disgusting set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which, most of the time, had little basis in reality.

In September 1961, ''Coronation Street'' reached No.1 in the [[television ratings]] and remained there for the rest of the year.<ref name="littlepg10"/> Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15 million) tuned into ''Corrie'' and by 1964 the programme had over 20 million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on [[December 2]], [[1964]], at 21.36 million viewers.<ref>Little. (1995) p.35.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BFI Most Watched 1960s|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html|accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref>

Storylines throughout the decade included: a mystery poison-pen letter received by Elsie Tanner, the 1962 marriage of Ken Barlow and [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie Tatlock]], [[Storylines of Coronation Street#Killing of Martha Longhurst|the death of Martha Longhurst]] in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner's wedding to Steve Tanner as well as a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), the murder of Steve Tanner in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.
 
In spite of rising popularity with viewers, ''Coronation Street'' was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban [[working-class]], and its representation of a community that was a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert C| last=Allen|title=Soap Opera|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref>  After the first episode in 1960, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' printed: "The programme is doomed from the outset... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week."<ref>Tinker. p.12-3</ref>  By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the ''1950s''. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including drugs, sex, homosexuality and out of wedlock pregnancy, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.<ref>Little. (2000) p.45</ref>

===1970s===
[[Image:Valerie Barlow 1971 death.jpg|rightt|thumb|200px|Val Barlow in her final scene mending the plug of a hairdryer before she was electrocuted.]]
The show's [[production team]] was tested when many core cast members left the programme in the early 1970s. When Arthur Leslie died suddenly in 1970, his character, Rovers landlord Jack Walker, died with him.<ref>Little. (2000) p.67.</ref>  [[Anne Reid]] quit as Valerie Barlow, and was killed off in 1971, electrocuting herself with a faulty hairdryer.<ref name="littlepg73"/> Ratings reached a low of 8 million in February 1973, Pat Phoenix quit as Elsie Tanner, Violet Carson (Ena Sharples) was written out for most of the year due to illness, and Doris Speed (Annie Walker) took two months’ leave.<ref name="littlepg86">Little. (2000) p.86.</ref> ITV daytime soap ''[[Crossroads (TV series)|Crossroads]]'' saw a marked increase in viewers at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson ([[Noele Gordon]]), grew in popularity.<ref name="littlepg86"/> These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of Bet Lynch, [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) and [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973 with characters such as [[Gail Platt|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]] and [[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974. These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years.<ref>Little. (2000) p.79.</ref><ref>Little. (2000) p.93.</ref>

The 1970s was also the decade when ''Coronation Street'' began to include more comedy in its storylines, at the insistence of new producer [[Bill Podmore]] who joined in 1976, having worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.<ref>Little. (2000) p.107.</ref> Stan and Hilda Ogden were often at the centre of overtly funny story lines, with other comic characters including [[Eddie Yeats]] ([[Geoffrey Hughes]]), [[Fred Gee]] ([[Fred Feast]]) and [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[William Tarmey]]) all making their first appearances during the decade.
[[Image:1979 Tilsley wedding.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Brian Tilsley marries Gail Potter in a 1979 episode of ''Coronation Street''.]]
In 1976, Pat Phoenix returned to her role as Elsie Tanner and, after a spate of ill health, Violet Carson returned as Ena.<ref>Little. (1995) p.131.</ref> ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and [[Suzie Birchall]] moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff Bet Lynch, [[Betty Driver|Betty Turpin]] and Fred Gee.

Storylines throughout the decade included: a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]] in 1977, the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of [[Brian Tilsley]] and Gail Potter (also in 1979).

''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially-viable story lines and again presenting a dated view of working-class life.<ref>Liddement. (2004)</ref>

===1980s===
Between 1980 and 1989, ''Coronation Street'' underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, Ken Barlow stood as the only original [[cast member]], after the departures of Ena Sharples (in 1980), Annie Walker (in 1983), Elsie Tanner (in 1984) and [[Albert Tatlock]] (also 1984).<ref>Little. (2000) p.134. and p.153-159.</ref> In 1983, [[antihero]] [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson]]), one of the show's central male characters since 1961, was killed off, and in 1984, [[Bernard Youens]] (Stan Ogden) died.<ref>Little. (2000) p.153-159.</ref> While the press predicted the end of ''Corrie'', H.V. Kershaw reminded viewers that "There are no stars in ''Coronation Street''."<ref>Tinker. p.62.</ref>  Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with previously established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast.<ref name="little172">Little. (1995) p.172.</ref> [[Phyllis Pearce]] (Jill Summers) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens, while Percy Sugden ([[Bill Waddington]]) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock.<ref>Little. (1995) p.162.</ref><ref>Little. (1995) p.171.</ref> The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, Shirley Armitage became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.<ref name="little172"/>

[[Image:Ken and Deirdre 1983.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ken and Deirdre Barlow row after the revelation of Deirdre's affair with [[Mike Baldwin]] in a 1983 episode of ''Coronation Street''.]]

Ken Barlow married Deirdre Langton on [[27 July]] [[1981]]. The episode was watched by over 24 million viewers - more ITV viewers than the wedding of [[Prince Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] two days later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Icons - a portrait of England|work=icons.org.uk |url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/the-archers/features/soaps-a-history|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>  The 1980s also saw the cementing of relationships between established characters: [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]) married [[Audrey Roberts|Audrey Potter]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) in 1985, [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) married [[Sally Webster|Sally Seddon]] ([[Sally Whittaker]]) in 1986.<ref>Little. (1995) p.174, p.182-183.</ref> Bet Lynch married [[Alec Gilroy]] in 1987 and the marriages of Ivy Tilsley and [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street character)|Don Brennan]], and [[Derek Wilton]] and Mavis Riley took place in 1988.<ref>Little. (1995) p.184, p.189.</ref>

The arrival of [[Channel 4]] and its edgy new serial ''[[Brookside]]'' in 1982 was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street'', as well as the [[BBC]]'s new prime time soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.<ref>Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> While ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''EastEnders'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures.<ref>Little. (2000) p.170.</ref>  With prime time competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being failure with viewers.<ref name="littlepg165">Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer, David Liddiment. A new exterior set had been built in 1982 and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed, with a new studio being built and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved from being shot on [[film]] to [[videotape]] in 1988.<ref name="littlepg188">Little. (2000) p.188.</ref>  New pressures also saw introduction of the third weekly episode on [[20 October]] [[1989]], broadcast each Friday at 19:30.<ref name="littlepg188"/>

The 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as [[Deirdre Barlow]]'s affair with Mike Baldwin in 1983, the first soap story line to receive widespread media attention.<ref>Little. (1995) p.165.</ref>  The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, Susan. In 1986 there was a fire at the Rovers Return, and between 1986 and 1989, the story of [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]]'s [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of [[Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), and his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]], was played out. The show's highest rated episode (26.6 million viewers) came in 1987, when Hilda Ogden left the show. Other stories included: the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and Stan Ogden's funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] in 1987, and Brian Tilsley's murder in 1989.

New characters were introduced, such as Kevin and Sally Webster, [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]), [[Martin Platt]] ([[Sean Wilson]]), Reg Holdsworth ([[Ken Morley]]) and the McDonald family.

===1990s===
In spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low-representation of [[Minority group|ethnic minorities]] and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as '''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks' (''[[The Times]]'') and 'Put colour in t'Street' (''Daily Mirror'').<ref>Little. (1995) p.217.</ref>   Patrick Stoddart of ''The Times'' wrote: "The millions who watch ''Coronation Street'' – and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg – know real life when they see it […] in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen".<ref>Little. (2000) p.205.</ref> Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it wasn't until 1999 that show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family.

New characters [[Des Barnes|Des]] and Steph Barnes moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as '[[Yuppie]]s'.<ref>Little. (2000) p.194.</ref> [[Raquel Watts|Raquel Wolstenhulme]] ([[Sarah Lancashire]]) first appeared in 1991 and went on to become one of the most popular characters. The McDonald family were developed and the fiery relationships between [[Liz McDonald|Liz]], [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim]], [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve]] and [[Andy McDonald (Coronation Street)|Andy]] interested viewers.<ref>Little. (2000) p.199.</ref><ref>Little. (1995) p.211.</ref> Other newcomers were [[Maud Grimes]] ([[Elizabeth Bradley]]), [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]), Judy and Gary Mallett, [[Fred Elliott|Fred Elliot]] ([[John Savident]]) and [[Ashley Peacock]] ([[Steven Arnold]]). The amount of [[slapstick]] and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comic characters such as Reg Holdsworth and his water bed.<ref>Little. (1995) p.220.</ref> 

Storylines in the early part of the decade included: the death of newborn Katie McDonald in 1992, Mike Baldwin's wedding to Alma Sedgewick ([[Amanda Barrie]]) in 1992, Tommy Duckworth being sold by his father Terry in 1993, Deirdre Barlow's marriage to Moroccan Samir Rachid, and the rise of [[Tanya Pooley]] ([[Eva Pope]]) between 1993 and 1994.
[[Image:deirdresentdown.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Deirdre Rachid being jailed in a 1998 episode of ''Coronation Street''.]]
In 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day he axed the characters of [[Derek Wilton]], [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street Character)|Don Brennan]], [[Percy Sugden]], [[Bill Webster]], Billy Williams and [[Maureen Holdsworth]].<ref name="littlepg235">Little. (2000) p.235.</ref> [[Thelma Barlow]], who played Derek's wife Mavis, was angered by the sacking of her co-star and resigned, while the production team also lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned.<ref name="littlepg235"/>

In line with Park's suggestion, younger characters were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by [[Adam Rickitt]], [[Single parent|single mother]] Zoe Tattersall first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealers]], eco-warriors, religious cults and a transsexual.<ref name="little241">Little. (2000) p.241.</ref> Park quit in 1998, after deciding that he had done what he intended to do; he maintained that his biggest achievement was the introduction of [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley Patterson]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]), the first [[transsexual]] character in a British soap.<ref name="little241"/>

Viewers were alienated by the new-look ''Coronation Street'', and the media voiced disapproval. Having received criticism of being too out of touch, ''Corrie'' now struggled to emulate the more modern ''Brookside'' and ''EastEnders''. In the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] wrote: "Apparently it doesn't matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company."<ref name="littlepg235"/>

One of ''Coronation Street'''s best known storylines took place in 1998, with [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Rachid]] being wrongfully imprisoned after a relationship with con-man Jon Lindsay. 19 million viewers watched Deirdre being sent to prison, and 'Free the Weatherfield One' campaigns sprung up in a media frenzy.<ref name="little241"/>  [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] even passed comment on Deirdre’s sentencing in Parliament.<ref>{{cite news|title=PM supports Weatherfield One|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/71934.stm|date=March 31, 1998|accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref> Deirdre was freed after three weeks, with Granada stating that they had always intended for her to be released, in spite of the media interest.<ref name="little241"/>

===2000s===
On [[8 December]] [[2000]], the show celebrated its fortieth year by broadcasting a live, hour-long, episode. [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] made a cameo in the episode, appearing in a pre-recorded segment as himself in an [[ITV News]] bulletin report, presented by [[Sir Trevor McDonald|Trevor McDonald]].<ref name="prince">{{cite news | work=bbc.co.uk | title= Prince stars in live soap |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1061585.stm| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>  Earlier in the year, 13-year old [[Sarah-Louise Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]) had fallen pregnant and gave birth to a baby girl, [[Bethany Platt|Bethany]], on [[4 June]]. The episode where [[Gail Platt|Gail]] was told of her daughter's pregnancy being watched by 15 million viewers.<ref name="littlepg256">Little. (2000) p.256.</ref> The year also saw the programme's first [[two-hander]], between Curly and Raquel Watts.<ref name="littlepg256"/>

From 1999-2001, Jane MacNaught was ''Coronation Street's'' executive producer, and received harsh criticism from both viewers and critics. In an attempt to compete with ''EastEnders'', issue-led story lines were introduced such as [[Toyah Battersby]]'s rape, Roy and Hayley Cropper abducting their [[Foster care|foster child]], Sarah Platt's [[Chat room|Internet chat room]] abduction and [[Alma Baldwin|Alma Halliwell]]'s death of [[cervical cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Jane|last=McNaught|title=Coronation Street Producer|publisher= Corrie.net |url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/producers.html|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> Such storylines were unpopular with viewers and ratings dropped and in October 2001, Macnaught was abruptly moved to another Granada department and Carolyn Reynolds took over. ''Corrie'' continued to struggle in the ratings, with ''EastEnders'' introducing some of its strongest stories. In 2002, Kieran Roberts was appointed as producer and aimed to re-introduce "gentle story lines and humour", after deciding that ''the Street'' shouldn't try and compete with other soaps.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kieran|last=Roberts|title=Coronation Street Producer|publisher= Corrie.net|url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/producers.html|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

In 2002, one of ''Coronation Street's'' best-known storylines began, which culminated in 2003. Gail Platt married [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]), a [[Financial adviser|financial advisor]], who would go on to leave [[Duggie Ferguson]] to die, murder his ex-wife Patricia, attempt to murder his [[mother-in-law]], Audrey Roberts, murder [[Maxine Peacock]] and attempt to murder [[Emily Bishop]]. After confessing to the murder of Maxine and his ex-wife, Hillman attempted to kill Gail, her children Sarah and [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David]], and her grand-daughter Bethany, by driving them into a canal. The storyline received wide press attention, and viewing figures peaked at 19.4 million, with Hillman dubbed a "serial killer" by the media.<ref>{{cite news|title=Street drama hits ratings high|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2796201.stm |date=25 February, 2003 |accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref>  

[[Todd Grimshaw]] began to question his sexuality in 2003, becoming ''Corrie's'' first regular homosexual character, after years of criticism about non-representation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Street gay kiss complaints rejected |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3238111.stm|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> The character of [[Karen McDonald]] ([[Suranne Jones]]) was developed, with her fiery marriage to Steve and warring with [[Tracy Barlow]]. Tracy would go on to receive a life sentence in March 2007 for murdering lover Charlie Stubbs.

In 2004, ''Coronation Street'' [[retconned]] the Baldwin family when Mike's nephew [[Danny Baldwin]] and his wife Frankie moved to the area from Essex, with their two sons Jamie and Warren. Until this time, Mike Baldwin had been portrayed as an [[only child]], with his father appearing in the programme between 1980 and 1982 confirming the fact.

Between 2000 and 2007, a range of other storylines featured, such as the [[bigamy]] of [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]], [[Maya Sharma]]'s revenge on former lover [[Dev Alahan]], [[Katy Harris]] murdering her father and subsequently committing suicide, Charlie Stubbs's psychological abuse of [[Shelley Unwin]] and the deaths of [[Mike Baldwin]] and [[Fred Elliott]], Two new families were also introduced into the show, The Connors and The Mortons, The Mortons where not as popular as the Connors when introduced [http://shinymedia.headshift.com/corrieblog/2007/04/wednesday_yay_o_5.html], but soon settled in as regulars.

In 2007, several groundbreaking storylines took place on Coronation Street, such as [[Leanne Battersby]] becoming a [[prostitute]] and the first bi-sexual love triangle, The Connors were central to most storylines at the beginning of 2007, an accidental death at Underworld, due to overworking, [[Michelle Connor]] finding out her brothers [[Paul Connor|Paul]] and [[Liam Connor|Liam]] were the cause of her husband's death, Paul Connor using an escort service and his kidnapping of Leanne and subsequent death. Many big names have left or are due to leave in 2007 and untill Spring 2008, including Charlie Stubbs, Tracy Barlow and Vera Duckworth

==Production==
===Broadcast format===
Between [[9 December]] [[1960]] and [[3 March]] [[1961]], ''Coronation Street'' was broadcast twice weekly, on Wednesday and Friday.<ref>Little (2000) p.10.</ref>  During this period, the Friday episode was broadcast live, with the Wednesday episode being pre-recorded 15 minutes later.<ref>Kershaw. p.30.</ref>  When the programme went fully networked on [[6 March]] [[1961]], broadcast days changed to Monday and Wednesday.<ref name="littlepg10">Little. (2000) p.10.</ref>  The last regular episode to be shown live aired on [[3 February]] [[1961]]. 

Transmitted in black and white for the majority of the 1960s, preparations were made to film episode 923 (transmitted Wednesday [[October 29]] [[1969]]), which featured the street residents on a coach trip to the Lake District, in colour. In the event, suitable colour stock for the film cameras could not be found and the episode was made in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday [[November 3]], was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like [[BBC1]], the ITV network was broadcast in black and white at this point so viewers noticed nothing unusual. The reasons why episodes were made in colour for monochrome transmission are not stated in any literature but it is possible that it was for the purposes of testing the look of sets and costumes using the new cameras. Certainly one set (that of the Rovers Return) undergoes a subtle change of colours in November 1969 without any on-screen explanation.

Daran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on Monday [[November 24]], [[1969]]<ref>Little pg58"</ref> however the ITV network, like [[BBC1]], began full colour transmissions on Saturday [[November 15]], [[1969]] and it is therefore possible that the first transmitted colour episode is number 928 shown on Monday [[November 17]]. In October 1970 a long-simmering technician's dispute turned into a [[work-to-rule]] when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment. The terms of the work to rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment and therefore programmes had to be recorded and transmitted in black and white, including ''Coronation Street''<ref>Richard Marson. "Inside Updown - the story of "Upstairs Downstairs". Kaleidoscope publishing 2001. p50.</ref> The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode aired on [[8 February]] [[1971]].

===Production staff===
''Coronation Street's'' creator, Tony Warren wrote the first 13 episodes of the programme in 1960, and continued to write for the programme intermittently until 1976.<ref name="top10writers">{{cite web|title=Coronation Street's top ten writers|work=corrie.net|url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/writers.html|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  He still retains links with ''Coronation Street'', often advising on storylines. 

[[H V Kershaw]] (''Harry Kershaw'')<ref>{{cite web|title=H V Kershaw|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449958/|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> was the script editor for ''Coronation Street'' when the programme began in 1960, working alongside Tony Warren. Kershaw was also a script writer for the programme and the show's producer between 1962 and 1971. He remains the only person, along with John Finch, to have held the three posts of script editor, writer and producer. Kershaw continued to write for the programme until his retirement in January 1988.

[[Adele Rose]] was the longest-serving ''Coronation Street'' [[writer]], completing 455 scripts between [[1961]] and [[1998]]. She went on to create ''[[Byker Grove]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adele Rose|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741220/|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>

[[Bill Podmore]] was the show's longest serving producer. By the time he stepped down in [[1988]] he had completed 13 years at the production helm. Nicknamed the "godfather" by the tabloid press,<ref>Podmore. p.33.</ref> he was renowned for his tough, uncompromising style and was feared by both crew and cast alike. He is probably most famous for sacking [[Peter Adamson]], the show's Len Fairclough, in [[1983]].

[[Michael Apted]], best known for the ''[[Seven Up!|Up!]]'' series of documentaries was a director on the programme in the early 1960s. This period of his career marked the first of his many collaborations with writer [[Jack Rosenthal]]. Rosenthal, noted for such television plays as ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'', began his career on the show, writing over 150 episodes between 1961 and 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack Rosenthal|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742768/#writer1960|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> [[Paul Abbott]] was a story editor on the programme in the 1980s and began writing episodes in 1989, but left in [[1993]] to produce ''[[Cracker (British television)|Cracker]]'', for which he later wrote, before creating his own highly-acclaimed dramas such as ''[[Touching Evil]]'' and ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Abbott|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0008036/|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> [[Russell T.

The current Executive Producer is Kieran Roberts with Steve Frost as Producer. Both have been producers on "Emmerdale" previously.

===Theme music===
The show's [[theme music]], a solo [[cornet]] piece, with [[clarinet]] and [[double bass]] accompaniment, reminiscent of northern band music, was written by [[Eric Spear]] and has been only slightly modified since its debut.<ref>Kershaw. p.25.</ref>

The theme music was also performed on television by the TV entertainer [[Roy Castle]].

===Sets===
{{main|Coronation Street sets}}
[[Image:Rosamund Street Viaduct 2002.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Rosamund Street viaduct as seen in opening credits of ''Coronation Street''.]]
As befitting the soap-opera genre, ''Coronation Street'' is made up of individual housing units, plus communal areas: a newsagent's (''[[The Kabin]]''), a small café (''Roy's Rolls''), a general grocery shop (''D&S Alahan's''), a factory (''[[Underworld (Knickers)|Underworld]]'') and a public house, the ''Rovers Return Inn'', which is the main meeting place for characters on the programme.<ref name="littlepg73">Little. (2000) p.73.</ref>

From 1960–1968, all interactions on the 'outside' street were filmed on a sound stage, with the houses reduced in scale by 3/4 and constructed from wood.<ref name="tinkerpg95">Tinker. p.95.</ref> In 1968, Granada built an outside set which was not all that different from the interior version previously used, with the wooden façades from the studio simply being erected on the new site.<ref name="tinkerpg95"/>

In 1982, a full-size exterior street was built in the Granada [[backlot]], constructed from reclaimed [[Salford]] brick.<ref name="tinkerpg95"/> The set was updated in 1989, with the construction of a new factory, two shop units and three modern [[semi-detached]] houses on the south side of ''Coronation Street''.<ref>Little. (1995) p.194-195.</ref>

Between 1989 and 1999, the [[Granada Studios Tour]] allowed members of the public the opportunity to visit the set. The exterior set was extended and updated in 1999, to include [[Rosamund Street]], Victoria Street and a new viaduct on Rosamund Street. The majority of interior scenes are shot in the adjoining purpose-built studio.<ref>Little. (1995) p.194-195.</ref>

In August 2007, four Urban Explorers evaded security and photographed themselves on set. [http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=19370]

==Scheduling==
===United Kingdom===
For 47 years, ''Coronation Street'' has remained at the centre of ITV's prime time schedule. The programme is currently shown in five episodes, over four evenings a week on the ITV Network.

From Friday [[9 December]] [[1960]] until Friday [[3 March]] [[1961]], the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Wednesday and Friday at 19.00.<ref name="littlepg10"/>  Schedules were changed and from Monday [[6 March]] [[1961]] until Wednesday [[18 October]] [[1989]], the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Monday and Wednesday at 19.30.<ref name="littlepg10"/>  The third weekly episode was introduced on Friday [[20 October]] [[1989]], broadcast at 19.30.<ref>Little. (2000) p.188.</ref>  Aside from Granada, the programme appeared on the following stations of the ITV network:

* [[Associated Rediffusion]]
* [[Scottish Television]]
* [[Television Wales and the West|TWW]]
* [[Southern Television]]
* [[Ulster Television]]
* [[Anglia Television]]

From Episode 14 on Wednesday [[January 25]], [[1961]], [[Tyne Tees Television]] broadcast the programme. That left [[Associated Television|ATV]] in the midlands. When they decided to carry the programme, transmission was changed from Wednesday and Friday to Monday and Wednesday at 19.30 and the programme became fully networked under this new arrangement from Episode 25 on Monday [[March 6]], [[1961]].

As the ITV network grew over the next few years, the programme was transmitted by these new stations on these dates onward:

* [[Westward Television]] from Episode 40 on [[April 29]], [[1961]]
* [[Border Television]] from Episode 76 on [[September 1]], [[1961]]
* [[Grampian Television]] from Episode 84 on [[September 30]], [[1961]]
* [[Channel Television]] from Episode 180 on [[September 1]], [[1962]]
* [[Wales West and North Television]] from Episode 184 on [[September 14]], [[1962]]

At this point, the ITV network became complete and the programme was broadcast almost continuously across the country at 19.30 on Monday and Wednesday for the next twenty-seven years.

From Episode 2981 on Friday [[October 20]] [[1989]] at 19:30, a third weekly episode was introduced and this increased to four episodes a week from Episode 4096 on Sunday [[November 24]] [[1996]], again at 19:30.<ref>Little. (2000) p.229.</ref>  The second Monday episode was introduced in 2002 and was broadcast at 20:30 to usher in the return of [[Bet Lynch]].<ref>{{cite news  |first= Chris| Last= Diamond |title= Coronation Street Review|url = http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2002/coronationstreet.htm|format= Website edition |work= Off The Telly|date= [[June 10]], [[2002]] |accessdate = 2007-03-09}}</ref>  The Monday 20:30 episode was used intermittently during the popular Richard Hillman story line but has become fully-scheduled since Episode 5568 on Monday [[August 25]], [[2003]]. Additional episodes have been aired during the weekly schedule of ITV at certain times, notably in 2004 when, between [[22 November]] and [[26 November]], eight episodes were shown.<ref>{{cite news  |first= Neil| Last= Wilkes |title= Corrie to air eight times in one week|url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a16769/corrie-to-air-eight-times-in-one-week.html |format= Website edition |work= Digital Spy|date= [[November 5]], [[2004]] |accessdate = 2007-03-09}}</ref>

Older episodes had been broadcast by satellite and cable channel [[Granada Plus]] from launch in [[1996]]. The first episodes shown were from April [[1976]]. By the time of the channel's closure in 2004, the repeats had reached January [[1994]].

==Overseas==
''Coronation Street'' is also shown in many countries worldwide. In the [[Republic of Ireland]] it is broadcast on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] according to the ITV schedule in the UK.

Viewers in Northern Ireland can watch Coronation Street on [[UTV]] (a regional company of [[ITV]]) and [[TV3]] because the domestic population of Northern Ireland have access to view both the British Channels ([[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Five (channel)|Five]]) and Irish Channels ([[RTÉ One]], [[RTÉ Two]], [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]] and [[TG4]]). Northern Irish viewers can see the soap opera on at the same time by tuning between [[UTV]] and [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]]. Coronation Street is broadcast on [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]] approximately 2 minutes behind of its broadcast on [[UTV]].<ref>{{cite web |work=TV3 Ireland| title = Programmes Coronation Street|url = http://www.tv3.ie/programmes.php?action=ep_view&id=11606|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>

In [[Canada]], episodes of ''Coronation Street'' air on [[CBC Television]]. As of 2007, episodes appear on CBC about eight-and-a-half months after their UK air date. It moved from a daytime slot on CBC to prime time in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |work=CBC Television, Canada| title= Coronation Street|url=http://www.cbc.ca/coronation/|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>  [[CBC Country Canada]], a [[digital television]] service operated by CBC, broadcasts older episodes as ''Corrie Classics''.<ref>{{cite web |work=CBC Country Canada| title = Coronation Street|url = http://www.cbccountrycanada.ca/coronation.html|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref> The 2002 edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' recognizes the 1,144 episodes sold to CBC-owned [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]] TV station [[CBKST]] by Granada TV on [[31 May]], [[1971]] to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction.

The programme started to be shown in [[Australia]] in 1963 on TCN 9 Sydney, GTV 9 Melbourne and NWS 9 Adelaide and by 1966 ''Corrie'' was more popular in Australia than in the UK.<ref>Little. (1995) p.67.</ref> The show eventually left free-to-air television in Australia in the mid 1970s. It briefly returned on the Nine Network in a daytime slot from 1994 until 1995. In 1996 Pay-TV began and [[Arena (television network)|Arena]] began screening the series in one-hour installments on Saturday and Sundays at 6:30 pm. The series was later moved to Pay-TV channel [[UK.TV]] where it was and still is shown weeknights at 6:00 pm. Episodes on UK.TV are approximately 5 months behind the UK.<ref>{{cite web |work=UKTV Australia| title =  Coronation Street|url = http://www.uktv.com.au/programme.asp?id=19|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>

The series is also currently shown in [[New Zealand]], on [[Television New Zealand|Television New Zealand's]] TV One. In New Zealand, the show consistently rates in the top ten programmes nationally. Hour long episodes are shown at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. "Coro Street catchups" are often scheduled on Wednesdays over summer to prevent falling further behind. Episodes are around eleven months behind those broadcast in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |work=Television New Zealand, TV ONE | title= Coronation Street|url=http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:7MHpMh6A9cMJ:tvnz.co.nz/view/tvone_story_skin/411818%3Fformat%3Dhtml+coronation+street+new+zealand&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>
 
Dutch broadcaster [[VARA (broadcaster)|VARA]] showed 428 sub-titled episodes on [[Netherlands]] TV between 1967 and 1975.

In 2006, the small network Vitaya started broadcasting ''Coronation Street'' for viewers in [[Belgium]], with episodes aired roughly two years behind the UK.<ref>{{cite news|title=Belgian Channel Takes Coronation Street|work=World Screen|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=bel42706.htm|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>  In the [[U.A.E.]], episodes of ''Coronation Street'' are aired two and a half weeks after their UK showing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime to telecast popular UK drama|work=Maktoob business|url=http://business.maktoob.com/News-20050526172723-.aspx.aspx|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>

==Merchandise==

Several classic episodes were released on VHS video in the 1980s and 1990s in different sets, while a number of specially recorded feature-length episodes were released exclusively to video (see [[Coronation Street VHS and DVD releases]]).

''The Street'', a magazine dedicated to the show, was launched in 1989. Edited by Bill Hill, the magazine contained a summary of recent storylines, interviews, articles about classic episodes, and stories that occurred from before 1960. The format was initially [[A5 paper size|A5 size]], expanding to A4 from the seventh issue.<ref>''The Street'', Issue 7, The Street Ltd.</ref> The magazine folded after issue 23 in 1993 when the publisher's contract with Granada Studios Tour expired and Granada wanted to produce their own magazine.<ref>''The Street'', Issue 23, The Street Ltd.</ref>

==Spin-offs==
Granada launched one spin-off in 1965, ''[[Pardon the Expression]]'', following the story of clothing store manager Leonard Swindley ([[Arthur Lowe]]) after he left Weatherfield. Swindley's management experience was tested when he was appointed assistant manager at a fictional [[department store]], Dobson and Hawks. Granada produced two series of the spin-off, which ended in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Lewisohn|title=Pardon The Expression!|work=bbc.co.uk |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/p/pardontheexpress_7775085.shtml|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>                           

In 1968, Arthur Lowe returned as Leonard Swindley in ''Turn Out The Lights'', a sequel to ''Pardon the Expression''. It ran for just six episodes before it was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Lewisohn|title=Turn Out The Lights|work=bbc.co.uk |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/turnoutthelights_7776550.shtml|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>     

In 1999, six special episodes of ''Coronation Street'' were produced, following the story of [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]], [[Vicky McDonald]], [[Vikram Desai]], [[Bet Gilroy]] and [[Reg Holdsworth]] in Brighton.<ref>Little. (2000) p.248.</ref>  This spin-off was subtitled ''The Rover Returns'' and released on VHS tape.

==Sponsorship==
{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}
[[Image:Cadbury_Trebor_Bassett.jpg|frame]]
[[Image:HarveysCorrieVanweb75.jpg|thumb|right|Harveys Publicity stunt]]
[[Cadburys]] was the first [[sponsorship|sponsor]] of ''Coronation Street'' beginning in [[July]] [[1996]]. In the Summer of 2006 [[Cadbury Trebor Bassett]]s had to recall over 1 million chocolate bars, due to suspected salmonella contamination, and ''Coronation Street'' stopped the sponsorship for several months.  In late 2006 Cadbury did not renew their contract, but agreed to sponsor the show until ''Coronation Street'' found a new sponsor. On [[16 September]] [[2007]], the Cadbury sponsor adverts aired for the last time.

In July [[2007]] an ITV press release announced that Harveys (a furniture superstore) was the new sponsor of ''Coronation Street'' on the ITV Network. Harveys' sponsorship began on [[30 September]] [[2007]].
