"'''Wind It Up'''" is a [[pop music|pop]] song written by [[Gwen Stefani]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] originally for inclusion on Stefani's [[Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005]]. Because of favorable reception, the song was later recorded for her second solo album ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006). "Wind It Up" was released as the album's first [[single (music)|single]] in late 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]) and reached the top forty in most music markets.

==Background and writing==
The lyrics of "Wind It Up" include references to Stefani's clothing line, [[L.A.M.B.]], and chronicles Stefani's feelings on how boys are infatuated with staring at her.  The song includes [[yodelling]] and an [[interpolation (music)|interpolation]] of "The Lonely Goatherd" from ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965), written by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]].<ref>Collis, Clark.

"Wind It Up" received generally negative reviews by contemporary pop music critics, and many criticized the inclusion of the ''The Sound of Music'' sample. [[All Music Guide]] said that the song's producers (The Neptunes) forced the sampling "into one of their typical minimalist tracks, over which Gwen spouts off clumsy material-minded lyrics touting her fashion line and her shape".<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]]. [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:w9j9kectyq7x~T10 "The Sweet Escape"]. [[All Music Guide]]. Retrieved [[December 7]] [[2006]].</ref> Chuck Taylor of ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine referred to the song as "a musical brain aneurysm",<ref>Taylor, Chuck.

Retrieved [[November 6]], [[2006]].</ref> while Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] stated that it "gets high marks for entertainment value ... but [it] sounds almost like a retread of old ground".<ref>[http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/winditup.htm About.com]</ref> [[Pitchfork Media]] on the other hand, praised the track for its strangeness, saying that "the sheer nerviness of the idea ultimately sees it through."<ref>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/40049/Gwen_Stefani_The_Sweet_Escape Pithforkmedia.com]</ref>

In face of criticism, Stefani has defended the track, saying "I knew some people wouldn't get it but I think I am enough down the line to not care. The people that did get it are Sound Of Music fans and really got a lot of pleasure from it.‚Äù

"When Pharrell Williams and I first wrote it, it didn't have the sample in it. Then I went to my first big New York L.A.M.B. fashion show and DJ Jeremy Healy did a mash-up for me with it in. When I first heard it I nearly cried. I still think it's brilliant and I stand by it. Why can't you do something weird for a while? These songs are all about having fun, silly records that are to be enjoyed and not taken too seriously."

==Music video==
[[Image:WindItUpVideo.png|left|thumb|The music video features a key motif and incorporations of ''The Sound of Music''.]]

The song's [[music video]] was directed by [[Sophie Muller]] and filmed in [[Los Angeles, California]], [[United States]] and neighboring towns. Although it does not follow a substantial plot, it features outfits and scenery inspired by ''The Sound of Music''. Stefani and her [[Harajuku Girls]] are often dancing in front of fields of flowers and a background of key-like symbols comprised of two G's placed back to back. Throughout the video, Stefani is portrayed as a seamstress and submerged escape artist accompanied by dancers and the Harajuku Girls. In another scene everyone is dressed in pajamas. These scenes are interpretations of famous scenes from "The Sound of Music", Gwen takes the place of Maria in each scene. Said scenes include Maria singing in the fields, sewing the children's playclothes, singing "My Favorite Things" to the children during a rainstorm, and escaping the Nazis at the end of the movie. The song's title is visualized by a colorful sign that reads "wind it up".

"Wind It Up" premiered on [[MTV]]'s top-ten chart program ''[[Total Request Live]]'' on [[November 10]] [[2006]], where it reached number two.<ref>[http://www.popfusion.net/records/recaparchive/2006_11.html "The TRL Archive - Recap - November 2006"].  Popfusion.  Retrieved [[March 17]], [[2007]].</ref>  After its [[November 17]] debut on [[MuchMusic]]'s ''[[Countdown (MuchMusic TV series)|Countdown]]'', it reached number one for the week of [[February 2]] [[2007]]. On [[VH1]]'s ''[[VSpot Top 20 Countdown|Top 20 Video Countdown]]'', it reached number ten.  In a review of the music video, ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' poked fun at the number of personas that appear in the video, referring to some of them as "[[Godzilla|Nunzilla]]", "[[Dominatrix|Gweninatrix]]", and "[[Cinderella|CinderGwennie]]", and stated that "your [[speakers]] have a mute setting for good reason."<ref>Pickard, Anna.
