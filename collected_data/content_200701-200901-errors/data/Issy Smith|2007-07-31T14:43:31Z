'''Issy Smith''' (c. [[18 September]] [[1890]]-[[11 September]] [[1940]]) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. Smith, the first living Jewish recipient of the Victoria Cross, was also awarded the French [[Croix de Guerre]] (with palm) and Russian [[Cross of St. George]] (with palm).<ref>Lieutenant [[Frank Alexander de Pass]] was awarded a posthumous VC in November 1914. A private in the [[First Australian Imperial Force]], [[Leonard Keysor]], was decorated for his actions in August 1915.</ref>  

Born Ishroulch Shmeilowitz (or alternative renderings), to parents residing in Egypt, Smith travelled to Britain as a child stowaway and first volunteered to serve in the British Army at 14. He emigrated to Australia after discharge, where he remained until mobilised as a reservist in 1914. As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, Smith was engaged in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. On [[26 April]] [[1915]], Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers while exposed to sustained fire and attended to them "with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk." His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.

After his demobilisation, Smith returned to Australia with his wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in [[Melbourne]]'s Jewish community, was appointed a [[Justice of the Peace]], and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the [[United Australia Party]] in the [[Australian general election, 1931|1931 general election]].

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[Alexandria]], the son of French citizens Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz. His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. At 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended school and worked as a deliverer in the [[East End of London|East End]], then an impoverished "[[ghetto]]" where [[Yiddish]] was the predominant spoken language .<ref>Rubinstein (2002), ''The Jews in the Modern World: A History Since 1750'', p242</ref> Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain was peaking and was further curtailed by the enactment of the [[Aliens Act 1905]].<ref>Alderman, ''Modern British Jewry'', pp149-150</ref> 

==World War I==

He was 28 years old, and an Acting [[Corporal]] in the 1st Battalion, [[Manchester Regiment]], [[British Army]] during the [[World War I|First World War]] when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On [[26 April]] [[1915]] at [[Saint-Julien, Belgium]], Corporal Smith left his company on his own initiative and went forward towards the enemy's position to help a severely wounded man, whom he carried a distance of 250 yards into safety. When casualties were very heavy later in the day Corporal Smith again displayed great gallantry in helping to bring in more wounded men and attending them, regardless of personal risk.CITATION

NO. 168 A/ Cpl. Issy Smith (SHMULOVITCH ) , 1st.Battalion Manchester Regiment, awarded the Victoria Cross.

Far most conspicuous bravery on April 26th. 1915, near Ypres, when he left his company on his own initiative, and went forward towards the enemy's position to assist a severely wounded man, whom he carried a distance of 250 yards to safety whilst exposed the whole time to heavy machine-gun and rifle fire.

Subsequently Corporal Smith displayed great gallantry when casualties were very heavy, in voluntary assisting to bring in many more wounded men throughout the whole day, and attending them with the greatest devotion to duty, regardless of personal risk.

One of the rescued Sergeant Rooke, told a Daily Mail representative, that he did not know whether Smith's action on that occasion had won him the V.C. or not.

What happened said the sergeant, was this,  " I got wounded near the stream before St. Julien Farm, close to the German trenches.  Corporal Smith took me up on his back and carried me out of the firing line.  Whilst he was doing that Lieutenant W.N.Shipster said he would give a hand, but we had only gone a few yards when the Lieutenant was hit in the neck.  He managed to get to the trench, and Smith carried me there himself.

"Bullets were flying around us at that time, I was only two hundred yards from the German trenches", and the fact that Smith wasn't hit, was a sheer miracle.

He behaved with wonderful coolness and presence of mind the whole time, and no man deserved a Victoria Cross more thoroughly than he did.

He later achieved the rank of [[Sergeant]] and migrated to Australia where he died in 1940.
