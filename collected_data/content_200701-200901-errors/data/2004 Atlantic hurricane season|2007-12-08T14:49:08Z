<!-- Created with subst: of [[Template:Hurricane season single]]. -->The '''2004 Atlantic hurricane season''' officially began on [[June 1]], [[2004]], and lasted until [[November 30]], [[2004]]. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most [[tropical cyclone]]s form in the [[Atlantic basin]]. However, the 2004 season exceeded these conventional limits slightly, as Tropical Storm Otto formed on the last day of the season and lasted two days into December.  The season was well above average in activity, with fifteen named storms and one of the highest [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] totals ever observed.

The season was notable as one of the deadliest and most costly Atlantic hurricane seasons on record, with at least 3,132 deaths and roughly $42 billion (2004 [[US dollars]]) in damage. The most notable storms for the season were the four hurricanes that made landfall in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]], three of them with at least 115 mph (185&nbsp;km/h) sustained winds: [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]], [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]], and [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]]. Jeanne wreaked havoc in [[Haiti]], killing approximately 3,000 people, while Ivan raged through [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], and the [[Cayman Islands]]; Frances and Jeanne both hit the [[Bahamas]] at full force, while Charley caused significant damage in [[Cuba]]. Furthermore, all four of these hurricanes, as well as one tropical storm, hit the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]], with Frances and Jeanne hitting nearly the exact same location within three weeks of each other; floodwaters in the [[southeastern United States]] were brought to near-record levels.

===Pre-season outlook===
On [[May 17]], prior to the start of the season, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] forecasters predicted a 50% probability of activity above the normal range, with 12&ndash;15 tropical storms, 6&ndash;8 of those becoming hurricanes, and 2&ndash;4 of those hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 strength on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].<ref name="NOAA May">{{

This season had 16 tropical depressions, 15 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]). The [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] figure of 225 ranks this as the fourth most active season since 1950 (behind the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]], the [[1950 Atlantic hurricane season|1950 season]] and the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995 season]]).

August 2004 was unusually active, with eight named storms forming during the month. In an average year, only three or four storms would be named in August.<ref name="NHC Aug">{{

A tropical low in May brought torrential flooding to [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], killing 2,000 people and causing great damage.

==Records and notable events==
The 2004 season had numerous unusual occurrences. The first named storm of the season formed on [[August 1]], giving the season the fifth-latest start since the [[1952 Atlantic hurricane season|1952 season]]. [[Tropical Storm Bonnie (2004)|Tropical Storm Bonnie]] and [[Hurricane Charley]] became the first storms to sequentially hit the same [[U.S. state]] — [[Florida]] — within 24 hours of each other in recorded history<!--See article, 1906 doesn't qualify-->. For the remainder of the season, Florida was hit by three more hurricanes: [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]], and [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]]. It was the first time four hurricanes have hit one state in one season since four hurricanes hit the [[Texas]] coast in the [[1886 Atlantic hurricane season|1886 season]], including the [[Indianola Hurricane of 1886]] that destroyed the city of [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]].
{{Most intense hurricanes}}
Other storms were individually unusual. [[Hurricane Alex (2004)|Hurricane Alex]] was the strongest hurricane on record to intensify north of 38°N latitude. One storm, Tropical Storm Earl, died out, and its remains crossed over into the [[Pacific Ocean]], regenerated, and became Hurricane Frank in the eastern Pacific.

The most unusual storm of the season was [[Hurricane Ivan]]. Ivan first impressed meteorologists by becoming the first major [[Atlantic hurricane]] (Category 3 or above) on record to form as low as 10ºN latitude. Ivan was also recorded as the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record up to that point (since pushed down to tenth), with a minimum central pressure of 910 [[mbar]] ([[hPa]]).  One very unusual occurrence in relation to Ivan happened on [[September 22]], when a remnant [[low pressure area|low]] from Ivan — which had traveled in a circular motion over the southeastern United States — was reclassified as a tropical depression as it moved over the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The system was given the name Ivan and eventually strengthened into a respectable [[tropical storm]] with winds of 65 mph (100&nbsp;km/h) before making landfall along the coast of [[Texas]], causing minimal flooding and damage.

<!-- This does not belong here at all. -->Although not part of the [[Atlantic hurricane]] season, one event in the [[South Atlantic]] was so unusual as to merit mention. On [[March 25]], a tropical cyclone (unofficially named [[Cyclone Catarina]]) formed in the [[South Atlantic]]. Catarina is considered to be the first tropical cyclone of hurricane strength to have formed in the South Atlantic since satellite observations began. It made landfall late on [[March 27]] in the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. The storm killed at least three and caused over $350 million (2004 [[USD]]) in damage.

The first storm of the season formed at the end of July off the coast of [[South Carolina]]. Alex strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane, and on [[August 3]] came within 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) of the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] without making landfall. Damage was limited to flooding and wind damage, and in [[Dare County, North Carolina]], was estimated at $2.4 million. There were several injuries and one death reported.<ref name="AlexTCR">{{

On [[August 3]], a tropical wave approaching the [[Lesser Antilles]] organized into Tropical Depression Two. As the storm traveled west over the islands, it dissipated on [[August 4]]. The remnants of Tropical Depression Two continued westward and, on [[August 9]], had strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie in the [[Yucatan Channel]]. Although appearing disorganized, Bonnie showed unusual structure, with a closed eye wall and a ten-mile (16&nbsp;km) wide eye being reported by [[hurricane hunters]] late on August 9 and early on [[August 10]], a feature almost unheard of in tropical cyclones of that intensity. Bonnie was a very small storm, with tropical storm-force winds extending only 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) out from the center. Upper level shear weakened the storm, and Bonnie made landfall as a 45 mph tropical storm just south of [[Apalachicola, Florida]] on [[August 12]]. It accelerated northeastward, and became a remnant area of low pressure on [[August 14]] to the southeast of [[New Jersey]].<ref name="BonnieTCR">{{

Bonnie caused minor to moderate damage across its path. In the southeast [[United States]], the storm caused a tornado outbreak that caused $500,000 (2004 USD) in damage and 3 deaths. In [[New Brunswick]], slick rains from the remnants of Bonnie caused an indirect fatality.

Hurricane Charley formed east of the [[Windward Islands]] on [[August 9]] and moved rapidly west across the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]]. As it neared Jamaica, it became a hurricane and grazed that island on [[August 11]], passing through the [[Cayman Islands]] the next morning. On [[August 12]], Charley passed over mainland [[Cuba]] as a Category 3 hurricane just west of [[Havana]].<ref name="CharleyTCR">{{cite web

}}</ref>

On [[August 13]], Charley unexpectedly underwent rapid strengthening, jumping from a Category 2 to a powerful Category 4 storm in a few hours, while at the same time taking a sharp turn to the northeast. Charley made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane near [[Port Charlotte, Florida]]. Although the storm caused serious damage, much of this was limited to a narrow swath associated with the hurricane's eye wall. Charley was a very fast-moving, compact storm, and so much of its damage was attributed to high winds rather than heavy rain, as is the case in most hurricanes. Charley remained a hurricane across the entire Florida peninsula and passed near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Daytona Beach]]. It later made a second landfall near [[North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]], on [[August 14]]. Charley dissipated near [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[August 15]]. 

Charley caused approximately $14 billion in damage to the United States, making it the fourth costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Fifteen deaths were directly attributed to Charley; four in [[Jamaica]], one in [[Cuba]], and ten in [[Florida]].

At 11 a.m. AST on [[August 13]], a tropical wave formed into Tropical Depression Four around 275 miles (440&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Cape Verde]]. It was the first of five [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]]s of 2004. Twelve hours later, TD4 strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Danielle. Late on [[August 14]], Danielle's wind speeds increased, and it was classified as a hurricane. Danielle moved northwest, peaking at Category Two. It was predicted to curve towards the [[Azores]], but on [[August 18]] lost motion and slackened to a tropical storm. By [[August 19]], the storm had become stationary with minimal storm strength 810 miles (1305&nbsp;km) southwest of the [[Azores]]. The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression the next day, and degenerated to a broad low-pressure area on [[August 21]].<ref name="DanielleTCR">{{

Earl formed initially as the fifth tropical depression of the season on [[August 13]] east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. After traveling west, it reached tropical storm strength on [[August 14]] around 375 miles (605&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Barbados]]. On [[August 15]], Earl passed just south of [[Grenada]] and entered the Caribbean. The storm had degenerated by that point, and that night would have been classified as a tropical wave. However, the government of [[Venezuela]] denied access to their airspace for storm [[reconnaissance]] aircraft. An on-site assessment of Earl's circulation was needed, since satellite observations are inaccurate for that purpose. Earl also posed a threat to land, so advisories continued for another 12 hours.<ref name="EarlTCR">{{

The next morning a reconnaissance aircraft was able to reach the storm. It found no closed circulation, and Earl was reclassified as a tropical wave at 11 a.m. AST on [[August 16]]. Remnants of the storm continued across the Caribbean and into [[Central America]], later becoming Tropical Depression 8E and then Hurricane Frank in the [[Pacific Ocean]] (the first time since 1996, when Hurricane Cesar became Douglas in the Pacific). Earl caused minor damage to [[Grenada]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]].

Frances began as Tropical Depression Six on [[August 24]], and it became a named storm on [[August 25]] while well east of the [[Windward Islands]]. Frances strengthened rapidly, reaching Category 4 intensity by [[August 27]]. Initially forecast to turn north and potentially threaten [[Bermuda]], conditions changed and Frances's predicted track shifted westward. After grazing the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], it plowed through the [[Bahamas]]. From [[September 2]] through [[September 4]], Frances slowly ground its way across the Bahamas. Its slow movement allowed a record 2.5 to 3 million Floridians to evacuate their homes. However, as it ground its way across the Bahamas, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane due to wind shear, although it was still a very large storm.<ref name="FrancesTCR">{{

After sitting stationary off the coast of Florida for nearly 24 hours, Frances finally moved onto the coast of [[Florida]] in the early hours of [[September 5]]. It traveled northwest over land, briefly emerging over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and striking the Florida panhandle. As it passed over [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on [[September 6]], it caused heavy rainfall across the southern U.S. Over 15 inches of rain were recorded in some places in [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]], causing heavy flooding. Frances was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over [[Pennsylvania]] on [[September 9]].

Damage to the United States was approximately $9 billion, making it the 10th costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Most of Hurricane Frances's damage occurred in Florida as a result of the storm's slow movement, large size, and long duration of winds. The storm is directly responsible for seven deaths; one in the Bahamas and six in the [[United States]]. Hurricane Frances also produced a record-setting 123 tornadoes as it moved its way through the United States.

At landfall the storm was originally classified as just shy of hurricane strength. While wind damage in South Carolina was minimal, the slow-moving storm produced five to ten inches (125 to 250 mm) of rain along its path, causing extensive flooding. Gaston moved north over land, weakening to a tropical depression but still bringing torrential rain to central [[Virginia]], where at least eight people were killed in the ensuing floods. The [[Shockoe Bottom]] entertainment district near downtown [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was devastated by the flooding. Total damage was estimated at about $130 million.

Late on [[August 30]], as Tropical Depression Gaston crossed [[Chesapeake Bay]], its winds strengthened, and it was again classified as a tropical storm. It headed out over the Atlantic and became extratropical on [[September 1]], about 185 miles (300&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

On [[November 19]], after a detailed analysis by the NHC, surface-level winds were determined to be about 75 mph (120&nbsp;km/h) at landfall, and Gaston was reclassified as a Category 1 hurricane.

Hermine formed out of an organized area of disturbed weather that had formed about 325 miles (520&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]], or 360 miles (580&nbsp;km) west of [[Bermuda]], and moved  rapidly north towards [[Cape Cod]]. On its northward trek, Hermine left behind most of its convection. The storm made landfall near [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], early on [[August 31]], appearing as little more than a low-level swirl of clouds. It became extratropical a few hours later. The remnant low centre tracked up the Bay of Fundy later on [[August 31]]. Some rainfall and thunderstorms over [[Long Island]] and parts of [[New England]] were attributed to Hermine, but most people did not realize a tropical storm had struck.<ref name="HermineTCR">{{

Ivan was a [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] that began as Tropical Depression Nine on [[September 2]]. It became a tropical storm on [[September 3]], and a hurricane on [[September 5]] while 1,040 miles (1670&nbsp;km) east of the Windward Islands, at 9.9° N. Later that day, while at 10.6° N, it unexpectedly underwent rapid strengthening, reaching Category 4 intensity by that evening. It was the strongest storm to have ever been known to intensify that far south. Ivan weakened slightly while continuing westward, and struck [[Grenada]] on [[September 7]].<ref name="IvanTCR">{{

While moving westward through the [[Caribbean Sea]], Ivan quickly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane. It fluctuated in strength over the next few days, and passed within 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) of [[Grand Cayman]] on [[September 11]]. Ivan grazed western [[Cuba]] as a Category 5, and moved into the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane turned northward over cooler waters, and made landfall in southern [[Alabama]] on [[September 16]] as a 130 mph (210&nbsp;km/h) hurricane. Ivan weakened rapidly to a tropical depression over Alabama, accelerated to the northeast, and became extratropical over the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] on [[September 18]]. Ivan's remnants turned to the southeast then southwest, and gradually re-organized over the warm Gulf Stream waters. After crossing southern [[Florida]] on [[September 21]] the system regained tropical characteristics over the Gulf of Mexico, and became a tropical storm on [[September 23]] while 140 miles (220&nbsp;km) south of [[Louisiana]]. Ivan moved to the northwest, and reached winds of 60 mph (95&nbsp;km/h) before making landfall near [[Cameron, Louisiana]]. Ivan quickly deteriorated over [[Texas]], and dissipated on [[September 24]].

Hurricane Ivan directly killed 92 people throughout the Caribbean and United States and caused approximately $13 billion in damage to the United States, making it the fifth costliest hurricane in United States history. The hurricane destroyed 90% of Grenada's structures and devastated the island's economy, and destroyed 85% of the buildings on Grand Cayman. The combination of Hurricane Ivan with the previous rains of Frances  brought many rivers in the Southeastern U.S. to near-record flood levels. Ivan was the strongest storm of the season, and the only 2004 Atlantic hurricane to reach Category 5 intensity. Its low pressure reading of 910 mbar made it the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time.

Jeanne formed as a tropical depression east-southeast of [[Guadeloupe]] on the evening of [[September 13]]. Having strengthened to a tropical storm, Jeanne crossed [[Puerto Rico]] on [[September 15]]. It then moved toward [[Hispaniola]], barely reaching hurricane strength before making landfall on [[September 16]]. It tracked slowly across the northern coast of the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]], its heavy rains bringing mudslides and flooding. Jeanne's unusually slow journey was actually caused by a weakening Hurricane Ivan. Ivan broke up a trough that was fueling Jeanne's steering currents. Interaction with Hispaniola caused it to degenerate into a tropical depression.<ref name="JeanneTCR">{{

After wreaking havoc on Hispaniola, Jeanne struggled to reorganize. However, it eventually began strengthening and headed north. After performing a complete loop over the open Atlantic, it headed westwards, strengthening into a Category 3 hurricane and passing over the islands of [[Great Abaco]] and [[Grand Bahama]] in the [[Bahamas]] on [[September 25]]. Jeanne made landfall later in the day in Florida just 2 miles (3 kilometers) from where Frances had struck 3 weeks earlier. Building on the rainfall of [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]] and [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]], Jeanne brought near-record flood levels as far north as [[West Virginia]] and [[New Jersey]] before its remnants turned east into the open Atlantic.

Jeanne is blamed for at least 3,006 deaths in [[Haiti]] with about 2,800 in [[Gonaïves]] alone, which was nearly washed away by floods and mudslides. The storm also caused 7 deaths in [[Puerto Rico]], 18 in the [[Dominican Republic]] and at least 4 in [[Florida]], bringing the total number of deaths to at least 3,025. Final property damage in the United States was $6,800,000,000, making this the 13th costliest hurricane in U.S. history.

Karl continued strengthening and became a 145 mph (230&nbsp;km/h) Category 4 hurricane on [[September 21]]. It fluctuated in intensity over the next few days, reaching Category 4 strength on two different occasions. It moved steadily northwards, staying hundreds of miles from any land, until it began to weaken and become extratropical over cooler waters. Karl was still of Category 1 strength when it became an extratropical system on [[September 24]] over the far northern Atlantic at about 47° N. The extratropical system struck the [[Faroe Islands]] two days later with 144&nbsp;km/h (89 mph) wind gusts. [http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/karl_blaeste_pa_faeroeerne]

Tropical Depression Thirteen developed from a tropical wave 650 miles (1,045&nbsp;km) west-southwest of the [[Cape Verde]] islands on [[September 19]]. It became Tropical Storm Lisa at 8 a.m. AST on [[September 20]] with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80&nbsp;km/h). A very small storm, its development was hindered by its proximity to Hurricane Karl. On [[September 22]], Lisa began merging with a large tropical disturbance to its east and weakened to a tropical depression for a couple of days before regaining tropical storm strength on [[September 25]]. By then it was heading generally northwards in the mid-Atlantic. Lisa went through several phases of weakening and strengthening as it headed north, finally reaching hurricane strength on [[October 1]], and again the next day.<ref name="LisaTCR">{{

At the time, Lisa earned the record for being a named tropical cyclone (i.e., after first reaching Tropical Storm strength) for 11 days before becoming a hurricane. ([[Hurricane Dennis (1981)|Hurricane Dennis]] of [[1981 Atlantic hurricane season|1981]] took longer overall but dropped to a tropical wave before regenerating.) However, [[Hurricane Irene %282005%29|Hurricane Irene]] beat this record in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. (Subsequent reevaluation determined that Lisa only became a hurricane on [[October 2]], after 11¾ days as a named cyclone. Its total development time from tropical depression to hurricane, at 12½ days, is second only to [[1990 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Josephine|Hurricane Josephine]] of [[1990 Atlantic hurricane season|1990]].) 

Lisa was a hurricane only briefly, moving over cooler waters and weakening to a tropical storm. It became extratropical early on [[October 3]] while located about 475 miles (760&nbsp;km) north-northwest of the [[Azores]]. It never threatened any land area.

Matthew began with a tropical wave that entered the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. This wave grew into a large area of low pressure in the western Gulf.

On the afternoon of [[October 8]], the low pressure system developed into Tropical Storm Matthew 260 miles (420&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Brownsville, Texas]]. Matthew was a minimal tropical storm, and its sustained winds stayed at or near 40 mph (64&nbsp;km/h) from its naming until landfall on [[October 10]]. It became extratropical inland over [[Louisiana]] later in the day, and dissipated when it was near [[El Dorado, Arkansas]].

Matthew brought up to 12 inches (300 mm) of rain to southern Louisiana. About a dozen homes were flooded in [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne Parish]] after a [[canal]] [[levee]] burst, and streets in [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]] were reportedly under 2 feet (60 cm) of water. The remnants of Matthew continued to spin inland and delivered heavy rainfall for at least five more days. No injuries or deaths were reported.

Nicole continued heading generally northeastward over cooler waters and was declared fully [[extratropical]] on [[October 11]] while 345 miles (555&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. The [[Canadian Hurricane Centre]] continued to issue advisories on, as they called it, post-tropical Storm Nicole (actually a system absorbed by another extratropical low) for another day as it moved closer to land and dropped heavy rainfall on the [[Maritimes]]. The low containing the remnants of Nicole finally merged with another larger low-pressure area while in the vicinity of [[Anticosti Island]] on [[October 14]]. No injuries or deaths were reported.

Since 2002, subtropical storms have been assigned names from the same sequence as tropical storms. Nicole was the first named storm under this dispensation that never achieved tropical status.

The tropical storms of 2004 ranked from highest to lowest [[Accumulated cyclone energy|Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] (ACE) given to three [[significant figures]]. The total for the season was 225. This makes it the fourth most energetic season since 1950.<ref name="NCDC ACE">[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2004/2004-atlantic-trop-cyclones.html US National Climatic Data Center - Atlantic Basin 2004 Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index]</ref>

ACE measures the strength and duration of a tropical cyclone. Hurricane Ivan, because it was such a long lasting and strong Cape Verde-type hurricane, contributed almost one-third of the ACE value for 2004. Ivan had the second-highest ACE of any tropical cyclone recorded in the Atlantic, behind only [[Hurricane San Ciriaco]] of 1899.

{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricanes}}
The [[World Meteorological Organization]] retired four names in the spring of 2005: Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. They will be replaced in 2010 by Colin, Fiona, Igor, and Julia. The 2004 season was tied with the [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season|1955 season]] and [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995 season]] for the most storm names retired after a single season until the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]], when five names were retired.
