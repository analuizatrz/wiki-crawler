'''Juan Domingo Perón''' ([[October 8]], [[1895]] &ndash; [[July 1]], [[1974]]) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[general]] and [[politician]], elected three times as [[President of Argentina]] and serving from [[1946]] to [[1955]] and from [[1973]] to [[1974]]. 

Perón and his second wife [[Eva Perón|Eva]] were immensely popular among a portion of the Argentine people and still considered iconic figures by followers of the [[Peronist Party]].  Perón followers lauded his efforts to eliminate [[poverty]] and to dignify labor, while his detractors considered him a [[Demagogy|demagogue]] and a [[dictator]].  He started the political movement known as [[Peronism]], still popular in Argentina to this day, which professes to be a [[third way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. 

==Childhood and youth==
Perón was born in a town near [[Lobos]], [[Province of Buenos Aires]].  He was the son of Mario Tomás Perón, a farmer whose family was partially [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and Juana Sosa, who is believed to have been of mixed [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] descent. 

Further research undertaken by the Argentine journalist and writer [[Tomas Eloy Martinez]], and reported in his books "Memoirs of the General" and "The Perón Novel", indicate that Perón was probably illegitimate.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  When his parents finally married, they acknowledged Juan and his brother.  It is believed this information was kept hidden and denied for years because it would have likely ruined Perón's career had it been known.

Perón married his first wife, [[Aurelia Tizón]], on  [[January 5]], [[1929]], but she died of [[uterine cancer]] nine years later.  He called her "Potota."

Perón received a strict [[Catholic]] upbringing.  He entered a military school at age 16, and following graduation he made good progress through the ranks.  In 1938 he was sent by the Army to [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Albania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] as a military observer, during which time he became familiar with the government of [[Benito Mussolini]] and other European governments of the time.

==Military government of 1943-1946==
In May 1943, as a [[colonel]], he was a significant figure in the [[military coup]] by the GOU ([[United Officers' Group]]), a secret society, against the conservative civilian government of [[Ramón Castillo]].  Initially secretary to [[Secretary of War]] General [[Edelmiro Farrell]], under the administration of General [[Pedro Ramírez]], he later became the head of the then-insignificant [[Department of Labor]].
[[Image:17deoctubre-enlafuente.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration for Perón's release, on October 17th, 1945.]]
Perón's growing power and influence during the military government came from his alliance with a sector of the Argentine [[labor union]]s, mainly with the [[socialist]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] movements<ref>{{es icon}}

.  After the coup, one part of the workers' movement, mainly the socialist part from the labor union [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]] Nº1, decided to make contact with Colonels Perón and [[Mercante]] through the mercantile labor leader [[Borlenghi]] and through the [[railroad]] union [[lawyer]] [[Bramuglia]].  Their conversations established an initial alliance to promote labor laws that had long been demanded by the workers' movement, strengthen the unions, and transform the  Department of Labor into an important government office. <!--Perón's position as head of the Department of Labor was elevated to a cabinet-level secretariat in November of [[1943]]. (Baily,84; López, 401) -->

He became Vice President and Secretary of War under General [[Edelmiro Farrell]] (February 1944).  Forced into resignation by opponents within the [[armed forces]] on [[October 9]], [[1945]], Perón was arrested, but mass [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] organized by the CGT [[trade union]] federation forced his release on [[October 17]].  Four days later, he married his second wife, [[Eva Duarte de Perón|Eva Duarte]] (1919&ndash;1952), who became hugely popular.  Known as Evita, she helped her husband develop support with labor and women's groups.

==Election as president and first term (1946-1952)==
Perón leveraged his popular support into victory in the [[February 24]], [[1946]] presidential elections. 

Once in office, Perón pursued social policies aimed at empowering the working class.  He greatly expanded the number of unionized workers, and helped establish the powerful [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour (CGT)]], created in 1930.  He called this the "third position", between capitalism and communism.  Perón also pushed hard to industrialize the country; in 1947 he announced the first [[five-year plan]] to boost newly nationalized industries.  [[Peronism]] became a central influence in Argentine political parties, and Perón continued to exert a strong influence after the 1955 [[Revolución Libertadora|military uprising]] which forced him into exile.

Among the upper class Argentines, the improvement of the laborers' situation was a source of resentment; negative feelings abounded towards the new industrial workers from rural areas, who had formerly been treated as servants.  It was common for better-off Argentines to refer to these workers using racist slurs like ''"black heads"'' (cabecitas negras, the name of a like bird), ''"fats"'' ("grasas"), ''"un-shirted"'' ("descamisados", conveying the idea that they "took off their jackets and/or shirts"), and the [[Radical Civic Union|radical]] deputy [[Ernesto Sammartino]] said that the people who vote for Perón were a "''zoological flood''" ("aluvión zoológico").<ref>[http://ricardobalbin.tripod.com/los44.htm Quoted by Hugo Gambini in his book "Historia del peronismo"]  Sammartino used that phrase in the Parliament on June, 1947.  He said, in Spanish: ''"El '''aluvión zoológico''' del 24 de febrero parece haber arrojado a algún diputado a su banca, para que desde ella maúlle a los astros por una dieta de 2.500 pesos.  Que siga maullando, que a mí no me molesta. .."''</ref>  In the 1940s the upper-class students were the first group to oppose Peronist workers, using the slogan: ''"[[peon]]-footwear [=espadrilles] dictatorship, NO!"'' ("No a la dictadura de las alpargatas").  Another famous graffito revealing the strong opposition between Peronists and anti-Peronists appeared in high-class districts in the 1950s saying, ''"Long live cancer!"'' (¡Viva el cáncer!), when [[Eva Perón]] was dying of cancer.<ref>[http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/frases/evaperon/vivaelcancer.php Eduardo Galeano , Memorias del Fuego , México, Siglo XXI, 1990]</ref>  She finally died of [[uterine cancer]] in 1952 at the age of thirty-three.<ref>Lerner, BH (2000).  The illness and death of Eva Perón: cancer, politics, and secrecy. Lancet 355:1988-1991</ref>

Weiss (2005, p.45) recalls events related to the universities:
<blockquote>
As a young student in Buenos Aires in the early 1950s, I well remember the graffiti found in many an empty wall all over town: "Build the Fatherland. Kill a Student" (''Haga patria, mate un estudiante''). [Perón] was also against the universities, who questioned his methods and his goals.  A well-remembered slogan runs, ''Alpargatas sí, libros no'' ("[[peon]] footwear [=espadrilles]  yes, books no"). Universities were [then] "intervened".  In some, a ''Peronista'' mediocrity was appointed rector.  Others were closed for years.
</blockquote>

Between 1947 and 1950, Argentina manufactured two advanced jet aircraft called [[I.Ae. 27 Pulqui I|Pulqui I]] (designed  by the Argentinian engineers Cardehilac, Morchio and Ricciardi with the French [[Emile Dewoitine]], condemned in France in absentia for [[Collaborationism]]), and [[FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II|Pulqui II]] designed by [[Kurt Tank]].  In the main test flights the planes were flown by Argentine Lieutenant Edmundo Osvaldo Weiss and Kurt Tank himself, reaching 1000 km/h with the Pulqui II.  Argentina continued testing the Pulqui II until 1959; during that time two pilots lost their lives.<ref>[http://www.lucheyvuelve.com.ar/pulqui/pulqui1.htm El proyecto Pulqui: propaganda peronista de la época]</ref>  The Pulqui project opened the door to develop two successful Argentinian planes: [http://www.choiquehobbies.com.ar/revista/notas/pucara/Pucara.htm I.A.58"Pucara] and the [http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/material/pampa.html I.A.63'Pampa] manufactured at the Aircraft Factory of Córdoba.<ref>http://www.reconstruccion2005.com.ar/0412/aviacion.htm La aviación militar apunta a Cordoba
como vector comercial del poder aéreo</ref> 

In 1951, Perón announced that the [[Huemul Project]] would produce nuclear fusion before any other country.  In charge of the project was a swindling Austrian of German origin, [[Ronald Richter]], who had been recommended by Kurt Tank who was expecting to power his aircraft with Richter's invention.  Perón announced that the energy produced by Richter would be delivered in milk-bottle sized containers.  Success of the project was announced in 1951, but no proof was shown.  On 1952 Perón appointed a scientific team to investigate Richter's activities.  The reports by [[José Antonio Balseiro]], and Mario Báncora revealed that the project was a fraud.  After that, the assets of the Huemul Project were transferred to the Centro Atómico Bariloche (CAB) of the Argentine [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA) and to the physics institute of the [[Universidad Nacional de Cuyo]] which was later named [[Instituto Balseiro]] (IB). 

=== Protection of Nazi war criminals ===
{{see|Ratlines (history)}}
After World War II, Argentina became a leading haven for Nazi war criminals, with the explicit protection of Juan Perón. Historian [[Uki Goñi]] showed in his 1998 book that along with Nazis and French and Belgian [[collaborationists]], including [[Pierre Daye]], Peron organized a meeting in the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'' during which a network was created, which benefitted from support by the Immigration Service and diplomatic civil servants. The Swiss Chief of Police Heinrich Rothmund [http://www.millersville.edu/~holo-con/epstein.html] and the Croatian Roman Catholic priest [[Krunoslav Draganović]] also helped organize the [[ratlines (history)|ratline]] <ref name=PaginaUki> [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-14198-2002-12-15.html La Odessa que creó Perón], ''[[Pagina/12]]'', 15 December 2002 {{es icon}} </ref>. According to Goñi, 1948 was the most active year, during which the SS [[Carlos Fuldner]] was in Switzerland with a special passport which described him as "special envoy of the President of Argentina." In 1946, Cardinal [[Antonio Caggiano]] went to the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] to offer his country, in the name of the Argentine government, as a refuge for French collaborationists who had fled to Rome <ref name=PaginaUki/>.

The network was managed by [[Rodolfo Freude]] who had an office in the Casa Rosada and was close to Eva Peron's brother, [[Juan Duarte]], as the [[DAIA]] found out in 1997, investigating 22,000 documents. According to the historian Ronald Newton, [[Ludwig Freude]], father of the first, was the probable local representative of the Office Three secret service headed by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], with probably more influence than the German ambassador [[Edmund von Thermann]]. He had met Peron in the 1930s, and had contacts with Generals [[Juan Pistarini]], [[Domingo Martínez]] and [[José Domingo Molina Gómez|Molina]]. Ludwig Freude's house became the meeting center during the war for Nazis and Argentine military in favor of the [[Axis]]. In 1943, he went with Peron to Europe to try to set an arms deal with Germany. <ref> [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/202464 La rama nazi de Perón], ''[[La Nacion]]'', 16 February 1997 {{es icon}} </ref>.

Examples include French collaborationist [[Emile Dewoitine]], who arrived in May 1946 and worked designing the [[Pulqui]] jet, [[Erich Priebke]], who arrived in Argentina in 1947, [[Josef Mengele]] who arrived in 1949, [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1950, his adjutant [[Franz Stangl]], Austrian representative of [[Spitzy]] in Spain, [[Reinhard Spitzy]], [[Charles Lescat]], editor of ''[[Je Suis Partout]]'' in [[Vichy France]], SS [[Ludwig Lienhardt]], German industrialist [[Ludwig Freude]], SS [[Klaus Barbie]].  As well, many members of the notorious Croatian [[Ustaše]] took refuge in Argentina, as did [[Milan Stojadinovich]], Prime minister of occupied Yugoslavia <ref name=Time> [[Mark Falcoff]], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1998/int/981109/latin_america.perons_na30a.html Peron's Nazi Ties], ''[[Time]]'', November 9, 1998, vol 152, n°19 </ref>. As in the United States ([[Operation Paperclip]]), Argentina also welcomed displaced German technicians such as [[Kurt Tank]] and [[Ronald Richter]]. Some of these refugees had important roles in Peron's Argentina, such as French collaborationist [[Jacques de Mahieu]], who became an ideologue of the Peronist movement, before becoming a mentor to a Roman Catholic nationalist youth group in the 1960s. Belgian collaborationist [[Pierre Daye]] became editor of one of the official Peronist magazines. [[Rodolfo Freude]], son of Ludwig, became Peron's chief of presidential intelligence during his first term. Stojadinovitch founded in 1951 ''[[El Economista]]'', which still carries his name on its masthead. The Croatian Roman Catholic priest [[Krunoslav Draganović]], organizer of the San Girolamo ratline, had been deputed by Peron to help Nazis escape to Argentina, including [[Ante Pavelic]] <ref name=Time/>.

Recently, [[Uki Goñi]]'s research, drawing on investigations in Argentine, Swiss, American, [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Belgian]] government archives, as well as numerous interviews and other sources, was detailed extensively in ''The Real [[ODESSA|Odessa]]: Smuggling the Nazis to Perón's Argentina'' (2002), showing how [[ratlines (history)|ratlines]] escape routes were used by [[ex-Nazi|former NSDAP members]] and like-minded people to escape trial and judgment. <ref>[[Uki Goñi]], ''The Real [[ODESSA|Odessa]]: Smuggling the Nazis to Perón's Argentina'' (2002) (Granta Books, 2002, ISBN 1862075816) </ref>  Uki Goñi places particular emphasis on the part played by the government of Juan Perón in organizing the ratlines, as well as documenting the aid of Swiss and Vatican authorities in their flight. The Argentine consulate in [[Barcelona]] handed out false passports to fleeing Nazi war criminals and collaborationists.

==The second term (1952-1955)==

Perón won re-election in 1951.  During his second term Perón's administration faced serious economic problems.  Perón called employers and unions to a Productivity Congress with the aim of regulating social conflict through social dialogue, but the congress failed and a deal was not possible.

At the same time Perón signed a contract with an American oil company, [[Standard Oil of California]], on May 1955, opening an economic policy of development with the help of foreign industrial investments.  The radical party leader, [[Arturo Frondizi]], considered it to be an anti-patriotic decision, but three years later he himself signed several contracts with foreign oil companies.

During the second term several terrorist acts were committed against civilian targets.  On [[April 15]], [[1953]], a terrorist group detonated two bombs in a public rally at [[Plaza de Mayo]], killing 7 citizens and injuring 95.  On [[June 15]], [[1955]], a failed coup d'état by anti-Peronists used navy aircraft to bomb Peronists at [[Plaza de Mayo]], killing 364 citizens.  This barbaric act is considered a prelude to the [[dirty war]] in Argentina between 1976 and 1983.

In 1954, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which supported Perón's government up to that year, confronted Perón because of the enactment of the divorce law, among other reasons. Following the expulsion of two Catholic priests from the country, Peron was excommunicated from the Church by the Pope in [[1955]].  On [[September 16]], [[1955]], a nationalist Catholic group of both the Army and Navy, led by General [[Eduardo Lonardi]], General [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu|Pedro E. Aramburu]] and Admiral [[Isaac Rojas]], took power in a coup which they named ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'' (the "Liberating Revolution").  The military regime accused Peronist leaders of corruption, but no one was prosecuted.

==Exile (1955-1973)==

[[Image:Parag.871.Stroessner,Peron.jpeg|right|thumb|Presidents Stroessner and Perón. The stamp is Scott Paraguay no. 871]]

After the military coup, Perón went into [[exile]] in [[Paraguay]].  His escape was facilitated by his friend President [[Alfredo Stroessner]] of Paraguay, who placed a gunboat at his disposal in the Río de la Plata (river).  Later he lived  in [[Panama]], where he met nightclub bolero singer [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|María Estela Martínez]] (aka Isabel Perón).  Eventually settling in [[Madrid, Spain|Madrid]] in [[Franquist Spain]] he married her there in 1961.  Back in Argentina, Peronism was banned and Peronists were persecuted.  In 1963, the Aramburu decree made illegal the simple naming of Juan Perón.

In Argentina, the 1950s and 1960s were marked by frequent [[coups d'état]] in addition to low economic growth in the 1950s and some of the highest growth rates in the world in the 1960s (Gerchunoff et al, 309-321).  Argentina also faced problems of continued social and labour demands.  During those years poverty highly decreased, with rates <!-- of what? such statistics are to be taken carefully. What is "poverty"? what's the threshold? --> between 2% and 5% {{Fact|date=February 2007}} in the first years of the 1960s ([[INDEC]]).  Argentine painter [[Antonio Berni]]'s works reflected the social tragedies of these times.  In particular, Berni dealt with life hardships in the ''[[villas miseria]]'' (shanty towns) through his series Juanito Laguna, a slum child, and Ramona Montiel, a prostitute. During this time, Peron was allowed back into the church, the Pope's ban being lifted in [[1963]]. 

Perón sent his third wife, [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel]], to Argentina in 1965, to meet political dissidents there.  She organized a reunion in the house of mayor Bernardo Alberte, Perón's delegate and sponsor of various left-wing Peronist movements such as the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT de los Argentinos]], a labor union federation.  Between 1968 and 1972, the CGT of the Argentines gathered opponents to [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]'s dictatorship, and would have an important role in the 1969 ''[[Cordobazo]]'' insurrection.  During this travel, [[José López Rega]], future founder of the [[Anticommunist Argentine Alliance|Triple A]] death squad, managed to win Isabel's trust, and then traveled to Spain. There, he worked first for Perón's security before becoming the couple's personal secretary.

On the other hand, Perón supported the more active unions, and maintained close links with the [[Montoneros]], a left-wing Catholic Peronist group.  On June 1, 1970, the Montoneros kidnapped and assassinated former anti-Peronist dictator [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]], in retaliation for the [[June 1956]] Leon Suarez massacre and the execution of [[Juan José Valle]], who had headed a Peronist uprising against the junta.

General [[Alejandro Lanusse]] took power in March 1971 and, faced with strong opposition and social conflicts, declared his intention to restore constitutional democracy by 1973.  From exile Perón supported both left-wing Peronists and right-wing Peronists. He supported as well conservative radicals such as [[Ricardo Balbín]], member of the [[Radical Civic Union]] and an old opponent of Perón's, but also people such as left-wing Peronist [[Héctor José Cámpora]], who also became his "personal secretary." In 1971, he sent two letters to the film director [[Octavio Getino]], one congratulating him for his work of liberation carried out, along with [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Gerardo Vallejo (film-maker)|Gerardo Vallejo]], in the ''[[Grupo Cine Liberación]]'', and another concerning two [[film documentaries]] that were to be done with him (''La Revolución Justicialista'' and ''Actualización política y doctrinaria'') <ref name=Tercer> Oscar Ranzani, [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/cultura/7-42538-2004-10-20.html La revolución es un sueño eterno], ''[[Pagina 12]]'', 20 October 2004 {{es icon}}</ref>. 

Finally, several members of the right-wing [[Tacuara Nationalist Movement]], considered as the first Argentine guerrilla group, turned towards him.  Founded in the beginning of the 1960s, the Tacuaras were a fascist, anti-Semitic and anti-conformist group founded on the model of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]'s [[Falange]], who at first strongly opposed Peronism.  However, they split after the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] into three main different groups.  Opposed to the alliance with Peronism, Catholic priest Meinvielle retained the original ideological, and anti-Peronist, hard-line stance.  [[Dardo Cabo]], to the contrary, founded the [[Movimiento Nueva Argentina]] (MNA, Movement New Argentina), officially launched on June 9, 1961, in commemoration of General [[Juan José Valle]]’s Peronist uprising in 1956.  The MNA became the ancestor of all modern Catholic nationalist groups in Argentina.  Finally, [[Joe Baxter]] and [[José Luis Nell]] decided to join the Peronism movement, believing in its revolutionary capacities.  They created the [[Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario Tacuara]] (MNRT, Revolutionary Nationalist Tacuara Movement) which, without forsaking nationalism, cut away from the Church, the right-wing and anti-Semitism.  Baxter’s MNRT became progressively more left-wing and attracted by Marxism.  Many of the [[Montoneros]] and of the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]]’s leaders would come from this party.

==The third term (1973-1974)==

On [[March 11]], [[1973]], general elections were held.  Perón was banned from running, but a stand-in candidate, [[Héctor Cámpora]],a left-wing Peronist and his personal secretary, was elected and took office on [[May 25]].  On [[June 20]], [[1973]], Perón returned from Spain to end an 18-year exile. According to ''[[Pagina 12]]'' newspaper, [[Licio Gelli]], headmaster of [[Propaganda Due]], had provided to Perón the [[Alitalia]] [[Boeing]] plane to return to his native country <ref name=P12> Susana Viau and Eduardo Tagliaferro, [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1998/98-12/98-12-14/pag03.htm Carlos Bartffeld, Mason y Amigo de Massera, Fue Embajador en Yugoslavia Cuando Se Vendieron Armas a Croacia - En el mismo barco], ''[[Pagina 12]]'', [[December 14]], [[1998]] {{es icon}}</ref>. Gelli was part of the committee supporting Perón, along with the young man [[Carlos Saúl Menem]] (future President of Argentina in the 1980s-90s) <ref name=P12/>. The Italian former Premier [[Giulio Andreotti]] has recalled an encounter between Perón, his wife Isabel Martínez and Gelli, assuring that Perón had knelt before Licio Gelli to salute him <ref name=P12/>.

On the day of Perón's return, a crowd of left-wing Peronists (estimated at 3.5 million) had gathered at the Ezeiza airport in Buenos Aires to welcome and support him.  Perón came accompanied by Cámpora, whose first measure had been to grant [[amnesty]] to all [[political prisoner]]s and to reestablish relations with Cuba, helping [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] break the [[United States embargo against Cuba|US embargo]].  This, and his social policies, had also earned him the opposition of the right-wing Peronists, including the trade-unionist bureaucracy.

From Perón's tribune, camouflaged snipers, including members of the [[Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance]] (aka Triple A), opened fire on the crowd.  The left-wing Peronist Youth and the [[Montoneros]] had been trapped.  At least 13 people were killed (who have been identified), and 365 injured during this episode, which became known as the [[1973 Ezeiza massacre|Ezeiza massacre]].<ref>{{es icon}} [[Horacio Verbitsky]], ''Ezeiza'', Contrapunto, Buenos Aires, 1985. Available at [http://www.elortiba.org/ezeiza.html ElOrtiba].</ref>

Cámpora resigned in July 1973, paving the way for new elections, this time with Perón's participation.  Argentina had by this time reached a peak of instability, and Perón was viewed by many as the country's only hope for prosperity and salvation. 

UCR's leader [[Ricardo Balbín]] and Perón considered a Peronist-Radical joint government, but internal opposition in both parties made this impossible.  Perón's overwhelming victory (62% of the vote), returned him to the presidency.  In October 1973 he began his third term,  with [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel]], his wife, as Vice President.

Perón's third term was marked by an escalating conflict between the Peronist left- and right-wing factions.  This turmoil was fueled primarily by Perón's growing ties with conservative Radical Party leader Ricardo Balbín, who the opposition led by [[Raúl Alfonsín]] considered a right-wing radical.  The Montoneros began to become marginalized in the Peronist movement, mocked by Perón himself after the June 20, 1973 Ezeiza massacre.  Another guerrilla group, the Guevarist ERP, also opposed itself to the Peronist right-wing, and started engaging itself in [[armed struggle]], trying to create a [[foco]] in the province of [[Tucuman]], the smallest province of Argentina located in the Northwest.  Meanwhile, [[José Lopez Rega]], personal secretary of Juan Perón and then of Isabel Perón, began targeting left-wing opponents.

Perón died of a heart attack on [[July 1]], [[1974]] recommending that his wife, Isabel, rely on Balbín for support.  At the president's burial Balbín uttered a historic phrase, "This old adversary bids farewell to a friend".

Isabel Perón succeeded her husband to the presidency, but proved thoroughly incapable of managing the country's mounting political and economic problems, the left-wing insurgency and the reaction of the extreme right.  Ignoring her late husband's advice, Isabel granted Balbín no role in her new government, instead granting broad powers to López Rega, who started engaging in a "[[dirty war]]" against political opponents.

Isabel Perón's term was ended abruptly on [[March 24]], [[1976]] by a military coup d'état.  A [[military junta]], headed by [[Jorge Rafael Videla|General Jorge Videla]] took control of the country, starting the self-styled [[National Reorganization Process]].  The junta combined a widespread persecution of political dissidents with the use of [[state terrorism]].  The final death toll rose to thousands (no less than 9,000, with human rights organizations claiming it was closer to 30,000).  Most of this number is accounted for by "the [[forced disappearance|disappeared]]" (''desaparecidos''), people kidnapped and executed without trial and without record.

==Perón's corpse==
Perón was buried in [[La Chacarita Cemetery]] in [[Buenos Aires]].  In [[1987]], his tomb was defaced, and the hands (and some personal effects, such as his sword) of his [[Dead body|corpse]] were stolen.  Those responsible have never been found, but some say it was the responsibility of Licio Gelli, leader of the P2 [[Propaganda Due]] Italian Freemasonic lodge. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

On [[17 October]] [[2006]] his body was moved to a new mausoleum in the Buenos Aires suburb of [[San Vicente, Buenos Aires|San Vicente]], his former summer residence, which was rebuilt as a museum.  A few people were injured in riots, as trade unions affiliated to the Peronist movement fought over access to the ceremony.  The police were able to contain the violence enough for the procession to move to the mausoleum.  The move of Perón's body offered the self-proclaimed illegitimate daughter of Perón the opportunity to obtain a DNA sample from his corpse which, she hoped, would prove that she was indeed his daughter.  The woman, Martha Holgado, 72, had been trying for 15 years to do this DNA analysis, which, in [[November 2006]], proved negative - she is not his daughter.<ref>CNN. 17 October 2006.
