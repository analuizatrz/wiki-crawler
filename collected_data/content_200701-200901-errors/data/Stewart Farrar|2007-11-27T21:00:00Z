'''Stewart Farrar''' ([[June 28]] [[1916]]&ndash;[[February 7]] [[2000]]) was an [[England|English]] author of books on [[Alexandrian Wicca]].  Along with his wife, [[Janet Farrar]], he was an influential [[Neopagan]] author and teacher.  According to George Knowles, "some seventy five percent of [[Wicca]]ns both in the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]] and [[Northern Ireland|North of Ireland]] can trace their roots back to the Farrar's [sic]"<ref name="KnowlesRabinovitch">{{cite web | title=Stewart Farrar (1916-2000) | work=Controverscial.Com | author=George Knowles | url=http://www.controverscial.com/Stewart%20Farrar.htm | accessdate=December 10 | accessyear=2005}}  This claim is repeated in {{cite book | author=Rabinovitch, Shelley and Lewis, James R. | title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism | pages=96-97 | publisher=Citadel Press | year=2004 | id=ISBN 0-8065-2407-3}}</ref>  A journalist, scriptwriter, and [[World War II]] veteran, Farrar also published a number of works of fiction, including [[detective novels]], many of which dealt with the [[occultism|occult]] and [[witchcraft]].
 
==Early life and career==
Farrar was born in [[Essex]] in 1916. He was raised as a [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]], but gave up the religion in favour of [[agnosticism]] at age twenty<ref name="mystica">{{cite web | title=Farrar, Janet (1950-) and Stewart (1916-2000) | work=www.themystica.com | url=http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/f/farrar_janet_and_stewart.html | accessdate=December 10 | accessyear=2005}} <!-- This is drawn from Guiley, Rosemary Ellen.

Farrar attended the [[City of London School]] boys' school, and graduated from [[University College, London]] in 1937 with a degree in [[journalism]].  In college, Farrar had served both as president of the London University Journalism Union and editor of the ''London Union Magazine''<ref name="mystica" />.  

In 1939, Farrar volunteered for service in the [[British Army]]<ref name="mystica" />.  He served as an instructor in [[Anti-aircraft gun]]nery  during World War II<ref name="mystica" />, and wrote an instruction manual for a [[Bofors]] gun<ref name="caliber">Knowles, ''Farrar'', gives the caliber of the gun as 30mm.  The well-known anti-aircraft [[Bofors gun]] was 40mm.</ref>.  After the war's end, Farrar, then a major, continued to work for the military in [[Germany]] as a civilian public relations and press officer for the [[Control Commission for Germany]]<ref name="mystica" />, liaison to the [[German Coal Board]].<ref name="knowles">{{cite web | title=Stewart Farrar (1916-2000) | work=Controversial.Com | author=George Knowles | url=http://www.controverscial.com/Stewart%20Farrar.htm | accessdate=December 10 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>  Farrar was one of the first British officers to enter [[Auschwitz]], an experience that Knowles claims "greatly influenced his personal and political beliefs"<ref name="knowles" />.

Farrar returned to England after 1947.  He began his career in journalism, and from 1953 to 1954 worked in London's [[Reuters]] office. In 1954, Farrar joined the [[British Communist Party]], and began reporting for the ''[[The Morning Star|Daily Worker]]''<ref name="mystica" />, but left both the party and the paper in protest over the [[Soviet]] response to the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]]<ref name="knowles" />.  For the six years following, Farrar worked for [[Associated British-Pathe]] and [[Thames Television|A. B. C. Television]] as a scriptwriter, and also did freelance work for the [[British Broadcasting Company]].  His writing for the BBC during the 1960's and 70's included the award-winning radio play "Watch the Wall my Darling", the children's television series "The Boy Merlin" and "Pity About the Abbey", a play for television which he co-wrote with poet [[John Betjeman]].

Farrar published his first novel in 1958, ''The Snake on 99''.  By the end of 1963 Farrar had published two more detective novels, ''Zero in the Gate'' and ''Death in the Wrong Bed''.  Farrar also wrote a [[romance novel]], ''Delphine, Be a Darling'', also published in 1963.

In 1969, Farrar was once again working as a journalist, employed by the weekly newspaper ''[[Reveille newspaper|Reveille]]''.  It was an assignment from this paper that would introduce Farrar to Wicca.

==Involvement in Wicca==
Farrar was sent by ''Reveille'' to a press screening of the film ''Legend of the Witches''.  The screening was also attended by [[Alex Sanders (pagan)|Alex Sanders]] and [[Maxine Sanders]], the founders of Alexandrian Wicca, who had served as advisors during the film's creation.  According to his biography at mystica.com, Farrar was "skeptical about Witchcraft but was interested in Sanders upon meeting him"<ref name="mystica" />.  The paper requested that Farrar interview Sanders and published the interview as a two-part story. Sanders, "impressed"<ref name="fb">{{cite web | title=Our Wiccan Origins | work=Wicca na hErin | author=Bone, Gavin and Farrar, Janet | url=http://www.wicca.utvinternet.com/origins.htm | accessdate=December 10 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> with the interview, invited Farrar to attend an Alexandrian Wiccan [[initiation]] ritual<ref name="mystica" />, and prompted Farrar to write an entire book on Wicca<ref name="fb" />. According to mystica.com, Farrar "found the ceremony both dignified and moving"<ref name="mystica" />.  Farrar began work on his first non-fiction book, ''[[What Witches Do]]'', and began taking classes on witchcraft from the Sanders'.  Maxine Sanders remembers Farrar as "a charming man, a sincere student with an active flexible mind"<ref name="maxine">{{cite web | title=Priestess of the Goddess: TWPT talks with Maxine Sanders | work=The Wiccan/Pagan Times | url=http://www.twpt.com/sanders.htm | accessdate=December 11 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>.  Maxine Sanders also notes that it was in response to Farrar's questions about how to describe their practice in his book that the Alexandrian tradition was named<ref name="maxine" />.

On [[February 21]] [[1970]] Farrar was initiated into Alexandrian Wicca and joined the Sanders' [[coven]].<ref name="Rabinovitch">{{cite book | author=Rabinovitch, Shelley and Lewis, James R. | title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism | pages=96-97 | publisher=Citadel Press | year=2004 | id=ISBN 0-8065-2407-3}}</ref>  Farrar met his future wife, then Janet Owen (thirty-four years his junior), in the coven.  [[Janet Farrar]] asserts that the couple were both elevated to the second degree "in an unoccupied house in [[Sydenham]]" by the Sanders on [[October 17]] [[1970]], and that they received the third, and final, degree of initiation in their flat [[April 24]] [[1971]]. Two of Janet and Stewart's coven - 'Don and Barbara' were present, as were the Sander's Coven.  Janet Farrar remembers the initiation well, as Maxine invoked Sekhmet to banish one of her covens members. She broke her flail during this banishing. Recently their 3rd Degree initiation has been disputed by some Alexandrian "revisionists"<ref name="fb" />, unware that Stewart Farrar kept an archive of all his correspondences with the Sanders and copies of both his own and the Sanders coven records which unequivocally prove that the initiation took place.  ''What Witches Do'' was published in 1971.  The book has been called "controversial" because of Farrar's assertion that Sanders should be "ranked above [[Gerald Gardner|Gerald B.Gardner]] and alongside of [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Eliphas Levi]] in terms of magical achievement"<ref name="mystica" />. Farrar later backed away from the assessment, although he did later state that he believed he'was both a charlatan and a genuine magician'. The relationship between Alex Sanders and Stewart Farrar became one of mutual respect after letters began to be exchanged between them in 1977. To quote Sanders (8th March 1997): 

“Your letters give off good vibrations of work and happiness.  I feel that all our growing pains concerning publicity and personalities of the Wicca, are beginning to bear fruit.  A few of us in the midst of many are beginning to establish the foundation (I mean the building itself) on the raw materials, to get the foundation stone in place”.

They remained in dialogue until Alex Sanders death in the late '80's.
  
Farrar and Owen had begun running their own coven in 1971, before their third degree initiation ceremony, and were [[handfasting|handfasted]] in 1972 and legally married in 1975<ref name="fb" />.  The ceremony was attended by Farrar's two daughters and two sons from three previous marriages - his marriage to Owen was his seventh.  The late 1970s saw the publication of several more novels by Farrar, all of which were occult-themed [[fantasy novel]]s or [[science fiction]].  Farrar left ''Reveille'' to pursue a full-time freelance writing career in 1974.  In 1976 the Farrars moved to [[Ireland]] to get away from the busy life of London<ref name="Rabinovitch" />. They lived in [[County Mayo]] and [[County Wicklow]], finally settling in "Herne Cottage" in [[Kells]], [[County Meath]]. Both husband and wife went on to publish a number of "classic" and "influential"<ref name="Rabinovitch" /> books on the Wiccan religion and on coven practises. Their 1981 ''[[Eight Sabbats for Witches]]'' included material the authors claimed to be from the Alexandrian tradition's [[Book of Shadows]]<ref name="es">{{cite book | author=Farrar, Janet and Stewart | title=Eight Sabbats for Witches, revised edition | publisher=Phoenix Publishing | year=1988 | id=ISBN 0-919345-26-3}}</ref>.  The Farrars, with the support of [[Doreen Valiente]], argued in the book that even though the publishing of this material broke their oath of secrecy, it was justified by the need to correct misinformation<ref name="es" />.  Janet Farrar indicates that some of the rituals contained in the couple's books were actually written by them, and that they left the Alexandrian tradition after the book's research was complete<ref name="fb" />.  The couple co-authored four more books on Wicca.

They were joined by [[Gavin Bone]], with whom they entered into a "[[polyfidelity|polyfidelitous relationship]]"<ref>{{cite web | title=Our Views | work=Wicca na hErin | author=Bone, Gavin and Farrar, Janet | url=http://www.wicca.utvinternet.com/view.htm | accessdate=December 10 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>. The three of them would co-author two more books; ''The Healing Craft'' and ''The Pagan Path'' (an investigation into the many varieties of Neopaganism).<ref>{{cite book | author=Farrar, Janet and Stewart, Bone, Gavin | title=The Pagan Path | publisher=Phoenix Publishing | year=1995 | id=ISBN 0-919345-40-9}}</ref>. In 1999 the Farrars received the [[Aquarian Tabernacle Church]] charter for Ireland, and were ordained as third level clergy.<ref name="Rabinovitch" />  Farrar died [[February 7]] [[2000]] after a brief illness.

A biography on Stewart Farrar entitled ''Writer on a Broomstick'' is to be released in 2008.{{fact|date=November 2007}}
