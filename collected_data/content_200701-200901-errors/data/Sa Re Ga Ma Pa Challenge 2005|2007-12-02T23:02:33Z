'''Hero Honda Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2005''' was a reality series, an extension of the famous [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]] programme that was first aired in [[1995]] on [[Zee TV]]. With the new "Challenge" series, Zee TV brought 48 potential singers that are living in [[India]]. 

==Synopsis==
===Elimination rounds===
The process started with elimination rounds by the four mentors: [[Aadesh Shrivastav]] (Baghban fame), [[Himesh Reshamiya]] (Tere Naam fame), [[Jatin-Lalit]] (Pehla Nasha fame) and [[Ismail Darbar]] (HDDCS fame). The mentors picked one girl and one boy amidst 4 boys and 4 girls who took part during the course of a month. Hence, 16 contestants out of the 48 were eliminated. The 32 remaining contestants consists of 16 boys and 16 girls.

There was only one contestant that was proven to be too good for this competition in the elimination round and that was Nihira. Her ''Challka Challka Re'' song was tremendous and won her the title of 'best singer of Challenge 2005'.

===Gharanas===
The 32 remaining contestants were later put into different ''Gharanas'' (or Groups). Each Gharana had to pick 8 contestants in total from the contestants selected through the auditions, elimination rounds and wildcard entries.

Aadesh Shrivastav's group was the Jai Ho Gharana, Himesh Reshimiyaa's group was the Lets Rock Gharana, Jatin Lalit's group was the Hum Mein Hain Dum Gharana and Ismail Durbar's group was the Yalgaar Ho Gharana. 

===Final 32===
From the final 32 round onwards, guest judges like Shiv, Hari, Pt. Jasraj, [[Alka Yagnik]], [[Jagjit Singh]] etc. were invited to comment and judge all the remaining contestants. Each week features a different judge.

Also, from this round onwards, the public was able to vote via SMS or by phone for their favourite singer. Each week, two contestants will be eliminated until the final round.
