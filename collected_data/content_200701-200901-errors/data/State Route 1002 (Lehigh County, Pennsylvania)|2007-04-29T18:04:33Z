'''State Route 1002''' ('''SR 1002''') is a 13.63&nbsp;[[mile]] (21.94&nbsp;[[Kilometers|km]]) long<ref name="length"/> [[List of State Routes in Pennsylvania|quadrant route]] in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]]. The designation of the route begins at [[Pennsylvania Route 100]] in the town of [[Fogelsville, Pennsylvania|Fogelsville]], east to the [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh]]-[[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton]] county line in the city of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/MAPS/Traffic/Traffic_Volume/2005/lehigh_2005_tv.pdf|title=Traffic map for Lehigh County|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref>

Built in the early 1920s<ref name="fed"/> and commissioned in 1960<ref name="lmap1960"/>, SR 1002 is sometimes referred to as '''Old Route 22''' because it used to be [[U.S. Route 22]] from 1926 to 1960.<ref name="lmap1941">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Lehigh_1941.pdf|title=1941 Lehigh County Map|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-09|work=[[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PennDOT]]}}</ref> From the western terminus to a bridge at the [[Lehigh River]], the first nine miles of the highway's length are known as '''Tilghman Street'''.

SR 1002 starts as Tilghman Street at Pennsylvania Route 100, where it continues as Main Street then Old Route 22. The speed limit on the street is 45 mph. Tilghman Street divides into a mini [[freeway]] when meeting U.S. Route 22. West-bound Tilghman Street is used only for U.S. Route 22 West. The east-bound of Tilghman Street uses U.S. Route 22 East. The same thing occurs for ramps coming off Route 22. Then, Tilghman Street turns local and there's an entrance to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] at [[Interstate 476]].<ref>{{cite map

From there, it crosses above the Pennsylvania Turnpike and then intersects with [[Pennsylvania Route 309]]. One mile east of that intersection, there is an intersection with [[Cedar Crest Boulevard]]. Then, Tilghman Street enters Allentown, where it crosses more than 30 major streets in the city.

Tilghman Street is a fast route in Allentown, where the traffic lights give cars on Tilghman Street substantially more time to cross.  Where Tilghman Street reaches the more populated part of the city, it intersects with [[Pennsylvania Route 145]], forming Allentownâ€™s 6th and 7th Streets. From there, it uses the Tilghman Street Bridge to cross the Jordan Creek and American Parkway that run below. It then reaches Front Street, where it crosses the second bridge and becomes Union Boulevard. Tilghman Street is still found in east-side Allentown, but it is not connected to the fast route the street uses in west-side and center city Allentown.<ref name="ABE map">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/OTM/2007/web_ABE_enlg.pdf|title=Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton Metropolitan Map|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-11|work=PennDOT}}</ref>

=== Union Boulevard ===
[[Image:Tilghman Street Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Tighman Street Viaduct was built in 1928 and meant to cross the [[Lehigh River]].]]
East of Front Street, the Tilghman Street designation of SR 1002 ends and becomes Union Boulevard while crossing the [[Lehigh River]] on a concrete span bridge called the Tilghman Street Viaduct. East of the bridge, the alignment of SR 1002 changes to the northeast while encountering numerous streets in the eastern section of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]. East of Dauphin Street, Union Boulevard is four lanes wide with a 35 mile per hour speed limit. After intersecting Fenwick Street, SR 1002 changes to a solid east alignment.

East of Fenwick Street, SR 1002 meets with Airport Road and Irving Street. Airport Road is the main road to [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]]. Briefly east of Airport Road, Union Boulevard narrows to two lanes, while traversing the other streets of east Allentown. After passing Club Avenue, SR 1002 has entered the city of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] from the west as West Union Boulevard. 1,500 feet east of Club Avenue, Eaton Avenue merges onto the SR 1002 designation. 

SR 1002 leaves Eaton Avenue to makes a 45 degree angle turn and continue as West Union Boulevard. East of the intersection with Pennsylvania Avenue, SR 1002 makes a wide turn to the south and makes another turn to continue eastward. <ref name="ABE map"/> East of 8th Avenue, SR 1002 interchanges with [[Pennsylvania Route 378|PA Route 378]]. Motorists on Union Boulevard rely on 3rd Avenue to get to PA 378 south. Closely east of PA 378, SR 1002 terminates while crossing the [[Monocacy Creek]] and leaving [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]]. The designation continues as W. Union Boulevard into the eastern sections of Bethlehem in [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]].<ref name="lmap2004">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Lehigh_2004.pdf|title=2004 Lehigh County Map|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-24|work=[[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PennDOT]]}}</ref>

==History==
=== Before U.S. Route 22 ===
In the begining of the [[Twentieth Century]], Pennsylvania's first Commissioner of Highways [[Joe Hunter|Joseph W. Hunter]] kept all records of the early highways and trails of [[Pennsylvania]]. Hunter was an advocate for a plan to improve the roads of the state. This plan would impact the funding for SR 1002 and all roads in Pennsylvania.  In the early 1900s, Pennsylvania developed the [[Pennsylvania State Route|Legislative Roads System]] to create a system of quadrant routes and place them in separate [[PennDOT|districts]] of the commonwealth.<ref name="archives">{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/DAM/rg/sd/r12sd.htm#constructionbureau|title=Department of Highways|work=Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission|accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref>

By the 1910s, [[Allentown (PA)|Allentown]] had a small system of streets and some highways that crossed the city. The system did not yet provided the roads Tighman Street or Union Boulevard.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Lehigh_1915.pdf|title=1915 Lehigh County Map|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-24|work=PennDOT}}</ref> On May 31, 1911, the '''Sproul Highway Act''' was signed to construct and reconstruct state highways and those bridges located on the highways. One purpose of the Sproul Highway Act was to limit the amount of money the state pays the county to pave and construct the roads.<ref name="archives"/>

===William Penn Highway===
From 1926 through the 1960s, SR 1002 was signed as [[U.S. Route 22 (Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 22]] for its entire length. US 22 was [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with the [[William Penn Highway]] from 1926 to 1930. Ideas to build a highway parallel to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and an alternative to the [[Lincoln Highway]] were introduced by 650 members of the William Penn Highway Association of Pennsylvania. <ref name="fed">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.htm|title=William Penn Highway: US 22 in Pennsylvania|work=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref>

On November 11, 1926, [[American Association of State Highway Officials|AASHO]] approved a numbering plan to determine where [[U.S. Route 22 (Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 22]] would be routed on the present alignment of SR 1002 and the rest of Pennsylvania. In 1923, [[Pennsylvania]] wanted to setup a system of trails to be concurrent with a Pennsylvania route number. Several examples appeared in the state such as the William Penn Highway signed as PA Route 3 and the Lincoln Highway as [[Pennsylvania Route 1|PA Route 1]]. Pennsylvania wanted to retain a single route number for its designated named trails.<ref name="fed"/>

Although Pennsylvania wanted to stay with the state highway system, AASHO disagreed with the commonwealth and wanted to setup the [[U.S. Highway System]] on the named trails such as the William Penn Highway. In 1927, AASHO wrote to each [[State highway]] department to request approval of the U.S. highway System. The 1927 issue of ''American Highways'' contained a log of all U.S. highways, including [[U.S. Route 22]]. By 1930, the William Penn Highway ran from [[Harrisburg, PA|Harrisburg]] to [[Allentown, PA|Allentown]]. Through the early 1930s, a new route was constructed between Allentown and Harrisburg and was used practically by traffic over the William Penn Highway.<ref name="fed"/> In the mid 1930s, traffic increased on US 22 through Allentown and the William Penn Highway was decommissioned. From 1930 to the present, U.S. Route 22 is nicknamed the William Penn Highway on several map products like [[Rand mcnally|Rand McNally]]<ref>{{cite map

</ref>, [[DeLorme]], and the [[PennDOT|Pennsylvania Tourism and Transportation Map]].<ref name="pamap"/>

=== 1941 to present ===
Through 1941, the old US 22 alignment was concurrent with [[U.S. Route 309]] and [[PA Route 29]] from 19th Street to the former southern terminus of [[PA Route 145]] in [[Allentown, PA|Allentown]]. The three routes were concurrent on Tilghman Street for a length of one mile. <ref name="Delorme"/> By 1941, [[Pennsylvania Route 987|PA Route 987]] and [[U.S. Route 222]] terminated at US 22 in Allentown.<ref name="lmap1941"/> 

Through the 1960s, a two lane freeway was constructed north of Tilghman Street in Allentown known as the [[Lehigh Valley Thruway]]. When the freeway was finished, US 22 was moved from the current SR 1002 designation to the Lehigh Valley Thruway concurrent with [[Interstate 78 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 78]].<ref name="fed"/> The change in the designation of US 22 led to the commission of SR 1002. By 1960, [[U.S. Route 309]] and [[PA Route 29]] passed through different towns and villages for most of their respective alignments and the highways were not concurrent with the former [[U.S. Route 22 (Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 22]] designation at Tighman Street in Allentown.<ref name="lmap1960">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Lehigh_1960.pdf|title=1960 Lehigh County Map|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-20|work=PennDOT}}</ref>

In 1987, the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] created the Local Referencing System to designate and define all roads in Pennsylvania. The system renumbered interstates, U.S. highways, state highways, and quadrant routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pahighways.com/state/LRS.pdf|title=Local Referencing System|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref>

=== Bridges ===
[[Image:SR 1002 (LC) bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The Tilghman Street Bridge over the Jordan Creek and American Parkway.]]
SR 1002 has four bridges in the desgination. In 1929, two concrete bridges were built near the intersection with Dauphin Street. The shortest bridge was east of Dauphin Street on Union Boulevard. The bridge passes over an abandoned railroad and the bridge is in good condition at the moment. The Tilghman Street Viaduct was the longest of the two bridges and was reconstructed in 1995. The bridge crosses the [[Lehigh River]] and the Corman Railroad at a length of 422 meters. The bridges averaged a daily traffic of 21,706 vehicles a day in 2004.<ref name="bridge">{{cite web|url=http://nationalbridges.com/|title=Bridge Facts|work=National Bridge Inventory Database|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>

In 1936, a concrete-arch bridge was built on Tilghman Street west of Cedar Crest Boulevard in [[South Whitehall Township, PA|South Whitehall Township]]. The bridge became the second unnamed bridge on SR 1002. With a length of 18 meters, it is the shortest bridge on SR 1002. Today, SR 1002 passes over the Little Cedar Creek and a local road on the bridge.<ref name="bridge"/>

The Tilghman Street Bridge was the most recent bridge and it was built in 1986. The bridge is a 213 meter long concrete structure over the [[Jordan Creek]] and American Parkway. In 2004, the bridge average 13,129 vehicles a day.<ref name="bridge"/>
