[[Image:Psi2.svg|thumb|150px|The [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[Psi (letter)|Psi]] is often used as a symbol of [[psychology]].]]

'''Clinical psychology''' is the application of [[psychology]] to prevent and relieve psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being. 

The term was introduced in a 1907 paper by the American psychologist [[Lightner Witmer]], who specifically defined it as the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change.<ref name="compass"/> The [[American Psychological Association]] offers a more comprehensive definition of clinical psychology:<ref name="apa1">American Psychological Association, Division 12, "[http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html About Clinical Psychology]"</ref>

:The field of Clinical Psychology integrates science, theory, and practice to understand, predict, and alleviate maladjustment, disability, and discomfort as well as to promote human adaptation, adjustment, and personal development. Clinical Psychology focuses on the intellectual, emotional, biological, psychological, social, and behavioral aspects of human functioning across the life span, in varying cultures, and at all socioeconomic levels.

Although different countries require various educational qualifications to practice clinical psychology, it has traditionally required a Doctorate degree—such as the [[PhD]] or [[PsyD]] in America<ref name="compass">Compass, B. & Gotlib, I. (2002). ''Introduction to Clinical Psychology.'' New York, NY : McGraw Hill. ISBN 0-07-012491-4</ref> or the DClinPsy in [[Britain]]—although the U.S. now has accredited [[Master's degree|Masters]]-level programs as well. U.S. licenses are determined by individual states, and generally reflect the level of education. While doctoral practitioners may qualify for the title of ''Psychologist'', common licenses open to Masters-level graduates include Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate. (LPA). 

Clinical psychology offers a wide range of activities, including research, psychological assessment, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name="brain">Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology : applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham : Nelson Thornes. ISBN 0174900589></ref> Central to clinical psychology is the practice of [[psychotherapy]], which is the practice of helping clients improve subjective well-being, mental health, and life functioning by changing distressing or detrimental thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. Although there are dozens of individual forms of psychotherapy, the three major forms include [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]] (developed from [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s [[Psychoanalysis]]), [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] (which arose from [[Carl Rogers|Roger's]] [[Person-centered psychotherapy|person-centered therapy]])—although the field has been moving toward an integration of these and other efficacious orientations. Clinical psychologists can work with individuals, couples, children, families, small groups, and communities.

==History==
[[Image:Witmer.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Lightner Witmer]], the father of clinical psychology.]]
Clinical psychology developed partly as a result of a need for additional clinicians to treat mental health problems, and partly as psychological science advanced to the stage where the fruits of psychological research could be applied in clinical settings. The modern field began with [[Lightner Witmer|Witmer's]] establishment of the first psychological clinic in 1896 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He also founded the first journal of clinical psychology, ''Psychological Clinic''.

Witmer's call for clinical involvement by psychologists was slow to gain acceptance, but by 1914 there were twenty-six more clinics in the United States. While Whitmer focused on individuals with intellectual deficits, others focused on those in mental distress, and clinical psychology was developing in mental hospitals as psychologists gained staff positions, often working alongside psychiatrists.

In the early 20th century, the psychoanalytic work of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Josef Breuer]] gave great impetus to psychological understandings of mental distress and disorder. However, clinical psychologists did not engage in psychotherapy—a practice that was limited to psychiatrists (i.e. those with a medical degree). Rather, they focused mostly on psychological assessment, and this aspect of early clinical psychology came fully into its own during [[World War I]] when the U.S. military required clinical psychologists to assess thousands of new soldiers.

It was not until 1917 that clinical psychologists began to organize under that name, when the American Association of Clinical Psychology was organized—eventually leading to the Section on Clinical Psychology of the American Psychological Association. This section certified clinical psychologists until 1927, but would not allow clinical psychologists full membership in APA.

Slow growth of the field continued in the 1930s as several scattered, applied psychological organizations in the U.S. formed an alliance under the American Association of Applied Psychology. This group became the primary forum for clinical and applied psychology in the U.S. until APA reorganized in 1945, creating the division of clinical psychology, today known as Division 12.

The assessment-only focus of clinical psychology changed during [[World War II]] when the military gave greater recognition to the condition they termed "shell shock" (now  called [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]] or PTSD). The need for treatment was such that military called upon clinical psychologists to assist.

After WWII, a similar problem was faced when tens of thousands of soldiers came home needing psychological care. To meet this challenge, the [[Veterans Administration]] made an enormous investment to set up programs to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists. As a consequence, the U.S. went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all PhDs in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology.<ref name="compass"/> As a result of this shift, a report was drafted in 1947 that led to the [[Scientist-Practitioner Model of Clinical Psychology|scientist/practitioner model of clinical psychology]], known today as the ''Boulder Model''. This model of graduate training maintained the science and research-oriented focus of the field while adding training in psychotherapy. Similar organizational and theoretical developments took place in other countries in the 1950s, and the number of clinical psychologists proliferated.

In 1973, the Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) degree was recognized by the Vail Conference on models of training in clinical psychology.<ref name="norcrosspsyd">Norcross, J. & Castle, P. (2002). [http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_171.asp Appreciating the PsyD: The Facts.] ''Eye on Psi Chi, 7(1),'' 22-26.</ref> At this conference, it was argued that the field of psychology had grown to a degree warranting training persons explicitly in the clinical practice of psychology. Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first pilot PsyD program was instituted at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1968, followed by [[Hahnemann University]] in 1970 (moved to [[Widener University]] in 1989) and [[Baylor University]] in 1971.<ref>Murray, Bridget. (2000). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed1.html The degree that almost wasn't: The PsyD comes of age]. ''Monitor on Psychology, 31(1).''</ref> PsyD programs now train about half of all clinical psychologists. 

Different waves of theory influenced the field after WWII. First Freudian and neo-freudian (or psychodynamic), then humanistic, and finally orientations founded in behaviorism and cognitivism, eventually leading to [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]]. More recently, orientations founded in [[transpersonal psychology]] are becoming more common. Clinical psychology has remained inclusive of an [[eclectic]] range of theoretical perspectives and practical methods.

==Training==
[[Image:Penn campus 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[University of Pennsylvania]] was the first to offer formal education in clinical psychology.]]
===Doctoral level training===
Clinical psychologists undergo many hours of postgraduate training—usually 4 to 6 years post-Bachelors—under supervision in order to gain demonstrable competence and experience. Today, in America, about half of the licensed psychologists are being trained in the [[Scientist-Practitioner Model of Clinical Psychology]] (PhD)—a model that emphasizes research and is usually housed in universities. The other half are being trained within a [[Psy.D.|Practitioner-Scholar Model of Clinical Psychology]] (PsyD), which has more focus on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law).<ref name="norcrosspsyd"/> Both models envision practicing Clinical Psychology in a research-based, scientifically valid manner. The [[American Psychological Association]], among many English-speaking psychological societies, supports both models and encourages accreditation of PhD and PsyD programs that meet its strict academic standards.<ref>APA. (2005). [http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/qrg_doctoral.html Guidelines and Principles for Accreditation of Programs in Professional Psychology: Quick Reference Guide to Doctoral Programs].</ref>

Doctorate (PhD and PsyD) programs usually involve some variation on the following 4 to 6 year, 90-unit curriculum:

:*Bases of behavior—biological, cognitive-affective, and cultural-social
:*Individual differences—personality, lifespan development, psychopathology
:*History and systems—development of psychological theories, practices, and scientific knowledge
:*Clinical practice—diagnostics, psychological assessment, psychotherapeutic interventions, psychopharmacology, ethical and legal issues
:* Clinical experience
:**Practicum—usually one or two years of working with clients under supervision in a clinical setting
:**Doctoral Internship—usually an intensive one or two year placement in a clinical setting
:* Dissertation—PhD programs usually require original quantitative empirical research, while PsyD dissertations often address qualitative research, theoretical scholarship, program evaluation or development, critical literature analysis, or clinical application and analysis
:*Specialized electives—many programs offer sets of elective courses for specializations, such as health, child, family, community, or neuropsychology
:* Personal psychotherapy—many programs require students to undertake a certain number of hours of personal psychotherapy (with a non-faculty therapist)

There are a number of U.S. schools offering accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a [[Masters degree]]. Such programs can range from 48 to 84 units, most often taking 2 to 3 years to complete post-Bachelors. Training usually emphasizes theory and treatment over research, quite often with a focus on school or couples and family counseling. Similar to doctoral programs, Masters-level students usually must fulfill time in a clinical practicum under supervision and undergo a minimum amount of personal psychotherapy.<ref>Antioch University. (2006). ''[http://www.antiochla.edu/programs_map_options.shtml Master of Arts in Psychology Program Options & Requirements].''</ref> While many graduates from Masters-level training go on to doctoral programs, a large number also go directly into practice—often as a [[Licensed Professional Counselor]] (LPC), Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT) or other similar license.<ref name="namp">Northamerican Association of Masters in Psychology. (2004). ''[http://www.enamp.org/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=4 Licensure Information]''.</ref>

===Training in Britain===
In the UK, clinical psychologists undertake a DClinPsy (or similar) which is a taught doctorate with both clinical and research components. This is a three-year full-time course, sponsored by the [[NHS]] (meaning that all trainees receive a salary) onto which entry is highly competitive. The minimum requirement for applying to the doctoral courses (which mostly operate through a central "clearing house" based at Leeds) is a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology approved by the [[British Psychological Society]] as confering Graduate Basis for Registration, or an approved conversion course, plus some form of experience, usually in either the National Health Service as an Assistant Psychologist or in academia as a Research Assistant. Previously the training required obtaining an MSc and/or MPhil degree, so unless the Clinical Psychologist had a PhD or has subsequently done a "top up doctorate", Clinical Psychologists who qualified in the UK before 1995 may not have the title Dr.<ref>Cheshire, K. & Pilgrim, D. (2004). ''A short introduction to clinical psychology.'' London ; Thousand Oaks, CA : Sage Publications. ISBN 076194768X</ref>

==Professional practice==
Clinical psychologists can offer a range of professional services, including:<ref name="compass"/>

:* Provide psychological treatment (psychotherapy)
:* Administer and interpret psychological assessment and testing
:* Conduct psychological research
:* Teaching
:* Development of prevention programs
:* Consultation (especially with schools and businesses)
:* Program administration
:* Provide expert testimony (forensics)

In practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Most clinical psychologists who engage in research and teaching do so within a college or university setting. Clinical psychologists may also choose to specialize in a particular field—common areas of specialization, some of which can earn board certification,<ref>American Board of Professional Psychology, [http://www.abpp.org/abpp_certification_specialties.htm Specialty Certification in Professional Psychology]</ref> include:

:* [[Mental illness|Specific disorders]] (e.g. [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], [[addiction]], [[Eating disorder|eating]], [[Sleep disorder|sleep]], [[Sexual dysfunction|sex]], [[depression]], [[anxiety]], or [[phobia]]s)
:* [[Clinical neuropsychology|Neuropsychological disorders]]
:* [[Child psychopathology|Child and adolescent]]
:* [[Family therapy|Family]] and [[relationship counseling]]
:* [[Health psychology|Health]]
:* [[Sport psychology|Sport]]
:* [[Forensic psychology|Forensic]]

===Comparison with other mental health professions===
====Psychiatry====
[[Image:Prozac.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Fluoxetine hydrochloride]], branded by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly]] as Prozac, is a common [[antidepressant]] [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] prescribed by [[psychiatrist]]s. There is a growing movement to give prescription privileges to qualified psychologists.]]
Although clinical psychologists and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] share the same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are medical doctors with four years of medical school and another four years of residency in a medical setting where they can often choose to specialize, such as working with children or people with specific conditions. Being medical doctors, they tend to use the [[medical model]] to assess psychological problems (i.e. those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and rely on [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic medications]] as the chief method of addressing them (although many also employ [[psychotherapy]] as well). Their medical training does give them an advantage in terms of being able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and [[EEG]]s, and may order brain imaging studies such as [[Computed tomography|CT]] or [[Computed tomography|CAT]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scanning.

Clinical psychologists do not usually prescribe medication, although there is a growing movement for psychologists to have limited prescribing privileges. Such privileges require additional, supervised training and education, and would mostly be limited to [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic medications]]. To date, qualified psychologists may prescribe psychotropic medications in [[Guam]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Louisiana]]. In general, however, when medication is warranted many psychologists will work in cooperation with psychiatrists so that clients get all their therapeutic needs met.<ref name="brain"/>

Unless a psychiatrist voluntarily chooses to get extra training, such as at a [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] institute, they will have less training in the theory and practice of psychotherapy than will a licensed clinical psychologist. Even though many psychiatrists do seek out such training, the majority of them increasingly focus on medication management, possibly because insurance tends to pay far more for this service than for psychotherapy.<ref name="webmd">Downs, Martin. (2005). "[http://www.webmd.com/content/article/112/110350.htm Psychology vs. Psychiatry: Which Is Better?]" WebMD.</ref> Further, psychologists tend to have more training in psychological assessment.

====Counseling psychology====
{{main|Counseling Psychology}}

Counseling generally involves helping people with what might be considered "normal" or "moderate" psychological problems, such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events.<ref name="brain"/><ref name="compass"/> As such, counseling psychologists often help people adjust to or cope with their environment or major events, although many also work with more serious problems as well. Clinical psychologists, by comparison, are trained to help with these kinds of issues but also more debilitating or chronic problems, such as forms of [[dementia]] or [[psychosis]]. Other differences include: there are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs, they are usually housed in departments of education (as opposed to psychology departments for clin-psy programs), counseling psychologists tend to conduct more vocational assessment and less projective or objective assessment, and they are more likely to work in public service or university clinics (compared with clinical psychologists who are more likely to work in hospitals or private practice).<ref>Norcross, John. (2000). [http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_73.asp Clinical versus counseling psychology: What's the diff?] ''Eye on Psi Chi, 5(1),'' 20-22.</ref> Despite these differences, there is considerable overlap between the two fields and distinctions between them continue to fade.

====School Psychology====
{{main|School psychology}}
School psychologists' primary concern is with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children within a scholastic environment. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning, often graduating with a post-Masters [[Educational Specialist|Educational Specialist Degree]] (EdS) or [[Doctor of Education]] (EdD) degree. Besides offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, school psychologists also evaluate school programs, provide cognitive assessment, help design prevention programs (e.g. reducing drops outs), and work with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically.<ref>Silva, Arlene. (2003). ''[http://www.nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx Who Are School Psychologists?]''. National Association of School Psychologists.</ref>

===Licensure===
The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Although each of the U.S. states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements:<ref name="ASPPB">{{cite web|url=http://www.asppb.org/|title=Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards|accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>
:#Graduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree
:#Completion of supervised clinical experience

</div>

Most states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license, which can be obtained though various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops.

Exact requirements vary by license and by state, and are commonly quite complex (see [http://www.bbs.ca.gov/lic-req2.htm] and [http://www.bbs.ca.gov/pdf/publications/mft_faq.pdf] for examples).

All U.S. state and Canada province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e. mental health law) examination and/or an oral examination.<ref name="ASPPB"/>

There are several licenses that allow one to practice clinical psychology in various forms, usually awarded in relation to one's educational degree.
* '''Psychologist.''' To practice with the title of Psychologist, in almost all cases a Doctorate degree is required (a PhD or PsyD in the U.S.). In addition to finishing 3 to 5 years of coursework, other requirements generally include finishing a dissertation, completing a pre-doc internship, fulfilling a certain number of supervised postdoctoral hours (usually taking 1 to 2 years), and passing the EPPP and any other provincial exams.<ref name="apa2">Kerewsky, Shoshana. (2000). ''[http://www.apa.org/apags/profdev/beyintrn.html Beyond Internship: Helpful Resources for Obtaining Licensure].''</ref>
* '''Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT).''' An MFT license requires a Doctorate or Masters degree (which usually takes 2 to 3 years after a Bachelors and includes an internship and sometimes completion of a thesis). In addition, it usually involves 2 years of post-degree clinical experience under supervision, and licensure requires passing a written exam, commonly the National Examination for Marriage and Family Therapists which is maintained by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. In addition, most state require an oral exam. MFTs, as the title implies, work mostly with families and couples, addressing a wide range of common psychological problems.<ref name="aamft">American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, ''[http://www.aamft.org/faqs/index_nm.asp Frequently Asked Questions on Marriage and Family Therapists]''</ref>
* '''Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC).''' Similar to the MFT, the [[Licensed Professional Counselor|LPC license]] requires a Masters or Doctorate degree, a minimum number of hours of supervised clinical experience in a pre-doc practicum, and the passing of the National Counselor Exam. Similar licenses are the Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor (LCPC), and Clinical Counselor in Mental Health (CCMH). In some states, after passing the exam, a temporary LPC license is awarded and the clinician may begin the normal 3000-hour supervised internship leading to the full license allowing for the practice as a counselor or psychotherapist, usually under the supervision of a licensed psychologist.<ref name="nbcc">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcc.org/|title=National Board for Certified Counselors|accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>
*'''Licensed Psychological Associate. (LPA)''' About twenty-six states offer a Masters-only license, a common one being the LPA, which allows for the therapist to either practice independently or (more commonly) under the supervision of a licensed psychologist, depending on the state.<ref name="namp"/> Common requirements are 2 to 4 years of post-Masters supervised clinical experience and passing a Psychological Associates Examination. Other titles for this level of licensing include Psychological Technician (Alabama), Psychological Assistant (California), Licensed Clinical Psychotherapist (Kansas), Licensed Psychological Practitioner (Minnesota), Licensed Behavioral Practitioner (Oklahoma), or Psychological Examiner (Tennessee).

In the UK at present many titles including "psychologist" are not protected, so the marker of an approved professional is either being "Chartered" which requires having your qualifications vetted by the [[British Psychological Society]] or the use of a protected term such as "clinical" "counselling" or "educational" psychologist. Statutory registration of all the mental health professions is planned in the near future due to lack of clarity for the public about who is sufficiently qualified to offer therapy. The title of Assistant Psychologist is used by a psychology graduate under the supervision of a qualified clinical psychologist, and the title Trainee Clinical Psychologist is used during the 3 year doctoral program.

==Assessment==
{{main|Psychological testing}}
[[Image:Rorschach_inkblot_test.gif|thumb|200px|Example of an inkblot used in the [[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach]] [[Projective test|projective]] [[personality test]]]]
An important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is psychological assessment, and there are indications that as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice.<ref name="groth">Groth-Marnat, G. (2003). ''Handbook of Psychological Assessment,'' 4th ed. Hoboken, NJ : John Wiley & Sons. ISBN 0-471-41979-6</ref> Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypotheses about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions rather than diagnoses.

There exists literally hundreds of various assessment tools, although only a few have been shown to have both high [[validity (psychometric)|validity]] (i.e., test actually measures what it claims to measure) and [[reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] (i.e., test is consistent—internally, over time, and regardless of administrator). These measures generally fall within one of several categories, including the following:
* '''Intelligence & achievement tests.''' These tests are designed to measure certain specific kinds of cognitive functioning (often referred to as [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]) in comparison to a norming-group. Commonly used today are the Weschler tests (the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS-III]] for adults, the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC-IV]] for children, and the [[Wechsler Individual Achievement Test|WIAT-II]] achievement test), the Woodcock-Johnson-III, and the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test|Stanford-Binet-5]]. These tests generally measure areas such as verbal skills (e.g. comprehension and vocabulary), memory (short and long term), attention span, arithmetic, and non-verbal performance (e.g. visual/spacial perception, hand-eye coordination, problem solving, and logical reasoning). These tests have been shown to accurately predict certain kinds of performance, especially scholastic.<ref name="groth"/>
*'''Personality tests.''' [[Personality test|Tests of personality]] aim to describe characteristic patterns of behavior, thoughts, and feelings that remain relatively stable throughout a person's lifetime. They generally fall within two categories: [[Objective test|objective]] (offering restricted, measured responses, such as yes/no, true/false, or a rating scale) and [[Projective test|projective]] (which allow a person to respond to ambiguous stimuli, presumably revealing non-conscious psychological dynamics). Typical objective tests used today are the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]], the [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory|Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III]], and the [[California Psychological Inventory]]. Common projective tests include the [[Rorschach inkblot test]] and the [[Thematic Apperception Test]].
*'''Neuropsychological tests.''' [[Neuropsychological tests]] consist of specifically designed tasks used to measure psychological functions known to be linked to a particular [[brain]] structure or pathway. They are typically used to assess impairment after an injury or illness known to affect [[neurocognitive]] functioning, or when used in research, to contrast neuropsychological abilities across experimental groups. Examples include the [[Stroop effect|Stroop test]], the [[Bender-Gestalt Test]], the Trail Making task, and finger tapping.
*'''Clinical observation.''' Clinical psychologists are also trained to gather data by observing behavior. The clinical interview is a vital part of assessment, even when using other formalized tools, which can employ either a structured or unstructured format. Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of communication. One common example of a formal interview is the [[mental status examination]], which is often used as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.<ref name="groth"/>

===Diagnostic impressions===
[[Image:DSM-IV.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]].]]
After assessment, clinical psychologists often provide a diagnostic impression. In the U.S., many psychologists use the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (the DSM version IV-TR)—especially when working with an [[HMO]] or [[insurance]] company—whereas many other countries are more likely to use the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]''. Both assume medical concepts and terms, and state that there are categorical disorders that can be diagnosed by set lists of criteria, which serves psychologists by providing a familiar frame of reference for discussing and understanding the clinical experience and for guiding treatment.<ref name="jablensky">Jablensky, Assen. (2005). Categories, dimensions and prototypes: Critical issues for psychiatric classification. ''Psychopathology, 38(4),'' 201</ref>

The DSM organizes psychological disorders in five axes:
# ''Axis I:'' Clinical disorders; Other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention
#*Typical disorders include autism, ADHD, dementia, substance abuse, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar, phobias, PTSD, amnesia, anorexia, insomnia, and adjustment disorder
# ''Axis II:'' Personality disorders (generally rigid and self-defeating traits that are persistent over time and affect day to day living)
#*Typical disorders include obsessive-compulsive PD, paranoid PD, borderline PD, and narcissistic PD. Mental retardation is also placed on Axis II.
# ''Axis III:'' medical conditions contributing to the disorder
# ''Axis IV:'' psychosocial and environmental factors contributing to the disorder
# ''Axis V:'' [[Global Assessment of Functioning]] (on a scale from 100 to 0)

The DSM uses the medical model and views psychological problems in terms of discrete illnesses that can be defined by a minimum set of criteria (such as presenting problems, intensity, behaviors, duration, onset, etc.). While convenient for prescribing medications, there is a growing awareness that this model is not the only way to understand psychological functioning and the various causes of mental distress. As such, there are many debates in the field regarding alternative methods of diagnosing psychological problems.

One such debate is the position of adopting a ''dimensional model'' in addition to the current categorical model. Although it is disadvantaged at the moment by a lack of an empirical metric for measuring change or establishing degrees of variation, a dimensional model, according to Jablensky (2005), would have several major advantages, including—addressing quantitative variation and shifts (between various disorders as well as between what is considered normal and pathological); dealing with the presence of multiple conditions; and a more constructive way of looking at otherwise 'sub-threshold' conditions.<ref name="jablensky"/>

Mundt and Backenstrass (2005) describe another variation they call the ''psychosocial model'', which they claim would be far more relevant for the practice of psychotherapy (as opposed to medicine).<ref>Mundt, Christoph & Backenstrass, Matthias. (2005). Psychotherapy and classification: Psychological, psychodynamic, and cognitive aspects. ''Psychopathology, 38(4),'' 219</ref> While the medical model of the DSM is based on assumptions of biology, stability of diagnosis, and objective traits, the psychosocial model is more psychological, intersubjective, and diagnostically flexible over the course of therapy. Like Jablensky, they also suggest that this model be used in conjunction with the medical model, both of which should only be used in the relevant contexts.

British clinical psychologists do not tend to diagnose, but rather use ''formulation''—an individualized map of the difficulties that the patient or client faces, encompassing predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating (maintaining) factors.<ref>Kinderman, P. and Lobban, F. (2000) Evolving formulations: Sharing complex information with clients. ''Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 28(3),'' 307-310</ref>

==Psychotherapy==
[[Image:Grouptherapy.jpg|right|frame|Clinical psychologists work with individuals, children, families, couples, or small groups.]]
{{main|Psychotherapy}}

The central intervention used by clinical psychologists is psychotherapy, which uses a wide range of techniques to change thoughts, feelings, or behaviors in service to enhancing subjective well-being, mental health, and life functioning. Generally speaking, psychotherapy involves a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking or behaving.

Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.<ref name="compass"/>
* Insight—emphasis is on gaining greater understanding of the motivations underlying one's thoughts and feelings (e.g. Psychodynamic therapy)
* Action—focus is on making changes in how one thinks and acts (e.g. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)
* In-session—interventions center on the hear-and-now interactions between client and therapist (e.g. Humanistic therapy)
* Out-session—although the importance of the relationship is recognized, therapy is geared towards helping the client make changes outside of the session (e.g. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy)

The methods used are also different in regards to the population being served as well as the context and nature of the problem. Therapy will look very different between, say, a traumatized child, a depressed but high-functioning adult, a group of people recovering from substance dependence, and a ward of the state suffering from terrifying delusions. Other elements that play a critical role in the process of psychotherapy include the environment, culture, age, cognitive functioning, motivation, and duration (i.e. brief or long-term therapy).

===The Big Three perspectives===
The field generally recognizes three major perspectives regarding the practice of clinical psychology: [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|Psychodynamic]], [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|Cognitive Behavioral]], and [[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic]] (while a growing debate exists about including the [[Transpersonal psychology|Transpersonal perspective]], which recognizes a spiritual dimension in psychological well-being).<ref>Keutzer, Carolin. (1984). Transpersonal psychotherapy: Reflections on the genre. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 15(6),'' 868</ref>

[[Image:Sigmund-Freud-1907.jpg|thumb|[[Sigmund Freud]], founder of [[Psychoanalysis]].]]
==== Psychodynamic====
{{main|Psychodynamic psychotherapy}}

The Psychodynamic perspective developed out of the [[Psychoanalysis]] of [[Sigmund Freud]]. The core object of Psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious conscious—to make the client aware of his or her own primal drives (namely those relating to sex and aggression) and the various [[Defense mechanisms|defenses]] used to keep them in check. The essential tools of the psychoanalytic process are the use of [[free association]] and an examination of the client's [[transference]] towards the therapist, defined as the tendency to take unconscious thoughts or emotions about a significant person (e.g. a parent) and "transfer" them onto another person.<ref name="gabbard">Gabbard, Glen. (2005). ''Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice'', 4th Ed. Washington, DC : American Psychiatric Press. ISBN 1-58562-185-4</ref>

Many theorists built upon Freud's fundamental ideas, including [[Anna Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Heinz Hartmann]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Ronald Fairbairn]], [[Otto Kernberg]], [[Melanie Klein]], [[Heinz Kohut]], [[Margaret Mahler]], [[David Rapaport]], [[Donald Winnicott]], and [[Harry Stack Sullivan]]. Major variations on Freudian psychoanalysis include [[Self Psychology]], [[Ego psychology|Ego Psychology]], and [[Object relations theory|Object Relations Theory]]. However, there are still common themes that appear within psychodynamic psychology (as the general perspective is now called, although psychoanalysis in its orthodox form is still practiced), including examination of transference and defenses, an appreciation of the power of the unconscious, and a focus on how early developments in childhood have shaped the client's current psychological state.<ref name="gabbard"/>

[[Image:Albert Ellis 2003 seated.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albert Ellis]], co-creator of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]].]]

====Cognitive Behavioral====
{{main|Cognitive behavioral therapy}}

In the 1950s and 1960s, theorists [[Albert Ellis]] and [[Aaron T. Beck]] independently began combining the perspectives of [[Cognitive psychology]] and [[Behaviorism]] to create Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Essentially, it is based on the idea that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) all interact together. In this hypothesis, certain thoughts or ways of interpreting the world (called ''schemas'') can cause emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of CBT is to discover the biased and irrational thinking that leads to emotional problems and to help the client take control over his or her thinking processes in such a way that will lead to increased well-being.<ref>Beck, A., Davis, D., and Freeman, A. (2007). ''Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders,'' 2nd Ed. New York : Guilford Press. ISBN 978-1-59385-476-8</ref> There are various approaches along the lines of CBT, such as [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] and [[Dialectical behavior therapy|Dialectic Behavior Therapy]], both of which have been shown to be effective in treating certain conditions, such as [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[phobia]]s.<ref>Lynch, Thomas and Robins, Clive. (1997). [http://www.dbtselfhelp.com/html/lynch_treatment.html Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder Using Dialectical Behavior Therapy]. ''The Journal, 8(1).''</ref>

[[Image:Carlrogers.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Rogers]], therapist who helped establish the [[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic]] perspective.]]

==== Humanistic====
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}
Humanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the [[Person-centered psychotherapy|Person-Centered Therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]] (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy). Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement—congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding. The aim of much humanistic therapy is to give a holistic description of the person. By using [[phenomenological|Phenomenology]], [[intersubjective|Intersubjectivity]] and first-person categories, the humanistic psychologist hopes to get a glimpse of the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality.<ref>Rowan, John. (2001). ''Ordinary Ecstasy : The Dialectics of Humanistic Psychology.'' London, UK : Brunner-Routledge. ISBN 0415236339</ref> This aspect of holism links up with another aim of humanistic psychology, which is to seek an integration of the whole person, also called ''self-actualization''. According to humanistic thinking, each individual person already has inbuilt potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.

===Other major therapeutic orientations===
There exists literally dozens of recognized schools or orientations of psychotherapy—the list below represents those that have been pivotal in the development of clinical psychology. Although they all have some typical set of techniques practitioners employ, they are generally better known for providing a framework of theory and philosophy that guides a therapist in his or her working with a client.
{{seealso|List of psychotherapies}}
====Systems or Family Therapy====
{{main|Family therapy}}

Systems or Family therapy works with couples and families, and emphasizes family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. The central focus tends to be on interpersonal dynamics, especially in terms of how change in one person will affect the entire system.<ref>Bitter, J. & Corey, G. (2001). "Family Systems Therapy" in Gerald Corey (ed.), ''Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy''. Belmost, CA : Brooks/Cole.''</ref> Therapy is therefore conducted with as many significant members of the "system" as possible. In this way, the psychologist will be able to assess and treat client issues within the broader context in which the clients live. There are several different views within Systems therapy depending on the general therapeutic orientation, all of which have somewhat different methodologies and goals. These can include improving communication, establishing healthy roles, creating alternative narratives, and addressing problematic behaviors.

[[Image:Victorfrankl.JPG|thumb|[[Victor Frankl]] was highly influential in the development of [[Existential therapy]].]]
====Existential====
{{main|Existential therapy}}

Existential psychotherapy postulates that people are largely free to choose who we are and how we interpret and interact with the world. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to accept responsibility for living. As such, it addresses fundamental issues of life—such as death, aloneness, and freedom—and therapy focuses on the development of a client’s relationship with these existential issues. The therapist emphasizes the client’s ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.<ref>Van Deurzen, Emmy. (2002). ''Existential Counseling & Psychotherapy in Practice.'' London; Thousand Oaks : Sage Publications. ISBN 0761962239</ref> Important writers in existential therapy include [[Rollo May]], [[Victor Frankl]], and [[Irvin Yalom]].

One influential form of Existential therapy is [[Gestalt Therapy]], primarily founded by [[Fritz Perls]] in the mid-20th century. It is well known for techniques designed to increase various kinds of self-awareness—the best-known perhaps being the [[empty chair technique]]—which are generally intended to explore resistance to authentic contact, resolve internal conflicts, and help the client complete "unfinished business".<ref name="woldt">Woldt, Ansel and Toman, Sarah. (2005). ''Gestalt Therapy: History, Theory, and Practice''. Thousand Oaks, CA. : Sage Publications. ISBN 0761927913</ref>

====Postmodern====
Postmodern psychology says that the experience of reality is a subjective construction built upon language, social context, and history, with no essential truths.<ref>Slife, B., Barlow, S. and Williams, R. (2001). ''Critical issues in psychotherapy : translating new ideas into practice.'' London : SAGE. ISBN 0761920803</ref> Since "mental illness" and "mental health" are not recognized as objective, definable realities, the postmodern psychologist instead sees the goal of therapy strictly as something constructed by the client and therapist.<ref>Blatner, Adam. (1997). [http://www.blatner.com/adam/level2/pmodpsy198.htm The Implications of Postmodernism for Psychotherapy]. ''Individual Psychology, 53(4),'' 476-482.</ref> Forms of postmodern psychotherapy include [[Narrative Therapy]], [[Solution focused brief therapy|Solution-Focused Therapy]], and [[Coherence Therapy]].

====Transpersonal====
{{main|Transpersonal psychology}}

Transpersonal therapy is a relatively new but rapidly growing orientation that places a stronger focus on the spiritual facet of human experience.<ref>Boorstein, Seymour. (1996). ''Transpersonal Psychotherapy.'' Albany : State University of New York Press. ISBN 0791428354</ref> Similar to Existential therapy, it is not a set of techniques so much as a willingness to help a client explore spirituality and/or transcendent states of consciousness. It also is concerned with helping clients achieve his or her highest potential. Important writers in this area include [[Ken Wilber]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Stanislav Grof]], [[John Welwood]], and [[David Brazier]].

===Integration===
{{main|Integrative Psychotherapy}}
In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as [[neuroscience]], [[genetics]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[psychopharmacology]]. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.<ref>Norcross, John and Goldfried, Marvin. (2005). The Future of Psychotherapy Integration: A Roundtable. ''Journal of Psychotherapy Integration, 15(4),'' 392</ref>

===Other perspectives===
====Multiculturalism====
Although the theoretical foundations of psychology are rooted in European culture, there is a growing recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration.<ref>La Roche, Martin. (2005). The cultural context and the psychotherapeutic process: Toward a culturally sensitive psychotherapy. ''Journal of Psychotherapy Integration, 15(2),'' 169–185</ref> Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of [[acculturation]] can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in psychotherapeutic theory and practice.<ref>Young, Mark. (2005). ''Learning the Art of Helping,'' 3rd ed. Ch. 4, "Helping Someone Who is Different." Upper Saddle River, NJ : Pearson Education. ISBN 013111753X</ref> As such, more psychologists and training programs are integrating knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.

====Positive Psychology====
[[Positive psychology]] is the scientific study of human happiness and well-being, which started to gain momentum in 1998 due to the call of [[Martin Seligman]], then president of the APA. The [[history of psychology]] shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing [[mental illness]] rather than mental wellness. Applied positive psychology's main focus, therefore, is to increase one's positive experience of life and ability to flourish by promoting such things as optimism about the future, a sense of flow in the present, and personal traits like courage, perseverance, and altrusism.<ref>Snyder, C. and Lopez, S. (2001). ''Handbook of Positive Psychology.'' New York ; Oxford : Oxford University Press. ISBN 0195135334</ref><ref>Linley, Alex, et al. (2006). Positive psychology: Past, present, and (possible) future. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology, 1(1),'' 3-16.</ref>

====Feminism====
[[Feminist therapy]] is an orientation arising from the disparity between the origin of most psychological theories (which have male authors) and the majority of people seeking counseling being female. It focuses on societal, cultural, and political causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. It openly encourages the client to participate in the world in a more social and political way.<ref>Hill, Marcia and Ballou, Mary. (2005). ''The foundation and future of feminist therapy.'' New York : Haworth Press. ISBN 0789002019</ref>

==Criticisms and controversies==
*Clinical Psychology is sometimes subject to the criticisms leveled at [[psychiatry]], for example by the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement. This may be the case, for example, when using categorical medical diagnoses such as in the [[DSM]]—which views the client as having an illness—an attitude that some see as demeaning or disempowering.
*Clinical Psychologists are sometimes criticized by psychiatrists for not having the same degree of training or knowledge in general medicine or in medication, or as not being as scientific. There has been controversy over attempts by clinical psychologists to obtain prescribing privileges.
*Although some research has offered evidence that most forms of therapy are equally effective, there remains much debate about the efficacy of various forms of treatment (especially [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] and [[Transpersonal]] therapies). This debate often extends into the comparison between therapy and medication.<ref>Lilienfeld, Scott and Lynn, Steven and Lohr, Jeffrey. (2002). ''Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology.'' New York : Guilford Press. ISBN 1572308281</ref>
*Alternatively, some methods have been criticized as overly-reductionistic, mechanical, and dehumanizing; for example those originating in [[behaviorism]].
