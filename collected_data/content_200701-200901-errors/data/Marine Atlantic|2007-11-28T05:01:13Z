'''Marine Atlantic Inc.''' (fr: '''Marine Atlantique''') is an independent [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Crown corporation]] offering [[ferry]] services between the provinces of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[Nova Scotia]].

Marine Atlantic's corporate headquarters are in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]].

==Current operations==

<u>'''Routes'''</u>

Marine Atlantic operates ferries across the [[Cabot Strait]] on two routes:

* [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port aux Basques]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]

* [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Argentia]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]

The 96 [[nautical mile]] Port aux Basques route is operated year-round and is mandated under Newfoundland's "Terms of Union" in the [[Constitution of Canada]].  This service was assumed by [[Canadian National Railway]] in [[1949]] from the [[Newfoundland Railway]] upon [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland's]] entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].

The 280 nautical mile Argentia route is operated seasonally during the summer months.  This service was established by CNR in [[1967]].

<u>'''Vessels'''</u>

Marine Atlantic owns and operates 3 Ro-Pax (roll-on, roll-off, passenger) vessels and 1 vessel dedicated for [[semi-trailer truck]]/containerized cargo traffic.

The [[MV Caribou|MV ''Caribou'']] and the [[MV Joseph and Clara Smallwood|MV ''Joseph and Clara Smallwood'']] are among the largest ferry vessels operating in [[North America]] and are among the largest icebreakers in the world.  Classed "100A1" by [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd's]] with an ice classification of "Northern Baltic 1A Super," these vessels have similar dimensions as medium-sized [[cruise ship]]s.  They are based on a unique Canadian hull-design called "Gulfspan", which permits the ships to slice through sea ice rather than riding up onto and crushing it as conventional icebreakers do.  Their dimensions are 27,000 registered [[Tonnage|tons]] and 179 metres long, carrying 1,200 passengers, 100 crew, and 370 automobile-equivalent vehicles.

The [[MV Leif Ericson|MV ''Leif Ericson'']] is the company's third passenger ferry, having been purchased in 2001.  Significantly smaller and a less-capable [[icebreaker]] than the ''Gulfspan'' vessels, this ferry's dimensions are 18,500 registered [[Tonnage|tons]] and 157 metres long, carrying 500 passengers, and 250 automobile-equivalent vehicles.

The [[MV Atlantic Freighter|MV ''Atlantic Freighter'']] is the company's dedicated freight and cargo vessel. It has a capacity of approximately 80 trailers.

==History==
Marine Atlantic was established in [[1986]] to take over the provision of ferry services in [[Atlantic Canada]] which had previously been operated by [[CN Marine]], a subsidiary of [[Canadian National Railway]].  Its headquarters were in [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]].

Extensive budget cuts by the [[Government of Canada]] during the latter part of the [[1990s]] led to a drastic downsizing of Marine Atlantic's operations, precipitated by the [[1997]] opening of the [[Confederation Bridge]] which replaced Marine Atlantic's most heavily used ferry service, the constitutionally-mandated ferry to [[Prince Edward Island]].

Later in 1997, the company transferred the operation of its [[Bay of Fundy]] and [[Gulf of Maine]] ferry services between [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]-[[Digby, Nova Scotia]] and [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]]-[[Bar Harbor, Maine]] to the private-sector company [[Bay Ferries Limited]], a subsidiary of [[Northumberland Ferries Limited]].

That year also saw Marine Atlantic remove itself from the provision of coastal ferry services in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] with the transfer of operations to the provincial government at the end of the [[1997]] shipping season.  This agreement was reached between the federal and provincial governments in exchange for federal funding to extend regional roads such as the [[Trans-Labrador Highway]] to service coastal communities.  These coastal ferry services had been initiated by the [[Newfoundland Railway]] and were assumed by [[Canadian National Railways]], following the province's entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in [[1949]], although they were not constitutionally mandated.

In [[1998]], the company moved its headquarters from Moncton to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], after briefly considering [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia]] and [[Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador]].

In late [[2004]] the federal government announced the appointment of a three-member committee tasked with examining future operations of Marine Atlantic.  One of the options that was reportedly considered included [[privatization]], however the subsequent report called for improved service through fleet renewal, lower fares, increased frequency of crossings, and moving the headquarters to Port aux Basques.

===Former operations===

<u>'''Routes'''</u>

From its inception in [[1986]] until [[1997]], Marine Atlantic operated the following routes:

*[[Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port aux Basques, NL]] along [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]'s remote South Coast serving [[Newfoundland outport|outports]] and larger centres such as [[Burgeo, Newfoundland and Labrador|Burgeo]] and [[Ramea, Newfoundland and Labrador|Ramea]] to [[Terrenceville, Newfoundland and Labrador|Terrenceville]]

*[[Lewisporte, Newfoundland and Labrador|Lewisporte, NL]], and [[St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Anthony, NL]] along the rugged [[Labrador]] coast serving [[Newfoundland outport|outports]] and larger centres such as [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] and [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Happy Valley-Goose Bay]] to [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]]

*[[Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island|Borden, PE]] to [[Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick|Cape Tormentine, NB]]

*[[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John NB]] to [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby, NS]]

*[[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth, NS]] to [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]], [[Maine]]
