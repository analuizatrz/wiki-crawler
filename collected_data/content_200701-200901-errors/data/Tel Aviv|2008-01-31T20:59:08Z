The city is governed by the Tel Aviv-Yafo municipality and the current mayor of Tel Aviv is [[Ron Huldai]].

Tel Aviv was originally founded in 1909 by Jewish immigrants as an alternative to expensive housing in the neighboring historic port city of [[Jaffa]] ({{lang-he|יפו}}, ''Yafo''; {{lang-ar|يافا}}, ''Yafa''), which has been populated for over 4,000 years and is thought to be the oldest [[port]] in the world. Development of Tel Aviv began in 1909, and it grew rapidly, eventually engulfing its [[Arab]]-majority neighbor, and the two towns were united into the municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo in 1950, two years after the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|establishment of the State of Israel]]. The city's [[Bauhaus]] architectured [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]] was developed by German Jews who came to the city during the [[Fifth Aliyah]]. It was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2003.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3777385.stm | title=Unesco celebrates Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-13 | date=2004-06-08 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>

Tel Aviv is today considered the center of Israel's international economy, and is the hub of the area popularly known as "[[Silicon Wadi]]". Many hi-tech firms have offices or research and development facilities in and around the city. Also important in Tel Aviv's economy is tourism and leisure due to its location, secular and open character, variety of museums, and beaches. The city is considered by many to be Israel's cultural capital and it hosts a large variety of music, theater and other cultural events and facilities.<ref name="GAWC">{{cite web| url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb57.html| title=Tel Aviv, Israel - A World City in Evolution: Urban Development at a Deadend of the Global Economy| author=B.A. Kipnis| publisher=Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network at [[Loughborough University]]| date=2001-10-08 | accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref>

==Etymology==

Many names were suggested for Tel Aviv upon its foundation including [[Herzliya]] after [[Theodor Herzl]] - a city by this name was founded in 1924, just north of Tel Aviv.<ref name="Economist">{{citeweb | url=http://www.economist.com/cities/findStory.cfm?city_id=TLV&folder=Facts-History | title=Economist City Guide-Tel Aviv | source=The Economist | accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> In 1910, Tel Aviv was decided on. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the name Tel Aviv translates as "Hill (''[[tell|tel]]'') of Spring (''aviv'')". This is the title given by [[Nahum Sokolow]] to his Hebrew translation of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s book ''Altneuland'' ([[German language|German]]: "[[The Old New Land]]"). There is an account that Sokolow came up with the name to allude to the destruction of the ancient Jewish state and its hoped-for restoration. ''Aviv'' means "spring" symbolizing renewal, and ''tel'' symbolizes the destruction of the ancient state, following not the usual Hebrew meaning of the word "tel", but its use in [[archaeology]], meaning "mound of accumulated ruins".<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/Telaviv.html | title=Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-18 | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref> Sokolow took the name from the [[Book of Ezekiel]] {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Ezekiel|chapter=3|verse=15|nobook=}} : "Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days." (The spelling in the [[King James Version of the Bible]] is ''Telabib''.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://king-james-bible.classic-literature.co.uk/the-book-of-the-prophet-ezekiel/ebook-page-03.asp | title=The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel | publisher=King James Bible | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>) 

Jaffa in Hebrew is ''Yafo'', which may be derived from ''yafah''/''yofi'', meaning "beautiful". Tradition holds that Jaffa was founded by and named after [[Japheth]], son of [[Noah]]. The city is also mentioned in the [[book of Jonah]], and, by the name of "Japo", on an ancient Egyptian tax register clay tablet found at Tel el-[[Amarna]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israelmybeloved.com/channel/israel_today/section/cities_towns | title=Cities & Towns:Israel Today | quote=The name Yafo comes from the name of Noah's son Japheth, or Yafet | accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.joppadesign.com/joppa.html | title=What does Joppa mean? | accessate=2007-07-18 | publisher=Joppa Design | quote=Joppa, meaning beautiful in Greek, was the word that seemed to fit.}}</ref>

== History ==
===Jaffa===
[[Image:TelAviv-Founding.jpg|thumb|Tel Aviv was founded on land purchased from Bedouins, north of the existing city of Jaffa. This photograph is of 1909 auction of the first lots.]]

{{further|[[Jaffa#History|Jaffa's history]]}}

The gulf of Jaffa has been the site of a fortified port town for at least 4000 years, and as such is the oldest port in the world. The city is first mentioned in letters dating from 1470 BCE which refer to its conquest by Egyptian [[Pharaoh]], [[Thutmose III]].<ref name="Economist" /> Biblically, Jaffa is where [[Jonah]] began the journey which ended in the belly of a whale, whilst the [[Book of Joshua]] mentions Jaffa as the territory of the [[Tribe of Dan]].<ref name="Economist" /> The city has since changed hands more than 20 times, and was destroyed by the [[Mamelukes]] in 1345 AD. In the 16th century, Jaffa fell under [[Ottoman]] rule and was destroyed by [[Napoleon]] in 1799.<ref name="Economist" />

During the mid-19th century, the city was seeing great prosperity due to trade with [[Europe]], especially in silk and [[Jaffa orange]]s.<ref name="Economist" /> As the gateway to [[Jerusalem]] many immigrants passed through the city, although few Jews lived there due to a rabbinical ban on Jewish settlement.<ref name="Economist" /> This was lifted in 1841, however and a small [[Sephardic]] community was joined from 1860 by more Sephardim from [[Morocco]] and by small numbers of European [[Ashkenazi]].<ref name="Economist" /> During the 1870s, the old city walls were destroyed due to increased security allowing for expansion.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/944906.html | title=Archaeological discoveries may prove barrier to Jaffa port rejuvenation | accessdate=2008-01-21 | date-2008-01-15 | source=Haaretz}}</ref> By 1882 Jaffa’s Jews numbered over 1,500, with the total population of the town growing from 2,500 in 1806 to 17,000 in 1886.<ref name="Economist" />

During the 1880s, the Ashkenazi immigration to Jaffa took off as the [[First Aliyah]] got under way. These new immigrants were different, with Zionism, not religion being their motivation, and Jaffa became a center for them.<ref name="Economist" /> In response to the crowded, expensive conditions of Jaffa, however, these immigrants began to create settlements in the sand dunes north of Jaffa’s rocky promontory.<ref name="Economist" /> Settlement in the area of modern southern Tel Aviv, the neighborhoods of [[Neve Tzedek]] (founded 1887), and Neve Shalom (founded 1897) began as a substitute for the relatively expensive Arab neighborhoods of Jaffa by some of the town's distinguished Jewish residents.<ref name="Economist" /> The neighborhoods were not much better in terms of conditions than Jaffa itself, however, and were scorned by many of Jaffa's Jewish residents.<ref name="Economist" />

===Tel Aviv is born===

The [[Second Aliyah]] brought further expansion to the Jewish community of Jaffa, with it Jews with a [[Zionist|nation-building]] mind-set.<ref name="Economist" /> A group of middle-class Jews, including some from Jaffa, founded a voluntary Homebuilders Society in 1906 to build a new Jewish [[:Category:Garden suburbs|garden suburb]] outside Jaffa.<ref name="JewishVL>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/geo/tahist.html | title=From Spring Hill to Independence | source:Jewish Virtual Library | accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref> [[Arthur Ruppin]], one of this group, said the new town would be a “Hebrew urban centre in a healthy environment, planned according to the rules of aesthetics and modern hygiene”.<ref name="Economist" /> In 1908 this group was renamed as ''Ahuzat Bayit'' (אחוזת בית; lit:Homestead), and five hectares of dunes northeast of Jaffa were purchased and divided into 60 plots. Another key member of this group was [[Meir Dizengoff]], who in 1911 was elected head of the local council and later, when Tel Aviv became a city, was elected its first mayor, serving in this post until the end of his life except for a short period between 1925 and 1928.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/BIOS/dizen.html | title=Dizengoff, Meir | source=Jewish Agency for Israel | accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book

Building commenced on 11 April, 1909, following the creation of a second housing association, ''Nachalat Binyamin'', when the members of the group held a picnic at the site and conducted a lottery to split the plots among them.<ref name="JewishVL">{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/geo/tahist.html | title=From Spring Hill to Independence | accessdate=2008-01-20 | source=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref><ref name="Economist" />  The Ahuzat Bayit association also admitted at this time, members of two suburbs previously established nearby.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israel.org/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Centenary%20of%20Zionism/Lexicon%20of%20Zionism | title=Lexicon of Zionism - Ahuzat Bayit | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}</ref> Within a year of the commencement of construction, [[Herzl]], Ahad Ha‘am, [[Judah Halevi]], [[Moshe Leib Lilienblum|Lilienblum]], and [[Rothschild Boulevard|Rothschild]] Streets had been laid out, with pipes having been laid for water, and the 66 houses (six of the plots had been subdivided) completed.<ref name="JewishVL" /> At the end of Herzl Street, a plot was allocated for a new building for the [[Herzliya Hebrew High School]] which was originally founded in Jaffa in 1906.<ref name="JewishVL" /> On May 21, 1910, the common name of Tel Aviv was adopted.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.akhlah.com/israel/cities/telaviv.php | title=Akhlah: Cities & Sites in Israel | quote="In 1910, the name was changed to Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref><ref name="JewishVL" /> At its founding, Tel Aviv was intended only to be a [[bedroom community]] of Jaffa.

===Mandatory period===
[[Image:Tel Aviv British mailboxes by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|British mailboxes in [[White City|old Tel Aviv]] are a remnant of the Mandate.]]
By 1914, Tel Aviv had grown to include over 100 hectares, making up several new neighborhoods. By now, the number of houses had tripled, and the population stood at 2,000.<ref name="JewishVL" /> However, growth was halted in 1917 when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities expelled its inhabitants as well as the Jewish inhabitants of Jaffa.<ref name="JewishVL" /> Following the British conquest, eight months later, the residents returned from the agricultural communities they had been staying on and resumed development.<ref name="JewishVL" /> 

The period of [[British Mandate of Palestine|British administration]] saw increasing political friction between Jews and Arabs throughout Palestine. May 1921 saw dozens of Jews being killed by an Arab mob in the [[Jaffa riots]] on May 1, yet the city gained town status on May 11.<ref name="JewishVL" />  As a result of the riots, many of the Jews of Jaffa moved north to Tel Aviv and by 1924 the population of Tel Aviv was 35,000, with most of the Jews having left Jaffa.<ref name="population">{{citeweb | url=http://www.travelnet.co.il/israel/TelAviv/History.htm | title=Tel Aviv History | accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref> Following the violence, the inhabitants of Tel Aviv created a new [[central business district]] which led to the decline of Jaffa which was now devoid of much of its commercial interests.<ref name="JewishVL" />  The [[Urban planning|master plan]] for development of the city, based on a framework of central routes and [[boulevard]]s, was designed in 1925 by [[Patrick Geddes]] and adopted by the city council under [[Meir Dizengoff]].<ref name="Economist" />

Tel Aviv continued to grow throughout the [[Fourth Aliyah]] (1926-1928), although the years between 1927 and 1930 saw a decrease in growth due to the economic slowdown in [[Poland]].<ref name="JewishVL" /><ref name="Economist" /> It wasn't all negative however, as cultural life of Tel Aviv was invigorated with the decision by the establishment of the Ohel theater and the decision by [[Habimah]] in 1931, to make Tel Aviv its permanent base.<ref name="JewishVL" /> Tel Aviv received official municipal status in 1934.<ref name="JewishVL" />

The population rose dramatically during the [[Fifth Aliyah]] after the rise to power of the [[Nazi]] party in [[Germany]].<ref name="JewishVL" /> Tel Aviv was home to 150,000, compared to Jaffa's 69,000 residents, by 1937, and two years later, the population of 160,000 was over a third of the total Jewish population of the country.<ref name="JewishVL" /> Owing to its proximity to the port of Jaffa, and its status as the first Jewish community that immigrants saw when coming into the country, Tel Aviv quickly grew to become the center of Israeli urban life, which it remains to this day. Due to the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936&ndash;1939 Arab rioting]], a local port was opened in 1938, which was an important milestone marking its independence from Jaffa, whilst [[Lod Airport]] (later Ben Gurion Airport) and [[Sde Dov Airport]] opened between 1937 and 1938.<ref name="Economist" />

Tel Aviv's [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]] was also developed between 1930 and 1939. Now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], the White City was built by a group of 17 architects trained at the [[Bauhaus]], the modernist architectural school which the Nazis closed in 1933, and relocated to Tel Aviv as part of the large immigration from Germany at this time.<ref name="Economist" /> The need for housing and the desire of this group to create a sense of the Europe they had left behind led to the formation of this unique area of Bauhaus style buildings.<ref name="Economist" /> In total, over 6,500 buildings in this style were constructed in the city.<ref name="Economist" />
[[Image:OldcityhallS.jpg|thumb|200px|Historic Tel Aviv town hall and [[Nahum Gutman]] fountain]]
According to the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|1947 UN Partition Plan]], Palestine was to be partitioned into Jewish and Arab states. Tel Aviv was to be part of the Jewish state, while Jaffa was to become an [[enclave]] belonging to the Arab state. By this time, Tel Aviv’s population was 230,000.<ref name="Economist" /> Between 1947 and 1948, the border between Tel Aviv and Jaffa was a flashpoint with Arab snipers firing from the minaret of a mosque with the [[Haganah]] and ''Irgun'' responded by besieging Jaffa.<ref name="Economist" /> The partician plan was rejected by the Arabs, however,  and violence erupted immediately. During an offensive on Jaffa that started in April 1948, many of its Arab residents [[Palestinian exodus|fled]] through the harbor. When Jaffa was taken on [[May 14]], only few of Jaffa’s 65,000 Arab residents remained.<ref name="Economist" />

===Modern times=== 
By 1948, and Israel's [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Declaration of Independence]] which took place in Tel Aviv on [[May 14]], [[1948]], the population of Tel Aviv had risen to over 200,000.<ref name="population" />
For the duration of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], Tel Aviv served as Israel's temporary capital because of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|Arab blockade of Jerusalem]], which was proclaimed capital in December 1949.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/SLSES/donors/eng_articles/index.html |title=Provisional capital of Israel | accessdate=2008-01-21 | soure=University of Maryland Libraries}}</ref> Because of the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most embassies stayed in the Tel Aviv area. In the early 1980s, 13 more returned there as part of the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478|UN's punitive measures]] responding to Israel's 1980 [[Jerusalem Law]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.icaj.nl/nieuwsbrief/sep2005/25_jaar_ambassade.htm | title=Vijfentwintig jaar Ambassade Wonderen | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1979-1980/119%20Foreign%20Ministry%20reaction%20to%20the%20transfer%20of%20t |title=Foreign Ministry reaction to the transfer of the Dutch embassy from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv | date=1980-08-26 |accessdate=2007-06-03 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |work=Israel's Foreign Relations: Selected Documents}}</ref> Today all but two of the international embassies to Israel are in Tel Aviv or the surrounding district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.science.co.il/Embassies.asp|title=Embassies and Consulates in Israel |accessdate=2007-07-18 |publisher=Israel Science and Technology|work=Israel Science and Technology Homepage}}</ref> In April 1949, Tel Aviv and Jaffa were united in the single municipality Tel Aviv-Yafo, and the lands of neighboring villages such as [[al-Shaykh Muwannis]], Jammasin and Sumail, which were depopulated during the war, were incorporated into the united municipality.<ref name="EJ">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Tel Aviv-Jaffa |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]}}</ref> Tel Aviv thus grew to {{convert|42|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us|1}}.

Over the past sixty years, Tel Aviv has developed into a [[secular]], liberal-minded city, vastly contrasting to [[Jerusalem]], less than one hour away.<ref name="Economist" /> Tel Aviv's nightlife and café culture are vibrant, and the city's [[Gay Pride]] and Love Parade marches characterise this.<ref name="Economist" /> A few events are of particular note since independence, however. In 1982, over 400,000 gathered in the Kings of Israel Square to protest against Israeli army complicity in the massacre of up to 2,000 Palestinian refugees in refugee camps in Beirut.<ref name="Economist" /> Thirteen years later, on November 4th 1995, at the same place, [[Yitzhak Rabin]], Israel’s prime minister at the time was assassinated at a rally in support of the Oslo peace accord, by a Jewish right-wing extremist. The square has since been renamed [[Rabin Square]].<ref name="Economist" />

====Terrorism====
Tel Aviv has suffered violence and terrorism at the hands of [[:Category:Palestinian militant groups|Palestinian militant groups]] over the course of several decades. The first [[suicide attack]] in Tel Aviv occurred on [[October 19]], [[1994]], when a [[Tel Aviv bus 5 massacre|suicide bomber exploded on the Line 5 bus]] killing himself and 21 civilians, as part of a [[Hamas]] suicide campaign. This was followed, on [[March 4]], [[1996]], when another [[Dizengoff Center massacre|suicide bomber exploded nearby at an ATM]] during [[Purim]] holiday festivities and killed 18 civilians. Оn [[June 1]], [[2001]], during the [[Second Intifada]], a suicide bomber exploded inside a nightclub called the [[Dolphinarium massacre|dolphi disco]], and 21 were killed and more than 100 were injured. On [[January 25]], [[2002]], [[Violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 2002#Total Death Toll in 2002: 385#January (death toll: 21)|20 were killed in a suicide attack]] near the old [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station|Central Bus Station]], and on [[January 5]], [[2003]], in two nearly simultaneous attacks, 23 were killed. On [[April 17]], [[2006]], 10 people were killed and dozens wounded in another suicide attack in the same location, with many of the victims in these attacks being foreign laborers.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.adl.org/Israel/israel_attacks.asp | title=Major Terrorist Attacks in Israel | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Anti-Defamation League}}</ref>

== Geography==
[[Image:Tel Aviv P5280003.JPG|Aerial view of Tel Aviv looking North West across to the Mediterranean|thumb]]

Tel Aviv is located around {{Coor dm|32|5|N|34|48|E|}} on the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain]], the [[Via Maris|historic land bridge]] between Europe, Africa, and Asia. Immediately north of the ancient port of Jaffa, Tel Aviv is situated on land which used to be sand dunes, and so has relatively poor soil fertility.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.madtchi.com/en/israel/telaviv/index.html |title=Tel Aviv |accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> It is now on flat land with no notable gradients and as such its most notable geographical features are the bluffs above the Mediterranean coastline and the [[Yarkon River]]'s mouth.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Aliyah/About+Israel/Cities/Tel+Aviv.htm | title=Tel Aviv | accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> In modern times, due to the expansion of Tel Aviv and the Gush Dan region in general, absolute borders between Tel Aviv and Jaffa, and between the city's neighborhoods do not exist. The city is located some 60 kilometers (37 mi) northwest of [[Jerusalem]], and some {{convert|90|km|mi|1|sp=us}} south of the northern port city of [[Haifa]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distances.html?n=676 | title=Cities located close to Tel Aviv | accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref>

===Climate===

Tel Aviv has a [[mediterranean climate]] (according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]) with hot summers, warm springs and autumns, and cool, rainy winters. Humidity tends to be high all year round, and rain usually occurs between October to May. In winter, temperatures seldom drop below 5&nbsp;°C and are more likely to be in the region of 10&nbsp;° to 15&nbsp;°C, while in summer the average is 26&nbsp;°C.

===Districts===
{{see|Neighborhoods of Tel Aviv}}
Tel Aviv is made up of nine districts which have formed naturally over the city's short history. The most notable of these is [[Jaffa]], the ancient port city out of which Tel Aviv grew. This area is traditionally made up demographically of a greater percentage of Arabs, but recent [[gentrification]] is finding them replaced by a young professional population. Similar processes are occurring in nearby [[Neve Tzedek]], the original Jewish neighborhood outside of Jaffa. [[Ramat Aviv]], a neighborhood in the northern part of the city largely made up of luxury apartments, is currently undergoing extensive expansion and is set to absorb the beachfront property of [[Sde Dov Airport]] after its decommissioning.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3420369,00.html | title=Tel Aviv airport to make way for luxury project | accessdate=2007-07-03 | date=2007-07-03 | author=Ofer Petersburg}}</ref>

Historically, there has been a demographic split between the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], [[European]], north of the city, including the neighborhood of [[Ramat Aviv]], and the southern, more [[Middle-Eastern]] neighborhoods including [[Neve Tzedek]] and [[Florentine, Tel Aviv|Florentine]]. Recently, however, the mass-gentrification of the city has caused the divide to reduce with real estate prices in the prices soaring.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://guides.travelchannel.com/tel-aviv/city-guides/district-guide | title=District Guide | accessdate=2008-01-26 | source=TravelChannel.com}}</ref>

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===

[[Image:106 Rothschild Boulevard by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Bauhaus architecture in the White City. The top section of this building was built later]]

Tel Aviv is perhaps most internationally known for its unique [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]]. This area of the city contains 2500 structures constructed in the [[Bauhaus]], or [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture. It was designated by [[UNESCO]] in July 2003 as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=1096 | title=White City of Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> These buildings were built largely between the 1930s and 1950s as the modernist art movement reached its apogee in Europe by many Jewish architects who had trained in the style in pre-Nazi era Germany. Tel Aviv now boasts the largest collection of such buildings anywhere in the world,<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.telaviv4fun.com/bauhaus.html| title=tel aviv bauhaus | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Gems in Israel}}</ref> which tie in with its [[Garden City]] styling and the city's many wide-boulevards. Lax zoning and preservation laws have been brought in in Tel Aviv to ensure that this area of architectural wealth is maintained. As such, laws state that should a person wish to build or renovate part of a building, they must renovate the entire building.

Tel Aviv has more recently become a hub of modern [[high-rise]] architecture due to astronomically high land values and the concurrent deterioration of many low-quality buildings constructed in the 1960s to cope with Israel's [[aliyah|mass-immigration]]. The [[Shalom Meir Tower|Shalom Tower]], Israel's first sky-skraper, opened in 1965, and was, until 1999, Israel's tallest building. The [[Azrieli Center]], a collection of three buildings, one square, one triangular, and one circular took over the position of being Israel's tallest building with the circular tower holding this title until 2001 and the completion of the [[Moshe Aviv Tower|City Gate Tower]] in nearby [[Ramat Gan]]. More recent additions to Tel Aviv's skyline include the [[Neve Tzedek Tower]], [[Tzameret Towers]], and the [[YOO Towers]], designed by [[Phillipe Stark]] and currently under construction.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=100280 | title=Tel Aviv-Yaffo Buildings | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Emporis}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[Image:Tel Aviv Great Synagogue.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Synagogue (Tel Aviv)|Great Synagogue of Tel Aviv]] in the 1930s]]

While Jerusalem is regarded as Israel's religious hub, Tel Aviv is perceived as a [[secular]], culturally open coastal city. Despite this, Tel Aviv has about 500 [[synagogue]]s, including the [[Great Synagogue (Tel Aviv)|Great Synagogue of Tel Aviv]], of which some 350 are active. Tel Aviv has a sizable Muslim population, especially in Jaffa, and contains a number of mosques. Furthermore, in part due to the many embassies and foreign diplomatic staff located in the Tel Aviv-Yafo area, the Christian Arab population of Yafo, and the increasing number of foreign workers from Eastern Europe, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, a number of churches have been established in and around the city.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.dailyjews.com/articles/482_holy_tel_aviv_tours.htm | title=Holy Tel Aviv tours | publisher=www.dailyjews.com | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

[[Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.|Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv]]'s football club (once Israeli champion, twice Israeli cup holder and twice Israeli Toto cup holder) is the only Israeli football team in the top division (''Ligat Ha'al'') that represents a neighborhood &ndash; ''Shechunat Hatikva'' ("The Hope Neighborhood") in Tel Aviv &ndash; and not a city.

Other football clubs which used to play in the top division were [[Shimshon Tel Aviv F.C.|Shimshon Tel Aviv]] and [[Beitar Tel Aviv F.C.|Beitar Tel Aviv]], which are now merged into one team ([[Beitar/Shimshon Tel Aviv F.C.|Beitar/Shimshon Tel Aviv]] that plays in the third division ([[Liga Artzit]])). [[Maccabi Jaffa F.C.|Maccabi Jaffa]] is another former first division team that currently plays in the lower divisions.

Tel Aviv is also the home of many other sports. Two [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs operate in Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv Rowing Club, which was established as early as 1935 on the banks of the Yarkon River, is the biggest rowing club in Israel.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.rowersalmanac.com/profiles/israel.asp | title=Rowers Almanac | accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> Meanwhile, the beaches of Tel Aviv provide arguably the most vibrant [[Matkot]] scene in the world.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.telaviv-insider.co.il/sports.php | title=Sports in the Tel-Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Tel Aviv Insider}}</ref>

The [[Israel Baseball League]] began its inaugural season in June 2007, with the [[Tel Aviv Lightning]] representing the city.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.stljewishlight.com/topstories/12348156495807.php | title=Israel Baseball League starts in June" | publisher=''[[St. Louis]] Jewish Light | accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>

===Media===

Tel Aviv is a hub for Israel's media with the three largest newspapers published here. Tabloid ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' has been Israel's most widely circulated newspaper since the 1970's, and is headquartered on Begin Road.<ref name="news">{{citeweb | url=http://www.abyznewslinks.com/israe.htm | title=Israel Newspapers | accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> ''[[Maariv]]'', Israel's second most popular tabloid is also published in the city, whilst ''[[Haaretz]]'', Israel's most popular broadsheet is based in the city.<ref name="news" /> Tel Aviv also acts as the base for other national press including the evening financial newspaper, ''[[Globes]]'', weekly newspaper, ''[[HaTzofe]]'', and daily newspaper, ''[[Makor Rishon]]''.<ref name="news" /> ''[[Iton Tel Aviv]]'' is a newspaper covering Tel Aviv, whilst Aurora is a Spanish language newspaper produced in the city.<ref name="news" /> More recently, the free daily ''[[Israel Post]]'' and ''[[Israeli (newspaper)|Israeli]]'' have been produced in the city. Whilst a number of radio stations cover the Tel Aviv area, ''Radio Tel Aviv'' is based in the city.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.mondotimes.com/1/world/il/235/4739 | title=Tel Aviv Israel news media | accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[Image:Azrieli Towers.jpg|thumb|[[Azrieli Center]] towers and mall]]
The economy of Tel Aviv has developed dramatically over the past decades, and as well as being Israel's economic capital, the bustling city has now been described as a flourishing technological center by [[Newsweek]] and a "miniature [[Los Angeles]]" by [[The Economist]].<ref name="Newsweek">Levy, Stephen & Matt Rees, "Focus on Technology: The Hot New Tech Cities"; ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[1998]]-[[11-09]] <!-- (online: 1998-11-04) "Massive immigration from Russia in the early '90s brought the country a flood of computer scientists with advanced theoretical knowledge." --></ref><ref name="Economist">{{citeweb | url=http://www.economist.com/cities/findStory.cfm?city_id=TLV&folder=Facts-Figures#Economic_profile | title=Tel Aviv City Guide | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher=The Economist}}</ref> Many computer scientists now live and work in Tel Aviv. Their numbers increased as a result of immigration from the former Soviet Union since the early 1990s. The city is considered by Newsweek to be one of the top 10 most technologically influential cities in the world. Actually, it is the [[metropolitan area]] (including satellite cities such as [[Herzlia]] and [[Petah Tikva]]) that contains much of Israel's high-tech muscle which has become known as [[Silicon Wadi]].<ref name="Newsweek" />

Historically, Tel Aviv struggled to find a niche role in the [[economy of Israel]]. The city's location on sand dunes was not suited for agricultural usage, and its sea shore poorly suited for [[port of Tel Aviv|a seaport]], a role assumed by nearby [[Haifa]] and [[Ashdod]]. The city slowly developed a reputation as a center for scientific and technical research. In 1974, [[Intel]] opened its first overseas research and development operation in Israel, and Tel Aviv finally emerged in the high-tech map in the 1990s following an economic boom.<ref name="Economist" />

Tel Aviv is home to the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], (TASE), Israel's only stock exchange, which in recent times has reached record heights,<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jun2007/gb20070621_251927.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business | title=Israel: A Hotbed of...Investment | publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] | date=2007-06-21 | accessdate=2007-07-07 | last=Sandler |first=Neal}}</ref> as well as many international headquarters of venture-capital firms, scientific research institutes, and high-tech companies. Having said this, there is some industry in the Tel Aviv area, and goods such as chemicals, textiles and food are exported from factories here.<ref name="Economist" /> Also important to the Tel Aviv economy is tourism, and people travel from around the world to this city not only because of the plethora of cultural sites which Israel can offer, but also because of its legendary nightlife, atmosphere, and architecture.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.thomsonfly.com/en/destination_3863.html | title=Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Thomsonfly}}</ref>

The Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC) at [[Loughborough University]]  constructed an inventory of [[world cities]] based upon their level of advanced producer services. The inventory includes Tel Aviv as having "strong evidence" of world city formation—the highest ranking for a Middle Eastern city with the exception of partly-European [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html | title=Inventory of World Cities | publisher=Loughborough University | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

Nine out of the fifteen Israeli [[billionaire]]s reside in Israel; of them, at least four live in Tel Aviv or its suburbs (according to [[Forbes]]).<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_The-Worlds-Billionaires_CountryOfCitizen_10.html | title=The World's Billionaires | accessdate=2007-07-07 | publisher=Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/81/biz_06israel_Israels-Richest_land.html | title=Israel's 40 Richest | date=2006-12-09 | accessdate=2007-07-07 | publisher=Forbes | author=Boaz Bin-Nun}}</ref> According to [[Mercer Human Resource Consulting|Mercer]], as of 2007, Tel Aviv is considered the most expensive city in the Middle East to live, and seventeenth most in the world. It falls just short of [[New York City]] and [[Dublin]] and right ahead of [[Rome]] and [[Vienna]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/15/pf/most_expensive_cities/index.htm?eref=rss_topstories | title=World's most expensive cities | publisher=CNNMoney | date=[[2007]]-[[06-18]] | accessdate=2007-06-18 | author=Sahadi, Jeanne}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.jhtml?idContent=1268475 | title=Worldwide Cost of Living Survey 2007 – city rankings | date=[[2007]]-[[06-18]] | publisher=Mercer HR Consulting | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
[[Image:Kirya bridge Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|Multimodal traffic in Tel Aviv: pedestrians, private cars, buses, trucks, taxis and train station]]

The Tel Aviv area acts as a hub on the national road network with many major routes passing or terminating here. The main road access route to Tel Aviv is the [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway (Highway 20)]], which runs along the eastern side of the city from north to south along the Ayalon River riverbed, dividing for the most part, Tel Aviv and [[Ramat Gan]]. Driving south on the Ayalon gives access to [[Highway 1 (Israel)|Highway 1]], leading to [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Within the city, the main routes are King George Street, [[Allenby Street]], [[Ibn Gabirol Street]], [[Dizengoff Street]], [[Rothschild Boulevard]] and in [[Jaffa]], Jerusalem Boulevard. Namir Road connects the city to [[Highway 2 (Israel)|Highway 2]], Israel's main North-South highway and Begin/Jabotinsky Road which provides access from the east, through Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Petah Tiqva. Tel Aviv suffers from increasing congestion, with approximately 500,000 commuter cars daily. In 2007, the Sadan Report recommended the introduction of a congestion charge similar to that of [[London]] in Tel Aviv, as well as other Israeli cities.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1198517321459 | title=Public transportation to be overhauled | accessdate=2008-01-27 | source=[[Jerusalem Post]] | date=2008-08-01 | author=Sharon Wrobel}}</ref> Tel Aviv municipality are trying to encourage the use of bicycles in the city, aiming to open 100 bicycle-rental stations in the city to serve the current 74 km of bicycle paths in the city which is planned to reach over 100 km by 2009.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1200572503247&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull | title=City wheels in bicycle rental plan | accessdate=2008-01-31 | date=2008-01-21}}</ref> 
[[Image:Littleuni 13.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway]] on Tel Aviv eastern border]]

Tel Aviv has four [[Israel Railways|train stations]] all located along the Ayalon Highway. The stops are from north to south: Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv Savidor Merkaz (Tel Aviv Central Train Station), Tel Aviv Hashalom (near [[David Azrieli|Azrieli]] Center shopping mall) and Tel Aviv Hahaganah (near the [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]]). It is estimated that over a million people use the train from the surrounding cities to Tel Aviv each month.
[[Image:BenGuArr.jpg|thumb|Ben Gurion International Airport]]

A light railway is planned for Tel Aviv, witht the first phase of the [[Tel Aviv Light Rail]], scheduled for completion by 2012. This is expected to improve public transportation in the city dramatically.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.subways.net/israel/telaviv.htm | title=Tel Aviv Subway (Planned) | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Subways.net}}</ref> It will serve the city and metropolitan area stretching to the cities of [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Kfar Saba]], [[Herzliya]] and [[Bat Yam]], serving the towns and cities in between, and easing the road network.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.nta.co.il/site/en/homepage.asp | title=Neta - Tel Aviv Light Rail | accessdate=2008-01-27}}</ref>

The [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]], a large central [[bus]] station, is located in the south of the city. The main bus network in Tel Aviv is operated by [[Dan Bus Company]] whilst the [[Egged Bus Cooperative]], the world's second-largest bus company, provides intercity transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/11/Facets%20of%20the%20Israeli%20Economy-%20Transportation |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |title=Facets of the Israeli Economy &ndash; Transportation |date=[[2001-11-01]] |last=Solomon |first=Shoshanna |accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref>

Tel Aviv's airport is [[Sde Dov Airport|Dov Hoz Airport]] ''Sde Dov'' which is located in the northwestern side of the city and serves as a major airport for domestic flights. Sde Dov is, however, slated to close, as the land it is constructed on is prime coastal real estate in the upscale [[Ramat Aviv]] neighborhood.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/793988.html | title=Sde Dov to be vacated, state gets half of Big Bloc | accessdate=2007-07-17 | publisher=Haaretz| last=Bar-Eli |first=Avi| date=[[2006-11-30]]}}</ref> As such, sometime in the near future, all services to Sde Dov will transfer to [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], Israel's main international airport, which is located 15&nbsp;kilometers southeast of Tel Aviv, close to the city of [[Lod]]. Because of its proximity to Tel Aviv and its location within the metropolitan area of Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport is often referred to as ''Tel Aviv International Airport'' despite the fact that the airport is not included in any municipal jurisdiction.

In early 2008, Tel Aviv Municipality announced a pilot scheme in which charging points for electric cars will be built and set up across the city. Initially, five charging points will be built and eventually 150 points will be located across the city. Furthermore, battery replacement points will be located at the city's entrances. The plans come under Israeli electric car project [[Project Better Place|Better Place]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000299280&fid=942 | title=Tel Aviv commits to electric car | accessdate=2008-01-17 | date=2008-01-17 | publisher= Globes}}</ref>
