'''Saku Antero Koivu''' (born [[November 23]], [[1974]] in [[Turku]], [[Finland]]) is a [[professional]] [[ice hockey]] player, and plays centre for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] as the [[Montreal Canadiens#Team Captains|current team captain]]. His brother [[Mikko Koivu]] plays for [[Minnesota Wild]].

==Playing career==
===SM-liiga and NHL===
Koivu started his professional ice hockey career playing for [[TPS (ice hockey)|TPS]] in the Finnish [[SM-liiga]], in the [[1992]]&ndash;[[1993]] season. He spent three seasons with TPS, winning two Finnish championships with the team in [[1993]] and 1995, and being elected [[Kultainen kypärä|Player of the Year]] by his fellow players in the [[1994]]&ndash;[[1995]] season. He was drafted by the [[Montreal Canadiens|Canadiens]] in the [[1993 NHL Entry Draft]] as their first-round selection (21st overall), and moved to [[North America]] for the [[1995-96 NHL season|1995-96 season]].

In his first year, Koivu ranked 4th in scoring amongst NHL rookies. The following season Koivu was the NHL leading scorer (13 goals, 25 assists and 38 points) before suffering a knee injury on [[December 7]], [[1996]] in a game against [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. He missed 22 games in that season but still scoring over a point per game (56 points in 50 games).

On [[September 30]], [[1999]] Koivu was named the 27th captain of the Montreal Canadiens, and the first European-born captain in the history of the Canadiens.

After six seasons in the NHL,  Koivu was diagnosed with [[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] in September 2001 and missed practically the entire [[2001-02 NHL season]]. He made an amazing recovery and was able to return for the playoffs, leading the Canadiens to an unlikely first-round upset of the number one-ranked [[Boston Bruins]]. For his courage and off-ice team leadership while undergoing cancer treatment, he was awarded the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]] following the 2002 playoffs. He followed up in the [[2002-03 NHL season]] by scoring his career best single-season point total with 71 (21 goals, 50 assists) to that date.

During the [[2004-05 NHL lockout]], Koivu returned to Finland to play for TPS, whose head coach at the time was his father, [[Jukka Koivu]]. He was joined in Turku by then-fellow Montreal Canadien, and close friend, [[Craig Rivet]]. 

The [[2006-07 NHL season]] was Koivu's seventh season as the Canadiens captain. His continued tenure seems to have ended a supposed curse of Habs captains. During a ten-year span from 1989 to 1999, six captains were traded away.

The 2006-07 NHL season was for Saku Koivu, personally successful. In a game on January 9, 2007, in which the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Atlanta Thrashers 4-2, he registered his 500th NHL point. With 2:47 remaining, Koivu fed Michael Ryder with a pass across the slot for a power-play goal. Koivu received a standing ovation from the sellout crowd of 21,273 in Montreal.
Koivu went on to score 22 goals and 53 assists in 81 games, totaling 75 points, making 2006-07 his best season. At the season's annual awards banquet, Koivu was announced as the winner of the King Clancy Trophy for his role in the cancer-fighting Saku Koivu Foundation. The Canadiens' team doctor, Dr. David Mulder, received the award on Koivu's behalf as he wasn't present.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDNHCcPfegk]</ref>

In October 2007, Koivu was criticized by nationalist lawyer [[Guy Bertrand]] for not speaking [[French language|French]] in a videotaped pre-game ceremony. Although Koivu is fluent in [[English language|English]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he speaks limited French and is shy about using it in public.<ref>[http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=221933&hubname=nhl]</ref> He replied to Bertrand's remarks that he is not perfect, and jokingly mentioned that he speaks French to his wife during intimate moments.<ref>[http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=221847&hubname=nhl]</ref> Koivu introduced his team in the next pre-game video with the phrase "Ici Saku Koivu, voici mon équipe" ("Saku Koivu here, this is my team").<ref>[http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=221933&hubname=nhl]</ref>

===Battle against cancer===

On [[September 6]], [[2001]], Koivu was diagnosed with [[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] after having serious pains in stomach and vomiting. Koivu was on his way back from Finland with then-fellow Canadien [[Brian Savage]] who said he looked pale and not well at all.<ref> [http://www.hockeyfights.com/articles/82]</ref> He went to see the Canadien's physician David Mulder, who did tests on him. Later it was discovered that Koivu had [[cancer]].

During this rough time, Koivu received vast amounts of get-well [[e-mail]]s and letters.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/magazine/assael_20020320.html]</ref> He was also in touch with [[Mario Lemieux]], [[John Cullen]] and [[Lance Armstrong]], all athletes, who had beat cancer and returned to top. 

Koivu was expected to be out for the season but made a remarkable comeback for the end of the season. He received a warm welcome from the Canadiens fans in his first match after he had beat the cancer.<ref> [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS9dbVL7PKk]</ref> Koivu helped the team to gain a playoff spot and they went on to beat the #1 ranked [[Boston Bruins]] in six games.

===Eye injury===

On [[April 26]], 2006, during a home playoff game against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], Koivu sustained a serious injury to his left eye. Hurricanes forward [[Justin Williams]] attempted to lift Koivu's stick and struck him in the eye. "The Canadiens were dumbfounded to learn that no penalty was called as officials failed to witness the play."<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/stanleycup2006/storyview.html?/story/stanleycup2006/national/2006/04/27/Sports/koivu-eye-injury060427.html]</ref> Koivu was rushed to the hospital where he would remain overnight and for the remainder of the playoffs. Without Koivu, the Montreal Canadiens went on to lose the series and their chances at a Stanley Cup championship. Williams, as a teammate of [[Mark Recchi]] (who played alongside Koivu as a Canadien), attempted to contact Koivu to apologize personally, but was only able to leave him a message on his cell phone.<ref>[http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=163995&hubname=nhl-canadiens]</ref> Koivu would remain out of the lineup for the rest of the series and underwent surgery to repair a detached retina in the off-season. 

Koivu has admitted to losing some degree of peripheral vision out of the injured eye which he will likely never regain. As well, a small [[cataract]] developed following the retinal re-attachment surgery that has now been successfully removed.<ref>[http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=207787&hubname=nhl-canadiens]</ref> Saku waited until the conclusion of the 2006-2007 NHL season before opting to have the surgery. A contact lens was worn to try to counteract the cataract's effects.<ref>[http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=177479&hubname=nhl-canadiens]</ref> Koivu also opted to wear a larger style of visor than he had previously worn.

Koivu's play has demonstrated that he can still complement linemates [[Christopher Higgins|Chris Higgins]] and [[Michael Ryder]] with seemingly no adverse impact to his performance.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/story/sports/national/2006/09/05/koivu-canadiens-eye-injury.html]</ref> In fact, in the 2006-2007 season he was able to beat his career high 71 points with 75, making the season after his eye injury the best of his career.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=1341]</ref> Koivu attributes his increased scoring this year to developing a quicker release of the puck, rather than anything to do with his eye injury or other subsequent changes to his play style thereafter.<ref> [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/sports/story.html?id=206439b8-bb05-40f9-9f2f-aabe542e4c45&k=50735]</ref> In the summer of 2007 he underwent eye surgery to improve his vision.

===International===
Koivu has represented [[Finnish national men's ice hockey team|Team Finland]] on several occasions and is the national team's captain. Koivu was named the successor of a long-time captain [[Timo Jutila]] after he retired from international play in 1997. Koivu's first duty came in 1998 when the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympics]] took place in Nagano. He has held the post ever since.

Most recently, Koivu won a silver medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] [[Winter Olympics]], and bronze medals at the [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]] [[Winter Olympics]]. He was also on the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey|2004]] [[World Cup of Hockey|World Cup]] team, which advanced to the final but lost against [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Canada]], thereby winning the silver medal.

Koivu's most renowned achievement with Team Finland is as first line center in the [[1995]] [[Ice Hockey World Championships#IIHF World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], where [[Finland]] won its only [[IIHF]] men's gold medal to date. Koivu played in the first line with [[Jere Lehtinen]] and [[Ville Peltonen]] (the "Huey, Dewey, and Louie" line <ref>[http://www.iihf.com/news/OG06/torino1097.htm]</ref>), who were all selected as tournament all-stars.

Koivu is partnered with [[Teemu Selänne]] and [[Jere Lehtinen]] in a line if all three are available. The trio has been a key factor to Finland's success at bigger events. However, Koivu and Selänne have played numerous times without Lehtinen and have had great performances which have also affected the NHL; after 1999 World Championships Selänne said in an interview on a Finnish TV program: "It would be great to play with Saku" which led to rumours about Koivu being traded to Anaheim.

On [[February 23]], [[2006]], Koivu was elected by his fellow Olympic competitors as a member of the Athletes' Commission of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]].
