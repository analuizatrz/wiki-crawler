The '''Olympic Games''' is an international [[multi-sport event]] established for both summer and winter games.  There have been two generations of the Olympic Games; the first were the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] ({{lang-el|Ολυμπιακοί Αγώνες}}; {{Audio-IPA|Ell-Olympiakoi Agones.ogg|[''Olympiakoi Agones'']}}) held at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Greece]].  The second, known as the Modern Olympic Games, were first revived with a modern international Olympic Games held in 1859 in [[Athens]], Greece. The first modern international was sponsored by the Greek philanthropist [[Evangelos Zappas|Evangelis Zappas]] and pre-dates the foundation of the [[International Olympic Committee]]. The modern Olympics feature the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Games]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]].  The [[Paralympic Games|Paralympic]] and [[Youth Olympic Games]] are variations on the Modern Olympic Movement.

The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) was founded in 1894 on the initiative of a [[France|French]] nobleman, [[Pierre de Coubertin|Pierre Frédy, Baron de Coubertin]].  His vision was to bring together amateur athletes from around the world to compete in a variety of events.  The IOC has become the governing body of the "Olympic Movement," a conglomeration of sporting federations that are responsible for the organization of the Games.  The evolution of the Olympic Movement has forced the IOC to change Coubertin's time&ndash;honored ideals.  The original vision of the pure amateur athlete had to change under the pressure of corporate sponsorships and political regimes intent on the creation of sports "dynasties".

Participation in the Games has increased to the point that nearly every nation on earth is represented.  This growth has created numerous challenges; including political [[boycott]]s, the use of performance enhancing drugs, bribery of officials, and [[Munich massacre|terrorism]].  While the Olympic Movement is forced to address issues never before conceived by Coubertin, the Olympics continue to grow in the face of these challenges.  The Games encompass many rituals and symbols that were established during their infancy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Most of these traditions are displayed in the opening and closing ceremonies, and the medal presentations.  Despite the complexity of the current modern Games, the focus remains on the Olympic motto: [[Olympic motto|Citius Altius Fortius]] - Faster, Higher, Stronger.

{{main|Ancient Olympic Games}}

There are many myths surrounding the origin of the ancient Olympic Games; the most popular of which identifies [[Heracles]] and his father [[Zeus]] as the progenitors of the Games. According to the legend, Zeus held sporting events in honor of his defeat of [[Cronus]], and succession to the throne of heaven. Heracles, being his eldest son, defeated his brothers in a running race and was crowned with a wreath of wild olive branches. It is Heracles who first called the games Olympic, and established the custom of holding them every 4&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pausanias|title=Elis 1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Aabo%3Atlg%2C0525%2C001&query=5%3A7%3A7|work=Perseus|publisher|Tufts University Press|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref> The legend diverges at this point. One popular story claims that after Heracles completed his [[12 labors]], he went on to build the Olympic stadium and surrounding buildings as an honor to Zeus. After the stadium was complete, he walked in a straight line for 200&nbsp;strides and called this distance a "[[stadion]]" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: στάδιον, [[Latin]]: ''stadium'', "stage"), which later also became a unit of distance. Another myth associates the first Games with the ancient Greek concept of Olympic truce (ἐκεχειρία, ''ekecheiria''). The most widely held estimate for the inception of the Ancient Olympics is 776&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marks|first=Tracy|title=The Ancient Olympics, Their Origin in Greek Mythology and Religion|publisher=Webwinds.com|date=2002-01-05|url=http://www.webwinds.com/thalassa/olympics.htm |accessdate=2008-09-11}}</ref>

From then on, the Olympic Games quickly became very important throughout ancient Greece.  They reached their zenith in the 6th and 5th&nbsp;centuries BC. The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance.  They featured sport events and ritual sacrifices honoring both Zeus (whose [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|colossal statue]] stood at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]), and [[Pelops]], divine hero and mythical king of Olympia.  Pelops was famous for his legendary chariot races with [[Oenomaus|King Oenomaus]] of [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisatis]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=David C. |title=The Modern Olympics: A Struggle for Revival |publisher=John Hopkins University|location= Baltimore  Press|year=1996 |isbn=0-801-87207-3}}</ref> The number of events increased to twenty and the celebration spanned several days. Winners of the events were admired and immortalized in poems and statues.<ref name="Ancient Gods IOC">{{cite web |title = Ancient Olympic Games- Gods|publisher = The International Olympic Committee|url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/gods_uk.asp  |accessdate = 2008-09-11}}</ref> The Games were held every four years, known as an [[Olympiad]]. The Greeks used Olympiads as one of their units of time measurement. 

The Games enjoyed immense success.  Victors were treated as conquering heroes, their statues adorned Athens and their home towns.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Ancient Olympic Games|last=Swaddling|first=Judith|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=90-93|year=1999|isbn=0292777515|accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref>  Gradually though, the Games began to declined in importance as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] gained power and influence in Greece. In 393&nbsp;AD Emperor [[Theodosius I]] proclaimed Christianity the religion of the Empire. After over 1000 years in existence, the Olympic Games were banned due to their roots in [[paganism]]. <ref name="Ancient IOC">{{cite web |title = The Ancient Olympic Games|publisher = The International Olympic Committee|url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp |accessdate = 2008-09-11}}</ref> The Olympics were not seen again until their rebirth 1,500&nbsp;years later.

== Revival of the Modern Games == 
=== Forerunners ===
{{see|Cotswold Games|Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games}}

Although the revival of the Olympic Games began in the mid&ndash;19th&nbsp;Century; multi&ndash;sport events with titles such as "Olympick" or "Olympian" Games had been held as far back as the 16th Century.<ref name=cotswold>{{cite web |title=Origin of Robert Dover's Games|publisher=Robert Dover's Cotswold Olimpicks|url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=862|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>  These events included an Olympick Games that convened for several years at [[Chipping Campden]] in the English [[Cotswolds]].  The present day [[Cotswold Games]] trace their origin to this festival.<ref name=cotswold/>  Another example of European attempts to emulate the Olympic Games was a European Olympic Festival held annually from 1796&ndash;1798, L'Olympiade de la République was held in France.<ref name=frencholympics>{{cite web |title=Histoire et évolution des Jeux olympiques|publisher=Potentiel|year=2005|url=http://www.lepotentiel.com/afficher_supplement.php?id_article=68524&id_supplement=8&id_edition=4405|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref> The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games marked an introduction of the metric system into sport.<ref name=frencholympics/>

An Olympian Class was begun at [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]], [[England]] in 1850, which was renamed Wenlock Olympian Games in 1859 and continues to this day as the [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games]]. A national Olympic Games in [[Great Britain]] was organized by, Dr [[William Penny Brookes]], at [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in [[London]], in 1866.<ref>{{cite web |title=Much Wenlock & the Olympian Connection|publisher=Wenlock Olympican Society|url=http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>

Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games, after the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]], was documented by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos (see [[Alexandros Soutsos|Alexandros Soutsos]]) in his poem "Dialogue of the Dead", published in 1833. Meanwhile [[Evangelos Zappas|Evangelis Zappas]], a wealthy Greek philanthropist, sponsored the modern revival of the ancient Olympic Games. The first modern international Olympic Games was held in an Athens city square in 1859 with participants from [[Greece]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Later Zappas paid for the refurbishment of the ancient [[Panathinaiko Stadium|Panathenian Stadium]]. Two Olympic Games were held in this stadium; one in 1870, followed by a second in 1875. <ref>Young (1996), 2, 13&ndash;23, 81</ref>

Many years after Zappas revived the Olympic Games in Greece. The French historian Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]], was searching for a reason for the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870&ndash;1871). He theorized that the French soldiers had not received proper physical education.<ref>Young (1996), 68</ref>  In 1890 he attended the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, and decided that a large-scale revival of the Olympic Games was achievable.  To date attempts to revive a modern version of the Olympic games had met with various amounts of success at the local (one or at most two participating nations) level.  

Coubertin built on the ideas of Brookes and the foundations of Zappas. His aim was to internationalize the Olympic Games (one of Brookes's ideas). He presented these ideas at the [[Olympic Congress]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] University in [[Paris]], [[France]], held from June 16 to June 23, 1894. On the last day of the congress, it was decided that the first multinational Olympic Games would take place in 1896 in Athens. To organize the Games, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) was established, with the Greek writer [[Demetrius Vikelas]] as its first president.<ref>Young (1996), 100&ndash;105</ref> The IOC's modern Olympic Movement was established, and a Games were to be held in the nation of their origin in 1896.

=== 1896 Games ===
{{main|1896 Olympic Games}}

There were less than 250&nbsp;athletes at the 1896 Summer Olympics|first Olympic Games. The [[Panathinaiko Stadium|Panathenian Stadium]] used for Zappas' Games of 1870 and 1875 was refurbished a second time in readiness for the 1896 Games.<ref>Darling (2004), 135</ref> This first modern Olympics had nine disciplines: [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Athletics]], [[Cycling at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Cycling]], [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Fencing]], [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Gymnastics]], [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Shooting]], [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Swimming]], [[Tennis at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Tennis]], [[Weightlifting at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Weightlifting]], and [[Wrestling at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Wrestling]]. The Greek officials and public were very enthusiastic about hosting the inaugural Games, and offered to host the Olympic Games permanently. The IOC decided differently, however, and the [[1900 Olympic Games|second Olympic Games]] took place in Paris, France. It was at the Paris Games that women were first allowed to compete.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paris 1900|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1900|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref>

=== Changes and Adaptations ===
{{main|Summer Olympic Games}}
[[Image:Olympic Golf 1900.jpg|thumb|right|The women's [[golf]] competition at the 1900 Paris Games.]]

After the initial success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics struggled. The celebrations in Paris (in 1900) and [[1904 Summer Olympics|St. Louis (in 1904)]] were overshadowed by the [[World's Fair]] exhibitions, which were held at the same times and locations. The St. Louis Games, for example, hosted 650&nbsp;athletes, but 580 of these athletes were from the [[United States at the 1904 Summer Olympics|United States]].  The homogenous nature of these Games was a low point for the Olympic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Louis 1904-Overview|publisher=ESPN|url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/fanguide/history?year=1904|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref>  The Games rebounded when the [[1906 Summer Olympics|1906 Intercalated Games]] (so&ndash;called because they were the second Games held within the third Olympiad) were held in Athens.  The Intercalated Games are not officially recognized as an Olympic Games, and no later Intercalated Games have been held.  These Games attracted a broad international field of participants, and generated great public interest.  This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Games.<ref>{{cite news|title=1906 Olympics mark 10th anniversary of the Olympic revival|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre|date=2008-05-28|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/05/f-olympics-feature-1906.html||accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref>

==== Winter Games ====
{{main|Winter Olympic Games}}

While figure skating had been an Olympic event at both the [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Games]] and the [[1920 Summer Olympics|Antwerp Games]], and ice hockey had also been held at the Antwerp Games, the IOC wanted equity between the winter and summer sports.  At the [[list of IOC meetings|1921 Congress]] in [[Lausanne]], the IOC decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic games.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chamonix 1924|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1924|accessdate=2008-09-05}}</ref>  The [[1924 Winter Olympics|first Winter Olympics]] were held in 1924 in [[Chamonix]], France. The IOC made the Winter Games a permanent fixture in the Olympic Movement in 1925 and mandated that they be celebrated every 4 years on the same year as their Summer counterpart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winter Olympics History|publisher=Utah Athletic Foundation|url=http://www.utah.com/olympics/history.htm|accessdate=2008-09-09}}</ref>  This tradition held until the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Games]] in [[Albertville]], France. Beginning with the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Games]] the Olympic games have alternated on different 4&ndash;year cycles. Hence the most recent Winter Games were held in 2006, while 2008 marked the latest celebration of the Summer Games.

==== Paralympics ====
{{main|Paralympics}}

In 1948 [[Ludwig Guttman|Sir Ludwig Guttman]], determined to innovate new ways to rehabilitate soldiers after World War II, organized a multi&ndash;sport event between various hospitals to coincide with the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]]. Guttman's event, known then as the [[World Wheelchair and Amputee Games|Stoke Mandeville Games]], became an annual sports festival. Over the next 12&nbsp;years Guttman and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing. For the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]] in [[Rome]], Guttman brought 400&nbsp;athletes to compete in the "Parallel Olympics"&ndash;the [[1960 Summer Paralympics|first Paralympics]]. The Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year since 1960.  The host city for the Olympics has also hosted the Paralympics since the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite news |title=History of the Paralympics|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7582206.stm|accessdate=2008-09-09}}</ref>

==== Youth Games ====
{{main|Youth Olympic Games}}

The Youth Olympic Games (YOG), were conceived by IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]] in 2001,<ref name="Rogge introduces">{{cite web |title=Rogge wants Youth Olympic Games |date=2007-03-19 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/6467087.stm |accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> and approved by the IOC at the 119th IOC session in [[Guatemala City]] in July 2007.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rice|first=John|title=IOC approves Youth Olympics; first set for 2010|work=The Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|date=2007-07-05|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-07-05-2774646336_x.htm|accessdate=2008-09-10}}<br/>* [http://www.fasterskier.com/racing4278.html FIS in favor of Youth Olympic Games] by [[FIS]], Dated [[2007-05-08]], Retrieved on [[2008-08-27]]</ref> The Youth Games will be shorter: the summer version will last at most twelve days; the winter version will last a maximum of nine days.<ref name="YOG pdf">{{cite web |title=Youth Olympic Games |year=2007|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://video.olympic.org/http://yog_uk.pdf  |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref><ref name=CRIonYOG>[http://english.cri.cn/2886/2007/04/25/1221@220491.htm IOC to Introduce Youth Olympic Games in 2010] dated [[2007-04-25]], Retrieved on [[2008-08-27]]</ref> The IOC will allow no more than 3,500&nbsp;athletes and 875&nbsp;officials to participate at the summer games, and 970&nbsp;athletes and 580&nbsp;official at the winter games.<ref name=YOGisGo>{{cite web|title=IOC session: A "go" for Youth Olympic Games|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|date=2007-07-05|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=2227|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref><ref name="No kidding">{{cite news |title=No kidding: Teens to get Youth Olympic Games |publisher=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-04-25-2774646336_x.htm  |accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>  The sports contested at these games will be the same as those scheduled for the traditional Games, but with a limited number of disciplines and events.

=== Modern Games ===
From the 241&nbsp;participants representing 14&nbsp;nations in 1896, the Games have grown to 10,500&nbsp;competitors from 204&nbsp;countries at the 2008 Summer Olympics in [[Beijing]].<ref name=iocfactsheet>{{cite web |title=IOC Factsheet|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|format=PDF|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1138.pdf|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>  The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is much smaller. For example, [[Turin]], [[Italy]] hosted 2,508&nbsp;athletes from 80&nbsp;countries competing in 84&nbsp;events during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Turin 2006|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=2006|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>  As participation in the Olympics has grown, so has its profile in the international media.  At the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Games]] in 2000, an estimated 3.7&nbsp;billion viewers [[broadcasting of sports events|watched the games]] on [[television]], and the official website of the Sydney Olympics generated over 11.3&nbsp;billion hits.<ref>{{cite web |title=100 Years of Olympic Marketing|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/facts/introduction/100years_uk.asp|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>   

The number of participating countries is noticeably higher than the 193 countries that currently belong to the [[United Nations]]. The International Olympic Committee allows nations to compete that do not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organizations demand. As a result, colonies and dependencies are permitted to host their own Olympic teams and athletes even if such competitors also hold citizenship in another member nation. Examples of this include territories such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Bermuda]], and [[Hong Kong]]; all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country. Since 1980, [[Taiwan]] has competed under the name [[Chinese Taipei]], and under a flag specially prepared by the IOC. Prior to that year the [[People's Republic of China]] refused to participate in the Games because Taiwan had been competing under the name [[Republic of China]].<ref name=corbit>{{cite web |title=China-Olympic History|publisher=Chinaorbit.com|url=http://www.chinaorbit.com/2008-olympics-china/olympic-games-history.html|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>

== Olympic Movement ==
The Olympic Movement is defined by the rules and guidelines of the [[Olympic Charter]].  It includes organizing committees for specific Games, International Federations for each sport featured at the Games, and the National Olympic Committees for each nation represented at the Games.  The umbrella organization of the Olympic Movement is the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), currently headed by [[Jacques Rogge]].<ref>{{cite web |title=International Olympic Committee|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/ioc/index_uk.asp|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> The IOC oversees the planning of the Olympic Games, and insures the host city is meeting its obligations. It makes all the important decisions, such as choosing the host city and the event program for each Games. The three major components of the Olympic Movement beyond the IOC are described in further detail as follows:  
* [[International Federation]]s (IFs), are the governing bodies of each sport (for example, [[FIFA]], the IF for [[football (soccer)]], and [[FIVB]], the international governing body for [[volleyball]]).  There are currently 35&nbsp;IFs in the Olympic Movement.<ref>{{cite web |title=For the Good of the Athletes|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|date=2007-10-31|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/ioc/n214186786.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>
* [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), which regulate the Olympic Movement within each country (e.g. [[USOC]], the NOC of the [[United States]]).  There are 205&nbsp;NOCs recognized by the IOC.<ref name=iocfactsheet/>
* Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs), which are the committees responsible for the organization of a specific celebration of the Olympics. OCOGs are dissolved after the celebration of each Games, once all subsequent paperwork has been completed.

=== Criticism ===
The IOC has often been criticized for being an intractable organization, with several members remaining on the Committee for life. The leadership of IOC presidents [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] and [[Avery Brundage]] were especially controversial. Brundage was president of the IOC for over 20&nbsp;years. During his tenure he protected the Olympics from untoward political involvement.<ref name=brundage>{{cite book |last=Maraniss|first=David|title=Rome 1960|year=2008|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=63-69|isbn=1-4165-3407-5 |unused_data=|location|New York}}</ref> He was also accused of both racism, for his handling of the [[apartheid]] issue with the [[South Africa]]n delegation, and [[anti-Semitism]].<ref name=brundage/> Under the Samaranch presidency, the Olympic Movement made great progress, but the President's office was accused of both [[nepotism]] and corruption.<ref>{{cite news |title=Samaranch Defends Nominating Son for IOC Post|publisher=CBC Sports|date=2001-05-18|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> Samaranch's ties with the [[Spain under Franco|Franco regime]] in [[Spain]], and his long term as IOC president (21&nbsp;years), have been points of criticism.<ref>{{cite news |last=Garber|first=Greg|title=Samaranch's Legacy:Controversy, Corruption|publisher=ESPN|date=2007-07-12|url=http://espn.go.com/oly/columns/garber_greg/1225329.html|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

In 1998, it became known that several IOC members had [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|taken bribes]] from the organizing committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], in exchange for voting for the city at the election of the host city. The IOC started an investigation, which led to four members resigning and six being expelled. The scandal set off further reforms; changing the way host cities are elected to avoid further bribes. Additional active and former athletes were added to the IOC and membership terms have been limited.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bribery Scandal Dulls Olympics' Century-old Shrine|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/olympic.probe/overview/|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

A [[BBC]] documentary, which aired in August 2004, entitled ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]: Buying the Games'', investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. The documentary claimed it is possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games,<ref>{{cite news

[[Paris]]ian Mayor [[Bertrand Delanoë]] specifically accused the [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and the London Bid Committee (headed by former Olympic gold medalist [[Sebastian Coe]]) of breaking the bid rules.

The [[Turin]] bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent member of the IOC, [[Marc Hodler]], himself strongly connected with rival [[Sion, Switzerland]]'s bid, alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee. These accusations led to a wide&ndash;ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members to Sion's bid and in fact may have helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.<ref>{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Berkes|title=How Turin got the Games|publisher=National Public Radio|date=2006-02-07|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195274|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

{{main|Olympic symbols}}

The Olympic movement uses symbols to represent ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The [[Olympic Rings]] are the most widely recognized symbol. These five intertwined rings represent the unity of the five inhabited continents (with the [[Americas]] regarded as one continent). The five colored rings on a white field form the [[Olympic Flag]]. The colors, white, red, blue, green, yellow, and black, were chosen because each nation has at least one of these colors in its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914, but the first flown at 1920 Summer Olympics in [[Antwerp]]. It is hoisted at each celebration of the Games.<ref name=olympicsymbols>{{cite web |title=The Olympic Symbols|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1303.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

The [[Olympic Motto]] is "''Citius, Altius, Fortius''," a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "Swifter, Higher, Stronger." Coubertin's ideals are illustrated by the [[Olympic Creed]]:

{{blockquote|"The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well."<ref name=olympicsymbols/>}}

Prior to each Games, the [[Olympic Flame]] is lit in Olympia, Greece and brought to the host city by runners carrying the torch in relay. There it plays an important role in the Opening Ceremonies. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the relay was introduced in [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]] as part of the German government's attempt to promote its [[National Socialist]] ideology.<ref name=olympicsymbols/>

The Olympic mascot, an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. It has played an important part of the Games since [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] with the debut of [[Misha]], a [[Russia]]n [[bear]]. The mascots of the most recent Olympic Games in Beijing were the [[Fuwa]]. They are five creatures that represent the five [[fengshui]] elements important in Chinese culture.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Official Mascots of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214068254.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

[[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] are the official languages of the Olympic movement.  The other official language used at each respective Olympic Games is the language of the host country. Consequently, every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the Opening Ceremonies) is spoken in French, English and the host country's native language.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Olympic Charter|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/charter_uk.asp|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

[[Image:BeijingOlimpicGames2008-08-08.jpg|thumb|left|A scene from the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in [[Beijing]].]]

As mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the Opening Ceremonies of a celebration of the Olympic Games.<ref name=OCFactSheetS>{{cite web | title=Fact sheet: Opening Ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games  |publisher=International Olympic Committee | month=February | year=2008|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1134.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2008-08-14 }}</ref><ref name=OCFactSheetW>{{cite web  | title=Fact sheet: Opening Ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games|publisher=International Olympic Committee  | month=February | year=2008 |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1036.pdf |format=PDF | accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref> Most of these rituals were established by the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, [[Belgium]].<ref name=OCprotocol1>{{cite web |title=The Modern Olympic Games |chapter=The development of the Games - Between festival and tradition |publisher=International Olympic Committee|pages=p. 5|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf |chapterurl=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf#pages=5  |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-29 }}</ref>  The ceremonies typically start with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of its culture.<ref name=OCprotocol1/> The artistic presentations have continued to grow in scale and complexity. The Opening Ceremony at the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100&nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic portion of the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre|date=2008-08-08|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html|accessdate=2008-09-09}}</ref>  

The traditional part of the ceremonies starts with a Parade of Nations, during which most participating athletes march into the stadium country by country. Each country's delegation is led by a sign with the name of their country followed by their nation's flag.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/>  The flag-bearer is selected from the nation's delegation.  Traditionally (starting at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]),Greece enters first due to its historical status as the progenitor of the Olympics while the host nation marches last.<ref name=OCprotocol1/> 

After all nations have entered, the president of the Organizing Committee makes a speech, followed by the IOC president who, at the end of his speech, introduces the representative of the host country who declares the Games open by reciting the formula: {{quote|''I declare open the Games of [name of the host city] celebrating the [ordinal number of the Olympiad] Olympiad of the modern era/[ordinal number of Winter Olympics] Olympic Winter Games''.<ref name="OCprotocol2">{{cite web |title=Olympic Charter|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|date=2007-07-07|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-29}}.</ref>}}  Presently the Olympic Charter requires the host nation's head of state to officially declare the opening of the Olympic Games, although there have been several instances throughout the modern Olympic history when someone other than the head of state has opened an Olympic Games.

The Olympic Flag is then carried horizontally (since the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]) into the stadium and hoisted as the [[Olympic Anthem]] is played. The Olympic Charter states that the Olympic Flag must "fly for the entire duration
of the Olympic Games from a flagpole placed in a prominent position in the main stadium".<ref name="OCprotocol2"/>  The flag bearers of all countries then circle a [[rostrum]], where one athlete (since the 1920 Summer Olympics) and one judge (since the 1972 Summer Olympics) speak the [[Olympic Oath]], declaring they will compete and judge according to the rules.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> Finally the [[Olympic Torch|torch]] is brought into the stadium and passed from athlete to athlete until it reaches the last carrier; often a well-known athlete from the host nation, who lights the fire in the stadium's cauldron.<ref name=OCprotocol2/>  Beginning at the post-[[World War I]] 1920 Summer Olympics, the lighting of the Olympic Flame was followed by the release of [[dove]]s, symbolizing peace.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> This gesture was discontinued after several doves were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics.<ref name=doves>{{cite web|title=When messengers of peace were burnt alive |publisher=Deccan Herald|date=2004-08-13 |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20040829084509/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/aug132004/oly5.asp  |accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref>

=== Closing ===
Various traditional elements frame the Closing Ceremonies of an Olympic Games, which take place after all athletic events have concluded. Flag bearers from each participating country enter the stadium in single file, behind them march all of the athletes without any distinction or grouping by nationality &ndash; a tradition that began during the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at the suggestion of Melbourne schoolboy [[John Ian Wing]], who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as one nation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Melbourne (Equestrian - Stockholm) 1956|publisher=[[British Olympic Association]] |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/gamesabout.aspx?gt=S&ga=14 |accessdate=2008-09-10}} </ref>

Three national flags are hoisted on flagpoles one at a time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece on the middle pole to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, the flag of the host country on the lefthand pole, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games on the righthand pole.<ref>{{cite web |title=Olympic Closing Ceremony Protocol|publisher=New Dehli Television|url=http://www.ndtv.com/olympics/storypage.aspx?storyid=SPOEN20080062750|date=2008-08-30|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> 

The president of the Organizing Committee makes a speech, followed by the IOC president, who formally closes the Olympics by saying: <blockquote>''I declare the Games of the [ordinal number] Olympiad/[ordinal number] Olympic Winter/Summer Games closed and, in accordance with tradition, I call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in [name of host city] to celebrate the Games of the [subsequent ordinal number] Olympiad/[subsequent ordinal number] Olympic Winter/Summer Games''.</blockquote> The Olympic Flame is extinguished and, while the Olympic Anthem is played, the Olympic Flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremonies is lowered from the flagpole and carried from the stadium.<ref>{{cite web |title=Closing Ceremony|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|date=2002-01-31|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_268.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>

In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony (because the tradition began at the Antwerp Games), the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic Flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> The receiving mayor then waves the flag eight times. 
After these traditional elements, the next host nation introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of that country. This tradition began with the 1976 Games. During the closing ceremony of the Beijing Games the presentation by [[London]], host of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], featured guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], recording artist [[Leona Lewis]], and footballer [[David Beckham]].<ref>{{cite news |title=London Takes Over as Olympic Host|date=2008-08-24|publisher=The BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7577999.stm|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

=== Medal presentation ===

After each Olympic event is completed a medal ceremony is held. A three-tiered rostrum is used for the medal winners, with the gold medal winner ascending to the highest platform. The medals are awarded by a member of the IOC.<ref>{{cite web |title=Olympic Games - the Medal Ceremonies|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-249556/Olympic-Games|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref> After medals are awarded, the flags of the nations of the three medalists are raised. The flag of the gold medalist's country is in the center and raised the highest while the flag of the silver medalist's country is on the left facing the flags and the flag of the bronze medalist's country is on the right.  The flags are raised while the [[national anthem]] of the gold medalist's country plays.<ref name=otraditions>{{cite web |title=Symbols and Traditions|publisher=USA Today|date=1999-07-12|url=http://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr03.htm|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref> Citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies. They aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag bearers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Medal Ceremony Hostess Outfits Revealed|publisher=China Daily|date=2008-07-18|url=http://english.sina.com/china/p/1/2008/0718/172118.html|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>  All three medal winners receive a bouquet of flowers along with their medals during the ceremony. The medal ceremony is usually held directly after the event is completed. A notable exception is the men's marathon, which is usually held early in the morning on the last day of Olympic competition and the medal ceremony is then traditionally held in the evening at the closing ceremonies.

== Sports ==
{{main|Olympic sports}}

Currently, the Olympic program consists of 35&nbsp;sports, 53&nbsp;disciplines and more than 400&nbsp;events. The Summer Olympic program includes 28&nbsp;sports with 38&nbsp;disciplines, and the Winter Olympic program is comprised of 7&nbsp;sports with 15&nbsp;disciplines.<ref name="Sports">{{cite web |url=http://olympic.org/uk/sports/index_uk.asp |title=Sports |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> There were 9&nbsp;sports on the original Olympic program in 1896: [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[cycling]], [[fencing]], [[gymnastics]], [[weightlifting]], [[shooting]], [[swimming]], [[tennis]], and [[sport wrestling|wrestling]]; the [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] events were cancelled due to bad weather.<ref name="C98-99">Coubertin&ndash;Philemon&ndash;Politis&ndash;Anninos (1897), 98&ndash;99, 108&ndash;109</ref>

Of the 15 disciplines in 7 sports featured at the most recent Winter Olympics, [[cross country skiing]], [[figure skating]], [[ice hockey]], [[Nordic combined]], [[ski jumping]], and [[long track speed skating|speed skating]] have been on the program at all Winter Olympics. In addition, figure skating made its debut at the [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Summer Olympics of 1908]] and ice hockey was first contested at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp before the introduction of a separate Winter Games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Olympic History|publisher=ABC Australia|date=2002-01-24|url=http://www.abc.net.au/winterolympics/2002/features/history.htm|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>  

Rule 48.1 of the Olympic Charter requires that there be a minimum of 15 Olympic sports at each Summer Games. At its 114th Session, in 2002, the IOC limited the Summer Games to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes. The Olympic sports are defined as those governed by the International Federations listed in Rule 46 of the Olympic Charter. A two-thirds vote of the IOC is required to amend the Charter to promote a Recognized Federation to Olympic status and make the sports it governs eligible for inclusion on the Olympic program. Rule 47 of the Charter requires that only Olympic sports may be included on the program.<ref name=ocharter>{{cite web |title=Olympic Charter|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|date=2007-07-07|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

The IOC reviews the Olympic program at its first session following each Olympiad. A simple majority is required for an Olympic sport to be included in the Olympic program. Under the current rules, an Olympic sport not selected for inclusion in a particular Games remains an Olympic sport and may be included at a subsequent Olympic games. At the [[117th IOC Session]], 26 sports were approved for the program for London 2012.<ref name=ocharter/>

=== Amateurism and professionalism ===
{{see|Amateurism}}

The ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|English public schools]] greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin.<ref name=OIdeology>{{cite book |last=Eassom|first=Simon|title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology|year=1994|location=Ontario|publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies|page=120&ndash;123|isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}</ref>  The public schools subscribed to the [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying ''[[mens sana in corpore sano]]''&mdash;a sound mind in a healthy body. In this ethos, a [[gentleman]] was one who became an all&ndash;rounder, not the best at one specific thing.  There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practicing or training was considered tantamount to cheating.<ref name=OIdeology/> Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby. <ref name=OIdeology/>

The exclusion of professionals has caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. 1912 Olympic [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he played semi-professional [[baseball]] prior to winning his medals. He was restored as champion on compassionate grounds by the IOC in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography|publisher=Biography.com|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref> Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were considered professionals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1936|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.<ref name=OIdeology/> The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur; as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism.<ref> {{cite paper |last=Schantz|first=Otto|title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses – from Coubertin to Samaranch|publisher=Comité International Pierre De Coubertin|form=PDFlink|url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> Beginning in the 1970s, amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter. Eventually the decisions on professional participation were left to the [[sport governing body|international federation]] for each sport. As of 2004, the only sports in which no professionals compete is [[boxing]] (though even this requires a definition of amateurism based on fight rules rather than on payment, as some boxers receive cash prizes from their National Olympic Committees); in men's [[football (soccer)]], the number of players over 23&nbsp;years of age is limited to 3 per team.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amateurism|date=1999-07-12|publisher=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr01.htm|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

{{main|Olympic boycotts}}

The [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]] were the first Olympics to be [[boycott]]ed. [[The Netherlands]], [[Spain at the 1956 Summer Olympics|Spain]], and [[Switzerland at the 1956 Summer Olympics|Switzerland]] refused to attend because of the repression of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungarian Uprising]] by the [[Soviet Union]]; additionally, [[Cambodia at the 1956 Summer Olympics|Cambodia]], [[Egypt at the 1956 Summer Olympics|Egypt]], [[Iraq]] and [[Lebanon]] boycotted the games due to the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name="Boycott 1">{{cite web |title= Melbourne/Stockholm 1956: Did you know?|publisher= The International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/innovations_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1956 |accessdate=2008-08-27 }}</ref>  In [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban [[South Africa]], [[Rhodesia]], and [[New Zealand]]. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand in 1976 because the boycott was prompted by a New Zealand [[rugby union]] tour to South Africa, and rugby was not an Olympic sport. The countries withdrew their teams after the games had started and a few African athletes had already competed. Twenty-two countries (Guyana was the only non-African nation) boycotted the [[Montreal]] Olympics because New Zealand was not banned.<ref name="Boycott 2">{{cite web |title= Montreal 1976: Did you know?|publisher= International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/innovations_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1976 |accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>

Also at the Montreal Games of 1976, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) exerted pressure on the IOC to keep the team from the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) from competing under the name "Republic of China".  The Republic of China refused to agree to a proposed compromise that would have allowed Taiwan to use the [[flag of the Republic of China|ROC flag]] and [[National Anthem of the Republic of China|anthem]]. Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when it returned under the name of [[Chinese Taipei]] and used a special flag.<ref name=corbit/>

In 1980 and 1984, the [[Cold War]] opponents boycotted each other's games. Sixty-five nations refused to compete at the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics in 1980]] because of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. The boycott reduced the number of nations participating to only 81, the lowest number of nations to compete since 1956. The [[Soviet Union]] and 14 of its [[Eastern Bloc]] partners (except [[Romania]]) countered by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics in 1984]]. They contended that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes. Soviet officials were quoted as saying, "chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria are being whipped up in the United States."<ref>{{cite news |last=Burns|first=John F.|title=Protests are Issue: Russians Charge ‘Gross Flouting’ of the Ideals of the Competition|publisher=New York Times|date=1984-05-09}}</ref> The nations that boycotted the 1984 Games staged their own [[Friendship Games]] in July and August.<ref name="1980 Boycott">{{cite web|title=1980 Moscow Olympic Games|publisher= Moscow-Life |url=http://www.moscow-life.com/moscow/olympic-games |accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref><ref name="1980 Boycott 2"> {{cite web |title= Los Angeles 1984: Did you know?|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/innovations_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1984 |accessdate=2008-08-28 }}</ref>

There had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]] and response to the recent disturbances in [[Tibet]], [[Darfur]], and Taiwan. U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] showcased these concerns in a highly publicized speech in Thailand just prior to the opening of the Games.

=== Politics ===
[[Image:Carlos-Smith.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tommie Smith]] (center) and [[John Carlos]] (right) showing the [[raised fist]] in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]].]]
{{main|Politics in the Olympics}}

The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]] were used by the German [[Nazi Party]] to promote the superiority of both the [[aryan|Aryan race]] and the [[facist]] political structure. [[Luz Long]], a German competitor in the long jump, helped [[Jesse Owens]] (a [[Black people|black]] athlete) to win the long jump at the expense of his own chance to win the event. For his efforts he was posthumously awarded the [[Pierre de Coubertin Medal]].<ref name="Nazi Olympics">{{cite web |title= The Nazi Olympics|publisher= The American-Israeli Cooperative  Enterprise |year=2006 |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/olympics.html |accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> In a similar vein, the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] did not participate in the Olympic Games until the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]]. Instead, in 1928 the Soviets organized an international sports event called [[Spartakiad]]s. Many athletes from [[Communist]] countries or from countries with close political ties to the Soviet Union chose not to participate, or were even barred from participating, in the Olympic Games and instead participated in Spartakiads.<ref name=GSE>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Spartakiads|encyclopedia=Great Soviet Encyclopedia|volume=24 (part 1)|page 286|year=1976|publisher=Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya|location=Moscow}}</ref>

A political incident on a smaller scale occurred at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]]. Two American track and field athletes, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], who finished first and third in the 200 meter [[track and field]] race, performed the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] on the victory stand. The second place finisher [[Peter Norman]] wore an [[Olympic Project for Human Rights]] badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC President [[Avery Brundage]] told the [[United States Olympic Committee]] to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the complete track and field team. The USOC opted for the former.<ref name="Black Salute">{{cite news |title=1968: Black athletes make silent protest |publisher= BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> The photo of the three men on the medal podium has become an iconic Olympic image.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iconic Image of Protest Still Resonates |publisher=The Irish Times|date=2008-08-04|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2008/0804/1217628486446.html|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>  

Interference of politics in the Games is not a thing of the past. Currently, the government of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] specifically orders its athletes not to compete in any Olympic heat, semi-final, or final that includes athletes from [[Israel]]. This directive had an impact at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] when an Iranian [[judoka]], who had otherwise earned his place, did not compete in a match against an Israeli judoka.<ref name="Iran-Israel">{{cite news |title=Games hit by crisis over Iran-Israel contest |date=2004-08-16|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200408/s1177025.htm  |accessdate=2008-08-28}} </ref>

=== Doping ===
In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve their athletic abilities. For example, the winner of the [[marathon (sports)|marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]], [[Thomas J. Hicks]], was given [[strychnine]] and [[brandy]] by his coach, even during the race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> As these methods became more extreme, it became increasingly evident that [[doping in sport|doping]] was not only a threat to the integrity of sport but could also have potentially fatal side effects on the athlete. The only Olympic death linked to doping occurred at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome Games of 1960]]. During the cycling road race, [[Denmark at the 1960 Summer Olympics|Danish]] cyclist [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Anti-Doping|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/dynamic.ch2?pageCategory.id=312|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> By the mid&ndash;1960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance enhancing drugs, and the IOC followed suit in 1967.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sharon|last=Begley|title=The Drug Charade|publisher=Newsweek|date=2008-01-07|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>

The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance enhancing drugs was [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]], a Swedish [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall|publisher=123explore.com |url=http://www.123exp-biographies.com/t/00034345906/|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> The most publicized doping-related disqualification was that of [[Canada|Canadian]] sprinter [[Ben Johnson (athlete)|Ben Johnson]], who won the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics|100 meter dash]] at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Seoul Olympics]], but tested positive for [[stanozolol]]. His gold medal was subsequently stripped and awarded to runner-up [[Carl Lewis]], who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics, but had not been banned.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|date=2003-04-18|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>  
 
Despite the testing, many athletes continued to use medication to improve their athletic ability without getting caught. In 1990, documents were revealed that showed many [[East Germany|East German]] female athletes had been administered [[anabolic steroid]]s and other drugs by their coaches and trainers. Girls as young as eleven were started on the drug regimen without consent from their parents. American female swimmers, including [[Shirley Babashoff]], accused the East Germans of using performance enhancing drugs as early as the 1976 Games.<ref>{{cite news |first=Christine|last=Brennan |title=Babashoff had Mettle to Speak out about Steroids|date=2004-07-14|publisher=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/brennan/2004-07-15-brennan_x.htm|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>  No clear evidence of doping was discovered until after the fall of the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|Berlin Wall]], when the aforementioned documents proved that East Germany had embarked on a state-sponsored program to dramatically improve their competitiveness at the Olympic Games and other international sporting events. Many of the culprits have been subsequently tried and found guilty of various crimes in the German penal system.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jere|last=Longman|title=Just Following Orders, Doctors' Orders|publisher=The New York Times|date=2001-04-22|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E3D71330F931A15757C0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref><ref name=DeutscheWelle> {{cite web |title=Sports Doping Statistics Reach Plateau in Germany|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=2006-02-26|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,786574,00.html|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, the IOC took the initiative in a more organized battle against doping, leading to the formation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in 1999. The 2000 Summer Olympics and [[2002 Winter Olympics]] have shown that this battle is not nearly over, as several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified due to doping offenses. During the 2006 Winter Olympics, only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the "Olympic Standard") has set the world-wide benchmark that other sporting federations around the world attempt to emulate.<ref>{{cite web |first=Zachary|last=Coile|title=Bill Seeks to Toughen Drug Testing in Pro Sports|date=2005-04-27|publisher=San Francisco Chornicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/27/MNGMICG0SS1.DTL|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood testing was used in a coordinated effort to detect not only banned substances but also [[blood doping]]. While several athletes were barred from competition by their National Olympic Committees prior to the Games, three athletes failed drug tests while in competition in Beijing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doping: 3667 athletes tested, IOC seeks action against Halkia's coach|date=2008-08-19|publisher=Express India Newspapers|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Doping-3667-athletes-tested-IOC-seeks-action-against-Halkias-coach/350677/|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref><ref name=WADAHistory> {{cite web|title=A Brief History of Anti-Doping|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency |url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/dynamic.ch2?pageCategory.id=312|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

=== Violence ===
Despite what Coubertin had hoped for, the Olympics did not bring total peace to the world. In fact, three [[Olympiad]]s had to pass without a celebration of the Games because of war: the [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916 Games]] were cancelled due to [[World War I]], and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of [[World War II]]. The [[2008 South Ossetia war|South Ossetia War]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]] erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[Vladimir Putin|Prime Minister Putin]] were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bush Meets Putin over Georgia Fighting|publisher=CNN|date=2008-08-08|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/08/georgia.reax/index.html|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> When [[Nino Salukvadze]] of Georgia won the bronze medal in the [[Shooting at the 2008 Summer Olympics|10-meter air pistol]] competition, she stood on the medal podium with [[Natalia Paderina]], a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicized event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.<ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic Shooters Hug as their Countries do Battle|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/olympic.embrace/|accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref>

Terrorism has also threatened the Olympic Games. In 1972, when the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] were held in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], eleven members of the [[Israel at the Olympics|Israel]]i Olympic team were taken hostage by the [[terrorist]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]] in what is now known as the [[Munich massacre]]. A bungled liberation attempt led to the deaths of the nine abducted athletes who had not been killed prior to the rescue. Also killed were five of the terrorists and a German policeman.<ref>{{cite web |title=Olympic archive|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-41-1289-7332/sports/olympics_cbc/clip5|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref> Another example of terrorism at the Olympics came during the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in 1996]] in [[Atlanta]]. A [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb]] was detonated at the [[Centennial Olympic Park]], which killed 2 and injured 111 others. The bomb was set by [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], an American [[domestic terrorist]], who is currently serving a life sentence at [[ADX Florence]] in [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Colorado]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Olympic Park Bombing|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

{{see also|List of multiple Olympic gold medalists}}

The athletes or teams who place first, second, or third in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals &ndash; solid [[gold]] until 1912, after which they were made of [[Gilding|gilded]] silver and now [[Gold plating|gold plated]] silver. Every gold medal must contain at least 6 grams of pure gold.<ref name="BeijingOlymp-1">{{cite web |title=Medals of Beijing Olympic Games Unveiled|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/67/83/article214028367.shtml|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> The runners-up receive [[silver]] medals and the third-place athletes are awarded [[bronze]] medals. In events contested by a [[single-elimination tournament]] (most notably [[boxing]]), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. The practice of awarding medals to the top three competitors was introduced in 1906; at the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] only the first two received a medal, silver and bronze. Various prizes, including for works of art, were awarded in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]]. The [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]] also awarded silver trophies for first place.  The three medal format was first used at the Intercalated Games of 1906.  Since the IOC no longer recognizes these games as official Olympic games, the first official awarding of the three medals came in the London Olympics of 1908. From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as "victory diplomas".  In 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given [[wreath]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Modern Olympic Games|publisher=The Olympic Museum|form=PDF|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref> The IOC does not keep track of overall medal tallies per country, but the media often publish unofficial medal counts.  National Olympic Committees also keep track of medal statistics as a measure of success.<ref>{{cite web|last=Munro|first=James|title=Britain may aim for third in 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2008-08-25|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7579901.stm|accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref>

The question of which athlete is the most successful of all time is a difficult one to answer. The diversity of the sports and the evolution of the Olympic Games since 1896 complicate the matter. While it may not be the most equitable way to measure success, a list of the most titles won at the Modern Olympic Games by individuals is one way to determine the greatest Olympic athletes of all time.

== Host Cities ==
{{main|List of Olympic host cities}}

By 2012, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 42&nbsp;cities in 22&nbsp;countries, but only by cities outside of [[Europe]] and [[North America]] on 7&nbsp;occasions.  Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania 4 times, which is a sharp increase compared to the previous 92 years of modern Olympic history. All bids by countries in [[South America]] and [[Africa]] have failed.  The number in parentheses following the city or country denotes how many times that city or country had then hosted the games. The table includes the [[1906 Summer Olympics|Intercalated Games of 1906]], which the IOC no longer considers official Olympic Games.
