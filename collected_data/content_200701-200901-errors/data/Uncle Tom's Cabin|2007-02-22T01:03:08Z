'''''Uncle Tom's Cabin, or, Life Among the Lowly''''' is a [[novel]] by [[United States|American]] author [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] which treats [[slavery]] as a central theme.  The novel had a profound effect on the world's view of [[African-Americans]] and slavery, so much so in the latter case that people have said the book laid the groundwork for the [[American Civil War]].<ref>''The Civil War in American Culture'' by Will Kaufman, Edinburgh University Press, 2006, page 18.</ref>

Stowe, a [[Connecticut]]-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active [[abolitionist]], first published this book on [[March 20]], [[1852]].  The story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave around whose life the other characters&mdash;both fellow slaves and slave owners&mdash;revolve. The novel depicts the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that [[Christianity|Christian]] love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings.

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was the best-selling novel of the 19th century (and the second best-selling book of the century after the Bible)<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-uncletomscabin/intro.html Introduction to Uncle Tom's Cabin Study Guide], accessed May 16, 2006.</ref> and is credited with helping to fuel the [[abolitionist]] cause in the 1850s. In the first year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold in the United States alone. The book's impact was so great that when [[Abraham Lincoln]] met Stowe at the start of the [[American Civil War]], Lincoln is often quoted as having declared, "So this is the little lady who made this big war."<ref>Charles Edward Stowe, ''Harriet Beecher Stowe: The Story of Her Life'' (1911) p. 203.</ref>

The book also created and spread several common stereotypes about [[blacks]], many of which endure to this day. These include the affectionate, dark-skinned [[mammy archetype|mammy]]; the [[Pickaninny]] stereotype of black children; and the [[Uncle Tom]], or dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress. In recent years, the negative associations with ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' have to a large degree overshadowed the historical impact of the book. 

==Origins==
Stowe wrote the novel as a response to the 1850 passage of the second [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], which punished those who aided runaway blacks and diminished the rights of fugitives as well as freed blacks.  Much of the book was composed in [[Brunswick%2C_Maine|Brunswick]], [[Maine]], while Calvin Stowe taught at his alma mater, [[Bowdoin College]].<ref>[http://www.harrietbeecherstowecenter.org/life/#uncle Harriet Beecher Stowe House]. Accessed Feb. 17, 2007.</ref>

Some historians believe that Stowe was inspired by the autobiography of [[Josiah Henson]], an African-American who lived and worked on a 3,700 acre tobacco plantation in [[Maryland]] owned by Isaac Riley.<ref>[http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/2006-01-13-voa58.cfm?CFID=18191928&CFTOKEN=51628745 "Historic Uncle Tom's Cabin Saved"] by Susan Logue, VOA News, January 12, 2006. Accessed May 16, 2006.</ref> Henson was one of the first escaped slaves in the United States to write a memoir and Harriet Beecher Stowe evidently acknowledged that Henson's writings inspired ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. When Stowe's book became famous, Henson republished his memoirs as ''The Memoirs of Uncle Tom'' and traveled extensively in America and Europe.<ref>[http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/2006-01-13-voa58.cfm?CFID=18191928&CFTOKEN=51628745 "Historic Uncle Tom's Cabin Saved"] by Susan Logue, VOA News, January 12, 2006. Accessed May 16, 2006.</ref>

''American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses'', a volume co-authored by [[Theodore Dwight Weld]] and the [[Grimk√© sisters]], is also identified as a source of some of the material.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/we/Weld-The.html The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001-05]</ref>

Prior to the Civil War, Harriet Beecher Stowe and her husband; with the help of some neighbors, made their home in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state. In Cincinnati the [[Underground Railroad]] had local abolitionist sympathizers and was active in efforts to help runaway slaves on their escape route from the South. Stowe amassed a large quantity of research from oral and written sources, which she incorporated as story material for the novel. She only made brief visits to Kentucky towns and was never on a slave farm.

== Publication ==

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was first published as a 40-week serial, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly'' published in the ''[[National Era]]'', an [[abolitionist]] periodical, starting in the [[5 June]] [[1851]] issue.  It was published in book form on [[March 20]], [[1852]].

In the first year after the book was published, 300,000 copies of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' were sold. The book eventually became the bestselling novel in the world during the 19th century (and the second best-selling book after the Bible), with the book being translated into every major language.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-uncletomscabin/intro.html Introduction to Uncle Tom's Cabin Study Guide], accessed May 16, 2006.</ref> A number of the early editions carried an introduction by [[James Sherman (minister)|Rev James Sherman]], a Congregational minister in [[London]] noted for his abolitionist views.

Because the [[copyright]] laws of the time did not place any limits on stage dramatizations of fictional works, stage dramatizations, soon known as "Tom shows", began to appear during the period while Stowe's original work was still being published serially.

== Reaction to the novel ==

The novel outraged people in the [[American South]].<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2958.html Slave narratives and Uncle Tom's Cabin], Africans in America, PBS, accessed Feb. 16, 2007.</ref> Acclaimed Southern novelist [[William Gilmore Simms]] declaring the work utterly false,<ref>"Simms's Review of Uncle Tom's Cabin" by Charles S.

Ridgely, American Literature, Vol. 31, No. 4 (Jan., 1960), pp. 421-433.</ref>

According to Stowe's son, when Lincoln met her in 1862 he commented, "So this is the little lady who started this great war."<ref>Charles Edward Stowe, ''Harriet Beecher Stowe: The Story of Her Life'' (1911) p. 203.</ref> Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made.<ref>''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', introduction by Amanda Claybaugh, Barnes and Noble Classics, New York, 2003, page xvii.</ref> Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of blacks and the [[Fugitive Slave Law]].<ref>''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', introduction by Amanda Claybaugh, Barnes and Noble Classics, New York, 2003, page xvii.</ref> [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[General]] and [[politician]] [[James Baird Weaver]] said that the book convinced him to become active in the [[abolitionist]] movement.<ref>"Review of James Baird Weaver by Fred Emory Haynes" by A. M.

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' also created great interest in England. The first London edition appeared in May, 1852, and sold 200,000 copies.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2958.html Slave narratives and Uncle Tom's Cabin], Africans in America, PBS, accessed Feb. 16, 2007.</ref>  Much of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, "The evil passions which 'Uncle Tom' gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance [of slavery], but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America--we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system--our Tories hate her democrats--our [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] hate her [[parvenu]]s--our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." <ref>Nassau Senior, quoted in Ephraim Douglass Adams, ''Great Britain and the American Civil War'' (1958) p: 33. </ref>  [[Charles Francis Adams]], the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that, "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed."<ref> Charles Francis Adams, ''Trans-Atlantic Historical Solidarity: Lectures Delivered before the University of Oxford in Easter and Trinity Terms, 1913.'' 1913. p. 79</ref>

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' is credited with aiding anti-segregation efforts around the world. For example, [[Alamayahu Tana]] translated the novel into [[Amharic language|Amharic]] around 1930, in support of [[Ethiopia]]n efforts to end the suffering of all blacks in that nation.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University Press, 1968), p. 122.</ref>

This book was also the first American novel translated into Chinese, by translator [[Lin Shu]].

==Plot summary==
[[Image:legree.png|Simon Legree and Uncle Tom|right|frame|Simon Legree assaulting Uncle Tom.]]
{{spoiler}}

===Tom owned by George Shelby===

The book opens with a [[Kentucky]] farmer named [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Arthur Shelby|Arthur Shelby]] who is about to lose his farm because of massive debts. Even though he and his wife ([[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Emily Shelby|Emily Shelby]]) believed that they had a benevolent relationship with their slaves, Shelby decided to raise the needed funds by selling two of them &mdash; [[Uncle Tom]], a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby‚Äôs maid [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Eliza|Eliza]] &mdash; to a slave trader. Emily Shelby hated the idea of doing this because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#George Shelby|George Shelby]], hated to see Tom go because he considered that loveable old man to be his good friend.

===Eliza and Harry escape===

When Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby discussing the fact that Mr. Shelby has sold Tom and Harry to the slavetrader Haley, Eliza determines to run away in order to save her son.  She is pushed to this decision not by any physical cruelty on the part of her master or mistress, but by the maternal fear of losing her only surviving child (she has already lost two children by miscarriage).  She departs in the night, leaving a note of apology to her mistress.

===Tom is ‚ÄúSold down the river‚Äù===

While all of this is happening, Uncle Tom is sold and taken down the Mississippi River. On the boat, Tom meets and befriends a young white girl named [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Eva|Eva]]. When Eva falls into the river, Tom saves her. In gratitude, Eva's father, [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Augustine St. Clare|Augustine St. Clare]], buys Tom from Haley and takes him with the family to their home in [[New Orleans]]. Tom and Eva come to relate to one another in a very special way, sharing a deep Christian faith between them.

===George, Eliza and Harry escape===

As Eliza and her husband George Harris, who ran away previously, attempt to reach Canada, they are cornered by Loker and his men, causing George to shoot Loker. Worried that Loker may die, Eliza convinces George and the Quakers to bring the slave hunter to a nearby Quaker settlement for medical treatment.

===Tom owned by Augustine St. Clare===

Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery with his cousin Ophelia who, while opposing slavery, is deeply prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, is not biased against blacks. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Topsy|Topsy]], a young black slave. St. Clare then asks Ophelia to educate Topsy.

After Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she experiences a vision of heaven, which she shares with the people around her. As a result of her death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to love her slaves more, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Uncle Tom.

===Tom sold to Simon Legree===

Before St. Clare can follow through on his pledge, he is fatally stabbed while intervening in a fight. His wife reneges on her late husband's vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious [[plantation]] owner named [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Simon Legree|Simon Legree]]. Legree (who is not a native southerner but a transplanted [[Yankee]]) takes Tom to rural [[Louisiana]] where Tom meets Legree's other slaves, including Emmeline (whom Legree purchased at the same time). Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Tom receives a brutal beating, and Legree resolves to crush Tom's faith in [[God]].  But Tom refuses to stop [[reading (activity)|reading]] his [[Bible]] and trying to comfort the other slaves as best he can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree's slaves. Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold to different owners; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold and possibly mistreated, she killed her third child.

At this point Tom Loker returns to the story. Loker has changed as the result of being healed by and living with the Quakers. In addition, George, Eliza, and Harry obtained their freedom after they crossed over into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is stretched to the limit because of the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions &mdash; one of [[Jesus]] and one of Eva &mdash; which renews his resolve to remain faithful with [[Christ]], even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, the cruel master orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men make commitments to become Christians. George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives with money in hand to buy Tom‚Äôs freedom, but is too late.

===Final Section===

On their boat ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris‚Äô sister and accompany her to Canada. Once there Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was sold as a child. Now that their family is together again, they travel to [[France]] and eventually [[Liberia]], the African nation created for former American slaves. There Cassy's long-lost son will also meet them. George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm and frees all his slaves. George tells them to remember Tom‚Äôs sacrifice and his belief in the true meaning of Christianity.

==Major characters==
===Uncle Tom===

Uncle Tom, the title character, was initially seen as a noble long-suffering Christian slave. In more recent years his name has become an epithet directed towards certain [[African-Americans]] because he was derided as being a submissive slave who is punished despite his loyalty. Uncle Tom has come to represent African-Americans who are accused of selling out to whites, thereby allegedly becoming a bad role model for black society.  Ironically, Stowe clearly intended to portray Uncle Tom as a praiseworthy person. Throughout the book, far from allowing himself to be exploited, he stands up for his beliefs and is grudgingly admired even by his enemies.

===Eliza===
A slave (personal maid to Mrs. Shelby), she escapes to the North with her five-year old son Harry after he is sold to Mr. Haley. Her husband, George, eventually finds Eliza and Harry in [[Ohio]], and emigrates with them to [[Canada]], then [[France]] and finally [[Liberia]].

The character Eliza was inspired by an account given at [[Lane Theological Seminary]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] by [[John Rankin (abolitionist)|John Rankin]] to Stowe's husband Calvin, a professor at the school. According to Rankin, in February, 1838 a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen [[Ohio River]] to the town of [[Ripley, Ohio|Ripley]] with her child in her arms and stayed at his house on her way further north. (Hagedorn, pp. 135-39)

===Eva===
Eva, whose real name is Evangeline St. Clare, is the daughter of Augustine St. Clare. Eva enters the narrative when [[Uncle Tom]] is traveling via [[steamship]] to [[New Orleans]] to be sold, and he rescues the 5 or 6 year-old girl from drowning. Eva begs her father to buy Tom, and he becomes the head coachman at the St. Clare [[plantation]]. He spends most of his time with the angelic Eva, however.

Eva constantly talks about love and forgiveness, even convincing the dour slave girl Topsy that she deserves love.  She even manages to touch the heart of her sour aunt, Ophelia. Some consider Eva to be a prototype of the character archetype known as the [[Mary Sue]].

Eventually Eva falls ill. Before dying, she gives a lock of her hair to each of the slaves, telling them that they must become [[Christianity|Christians]] so that they may see each other in [[Heaven]]. On her deathbed, she convinces her father to free Tom, but because of circumstances the promise never materializes.

===Simon Legree===
A [[villain]]ous and cruel slave owner‚Äîa Northerner by birth‚Äîwhose name has become synonymous with greed.  It is Tom's Christianity which arouses him.

===Topsy===
A "ragamuffin" young slave girl of unknown origin (she claims to have "just growed").  She was transformed by Little Eva's love. Topsy is often seen as the origin of the [[pickaninny]] stereotype of Black children.

The phrase "growed like Topsy" (later "grew like Topsy"; now somewhat archaic) passed into the English language, originally with the specific meaning of unplanned growth, later sometimes just meaning enormous growth.<ref>[http://www.word-detective.com/052003.html The Word Detective], issue of May 20, 2003, accessed Feb. 16, 2007.</ref>

==Other characters==
===Arthur Shelby===
Tom's master in Kentucky. Shelby is characterized as a "kind" slaveowner and a stereotypical Southern gentleman. When Shelby experiences a financial crisis because of [[gambling]] debts, he sells Tom and Harry to save his plantation.

===Emily Shelby===
Mr. Shelby's wife is a deeply religious woman who strives to be a kind and moral influence upon her slaves. She is appalled when her husband negotiates to sell his slaves with a slave trader, especially since she promised Harry's mother, Eliza, that this would not happen. As a woman, she had no legal way to stop this, as all property belonged to her husband.

===George Shelby===
Arthur and Emily's son. At the beginning of the novel he is thirteen years old and teaches Tom to read. He vows to find Tom when he is sold. He eventually does this, but not until years later when Tom is near death. Inspired by Tom, young Shelby frees the slaves on his deceased father's plantation.

===Augustine St. Clair===
Tom's second owner, father of Little Eva; of the slaveowners in the novel, the most sympathetic character. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery, but is not quite ready to relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more religious and starts to read the bible to Tom. The words sink deep into his heart and made him feel that he is close to what his young daughter used to believe. His sometimes good intentions ultimately come to nothing: upon his death, Tom and his other slaves (excepting only Topsy) are put on the auction block.

==Criticism and Stereotypes==
When ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' first appeared, it was roundly criticized by Southern slave owners and others who supported slavery (see the [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Anti-Tom literature|Anti-Tom literature]] section below for more information). In more recent years, readers have criticized the book for what is seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, especially with regard to the character's appearance, speech, and behavior and the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate.

The novel's creation and use of common [[stereotypes]] about [[African Americans]] is important because ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-uncletomscabin/intro.html Introduction to Uncle Tom's Cabin Study Guide].</ref> As a result, the book had a major role in permanently engraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.

Among the negative stereotypes in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' are:  	 

* The "happy darky" (in the lazy, carefree character of Sam); 	 
* The light-skinned tragic [[mulatto]] as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); 	 
* The affectionate, dark-skinned female [[mammy]] (in the character of Mammy, who is a cook at the St. Clare plantation). 	 
* The [[Pickaninny]] stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); 	 
* The [[Uncle Tom]], or African American who is too eager to please white people (in the character of Uncle Tom). 	 

In addition to the book's stereotyping of black people, some critics highlight Stowe's paucity of life-experience relating to Southern life, which led her to create wrong descriptions of the region. For instance, she never set foot on a Southern plantation. However, Stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where Stowe lived. It is reported that, "She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed on the [[Ohio River]], including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the emerging plot." <ref>[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg149.htm University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Library.] Special collection page on traditions and interpretations of Uncle Tom's Cabin.</ref> 	 

In the last few decades these negative associations have to a large degree overshadowed the historical impact of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. From the viewpoint of history, the book was a vital antislavery tool that helped turn public opinion against slavery in the United States.

==Anti-Tom literature==
{{main|Anti-Tom literature}}
In response to ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', writers in the [[Southern United States]] began producing a number of books to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the evils of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over child-like slaves in a benevolent extended-family-style plantation. The novels either implied, or directly stated, the [[racist]] view that African Americans were a child-like people unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.<ref>''Whitewashing Uncle Tom's Cabin: nineteenth-century women novelists respond to Stowe'' by Joy Jordan-Lake, Vanderbilt University Press, 2005.</ref>

The two most famous anti-Tom books are ''[[The Sword and the Distaff]]'' by [[William Gilmore Simms]] and ''[[The Planter's Northern Bride]]'' by [[Caroline Lee Hentz]];<ref>"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4113/is_200501/ai_n9483519/pg_1 Caroline Lee Hentz's Long Journey]" by Philip D. Beidler. Alabama Heritage Number 75, Winter 2005.</ref> the latter author had been a close personal friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published a few months after Stowe's novel and it contains a number of sections and discussions that are clearly disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely-read at the time, but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a northern woman&mdash;the daughter of an abolitionist, no less&mdash;who marries a southern slave owner. 

In the decade between the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin and the start of the [[American Civil War]], between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books would be published. Among these novels are two books titled ''Uncle Tom's Cabin As It Is'' (one by W.L. Smith and the other by C.H. Wiley) and a book by [[John Pendleton Kennedy]].

=="Tom shows"==
[[Image:Stetson's Uncle Tom's Cabin - Eliza.jpg|thumb|1886 poster for "Stetson's ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''"]]

Given the lax copyright laws of the time, stage plays based on ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''&mdash;"Tom shows"&mdash;began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. These plays varied tremendously in their politics&mdash;some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery. Eric Lott estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, ten times the book's first-year sales. Some of these shows were essentially [[minstrel shows]] loosely based on the novel and their grossly exaggerated caricatures of black people further perpetuated some of the stereotypes that Stowe used.

Stowe herself never authorized dramatization of her work, because of [[puritan]]ical distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]]'s version, and, according to [[Francis Underwood]], was "delighted" by [[Caroline Howard]]'s portrayal of Topsy). Asa Hutchinson of the [[Hutchinson Family Singers]], whose antislavery politics closely matched those of Stowe tried and failed to get her permission to stage an official version; her refusal left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures. 

All "Tom shows" appear to have incorporated elements of [[melodrama]] and of [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. The first serious attempt at anything like a faithful stage adaptation was a one-hour play by C.W. Taylor at Purdy's National Theater ([[New York City]]); it ran for about ten performances in August&ndash;September 1852 sharing a bill with a blackface burlesque featuring   [[T.D. Rice]]. Rice, famous in the 1830s for his comic and clearly [[racism|racist]] blackface character [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]], later became the most celebrated actor to play the title role of Tom; when Rice opened in H.E. Stevens play of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in January 1854 at New York's Bowery Theatre, the ''[[Spirit of the Times]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' reviewer described him as "decidedly the best personator of negro character who has appeared in any drama."

The best-known "Tom Shows" were those of [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]] and [[H.J. Conway]]. Aiken's original ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' focused almost entirely on Little Eva (played by child star [[Cordelia Howard]]); a sequel, ''The Death of Uncle Tom, or the Religion of the Lonely'' told Tom's own story. The two were ultimately combined in an unprecedented evening-long six-act play. According to Lott, it is generally faithful to Stowe's novel, although it plays down the black trickster characters of Sam and Andy and variously adds or expands the roles of some farcical white characters instead. It also focuses heavily on George Harris; the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that his defiant speech received "great cheers" from an audience of Bowery [[b'hoy and g'hal|b'hoys and g'hals]]. Even this most sympathetic of "Tom shows" clearly borrowed heavily from minstrelsy: not only were the slave roles all played by white actors in blackface, but [[Stephen Foster]]'s "[[Old Folks at Home]]" was played in the scene where Tom is sold down the river. After a long and successful run beginning [[November 15]], 1852 in [[Troy, New York]], the play opened in New York City [[July 18]], 1853, where its success was even greater.

Conway's production opened in [[Boston]] the same day Aiken's opened in Troy; [[P.T. Barnum]] brought it to his American Museum in New York [[November 7]], 1853. Its politics were much more moderate. Sam and Andy become, in Lott's words, "buffoons". Criticism of slavery was placed largely in the mouth of a newly introduced [[Yankee]] character, a reporter named Penetrate Partyside. St. Clare's role was expanded, and turned into more of a pro-slavery advocate, articulating the politics of a [[John C. Calhoun]]. Legree rigs the auction that gets him ownership of Tom (as against Stowe's and Aiken's portrayal of oppression as the ''normal'' mode of slavery, not an abuse of the system by a cheater). Beyond this, Conway gave his play a happy ending, with Tom and various other slaves freed.

Showmen felt that Stowe's novel had a flaw in that there was no clearly defined comic character, so there was no role for a comedian, and consequently little relief from the tragedy. Eventually it was found that the minor character of Marks the Lawyer could be played as a broad charicature for laughs, dresing him in foppish clothes, often equipped with an incoungruously dainty umberella. Some productions even had him make an entrance mounted astride a large pig!

Among the pro-slavery "Tom shows" was ''Uncle Tom's Cabin as It Is: The Southern Uncle Tom'', produced in 1852 at the [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] Museum. Lott mentions numerous "offshoots, parodies, thefts, and rebuttals" including a full-scale play by [[Christy's Minstrels]] and a parody by Conway himself called ''Uncle Pat's Cabin'', and records that the story in its many variants "dominated northern popular culture‚Ä¶ for several years".

According to Eric Lott, even those "Tom shows" which stayed relatively close to Stowe's novel played down the [[feminism|feminist]] aspects of the book and Stowe's criticisms of capitalism, and turned her anti-slavery politics into anti-Southern sectionalism. Francis Underwood, a contemporary, wrote that Aiken's play had also lost the "lightness and gayety" of Stowe's book. Nonetheless, Lott argues, they increased sympathy for the slaves among the Northern white working class (which had been somewhat alienated from the abolitionist movement by its perceived elitist backing).

The influence of the "Tom shows" could also be found in a number of other plays through the 1850s: most obviously, C.W. Taylor's dramatization of Stowe's ''Dred'', but also J.T. Trowbridge's abolitionist play ''Neighbor Jackwood'', Dion Bouicault's ''The Octaroon'', and a play called ''The Insurrection'', based on [[John Brown (abolitionist)#Raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]].

==Cinematic versions==
[[Image:Babbuncletomscabin.jpg|right|thumb|A movie poster from [[Kroger Babb]]'s 1965 production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.]]''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' has been made into several film versions.

*The earliest was in 1903, directed by [[Siegmund Lubin]] and starring Lubin as [[Simon Legree]]. Another version, also released in 1903, was a 13-minute short directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]].
*In 1910, a version was directed by [[Barry O'Neil]] and starring [[Frank Hall Crane]] as [[Uncle Tom]], [[Anna Rosemond]] as [[Eliza (character)|Eliza]], [[Marie Eline]] as [[Little Eva (character)|Little Eva]] and [[Grace Eline]] as Topsy.
*Another version in 1910 was directed by [[J. Stuart Blackton]] and adapted by [[Eugene Mullin]]. It starred [[Florence Turner]], [[Mary Fuller]], [[Edwin R. Phillips]], [[Flora Finch]], [[Genevieve Tobin]] and [[Carlyle Blackwell Sr.]]
*A 1913 release was directed by [[Otis Turner]] and adapted by [[Allan Dwan]]. It starred [[Edward Alexander]], [[Margarita Fischer]], [[Harry A. Pollard]], [[Iva Shepard]] and [[Gertrude Short]].
*Another 1913 release was directed by [[Sidney Olcott]] and starred [[Anna Q. Nilsson]].
*A 1914 version was directed by [[William Robert Daly]]. It was adapted [[Edward McWade]] from the play adaptation by [[George L. Aiken]]. It starred [[Sam Lucas]], [[Teresa Michelena]], Marie Eline (again), [[Royce D. Applegate|Roy Applegate]] and [[Boots Wall]].
*A 1918 version was directed  and adapted by [[J. Searle Dawley]]. It starred [[Marguerite Clark]] (as both Little Eva '''''and''''' Topsy), [[Sam Hardy]], [[Florence Carpenter]], [[Frank Losee]] and [[Walter P. Lewis]].
*A 1927 version was directed by [[Harry A. Pollard]] and adapted by Pollard, [[Harvey F. Thew]] and [[A.P. Younger]], with titles by [[Walter Anthony]]. It starred [[James B. Lowe]], [[Virginia Grey]], [[George Siegmann]], Margarita Fischer (again), [[Mona Ray]] and [[Madame Sul-Te-Wan]].
The subject matter of the [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation for several years. A [[German language]] version, directed by [[G√©za von Radv√°nyi]], appeared in 1965 and was presented in the United States by [[exploitation film]] presenter [[Kroger Babb]], but there was no other film version until a [[television]] broadcast in 1987. That version was directed by [[Stan Lathan]] and adapted by [[John Gay (screenwriter)|John Gay]]. It starred [[Avery Brooks]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[Edward Woodward]], [[Jenny Lewis]] and [[Endyia Kinney]].

Characters from the novel were used in a 1919 [[Mack Sennett]] comedy directed by [[Edward F. Cline]] and [[Ray Hunt]], with [[Ben Turpin]] as Uncle Tom and [[Marie Prevost]] as Eliza.

The [[Walt Disney]] cartoon "[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]" (1933) features the classic Disney character roster playing a theatrical version of the novel.

A highlight of the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951) is a ballet, "Small House of Uncle Thomas", in traditional Siamese style which has been organized by Tuptim, on the subversive theme of Eliza's escape.

In ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002), [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]'s characters attend an imagined wartime adaptation of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' with a [[deus ex machina]] ending. An actor portraying Abraham Lincoln is suspended in mid-air as he speaks consolingly to the [[blackface]] actors portraying Stowe's characters. The [[Nativism|nativist]] audience members respond by shouting racist epithets, throwing objects at "Lincoln," and rioting to calls of "Down with the Union!"

In the [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon "[[Southern Fried Rabbit]]" (1953) Bugs disguises himself as Uncle Tom singing "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]" in order to cross the [[Mason-Dixon line]].

Stowe also offered a solution to a moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Were the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.

Sees novel as expressing the values of ideas of the Free Soil Movement. The character George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During the course of the novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (3 years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.

Argues Stowe used biological essentialism to explain the character of African Americans and as a basis for her critique of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.

States that Stowe sought to redefine masculinity as a necessary step toward the abolition of slavery. Many abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.
