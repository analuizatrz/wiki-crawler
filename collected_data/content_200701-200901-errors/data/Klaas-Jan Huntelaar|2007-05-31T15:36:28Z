'''Klaas Jan Huntelaar''' (born [[August 12]], [[1983]] in [[Drempt]], [[Gelderland]], [[Netherlands]]) is a Dutch [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who plays as a [[striker]] for [[Ajax Amsterdam]] and [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], where he has replaced [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] as striker after the latter fell out with coach [[Marco van Basten]]. He is seen as a rising star in Dutch football, having scored 33 goals in the [[Eredivisie 2005/2006|2005/06 Eredivisie campaign]], making him top scorer. His nickname is 'The Hunter'.

==Club career==
===PSV===
In 2000, aged 16, Huntelaar joined PSV Eindhoven’s academy and established himself as a prolific goalscorer for their youth team.

He made his debut for PSV during the first half of the 2002-2003 season but this was to prove his one and only Eredivisie appearance for the club.

===De Graafschap / AGOVV===
Having failed to establish himself in the first team he was loaned out to [[De Graafschap]] to gain experience. He made 9 Eredivisie appearances for ‘the Super Farmers’ but failed to score.

In the summer of 2003 Huntelaar was again loaned out. This time to [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]] in the Dutch First Division. He was an instant success scoring 26 times in his 35 league appearances and finished the season as the divisions top goalscorer.

===SC Heerenveen===
After the player turned down the opportunity to sign a new contract with PSV [[SC Heerenveen]] moved in to sign him for a transfer fee of €100,000. The following season he scored 17 goals in 31 matches to help Heerenveen qualify for the UEFA Cup. 2005/06 saw him score 17 goals in 15 matches, form which earned him a mid-season transfer to Ajax, who paid € 9 million + future incentives for the player. A substantial sum went to rivals [[PSV Eindhoven]] as a result of the training compensation rule imposed by [[FIFA]].

===Ajax===
[[Image:Huntelaar Trophy.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Celebrating victory in the [[KNVB Cup|Dutch Cup]] with Ajax]]
Huntelaar had an immediate impact at Ajax, scoring perhaps his most spectacular goal of the season, a [[bicycle kick]] in injury time of the [[KNVB Cup]] semifinal against [[Roda JC]], which squared the match and allowed Ajax to go on to victory after the extra periods. Huntelaar then went on to score a brace, including the winner, against PSV Eindhoven to bring Ajax its 16th KNVB Cup.

Huntelaar was the first player to score a goal at [[Arsenal F.C.]]'s new [[Emirates Stadium]] in a testimonial match for [[Dennis Bergkamp]] on [[July 22nd]], [[2006]] - a match Ajax ended up losing 2-1 (although in the second half, which started off with Ajax leading 1-0, 'legends' like [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Ian Wright]] played instead).

Huntelaar started the 2006/07 campaign by scoring a brace against Copenhagen in the first leg of the [[UEFA Champions League]] 3rd qualifying round. Huntelaar continued scoring this season, getting 21 goals in the league and four in the [[KNVB Cup]], including a goal in the final that Ajax went on to win. He also scored 9 goals out of 9 appearances in the Champions League and UEFA Cup.

===Possible transfer from Ajax===
Ajax issued a hands-off warning following speculation that [[Newcastle United]] was interested in signing the player in the January transfer window. <ref name="newcastle">{{cite news | title=Newcastle warned off Huntelaar and Emanuelson | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=393206&cc=5901 | publisher=ESPN Soccernet | date=[[2006-11-21]] | accessdate=2006-12-14}}</ref> [[Manchester United]] and [[Liverpool]] are also said to be very interested in the player. 
[[Juventus]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Olympique Lyonnais]] and [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] are also interested in signing the striker. <ref name="juve">{{cite news | title=Sosa And Huntelaar Followed By Juventus | url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=199480 | publisher=Goal.com| date=[[2006-12-28]] | accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref><ref name="arsenal">{{cite news | title=Juventus chief Bettega makes Huntelaar check  | url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=23225 | publisher=TribalFootball| date=[[2006-12-29]] | accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Strikers A Priority For Lyon  | url=http://www.soccer365.com/EUROPEAN_NEWS/Rest_of_Europe/page_109_134981.shtml | publisher=Soccer365| date=[[2007-01-15]] | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref><ref name="valencia">{{cite news | title=LOS TÉCNICOS DEL CLUB SIGUEN AL PUNTA DEL AJAX HUNTELAAR  | url=http://www.as.com/articulo/futbol/tecnicos/club/siguen/punta/Ajax/Huntelaar/dasftb/20070208dasdaiftb_24/Tes/ | publisher=AS| date=[[2007-02-08]] | accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref>

In an interview on March 22nd 2007, he told Italian newspaper "La Gazzetta dello Sport" that his idols were [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Dennis Bergkamp]] and today he loves AC Milan striker Filippo Inzaghi.<ref>{{cite news | title=Huntelaar: «Pronto per l'Italia» (Gazzetta dello Sport)  | url=http://www.goal.com/it/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=263389/ | publisher=Goal.com| date=[[2007-03-23]] | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

[[FC Barcelona]] are also interested in signing the striker, with a reported 4 year €15 million deal in the works. <ref>{{cite news | title=Nu ook Barcelona geïnteresseerd in Huntelaar  | url=http://www.v-bal.nl/nieuws/bekijk.php?id=21518 | publisher=V-Bal!| date=[[2007-03-22]] | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

==International career==
Despite being in the preliminary squad, Huntelaar was not chosen for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Coach [[Marco van Basten]] explained that he felt Huntelaar would benefit from more experience and from playing at the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2006|UEFA Under 21 football championships]], going as far as to say that it was up to Huntelaar to "show us there that [by not selecting Huntelaar] we did not do the right thing".{{Fact|date=March 2007}} While Holland went on to score no goals against quality opposition at the World Cup in Germany, Huntelaar led the Dutch to victory as the top-scorer of the Under 21 tournament with four goals, including a wonderful strike in the semi-final against France and a brace in the final against Ukraine. Huntelaar was named in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship#Player awards|UEFA Team of the Tournament]] as a striker.

Marco van Basten decided to call Huntelaar as his starting striker in the Dutch National squad's friendly against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on August 16, 2006. Huntelaar paid immediate dividends by scoring two goals (another one was disallowed by a controversial off-side call by the referee, denying him the hat-trick), and making two assists, in Holland's 4-0 victory.
