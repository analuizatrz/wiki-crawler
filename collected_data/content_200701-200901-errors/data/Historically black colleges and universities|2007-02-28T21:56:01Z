In the [[United States]], '''Historically black colleges and universities''' ('''HBCU''') are colleges or universities that were established before [[1964]] with the intention of serving the [[African American]] community. 
There are more than 100 historically black colleges in the United States, located almost exclusively in the [[U.S. Southern states|southern]] and [[U.S. Northeast|eastern]] states.  Four HBCUs are located in the [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] states (two each in [[Missouri]] and [[Ohio]]), while one is in the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]].

Conversely, many institutions that were founded (or opened their doors to African Americans) after ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case which outlawed [[racial segregation]] of [[public education facilities]], now count African Americans as a large part of their student body; however, by definition they are not '''historically''' black colleges. [[Chicago State University]] is a good example of this phenomenon.
