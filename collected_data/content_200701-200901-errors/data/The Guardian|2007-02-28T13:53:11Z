'''''The Guardian''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[newspaper]] owned by the [[Guardian Media Group]]. It is published Monday to Saturday in the [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] format. Until 1959 it was called '''''The Manchester Guardian''''', reflecting its provincial origins; the paper is still occasionally referred to by this name, especially in [[North America]] (to distinguish it from [[Guardian|other newspapers with similar names]]), although it has been based in [[London]] since 1964 (with printing facilities in both [[Manchester]] and [[London]]).

==Stance==
[[Editorial]] articles in ''The Guardian'' are generally in sympathy with the middle-ground liberal to left-wing end of the political spectrum. This is reflected in the paper's readership: a MORI Poll taken between April-June 2000 showed that 80% of ''Guardian'' readers were Labour Party voters (cited in ''[[International Socialism (journal)|International Socialism]]'' Spring 2003, ISBN 1-898876-97-5); according to another [[MORI]] poll taken in 2004, 44% of ''Guardian'' readers vote [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and 37% vote [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]<ref>MORI, 2005-03-09. "[http://www.mori.com/polls/2004/voting-by-readership.shtml Voting Intention by Newspaper Readership]"</ref>.

==Format==

Today ''The Guardian'' is the only British national newspaper to publish in full colour (although the edition printed in [[Northern Ireland]] still has much black-and-white content <ref>{{cite web

| accessdate = 2007-02-11}}</ref>); it was also the first newspaper in the UK to be printed on the [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] size. In November 2005 ''The Guardian'' had a certified average [[newspaper circulation|daily circulation]] of 378,618 copies (November 2005), as compared to sales of 904,955 for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 692,581 for ''[[The Times]]'', and 261,193 for ''[[The Independent]]''<ref>Audit Bureau of Circulations Ltd</ref>.

==Awards==
It has been awarded the ''National Newspaper of the Year'' in 1999 and 2006 by the [[British Press Awards]], as well as being co-winner of the ''World's Best-designed Newspaper'' as awarded by the Society for News Design (2006). The ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' website won the Best Newspaper category two years running in the 2005 and 2006 [[Webby Awards]], beating (in 2005) the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<ref>The Webby Awards, 2005. "[http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php#webby_entry_newspaper 9th Annual Webby Awards nominations and winners]."</ref>.  It has been the winner for six years in a row of the [[British Newspaper Awards]] for Best Electronic Daily Newspaper.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newspaperawards.co.uk/default.htm | title=The 2006 Newspaper Awards | accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref> The site won an [[Eppy]] award from the US-based magazine ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'' in 2000 for the best-designed newspaper online service <ref>Eppy Awards, 2000. "[http://royal.reliaserve.com/eppy/winners2000.html Winners]."</ref>.  The website is well-known and recognised for its commentary on sporting events, particularly its over-by-over cricket commentary.

==Ownership==
''The Guardian'' is part of the [[Guardian Media Group]] of newspapers, radio stations, and new media including ''[[The Observer]]'' Sunday newspaper, the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', [[Money Observer]] financial magazine, [[the Guardian Weekly]] International newspaper, [[Guardian Monthly]] magazine, [[Guardian Abroad]] website, and ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'', one of the most popular online news resources on the Internet{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. All the aforementioned are owned by [[Scott Trust|The Scott Trust]], a charitable foundation which aims to ensure the newspaper's editorial independence in perpetuity, maintaining its financial health to ensure it does not become vulnerable to take over by for-profit media groups, and the serious compromise of editorial independence that this often brings. 

The Guardian has been consistently loss-making.  The National Newspaper division of GMG, which also includes ''The Observer'', reported operating losses of £49.9m in 2006, up from £18.6m in 2005.<ref>Guardian Media Group plc 2006. "[http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/gmgplc/media/news/article/article110.html Guardian Media Group 2005/6 results]."</ref> The paper is therefore heavily dependent on cross-subsidisation from profitable companies within the group, including ''Auto Trader'' and the ''Manchester Evening News''.

The Guardian's ownership by the Scott Trust is likely a factor in it being the only British national daily to conduct (since 2003) an annual social, ethical and environmental [[audit]] in which it examines, under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor, its own behaviour as a company.<ref>Guardian Newspapers Ltd & Scott Trust, 2005. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit Social, ethical and environmental audit, 2005]."</ref>

The ''Guardian'' and its parent groups participate in [[Project Syndicate]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/ | title=Project Syndicate | accessdate=2006-04-04}}</ref> established by [[George Soros]], and intervened in 1995 to save the ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' in [[South Africa]], but Guardian Media Group sold the majority of its shares in the ''Mail & Guardian'' in 2002.

==History==
===Political alignment and controversies===
[[Image:GuardianNewsroom.jpg|thumb|right|''The Guardian'''s Newsroom visitor centre and archive (No 60), with an old sign with the name ''The Manchester Guardian'']]
The ''Manchester Guardian'' was founded in Manchester in 1821 by a group of [[non-conformist]] businessmen headed by [[John E. Taylor|John Edward Taylor]].  The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that "it will zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty … it will warmly advocate the cause of Reform; it will endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy; and to support, without reference to the party from which they emanate, all serviceable measures." 

Its most famous editor, [[Charles Prestwich Scott|C P Scott]], made the ''Manchester Guardian'' into a nationally famous newspaper. He was editor for 57 years from 1872, and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor's son in 1907. Under Scott the paper's moderate editorial line became more radical, supporting Gladstone when the Liberals split in 1886, and opposing the [[Second Boer War]] against popular opinion.  

Scott's friendship with [[Chaim Weizmann]] played a role in the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]], and in 1948 the ''Guardian'' was a supporter of the State of [[Israel]]. The story of the relationship between the ''Guardian'' and the [[zionist]] movement and Israel is told in Daphna Baram's book "Disenchantment: The ''Guardian'' and Israel".<ref>{{cite book | title=Disenchantment: The ''Guardian'' and Israel | author=Daphna Baram | authorlink=Daphna Baram | publisher=Politico | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-84275-119-0}}</ref>

In June 1936 ownership of the paper was transferred to the [[Scott Trust]] (named after the last owner, John Russell Scott, who was the first chairman of the Trust). This move ensured the paper's independence, and it was then noted for its eccentric style, its moralising and its detached attitude to its finances.

Traditionally affiliated with the centrist [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], and with a northern circulation base, the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the [[Spanish Civil War]], when along with the Liberal ''[[News Chronicle]]'', the Labour ''[[Daily Herald]]'', the Communist ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and several Sunday and weekly papers it supported the republicans against the insurgent [[nationalists]] led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. Consistent in its anti-establishment stance, the Guardian also provided one of the few probing and dissenting voices during the 1957 [[Suez Crisis]]. 

In 1983 the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of [[cruise missiles]] in Britain that were leaked to the Guardian by civil servant [[Sarah Tisdall]].  The Guardian eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities, which resulted in a prison sentence for Tisdall.

In 1995, both the [[Granada Television]] programme ''[[World In Action]]'' and ''The Guardian'' were sued for [[libel]] by the then cabinet minister [[Jonathan Aitken]], for their allegation that the [[Saudi]] Prince [[Mohammed bin Fahd]] had paid for Aitken and his wife to stay at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Hôtel Ritz]] in [[Paris]], which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on Aitken's part. Aitken publicly stated he would fight with "the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play".<ref>Jonathan Aitken, 1995. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/aitken/Story/0,2763,208516,00.html The simple sword of truth]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> The court case proceeded, and in 1997 ''The Guardian'' produced evidence that Aitken's claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue.<ref>Luke Harding and David Pallister, 1997 "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/aitken/Story/0,2763,208503,00.html He lied and lied and lied]" ''The Guardian''.</ref> In 1999, Aitken was jailed for [[perjury]] and [[perverting the course of justice]].<ref>BBC News, 1999. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/258070.stm Aitken pleads guilty to perjury]."</ref>

During the [[United States war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] wars ''The Guardian'' attracted a significant proportion of anti-war readers as one of the mass-media media outlets most critical of UK and USA military initiatives.

Despite its early support for the Zionist movement, in recent decades the Guardian has often been perceived as critical of Israel.  In December 2003 journalist [[Julie Burchill]] left the paper for ''[[The Times]]'', citing this as one of the reasons for her move.<ref>Julie Burchill, 29 November 2003. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1094420,00.html Good bad and ugly]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>  
In a recent controversy, the paper has been accused by [[Alan Dershowitz]] writing in the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' of bias and failure to print corrections of mis-statements of fact in their articles and editorials.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/1136739501.html?dids=1136739501:1136739501&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+28%2C+2006&author=ALAN+DERSHOWITZ&pub=Jerusalem+Post&edition=&startpage=16&desc=%27The+Guardian%27+at+the+crossroads | title='The Guardian' at the crossroads | publisher=Jerusalem Post | date=September 27, 2006}}</ref> This allegation was denied by the Guardian's foreign editor, Harriet Sherwood, who says the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the Israel-Palestine conflict.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit/story/0,,1931208,00.html | title=News coverage | publisher=The Guardian | date=October 25, 2006}}</ref>  

In August 2004, for the [[US presidential election, 2004|US presidential election]], the daily G2 supplement, edited by [[Ian Katz]], launched an experimental letter-writing campaign in [[Clark County, Ohio|Clark County]], [[Ohio]], a small county in a [[swing state]]. Katz bought a voter list from the county for $25 and asked people to write to those on the list undecided in the election and, giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of making the correct decision.  There was something of a [[backlash]] to this campaign, and on [[21 October]], [[2004]], the paper retired it.

In October 2004 ''The Guardian'' published a humour column by [[Charlie Brooker]] in its entertainment guide, which appeared to call for the assassination of US President [[George W. Bush]].<ref>CNS News, 25 October 2004."[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200410%5CPOL20041025a.html Left-Wing UK Paper Pulls Bush Assassination Column]."</ref>  This caused some controversy and the paper was forced to issue an apology and remove the article from its website.<ref>Charlie Brooker, 24 October 2004."[http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguide/tvradio/story/0,14676,1335307,00.html Screen Burn, The Guide]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>

Following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], ''The Guardian'' published an article on its comment pages by [[Dilpazier Aslam]], a 27 year old British [[Muslim]] journalism trainee from [[Yorkshire]].<ref>Dilpazier Aslam, 2005-07-13. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1527323,00.html We rock the boat]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> Aslam was a member of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], an [[Islamist]] group, and had published a number of articles on their website.  According to the paper, it did not know that Aslam was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir when he applied to become a trainee, though several staff members were informed of this once he started at the paper.<ref>Media Guardian, 2005-07-22. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1534494,00.html Background: the Guardian and Dilpazier Aslam]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> The [[Home Office]] has claimed the group's "ultimate aim is the establishment of an [[Islamic]] state (Caliphate), according to Hizb ut-Tahrir via non-violent means". ''The Guardian'' asked Aslam to resign his membership of the group and, when he did not do so, terminated his employment.<ref>Steve Busfield, 2005-07-22. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,1534480,00.html Dilpazier Aslam leaves Guardian]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>

Overall, nevertheless, the paper is generally held up as an example of good journalism and its comment and opinion pages, though dominated by left-liberal writers and academics like Polly Toynbee, allows significant space for right of centre voices such as Simon Jenkins.

===Format and distribution===
The first edition was published on [[May 5]], [[1821]],<ref>Schoolnet n.d. "[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRguardian.htm Manchester Guardian]."</ref> at which time the ''Guardian'' was a weekly, published on Saturdays and costing 7[[penny|d]].; the [[stamp duty]] on newspapers (4[[penny|d]]. per sheet) forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently. When the stamp duty was cut in 1836 the ''Guardian'' added a Wednesday edition; with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d.

In 1952 the paper took the step of printing news on the front page, replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space. The editor [[Alfred Powell Wadsworth|AP Wadsworth]] wrote: "It is not a thing I like myself, but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion."

[[Image:GuardianHQLondon0.jpg|thumb|left|''The Guardian'''s offices in London]]
In 1959 the paper dropped "Manchester" from its title, becoming simply ''The Guardian'', and in 1964 it moved to [[London]], losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the less intellectual but much more profitable ''[[Manchester Evening News]]''. The financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s; at one time it was in merger talks with ''The Times''. The paper consolidated its [[centre-left]] stance during the 1970s and 1980s but was both shocked and revitalised by the launch of ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1986 which competed for a similar readership and provoked the entire broadsheet industry into a fight for circulation.

On [[12 February]] [[1988]] ''The Guardian'' had a significant redesign; as well as improving the quality of its printers' ink, it also changed its masthead to the now familiar juxtaposition of an [[Italic type|italic]] [[Garamond]] "''The''", with a bold [[Helvetica]] "Guardian", which remained in use until the [[2005]] redesign.

In 1992 it relaunched its features section as G2, a tabloid-format supplement. This innovation was widely copied by the other "quality" broadsheets, and ultimately led to the rise of "compact" papers and ''The Guardian'''s move to the Berliner format. In 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet 'price war' started by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s ''The Times''. In June 1993, ''The Guardian'' bought ''[[The Observer]]'' from [[Lonrho]], thus gaining a serious Sunday newspaper partner with similar political views.

[[Image:GuardianHQLondon1.jpg|thumb|right|''The Guardian'''s offices in London]]
Its international weekly edition is now titled ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'', though it retained the title ''Manchester Guardian Weekly'' for some years after the home edition had moved to London. It includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat left-of-centre inclination, including ''[[Le Monde]]''. The Guardian Weekly is also linked to a website for expatriates [[Guardian Abroad]].

In 2004, ''The Guardian'' introduced an online digital version of its print edition, allowing readers to download pages from the last 14 issues as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] files.

==Moving to the Berliner paper format==
[[Image:GuardianLastBroadsheet20050910.jpg|thumb|right|The last [[broadsheet]] edition of ''The Guardian'', along with a preview of the [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] format and its competitor ''[[The Independent]]'', all from [[2005-09-10]]. A sheet of [[A4 paper]] is shown for scale.]] In 2004, ''The Guardian'' announced plans to change to a "[[Berliner (format)|Berliner]]" or "[[midi (newspaper)|midi]]" format similar to that used by ''[[Le Monde]]'' in France and some other [[Europe]]an papers; at 470&times;315&nbsp;mm, this is slightly larger than a traditional [[tabloid]]. Planned for the autumn of 2005, this change was either a response to, or has the same cause as, the moves by ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' to start publishing in tabloid (or compact) format. On Thursday [[1 September]] [[2005]] ''The Guardian'' announced that it would launch the new format on Monday [[12 September]] [[2005]].<ref>Claire Cozens, 2005-09-01. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1560525,00.html New-look Guardian launches on September 12]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> Sister Sunday newspaper ''The Observer'' went over to the same format on [[8 January]] [[2006]]. 

The advantage that ''The Guardian'' saw in the Berliner format was that though it is only a little wider than a tabloid, and is thus equally easy to read on [[public transport]], its greater height gives more flexibility in page design. The new presses mean that printing can go right across the 'gutter', the strip down the middle of the centre page, allowing the paper to print striking double page pictures. The new presses also made the paper the first UK national able to print in full colour on every page.

The format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the paper's look. On Friday [[9 September]] [[2005]] the newspaper unveiled its new look front page, which débuted on Monday [[12 September]] [[2005]]. Designed by [[Mark Porter]], the new look includes a new [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]] for the newspaper, its first since 1988. A typeface family called Guardian Egyptian, designed by [[Paul Barnes (designer)]] and [[Christian Schwartz]], was created for the new design. No other typeface is used anywhere in the paper - all stylistic variations are based on various forms of Guardian Egyptian.

The switch cost Guardian Newspapers £80 million and involved setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester. This was because prior to the Guardian's move, no printing presses in the UK could produce newspapers in the Berliner format. There were additional complications as one of the Guardian's presses was part-owned by groups responsible for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Daily Express]]'', and it was contracted to use the plant until 2009. Another press was shared with the [[Guardian Media Group]]'s north western local tabloid papers, which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format.

The new format was generally well received by Guardian readers, who were asked to feedback on the changes. The only controversial issue was the dropping of the [[Doonesbury]] cartoon strip. The Guardian reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss and within 24 hours, the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week. Section editor [[Ian Katz]], who was responsible for dropping it, apologised in the editors' blog saying, "I'm sorry, once again, that I made you - and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments' address - so cross" [http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit/story/0,,1600349,00.html Guardian Unlimited - Guardian Reborn]. Some readers are however dissatisfied as the earlier deadline needed for the all-colour sports section has meant that coverage of late-finishing evening football matches is less satisfactory than before the redesign in the editions supplied to some parts of the country.

The investment was rewarded with a circulation rise. In December 2005, the average daily sale stood at 380,693, nearly 6% higher than the figure for December 2004.<ref>Claire Cozens, 2006-01-13. "[http://media.guardian.co.uk/circulationfigures/story/0,,1685936,00.html Telegraph sales hit all-time low]." ''The Guardian''.</ref> In 2006 the US-based [[Society for News Design]] voted the ''Guardian'' and Polish daily ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'' as the best-designed newspapers in the world, choosing them from 389 entries from 44 countries.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1714643,00.html | title=Guardian wins design award | author=Steve Busfield | date=February 21, 2006 | publisher=Guardian}}</ref>

[[Image:Daily-guardian.png|thumb|right|150px|''The Guardian''' on a weekday]]
On each weekday ''The Guardian'' comes with the G2 supplement containing feature articles, columns, television and radio listings, and the quick crossword. Since the change to the Berliner format, there is a separate daily Sport section. Other regular supplements during the week include:
; Monday : MediaGuardian, Office Hours

; Tuesday : EducationGuardian

; Wednesday : SocietyGuardian (covers the British [[public sector]] and related issues)

; Thursday : TechnologyGuardian

; Friday : Film & Music

; Saturday : The Guide (a weekly [[listings magazine]]), Weekend (the [[colour supplement]]), Review (covers [[literature]]), Money, Work, Rise (covering careers for new graduates), Travel, Family

Though the main news section was in the large broadsheet format, the supplements were all in the half-sized [[tabloid]] format, with the exception of the glossy ''Weekend'' section which was a 290×245mm magazine and ''The Guide'' which was in a small 225×145mm format.

With the change of the main section to the Berliner format, the specialist sections are now printed as Berliner, as is a now-daily Sports section, but G2 has moved to a "magazine-sized" demi-Berliner format. A Thursday Technology section and daily science coverage in the news section replaced Life and Online. ''Weekend'' and ''The Guide'' are still in the same small formats as before the change.

Monday through Thursday, the supplements carry substantial quantities of recruitment advertising as well as editorial on their specialised topics.

===Online media===
{{main|Guardian Unlimited}}
''The Guardian'' publishes all of its news online, with free access both to current news and an archive of three million stories.  A third of the site's hits are for items over a month old<ref>Emily Bell, 2005-10-08. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1587517,00.html Editor's Week]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>.  The website also offers [[PDF]] editions of the newspaper for a monthly subscription fee.  Free, unrestricted access has been cited as one of factors in the site's popularity.

''The Guardian'' also has a [[Guardian Unlimited Talk|number of talkboards]] that are noted for their mix of political disussion and whimsy. They were spoofed in the ''Guardian's'' own regular humorous ''Chatroom'' column in G2. The spoof column purported to be excerpts from a chatroom on [http://permachat.co.uk permachat.co.uk], a real URL which points to ''The Guardian'''s talkboards.

Possibly the most exciting feature of its online presence is the blog '[[Comment is Free]]' section where the public is invited to join in rigorous and sometimes bad-tempered debates about political issues. The debates are triggered by articles by Guardian columnists and contributors, many of which end up facing heavy criticism from readers.

''The Guardian'' has also launched a dating website, [[Soulmates]], and is experimenting with new media, offering a free twelve part weekly [[Podcast]] series by [[Ricky Gervais]]<ref>Jason Deans, 2005-12-08.

==''The Guardian'' in the popular imagination==
The name the '''''Grauniad''''' for the paper originated with the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''; it came about because of a reputation for text mangling, technical typesetting failures and typographical errors, hence the popular myth that the paper once misspelled its own name on the page one masthead as "''The Gaurdian'', though many recall the more inventive ''The Grauniad''". Although such errors are now less frequent than they used to be, owing to the end of hot-metal typesetting, the 'Corrections and clarifications' column can still often provide some amusement. There were even a number of errors in the first issue, perhaps the most notable being a notification that there would soon be some goods sold at ''atction'' instead of ''auction''.

Until the foundation of the ''Independent'', the ''Guardian'' was the only broadsheet national daily newspaper in Britain that was not clearly Conservative in its political affiliation{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. The term "''Guardian'' reader" is therefore often used pejoratively by those who do not agree with the paper or self-deprecatingly by those who do. The stereotype of a ''Guardian'' reader is a person with leftist or liberal politics rooted in the 1960s, working in the public sector, regularly eating [[lentil]]s and [[muesli]], living in north [[London]] (especially [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and [[Islington]]), wearing [[Sandal (footwear)|sandals]] and believing in [[alternative medicine]] and [[natural medicine]] as evidenced by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Kevin Hughes]]'s largely [[rhetorical question]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[November 19]], [[2001]]:

<blockquote>"Does my right hon. Friend find it bizarre — as I do — that the yoghurt- and muesli-eating, ''Guardian''-reading fraternity are only too happy to protect the [[human rights]] of people engaged in [[terrorism|terrorist]] acts, but never once do they talk about the human rights of those who are affected by them?"<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo011119/debtext/11119-08.htm#11119-08_spnew3 Hansard 374:54 2001-11-19].</ref></blockquote>

The ''Guardian'''s [[science]] coverage is now extensive. At the same time, the paper appears to have moved away from covering alternative therapies. Its ''Weekend'' supplement featured a column by [[Emma Mitchell]], a natural health therapist, until August 2006 and G2 was, until the relaunch, home to [[Edzard Ernst|Edzard Ernst's]] weekly column on complementary medicine (Ernst is professor of complementary medicine at the [[Medical school (United Kingdom)|Peninsula Medical School]], <ref>Sarah Boseley, 2003-09-26 "[http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,1392,1048903,00.html The alternative professor]." ''The Guardian''.</ref>), the paper now carries the debunking ''Bad Science''<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/
| title = Bad Science
| publisher = The Guardian
| accessdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref>
column by [[Ben Goldacre]] and a quizzical column in G2 called ''The Sceptic'',<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1585944,00.html
| title = The sceptic
| publisher = The Guardian
| accessdate =  2007-02-11}}</ref> which looks at the evidence for popular treatments and remedies (and Ernst took an [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] approach to appraisal of alternative therapies in his column). As alternative and [[complementary medicine]] has become more widely accepted most of the quality dailies now feature at least one column or writer devoted to the subject.

The [[stereotype]] of the Guardian reader is, however, a persistent feature of British political discourse. Even [[Physician|doctor]]s have perpetuated it by using the acronym ''GROLIES'' (Guardian Reader Of Low Intelligence in Ethnic Skirt) on patient notes.<ref>''BBC News'', 2003-08-18. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3159813.stm Doctor slang is a dying art]."</ref>

''The Guardian'', along with other British news outlets, has a tradition of [[Parody|spoof]] articles on [[April Fool's Day]], sometimes contributed by regular advertisers such as [[BMW]]. The most elaborate of these was a travel supplement on [[San Serriffe]], whilst an article in the ''Guardian'' dated [[April 1]] [[2006]] written by one Olaf Priol suggested that [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]] would be supporting the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] at the next [[General Election]] and had already written a campaign song for them.  Olaf Priol is an [[anagram]] of April Fool.

===References in fiction===
*In the play ''[[Hobson's Choice]]'' Henry Horatio Hobson worries that his reputation will be in tatters after '[[trespassing]]'.  He comments that if the news were to be intercepted by the ''Manchester Guardian'' then everyone would know. 
*The 1984 Christmas special of ''[[Yes Minister]]'' shows a number of newspapers tipping Jim Hacker as the next Prime Minister. ''The Guardian'' is among them, but its name is spelt ''The Gaurdian''. In Episode 6 a group of pro-[[badger]] protesters tell [[James Hacker|Jim Hacker]] that the Guardian told them the area they are fighting to save has been inhabitated by badgers for centuries. In fact Hacker points out jokingly the "[[bodgers]]" have lived there for centuries, satirising the Guardian's reputation for spelling errors.
*In Episode 4 of the second series of ''[[Yes Minister|Yes, Prime Minister]]'', Jim Hacker says:
:"I know exactly who reads the papers:  ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' is read by people who think they run the country; ''The Guardian'' is read by people who think they ought to run the country; ''[[The Times]]'' is read by people who actually do run the country; ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' is read by the wives of the people who run the country; ''[[The Financial Times]]'' is read by people who own the country; ''[[The Morning Star]]'' is read by people who think the country ought to be run by [[USSR|another country]]; and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' is read by people who think it is."
:[[Humphrey Appleby|Sir Humphrey]]: "Prime Minister, what about the people who read ''[[The Sun]]''?"
:[[Bernard Woolley]]: "''Sun'' readers don't care who runs the country, as long as she's got big tits."
*In the ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|Young Ones]]'' episode "Boring," Rick eagerly notes that ''The Guardian'' has an article on how to get an increased [[student grant]]. Unfortunately the paper has totally mangled the spelling of a key part of it, leaving Rick with no idea how to get the increased grant. Worse still, the misspelling happens to sound the same as a Satanic chant, so that when Neil repeats what Rick read out loud he accidentally summons a demon who tries to kill everyone there.
*In the ''[[Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', an entire planet goes into hibernation to wait out a galactic recession, only reviving themselves when the stock market reaches a satisfactorily high level for their needs. "Arthur [Dent], a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked by this."
*In the [[Sandy Duncan]] episode in the first season of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', [[Statler]] demonstrates his extreme age by not using the post-1959 name:
:[[Statler & Waldorf|Waldorf]]: Statler, do you 'get' the banana sketch?
:Statler: No, I get ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''The Manchester Guardian''.

==Literary and media awards==

In recent years it has also sponsored the [[Hay Festival]] in [[Hay-on-Wye]]. In addition, the annual [[Guardian Student Media Awards]], founded 1999, recognise excellence in journalism and design of British [[university]] and college [[student newspapers]], magazines and websites.
