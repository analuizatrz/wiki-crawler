'''James 'Jim' Hermiston''' (born 30 September 1947 in [[Edinburgh]]) is a former professional footballer and police officer.  He played for [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in Scotland and a number of clubs in [[Australia]] - he most notably won the 1970 [[Scottish Cup]] with [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], and was inducted into the [[Aberdeen F.C.#AFC Hall of Fame|Aberdeen FC "Hall of Fame"]] as one of the founding members in 2003.He also served with the police forces in the north of Scotland and [[Queensland]].

==Football career==

Hermiston began his career as a teenager with [[Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic F.C.|Bonnyrigg Rose]], and was signed for Aberdeen by [[Eddie Turnbull]] in 1965.  He made his debut for Aberdeen the following year, and went on to play 270 times for the club in all competitions.  He was a member of the [[Scottish Cup 1969-70|1969-70 Scottish Cup]] winning team, and was captain of the side toward the end of his time there<ref name="Legends"/>.

Hermiston was overlooked for the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland squad]] for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]], and this led him to seek a move to England.  However, a proposed transfer to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] failed to materialise, and Hermiston decided to retire from the game at the age of 27 to join [[Grampian Police]] as a Police Constable.  It is possible that as a PC, his duties may have included policing matches at Aberdeen's ground, [[Pittodrie Stadium]], but it is not clear whether he ever actually did so.<ref name ="Legends">{{cite book| first=Paul| last=Smith| title=The Legends of Aberdeen| publisher=Breedon Books| year=2007| id=ISBN  978 1 85983 575 3| page=81}}</ref>

Hermiston and his family emigrated to Australia shortly afterwards, and he resumed his football career there, playing for [[Grange Thistle]], then [[Brisbane City Soccer Club|Brisbane City]] and [[Brisbane Lions SC|Brisbane Lions]] before returning to police work after a brief spell as manager of Brisbane City<ref>[http://www.ozfootball.net/museum/coachmgr.html "Soccer's sacrificial lambs... the coaches", Australian Online Soccer Museum]</ref>.

Hermiston was a popular player in Australia, to the extent of having a children's coaching manual published under his name<ref name ="Book"> {{cite book| first=Jim| last=Hermiston| title=Jim Hermiston's Pioneer Hi-Fi Book of SOCCERskill| publisher=Queensland Newspapers Pty. Ltd.| year=1978| id=ISBN 0 9596903 1 X}}</ref>.  He was twice in [[Philips Cup]] winning teams, and was even considered as a potential captain of the [[Australia national football (soccer) team|Australian team]] <ref name ="Legends"/>.  However, this did not come to pass thanks to Hermiston having played part of a game for the Scottish Under-23 side in the early 1970s - the international rules at the time forbidding a player who had represented one country at any level from representing another.  He also played one game for the Scottish League representative side, a 5-0 defeat by the English League team at [[Maine Road]], Manchester on March 20th, 1974.<ref>[http://www.londonhearts.com/sfl/players/jimhermiston.html Jim Hermiston - Scotland Football League record]</ref>.

==Police career==

After emigrating to Australia, Hermiston joined the [[Queensland Police]], and served with that force until his retirement in 2003.  In 1999, he was presented with a bravery award after intervening in a bank robbery while off duty<ref name="Legends"/>.
