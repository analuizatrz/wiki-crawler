The '''Sex Pistols''' are an [[England|English]] [[punk rock]] [[Band (music)|band]] that formed in [[London]] in 1975. The band originally comprised vocalist [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]], guitarist [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], drummer [[Paul Cook]] and bassist [[Glen Matlock]] (replaced by [[Sid Vicious]]). Although their initial career lasted only three years and produced only four singles and one studio album, ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]]'', the Sex Pistols have been described by the [[BBC]] as "the definitive English punk rock band."<ref name="BBC1">{{cite web | author= Artist Profiles | year=| title="Artist Profiles: Sex Pistols"| work=BBC.co.uk| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/profiles/sexpistols.shtml | accessmonthday= September 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The Pistols are widely credited with initiating the punk movement in the [[United Kingdom]]<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=| title="The birth of punk" | work=Independent News and Media Limited (UK)| url=http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/features/article324977.ece | accessmonthday= September 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and creating the first [[generation gap]] within [[rock and roll]].<ref name="Robb2">{{cite web | author= Robb, John| year= 2005 | title="The Birth of Punk" | work=The Independent (UK)| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051105/ai_n15761493/pg_1 | accessmonthday= October 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Their 1977 single "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" was regarded as an attack on the [[British monarchy]] and British [[nationalism]].<ref name "nat">{{cite web | author= | year= 2001| title="Artists A-Z" | work=BBC Radio 1| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/s/sexpistols/# | accessmonthday= October 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Rotten left the band in January 1978, amid a turbulent tour of the [[United States]]; the remaining trio carried on for the remainder of the year with vocals by Jones, [[Edward Tudor-Pole]] and [[Ronnie Biggs]] but disbanded in early 1979. With Lydon, they reunited in 1996 for the "Filthy Lucre" tour and have staged subsequent reunion tours in 2002, 2003 and 2007. On [[24 February]] [[2006]], the Sex Pistols were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum "a piss stain".<ref>{{cite web | last=Sprague| first=David| date= [[24 February]] [[2006]]| title="Sex Pistols Flip Off Hall of Fame " | work=Rolling Stone | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9385165/sex_pistols_flip_off_hall_of_fame| accessdaymonth= 21 February | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

== History == 
=== Origins and early days ===
The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a band formed in 1972 with Jones on vocals, Cook on drums and [[Wally Nightingale]] on guitar. Early line-ups also included Jim Mackin (now a [[GP]] practising in Lincolnshire) on organ, as well as Stephen Hayes, and later Del Noones, on bass.<ref name="Anarchist">O'Shea, Mick, "The Early Days of the Sex Pistols: "Only Anarchists Are Pretty"", Helter Skelter Publishing (2004), p. 29. ISBN 1-900924-93-5. </ref> By 1973 the band members were spending time at [[Don Letts|Don Letts's]] [[Acme Attractions]] and the more upmarket [[SEX (boutique)|Let It Rock]], a 1950s-themed clothes shop in the [[Kings Road]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], area of London. Let It Rock was owned by former [[New York Dolls]] manager [[Malcolm McLaren]] and his partner [[Vivienne Westwood]]; the shop specialised in "anti-fashion", selling the drapes, slashed T-shirts, [[brothel creepers]] and [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] gear later popularised by the punk movement.<ref name="thesexpistol"/><ref name="Robb"/> As Rotten observed, "Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto."<ref name="Robb"/> The shop was to become a focal point of the punk rock scene, bringing together many of its primary members: [[Jordan (Pamela Rooke)|Jordan]], [[Soo Catwoman]], [[Captain Sensible]], John Ritchie (later Sid Vicious), [[Jah Wobble]], [[Gene October]], [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]], [[Tony James]] and [[Marco Pirroni]],<ref name="Robb"/> all reacting against the fashion of long hair and flared jeans that prevailed in the early 1970s.  
    
McLaren took over management of the band around this time. Renamed The Swankers,<ref name="Frame">Frame, Pete, "The Complete Rock Family Trees", Omnibus Press (1993), p. 29. ISBN 0-7119-3449-5.</ref> they began rehearsing at the Crunchy Frog, a studio near the [[London Docklands]]. In 1974, they played their first gig at Tom Salter's Café in London. Noones was ejected from the band shortly afterwards, due to his unreliability and unwillingness to rehearse.<ref name="Anarchist"/>

=== Johnny Rotten joins the band ===
[[Image:John Destroy.jpg|thumb|right|Johnny Rotten, ca. 1977, photographed by Dennis Morris]]
Glen Matlock was recruited as bass player in early 1975. Around this time Jones and Nightingale began to argue over the band's musical direction, and Nightingale departed soon afterwards. In August 1975, [[John Lydon]] (Johnny Rotten) was spotted by Jones at the now renamed and restyled SEX boutique. According to Jones, "He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate [[Pink Floyd]]' T-shirt on. John had something special, but when he spoke he was a real asshole—but smart."<ref name="jlydon">Lydon, John. "No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs", Keith & Kent Zimmerman, [[St. Martin's Press]], May 1994. ISBN 0-312-11883-X </ref> Though he had never considered singing before, after miming along to [[Alice Cooper]]'s "[[I'm Eighteen]]" on the shop juke box, Rotten was asked to join as vocalist.<ref name="savage"> Savage, Jon, "England's Dreaming: The Sex Pistols and Punk Rock", [[Faber and Faber]], 1991. ISBN 0-312-28822-0</ref> Rotten and his circle of friends were by now dressing in the torn-shirt, [[Sadomasochism|S&M]]-inspired clothing promoted by Vivienne Westwood.<ref name="BBC1">{{cite web | author= Bell-Price, Shannon | year=2006| title="Vivienne Westwood and the Postmodern Legacy of Punk Style"| work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vivw/hd_vivw.htm | accessmonthday= October 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The band's core group of followers—including [[Siouxsie Sioux]], [[Steve Severin]] and [[Billy Idol]], who would go on to form bands of their own—came to be known as the [[Bromley Contingent]], after the neighborhood several were from.<ref name="bctg">{{cite web | author= | year=| title="The Bromley Contingent"| work=punk77.co.uk| url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/bromley.htm| accessmonthday= October 9 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Their radical fashion ignited a trend that was adopted by the new fans the band attracted.<ref name="savage"/>

''[[NME]]'' journalist [[Nick Kent]] used to jam occasionally with the band, but left upon Rotten's recruitment. According to Rotten, "When I came along, I took one look at him and said, 'No. That has to go.' He's never written a good word about me since"<ref name="jlydon" /> Following Kent's departure, Cook began to feel that Jones might not be capable enough alone on guitar, and the band placed an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'': "Wanted—Whizz kid guitarist, Not older than 20, Not worse looking than [[Johnny Thunders]]" (referring to a leading member of the New York punk scene).<ref name="mlock"> Matlock, Glen and Silverton, Peter,  "I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol", Omnibus Press, 1990</ref> Steve New answered the advert, and played with the band for a few weeks, before he too departed. 

One of McLaren's first acts as manager was to rename the band. Among the options considered were Le Bomb, Subterraneans, Beyond and Teenage Novel. The band's first gig as the Sex Pistols was arranged by Matlock, who was studying at [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design|Saint Martins College]]. The band played at the school on [[6 November]] [[1975]].<ref name="Frame"/> The plugs were pulled before they finished their set.  This gig was followed by other performances at colleges and art schools around London. 

In early 1976, the Sex Pistols began to play larger venues such as the [[100 Club]] and the Nashville. On [[4 June]] [[1976]], at the invitation of [[Howard Devoto]] and [[Pete Shelley]] (who would soon form the [[Buzzcocks]]), the band played their first gig in [[Manchester]]. Their performance at the [[Free Trade Hall|Lesser Free Trade Hall]] inspired a punk rock boom in the city.<ref name="davidnolan"> Nolan, David,  "I Swear I Was There: The Gig That Changed the World", Independent Music Press, 2007. ISBN 0-9549-7049-7</ref> Two newly formed London punk rock acts, [[The Clash]] and [[The Damned]], made their live debuts opening for the Sex Pistols on [[4 July]] and [[6 July]], respectively. On [[3 September]] [[1976]], the Pistols played their first concert outside Britain, at the opening of the Club De Chalet Du Lac in [[Paris]]. Their first major tour of Britain soon followed, lasting from mid-September to early October.

Following a showcase gig at London's first [[100 Club Punk Festival|punk festival]], held in October 1976 at the 100 Club in [[Oxford Street]], the Sex Pistols signed to the major label [[EMI]]. The band's first single, "[[Anarchy in the U.K.]]", released on [[26 November]] [[1976]], served as a statement of intent—full of wit, anger and visceral energy. Despite a common perception that punk bands couldn't play their instruments, contemporary music press reviews and live recordings reveal the Pistols to have been a tight, competent and ferocious live band.<ref name="punk77">{{cite web | author= Don't Care, Peter| year= 1977| title="Club Lafayette, Wolverhampton, UK 21/12/77" | work=Punk77.co.uk| url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/sexpistolsclublaf.htm | accessmonthday= October 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="Coon">Coon, Caroline, "Parade Of The Punks", Melody Maker, October 2 1976</ref><ref name="rstn">{{cite web | author= Young, Charles M| year= 1977| title="Rock Is Sick and Living in London" | work=Rolling Stone| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeatles/articles/story/9437647/sex_pistols_rock_is_sick_and_living_in_london?source=thebeatles_rssfeed | accessmonthday= October 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Their behaviour, as much as their music, brought them national attention. On [[1 December]] [[1976]] the band and members of the Bromley Contingent created a storm of publicity by swearing during an early evening live broadcast of [[Thames Television]]'s ''Today'' programme. Appearing as last-minute replacements for fellow EMI artists [[Queen (band)|Queen]], band and entourage took full advantage of the [[green room]] facilities, and consumed significant amounts of alcohol. During the interview, Rotten used the word "shit", and host [[Bill Grundy]], who was apparently drunk at the time, flirted openly with Siouxsie Sioux: "We'll meet afterwards, shall we?" This prompted the following exchange between the host and Steve Jones:
:Jones: You dirty sod. You dirty old man.
:Grundy: Well keep going chief, keep going. Go on. You've got another five seconds. Say something outrageous.
:Jones: You dirty bastard.
:Grundy: Go on, again.
:Jones: You dirty fucker.
:Grundy: What a clever boy.
:Jones: What a fucking rotter.</blockquote><ref>{{cite book | last = Southall | first = Brian | title = 90 Days At EMI | year = 2007 | publisher = Bobcat Books Ltd., London | pages = p. 52 | id = ISBN 1-84609-779-9}}</ref>

[[Image:Filthandfury.png|thumb|right|''[[Daily Mirror]]'' front page, [[2 December]] [[1976]]]]Although the programme was broadcast only in the London region, the ensuing furore occupied the [[tabloid]] newspapers for days. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' famously ran the headline "The Filth and the Fury", while the ''[[Daily Express]]'' led with "Punk? Call it Filthy Lucre"—phrases Lydon adopted for Pistols projects many years later. Thames Television suspended Grundy, and though he was later reinstated, the interview effectively ended his career.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2002| title="Manchester Celebrities: Bill Grundy" | work=Manchester 2002 | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/broadcasters10.html | accessmonthday= October 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The episode created mass publicity for the band and brought punk into the mainstream. The Pistols set out on the Anarchy Tour of the UK, though many of the concerts were either crowded by hostile press or cancelled by organisers or local authorities.<ref name="savage" /> In a television interview, London councilor Bernard Brook Partridge declared, "Some of these groups would be vastly improved by sudden death ... I would like to see someone dig a huge hole and bury the lot of them in it."<ref name="fatf">{{cite web | author= | year=2002| title="The Sex Pistols ARE punk" | work=The Filth and the Fury Official Website| url=http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/home.htm | accessmonthday= October 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Following the end of the tour in December 1976, EMI arranged a series of concerts for January 1977 at the Paradiso in [[Amsterdam]].<ref name="BBC2">{{cite web | author= Artist Profiles | year=| title=''On This Day'': 1977 - EMI fires Sex Pistols" | work=BBC.co.uk| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/6/newsid_2476000/2476723.stm | accessmonthday= September 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> But before boarding the plane at [[London Heathrow Airport]], the band reportedly spat on each other and verbally abused airport staff. "One witness claimed the Sex Pistols were doing something so disgusting that she could not repeat it for publication ... it became generally believed Jones had been vomiting on old ladies in the preflight lounge," reported ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name="rstn"/> EMI released the band from their contract two days later.<ref name="BBC2" /> "I don't understand it," Rotten remarked at the time. "All we're trying to do is destroy everything."<ref>{{cite web | author= Album Review | year=2004| title="Anarchy in the U.K." | work=Rolling Stone| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595898/anarchy_in_the_uk | accessmonthday= October 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

=== Sid Vicious joins the band ===
The Paradiso gigs would be their last with Matlock, who parted company with the band in February 1977. According to popular legend he was sacked because he "liked [[The Beatles]]",<ref name="BBC1" /> but Steve Jones later claimed the reason was that Matlock didn't "fit in" with the others, stating, obliquely, that Matlock was "always washing his feet".<ref>{{cite web | author= McKenna, Kristine| year=2005| title="Q&A with Steve Jones" | work=Rhino Magazine | url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/StoryKeeper.lasso?StoryID=779| accessmonthday= October 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Matlock now claims to have quit voluntarily, mainly because of an increasingly acrimonious relationship with Rotten.<ref name="coon2"> Coon, Caroline, "1988: The New Wave Punk Rock Explosion", Omnibus Press, 1977. ISBN 0-7119-0051-5</ref> Matlock immediately formed his own band, [[Rich Kids]], with [[Midge Ure]], Rusty Egan and Steve New.

Matlock was replaced by Rotten's friend and self-appointed "ultimate Sex Pistols fan"<ref name="Butt"> Butt, Malcolm, "Sid Vicious - Rock'n'roll Star", Plexus Publishing Ltd, 2003. ISBN 0-85965-340-4</ref> Sid Vicious (John Simon Ritchie), previously drummer of [[Siouxsie & the Banshees]] and [[The Flowers of Romance (band)|The Flowers of Romance]]. McLaren approved Vicious as a member on account of his look and "punk attitude", despite his limited musical abilities.<ref name="mlock" /> McLaren later stated that, much earlier in the band's career, Vivienne Westood had told him he should "get the guy called John who came to the store a couple of times" to be the singer. When Johnny Rotten was recruited for the band, Westwood said McLaren had got it wrong, "he had got the wrong John." It was John Ritchie—the future Vicious—she had been recommending.<ref name="Blood">Crabtree, Steve "[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426340/combined Blood on the Turntable: The Sex Pistols]", [[BBC]] documentary (2004).</ref>

According to McLaren, "When Sid joined he couldn't play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band. He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist."<ref name="popmatters">{{cite web | author=Robinson, Charlotte | year=2006| title="So Tough: The Boy Behind the Sid Vicious Myth"| work=PopMatters| url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/features/060809-sidvicious.shtml | accessmonthday= October 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Lydon later recalled, "The first rehearsals with Sid were hellish. Everyone agreed he had the look. Sid tried real hard ... but boy, he couldn't play bass."<ref name="jlydon" /> Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie & the Banshees, has said, "After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story..."<ref name="popmatters"/> Vicious's amplifier was often turned down, or off, during live performances,<ref> Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming: The Sex Pistols and Punk Rock'', Faber and Faber, 1991</ref> and most of the bass parts on the band's later recordings were played by either Jones or Matlock.<ref name="jlydon" /> 

Membership in the Sex Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious. As Rotten observed, "Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly he was a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid."<ref name="popmatters"/> Vicious responded by actively cultivating a notorious persona. Early in 1977, he met [[Nancy Spungen]], a drug addict and occasional prostitute<ref name="nndb">{{cite web | author= | year= | title="Sid Vicious"| work=nndb.com | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/671/000031578/ | accessmonthday= October 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> from [[New York]] with a history of severe emotional problems.<ref name="popmatters"/> Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional co-dependency between the couple alienated Vicious from the other members of the band. Rotten said, "We did everything to get rid of Nancy. She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission. Only she didn't want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her. She was so utterly fucked up and evil."<ref name="jlydon"/> Sid Vicious debuted with the band at the Screen on the Green in London on [[3 April]] [[1977]].

On [[10 March]] [[1977]], at a press ceremony held outside [[Buckingham Palace]], the Sex Pistols signed to [[A&M Records]]. They returned to the A&M offices for what would become an unruly party. Sid Vicious trashed the managing director's office and vomited on his desk. Under pressure from its own employees, artists and distributors, A&M broke contract with the Pistols six days later.<ref name="rstn"/> In May the band signed their third and final record deal with [[Virgin Records]].<ref name="thesexpistol"/>

The Pistols' second single, "God Save the Queen", was released on [[27 May]] [[1977]]. Though widely perceived as a personal attack on [[Queen Elizabeth II]],<ref name="savage" /> Rotten later stated that the song was not aimed at her specifically, but was instead intended to critique the deference given to royalty in general. However, the perceived disrespect to the monarchy caused widespread public outcry. The record was banned from airplay by the [[BBC]], whose [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] dominated music broadcasting. Rotten later remarked, "We had declared war on the entire country—without meaning to!"<ref name="jlydon" /> 

During the week of Queen Elizabeth's [[Silver Jubilee]], the single reached number one in the ''NME'' chart, but only number two in the official UK chart.<ref name "nat"/> Many suspected that the data had been massaged, believing that the record had actually qualified for the top spot, but that the charts had been rigged to prevent a spectacle.<ref>{{cite web | author= Petridis, Alexis | year= 2002| title="Leaders of the Banned" | work=Guardian Unlimited (UK) | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,735307,00.html | accessmonthday= September 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="Urban">{{cite web | author= Number 1s Index | year=| title="Quirks Of The Number One Position" | work=everyHit.com | url=http://www.everyhit.com/number1quirks.html | accessmonthday= September 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> At least one radio station announced the song at number one, but refused to play it, as they had been advised it might incite disruptions of the national celebration.<ref>{{cite web | author= Petridis, Alexis | year= 2002| title="Leaders of the Banned" | work=Guardian Unlimited (UK) | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,735307,00.html | accessmonthday= September 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= | year= 2001| title="Sex Pistols may play jubilee gig" | work=BBC.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1718918.stm | accessmonthday= October 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The Pistols marked the Jubilee, and the success of their record, by chartering a private boat, intending to perform live while sailing down the [[River Thames]], passing [[Westminster]] and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The event ended in chaos, however, when the boat was raided by police, despite a license to perform having been granted. McLaren, the band and many of their entourage were taken into custody when the vessel docked.<ref>{{cite web | author=Street-Porter, Janet | year= 2002| title="Jubilee!"| work=The Independent (UK) | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020526/ai_n12618123 | accessmonthday= October 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Violent attacks on punk fans were on the rise; on [[18 June]] Rotten himself was assaulted by a knife-wielding gang outside [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]]'s Pegasus pub, causing tendon damage to his arm.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title="Sex Pistols Diary: 1977" | work=rockmine.com | url=http://www.rockmine.com/Pistols/SexDate2.html | accessmonthday= September 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> A tour of Scandinavia, planned to start at the end of the month, was consequently delayed until mid-July.

''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]]'' was recorded between March and June 1977, in Wessex Studios, [[Highbury]], London,<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title="Wessex Studios: Highbury" | work= derelictlondon.com | url=http://www.derelictlondon.com/id14.htm | accessmonthday= October 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and produced by [[Chris Thomas]], who had worked with [[Roxy Music]]. Due to Vicious's lack of musical ability, the bass parts on ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' were performed by Steve Jones. According to Jones, "Sid wanted to come down and play on the album, and we tried as hard as possible not to let him anywhere near the studio. Luckily he had hepatitis at the time."<ref name="jlydon"/> Although Vicious did record on one occasion, his contribution was later over-dubbed. Jones recalls, "We just let him do it, innit. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low. I think it might be barely audible on the track."<ref name="jlydon"/>

''Never Mind the Bollocks'' was released on [[28 October]] [[1977]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Savage | first = Jon | title = England's Dreaming | year = 1991 | publisher = [[Faber|Faber & Faber]], London | pages = p. 414 | id = ISBN 0-571-22720-1}}</ref> to mixed reviews. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised the album, comparing its sound to "two subway trains crashing together under 4 feet of mud, victims screaming", and applauded the band for playing "with an energy and conviction that is positively transcendent in its madness and fever".<ref>Nelson, Paul, 1977, "When the father-house burns...", ''Rolling Stone'', issue 259</ref>  Some critics, however, were disappointed that the album contained versions of all four previously released singles, and considered the release to be effectively a "Greatest Hits" album.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= 2004 | title="When the father-house burns..." | work=pitchforkmedia.com

The album title caused difficulties for the band. [[Boots The Chemists|Boots]], [[W.H. Smith]] and [[Woolworths Group|Woolworth's]] refused to stock the album, a Conservative [[Member of Parliament|MP]] condemned it as "a symptom of the way society is declining" and the Independent Television Companies Association refused to carry its TV advertising campaign.<ref>Collins, Andrew, 1998, "Never Mind the Bollocks", ''Q'' Magazine</ref> In [[Nottingham]] a record outlet was threatened with prosecution for displaying "indecent printed matter". The case was overturned when defending [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] [[John Mortimer]] produced expert witnesses who were able to demonstrate that the word ''[[bollocks]]'' was an [[Old English language|Old English]] term for a [[priest]].<ref>Charlesworth, Simon J., "A Phenomenology of Working Class Experience" Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref> Although the word in popular slang means [[testicle]]s, in the context of the Pistols' album title it is primarily intended to signify "nonsense". Steve Jones had suggested the title—he claimed unwittingly—inspired by two friends who owned a hot dog stand. According to his account, they would routinely interrupt him mid-sentence, exclaiming "Oh, never mind the bollocks".<ref name="jlydon"/> 

The Sex Pistols' final UK performance took place at Ivanhoe's in [[Huddersfield]], on Christmas Day 1977. The band played a matinee and evening show as part of a benefit for the families of striking firemen. The location of the gigs was not announced until shortly before the venue opened, a tactic the band was then employing regularly to avoid the sort of attention that had led to earlier cancellations.

=== U.S. tour and the end of the band ===
In January 1978 the Sex Pistols embarked on a US tour, consisting mainly of dates in America's [[Deep South]]. Originally scheduled for December 1977, it was delayed due to American authorities' reluctance to issue visas to band members with criminal records.<ref name="ffbio2">{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title="Sex Pistols Biography"| work=The Filth and the Fury Official Website| url=http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/pistols/bio/sp_bio2.htm | accessmonthday= October 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Though highly anticipated by fans and media, the tour was plagued by in-fighting, poor planning and physically belligerent audiences.<ref name="ffbio2"/><ref name="crock">{{cite web | author= White, David| year= | title="Sex Pistols"| work=About.com: Classic Rock| url=http://classicrock.about.com/od/artistprofilesrz/p/sex_pistols.htm | accessmonthday= October 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> McLaren has admitted that he purposely booked [[redneck]] bars to provoke hostile situations.<ref name="Blood">Crabtree, Steve "[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426340/combined Blood on the Turntable: The Sex Pistols]", [[BBC]] documentary (2004).</ref> Over the course of the two weeks, Vicious, by now heavily addicted to heroin,<ref name="Huey">{{cite web | author=Huey, Steve | year=2005| title="Sid Vicious: Biography"| work=VHI.com| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/vicious_sid/bio.jhtml | accessmonthday= October 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> 
began to live up to his stage name. According to Rotten, "He finally had an audience of people who would behave with shock and horror. Sid was easily led by the nose."<ref name="jlydon"/> 

Early in the tour, Vicious wandered off from his [[Holiday Inn]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], looking for drugs. He was found in a hospital, having carved the words "Gimme a fix" in his chest with a razor. During a concert in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Vicious called the crowd "a bunch of faggots", before striking an audience member across the head with his bass guitar.<ref name="Huey"/> In [[Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]], he received simulated oral sex on stage, later declaring "that’s the kind of girl I like".<ref name="Klein">Klein, Howie, "Sex Pistols: Tour Notes", New York Rocker, February 1978</ref> Suffering from heroin withdrawal during a show in [[Dallas]], Texas, he spat blood at a woman who had climbed onstage and punched him in the face.<ref name="jlydon"/> He was admitted to hospital later that night to treat various injuries.

Rotten, meanwhile, suffering from flu<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title="Sex Pistols Biography pt3"| work=The Filth and the Fury Official Website| url=http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/pistols/bio/sp_bio3.htm| accessmonthday= October 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and coughing up blood, felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones,<ref name="jlydon"/> and disgusted by Vicious.<ref name="Robb"/> On [[14 January]] [[1978]], during the tour's final date at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, "You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard." That one number was a [[The Stooges|Stooges]] cover, "No Fun". In the closing lines, sneering at the audience, Rotten declared, "This is no fun, at all."<ref name="jlydon"/><ref name="Robb"/> After the performance Rotten addressed the audience directly—"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage.<ref name="Cooper"> Cooper, Mark, "The Sex Pistols: Winterland, San Francisco", Record Mirror, January 28th, 1978</ref> He later observed, "I hated the whole scenario. It was a farce. I felt cheated. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. Malcolm wouldn't speak to me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn't agree to anything. It was all very bitter and confusing."<ref name="Robb"/>

On [[17 January]] [[1978]], Rotten announced his departure from the Sex Pistols.<ref name="savage"/> Vicious departed for New York, while McLaren, Cook and Jones took off for a working vacation in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Rotten found himself without money or a means of getting home. He later described the situation: "The Sex Pistols left me, stranded in [[Los Angeles]] with no ticket, no hotel room, and a message to Warner Bros saying that if anyone phones up claiming to be Johnny Rotten, then they were lying. That's how I finished with Malcolm—but not with the rest of the band; I'll always like them."<ref>{{cite web | author= Das, Lina| year=2006| title="Jolly Rotten"| work=Daily Mail, Weekend Magazine| url=http://www.johnlydon.com/mail06.html | accessmonthday= October 4 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He eventually telephoned the head of Virgin Records, [[Richard Branson]], who agreed to pay for his flight back to London, via [[Jamaica]]. In Jamaica, Branson met with members of the band [[Devo]], and tried to install Rotten as their lead singer. Devo declined the offer. 

The Sex Pistols continued, briefly, with Cook, Jones and Vicious. Attempts were made at finding a new frontman, but the band ended up with all three members taking lead vocal turns alongside guest vocalists. The group did not perform live in the post-Rotten period, but the majority of the recordings from this time were later released.

=== Post-breakup ===
After leaving the Pistols, Johnny Rotten reverted to his birth name of Lydon, and formed [[Public Image Ltd]] with former Clash member [[Keith Levene]] and school friend [[Jah Wobble]].<ref>{{cite web | author= Ruhlmann, William | year=2005| title="Public Image Ltd." | work=allmusic.com | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:omzyxdyb8ol0~T1 | accessmonthday= October 12 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The band went on to score a UK Top Ten hit with their debut single, 1978's "Public Image".

Vicious relocated to New York, and with Nancy Spungen acting as his manager, began to perform as a solo artist. He recorded a live album, 1979's ''[[Sid Sings]]'', backed by "The Idols" featuring [[Arthur Kane]] and [[Jerry Nolan]] of the New York Dolls. On [[12 October]] [[1978]] Spungen was found dead in the [[Chelsea Hotel]] room she was sharing with Vicious, with stab wounds to her stomach and dressed only in her underwear.<ref name="bbcSV">{{cite web | author= | year=1978| title="Sex Pistol Vicious on murder charge " | work=BBC.co.uk| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/12/newsid_2543000/2543439.stm | accessmonthday= October 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Police recovered drug paraphernalia from the scene and Vicious was arrested and charged with her murder. In an interview at the time, McLaren said, "I can't believe he was involved in such a thing. Sid was set to marry Nancy in New York. He was very close to her and had quite a passionate affair with her."<ref name="bbcSV"/> Vicious died five months later, on [[2 February]] [[1979]], of a heroin overdose after a party held to celebrate his release on bail.<ref name="Silverton">Silverton, Peter, "Sid Vicious's mum", The Observer (UK), 1996</ref> He was only 21.

McLaren had wanted for some time to make a film featuring the Sex Pistols. In 1977 he hired [[Russ Meyer]] to direct a script, ''[[Who Killed Bambi?]]'', he had written with [[Roger Ebert]]. After only a day-and-a-half's shooting production ceased when members of the crew, in protest over unpaid monies owed by McLaren, walked off the set.<ref>{{cite web | author= Lilith eZine| year=2005 | title="Meyer: The Father of Softcore Erotica"| work= Lilith Gallery of Toronto| url=http://www.lilithgallery.com/articles/2005/russmeyer_biography.html | accessmonthday= September 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> A second attempt was made in mid-1978, with Cook and Jones starring in the McLaren-scripted ''[[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle]]''.

Issue: 3., May-June 2005</ref> The soundtrack featured Jones, occasionally Cook or Vicious, and sometimes [[Edward Tudor-Pole]], trading on their vocals and engaging in McLaren-concocted gimmicks, such as recording two songs on the album with notorious British criminal [[Ronnie Biggs]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2005| title="Sex Pistols 'Swindle' Again" | work=Billboard magazine| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000929906 | accessmonthday= September 9 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Cook and Jones continued to work through guest appearances<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title="STEVE JONES "Boys will be boys"" | work=cookandjones.co.uk | url=http://www.cookandjones.co.uk/professionals_postscript.htm | accessmonthday= October 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and as [[session musician]]s, and later formed [[The Professionals (band)|The Professionals]].

After playing with the band Chiefs of Relief, Cook currently plays in [[Man-Raze]]. Matlock has been involved in various bands, including [[The Rich Kids]] (with Midge Ure) in 1978 and The Philistines since 2000, and has released several solo albums. McLaren went on to manage [[Adam & the Ants]] and [[Bow Wow Wow]], and in the mid-1980s released a number of hit records as a solo artist.<ref>{{cite web | author= All Media Guide | year=2005| title="Malcolm McLaren" | work=VHI.com| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/mclaren_malcolm/bio.jhtml | accessmonthday= October 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

After a bitter, drawn-out legal case, in January 1986 the four surviving members of the Sex Pistols as well as the estate of Sid Vicious were awarded control of the band's heritage, including publishing rights, master recordings, film footage and exclusive rights to the name "Sex Pistols".<ref> Verrico, Lisa, "Interview with John Lydon", The Times (UK), March 1999</ref> This access enabled the production of the 2000 Julien Temple documentary ''[[The Filth and the Fury]]'', formulated as an attempt to tell the story from the band's point of view, in contrast to the McLaren-oriented ''Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle''.<ref>{{cite web | author= Swietek, Frank | year=2000| title="The Filth and the Fury" | work=oneguysopinion.com| url=http://www.oneguysopinion.com/Review.php?ID=134 | accessmonthday= October 18 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On [[9 March]] [[2006]] the band sold the rights to their back catalogue to [[Universal Music Group]]. The sale was criticized as a "sell out".<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title="Sex Pistols sell out" | work=theage.com.au | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/sex-pistols-sell-out/2006/03/10/1141701665565.html | accessmonthday=September 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

=== Reunions ===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:The Sex Pistols MEN.jpg|thumb||left|The Sex Pistols on their 30th anniversary tour (MEN Arena, Manchester]] -->
The original four, surviving members of the Sex Pistols reformed in 1996 for the six-month [[Filthy Lucre Tour]], which included dates in Europe, North and South America, Australia and Japan,<ref name="thesexpistol"/> as well as appearances at the [[Phoenix Festival]]. In 2002—the year of the Queen's [[Golden Jubilee]]—they played the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre]] in London. In 2003 they toured North America for three weeks as part of their Piss Off Tour.

In November 2005, the Sex Pistols were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, an honour that the band members turned down, with an "obscene gesture" and a suggestion that the Hall of Fame "kiss this".<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title="Sex Pistol to Rock Hall: 'Kiss this!' | work=CNN.com | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/13/leisure.rotten.reut/ | accessmonthday=September 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> According to Jones, "Once you want to be put into a museum, Rock & Roll's over; it's not voted by fans, it's voted by people who induct you, or others; people who are already in it."<ref>{{cite web | author= Brand, Madeleine | year=2006| title="Sex Pistols' Steve Jones, Just Saying No" | work=.npr.org | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5259850 | accessmonthday=October 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

They reunited for five gigs at [[Brixton Academy]] in November 2007 and have remained active since.

== Influence and cultural legacy ==
The Sex Pistols are remembered for arousing the passions of their audience beyond the immediate impact of their music. According to Lydon, "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time."<ref name="plastic"/> Whether the Pistols' anti-establishment stance was spontaneous or cultivated has been debated. Critic Bill Wyman argues that "England's depressed social psyche at the time" made the emergence of a band like the Pistols rather likely. Wyman acknowledges that Rotten's "fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma" were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's real meaning lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations.<ref>Wyman, Bill. [http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2000/04/28/pistols/index.html The Revenge of the Sex Pistols], ''Salon'', April 2000</ref> While many of the Sex Pistols' outrages were plotted, the most famous was evidently not.

The day after the Sex Pistols' infamous appearance on the Bill Grundy ''Today'' show, their story appeared on the front page of every national newspaper in Great Britain. ''Rolling Stone'' suggested the band, responding "to the star trappings and complacency" of mid-1970s rock, "came to spark and personify one of the few truly critical moments in pop culture—the rise of punk."<ref name="thesexpistol"/> While they were not the first punk band, the Pistols' ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' is a singular achievement within the punk movement and an important event in the history of popular music in general. It is regularly cited on lists of the greatest albums ever: In 2006 the album was voted #27 in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine's "100 Greatest Albums Ever",<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title="2006 Q Magazine — 100 Greatest Albums Ever" | work=ALLOFMP3| url=http://music.allofmp3.com/awards/awards_q100.shtml | accessmonthday= October 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> while ''Rolling Stone'' listed it at #2 in its 1987 "Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years".<ref>[http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/A391.htm/ Rolling Stone Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years], ''Rolling Stone'', November 1987</ref>  In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked The Sex Pistols #58 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Immortals: The First Fifty| work = Rolling Stone Issue 946| publisher = Rolling Stone| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = The Sex Pistols| work = Billie Joe Armstrong.

The Sex Pistols directly inspired the style, and often the formation itself, of many punk and post-punk bands during their brief existence. [[The Clash]]<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title="The Clash were classic punk" | work=punk77.co.uk| url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/clash.htm | accessmonthday= October 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and Siouxsie & The Banshees<ref>{{cite web | author= Ankeny, Jason| year= 2005 | title="Siouxsie & The Banshees" | work=Verve Forecast| url=http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/artist.aspx?ob=per&src=prd&aid=7114 | accessmonthday= October 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> are among those in London's "inner circle" of early punk bands that credit the Pistols. On [[4 June]] [[1976]], still early in their career, the Sex Pistols performed to a crowd of around 40 people at the [[Free Trade Hall|Lesser Free Trade Hall]] in Manchester. It was to become one of the most important and mythologized events in rock history. Among the audience were many who would later form bands or otherwise popularise the embryonic punk movement, including [[Pete Shelley]] and [[Howard Devoto]], who organised the gig and would soon found the [[Buzzcocks]]; [[Bernard Sumner]], [[Ian Curtis]] and [[Peter Hook]], later of [[Joy Division]]; [[Mark E. Smith]], later of [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]; [[Morrissey]], later of [[The Smiths]]; and [[Anthony H.
