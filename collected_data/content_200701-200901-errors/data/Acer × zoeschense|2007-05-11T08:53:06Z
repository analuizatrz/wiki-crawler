'''''Acer zoeschense''''', a variety of [[maple]], is a [[hybrid]] of the [[Hedge Maple]] (''A. campestre'') and the [[Cappadocian Maple]] (''A. cappadocicum'').  It takes its name from ZÃ¶schen Nurseries, [[Germany]] where it first appeared as a garden hybrid (as opposed to a hybrid occurring in nature or one deliberately engineered by humans).<ref name="gelderen">van Gelderen, C.J. & van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.</ref>

==Description==
''A. zoeschense'' is a large [[tree]] that reaches a height of up to 20&nbsp;m (66&nbsp;feet) or more and is almost as wide.  The shiny, five-lobed leaves are dark green in colour with purplish edges.  The [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] produce a milky [[sap]] when broken.  It flowers in [[umbel|umbels]], but as a [[infertility|sterile]] hybrid, it produces neither [[fruit]] nor [[seed|seeds]].<ref name="gelderen"/>

==Cultivation==
One [[cultivar]] of this tree, ''A. zoeschense'' 'Annae', was popular as a street tree in previous generations.  In the [[United Kingdom]], a mature and magnificent example of  'Annae' can be viewed in [[Westonbirt Arboretum]].  The [[Japan|Japanese]] cultivar, 'Kinka', has [[variegation|variegated]] foliage.<ref name="gelderen"/>
