Tulsa was first settled in the 1830s by the [[Creek people|Creek]] [[Native American]] tribe after the [[Trail of Tears|forced removal]] of the [[five civilized tribes]] into [[Indian Territory]] and what would later become the state of Oklahoma.

[[Image:Meadowgold.jpg|thumb|left|The Meadow Gold sign greeted Route 66 travelers in Tulsa for decades.]]
What was to ultimately become Tulsa was originally part of [[Indian Territory]] and was first settled by the Lochapoka and Creek tribes in 1836.<ref name="Tulsa Area History">{{cite web | url= http://www.tulsalibrary.org/tulsahistory/communities.htm#tul| title= Tulsa Area History |publisher= Tulsa County Library| accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> They established a home under a large oak tree at the present day intersection of Cheyenne Avenue and 18th Street, and named their new settlement "Tallasi," meaning "old town" in the Creek language, which later became "Tulsa."<ref name="Tulsa Area History"/> On [[January 18]] [[1898]], Tulsa was officially incorporated and elected its first mayor, Edward Calkins.<ref name="Tulsa County History">{{cite web | first=Jeff | last=Smith | date= [[2005-09-15]] | url= http://www.rootsweb.com/~oktulsa/history.htm| title= Tulsa County History |publisher= Roots Web| accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> 

Tulsa was a small town near the banks of the [[Arkansas River]] in 1901. Its first oil well, named Sue Bland No. 1,<ref name="Tulsa County History"/> was established that year. By 1905, the discovery of a large oil pool near the town of [[Glenpool, Oklahoma|Glenpool]] had prompted thousands of businessmen to seek claims to some of the area's growing number of oil fields. The town's 1900 population was estimated at 1,390, but by 1930, the number had swelled to over 140,000.<ref name="Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990">{{cite web | date=June 1998 | url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html | title= Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990| first=Campbell | last=Gibson| accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> An immense economic surge from the burgeoning oil industry earned the city the nickname "Oil Capital of the World" for most of the 20th century.<ref name="Tulsa History" /> With the success of oil barons and their patrons, an increase in the construction of skyscrapers and residential estates in the popular [[Art Deco]] style of the time occurred as newly acquired fortunes were used to aid the efforts. Profits from the oil industry continued well into the [[Great Depression]], helping the city's economy fare much better than most cities in the United States during the 1930s.<ref name="Art Deco in Tulsa">{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsalibrary.org/research/artdeco/artdecointulsa.htm| title= What's Doing in Tulsa?| first=Rex | last=Ball | coauthors=Jennifer Young| publisher= Tulsa City-County Library | accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> When residential growth prompted the need for a much larger infrastructure network, work began on costructing a dam to aid the water needs of the rapidly growing city, and bridges over the Arkansas River were built to meet its transportation needs. The Spavinaw Dam, located 65 miles from the city, was considered one of the largest public works projects of the era.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsaweb.com/tulhist.htm| title=Tulsa's History | publisher= Tulsa Web | accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref> 
[[Image:Cains Ballroom Tulsa.jpg|thumb|right|Cain's Ballroom came to be known as the "Carnegie Hall of Western Swing"<ref name="Cain's Ballroom" /> in the early 20th century.]]
In the 1910s and 20s, Tulsa was home to a large "[[Black Wall Street]]," one of the most prosperous [[African American]] communities in the United States at the time.<ref name="Tulsa Race Riot" /> Located in the [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood]] neighborhood of North Tulsa, it was the site of the a large [[race riot]] in 1921. Dick Rowland, a black man, was accused of assaulting a white woman in an elevator in downtown Tulsa. While being held at the Tulsa County Courthouse, a mob of angry white protesters and groups of black residents from the Greenwood District began gathering outside the courthouse. Bolstered by an inflammatory article published in the Tulsa Tribune, fighting between the groups broke out. Known as the [[Tulsa Race Riot]], the violence that spread into the Greenwood district was one of the nation's worst acts of racial violence and large-scale civil disorder.<ref name="Tulsa Race Riot" /> From [[May 31]] to [[June 1]], [[1921]], in 16 hours of rioting, over 800 people were admitted to local hospitals with injuries, an estimated 10,000 were left homeless, 35 city blocks composed of 1,256 residences were destroyed by fire, and $1.8 million was caused in property damage.<ref name="Tulsa Race Riot" /> Nearly 40 people were officially reported killed, but estimates suggest as many as 300, mostly blacks, died.<ref name="Tulsa Race Riot" /> Confined mainly to the segregated Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa, the riot was responsible for wiping out much the prosperity and success that Black Wall Street had achieved.  The area was partially rebuilt and continued to be an active community after the riot, but its character was ultimately changed and lost after the period of integration and subsequent "urban renewal" inititives.

For the remainder of the mid-20th century, oil profits and an increasing aviation industry propelled the city to another economic surge. The new prosperity led to the development of a master plan, which called for the construction of numerous parks, churches, museums, rose gardens, improved infrastructure, and increased national advertising. Following [[World War II]], Tulsa became an important base for the airline industry. In the 1950s, Time magazine dubbed Tulsa "America's Most Beautiful City."<ref name="Tulsa History" />

The efforts of Tulsa businessman [[Cyrus Avery]], known the "Father of Route 66,"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/carney/avery.html | title=The Father of Route 66 | publisher=[[University of Virginia]] | accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> further aided 20th century growth. Avery began his campaign to create a road linking [[Chicago]] to [[California]] by establishing the [[U.S. Highway 66 Association]] in Tulsa in 1927, earning the city the nickname "Birthplace of Route 66."<ref name="Route 66" /> Once completed, [[Route 66]] took an important role in Tulsa's development as the city served as a popular rest stop for travelers, who were greeted by area Route 66 icons such as the Meadow Gold Sign and the [[Catoosa Blue Whale|Blue Whale]]. During this period, [[Bob Wills]] and his group [[The Texas Playboys]] began their long performing stint at a small ballroom in downtown Tulsa. In 1935, [[Cain's Ballroom]] became the base for the group,<ref name="Cain's Ballroom" /> which is largely credited for creating [[Western Swing]] music. As a result, Cain's Ballroom became a hub for the new kind of music. The venue continued to attract famous musicians through its history, and is still in operation today.<ref name="Cain's Ballroom" />
[[Image:BOK Center Construction May07 TulsaOK.jpg|thumb|left|The centerpiece of the Vision 2025 projects, the BOK Center, began construction in 2005.]]

In 1982, a national recession greatly affected Tulsa's economy, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma heavily dependent on oil witnessed freefall in gas prices and a mass exodus of oil industries. By 1987, national natural gas prices had dropped over 32% while crude oil prices had plummeted 46%.<ref name="Oil Bust">{{cite web | date=[[2006-01-23]] | url= http://staging.okcommerce.gov/test1/dmdocuments/Oklahoma_Oil_Gas_Briefing_January_2006_0302061746.pdf| title= Oil and Gas Briefing| format=PDF | publisher= Oklahoma Department of Commerce | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, was one of the hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices.<ref name="Oil Bust" /> By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered,<ref name="Oil Bust" /> but leaders would attempt to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.

Following the recession, the city's dominance in the oil industry was relinquished, and Tulsa leaders worked to diversify the local economy. Efforts led to the passage of the "[[Vision 2025]]" program in 2003 with the purpose of enhancing and revitalizing Tulsa's infrastructure and tourism industry. The keystone project of Vision 2025 was the construction of the [[BOK Center]] in downtown Tulsa. The multi-purpose arena, designed by famed architect [[Cesar Pelli]], is intended to be a home for the city's minor league hockey and arena football teams, as well as a venue for major concerts and conventions. Groundbreaking on the structure occurred in 2005 and completion is expected in 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://ww3.visittulsa.com/general.asp?id=207| title= BOK Center| publisher= Tulsa Convention and Visitors Bureau | accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref>

==Law and government==
{{main|Government of Tulsa, Oklahoma}}

[[Image:Tulsa City Hall 2.JPG|thumb|right|The Tulsa City Hall serves as the base for most city government functions.]]
A [[mayor-council government]] has been in place in Tulsa since 1989 when the city converted from a [[city commission government]] deemed wasteful and less efficient.<ref name="About the Tulsa City Council">{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsacouncil.org/about_cc.php | title=About the Tulsa City Council | publisher=The Tulsa City Council| accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been given more power in accordance with a [[mayor-council government#Executive or Strong Mayor Form|strong mayoral system]] and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches.<ref name="About the Tulsa City Council" /> [[Plurality voting system|Plurality voting]] is used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is [[Kathy Taylor|Kathryn Taylor]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], who previously served as Secretary of Commerce and Tourism for the state of Oklahoma. Taylor unseated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bill LaFortune|William LaFortune]] in his reelection campaign of April 2006. A notable Tulsa political figure, [[Jim Inhofe]], who represents Oklahoma in the [[United States Senate]], is a strong critic of the alleged severity of [[global warming]]<ref>{{cite news | date=[[2007-02-07]] | url=http://www.urbantulsa.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A15840| title= On the Right Side? | first=David | last=Austin | publisher= Urban Tulsa Weekly | accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> and served as the mayor of Tulsa early in his political career.<ref>{{cite news | date=[[2007-05-04]] | url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/common/printerfriendlystory.aspx?articleID=070428_238_A1_hVPma51656| title= Vice President Visits Tulsa: Cheney, Inhofe blast Democrats' plan for Iraq | first=Randy | last=Krehbiel | publisher= Tulsa World | accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref>

A city councilor from each of the city's nine council districts is elected every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective districts based on a [[plurality voting system]], and serve on the Tulsa City Council. Roscoe Turner of District Three currently serves as the council chairman along with Vice Chairman John Eagleton of District Seven. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of city government, which aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in city government. In accordance with the mayor-council form of government, the Tulsa City Council and the office of the Mayor coordinate in city government operations. A third body of the government, the city auditor, is elected independently of the city council and mayor to ensure that the auditor can act in an objective manner. This position serves a term of two years, and the current city auditor is Phil Wood, a Democrat.

Municipal and State laws are enforced in Tulsa by the Tulsa Police Department, an organization of about 770 officers as of 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vachiefs.org/vacp/jobs/vacp_job_Tulsa.html | title=Police Chief – Tulsa, OK| publisher=Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police| accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> In 2004, Tulsa's crime rate was 7806.1 per 100,000 people, about 1.5 times the national average.<ref name="Crime stats">{{cite web | url=http://tulsa.areaconnect.com/crime1.htm| title=Tulsa OK Crime Statistics (2005 Crime Data) | publisher=Tulsa Area Connect| accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> There were 58 murders, 1096 robberies, and 6,592 burglaries in 2004.<ref name="Crime stats" /> The city serves as the [[county seat|seat of county government]] for Tulsa County, and lies mostly within [[Oklahoma's 1st congressional district]], with its far northwestern areas in southern Osage County in [[Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district]].

===Sister cities===

In accordance with [[Sister Cities International]], an organization that began under President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in 1956, Tulsa has been given eight international [[town twinning|sister cities]] in an attempt to foster cross-cultural understanding:

==Geography==

[[Image:Tulsa skyline.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The Tulsa skyline as viewed from Turkey Mountain.]]
Tulsa is located in the northeastern corner of [[Oklahoma]], situated between the edge of the [[Great Plains]] and the foot of the [[Ozark Mountains]] in a generally forested region of rolling hills. The city touches the eastern extent of the [[Cross Timbers]], an [[ecoregion]] of forest and [[prairie]] transitioning from the drier plains of the west to the wetter forests of the east.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.uark.edu/misc/xtimber/summary.html | publisher=[[University of Arkansas]]| title=The Ancient Cross Timbers| accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> With a wetter climate than points westward, Tulsa serves as a gateway to "[[Green Country]]," a popular and official designation for northeast Oklahoma that stems from the region's green vegetation and relatively high amount of hills and lakes compared to central and western areas of Oklahoma,<ref>{{cite news | first=Leah | last=Clapman | title=Key Races: Oklahoma Senate | date=[[2004-09-24]] | publisher=PBS | url =http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/key-races/ok_profile.html | accessdate = 2007-04-30 }}</ref> which lie largely in the drier Great Plains region of the Central United States. Northeastern Oklahoma is the most topographically diverse part of the state, containing seven of Oklahoma's 11 ecoregions<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.travelok.com/atv/index.asp#map | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism | title=Oklahoma, The All-Terrain Vacation | accessdate=2007-04-20 }}</ref> and more than half of its state parks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.travelok.com/cities/regions.asp?region=G42.G4084 | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism | title=Northeast Oklahoma's Green Country | accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> The region encompasses 30 lakes or reservoirs<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.greencountryok.com/browse.php?type=6| publisher=Green Country Marketing Association | title=Northeast Oklahoma Lakes | accessdate=2007-04-30 }}</ref> and borders the neighboring states of [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]. The [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] of the city of Tulsa are {{coor dms|36|7|53|N|95|56|14|W|city}} (36.131294, -95.937332){{GR|1}}, with an elevation of 213&nbsp;meters (700&nbsp;ft) above [[sea level]].
[[Image:Tulsa satellite poster.jpg|thumb|right|As seen from space, most of Tulsa lies east of the Arkansas River.]]

===Topography===

The city is split by the prominent [[Arkansas River]], which flows in a wide, sandy-bottomed channel. Its flow through the Tulsa area is controlled by upstream [[Keystone Lake|flood control reservoirs]], but its width and depth can vary widely throughout the year, such as during periods of high rainfall or severe drought. However, a low-water dam maintains a full channel at all times in the area adjacent to downtown Tulsa.<ref>{{cite news | first=Gretchen | last=Collins | title=River Parks Proves Practical Need for Visionary Ideas | publisher=Urban Tulsa Weekly | url =http://archives.urbantulsa.com/article.asp?id=11 | accessdate = 2007-04-30 }}</ref> Heavily wooded and with abundant parks and water areas, the city holds several prominent hills with names such as "Shadow Mountain" and "Turkey Mountain," which create varied terrain within the city itself, especially in its southern portions. While the city's central and northern sections are generally flat to gently undulating, the Osage Hills extension into the northwestern part of the city further varies the landscape. Holmes Peak, the future site of [[The American]] monument in the northwest corner of the city, is the tallest point in five counties at 1030&nbsp;ft (314&nbsp;m).<ref>{{cite web | url= http://theamerican.com/location/index.cfm| publisher=The American Project| title=Holmes Peak| accessdate=2007-04-29 }}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 483.9&nbsp;[[square kilometers]] (186.8&nbsp;[[square mile|mi²]]). 473.1 square kilometers&nbsp;(182.6&nbsp;mi²) of it is land and 10.9&nbsp;square kilometers (4.2&nbsp;mi²) of it (2.24%) is water.

===Climate===

[[Image:Philtower in Tulsa.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Philtower]], built in the art deco style, is now surrounded by contemporary office buildings.]]
A building boom in the early 20th century gave Tulsa one of the largest concentrations of [[art deco]] architecture in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsadowntown.org/index.cfm?pageID=13&pageParentIDNew=1| title= Tulsa Historical Background | publisher=Downtown Tulsa Unlimited | accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> Most commonly in the zigzag and [[Streamline Moderne|streamline]] styles,<ref name="Art Deco in Tulsa"/> the city's art deco is dotted throughout its older neighborhoods, primarily in downtown and midtown.

[[Image:BostonAvenueMethodist.jpg|thumb|left|Located in Downtown, the [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]] is one of the city's most prominent examples of [[art deco]] architecture.]]
Downtown Tulsa is an area of approximately 1.4 square miles surrounded by an inner-dispersal loop created by Interstate 244, Highway 64, and Highway 75.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsadowntown.org/index.cfm?pageID=7&pageParentIDNew=1| title= Quick Facts | publisher=Downtown Tulsa Unlimited | accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> The area serves as Tulsa's financial and business district, and is the topic of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture.<ref name="Land Legacy">{{cite web | date=[[2005-12-25]] | url=http://www.landlegacy.com/index.asp?page=news&issue=20051225| title= Walk to tie city's projects together | publisher=Land Legacy | accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> Much of Tulsa's convention space is located in downtown, such as the Tulsa Performing Arts Center and the [[Tulsa Convention Center]], and beginning in 2008, the [[BOK Center]]. Prominent downtown sub-districts include the Blue Dome District, the Brady Arts district, and the Greenwood Historical District. 

The large area between 61st Street and 121st Street is considered South Tulsa. This area was developed since the 1970s and contains a heavy concentration of chain retail stores, particularly along the 71st Street corridor. Mostly suburban in nature, South Tulsa contains large schools, neighborhood parks, and one of the state's largest shopping malls, [[Woodland Hills Mall]]. South Tulsa is particularly hilly and heavily wooded, and holds many of the city's most expensive and secluded homes. [[Southern Hills Country Club]], and [[Oral Roberts University]] are located in the area. East of Highway 169, East Tulsa is an area comprised mostly of modest residential neighborhoods developed since the 1960s. The area contains a diverse racial makeup, including a large [[Asian]] population and a "Little Mexico" district, in which large numbers of [[Hispanic]] immigrants have established a vibrant community centered around the Plaza Santa Cecelia near East 21st Street and Garnett Road. Areas of light industry and manufacture are also found in East Tulsa and the Harvey Young Airport, a public commuter airport, is located on the eastern edge of the area. [[Image:Tulsa River Skyline.jpg|thumb|right|The Arkansas River marks the division between West Tulsa and other regions of the city.]]
Areas of Tulsa west of the Arkansas River are called West Tulsa. This area has some of the city's largest parks and wilderness reserves. As a legacy of Tulsa's history in the oil industry, West Tulsa still contains several large oil refineries. In an area stretching from the north side of West Tulsa eastward and north of [[Interstate 244]], North Tulsa is home to a large percentage of Tulsa's [[African-American]] community. The area's [[Booker T. Washington]] High School, one of Tulsa’s African-American high schools during the segregation era and now a [[magnet school]], was judged in 2005 to be the 58th best high school in the United States by [[Newsweek]] Magazine.<ref name="The 100 Best Highschools in America">{{cite news | date=[[2006-05-16]] | url=http://http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7761678/site/newsweek/ | title= The 100 Best High Schools in America | first=Barbara | last=Kantrowitz | publisher=[[Newsweek]] | accessdate=2006-04-20}}</ref> Included in the region is the [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood Historic District]] and the adjacent campus of Oklahoma State University-Tulsa, the internationally famous [[Gilcrease Museum]], the Tulsa International Airport, the [[Tulsa Zoo]], the Tulsa Air and Space Museum, and the nation's third-largest municipal park, Mohawk Park.<ref name="Mowhawk Park - 3rd Largest">{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsazoo.org/general.asp?id=97| title=Zoo History | publisher=[[Tulsa Zoo and Living Museum]] | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> Many of the city's manufacturing and industrial areas are located in North Tulsa.

The largely residential district occupying land just south and east of Downtown and Uptown from the east bank of the Arkansas River to approximately Yale Avenue and 51st Street is known as Midtown Tulsa. This area, Tulsa's historical residential core, contains many upscale neighborhoods built in the early 1900s with architecture ranging from [[art deco]] to [[Greek Revival]]. The area contains many of the grandiose estates of former oil barons, including the [[Philbrook Museum]] mansion. The [[University of Tulsa]], the [[Swan Lake (Tulsa)|Swan Lake]] neighborhood, and the upscale shopping districts of [[Utica Square]], Cherry Street, and Brookside are located in Midtown.

For most of the 20th century, oil refinery and oil corporations dominated Tulsa's economy. Like the rest of Oklahoma, an oil bust in the 1980s severely compromised that economic foundation. Since then, city and county officials have been leading massive undertakings to diversify Tulsa's economy.

==Culture==

Tulsa's history has produced a population of southern settlers, northern oilmen, western [[ranchers]], and Native American tribes. Evident in mansions of former oil barons, [[indian gaming]] venues, and religious establishments, the city's culture has been shaped by this blend of driving forces. Though Oklahoma is placed entirely in the [[Southern United States]] by the [[United States Census Bureau]],<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.census.gov/geo/www/us_regdiv.pdf| title= Census Regions and Divisions of the United States| publisher= [[United States Census Bureau]] | accessdate=2006-05-11}}</ref> Tulsa is influenced by the nearby [[Midwest]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and [[Southern United States|Southern]] cultural regions.

The Tulsa-Bartlesville [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA),  is created by adding the nearby [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] micropolitan area which consists of [[Washington County, Oklahoma|Washington County]] in Northeastern Oklahoma. In 2006, US Census Estimates show the Tulsa-Bartlesville CMSA to have 946,993 residents. Cities and towns in this area include (in no particular order):

====Green Country====
{{main|Green Country}}

[[Green Country]] is a popular term used in different scenarios to describe different aspects of the Greater Tulsa Region, but may also refer specifically to the official Tulsa MSA. Each usage of the term is derived from its official meaning as the tourism designation for all of Northeastern Oklahoma. Its name was devised in the 1960s by the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation as one of six travel destination regions within the state, but is the most historically significant of all of them, as the name's usage can be traced to the early part of the 20th century.<ref name="Green Country Reborn">{{cite news | date=[[2003-09-15]] |url=http://www.tulsatoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=421&Itemid=2  | title=Vision of the Future Now, Part 3| first=David | last=Arnett | publisher=Tulsa Today | accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> While the Tulsa MSA only officially occupies a section of Green Country as it is defined by the [[Oklahoma Department of Transportation]], the entire region is sometimes referred to as the Greater Tulsa Area. On the same accord, the term "Green Country" often applies to the immediate Tulsa urban area or the city of Tulsa proper, but neither of these are technically the proper use for the term.
