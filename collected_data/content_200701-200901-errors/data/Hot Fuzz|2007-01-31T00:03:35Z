'''''Hot Fuzz''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[United Kingdom|British]] police action film written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]], known for ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Spaced]]''. Like ''Shaun of the Dead'' and ''Spaced'', it will star [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Nick Frost]].

==Plot==
Nicholas Angel ([[Simon Pegg]]) is the finest cop London has to offer, with an arrest record 400% higher than any other officer on the force. He’s so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel’s superiors send him to a place where his talents won’t be quite so embarrassing -- the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford.

Once there, he is partnered with the well-meaning but overeager police officer Danny Butterman ([[Nick Frost]]). The son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent), Danny is a huge action movie fan and believes his new big-city partner might just be a real-life "bad boy," and his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for. Angel is quick to dismiss this as childish fantasy and Danny’s puppy-like enthusiasm only adds to Angel’s growing frustration.
However, as a series of grisly accidents rocks the village, Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and as the intrigue deepens, Danny’s dreams of explosive, high-octane, car-chasing, gunfighting, all-out action seem more and more like a reality.
