The '''European Commission''' (formally the '''Commission of the European Communities''') is the [[executive (government)|executive]] body of the [[European Union]]. Alongside the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union]], it is one of the three main institutions governing the Union. 

Its primary roles are to propose and implement legislation, and to act as 'guardian of the [[EU treaties|treaties]]' which provide the legal basis for the EU. The role of the European Commission has many parallels with the executive body of a national government, but also differences (see below for details). 

The Commission consists of 27 Commissioners, one from each member state of the EU supported by an administrative body of about 23,000 European civil servants divided into departments called [[Directorate-General]]. The term "the Commission" is generally used to refer both to the administrative body in its entirety, and to the team of Commissioners who lead it. 

Unlike the [[Council of the European Union]], the Commission is intended to be a body independent of member states. Commissioners are therefore not permitted to take instructions from the government of the country that appointed them, but are supposed to represent the interests of the citizens of the EU as a whole.

The Commission is headed by a [[President of the European Commission|President]] (currently [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]]). Its headquarters are located in [[Brussels]], in a building known as the [[Berlaymont building|Berlaymont]], and its [[working language]]s are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].

The Commission differs from other institutions in the EU system through its '''power of initiative'''. This means that only the Commission has the authority to ''initiate'' legislation in the areas known as the "first pillar". However, the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Parliament]] are both able to formally request that the Commission legislate on a particular topic. In the areas that fall within the "second pillar" ([[Common Foreign & Security Policy (EU)|foreign policy and defence]]) and "third pillar" ([[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|criminal law]]), the Commission shares the power of initiating legislation with the European Council. 

The Commission also takes the role of '''guardian of the treaties''', which includes taking responsibility for initiating infringement proceedings at the [[European Court of Justice]] against member states and others who it considers to have breached the EU treaties and other community law. 

The Commission negotiates international [[trade]] agreements (in the [[World Trade Organization]]) and other international agreements on behalf of the EU. It closely co-operates in this with the [[Council of the European Union]].

The Commission is responsible for adopting technical measures to implement legislation adopted by the Council and, in most cases, the Parliament. This legislation is subject to the approval of committees made up of representatives of member states. This process is sometimes known by the jargon term of [[comitology]].

The Commission also [[regulation|regulates]] [[competition]] in the Union, vetting all mergers with Community-wide effects and initiating proceedings against companies which violate EU competition laws.

Finally, the Commission monitors member states' compliance with the Union's agreed Treaties and [[European Directive|Directives]], taking action against those in default.

===Decision-making procedure===
Individual commissioners take responsibility for advancing the work of European Commission in their areas of interest, but any key decisions are generally taken collectively by the Commission as a whole. To make this possible, there are regular meetings of all the Commissioners, which have two types of agenda items [http://ec.europa.eu/comm/atwork/collegemeetings/index_en.htm]:
*'''A-item''' is an item that is not controversial and can be passed without discussion
*'''B-item''' still needs discussion before being accepted

== Appointment and makeup of the Commission ==
=== President and Commissioners ===
{{main|President of the European Commission}} 
The President of the Commission is chosen by the [[European Council]], but the choice must be approved by the [[European Parliament]]. The remaining Commissioners are appointed by the member states in agreement with the President, who must decide the role of each Commissioner. Finally, the new Commission as a whole must be approved by the Parliament, on the basis of which the whole Commission is appointed by the Council of Ministers by qualified majority.

In addition to its role in approving a new Commission, the European Parliament has the power at any time to force the entire Commission to resign through a vote of no confidence. (This requires a vote that makes up at least two-thirds of those voting and a majority of the total membership of the Parliament. While it has never used this power, it threatened to use it against the Commission headed by [[Jacques Santer]] in 1999, with the result that the [[Resignation of the Santer Commission|whole Commission resigned of its own accord]]).

The present Commission, the [[Barroso Commission]], consists of 27 Commissioners. This Commission will serve from [[22 November]], [[2004]] to [[31 October]], [[2009]].

The [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement of the Union]] on [[1 May]] [[2004]] increased the number of member states from 15 to 25, and had an effect on the make-up of the Commission. Prior to this date, there were 20 Commissioners. In the months after May 2004 the size of the Commission was temporarily increased to 30 members - consisting of the 20 Commissioners already in post, plus one from each of the 10 acceding member states. The number was reduced to 25, with one Commissioner from each member state, when the Barroso commission took office in November 2004. With the acceding of Bulgaria and Romania as member states in 2007, the Commission further enlarged to 27 Commissioners.

If the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] had been adopted, the size of the Commission would have been further reduced. Member states would have taken it in turns to nominate Commissioners, with any given state making a nomination on two out of every three occasions that a new Commission were to be appointed. However, the Constitutional Treaty failed in 2005 via referenda in France and the Netherlands.

=== Directorates-General ===
{{main|Directorate-General}}

The Commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DG) that can be likened to [[Ministry (government department)|government ministries]]. The DGs cover either internal policies (e.g. the [[Directorate-General for Information Society and Media]]), external policies (e.g. the [[Directorate-General for External Relations]]) or internal services (e.g. the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]]).  Each Directorate-General is supervised by a senior [[civil service|civil servant]] known as the [[Director-General]], who reports directly to the Commissioner or Commissioners responsible for that policy area. [http://publications.eu.int/code/en/en-390600.htm (Full list of DGs)]

== History ==
The Commission originated in the High Authority of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which was established in 1951 under the terms of the Treaty Establishing the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1958 two further bodies were established under the terms of the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaties of Rome]]. These were the Commission of the [[European Economic Community]] and the Commission of the [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. Finally, in 1967, these three bodies merged to form the Commission of the European Communities, established under the terms of the [[Merger Treaty]]. This is the body that continues to exist to this day.

==Criticism of the Commission==
{{main|democratic deficit in the European Union}}

Many [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]]s argue that the European Commission, its appointment and powers exemplify the alleged [[democratic deficit in the European Union]]. The European Commission is led by Commissioners who are proposed by national governments and approved by the European Parliament, rather than being directly elected by citizens. Although the Commission has no legislative power, it is the only body empowered to draft legislative proposals and has some executive responsibilities. According to the Commission's detractors this concentrates an unacceptable level of power in what is an unelected institution. 

The alternative viewpoint on the Commission states that the policy areas in which it has power to initiate legislation are ill suited to an institution accountable to electoral pressures. In this respect the Commission has been compared with institutions such as independent [[Central Bank]]s which deal with technical areas of policy that are of little electoral salience. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Majone |first=Giandomenico |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |month= |title=Perils of Parliamentarization |journal=Governance |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=375 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>

Outside of this general debate there has been specific criticism of the Commission over certain proposals: for instance the [[Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]] or the [[European Political Parties Directive]].
