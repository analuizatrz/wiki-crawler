'''USS ''John P. Jackson''''' was a [[steamship]] in the [[United States Navy]].

''John P. Jackson'' was built at [[Brooklyn, New York]], in [[1860]] and purchased by the Navy at [[Newark, New Jersey]], from [[Jersey City Ferry Company]] on [[6 November]] [[1861]]. She was commissioned at [[New York Navy Yard]] on [[14 February]] [[1862]], Lieutenant [[Selim E. Woodworth]] in command.

''John P. Jackson'' was ordered to [[Key West]] on [[10 February]] to serve as one of the steamers in Comdr. [[David D. Porter]]'s mother flotilla. On [[30 March]] she arrived at Ship Island from Key West as Flag Officer Farragut assembled vessels for his campaign against [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. While Farragut labored to move his deep-draft, sea-going ships across the bar into the [[Mississippi River]], ''John P. Jackson'' was part of the task force which secured [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]] on [[4 April]]. During the operation she joined [[USS New London (1859)|USS ''New London'']] and [[USS Hatteras (1861)|USS ''Hatteras'']] in driving off [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] steamers [[CSS Carondelet|''Carondelet'']], [[CSS Pamlico|''Pamlico'']], and [[CSS Oregon|''Oregon'']] as they attempted to prevent the Union landing which wrested the area around [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] from the South. The same day ''John P. Jackson'' captured steamer ''P. C. Wallis'' with a cargo of naval stores.

She next escorted [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|General Butler]]'s occupation troop ships to the Mississippi passes while towing [[United States Army|Army]] transport ''Great Republic''. Leaving the Army vessels at the mouth of the Mississippi to await the outcome of the impending naval effort against New Orleans, ''John P. Jackson'' joined the mortar boats for the intense bombardment of [[Fort St. Philip|Forts St. Philip]] and [[Fort Jackson (Louisiana)|Jackson]]. The cannonade began [[18 April]] and lasted until Farragut's ships had safely passed the Confederate batteries 6 days later, dooming the Southern riverside strongholds and the metropolis which they had fought to protect. 

''John P. Jackson'' again supported Farragut when he ran the gauntlet at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] almost 2 months later to meet Flag Officer [[Charles Henry Davis]], who had battled south along the Mississippi valley. Braving the fire of skillfully used Vicksburg cannons, Porter's flotilla peppered the Southern emplacements with shell, grape, and shrapnel throughout the daring dash. During the fray ''John P. Jackson'' was hit twice by 7-inch rifle projectiles, leaving her without power and causing other serious damage. Moments later [[USS Clifton (1861)|''Clifton'']], coming to her aid with a towline, was struck in her starboard boiler; seven men were killed by scalding steam. ''John P. Jackson'' quickly lowered her boats to save a number of other men who had been forced overboard by the steam. 

After repairs at New Orleans, ''John P. Jackson'' was ordered to Mississippi Sound on [[30 September]] for reconnaissance work; and she served there throughout the remainder of the war. Fire broke out in her engineering spaces on [[8 October]], but efficient and courageous damage control action extinguished the blaze and saved the ship. She captured sloop ''Young Gustave'' in Mississippi Sound on [[21 October]], and diligently performed blockade duty in the months that followed. On [[12 September]] [[1863]] she cooperated with [[USS Genesee (1862)|''Genesee'']] and [[USS Calhoun (1851)|''Calhoun'']] in chasing steamer ''Fanny'' ashore where she was burned to prevent her falling into Union hands. The next day the same team engaged Confederate steamer [[CSS Jeff Davis|''Jeff Davis'']], forcing her to withdraw to the shelter of batteries at Grant's Pass. The Union vessels then silenced the Grant's Pass guns. ''John P. Jackson'' overhauled and took schooner ''Syrena'' bound from Biloxi to Pascagoula on [[21 October]].

Admiral Farragut's next major objective was [[Mobile Bay]]. ''John P. Jackson'' was on hand at the outset of the campaign on [[16 February]] [[1864]] when she towed three [[schooner]]s into position for the bombardment of [[Fort Powell]] and then joined in the cannonade. For the next 6 months she operated from New Orleans supporting the operations which culminated on [[5 August]] in Admiral Farragut's stirring victory. 

''John P. Jackson'' captured the schooner ''Medora'' in Mississippi Sound on [[8 December]] [[1864]], and continued to serve in the [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]] until after the end of the war. She departed [[Pensacola Navy Yard]] on [[26 July]] [[1865]] and two days later arrived New Orleans, where she decommissioned [[5 September]]. She was sold at public auction in New Orleans to Marcy, Maury & Co. on [[27 September]] [[1865]]. She was renamed ''J. P. Jackson'' on [[3 October]] [[1865]] and was later abandoned in 1871.
