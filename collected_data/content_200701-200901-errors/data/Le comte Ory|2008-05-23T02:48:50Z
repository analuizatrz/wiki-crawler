{{Rossini  operas}}'''''Le comte Ory''''' is an [[opera]] written by [[Gioacchino Rossini]] in [[1828]]. Some of the music originates from his opera ''[[Il viaggio a Reims]]'' written three years earlier for the [[coronation]] of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]].<ref>Osborne, Richard: ''Rossini's life (p.18)'' in 'The Cambridge Companion to Rossini', Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-00195-1.</ref>
The work is ostensibly a [[comic opera]] in that the story is humorous, even farcical; however it was devised for the [[Académie Royale de Musique|Opéra]] rather than for the [[Opéra-Comique|Théatre de l'Opéra-Comique]]; and there are structural inconsistencies with the contemporary ''[[opéra comique]]'' genre: whereas the latter consists of relatively short lyrical numbers and spoken dialogue, ''Le comte Ory'' consists of "highly developed, even massive musical forms"<ref>Holden, Amanda with Nicholas Kenyon and Stephen Walsh, ''The Viking Opera Guide'', Viking 1993 ISBN 0-670-81292-7</ref> linked by [[recitative]].

==Performance history==

== Synopsis ==
The setting is approximately the year [[1200]]. 
Count Ory is an oversexed youth who neglects his studies to go about with his friends looking for pleasure and excitement. The real men of the community are away at the wars (in fact, a Crusade) so  the local aristocratic lady, the Countess of Formoutiers, and all the women of her household are securely locked up in the castle, waiting for the return of their menfolk. Count Ory comes up with the idea that he and his pals should disguise themselves as nuns to gain access to the castle in the hope of seducing the women. They acquire some dirty habits and for a while their plan seems to be working. Then the real men return.
