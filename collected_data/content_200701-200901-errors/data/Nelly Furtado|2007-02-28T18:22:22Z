==Biography==
===Early years and influences===  
Furtado, a second-generation [[Portuguese Canadian]], was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] as one of three children to Maria Manuela and António José Furtado, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] immigrants from [[São Miguel Island]] in the [[Azores]]. She was named after [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[gymnast]] [[Nellie Kim]].Later in her early years,at the age of five Nelly and her family moved to OakHarbor, Washington a small community on a island near seattle.She had many friends in this town.

Furtado's parents emigrated from [[Portugal]] to [[Canada]] in the late 1970s.<ref name=rsjan01>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5918613/furtado_goes_portuguese/|title=Furtado Goes Portuguese |work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=27 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She has stated that visiting her parents' birthplace, the Azores islands, as a child experiencing its culture and learning the [[Portuguese language]] has made her an open-minded person.<ref name=ym/> This has strongly influenced her artistry as she has incorporated many cross-cultural sounds into her music. It is also evident in her multilingualism as she can speak [[English language|English]], Portuguese, and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name=ym/>  Furtado has acknowledged her parents as the source of her strong work ethic; she spent eight summers working as a [[chambermaid]] with her mother, who was a [[Housekeeper (servant)|housekeeper]] in Victoria.<ref name=amg> {{cite web|url=http://www.allmusicguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:lcaxlfjekcqe~T1|title=Nelly Furtado Biography|work=All Music Guide|accessdate=27 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She has stated that coming from a working class background has shaped her identity in a positive way.<ref name=ym/> She has also said that her [[Roman Catholic]] background and attending church was "a big part of life".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nellyfurtado/articles/story/5931858/fly_girl|title=Fly Girl |work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=16 Aug|accessyear=2001}}</ref>

Furtado first sang at the age of four when she performed a duet with her mother at church on [[Portugal Day]].<ref name=ym/> She began playing instruments at the age of nine, learning the [[trombone]], [[ukulele]] and, in later years, the [[guitar]] and [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. She began writing songs at the age of twelve<ref name=ym/> and, as a teenager, she played in a Portuguese marching band.<ref name=rsjan01/>

During these early years, Furtado embraced many musical genres, listening heavily to mainstream [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[alternative rock]], [[New Wave music|New Wave]], [[alternative hip hop]], [[trip hop]], [[world music]] (including [[Music of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[fado]], [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian]] [[bossa nova]], and [[Music of India|Indian music]]), and a variety of others.<ref name=ym/><ref name=amg/> Her influences have included [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Amalia Rodrigues]], [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[Cornershop]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Digable Planets]], [[De La Soul]], [[Radiohead]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[The Verve]], [[U2]], and [[Beck]].<ref name=ym/><ref name=mm/><ref name=amg/>

Furtado's music has also been influenced by her current residence, [[Toronto]], which she calls "the most multicultural city in the entire world" and a place where she "can be any culture".<ref name=rsjun06>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10603268/why_is_nelly_furtados_new_album_so_loud|title=Why Is Nelly Furtado's New Album So Loud?|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=1 July|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Growing up in Canada and experiencing Toronto's cultural diversity, she has said that she did not have to wait for the [[Internet]] revolution to learn about world music; she began listening to it at the age of fifteen and continues to discover new genres. On a 2006 [[Rolling Stone]] issue, she commented about her diverse taste:

{{cquote|I always know there's a new genre left to discover. For me, it's like a metaphor for life. I feel like if you can get down with any style of music, you can get down with any style of person. So it's fun for me—I get to expose my fans to different vibes and they, in turn, open their minds too. I'm always undergoing mind-opening.<ref name=rsjun06/>}}

The first musicians Furtado interacted with were underground [[Rapping|rappers]] and [[Disc jockey|DJs]].<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/f/furtado_nelly/qa_feature_060706/|title=How Nelly Furtado Got Her Ghetto Pass|work=MTV|accessdate=16 August|accessyear=2006|last=Shepherd|first=Julianne}}</ref> During a visit to Toronto, after the summer of eleventh grade, she met Tallis Newkirk, member of hip hop group Plains of Fascination and contributed vocals to their 1996 album ''Join the Ranks'' on the track "Waitin' 4 the Streets".<ref name=nelstar>{{cite web |url=http://www.nelstar-project.com/about/nelstar|title=Nelstar* (Nelly Furtado) Biography|work=Nelstar-Project.com|accessdate=9 December |accessyear=2005}}</ref> She spent the rest of that summer in Portugal, opening her mind to native rock acts and then returned to British Columbia. After graduating from Mount Douglas Secondary School in 1996, she moved to Toronto where she eventually formed the [[trip hop]] duo Nelstar in 1997 with Newkirk. The experience led her back to her hip-hop influences and allowed her to become more comfortable with writing her own melodies and rhymes.<ref name=amg/> Although, "Like", one of the songs Nelstar recorded, received a [[VideoFACT]] grant to cover for the production of a [[music video]], Furtado felt the trip-hop style of the duo was "too segregated" and believed it did not represent her personality or allow her to showcase her vocal ability.<ref name=nelstar/> She left the group and decided to move back home.

Before moving, she performed at the 1997 Honey Jam, a female, mostly-black talent show at Toronto nightclub [[Lee's Palace]]. She performed to a [[Digital Audio Tape]] in jeans and a t-shirt.<ref name=nelstar/> At the club, [[The Philosopher Kings]] singer [[Gerald Eaton]] (aka Jarvis Church) was impressed with her performance and approached her to write with him. Eaton and fellow Kings member Brian West, collectively known as Track and Field, helped Furtado produce a [[Demo (music)|demo]], but she already had plans to backpack through Europe and return home to take [[creative writing]] courses at [[Camosun College]]. She stayed in touch with Eaton and West who insisted that she return to Toronto to record more material. She eventually returned for two weeks; the material recorded during those sessions led to her record deal with [[DreamWorks Records]] in 1999.<ref name=mm/>

Nelly's first single, "Party's Just Begun (Again)", was released that year on the [[Brokedown Palace: Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]].

===2000–2002: ''Whoa, Nelly!''===
[[Image:Whoanelly.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'' (2000)]]
Furtado continued to collaborate with Eaton and West, who co-produced her debut album, ''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'', which was released in October 2000.  The album saw major success all over the globe supported by its singles, "[[I'm like a Bird]]", "[[Turn off the Light]]", "[[...On the Radio (Remember the Days)]]", and "[[Hey, Man!]]".  It received four [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations in 2002, and her debut single won for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].

Furthermore, Furtado was critically acclaimed for her innovative mixture of various genres and sounds. ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' magazine called the album "a delightful and refreshing antidote to the army of 'pop princesses' and rap-metal bands that had taken over popular music at the turn of the millennium."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=74|title=Whoa, Nelly!|work=Slant|accessdate=28 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref>  The sound of the album was strongly influenced by musicians who had traversed cultures and "the challenge of making heartfelt, emotional music that's upbeat and hopeful."<ref name=mm/>  Following the release of the album, Furtado headlined the ''Burn in the Spotlight'' tour and also appeared on [[Moby]]'s ''[[Area Festival|Area:One]]'' tour.

===2003–2005: ''Folklore''===
Before the release of her [[sophomore album]], ''[[Folklore (album)|Folklore]]'', Furtado gave birth to her first child, daughter Nevis (purportedly named for the [[Caribbean]] island [[Nevis]] on which she was conceived but in actuality named for the Latin word "Nevi."<ref>confirmed by Furtado on [[Australia]]'s ''[[Kyle & Jackie O]]'' on [[August 7]] [[2006]]</ref>) On [[September 20]] [[2003]] in Toronto, she had a [[home birth]] with [[Midwifery|midwives]]. She has said about motherhood, "It's actually pretty incredible. It's a lot more instinctual than I thought."<ref name=mom>{{cite web |url=http://launch.yahoo.com/read/news/12176136|title=Singer Nelly Furtado Loving Motherhood|work=Associated Press|accessdate=28 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Nevis's father is Furtado's then  boyfriend, [[Disc jockey|DJ]]/[[record producer|producer]] Jasper Gahunia a.k.a. Lil' Jaz. Furtado and Gahunia, who broke up in 2005, were together for four years and friends for several years before that. She has stated, "We're fully active co-parents and really close friends, so things are irie."<ref name=blender>{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1968|title=Nelly Furtado: Free As A Bird|work=Blender|accessdate=1 July|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Nevis is ethnically a quarter [[Philippines|Filipino]], a quarter [[India]]n, and half Portuguese. Furtado has chosen to raise her in Toronto due to the city's cultural diversity, open-mindedness, and [[grassroots]] [[political activism]].<ref name=rsjun06/>

Furtado's second album, ''[[Folklore (album)|Folklore]]'', was released in November 2003. The title was influenced by her parents immigration to Canada, "when I look at my old photo albums, I see pictures of their brand-new house, their shiny new car, their first experiences going to very North American-type places like [[Kmart]]. When you have that in your blood, you never really part with it—it becomes your own personal folklore."<ref name=interview>{{cite web |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_10_33/ai_109085151|title=Interview: Nelly Furtado|work=Interview|accessdate=29 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The album also displayed a diverse sound but with a more rock-oriented, acoustic approach.<ref name=amazon>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DFZZA/102-4956428-7887337?v=glance&n=5174|title=Folklore|work=Amazon.com|accessdate=28 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref>  As she focused more on the songwriting rather "than on frenetically switching genres five times in one song,"<ref name=interview/> ''[[BBC]]'' felt that it had "twice the originality" of her debut.<ref name=folklore>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/urban/reviews/furtado_folklore.shtml|title=Folklore|work=BBC|accessdate=28 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Furtado attributed the mellowness of the album to the fact that she was pregnant during most of its recording.<ref name=interview/> The final track on the album, "Childhood Dreams", is dedicated to her daughter.

The album includes the single "[[Força]]" (meaning "strength" or "carry on" in Portuguese), which was written as the official anthem of the [[2004 European Football Championship]].  Furtado performed the song at the championship's final in [[Lisbon]], Portugal in July 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/35794/articles/story/5937297|title=Nelly Furtado Gets Her Kicks|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=9 December|accessyear=2005}}</ref> Other singles included the ballad "[[Try (song)|Try]]" and "[[Powerless (Say What You Want)]]".

The album was not as successful as her debut, partly due to troubles at DreamWorks Records and the less poppy sound.<ref name=folklore/>  It lacked promotion because DreamWorks was sold to [[Universal Music Group]] at the time of ''Folkore'''s release.  In 2005, DreamWorks Records was shut down, and many of its artists, including Furtado, were absorbed into [[Geffen Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/11/12/122339.php|title=Universal Music Snags DreamWorks Records|work=Blogcritics.org|accessdate=29 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===2006–present: ''Loose''===
[[Image:Loose cover.jpg|thumb|''[[Loose (album)|Loose]]'' (2006)]]
Furtado's third album, ''[[Loose (album)|Loose]]'', was released in June 2006.  It was named after the spontaneous, creative decisions she faced while creating the album.<ref name=rsfeb06> {{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9325140/nelly_furtado_brings_the_punkhop|title=Nelly Furtado Brings the Punk-Hop |work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=28 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name=usajuly06> {{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2006-07-13-female-singers_x.htm|title=Serious female singers harder to find on the charts |work=USA Today|accessdate=14 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Four lead singles were released in different regions of the world: the Spanish [[reggaeton]]-influenced "[[No Hay Igual]]" (featuring [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]]), the hip-hop "[[Promiscuous (song)|Promiscuous]]" (featuring [[Timbaland]]), for which she won a 2006 [[Billboard Music Award]] for Pop Single of the Year, the [[Latin American music|latin]] "[[Te Busqué]]" (featuring [[Juanes]]) and the pop "[[Maneater (Nelly Furtado song)|Maneater]]".  For the first time, Furtado worked with a variety of record producers and followed a more collaborative approach in creating the album.  The album, mostly produced by Timbaland, showed her experimenting with a more R&B–hip hop sound and the "surreal, theatrical elements of '80s music".<ref name=umusic> {{cite web |url=http://umusic.ca/nellyfurtado/|title=  Nelly Furtado :: Loose |work=umusic.ca|accessdate=21 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She has categorized the album's sound as ''punk-hop'', which she describes as "this modern, poppy, spooky music" and stated that "there's a mysterious, after-midnight vibe to [it] that's extremely visceral".<ref name=rsfeb06/> She attributed the youthful sound of the album to the presence of her two-year old daughter.<ref name=umusic/>

{{multi-listen end}}
{{sample box end}}
Furtado also wanted the album to sound more like her demo tapes which she prefers over her finished albums.  She recalls, "The cool thing is we did the mixes as we went. The whole album is a board mix theoretically. We didn't bring in the fancy mixer at the end".<ref name=rsjun06/> During the album's creation, she listened to several [[Electro (music)|electro]] and [[hard rock]] musicians including [[System of a Down]] and [[Death from Above 1979]] who influenced the rock sounds present on the album and the "coughing, laughing, distorted bass lines" which were kept in the songs deliberately.<ref name=rsjun06/>

''Loose'' became the most successful album of Furtado's career, reaching number-one in several countries including the United States and Canada and producing the hit singles "Promiscuous", "Maneater", "[[Say It Right]]", and "[[All Good Things (Come to an End)]]".  The album received generally positive reviews from critics,<ref name=metacritic>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/furtadonelly/loose|title=Loose by Nelly Furtado|work=Metacritic|accessdate=16 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> with some citing the "revitalising" effect of Timbaland on Furtado's music,<ref name=musicomh>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums5/nelly-furtado-2_0606.htm|title=Nelly Furtado - Loose (Polydor)|work=MusicOMH|last=Murphy|first=John|accessdate=16 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name=amgloose>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:65rv284w05oa~T1|title=Loose Review|work=All Music Guide|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|accessdate=16 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> and others calling it "slick, smart and surprising."<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1792851,00.html|title=Nelly Furtado, Loose|work=Guardian Unlimited Arts|last=Lynskey|first=Dorian|accessdate=16 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In June 2006, in an interview with ''[[Genre (magazine)|Genre]]'' magazine, when asked if she had "ever felt an attraction to women", Furtado replied "Absolutely. Women are beautiful and sexy." She also said the idea that everyone was inherently bisexual made sense to her and agreed with [[Kurt Cobain]]'s statement that "everyone is gay" from [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[All Apologies]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genremagazine.com/2006/6-1/magazine/content/nelly.cfm|title=Nelly on the Loose! |work=Genre|accessdate=26 July|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Some considered this an announcement of [[bisexuality]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afterellen.com/column/2006/7/21.html|title=Best. Lesbian. Week. Ever. |work=AfterEllen|accessdate=26 July|accessyear=2006}}</ref> but in August 2006, she confirmed that she was "straight, but very open-minded".  She commented that she was slightly embarrassed by the quotes and stated, "I guess I was humouring the journalist a little and I was reading a book about Chinese medicine, and we went off on a tangent."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3760561a1860,00.html|title=Furtado red-faced over loose tongue|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=11 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In November 2006, Furtado announced that her world tour will begin in Canada on [[January 31]] [[2007]].  The first date is in [[London, Ontario]], and she will tour five continents.<ref>http://www.nellyfurtado.com/news/default.aspx?nid=9323</ref>  Furtado and [[Justin Timberlake]] are featured on [[Timbaland]]'s upcoming single "[[Give It to Me]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1545914/20061115/timbaland.jhtml|title=Timbaland Nabs 50 Cent, Dr. Dre For LP, Starts Timberlake Gossip Frenzy |work=MTV News |accessdate=1 December|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In late November, Furtado said that she turned down [[U.S. dollar|US $]]500,000 to pose fully clothed in ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref name=Spanish>{{cite web |url=http://www.dose.ca/music/story.html?id=a2a15933-27c3-4bb0-ba34-945f917a93f2&k=44074|title=Nelly Embraces Her Roots with Spanish album|work=Dose|accessdate=6 January|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Furtado announced in December 2006 that she would be recording an [[Nelly Furtado's First Spanish Album|all-Spanish album]]. She plans to include her previous Spanish songs, translations of her older tracks, and new songs.<ref name=Spanish/>

She performed "Say It Right" and "[[Promiscuous (song)|Promiscuous]]" (with [[Saukrates]]) on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]'' on [[February 23]], [[2007]].

Furtado will host the [[Juno Awards]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] on April 1, 2007.

There are strong rumors that Loose will be re-released in mid 2007 but it is unknown what the track list will look like

==Acting career==
Furtado began acting in school plays in middle school.  She formally began studying acting after she planned to appear in a [[Hindi]] film which never came to fruition.<ref name=rsjun06/>  Acting courses taught her to "let go of [her] ego and feel really grounded"; this influenced the theme and creation of her third album ''Loose''.  She prepared for a role in a second film, the independent drama ''[[Nobody's Hero]]'' (2006),<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.andpop.com/article/5015|title=  Nelly Furtado Signs on for Movie Role|work=andPOP|accessdate=31 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> but plans fell through as filming conflicted with the promotion of ''Loose''.<ref name=rsjun06/>

She appeared on the "Some Buried Bones" episode of ''[[CSI: NY]]'' as sexually abused master-thief Ava Brandt. The episode also featured her songs "Maneater" and "All Good Things (Come to an End)."
