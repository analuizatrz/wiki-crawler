'''Tropical cyclone forecasting''' is the science and art of forecasting where a tropical cyclone's center, and its effects, are expected to be at some point in the future.  There are several elements to tropical cyclone forecasting:  track forecasting, intensity forecasting, rainfall forecasting, storm surge, and tornado forecasting.

==Track==

===Basics===
The large scale synoptic flow determines 70 to 90 percent of a tropical cyclone's motion.  The deep layer mean flow is considered to be the best tool in determining track direction and speed.  If storms are significantly sheared, use of a lower level wind such as the 700 hPa pressure surface (3000&nbsp;meters or 10000&nbsp;feet above sea level) will work out as a better predictor.  Knowledge of the beta effect can be used to steer a tropical cyclone, since it leads to a more northwest heading for tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere.  For example, the beta effect will act poleward and slighty to the right on a tropical cyclone track the south of the subtropical ridge.  Northwest moving storms move quicker and left, while northeast moving storms move slower and left.  The larger the cyclone, the larger the impact of the beta effect is likely to be.  It is also best to smooth out short term wobbles of the storm center in order to determine a more accurate trajectory.<ref>U. S. Navy. [http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/~chu/chap4/se100.htm SECTION 1.

===Forecast models===
{{seealso|Tropical cyclone prediction model}}
Because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system.  High-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce [[tropical cyclone prediction model|computer models]] that forecast tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems.  Combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones, and a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors, scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades.<ref name="NHC forecast verifications models">{{cite web | author = [[National Hurricane Center]] | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify6.shtml?#FIG1 | work = National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification | title = Annual average model track errors for Atlantic basin tropical cyclones for the period 1994-2005, for a homogeneous selection of "early" models | accessdate = 2006-11-30 | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | date = [[May 22]], [[2006]]}}</ref>  The addition of dropwindsonde missions around tropical cyclones in what are known as synoptic flow missions in the Atlantic Basin decreased track error by by 15-20 percent.<ref>B. Geerts. [http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap13/tc_track.html Tropical cyclone track forecasting.] Retrieved on [[2007-04-10]].</ref>  An accurate track forecast is important, because if the track forecast is incorrect, forecasts for intensity, rainfall, storm surge, and tornado threat will also be incorrect.

==Intensity==
Forecasters say they are less skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones than cyclone track.<ref name="NHC forecast verifications Atlantic">{{cite web | author = [[National Hurricane Center]] | work = National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify5.shtml? | title = Annual average official track errors for Atlantic basin tropical cyclones for the period 1989-2005, with least-squares trend lines superimposed | accessdate = 2006-11-30 | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | date = [[May 22]], [[2006]]}}</ref>  They attribute the lack of improvement in intensity forecasting to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development.  However, an accurate track forecast is essential to creating accurate intensity forecasts, particularly in an area with large islands such as the western north Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, as proximity to land is an inhibiting factor to developing tropical cyclones.

==Rainfall==

{{seealso|Tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting}}
Tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting is important, since between 1970-2004, inland flooding from tropical cyclones caused a majority of the fatalities from tropical cyclones in the [[United States]].<ref name="Inland Flooding">Ed Rappaport. [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/inland_flood.shtml Inland Flooding.] Retrieved on [[2006-06-24]].</ref>  While [[flood]]ing is common to tropical cyclones near a landmass, there are a few factors which lead to excessive rainfall from tropical cyclones.  Slow motion, as was seen during [[Hurricane Danny (1997)]] and [[Hurricane Wilma]], can lead to high amounts.  The presence of topography near the coast, as is the case across much of [[Mexico]], [[Haiti]], the [[Dominican Republic]], much of [[Central America]], [[Madagascar]], [[RÃ©union]], [[China]], and [[Japan]] acts to magnify amounts due to upslope flow into the mountains.  Strong upper level forcing from a trough moving through the Westerlies, as was the case during [[Hurricane Floyd]], can lead to high amounts even from systems moving at an average forward motion.  A combination of two of these factors could be especially crippling, as was seen during [[Hurricane Mitch]] in [[Central America]].<ref name="Are You Ready?">{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/areyouready/hurricanes.shtm |title= Are You Ready?|accessdate=2006-06-24 |date=2006-04-05 |publisher=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]}}</ref>  Therefore, an accurate track forecast is essential in order to produce an accurate tropical cyclone rainfall forecast.<ref>William M.

==Storm surge==
{{seealso|Storm surge}}
The main storm surge forecast model in the Atlantic basin is '''SLOSH''', which stands for '''S'''ea, '''L'''ake, '''O'''verland, '''S'''urge from '''H'''urricanes.<ref>FEMA. [http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/nhp/slosh_link.shtm Sea, Lake, Overland, Surge from Hurricanes.] Retrieved on [[2007-04-10]].</ref>  It uses the size of a storm, its intensity, its forward motion, and the topography of the coastal plain to estimate the depth of a storm surge at any individual grid point across the [[United States]].  An accurate forecast track is required in order to produce accurate storm surge forecasts.  However, if the landfall point is uncertain, a maximum envelope of water (MEOW) map can be generated based on the direction of approach.  If the forecast track itself is also uncertain, a maximum of maximums {MoM) map can be generated which will show the worst possible scenario for a hurricane of a specific strength.<ref>PC Weather Products.

==Tornado==
The location of most tropical cyclone-related tornadoes is their northeast quadrant in the Northern Hemisphere and southeast quadrant in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>Roger Edwards.
