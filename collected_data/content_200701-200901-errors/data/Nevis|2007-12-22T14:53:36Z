'''Nevis''' (pronounced nee-vis) is an [[island]] in the [[Caribbean]], located near the northern end of the [[Lesser Antilles]] archipelago, about 220 miles (350 km) southeast of [[Puerto Rico]] and 50 miles (80 km) west of [[Antigua]]. The 36 square-mile (93 km²) island is part of the inner arc of the [[Leeward Islands]] chain. The capital of Nevis is [[Charlestown, Nevis|Charlestown]]. 

Nevis, along with [[Saint Kitts]], forms the [[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]. The two islands are separated by a shallow 2-mile (3.22 km) channel, known as "The Narrows". Nevis is conical in shape, with a volcanic peak, Nevis Peak, at the centre. It is fringed on three sides by long sand [[beach]]es, and has a [[coastline]] intermittently protected by [[coral reef]]s. The most popular beach is the 4-mile (6.44 km) long Pinney's Beach, on the western or [[Caribbean]] coast. The gently sloping coastal plain (0.6 miles/1 km wide) has natural fresh water springs, as well as non-potable volcanic [[hot spring]]s, especially along the west coast.  

The island was named ''Oualie'' ("Land of Beautiful Waters") by the [[Caribs]] and ''Dulcina'' ("Sweet Island") by the early British settlers. The name ''Nevis'' is derived from the Spanish ''Nuestra Señora de las Nieves''  or [[Our Lady of the Snows]], and first appears on maps in the 16th century.<ref name="Hubbard">Hubbard, Vincent K. (2002). ''Swords, Ships & Sugar: History of Nevis''. Corvallis, OR: Premiere, ISBN 1-891519-05-0, pp. 20-23 (Captain Gilbert, Captain Smith), 25 (pearl diving), 41-44 (name Dulcina, treaty with Spain, first settlement), 69-70 (privateers, Captain Francis), 79-85 (slave trade, Royal African Company, Queen of the Caribees), 86-102 (Caribs), 113-120 (d'Iberville, buccaneers), 138-139 (Great Britain's wealth derived from West Indian sugar and slave trade, 1776 starvation), 194-195 (Alexandra Hospital), 211-223 (electricity, Anguilla in 1967, OECD blacklist).</ref>  

The majority of the approximately 12,000 citizens of Nevis are of primarily African descent. English is the official language, and the literacy rate, 98 percent, is one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere. Nevis is of particular historical significance to Americans because it was the birthplace and early childhood home of [[Alexander Hamilton]]. For British people, Nevis is the place where [[Horatio Nelson]] as a young sea captain, was stationed, and where he met and married Frances Nisbet, a young plantation widow.

==History==
===Amerindians===
When Nevis was spotted by Columbus in [[1493]], the island had already been settled for more than 2,000 years by Caribbean Amerindian populations. Since the 1990s, [[artifacts]] from three major prehistoric periods have been discovered at excavation sites in Nevis.<ref>See for example [http://www.arch.soton.ac.uk/Projects/default.asp?ProjectID=12 Nevis Heritage excavation reports, 2000-2002], Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton. Retrieved 8 Aug. 2006.</ref> 

The indigenous people of Nevis during these periods belonged to the Leeward Island Amerindian groups popularly referred to as [[Arawaks]] and [[Caribs]], a complex mosaic of ethnic groups with similar culture and language.<ref name="Wilson">Wilson, Samuel (1990). "The Prehistoric Settlement Pattern of Nevis, West Indies". ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 16, No. 4  (Winter 1989), p. 427-450.</ref> Dr. Lennox Honychurch from Dominica (D. Phil. in Anthropology and a leading scholar in the history and culture of Island Caribs) traces the European use of the term "Carib" for the Leeward Island aborigines to Columbus, who picked it up from the [[Tainos]] on [[Hispaniola]]. It was not a name the Island Caribs called themselves.<ref name="Honychurch">Honychurch, Lennox (1997). "Crossroads in the Caribbean: A Site of Encounter and Exchange on Dominica". ''World Archaeology'' Vol. 28(3): 291-304.</ref> The Spanish used the term to clarify which native groups were officially available for enslavement. "Carib Indians" was the generic name used for all groups allegedly involved in war rituals of a cannibalistic nature, namely the consumption of parts of a killed enemy's body. The Spanish law permitted and encouraged the enslavement of all such "cannibals" or "Caribs".  

The Amerindian name for Nevis was ''Oualie'', land of beautiful waters. The structure of the Island Carib language has been linguistically identified as [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]].<ref name="Honychurch" /> This is used as an argument to support the Arawakan Continuity Model for the Leeward Islands. According to the continuity model, the many ethnic groups of the Leeward Islands lived side by side through the centuries before the Europeans arrived, becoming multilingual because of intense inter-island trade. The suggestion that a natural merging of languages and cultures occurred over the centuries is in sharp contrast with the invasion and displacement model which has previously been the dominant model in Caribbean scholarship. The displacement model suggests that the [[Cariban languages|Cariban speaking]] groups killed off the Arawakan groups, but that the Arawakan language survived because the Carib warriors spared the Arawak women and the women then passed Arawakan on to their children. Many scholars now subscribe to moderated continuity models, considering the Caribbean to have been a site of encounter and exchange throughout history.<ref name="Honychurch" />
 
Nevis was part of the Spanish claim to the Caribbean islands, a claim pursued until 1671, even though there were no Spanish settlements on the island. According to Vincent Hubbard, author of ''Swords, Ships & Sugar: History of Nevis'', the Spanish ruling caused many of the Arawak groups who were not ethnically Caribs to "be redefined as Caribs overnight".<ref name="Hubbard"/> Records indicate that the Spanish enslaved large numbers of the native inhabitants on the more accessible of the Leeward Islands and sent them to Cubagua, [[Venezuela]] to dive for pearls. Hubbard suggests that the reason the first European settlers found so few "Caribs" on Nevis is that they had already been rounded up by the Spanish and shipped off to be used as slaves.

Christopher Columbus initially gave the island the name ''San Martin'' (Saint Martin), but the confusion of numerous poorly-charted small islands in the Leeward Island chain meant that this name ended up being transferred to another island in the group. The current name ''Nevis''  was derived from a Spanish name ''Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'' by a process of abbreviation and [[anglicization]]. The name originally meant [[Our Lady of the Snows]]. It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is a reference to the story of a 4th century Catholic miracle: a snowfall on a mountain near Rome. Presumably the white clouds that usually wreathe the top of Nevis Peak made someone think of this story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate.

===Colonial era===
In spite of the Spanish claim, Nevis continued to be a popular stop-over point for English and Dutch ships on their way to the North American continent. Captain Bartholomew Gilbert of Plymouth visited the island in 1603, spending two weeks to cut twenty tons of [[lignum vitae]] wood. Gilbert sailed on to [[Virginia]] to seek out survivors of the [[Roanoke settlement]] in what is now [[North Carolina]]. [[Captain John Smith]] visited Nevis also on his way to Virginia in 1607. This was the voyage which founded the [[Jamestown Settlement]], the first permanent English settlement in the New World.<ref name="Hubbard" />

On August 30, 1620, [[James I of England]] asserted sovereignty over Nevis by giving a Royal Patent for colonisation to the [[Earl of Carlisle]]. However, actual European settlement did not happen until 1628 when Anthony Hilton moved from nearby Saint Kitts following a murder plot against him. He was accompanied by 80 other settlers, soon to be boosted by a further 100 settlers from London who had originally hoped to settle [[Barbuda]]. Hilton became the first Governor of Nevis. After the 1671 peace treaty between Spain and England, Nevis became the seat of the British colony and the [[Admiralty Court]] also sat in Nevis. Between 1675 and 1730, the island was the headquarter for the slave trade for the Leeward Islands, with approximately 6,000-7,000 enslaved West Africans passing through on route to other islands each year. The [[Royal African Company]] brought all its ships through Nevis.<ref name="Hubbard"/>

[[Image:Nevis FrenchSlavetrade.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of French slave trade in the 1876 book ''The 18th Century: Its Institutions, Customs, and Costumes: France, 1700-1789''.]] Due to the profitable [[Triangular trade]] and the high quality of Nevisian [[sugar cane]], the island soon became a dominant source of wealth for [[Great Britain]] and the slave-owning British plantocracy. When the [[Leeward Islands]] were separated from [[Barbados]] in 1671, Nevis became the seat of the [[Leeward Islands Colony]] and was given the nickname "Queen of the Caribees". It remained colonial capital for the Leeward Islands until the seat was transferred to [[Antigua]] for military reasons in 1698. During this period, Nevis was the richest of the British Leeward Islands.<ref name="Hubbard" /> The island outranked even larger islands like [[Jamaica]] in sugar production in the late 17th century. The wealth of the planters on the island is evident in the tax records preserved at the [[Calendar State Papers]] in the British [[Colonial Office]] Public Records, where the amount of tax collected on the Leeward Islands was recorded. The sums recorded for 1676 as  "head tax on slaves", a tax payable in sugar, amounted to 384,600 pounds in Nevis, as opposed to 67,000 each in Antigua and Saint Kitts, 62,500 in [[Montserrat]], and 5,500 total in the other five islands.<ref> ''Calendar State Papers'' (1676). Number 1152, 1676. The British Colonial Office Public Records. Qtd. in Hubbard, p. 85.</ref>  The profits on sugar cultivation in Nevis was enhanced by the fact that the [[sugar cane|cane juice]] from Nevis yielded an unusually high amount of sugar. A gallon (3.79 litres) of cane juice from Nevis yielded 24 ounces (0.71 litres) of sugar, whereas a gallon from Saint Kitts yielded 16 ounces (0.47 litres).<ref name="Hubbard" /> Twenty percent of the [[British Empire]]’s total sugar production in 1700 was derived from Nevisian plantations.<ref>Watts, David (1987). ''The West Indies: Patterns of Development, Culture and Environmental Change Since 1492''. Cambridge University Press, 1987, p. 285.</ref> Exports from West Indian colonies like Nevis were worth more than all the exports from all the mainland [[Thirteen colonies]] of North America combined at the time of the [[American Revolution]].<ref name="Hubbard" /> 

The enslaved families formed the large labour force and were forced to perform the monotonous and dangerous work of the sugar plantations. After the 1650s the supply of white indentured servants began to dry up due to increased wages in England and less incentive to migrate to the colonies. Additionally, the plantation owners considered lifelong enslavement a better long-term investment for their owners than [[indentured servant]]s who could leave after four to seven years. They also considered it easier to control persons in a workforce that had been removed from their homelands and separated from their kin by brute force and who were easily discerned by their skin colour should they try to escape. By the end of the 17th century, the population of Nevis consisted of a small, rich planter elite in control, a marginal population of poor whites, a great majority of enslaved families of African descent, and an unknown number of [[Maroon (people)|maroons]], people who had freed themselves from the exploitation at the plantations and escaped into the mountains. In 1780, 90 percent of the 10,000 people living on Nevis were black.<ref name="Hubbard" /> Some of the maroons joined with the few remaining Caribs in Nevis to form an ever present resistance force in the mountainous regions of the island. Memories of the Nevisian maroons' struggle against the injustices suffered by the Afro-Caribbean population under the plantation system are preserved in place names such as Maroon Hill, an early centre of resistance.

The great wealth generated by the colonies of the West Indies led to wars between Spain, Britain, and France. The formation of the United States can be said to be a partial by-product of these wars and the strategic trade aims that often ignored North America.<ref name="Hubbard" /> Three [[privateers]] were employed by the British Crown to help protect ships in Nevis' waters. One of them, Captain Frances, was of African descent. He commanded 100 men and a 20-gun ship.<ref name="Hubbard"/> 

During the 17th century the French, based on Saint Kitts, launched many attacks on Nevis, sometimes assisted by the Island Caribs, who in 1667 sent a large fleet of canoes along in support. Letters and other records from the era indicate that the English on Nevis hated and feared the Amerindians. In 1674 and 1683 they participated in attacks on Carib villages in [[Dominica]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent]], in spite of a lack of official approval from [[The Crown]] for the attack.<ref name="Hubbard" /> 

On Nevis, the English built [[Fort Charles (Nevis)|Fort Charles]] and a series of smaller fortifications to aid in defending the island against Carib attacks.<ref name="Hubbard" /> 

===Emancipation===
[[Image:Nevis Methodist.jpg|thumb|right|256px|Charlestown Methodist Chapel, 1802. Pro-slavery mobs set the chapel ablaze in 1797, but the building was saved.]]

In 1706, [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], the French Canadian founder of [[Louisiana]] in North America, decided to drive the English out of Nevis and thus also stop pirate attacks on French ships; he considered Nevis the region's headquarter for [[piracy in the Caribbean]] against French trade. During d'Iberville's invasion of Nevis, French [[Buccaneer]]s were used in the front line, infamous for being ruthless killers after the pillaging during the wars with Spain where they gained a reputation for torturing and murdering non-combatants. In the face of the invading force, the English militiamen of Nevis fled. Some planters burned the plantations, rather than letting the French have them, and hid in the mountains. It was the enslaved Africans who held the French at bay by taking up arms to defend their families and the island. The slave quarters had been looted and burned as well, as the main reward promised the men fighting on the French side in the attack was the right to capture as many slaves as possible and resell them in [[Martinique]].

During the fighting, 3,400 enslaved Nevisians were captured and sent off to Martinique, but about 1,000 more, poorly armed and militarily untrained, held the French troops at bay, by "murderous fire" according to an eyewitness account by an English militiaman. He wrote that "the slaves' brave behaviour and defence there shamed what some of their masters did, and they do not shrink to tell us so."<ref name="Hubbard"/> After 18 days of fighting, the French were driven off the island. Among the Nevisian men, women and children carried away on d'Iberville's ships, six ended up in Louisiana, the first persons of African descent to arrive there.<ref name="Hubbard" />

[[Image:JohnPinney.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Slave owner/trader John Pinney (1740-1818) of Montravers Plantation.]]
One consequence of the French attack was a collapsed sugar industry and during the ensuing hardship on Nevis, small plots of land on the plantations were made available to the enslaved families in order to control the loss of life due to starvation. With less profitability for the absentee plantation owners, the import of food supplies for the plantation workers dwindled. Between 1776 and 1783, when the food supplies failed to arrive altogether due to the rebellion in North America, 300-400 enslaved Nevisians starved to death.<ref name="Hubbard" />
On August 1, 1834, slavery was abolished in the British Empire. In Nevis, 8,815 slaves were freed.<ref name="Hubbard" /> The first Monday in August is celebrated as Emancipation Day and is part of the annual Nevis Culturama festival.

A four-year apprenticeship program followed the abolishment of slavery on the plantations. In spite of the continued use of the labour force, the Nevisian slave owners were paid over £150,000 in compensation from the British Government for the loss of property, whereas the enslaved families received nothing for 200 years of labour.<ref>Goveia, Elsa H.

Because of the early distribution of plots and because many of the planters departed from the island when sugar cultivation became unprofitable, a relatively large percentage of Nevisians already owned or controlled land at emancipation.<ref name="Baker">Baker Motley, Constance (1998).

===After 1800===
[[Image:Nevis School1899.jpg|thumb|right|256px| Nevis school in 1899.]]
{{Seealso|History of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

Nevis was united with Saint Kitts and [[Anguilla]] in 1882, and they became an [[associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967, though Anguilla seceded in 1971. Together, Saint Kitts and Nevis became independent on [[September 19]], [[1983]]. On [[August 10]], [[1998]], a referendum on Nevis to separate from Saint Kitts had 2,427 votes in favour and 1,498 against, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed.

Before 1967, the local government of Saint Kitts was also the government of Nevis and Anguilla. Nevis had two seats and Anguilla one seat in the government. The economic and infrastructural development of the two smaller islands was not a priority to the colonial federal government. When the hospital in Charlestown was destroyed in a hurricane in 1899, planting of trees in the squares of Saint Kitts and refurbishing of government buildings, also in Saint Kitts, took precedence over the rebuilding of the only hospital in Nevis.<ref name="Hubbard" /> After five years without any proper medical facilities, the leaders in Nevis initiated a campaign, threatening to seek independence from Saint Kitts. The British Administrator in Saint Kitts, Charles Cox, was unmoved. He stated that Nevis did not need a hospital since there had been no significant rise in the number of deaths during the time Nevisians had been without a hospital. Therefore, no action was needed on behalf of the government, and besides, Cox continued, the Legislative Council regarded "Nevis and Anguilla as a drag on St. Kitts and would willingly see a separation".<ref>Qtd. in Hubbard, p. 195.</ref> Finally, a letter of complaint to the metropolitan [[British Foreign Office]] gave result and the federal government in Saint Kitts was ordered by their superiors in London to take speedy action. The Legislative Council took another five years to consider their options. The final decision by the federal government was to not rebuild the old hospital after all, but to instead convert the old Government House in Nevis into a hospital, named Alexandra Hospital after Queen Alexandra, wife of King [[Edward VII]]. A majority of the funds assigned for the hospital could thus spent on the construction of a new official residence in Nevis.<ref name="Hubbard" /> 

Electricity was introduced in Nevis in 1954, when two generators were shipped in to provide electricity to the area around Charlestown. In this regard, Nevis fared better than Anguilla, where there were no paved roads, no electricity and no telephones in 1967. However, electricity did not become available island-wide on Nevis until 1971.<ref name="Hubbard" />

An ambitious infrastructure development programme has been introduced during the last 10 years, including a transformation of the Charlestown port, construction of a new deep-water harbour, resurfacing and widening the Island Main Road, a new airport terminal and control tower, and a major airport expansion, which required the relocation of an entire village in order to make room for the runway extension. 

Modernized classrooms and better equipped schools, as well as improvements in the educational system, have contributed to a leap in academic performance on the island. The pass rate among the Nevisian students sitting for the [[Caribbean Examination Council]] (CXC) exams, the Cambridge General Certificate of Education Examination (GCE) and the Caribbean Advance Proficiency Examinations is now consistently among the highest in the English-speaking Caribbean.<ref>Brown, Janet (2000).

In addition, Nevis has a constitutionally protected right to secede from the federation, should a two-third majority of the island’s population vote for independence in a local referendum. Section 113.(1) of the constitution states: "The Nevis Island Legislature may provide that the island of Nevis shall cease to be federated with the island of Saint Christopher and accordingly that this Constitution shall no longer have effect in the island of Nevis."<ref>See section 3 and 4 about Nevis Island Legislature and Administration in ''The Saint Christopher and Nevis Constitution Order 1983''.

===Movement for constitutional reform===
[[Joseph Parry]], Premier of Nevis since 2006, has indicated that he favours constitutional reform over secession for Nevis. His party, the NRP, has historically been the strongest and most ardent proponent for Nevis independence; the party came to power with secession as the main campaign issue. In 1975, the NRP manifesto declared that: "The Nevis Reformation Party will strive at all costs to gain secession for Nevis from St. Kitts – a privilege enjoyed by the island of Nevis prior to 1882."<ref> Herbert, Roy (2005).

In ''Handbook of Federal Countries'' published by [[Forum of Federations]], the authors consider the constitution problematic because it does not "specifically outline" the federal financial arrangements or the means by which the central government and Nevis Island Administration can raise revenue: "In terms of the NIA, the constitution only states (in s. 108(1)) that 'all revenues...raised or received by the Administration...shall be paid into and form a fund styled the Nevis Island Consolidated Fund.' [...] Section 110(1) states that the proceeds of all 'takes' collected in St. Kitts and Nevis under any law are to be shared between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration based on population. The share going to the NIA, however, is subject to deductions (s. 110(2)), such as the cost of common services and debt charges, as determined by the Governor-General (s.110(3)) on the advice of the Prime Minister who can also take advice from the Premier of Nevis (s.110(4))."<ref name="Griffiths">Griffiths, Ann Lynn and Karl Nerenberg (2002).

According to a 1995 report by the Commonwealth Observer Group of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], "the federal government is also the local government of St Kitts and this has resulted in a perception among the political parties in Nevis that the interests of the people of Nevis are being neglected by the federal government which is more concerned with the administration of St Kitts than with the federal administration."<ref>''General Election in St Kitts and Nevis 3 July 1995: The Report of the Commonwealth Observer Group''.

'''Legislative motivation for secession'''
[[Image:Nevis Today.jpg|thumb|175px|Nevis Today [http://www.nevisindependence.com/nevistoday.htm], a magazine published by the Nevis Island Administration, is part of the new drive to keep the population updated about investments and plans for the island.]]

In 1996, four new bills were introduced in the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, one of which made provisions to have revenue derived from activities in Nevis paid directly to the treasury in Saint Kitts instead of to the treasury in Nevis. Another bill, The Financial Services Committee Act, contained provisions that all investments in Saint Kitts and Nevis would require approval by an investment committee in Saint Kitts. This was controversial, because ever since 1983 the Nevis Island Administration had approved all investments for Nevis, on the basis that the constitution vests legislative authority for industries, trades and businesses and economic development in Nevis to the Nevis Island Administration.<ref name="Phillips">Phillips, Fred (2002). Commonwealth Caribbean Constitutional Law. Cavendish Publishing, 2002, ISBN 1843144298.</ref> 

All three representatives from Nevis, including the leader of the opposition in the Nevis Island Assembly, objected to the introduction of these bills into the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, arguing that the bills would affect the ability of Nevis to develop its offshore financial services sector and that the bills would be detrimental to the Nevis economy. All the representatives in opposition in the National Assembly shared the conviction that the bills, if passed into law, would be unconstitutional and undermine the constitutional and legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration, as well as result in the destruction of the economy of Nevis.<ref name="CCM"/>

The constitutional crisis initially developed when the newly appointed Attorney General refused to grant permission for the Nevis Island Administration to assert its legal right in the Courts. After a decision of the High Court in favour of the Nevis Island Administration, the Prime Minister gave newspaper interviews stating that he "refused to accept the decision of the High Court".<ref>''St. Kitts and Nevis Observer'' July 16-22, 1995. Qtd. in The Concerned Citizens Movement. "The Way Forward For The Island Of Nevis." ''Nevis, Queen of the Caribees''. Nevis Island Administration, September 1996.]</ref> Due to the deteriorating relationship between the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government, a Constitutional Committee was appointed in April 1996 to advise on whether or not the present constitutional arrangement between the islands should continue. The committee recommended constitutional reform and the establishment of an island administration for Saint Kitts, separate from the Federal Government.<ref name="Phillips" /> 

The Federal Government in Saint Kitts fills both functions today and Saint Kitts does not have an equivalent to the Nevis Island Administration. Disagreements between the political parties in Nevis and between the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government have prevented the recommendations by the electoral committee from being implemented. The problematic political arrangement between the two islands therefore continues to date.<ref name="Griffiths" />

Nevis has continued developing its own legislation, such as The Nevis International Insurance Ordinance and the Nevis International Mutual Funds Ordinance of 2004,<ref name="Finance">As reported by the Premier at the official Web site for [http://www.nevisfinance.com/About.cfm?Idz=1 Nevis Financial Services Departments and the Ministry of Finance, Nevis]. Retrieved 8 Aug. 2006.</ref> but calls for secession are often based on concerns that the legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration might be challenged again in the future.

'''Fiscal motivation for secession'''

The issues of political dissension between Saint Kitts and Nevis are often centered around perceptions of imbalance in the economic structure.<ref>Anckar, Dag (2001).

''Tourism in the Caribbean: Trends, Development, Prospects''. Routledge, 2004. ISBN 0415303613, p. 102: "Nevis has claimed domination and exploitation by St Kitts and has come to view St Kitts as the 'larger omnipresent looming partner' (Premdas 2000). Such mistreatment (whether real or perceived), combined with the subordinate island's distinctive cultural and historical identity, has fostered an ambivalent relationship between internal core and periphery. These accusations and counter-attacks have been entrenched in the countries' collective memory and have, to some degree, permeated many aspects of society." See also: Phillips, Fred (2002). ''Commonwealth Caribbean Constitutional Law'' Cavendish Publishing, 2002.

==Parishes==
{{main|Parishes of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
The island of Nevis is divided into five administrative subdivisions called [[parish]]es. Each parish has an elected representative in the Nevis Island Assembly. The division of the almost round island has been done in a [[circular sector]] pattern, with each parish shaped like a pie slice, reaching from the tip of Nevis peak to the coastline.

The parishes have double names, for example [[Saint George Gingerland]], where the first part of the name is the name of the [[patron saint]] of the parish church. The second part is the common name of the parish. Often the parishes are referred to simply by their common name. The religious part of a parish name is sometimes written or pronounced in the possessive: Saint George's Gingerland. 

The five parishes of Nevis are:

* [[Saint George Gingerland]]
* [[Saint James Windward]]
* [[Saint John Figtree]]
* [[Saint Paul Charlestown]]
* [[Saint Thomas Lowland]]

The formation of the island began in [[pliocene|mid-Pliocene]] times, approximately 3.45 million years ago. Nine distinct eruptive centres from different geological ages, ranging from mid-Pliocene to [[Pleistocene]], have contributed to the formation. No single model of the island's [[Geochronology|geological evolution]] can therefore be ascertained.<ref>United Nations (2000). "Saint Kitts and Nevis: Executive Summary". ''Country Reports''. Committee on Science and Technology, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, [http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/lac/national/2000/saint_kitts_and_nevis-summary-eng.pdf pdf file], retrieved 7 Dec. 2006.</ref> 

Nevis Peak (985 m /3,232 ft) is the dormant remnant of one of these ancient [[stratovolcano]]es. The last activity took place in 1692, but active [[fumaroles]] and hot springs are still found on the island, the most recent formed in 1953.<ref>[http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1600-04= "Nevis Peak"] (2006). ''Global Worldwide Holocene Volcano and Eruption Information''. Global Volcanism Program, Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, 2006. Retrieved 8 Aug. 2006.</ref>  The composite cone of Nevis volcano has two overlapping summit craters that are partially filled by a lava dome, created in recent, pre-Columbian time. [[Pyroclastic flows]] and mudflows were deposited on the lower slopes of the cone simultaneously. Nevis Peak is located on the outer crater rim. Four other lava domes were constructed on the flanks of the volcano, one on the northeast flank (Madden's Mount), one on the eastern flank (Butlers Mountain), one on the northwest coast (Mount Lily) and one on the south coast (Saddle Hill).

During the last [[Ice age]] when the sea level was 200 feet lower, the three islands of Saint Kitts, Nevis and [[Saint Eustatius]] (also known as Statia) were connected as one island. [[Saba]] however is separated from these three by a deeper channel. 

The most popular and most developed beach is the 4-mile (6.44 km) long Pinney's Beach, on the western or [[Caribbean]] coast. The eastern coast of the island faces into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and can have strong surf in parts of the shore which are unprotected by fringing [[coral reef]]s. The colour of the [[sand]] on the beaches of Nevis is variable: on a lot of the bigger beaches the sand is a yellowish grey, but some beaches on the southern coast have darker, reddish, or even black sand. Under a microscope it becomes clear that Nevis sand is a mixture of tiny fragments of coral, many [[foraminifera]], and small crystals of the various mineral constituents of the [[volcanic rock]] of which the island is made. 

=== Colonial deforestation ===
[[Image:Nevis-lookingtosea.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Looking out to sea on Nevis]]

During the 17th and 18th centuries, massive [[deforestation]] was undertaken by the planters as the land was initially cleared for sugar cultivation. Eventually the sugarcane fields stretched from the coast to the upper regions of the mountain slope in many areas. This intense land exploitation by the sugar and cotton industry, lasting almost 300 years, led to irreparable damage to the island’s original [[ecosystem]]. In some places along the windswept southeast or "Windward" coast of the island, the landscape is radically altered compared with how it used to be in pre-colonial times.<ref name="Wilson" /> Due to extreme land erosion, the top soil was swept away, and in some places at the coast, sheer cliffs as high as 25 metres (82 feet) have developed. <ref>Wilson, Samuel (1990). "The Prehistoric Settlement Pattern of Nevis, West Indies". ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 16, No. 4  (Winter 1989), p. 428: "The breakup of the fringing reef has itself contributed to extensive and accelerating coastal erosion on the windward coast of the island, where sea cliffs of unconsolidated volcanic gravels as high as 25 m have developed."</ref>

The lush primeval forest, which once covered the eastern coastal plain where the Amerindians built their first settlements during the Aceramic period, is gone forever, and so is a large portion of the ecosystem surrounding the [[coral reef]] just offshore. It was the easy access to fresh water on the island and the rich food source represented by the ocean life sheltered by the reef that made it feasible for the Amerindians to settle this area around 600 BCE.<ref name="Wilson" /> With the loss of the natural vegetation, the balance in runoff nutrients to the reef was disturbed, eventually causing as much as 80 percent of the large eastern fringing reef to become inactive. As the reef broke apart, it in turn provided less protection for the coastline.<ref name="Wilson" /> 

During times of maximum cultivation, sugar cane fields stretched from the coastline of Nevis up to an altitude where the mountain slopes were too steep and rocky to farm. Nonetheless, once the sugar industry was finally abandoned, vegetation on the leeward side of the island regrew reasonably well as scrub and secondary forest.

===Water resources===
Nevis has several natural fresh water springs, as well as non-potable volcanic [[hot spring]]s. After heavy rains, strong rivers of water pour down the numerous [[ravine]]s (known as Ghauts), and the coastal ponds, both freshwater and brackish, fill to capacity and beyond, spilling over into the sea. However, with modern development on the island, this is no longer enough to supply freshwater to the whole island. The water supply now comes mostly from Government wells.

The major source of potable water for the island is groundwater, obtained from 14 active wells. Water is pumped from the wells, stored and allowed to flow by gravity to the various locations. <ref name=”ECLAC”> The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).

In Programme of Action for the sustainable development of small island developing States (SIDS POA). United Nations, 2003-09-29. Retrieved 28 August 2007.</ref>

===Climate===
The climate is tropical with little variation, tempered from December through February by the steady, mild north-easterly breezes called the alizés or [[trade wind]]s, followed by a slightly hotter and somewhat rainier season from May to November. Nevis lies in the track of tropical hurricanes, developing between August and October. This period has the heaviest rainfall of the year. In 1999, Nevis was hit by [[hurricane Lenny]], the most recent hurricane to cause heavy damage to the island's infrastructure.
 
==Culture==

''Culturama'', the annual cultural festival of Nevis, is celebrated during the Emancipation Day weekend, the first week of August. The festivities include many traditional folk dances, such as the [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]], the [[Moko jumbies]] on stilts, Cowboys and Indians, and Plait the Ribbon, a [[May pole]] dance. The celebration was given a more organized form in 1974, including a Miss Culture Show and a [[Calypso]] Competition, as well as drama performances, old fashion Troupes (including Johnny Walkers, Giant and Spear, Bulls, Red Cross and Blue Ribbon), arts and crafts exhibitions and recipe competitions. According to the Nevis Department of Culture, the aim is to protect and encourage indigenous folklore, in order to make sure that the uniquely Caribbean culture can "reassert itself and flourish".<ref>Nevis Department of Culture (2006).

===Music, theater and dance===
Nevisian culture has since the 1600s incorporated African, European and East Indian cultural elements, creating a distinct Afro-Caribbean culture. Several historical anthropologists have done field research Nevis and in Nevisian [[migrant]] communities in order to trace the creation and constitution of a Nevisian cultural community. Karen Fog Olwig published her research about Nevis in 1993, writing that the areas where the Afro-Caribbean traditions were especially strong and flourishing relate to [[kinship]] and [[subsistence farming]]. However, she adds, Afro-Caribbean cultural impulses were not recognized or valued in the colonial society and were therefore often expressed through Euro-Caribbean cultural forms.<ref>Olwig, Karen Fog (1993). ''Global Culture, Island Identity: continuity and change in the Afro-Caribbean community of Nevis''. Chur, Switzerland: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1993.</ref> Examples of European forms appropriated to express Afro-Caribbean culture are the Nevisian and Kittitian ''Tea Meetings'' and ''Christmas Sports''. According to anthropologist [[Roger D. Abrahams]], these traditional performance art forms are "Nevisian approximation of British performance codes, techniques, and patterns". He writes that the Tea Meetings were staged as theatrical "battles between decorum and chaos", [[decorum]] represented by the ceremony chairmen and chaos the hecklers in the audience, with a diplomatic King or a Queen presiding over the battle to ensure fairness.<ref>Abrahams, Roger D. (1983). ''Man of Words in the West Indies: Performance and the Emergence of Creole Culture''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins U P, 1983.</ref> 

The Christmas Sports included a form of comedy and satire based on local events and gossip.<ref name="Abrahams1" /> They were historically an important part of the Christmas celebrations in Nevis, performed on Christmas Eve by small troupes consisting of five or six men accompanied by string bands from different parts of the island. One of the men in the troupe was dressed as a woman, playing all the female parts in the dramatizations. The troupes moved from yard to yard to perform their skits, using props, face paint and costumes to play the roles of well-known personalities in the community. Examples of gossip about undesired behaviour that could surface in the skits for comic effect were querulous neighbours, adulterous affairs, planters mistreating workers, domestic disputes or abuse, crooked politicians and any form of stealing or cheating experienced in the society. Even though no names were mentioned in these skits, the audience would usually be able to guess who the heckling message in the troupe’s dramatized portrayals was aimed at, as it was played out right on the concerned person’s own front yard. The acts thus functioned as social and moral commentaries on current events and behaviours in the Nevisian society. Abrahams theorises that Christmas Sports are rooted in the pre-emancipation Christmas and New Year holiday celebrations when the enslaved population had several days off.<ref name="Abrahams1">Abrahams, Roger D. (1973). "Christmas Mummings on Nevis." North Carolina Folklore Journal (1973): pp. 120-31.</ref>

==Architecture==
[[Image:Nevis Hamilton.jpg|thumb|left|The Museum of Nevis History, Charlestown, housed in the restored Georgian building where [[Alexander Hamilton]] was born.]] A series of earthquakes during the 18th century laid most of the colonial era stone buildings of Charlestown in ruins. The [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] stone buildings of today had to be partially rebuilt after the earthquakes, and this led to the development of a new architectural style, consisting of wooden upper floors over a ground floor built of stone; the new style resisted earthquake damage more effectively.

Two famous Nevisian buildings from the 18th century are Hermitage Plantation, built of [[lignum vitae]] wood in 1740, the oldest surviving wooden house still in use in the Caribbean today, and the [[Bath Hotel, Nevis|Bath Hotel]], the first hotel in the Caribbean, a luxury hotel and spa built by John Huggins in 1778. The soothing waters of the hotel's [[hot spring]] and the lively social life on Nevis attracted many famous Europeans, including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. Antigua-based [[Admiral Nelson]] and Prince William Henry, [[Duke of Clarence]], (future [[William IV of the United Kingdom]]), who attended balls and private parties at the Bath Hotel. Today, the building serves as government offices, and there is a simple, shaded, outdoor hot-spring bathing spot for public use.

An often repeated legend recounts how a massive 1690 earthquake and [[tsunami]] destroyed the buildings of the original capital Jamestown, a town on the west coast. However, recent research has found no archaeological evidence that would indicate that the story is true. Archaeologists from the [[University of Southampton]] who have done excavations in the area state that the myth may be the result of an over-excited Victorian letter writer who shared somewhat exaggerated accounts of his exotic life in the tropical colony with a British audience back home.<ref>Machling, Tessa (2002). "Jamestown, Morton's Bay and James Fort: Myth, Port and Fort". ''Interim Report for the 2002 Season, Theme Two.'' University of Southampton. Available online in pdf format.

Retrieved 8 Aug. 2006.</ref> One such letter recounts that so much damage was done to the town that it had to be completely abandoned, and that the whole town sank into the sea, but most of this story appears to be legend only. Early maps do not, however, actually show a "Jamestown", only "Morton's Bay", and later maps show that all that was left of the town Jamestown/Morton's Bay in 1818 was a building labelled "Pleasure House". Very old bricks that wash up on Pinney's Beach after storms may have contributed to the idea of a sunken town; however these bricks are thought to be dumped ballast from 17th and 18th century sailing ships.
