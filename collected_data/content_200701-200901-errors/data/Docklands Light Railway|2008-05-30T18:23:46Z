The '''Docklands Light Railway''' ('''DLR''') is a [[light rail]] system serving the redeveloped [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area of [[East London, England]]. It opened on [[August 31]] [[1987]] and after extensions reaches north to [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], south to [[Lewisham]], west to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] in the [[City of London]] financial district, and east to [[Beckton]] and [[North Woolwich]]. DLR track and trains are not compatible with those of [[London Underground]], but the two systems share a ticketing system and the DLR is shown on the [[London Underground]] [[Tube map]]. 

The trains are computer-controlled and normally have no driver: a Passenger Service Agent (PSA) <ref>{{cite web

PSAs can also take control of the train in certain circumstances including equipment failure and emergencies. Stations are generally unstaffed except those below ground, which are required to be staffed in case evacuation is needed.

The DLR has been operated and maintained by a franchisee since [[1997]]. The current franchise, due to expire in [[April]] [[2013]], is held by Serco Docklands Ltd., a company  formed jointly by [[Serco]] and the former DLR management team.

The DLR system has 39 stations and is expanding. In [[2006]] it carried over 60 million passengers.<ref>Transport for London (2007) [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4825.aspx Docklands Light Railway carries 60 million passengers] Retrieved [[April 5]], [[2007]]</ref> The Docklands Light Railway was 20 years old on [[31 August]] [[2007]]<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Transport for London |date=2007-08-07 |url=http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=144 |title=DLR 20th anniversary competition winners to get inside track |accessdate=2008-02-23 }}</ref>.

==History==
The docks east of London began to decline in the early [[1960]]s as international freight became containerised. The opening of the [[Tilbury]] container docks, further east in [[Essex]], rendered the old docks redundant and in [[1980]] control of them passed to the British government.
[[Image:DLR tower gateway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tower Gateway station was the DLR’s original link to central London.]]
The [[Jubilee Line]] of the [[London Underground]] had opened in [[1979]] from [[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore]] to [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]], intended as the first stage of a cross-town tube line beyond Charing Cross to various places in south-east [[London]]. 
Although land, for example at [[Ludgate Circus]] and at [[Lewisham]], had been reserved for the second stage, the rising cost for that [[Jubilee Line extension]] led in the early [[1980]]s to the project's indefinite postponement.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=London Docklands Development Corporation |title= Various route options for the London Underground dating from the 1960s to 1980s  |url= http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran1.jpg |accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>

The [[London Docklands Development Corporation]], needing to provide public transport cheaply for the former docks area to stimulate regeneration, chose a light-rail scheme using still existing docks railway infrastructure to link the [[West India Docks]] to [[Tower Hill]] and to a northern terminus, for which [[Stratford station]], using a track alongside the Great Eastern lines out of London, was preferred over [[Mile End tube station|Mile End]] where the need for tram-like street-running was at variance with the plan to have a fully automated railway. At Stratford a disused bay platform at the west of the station was advantageous and there was interchange with the [[Central Line]] and main lines. The growth brought to [[Docklands]] later enabled the [[Jubilee Line]] to be extended in [[1999]] to [[East London]], by a more southerly route than originally proposed, through Surrey Quays/Docks, [[Canary Wharf]], the Greenwich peninsula (which was the next regeneration area) to Stratford.<br /> 
The initial system, costing only £77 million, from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] and from [[Stratford station|Stratford]] to [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]] was opened by Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. 

=== Initial system ===
The initial system was constructed by [[Balfour Beatty]] between [[1985]] and [[1987]].<ref name="DLRhandbook">Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook, Stephen Jolly and Bob Bayman (1986) ISBN 0 904711 80 3</ref>

As originally conceived, the system was to be entirely above ground and comprise three branches, with their termini at [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]], [[Stratford station|Stratford]] and [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]]. Most of the track was elevated, either on new lightweight concrete viaducts or on disused railway viaducts, with some use of disused surface-level railway right of way. 

The system was lightweight, with stations and trains only a single articulated vehicle long. The three branches together totalled 13 [[Kilometre|km]],<ref name="facts">Docklands Light Railway (2005). ''[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/dlr/about/facts.shtml Facts]'', with 13 stations. Retrieved [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref> were connected by a flat triangular junction near [[Poplar]]. Services ran Tower Gateway-Island Gardens and Stratford-Island Gardens, meaning that the north side of the junction was not used in regular passenger service.

The stations on the initial system were mostly to a common design and were constructed out of a standard set of parts.  The principal distinguishing feature of the stations was a relatively short half cylindrical glazed blue canopy to provide shelter from the rain.

===First extensions===
[[Image:Tower Gateway DLR station 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The view from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] looking east shows [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] approach tracks to the left, the original DLR line in the centre, and DLR train emerging from the tunnel to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] to the right]]

The initial system proved to have insufficient capacity as the Docklands area developed into a major financial centre and employment zone. Additionally, the Tower Gateway terminus, situated at the very edge of the [[City of London]], attracted criticism for its poor connections.

In response to this, all stations and trains were extended to two-unit lengths, and the system was extended into the heart of the City of London with a tunnel to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank underground station]], which opened in 1991. This extension diverged from the initial western branch, leaving [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway station]] on a limb. It also rendered the initial car fleet obsolete, as its construction was not suitable for use underground ''(see the [[#Rolling Stock|Rolling Stock]] section, below, and the main article [[Docklands Light Railway rolling stock]])''.

At the same time, the areas in the east of [[London Docklands|Docklands]] needed better transport connections to encourage development. This resulted in a fourth branch being constructed, from [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] via [[Canning Town station|Canning Town transport interchange]] to [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]], running along the north side of the Royal Docks complex. Early designs showed several options through the Blackwall Area <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran15.jpg |title=Options for the DLR Beckton Extension route |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref>. As part of this extension, one side of the original flat triangular junction was replaced with a [[grade separation|grade-separated]] junction west of Poplar, and a new grade-separated junction was created at the divergence of the Stratford and Beckton lines east of Poplar. Poplar station was rebuilt to provide cross-platform interchange between the Stratford and Beckton lines.

The growth of the [[Canary Wharf]] office complex required the redevelopment of [[Canary Wharf DLR station]] from a small wayside station to a large complex with six platforms serving three tracks, beneath a large overall roof and fully integrated into the malls below the office towers. The original DLR station was never completed and was, in fact, dismantled before the line officially opened.  The automatically-operated trains continued to stop at this location.

===Second stage extensions=== 
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:MG 8236.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Blackwall DLR Station with Canary Wharf in the background]] -->
Early in the days of the DLR's operation, the [[London Borough of Lewisham]] commissioned a feasibility study of extending the DLR under the Thames to Lewisham.  The outcome of the study led the South London borough to push the case for an extension, and eventually a line to [[Greenwich]], [[Deptford]] and Lewisham joined the roster of extensions.

The line was planned to leave the original DLR route south of Crossharbour turn-back sidings, dropping gently to Mudchute, a street level station replacing the high-level Mudchute on the former London & Blackwall viaduct.  Immediately after, the line would drop into tunnel, tracing the route of the viaduct to Island Gardens, a just-below-surface station reached by a staircase.  Crossing the Thames, the line would have a station in the centre of Greenwich, thereafter rising to the surface in deep tunnel and then cut-and-cover to a stop at the mainline [[Greenwich station]], the southbound DLR track offering convenient cross-platform interchange with the city-bound mainline.  From here, the line would snake across concrete viaducts to Deptford, Elverson Road (at street level on a road close to Lewisham town centre), terminating in two platforms lying directly under the mainline platforms at Lewisham, in walking distance of the town shopping centre, and bus services stopping directly outside the station.

The Lewisham extension, authorised as above, opened in 1999. With the opening of the extension, DLR took its first steps from being a local people-mover to a truly important backbone of the east/south-east London transport system.  

On [[2 December]] [[2005]], a new eastward branch, running along the southern side of the [[Royal Docks]] complex, opened from Canning Town to [[King George V DLR station|King George V]], via [[London City Airport DLR station|London City Airport]].  Further extension to Woolwich, already being shown on London tube maps, and to be built at or close to the future stop on the [[Crossrail]] line to Abbey Wood via West India and Royal Docks, will contribute to this growth.

==Current system== 
[[Image:dlr.canary.wharf.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Docklands Light Railway train enters [[Canary Wharf]] from the south.]]

The DLR now includes routes extending for a total of 31 [[Kilometre|km]].<ref name="facts">Docklands Light Railway (2005). ''[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/dlr/1538.aspx]''. Retrieved [[April 16]], [[2007]].</ref> There are five branches: to [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]] in the south, [[Stratford station|Stratford]] in the north, [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]] and [[King George V DLR station|King George V]] in the east, and to Central London, splitting to serve [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] and [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]]. Although the system allows many different combinations of routes, at present the following four are operated in normal service:

* Stratford to Lewisham
* Bank to Lewisham
* Bank to King George V
* Tower Gateway to Beckton

Trains during peak times on the Stratford line turn back at [[Crossharbour and London Arena DLR station|Crossharbour]] rather than continuing to Lewisham. There are also occasional trains from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] to Crossharbour and [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]]. There are no [[limited-stop]] trains on the DLR: every train serves every station on its route.

The northern and southern branches terminate at the National Rail (main line) stations at Stratford and Lewisham. Other direct interchanges between the DLR and National Rail are at [[Limehouse station|Limehouse]] and Greenwich.

===Stations===
[[Image:DLR Westferry aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|An eastbound train leaving Westferry Station.]]
Many DLR stations are elevated, with others at street level, in a cutting, or underground. Access to the platforms is normally by staircase, very few stations having escalators. The DLR network from the outset has been fully accessible to wheelchairs. The stations have high platforms, matching the floor height of the cars, allowing easy access to the trains for passengers with wheelchairs or pushchairs.

Most of the stations are of a modular design dating back to the initial system, albeit extended and improved over the years. This design has two side platforms, each with separate access from the street, and platform canopies with a distinctive rounded roof design. Most stations are unstaffed, although for safety reasons the three stations below ground, [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]], and [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark]], are staffed, as are a few of the busier interchange stations.

See [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations]] for stations on the system.

===DLR Art===
On the [[3 July]] [[2007]], DLR officially launched <ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Transport for London |date=2007-07-03 |url=http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=139 |title= Docklands Light Railway draws up public arts strategy |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> their own [http://www.dlrart.co.uk/ art programme] similar to that in place on the [[London Underground]], [[Platform for Art]]. Alan Williams was appointed to produce Docklands Light Railway's first temporary commission. Known as "sidetrack" the project portrays the ordinary and extraordinary sights, often unfamiliar to passengers, along the route of the Docklands Light Railway and was displayed throughout the network.

===Fares and ticketing===
Ticketing is part of the London Fare zone system, and [[Travelcard]]s that cover the correct zones are valid. 

There are also one-day and season DLR-only "Rover" tickets available, plus a one-day DLR "Rail and River Rover" ticket for use on the DLR and on City Cruises river boats. Oyster Pre-Pay is also available on the DLR &mdash; passengers need to both touch in and touch out their [[Oyster card]]s on the readers at the entrance / exit to the platforms, or pass through the automatic gates at selected stations.

Tickets must be purchased from ticket machines at the entrance to the platforms, and are required before the passenger enters the platform. There are no ticket barriers in DLR-only stations, and correct ticketing is enforced by on-train checks by the Passenger Service Agent. Exceptions to this rule are [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] and [[Stratford station|Stratford]] stations, where the DLR platforms are located within the barrier lines of a [[London Underground]] or [[National Rail]] station.

The DLR is used by up to a hundred thousand people daily, with around 60 million journeys yearly.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Transport for London |date=2007-04-04 |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4825.aspx |title=Docklands Light Railway carries 60 million passengers |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref>

==Accidents and incidents==
===Overrun of station buffers===
Prior to the public opening of the railway, on [[10 March]] [[1987]], a train crashed through station [[buffer stop]]s at the original high-level terminus [[Island Gardens]] station and was left hanging from the end of the elevated track. The accident was caused by unauthorised tests being run before accident-preventing modifications had been installed. The train was being driven manually at the time.<ref name=Risks1>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.29.html#subj3 London Docklands Light Railway; Northern Line's Dot-Matrix Indicators] [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 29 Article 3, [[13 Aug]] 1987</ref><ref name=ModernRailways1>Report on the Docklands Light Railway Accident Which Occurred at Island Gardens Station on [[10 March]] [[1987]], ''[[Modern Railways]]'', May 1987</ref><ref name=ModernRailways2>"'Unauthorised Tests' Caused DLR Crash", ''[[Modern Railways]]'', June 1987</ref>

===Service difficulties with the Royal train===
In July 1987, a series of minor incidents marred the operation of the royal train (number E2R) carrying [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as part of the ceremonies marking the opening of the line.  The train had been manually dispatched from its starting point at Island Gardens station five minutes early because of the early arrival of the royal party.  The train was on automatic control and so, being ahead of schedule, was held at the next station (Mudchute) for a few minutes before the driver reverted to manual control "to speed the Royal passage" and continued on to Poplar station, where the royal party were to disembark.  At the station, a member of the royal security detail used the emergency exit to leave the train ahead of the Queen before it had fully stopped.  This caused the train to make an emergency stop in the station, short of its normal position and out of range of the docking beacon that marked its arrival point. The train doors would not open, impeding the Queen's exit for several minutes.<ref name=Risks2>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.23.html#subj4.1 Railway automation], Stephen Colwill, [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 23 Article 4, [[31 Jul]] 1987</ref><ref name=Risks3>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.52.html#subj2.1 Computer's Normal Operation Delays Royal Visit], Mark Brader, [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 52 Article 2, [[29 Oct]] 1987</ref><ref name=ModernRailways3>"Opening of the Docklands Light Railway," Roger Ford, ''[[Modern Railways]]'', September 1987</ref>

===Collision at West India Quay bridge===
On [[22 April]] [[1991]], two trains collided at a junction on the [[West India Quay]] bridge during morning [[rush hour]], requiring a shutdown of the entire system and evacuation of the involved passengers by ladder.<ref name=Risks5>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/11.52.html#subj1.1 Another commuter train wreck in London], Jonathan I.

===South Quay bombing===
{{Main|1996 Docklands bombing}} 
The Docklands Light Railway has also been the scene of a terrorist attack. On [[9 February]] [[1996]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] exploded a [[lorry]] under a bridge near [[South Quay DLR station]], killing 2 people and injuring many others. This number would have been higher if not for advance warning. The blast did £85 million damage and marked an end to the IRA ceasefire.  Significant disruption was caused to DLR services, and a train was left stranded at Island Gardens station, unable to move until the track was rebuilt.

==Rolling stock==
[[Image:Dlr emu at tower gateway.jpg|thumb|left|A DLR train is headed by B2K stock car 96, shown at [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway station]]]]

{{Main|Docklands Light Railway rolling stock}}

The DLR is operated by high-floor, bi-directional, single-articulated cars with four doors on each side, each train consisting of two cars. The cars have no driver’s cab, although there is a small driver’s console concealed behind a locked panel at each car end from which the Passenger Service Agent (PSA) can drive the car when necessary. Other consoles at each door opening allow the PSA to control door closure and make announcements whilst patrolling the train. Because of the absence of a driver’s position, the fully-glazed car ends provide an unusual forward (or rear) view for passengers. The current stock has a top speed of 50 mph (80 km/hour).

Despite having high floors and being highly automated, the cars are derived from a [[Germany|German]] [[light rail|light-rail]] design intended for use in systems with elements of street running. All the cars that have operated on the system to date look similar, but there have been several different types, some still in service and others sold to other operators. A further car type, with quite different styling, is to be introduced in 2007.
{{clear}}

==Signalling technology==
Originally, the DLR used [[Railway signalling|signalling]] based on a [[Railway signalling#Fixed block|fixed-block]] technology developed by [[General Electric Company plc|GEC-General Signal]] and [[General Railway Signal]].<ref name="DLRhandbook"/> This was replaced in 1994 with a [[Railway signalling#Moving block|moving-block]] system developed by [[Alcatel]], called [[SelTrac]].The SelTrac system was bought by [[Thales Group|Thales]] in 2007 and current updates are being provided by Thales Signalling Solutions. The same technology is used for some other [[rapid transit]] systems, including Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]],Toronto's SRT, San Francisco's Municipal Railway ([[MUNI]]) and [[Hong Kong]]'s MTR. Transmissions occur between each train's onboard computer and the control centre at Poplar. If this link is broken, the train stops until it is authorised to move again. If the whole system fails the train can run at only 20 km/h for safety until the system is restored. Also, emergency brakes can be applied if the train breaks the speed limit during manual control, or if the train leaves the station when the route has not been set.<ref> Railway Technology (2006) [http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/ Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Extensions, London, United Kingdom] Retrieved [[23 November]] [[2006]] </ref>

==Recent developments==
===New platforms at Stratford===
:'''''Status''' - both platforms have opened''
[[Image:Stratford DLR 4a 4b e.JPG|thumb|right|New platforms 4a and 4b at Stratford]]
The DLR originally only had one narrow two-car platform at [[Stratford station|Stratford]], which limited capacity and hindered interchange with other services at the station. This closed on [[15 June]] [[2007]] and has been replaced by two new three-car platforms: the first new platform opened on [[18 June]] [[2007]]<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/5317.aspx Press release on opening first new platform at Stratford]</ref> and the second opened on [[9 December]] [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/6816.aspx New Docklands Light Railway station opens at Langdon Park]</ref>

===Langdon Park station===
:'''''Status''' - Opened'' 

A station at [[Langdon Park DLR station|Langdon Park]] in-between [[All Saints DLR station|All Saints]] and [[Devons Road DLR station|Devons Road]] stations opened on [[December 9]] [[2007]] <ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/6816.aspx New Docklands Light Railway station opens at Langdon Park]</ref>.

==Future developments==
With the development of the eastern Docklands as part of the ‘[[Thames Gateway]]’ initiative and London’s successful bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], several extensions and enhancements are under construction, being planned or being discussed:<ref name="dlrdev">Docklands Light Railway (2005). ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/index.asp DLR Development Projects]'' Retrieved [[February 23]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Woolwich Arsenal extension===
:'''''Status''' - Under Construction''

This will extend the [[London City Airport]] branch from [[King George V DLR station|King George V]] to [[Woolwich Arsenal railway station|Woolwich Arsenal]] and is due to open on [[28 February]] [[2009]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=Games transport legacy put in place as Mayor unveils new Docklands Light Railway carriages |publisher=Transport for London |date=2008-03-13 |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/7723.aspx |accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref>. The projected cost of £150 million, due to a required second DLR tunnel crossing of the [[River Thames]], is being met by [[Private Finance Initiative]] funding. Construction began in June 2005, and the tunnel was completed on [[23 July]] [[2007]].<ref>[http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=141 Tunnel extending Docklands Light Railway to Woolwich completed] </ref>

===Upgrading Bank - Lewisham route to 3-car trains===
:'''''Status''' - Under Construction''

The stations between [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] and [[Lewisham]] will be upgraded to allow operation of 3-car trains to increase capacity. More frequent trains were considered as an alternative, but it was found that the necessary signalling changes would be as expensive as upgrading to handle longer trains but would provide fewer benefits.<ref name="dlrcapen">Docklands Light Railway. (2005). ''[http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/dlr_capacity/index.shtml DLR Capacity Enhancement]''. Retrieved [[February 26]], [[2006]].</ref> 

The work involves the lengthening of platforms at most above-ground stations together with viaduct-strengthening works to support the additional weight of lengthened trains, as much of this section dates from the initial system originally built for single-car operation.

[[South Quay DLR station|South Quay station]] will be rebuilt to the east as nearby curves preclude lengthening.  [[Mudchute DLR station|Mudchute]] will gain a third platform and all the platforms there will have a full-length canopy<ref>[http://londonconnections.blogspot.com/2008/04/mudchute-third-platform.html London Connections blog on work at Mudchute]</ref>.  However, due to the cost and the risk to nearby historic buildings, the underground [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark station]] will not be extended, but use of [[Selective Door Operation]] (SDO) has been approved by the [[Railway Inspectorate]] at this station instead.

The £200m works contract was awarded on 3 May 2007 <ref>[http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=133 Extra carriage on every DLR train]</ref>. The work is to be carried out during 2007-2009. Some work has already started resulting in partial weekend closures and a large portion of the work will be carried out in 2008 in concentrated periods of activity.

====Other stations affected====
Although not on the Bank – Lewisham route, two other stations are included in the plans so as to improve operational flexibility. [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar station]] has already been lengthened in advance of the work elsewhere to confirm that the proposed method of construction is satisfactory. To enable use by 3-car trains, [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] will be converted from its current two-track terminal layout to a single line served by two platforms; the southern access for departures, the northern for arrivals <ref>[http://www.planning.cityoflondon.gov.uk:90/WAM/doc/Drawing-78475.pdf?extension=.pdf&wmTransparency=0&id=78475&wmLocation=0&location=livevolume1&contentType=application%2Fpdf&wmName=&pageCount=1 Plans submitted to the City of London]</ref>. It will be closed from 28 June 2008 until April 2009 to enable the work to be carried out.

===Stratford International extension / North London Line conversion===
:'''''Status''' - Under Construction''

An extension is currently being built from Canning Town to the new [[Stratford International station]].  This takes over part of the closed section of the [[North London Line]] infrastructure and will link the Docklands area with domestic and international high-speed services on [[High Speed 1]]. It is projected to open early in 2010 and is an important part of the transport improvement package for the [[2012 Olympic Games]], which will largely be held on a site adjoining Stratford International.

Four new stations will be built: [[Star Lane DLR station|Star Lane]] (formerly known as Cody Road), [[Abbey Road DLR station|Abbey Road]], [[Stratford High Street DLR station|Stratford High Street]] (formerly known as Stratford Market) and Stratford International, as well as serving [[West Ham station|West Ham]] and [[Stratford station|Stratford]] stations. All stations will be able to accommodate 3-car trains. An important part of the project is to build new platforms at Stratford for the North London Line so that the site of the current platforms (1 and 2) is available for the new DLR platforms.

As part of the [[Transport and Works Act 1992|Transport & Works Act]] (TWA) application, the Beckton branch [[Royal Victoria DLR station|Royal Victoria station]] will be extended to accommodate 3-car trains.  The opportunity will also be taken to provide a third platform to enable trains to reverse there.  This now possible due to the closure of the eastern arm of the North London line which means the additional land necessary has become available.
 
The first contract for construction work was awarded on [[10 January]] [[2007]]<ref> [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/press-centre/press-releases/press-releases-content.asp?prID=1038 Major contract award signals start of work on DLR Stratford International Extension]</ref> and construction work started in mid-2007.

===Upgrading other lines to 3-car trains===
:'''''Status''' - Transport & Works Act approval given <ref>[http://www.transportbriefing.co.uk/story.php?id=4238 Transport Briefing DLR platform extensions secure T&W Act approval]</ref>

When work to allow 3-car trains between [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] and [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]] is complete, the only two parts of the network unable to take 3-car trains will be [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] to [[Stratford station|Stratford]] and Poplar to [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]]. Approval has been given for upgrading those two sections between 2008 and 2010 and for further grade-separation at Delta Junction north of [[West India Quay DLR station|West India Quay]] to allow enable all routes to operate without the present conflict between services to Stratford and from Bank; however, southbound services from Bank will be unable to stop at West India Quay due to the removal of the outer platform. This will, however, permit possible new services from [[Beckton]] and [[Woolwich]] to terminate at [[Canary Wharf]] or [[Lewisham]].

However TfL have stated that due to lack of committed funding the Beckton branch would not be upgraded to 3-car operation at the moment. <ref>[http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/archive/details.asp?id=142 Docklands Light Railway to increase capacity by 50 per cent with three-car trains]</ref>

===Dagenham Dock extension===
:'''''Status''' - TWA Submitted'' - Expected Completion - 2017

This proposed extension from [[Gallions Reach DLR station|Gallions Reach]] to [[Dagenham Dock railway station|Dagenham Dock]] via the riverside at Barking, would connect the Barking Reach area, a formerly industrial area now undergoing major redevelopment as part of the [[London Riverside]], with the Docklands. It would cover major developments at Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Dock Opportunity Area, and five stations are planned at [[Beckton Riverside station|Beckton Riverside]], [[Creekmouth station|Creekmouth]], [[Barking Riverside DLR station|Barking Riverside]], [[Dagenham Vale DLR station|Dagenham Vale]] and Dagenham Dock. The extension is key if [[English Partnerships]]' plan is to work. As shown in DLR's first consultation leaflet <ref>{{cite web |url= http://developments.dlr.co.uk/pdf/extensions/dagenham/dagenham_consultation_leaflet2.pdf |title=DLR Barking Riverside consultation document |accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= pdf}}</ref>, there are plans for the DLR to extend further than [[Dagenham Dock]], possibly to [[Dagenham Heathway tube station|Dagenham Heathway]] or [[Rainham railway station|Rainham]].

Construction is not expected to start until 2013 and the earliest expected completion date is 2017.

===Thames Wharf station===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

This station had been included as potential future development on the '''London City Airport extension''' since it was first planned. It would be between [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] and [[West Silvertown DLR station|West Silvertown]], due west of the western end of [[Royal Victoria Dock]]. Since the station's intended purpose is to serve the surrounding area (currently a mix of [[brownfield]] and run-down industrial sites) when it is regenerated, the development is indefinitely on hold due to the area being safeguarded for the [[Silvertown Link]], a new Thames river crossing proposed for opening by 2015.<ref name="atoproj41">AlwaysTouchOut.com (2005). ''[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/41 Silvertown Link]'' Retrieved [[February 24]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Connaught Road / Silvertown Interchange station===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

A site near to [[London City Airport]] has been identified as a possible additional station on the London City Airport extension. It would be a possible interchange with [[Crossrail]], between [[London City Airport DLR station|London City Airport]] and [[Pontoon Dock DLR station|Pontoon Dock]]. However, no plans have emerged as to when this station is to be planned and built. The original extension was designed to allow a station to be built here. It may be located south of the Connaught Crossing.<ref name="atoproj9">AlwaysTouchOut.com (2006). ''[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/9 DLR to City Airport]''. Retrieved [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Charing Cross extension===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed'' - 2026

In February 2006 a proposal to extend the DLR to [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross station]] from [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] DLR branch was revealed.<ref name="mrmarch">Ian Allan Publishing. ''Modern Railways''. March 2006''.</ref> The idea, originating from a DLR "Horizon Study", is at a very early stage at the moment, but would involve extending the line from Bank in bored tunnels under Central London to the Charing Cross [[Jubilee Line|Jubilee line]] platforms, which would be brought back to public use.  These platforms are now on a spur off the current Jubilee line and are not used by passenger trains.

While not confirmed it is probable that the scheme would also use the existing overrun tunnels between the Charing Cross Jubilee platforms and a location slightly to the west of [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych]]. These tunnels were intended to be incorporated into the abandoned Phase 2 of the ''Fleet Line'' (Phase 1 became the original Jubilee Line, prior to the Jubilee Line Extension). However they would need some enlargement because DLR [[loading gauge|gauge]] is larger than tube gauge and current safety regulations would require an emergency walkway to be provided in the tunnel.

The two reasons driving the proposal are capacity problems at Bank, having basically one interchange between the DLR and the central portion of [[London Underground|Underground]], and the difficult journeys faced by passengers from [[Kent]] and South Coast between their rail termini and the DLR. Intermediate stations would be at [[City Thameslink]] and [[Aldwych]], for future connection with the [[Cross River Tram]].

===Euston/King's Cross extension===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

During the last Horizon study, a possible extension was considered from Bank towards [[Euston railway station|Euston]] or [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]]<ref name="Hackney Council Minutes">[http://www.hackney.gov.uk/hst_-_section_5.pdf Chapter 5: Major Transport and Regeneration Projects, item 5.6.3]</ref>. The main benefit of this extension will be tapping into an area that doesn't have a direct link to the Canary Wharf site, either existing or proposed. This would create a new artery in central London and help relieve the Northern and Circle lines. There are no official plans for possible stations except towards [[Farringdon station|Farringdon]], possibly using some of the [[Thameslink Programme|soon-to-be-disused]] [[Thameslink]] infrastructure.

===Works contingent on Crossrail===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

If [[Crossrail]] is approved some of the track between Bow Church and Stratford would need to be moved to the south.  The opportunity would then be taken to double the track throughout and eliminate the only significant section of single track on the system.<ref name="mrmarch">Ian Allan Publishing. ''Modern Railways''. March 2006''.</ref>

The current route projections for the cross-London Crossrail Line 1 entail interchanges with the DLR at Custom House, Stratford, and the provision for interchanges at West India Quay (with Crossrail Isle of Dogs station) and London City Airport (with Crossrail Silvertown station). Another option would be to provide an interchange with a possible new station on the DLR (see ''Connaught Road/Silvertown Interchange station'' section above).<ref name="atoproj1">AlwaysTouchOut.com (2006). ''[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/1#Benchmark Crossrail]''. Retrieved [[February 23]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Lewisham to Catford extension===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed'' - 2026

This extension was looked at during the latest Horizon Study. The route would follow the [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] line and terminate between [[Catford railway station|Catford station]] and [[Catford Bridge railway station|Catford Bridge station]]. However early plans showed problems due to Lewisham DLR station being only marginally higher than the busy A20 road which impedes any proposed extension. The plan is however being revised.<ref>Always Touch Out [http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/129 DLR to Catford]</ref> When the Lewisham extension was first completed there were proposals to continue further to [[Beckenham]] to link it up with the [[Tramlink]] system. However, the way in which Lewisham DLR was built impeded this possible extension and would prove costly to redevelop.
