'''''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''''', an epic [[high fantasy]] novel by the [[United Kingdom|British]] author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], set in his fictional world of [[Middle-earth]], has been adapted for various media multiple times.

==Film==
Three film adaptations of ''The Lord of the Rings'' have been made. The first was ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1978), by [[animator]] [[Ralph Bakshi]], the first part of what was originally intended to be a two-part adaptation of the story. The second, ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980), was a [[television special]] by [[Rankin-Bass]]. The third was director [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy, released in three instalments as ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002), and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003).

===Early efforts===
The film rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' were held by [[Walt Disney]] for several years, before being passed to [[United Artists]], where [[Stanley Kubrick]] was attached to direct.<ref name="Beck">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=page 155 |isbn=9781556525919 }}</ref> [[The Beatles]] planned to do a live-action version with [[Paul McCartney]] as [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Ringo Starr]] as [[Sam Gamgee]], [[George Harrison]] as [[Gandalf]], and [[John Lennon]] as [[Gollum]] - but those plans came to nothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/28/rings.beatles/|title=Beatles plan for Rings film|accessdate=14 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> [[John Boorman]] was contracted by United Artists to direct an adaptation that would have collapsed the entire story into a single film.<ref name="Robinson">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22810 |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Robinson, Tasha |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 31, 2003 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=The Onion A.V.

===Animated films===
{{main|The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Return of the King (1980 film)}}
[[Image:The Lord of the Rings (1978).jpg|thumb|Ralph Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'']]
Filmmaker [[Ralph Bakshi]] was introduced to the work of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] by a director at Terrytoons in 1956. In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated.<ref name="Jim Hill Media">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Following John Boorman's attempt to adapt the books, Bakshi proposed that United Artists produce the story as three animated films.<ref name="Robinson"/> Bakshi and Dan Melnick, then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million, but the deal fell through when Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name="Robinson"/> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. United Artists agreed to produce the story as two films.<ref name="Robinson"/> Voice actors included [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], [[Michael Scholes]] and [[John Hurt]]. The film incorporated the use of rotoscoping, brief snippets of cel animation, and live-action footage mixed with animation. Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name="DirectorsSeries-1">{{cite video |people=Gallagher, John A. |date2= |month2= |year2= |title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One) |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968 |format= |medium= |publisher=Google Video |location= |accessdate= |accessmonth= |accessyear= |time= |quote= }}</ref> Once the film was completed, Bakshi was told that audiences would not pay to see an incomplete film, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name="Robinson"/><ref name="Fox News">{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=July 7, 2000 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Fox News |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The film cost $4 million to produce and grossed $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name="Beck"/> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name="Maltin">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1987 |month= |publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=0-978-0452259935 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Despite this, the studio refused to fund the sequel, which would have picked up half-way through the story and adapted the remainder of the book.<ref name="Robinson"/> ''The Lord of the Rings'' won the Golden Gryphon at the 1980 Giffoni Film Festival.<ref name="IMDb-awards">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000835/awards |title=Awards for Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-12-06 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>

In 1980, Rankin/Bass produced an animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079802/|title=The Return of the King|accessdate=16 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> based on their own concepts previously applied to their earlier animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]''.

===New Line Cinema films===
{{main|The Lord of the Rings film trilogy}}
[[Miramax]] Films developed a full-fledged [[live action]] adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' with [[Peter Jackson]] as director. Eventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, Jackson was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over.  In 1999, [[New Line Cinema]] assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the "[[Massive (software)|Massive]]" software program. ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on [[December 19]] [[2001]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' on [[December 18]] [[2002]] and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on [[December 17]] [[2003]]. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.

The films were met with both critical and commercial success. Jackson's adaptations garnered seventeen Oscars, four for ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', two for ''The Two Towers'', and eleven for ''The Return of the King''; these covered many of the award categories.

''The Return of the King'' in fact won all of the eleven awards for which it was nominated, including Best Picture.  With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history, surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28. Its 11 Oscars at the [[76th Academy Awards|2004 Academy Awards]] tied it for most awards won for one film with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' six years earlier and the 1959 version of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]].''  It also broke the previous "sweep" record, beating ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' and ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (which each took 9 out of 9). ''The Return of the King'' also made movie history as the highest grossing film opening on a Wednesday and was the second film after ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' to earn over US$1 billion worldwide. 

The ''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy is widely and currently considered to be the most popular <ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20050125/ai_n11009603 ''Remaking ''King Kong'' an honor for Jackson''] by John Horn, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> and is verified to be the currently highest grossing motion picture trilogy worldwide of all time, evidenced by its earning close to $3-billion (US) <ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/trilogyww.htm Top Box Office Earning Trilogies Worldwide at Box Office Mojo.com], last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref>, besting other notable franchises such as the [[Original trilogy|original]] ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy (without adjustment for inflation) and the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. The film trilogy also set a record for the total number of [[Academy Awards]] won, tallying a total of seventeen [[Oscars]]. <ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com], last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref>  Critical acclaim has commonly hailed the trilogy as "the greatest films of our era," <ref>[http://www.filmhobbit.com/cgi-bin/movies/movies.cgi?action=showreview&review=rotk Film Hobbit's review of ''Return of the King''], last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> and "the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal." <ref>[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan16dec16,2,3219427.htmlstory?coll=cl-mreview ''Return of the King'' review at CalendarLive.com] by [[Kenneth Turan]], last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref>

On the other hand, some readers of the book decried certain changes made in the adaptation, including changes in tone,<ref>Croft, Janet B. [http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/anticipationandflattening.htm The Mines of Moria: "Anticipation" and "Flattening" in Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring].

[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3768/is_200201/ai_n9032836 Is there a text in this Hobbit? Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring]. Originally for ''Literature Film Quarterly'', 2002. Last retrieved on 25 August 2006</ref> various changes made to characters such as [[Aragorn]], [[Arwen]], [[Denethor]] and [[Faramir]], as well as to the main protagonist [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] himself, and the deletion of the next to the last chapter of Tolkien's work, "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]".<ref>[http://www.oddlots.digitalspace.net/arthedain/ ''Filming Issues With ''The Two Towers'' Movie''] at OddLots.digitalspace.net, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref>, a part he himself felt thematically necessary.  

The trilogy's defenders assert that it is a worthy interpretation of the book, most changes stemming from the filmmakers putting the book into a modern context{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, rearranging the events into a chronologically linear narrative (as opposed to Tolkien separating the two main story threads into two separate parts for ''The Two Towers'' and most of ''The Return of the King''){{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and their perceived need for developing characters further or for sheer timing issues.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In any case, the films proved popular with general audiences (i.e. non-readers) and readers alike.

==Stage==
{{main|The Lord of the Rings (musical)}}
Several [[musical theatre]] adaptations have been made based on ''The Lord of the Rings''.  

Full-length productions of each of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' (2001), ''The Two Towers'' (2002), and ''The Return of the King'' (2003) were staged in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] [http://www.clearstagecincinnati.com/rotk/index.html].

[[Lifeline Theatre]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], produced individual plays of each of the three books over various years in the 1990s.

In 2006, a very large-scale three-and-a-half-hour musical was produced in [[Toronto]].  The expensive production lost money and closed six months later and, after some cutting and rewriting, began performances in London in May 2007.  It re-opened to mixed reviews [[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=1435048f-1738-4dea-9a46-fbda675f74f7&ParentID=ec290b61-c993-4119-b284-ae092b679651&&Headline=EMLord+of+the+Rings%2fEM+musical+gets+mixed+reviews]].

==Audio==
===1955-1956 radio play===
In 1955 and 1956, the [[BBC]] broadcast ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]],'' a 12-part radio adaptation of the story. In ''The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien'' Tolkien disparages the radio dramatization of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' referring to the portrayal of Tom Bombadil as "dreadful" and complaining bitterly about several other aspects of the dramatization.<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|no. 175}}</ref>  No recording of the 1956 series is known to exist.

===WBAI radio adaptation===
In the early 1960s radio station WBAI-FM, New York, broadcast a short adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', with music.  This version, which had not been authorized by Tolkien, was later suppressed by his legal representatives.

===1979 radio play===
A 1979 dramatization of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was broadcast in the USA and subsequently issued on tape and CD. No cast or credits appear on the audio packaging. Each of the actors was apparently recorded separately and then the various parts were edited together. Thus, unlike a BBC recording session where the actors are recorded together, none of the cast are actually interacting with each other; the performances suffer badly as a result.

===1981 radio play===
In 1981 the BBC broadcast ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]],'' a new, ambitious dramatization in 26 half-hour instalments. It stared [[Ian Holm]] as [[Frodo Baggins]], the protagonist; he would play [[Bilbo Baggins]], his character's cousin/uncle, in the live-action trilogy. <!---- This needs expansion! --->

===1990 unabridged reading===
In 1990 British actor [[Rob Inglis]] read/performed an unabridged version for [[Recorded Books]]. While not strictly an adaptation, Inglis created voices for all of the characters. And along with project producer [[Claudia Howard]], he created music for all of the songs, which he performed. The project took six weeks to record, plus preparation time. A year later he recorded an audio version of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.
