The '''Lhasa Apso''' is a small [[dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]] originally from [[Tibet]].  

==Appearance==
Lhasas are about 10 to 11 inches at the [[withers]] and weigh about 14-18 pounds. The females are slightly smaller, and weigh between 12-14lbs. The breed standard requires dark brown eyes and a black nose. Texture of the coat is heavy, straight, hard, not woolly nor silky, and very dense. A Lhasa's coat should be of good length.  All colors are equally acceptable, with or without dark tips to ears and beard. The tail should be carried in a tight screw over the back. The breed standard currently used by the American Kennel Club was approved July 11, 1978.[http://www.akc.org/breeds/lhasa_apso/index.cfm]

==Temperament==
Having been bred to be sentinel or [[guard dog|watch dog]]s, Lhasa Apsos tend to be alert and have a keen sense of hearing with a rich, sonorous bark that belies their size (some are known as "singers").{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Lhasa Apsos, although small, can exhibit brief periods of explosive energy.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.  Unique personality characteristics of Lhasa Apsos have gained them a reputation in some circles as being a very emotive breed that in some cases prove themselves to be completely fearless.

If properly raised it will come to appreciate bathing, hair combing and cutting. The Lhasa Apso is a long-lived breed, with some living in good health into their early 20s.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==History==
The heavy coat of Lhasas can also be explained by the geographical features of Tibet: the temperature frequently drops below freezing thus making it hard for a dog to survive without sufficient insulation. Lhasas were rarely groomed by their owners thus allowing the breed to adapt to the harsh weather.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

In 1901 Mrs. A. McLaren Morrison brought the Lhasa Apso to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] where it was registered as an official breed in [[The Kennel Club]] in 1902.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The original American pair was a gift from [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] to C. Suydam Cutting, arriving in the [[United States]] in the early [[1930s]].  The [[American Kennel Club]] officially accepted the breed in 1935 in the Terrier group, and in 1959 transferred the breed to the Non-Sporting group.[http://www.akc.org/breeds/lhasa_apso/history.cfm]

Recently, DNA Analysis has identified the Lhasa Apso as one of the 14 most [[ancient dog breeds]]. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/search?src=hw&site_area=sci&fulltext=ancient+dog+breeds]

In the 1950s the Lhasa Apso and [[Maltese]] were accidentally bred creating a type of dog that later became known as the [[Kyi-Leo]] rare dog breed in the 1970s.
