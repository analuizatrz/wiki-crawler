'''''Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest''''', also known as '''EE: AoC''' or '''AoC''' for short, is the official expansion pack for [[GameSpy]]'s 2001 Game of the Year: '''''[[Empire Earth (video game)|Empire Earth]]''''', one of the [[real-time strategy]] games made by ''[[Age of Empires]]'' lead designer, [[Rick Goodman]]. The game expansion pack was released in [[September 17]],[[2002]].
The Gold Edition of '''''Empire Earth''''', which features both the original and the expansion, was released on [[May 6]],[[2003]]. 

==Gameplay==
:''For further information see [[Empire Earth#Gameplay|Empire Earth Gameplay]].''
Unlike Empire Earth, ''Art of Conquest'' was not developed by [[Stainless Steel Studios]], but by [[Mad Doc Software]]. This was because the team at Stainless Steel Studios instead devoted their time and resources to creating what was then Rick Goodman's latest game: ''[[Empires: Dawn of the Modern World]]'', the spiritual successor to Empire Earth. 

The gameplay is the same as the original ''Empire Earth'', but with a few changes. Mad Doc added three new campaigns, and two new hero units for battle. [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] were also added as new civilizations, and each civilization received new powers. Difficulty was added to scenarios to those which did not receive it in an upgrade of the original Empire Earth. As with many expansion packs, new units and buildings were implemented. Another  important change was the addition of a multiplayer server, which meant that it was possible to play the game online with up to 8 other players in a lobby system or a Direct LAN connection.

The new Space Age (Epoch XV) allows the building of spaceports and [[spaceships]] on maps that allow it. Human soldiers and citizens are now replaced by robots. Farms are now run by robots as well and no longer need citizens to manage them. The Japanese civilization can create Cyber Ninjas, a special cloaked unit which can temporarily disable buildings.  Walls change from polarised titanium to force fields, and towers become more sophisticated.

In ''The Art of Conquest'', each civilization has its own power, or "civ power". Often, these powers are only available during certain epochs. A civ power gives each nation a specialty. For example, the French have the power of camouflage, which allows them to hide their military units from the enemy temporarily.

Empire Earth supports multiplayer games over LAN connections and online. Multiplayer games are identical in form to single player games.  There are 100 people online in the lobby with another 200 in games at peak hours, however, more than half of the people online at any given time are [[AFK]]. There are many [[Cheating in online games#Exploits|exploits]] which are readily available for players to use. Forums have since been started as a place to report them in an attempt to minimize the use of them.<ref> [http://forums.vugames.com/category.jspa?categoryID=30 Forum Used for catching Glitches] Retrieved February 21, 2007. </ref>

==Campaigns==
:''For further information see [[Empire Earth#Campaigns|Empire Earth Campaigns]].''
Three new campaigns were added in The Art of Conquest: a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] campaign about [[Marius]] and [[Julius Caesar]], a Pacific one involving the warfare in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during [[World War II]], and a futuristic [[Asia]]n campaign involving the colonization of Mars.

The Roman campaign revolves around the struggles of [[Marius]] as well as the conquests of [[Julius Caesar]]. The campaign begins with a war with the local tribes of Italy and barbarian invaders, in which the player can conscript citizens. The next scenario is Marius's war with [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], which the player must liberate [[Rome]] to win. The last four scenarios are about Julius Caesar's years as a general. The first scenario is about Caesar's war in the east against Sulla. The second scenario is very long and details the conquest of [[Gaul]] and the invasion of [[Britain]]. The third scenario is Caesar's war with his former ally and friend [[Pompey]], which starts with the famous crossing the [[Rubicon]] and ends at the battle of [[Farsala]]. The final scenario is the conquest of [[Egypt]].

The Pacific campaign starts with the [[Battle of Midway]] and completes with the sinking of Japanese aircraft carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|''Sōryū'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']]. The next scenario is the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] in 1943. It is followed by scenarios detailing the island-hopping campaign derived by [[Douglas MacArthur]] which include killing Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], a special mission in [[Burma]] and the [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]], and the reconquest of [[Leyte]]. The campaign is concluded with [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], completed by sending five marines to the southern tip of the Island ([[Iwo Jima|Mount Suribachi]]). (''See [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]].'')

The Asian campaign consists of two parts, the story being told from the perspective of the Kwan Do family, who claim to be descendants of the [[Qin Dynasty]]. Part One details the colonization of [[Mars]]. As soon as it is discovered that it is possible to colonize Mars, the major superpowers of Earth scramble to develop the technologies and resources needed to establish settlements on Mars. One of these powers is the newly-formed United Federation of Asian Republics (UFAR), essentially founded and controlled by the Kwan Do family, the rich owner of Kwan Do Electronics and Commnications called Hu Kwan Do. The UFAR government struggles to repress local rebellions and terrorism by those who claim that earth is the only home to mankind. Meanwhile, the UFAR also struggles to develop a colonial programme competing against rival superpowers. UFAR eventually establishes a colony on Mars, with help from Japan, along with settlements built by the US/[[Canada|Canadian]] Conglomerate, the [[European Union]] of Nations, [[Novaya Russia]], and the Republic of Japan, partitioning Mars into five regions. Part Two is set 250 years after the first part during the Space Epoch. The Kwan Do dynasty had been overthrown from power. Harsh conditions on Mars and an increasingly negative perception of the [[Earth]] governments have finally forced the Martian colonists into rebellion. During the revolutions, a descendant of the Kwan Do family, called Khan Sun Do, unites the five territories, and with the acquisition of [[Space Battleship Yamato]], the Martians fight Earth for their independence in an inter-planetary war. The campaign ends with the last battle for Martian independence and the installation of Khan Sun Do as the first leader of Mars.

The reactions to ''The Art of Conquest ''was relatively mixed. [[IGN]] gave the expansion pack a 7.8/10,<ref name="IGN"> [http://pc.ign.com/articles/372/372262p1.html Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest at IGN September 26, 2002] Retrieved February 21, 2007. </ref> while [[GameSpot]] gave a 5.2/10, saying it didn't add enough to make a difference.<ref name="Gamespot"> [http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearththeartofc/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabs Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest at Gamespot] Retrieved February 21, 2007</ref> Space was considered to be poorly implemented, as spaceships were only available on certain maps and it used the same sort of gameplay as water (i.e. a dock-type building is built and spaceships travel much like naval ships).<ref name="Gamespot" /> The graphics were not improved in this expansion pack, which some reviewers considered a detriment.<ref name="Gamespot" /> The initial price was considered steep given the features that were added, but as the expansion became discounted, this was less of an issue.
