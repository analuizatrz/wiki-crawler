'''Fort Corcoran''' was a wood-and-earthwork fortification constructed by the [[Union Army]] in northern [[Virginia]] as part of the defenses of [[Washington, D.C.]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Built in 1861, shortly after the occupation of [[Arlington, Virginia]] by Union forces, it was located at the southern end of the [[Aqueduct Bridge]] and overlooked the [[Potomac River]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]], then known as Mason's Island. Fort Corcoran was home to the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]] and served as an active military installation until 1866. 

== Occupation of Arlington ==

Before the outbreak of the Civil War, [[Arlington County|Alexandria County]] (renamed Arlington County in 1920), the northernmost [[county]] in Virginia and the closest to Washington, D.C., was a predominantly rural area. Originally part of the District of Columbia, the land now comprising the county was retroceded to Virginia in a [[July 9]], [[1846]] act of Congress that took effect in [[1847]]. Most of the county is hilly, and at the time, most of the county's population was concentrated in the city of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], at the far southeastern corner of the county. In 1861, the rest of the county largely consisted of scattered farms, the occasional house, fields for grazing livestock, and [[Arlington House]], owned by [[Mary Custis]], wife of [[Robert E. Lee]].

Following the surrender of [[Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston,]] [[South Carolina]], on [[April 14]], [[1861]], new American president Abraham Lincoln declared that "an insurrection existed," and called for 75,000 troops to be called up to quash the rebellion.<ref>E.B. Long with Barbara Long, ''The Civil War Day by Day: An Almanac 1861-1865'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1971), pp. 47-50</ref> The move sparked resentment in many other southern states, which promptly moved to convene discussions of secession. The Virginia State Convention passed "an ordinance of secession" and ordered a May 23 referendum to decide whether or not the state should seceede from the Union. The [[U.S. Army]] responded by creating the Department of Washington, which united all Union troops in the District of Columbia and Maryland under one command.<ref>Long, p. 67</ref>

[[Brigadier General]] [[Joseph K. Mansfield|J.F.K. Mansfield]], commander of the Department of Washington, argued that Northern Virginia should be occupied as soon as possible in order to prevent the possibility of the [[Confederate Army]] mounting artillery on the hills of Arlington and shelling government buildings in Washington. He also urged the erection of fortifications on the Virginia side of the [[Potomac River]] to protect the southern terminuses of the [[Chain Bridge]], [[Long Bridge]], and the [[Aqueduct Bridge]]. His superiors approved these recommendations, but decided to wait until after Virginia voted for or against secession.<ref>Cooling, Benjamin Franklin, III, Symbol, Sword, and Shield: Defending Washington During the Civil War Second Edition Revised (Shippensburg, PA: White Mane Publishing Company, 1991), pp. 32-26, 41.</ref>

On May 23, 1861, Virginia voted by a margin of 3 to 1 in favor of leaving the Union. That night, U.S. Army troops began crossing the bridges linking Washington, D.C. to Virginia. The march, which began at 10 p.m. on the night of the 23rd, was described in colorful terms by the [[New York Herald]] two days later:

<blockquote>There can be no more complaints of inactivity of the government. The forward march movement into Virginia, indicated in my despatches last night, took place at the precise time this morning that I named, but in much more imposing and powerful numbers.

About ten o'clock last night four companies of picked men moved over the Long Bridge, as an advance guard. They were sent to reconnoitre, and if assailed were ordered to signal, when they would have been reinforced by a corps of regular infantry and a battery....

At twelve o'clock the infantry regiment, artillery and cavalry corps began to muster and assume marching order. As fast as the several regiments were ready they proceeded to the Long Bridge, those in Washington being directed to take that route.

The troops quartered at Georgetown, the Sixty-ninth, Fifth, Eighth and Twenty-eighth New York regiments, proceeded across what is known as the chain bridge, above the mouth of the Potomac Aqueduct, under the command of General McDowell. They took possession of the heights in that direction.

The imposing scene was at the Long Bridge, where the main body of the troops crossed. Eight thousand infantry, two regular cavalry companies and two sections of Sherman's artillery battalion, consisting of two batteries, were in line this side of the Long Bridge at two o'clock.<ref name="NY1">''New York Herald''. "THE INSURRECTION. ADVANCE OF THE FEDERAL TROOPS INTO VIRGINIA," Washington, D.C., May 24, 1861.</ref></blockquote>

For the most part, the occupation of Northern Virginia was peaceful. The town of Alexandria was the sole exception. There, as [[Colonel]] [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]], commander of the New York Fire [[Zouaves]] ([[Eleventh New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]), entered a local hotel to remove the [[Confederate flag]] flying above it, he was shot and killed by James Jackson, the proprietor. Ellsworth was one of the first men killed in the American Civil War.<ref>Ames W. Williams, "The Occupation of Alexandria," ''Virginia Cavalcade'', Volume 11, (Winter 1961-62), pp. 33-34.</ref>

== Planning and construction ==

Over 13,000 men marched into northern Virginia on the 24th, bringing with them "a long train of wagons filled with wheelbarrows, shovels, &c."<ref name="NY1"/> These implements were put to work even as thousands of men marched further into Virginia. Engineer officers under the command of then-[[Colonel]] [[John G. Barnard]] accompanied the army and began building fortifications and entrenchments along the banks of the Potomac River in order to defend the bridges that crossed it.<ref>Cooling, Benjamin Franklin, III, ''Symbol, Sword, and Shield: Defending Washington During the Civil War'' Second Edition Revised (Shippensburg, PA: White Mane Publishing Company, 1991), p. 37</ref> By sunrise on the morning of the 24th, ground had already been broken on the first two forts comprising the Civil War defenses of Washington — [[Fort Runyon]] and '''Fort Corcoran'''.
