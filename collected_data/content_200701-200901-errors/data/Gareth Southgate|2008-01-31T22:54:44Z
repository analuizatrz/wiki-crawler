'''Gareth Southgate''' (born [[3 September]] [[1970]] in [[Crawley]], [[West Sussex]]) is an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[manager (football)|manager]] and former player. He is currently manager of English [[Premier League]] side {{fc|Middlesbrough}}.

His highest achievements in the sport were winning the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] with {{fc|Aston Villa}} and Middlesbrough. He also reached an [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Cup]] final as a player, and made 57 appearances for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. His playing career ended in May 2006 after he was appointed Middlesbrough manager.

==Club career==
===Crystal Palace===
Southgate began his career at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], playing in central midfield. He became captain and led the club to the 1994 [[Football League Division One|Division One]] title. After the south-London club's relegation from the [[Premier League]], he moved to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a fee of £2.5 million pounds, having made 151 appearances over four seasons.

===Aston Villa===
At Aston Villa, he was converted into a [[defender (football)|centre-back]] and was part of a formidable defence. In his first season, he lifted the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and Aston Villa qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]]. Southgate played in every Premier League game during the [[1998-99 in English football|1998–99]] season. He continued to play for Villa in the [[1999-00 in English football|1999–2000]] season as Villa reached the [[FA Cup Final 2000|FA Cup Final]], but handed in a transfer request just before [[Euro 2000]] citing a desire to move to a more ambitious club.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} [[John Gregory]], the then manager of Villa, attempted to keep his club captain but after a year on the transfer list he left the club in 2001.

===Middlesbrough===
Southgate did not sign for one of the major clubs as many predicted but instead became [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] manager [[Steve McClaren]]'s first signing for the club. This may have partially been due to the opportunity to reunite his defensive pairing with [[Ugo Ehiogu]] with whom he was a centre-back at Villa. Immediately he became a firm favourite at the [[Riverside Stadium|Riverside]], winning the club's Player of the Year award in his first season after a series of assured displays whilst receiving no yellow cards.

Southgate was handed the captaincy for the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03]] season when [[Paul Ince]] left the club and became the first Middlesbrough captain to lift a major trophy when he helped them win the Carling Cup at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in February 2004. His season ended shortly after that win, when he suffered knee ligament damage. 

There were strong rumours that Southgate could be set for a move to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] following [[Rio Ferdinand]]'s ban for missing a drug test in January 2004,{{Fact|date=February 2007}} but it turned out to be nothing more than paper talk. He later committed his final playing years to Middlesbrough, signing until 2007. His final appearance as a professional player was in the [[UEFA Cup]] final against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], which Boro lost [[2006 UEFA Cup Final|4–0]].

==International career==
Southgate made his debut for [[England national football team|England]] as a substitute against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in December 1995. He was then named in [[Terry Venables]]' squad for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 1996]] on home soil. At the European championship, Southgate played a towering role in England's charge to the semi-finals. However, Southgate's saved penalty against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the semi-final sent the hosts crashing out. The song ''Southgate (Euro '96)'' by [[The Business (band)|The Business]] is a reference to this famous sporting event.

Southgate also played in the [[Football World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]] and [[2000 European Football Championship|Euro 2000]]. He had won 57 England [[cap (football)|caps]] and was disappointed not to add to the figure during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] finals in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]. However, in the penultimate warm-up game ahead of the finals he captained England for the second half of a 1–1 draw with South Korea. His 50th cap came in a 1–1 draw with Portugal at [[Villa Park, England|Villa Park]] in September 2002.

==Management career==
Steve McClaren's departure from Middlesbrough, coupled with [[Terry Venables]] deciding not to return to Riverside, saw Southgate emerge as chairman [[Steve Gibson (chairman)|Steve Gibson]]'s choice to be the next manager. As Southgate does not currently hold a [[UEFA Pro Licence]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/6110858.stm]BBC News'' (Retrieved 22 November 2006)</ref>, it appeared that the Premier League would therefore not sanction his appointment. Southgate later went on to say that he wants a change in the way players can obtain coaching badges <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/football_focus/6157423.stm]</ref>. However, on [[June 7]] [[2006]] Southgate was indeed unveiled as the new manager of Middlesbrough. Southgate effectively retired from playing to concentrate on management, although he is still registered to play in case the club suffers an injury crisis. This makes him the first player-manager in the Premiership for seven years.<ref> [http://www.mfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,1~837315,00.html]</ref>

Southgate's biggest win as manager to date came at home against [[Bolton Wanderers]]. The 5–1 win on [[20 January]] [[2007]] saw Middlesbrough goals from [[Gary Speed]] (og), [[Abel Xavier]], [[Mark Viduka]] (2) and [[Stewart Downing]].

During the first few months of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007-08 season]], Southgate came under immense pressure as Middlesbrough endured a dour spell of results, in which they played seven games, losing six and drawing just one. He was repeatdly installed as the bookies favourite to be the next manager sacked, and names such as Paul Jewell and recently axed England and former Middlesbrough manager Steve McLaren were linked with his post. However Steve Gibson remained loyal to his manager, a dicision vindicated when Middlesbrough beat Arsenal 2-1, the league leaders first defeat of the season. Middlesbrough went on to win their next game, and the pressure on Southgate lifted. Many people regard this period as Southgate's most difficult so far of his management career.

==Other roles==
During the [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] season he became an author, penning ''Woody & Nord: A Football Friendship'' with close friend and former West Ham goalkeeping coach [[Andy Woodman]]. This book describes an enduring friendship forged in the Crystal Palace youth team that has survived Southgate and Woodman's wildly differing fortunes in the professional game. The book won the Sporting Book of the Year Award for 2004 from the National Sporting Club.

Southgate was also a co-commentator for ITV at the 2006 World Cup, covering group games alongside [[Clive Tyldesley]]. His appointment as Middlesbrough manager two days before the start of the tournament meant that he left Germany before the knockout phase commenced, with [[David Pleat]] replacing him as Tyldesley's sidekick.

===Personal life===
Southgate is the father of two children with his wife Allison.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/sport/2006/10/16/sfnmid16.xml</ref><ref>http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/06/50763.htm?WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished </ref>
