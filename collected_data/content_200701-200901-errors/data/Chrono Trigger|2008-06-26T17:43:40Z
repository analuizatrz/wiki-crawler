{{nihongo|'''''Chrono Trigger'''''|クロノ・トリガー|Kurono Torigā}} is a [[console role-playing game]] [[video game developer|developed]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Square Co.|Square]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[video game console]]. It was released on [[March 11]], [[1995]] in [[Japan]], and [[August 22]], [[1995]] in [[North America]]. The game's story follows a group of young adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe. 

''Chrono Trigger'' was developed by a group that [[Square Co.|Square]] called the "Dream Team", consisting of [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], [[Kazuhiko Aoki]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]—known for their works on the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series—and [[Yuuji Horii]] and artist [[Akira Toriyama]], developers for the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series.<ref name="Dream-team-name">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English | quote='''Keizo Kokubo:''' Well then, open the Gates to the Dream Team! ... / '''Developer's Ending:''' Cheers!

''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine described certain aspects of ''Chrono Trigger'' as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related [[Quest (gaming)#Side-quest|sidequests]] focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.<ref name="npreview1">{{Cite book | date=July 1995 | author=Alan Averill | title=Nintendo Power | pages=52 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> [[Square Co.|Square]] re-released a ported version by [[TOSE]] in Japan for the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation]] in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]], later repackaged with a ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' port as ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' in [[2001 in video gaming|2001]]. It has never been released in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

==Gameplay==
''Chrono Trigger'' features standard [[console role-playing game|console RPG]] gameplay with several innovations. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], consisting of various forests, cities, and [[Dungeon (computer game)|dungeons]]. Navigation occurs via an [[overworld]] map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay deviates from that of traditional RPGs in that, rather than appearing in [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.<ref name="npreview2">{{Cite book | year=1995 | author=Averill, Alan | title=Nintendo Power July, 1995 | pages=53 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> This concept had previously been featured in such titles as ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'', but was uncommon at the time for RPGs outside the [[Action role-playing game|action RPG]] genre.
[[Image:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG|thumb|256px|left|Example of a basic battle]]
Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves.  Each character and enemy has a certain number of [[hit point]]s, and successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, while hit points can be restored with potions and spells.  When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose.  Between battles, the player can equip his/her characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles.  Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in [[Treasure chest (video games)|treasure chests]].  By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story.

''Chrono Trigger'' uses an [[Square Enix battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system—a staple of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series designed by [[Hiroyuki Itō]] for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—named "Active Time Battle 2.0".<ref name="gafreview">{{cite web | author=Robert Johnson | title=Final Fantasy IV Review | date=2003-04-28 | url=http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/review.php?reviewid=197 | work=http://www.gamesarefun.com/ GamesAreFun | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]] counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called "Techs". Techs deplete a character's [[magic point]]s (a numerical meter like hit points), and often have special [[area of effect|areas of effect]]; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist.<ref name="npreview2" /> Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning ''Cyclone'' Tech can be combined with Lucca's ''Flame Toss'' to create ''Fire Whirl''. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

''Chrono Trigger'' features several other unique gameplay traits, including [[time travel]]. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called "time gates", as well as a [[Time travel|time machine]] named ''[[Epoch (Chrono Trigger)|Epoch]]''. The game contains thirteen unique endings; the ending the player receives depends on when and how he or she reaches and completes the game's final battle.<ref name="nppreview">{{Cite book | date=June 1995 | author=Alan Averill | title=Nintendo Power | pages=37 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref><ref name="endings2">{{cite web | author=Pringle, Bill | year=2005 | title=Chrono Trigger Endings | url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/w/r/wrp103/wrp/ct_end.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070705181358/http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/w/r/wrp103/wrp/ct_end.html | archivedate=2007-07-05 | work=[http://www.personal.psu.edu/ Penn State Personal Web Server] | accessmonthday=May 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''Chrono Trigger'' also introduces a [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] option—after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character [[Experience point|levels]], [[Skill (role-playing games)|techniques]], and equipment (but not money) that he or she ended the previous game with. Certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has since employed the New Game+ concept in later titles, including ''[[Vagrant Story]],'' ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve series|Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.

{{main|Characters of Chrono Trigger}}
[[Image:Chrono Trigger Magus battle artwork.PNG|thumb|256px|Promotional art illustrating Crono, Lucca, and Frog battling Magus]]
''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s seven playable characters come from different eras in the game world's history. ''Trigger'' begins in 1000 A.D. with [[Crono]], [[Marle (Chrono Trigger)|Marle]], and [[Lucca (Chrono Trigger)|Lucca]]. Crono is a silent protagonist, characterized as a brave, fearless young man skilled with a [[katana]]. Marle is Princess Nadia of the Guardia kingdom—an active, spirited [[tomboy]] with a [[crossbow]]. Often at odds with her father, Marle hides her royal lineage to slip out of the castle. Lucca is a friend of Crono and a mechanical genius who wields a gun; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From the era of 2300 A.D. comes [[Robo (Chrono Trigger)|Robo]], a robot with a bright and curious personality created to assist humans and outfitted with a powerful arm. Found dormant in the future, Robo is repaired by Lucca and joins the group in gratitude.<ref name="characters">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Square Enix | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=32–33 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-01363}}</ref>

The fiercely confident [[Ayla (Chrono Trigger)|Ayla]] dwells in 65,000,000 B.C. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village, and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid [[reptile|reptiles]] known as Reptites. The last two characters—[[Frog (Chrono Trigger)|Frog]], and the optional character [[Magus (Chrono Trigger)|Magus]]—originate in 600 A.D. Frog is a former [[squire]] once named Glenn; Magus the warlock turned Glenn into an [[anthropomorphic]] frog and slew his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus by killing Magus. Magus is a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] and the leader of the Mystics, a race of demons and intelligent animals who war against humanity.  Magus was once known as Janus, the young prince of the [[Kingdom of Zeal]], which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 B.C. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, [[Schala]].<ref name="characters" /> Lavos, which destroys human civilization and ravages the world in 1999 A.D., is an extraterrestrial parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the earth's energy for its own evolution.

===Story===
''Chrono Trigger'' begins with the 1000 A.D. Millennial Fair, where Crono and Marle sample Lucca's new teleportation device. Marle volunteers, but disappears through a strange portal when the machine reacts with her pendant.<Ref name="portal">'''Taban:''' What's going on Lucca? WHERE IS SHE? / '''Lucca:''' The way she disappeared... It couldn't have been the Telepod! The warp field seemed to be affected by her pendant... {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Crono asks to be sent through the machine to find her, and discovers he's traveled back 400 years. He meets Marle at Guardia Castle, and learns that a search party looking for the missing queen of that era found her instead.<Ref name="shes-marle">'''Queen:''' Fooled you, didn't I, Crono? / '''Marle:''' It's me! But everyone calls me, Leene! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Marle then vanishes; Lucca arrives and claims that she's actually the princess of Guardia in 1000 A.D., and that since her ancestor was not rescued, Marle [[grandfather paradox|ceased to exist]]. With the help of a talking amphibian called Frog, Crono and Lucca rescue the real Queen, kidnapped by "Mystics" who worship the [[Wizard (character class)|wizard]] Magus. Marle reappears and the group returns to 1000 A.D., where Crono is placed on trial for allegedly kidnapping Marle. He's sentenced to death, but breaks free from the prison. With Marle and Lucca, he flees the king, to nearby Guardia Forest, where they stumble into a time gate.

They're shocked to find a devastated world filled with futuristic ruins, and uncover a video of the "Day of Lavos". The video shows a creature called Lavos erupting from the planet's surface in 1999 A.D and decimating the planet.<Ref name="dayoflavos">'''Marle:''' Say, what does this button do? / '''Lucca:''' 1999 A.D.? Visual record of The Day of Lavos... / ''''Marle:''' Wh, what...IS that? / '''Lucca:''' Lavos?...

Crono and his friends hear that Magus created Lavos during the Middle Ages of 600 A.D., and that only a sword wielded by the "Hero" called the Masamune can defeat him.<Ref name="lavos-created">'''Heckran:''' If only the great Magus who brought forth Lavos 400 years ago, had destroyed the human race! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> They find the sword's broken blade, deducing that the Hero is Frog and that the sword was somehow made by Melchior, who lives in 1000 A.D. Melchior notes that he needs Dreamstone, a rock found only in antiquity, to repair the Masamune. The group travel to 65,000,000 B.C. and meet the cavewoman Ayla, who gives Crono her Dreamstone after a friendly drinking contest. Ayla's boyfriend gets jealous of Crono, thinking that Ayla likes him better and steals the Time Key, but other than that they're able to get back without a problem. <Ref name="frog'sresolve">'''Frog:''' This sword... 'Tis the Masamune? I must ponder this turn of events. Remain'eth here the night. ... / '''Frog:''' Awaketh, Crono.

[[Image:CTmeetmagus.JPG|thumb|left|259px|Confrontation with Magus]]
Melchior repairs the sword, and Frog accompanies Crono as they set out to Magus's lair. They battle his three generals and confront the warlock in the process of casting a spell. Magus claims he did not create Lavos, who dwells within the planet to siphon its energy—but merely intended to summon it.<Ref name="only-summoned">'''Magus:''' You fools! I only «summoned» him! He lives in the inner earth, absorbing the land's power and growing ever stronger! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> The spell's interruption causes a massive time gate that swallows Magus's castle and everyone within. Crono and his friends awaken in 65,000,000 B.C.; after helping Ayla defeat the Reptites, they witness Lavos crash deep into the earth from above. Agreeing that Lavos is an extraterrestrial lifeform, the group travels to the ancient, enlightened Kingdom of Zeal in 12,000 B.C. Zeal recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine. A mysterious prophet warns the kingdom's queen about Crono, forcing their return to prehistory with no way back, by sealing the time gate they used to get there. In 2,300 A.D. they find a ship-like time machine called the Wings of Time (or ''Epoch''), which can access any time period without using a time gate.

They travel back to Zeal, where the Ocean Palace will soon be activated. Lavos awakens, disturbed by the Mammon Machine, and the prophet reveals himself to be Magus before attempting to kill the creature.<Ref name="magusrevealed">'''Magus:''' I've waited for this... I've been waiting for you, Lavos. I swore long ago... that I'd destroy you! No matter what the price! It is time to fulfill that vow. Feel my wrath, Lavos!! ... / '''Magus:''' Aaah!! My powers are being drained! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Crono stands up to Lavos but is vaporized by a powerful blast. Schala, Zeal's princess, selflessly saves Magus and Crono's friends by transporting them to safety. Lavos destroys the kingdom of Zeal, causing tidal waves that reshape the planet. Soon after, Dalton from Zeal declares himself ruler of the world via the Blackbird airplane. He detains the group and impounds the Epoch, which his henchmen modify to fly. Crono's friends defeat Dalton atop the redesigned Epoch and meet on the surface with Magus, who admits that he's the young prince Janus, and plotted to summon and kill Lavos in 600 A.D.<ref name="janus">'''Magus:''' Behold. Everything's at the bottom of the sea. Gone is the magical kingdom of Zeal, and all the dreams and ambitions of its people. I once lived there...

Crono and his friends then attack Queen Zeal in her risen Ocean Palace fortress (now called the Black Omen) and destroy the Mammon Machine at its heart. The Queen calls forth Lavos, and the team penetrate the creature's shell either through fierce fighting or by crashing the Epoch into it. They learn that Lavos has been harvesting [[DNA]] to control its own evolution.<ref name="lavos-purpose">'''Lucca:''' It lives on a planet for as long as possible, stealing away the most vital resources...

At the final night of the fair, Crono and his friends say their goodbyes and adjourn to their own eras in time through the diminishing gates. If Magus joined the party, he departs to search for his missing sister, Schala. Crono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, prompting Crono, Marle and Lucca to set out in the Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky.<ref name="crono'smom">'''Mom:''' Look, Crono!

Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each others arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.

Square released an enhanced [[porting|port]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' developed by [[TOSE]] in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Square timed its release before that of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', the 1999 sequel to ''Trigger'', to give new players familiarity with the story of its predecessor.<Ref name="ultimania" /> This version included [[anime]] cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's [[Bird Studio]] and animated by [[Toei Animation]], as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cut scenes would illustrate subtle ties to ''[[Chrono Cross]]''.<ref name="ultimania" /> The port was later released in North America in 2001—along with a [[remaster]]ed version of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—under the package title ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]''. Reviewers criticized ''Chronicles'' for lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features.<ref name="loadtime" /><ref>{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles Review for PlayStation | url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/reviews/review.pl?sys=psx&game=ffc | work=[http://www.gaming-age.com Gaming Age] | accessdate=July 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

''Chrono Trigger'' was scored by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] and veteran ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda was unhappy with his pay and threatened to leave Square if he could not compose music.<ref name="powerup" /> Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score ''Chrono Trigger'', remarking, "maybe your salary will go up."<Ref name="mitsuda2008" /> Mitsuda reflected, "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing."<ref name="powerup" /> Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain songs—such as ''To Far Away Times''—to inspiring dreams.<Ref name="mitsuda2008" /> After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score.<ref name="powerup">{{Cite book | date=2004 | author=[[Chris Kohler]] | title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]] | publisher=DK Publishing | language=English | id=ISBN 0-7440-0424-1}}</ref> Mitsuda considers ''Chrono Trigger'' a landmark title which helped mature his talent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=5478 |title=Yasunori Mitsuda Interview |accessdate=2007-05-22 | author=James Gay | date=2006-10-13 | work=[http://palgn.com.au/ PAL Gaming Network]}}</ref>

At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented—the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.<ref name="npreview1" /> Square also released a one-disc [[acid jazz]] arrangement called "''[[The Brink of Time]]''" by [[Guido (jazz band)|Guido]] that year. In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of ''Trigger'', featuring [[orchestra]]l tracks used in [[cut scene]]s. Yasunori Mitsuda also composed four new pieces for the game's bonus features which weren't included on the soundtrack. Recently, Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the ''Chrono'' series for [[Play!

''Chrono Trigger'' garnered much critical praise in addition to its brisk sales. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' called it Square's "biggest game ever", citing improved graphics, sound, and gameplay over past RPG titles.

==Sequels==
''Chrono Trigger'' inspired several [[sequel]]s and [[spin-off]]s; the first were three titles released for the [[Satellaview]] in 1995. They included ''Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special'', a [[racing game]] based on a [[minigame]] from the original; ''Chrono Trigger: Character Library'', featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game; and ''Chrono Trigger: Music Library'', a collection of music from the game's soundtrack. The contents of ''Character Library'' and ''Music Library'' were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of ''Chrono Trigger''. [[Production I.G]] created a 16-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]] entitled "''[[Nuumamonja: Time and Space Adventures]]''" broadcasted at the [[Japan]]ese [[V-Jump]] Festival of [[July 31]], [[1996]].<ref>{{cite web |title=時空冒険ぬうまもんじゃ～ |url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/0330_/index.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar |url=http://www.production-ig.com/contents/works/07_/000133.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref>

Square released a fourth Satellaview game in 1996, named ''[[Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki]]''.
