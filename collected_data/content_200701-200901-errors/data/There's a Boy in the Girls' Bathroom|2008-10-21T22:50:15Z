'''''There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom''''' is a juvenile fiction book from the author [[Louis Sachar]]. The title comes from a point when the  character, Jeff, accidentally enters the girl's bathroom and is horribly embarrassed by it.


==Storyline== 
Bradley Chalkers is the [[protagonist]] of the book. In his school, his teachers and fellow classmates prefer to ignore him. He sits at the back of the class, last seat, last row, and never pays any attention, preferring to cut up pieces of paper, or partake in other mindless tasks which keep his mind off the lesson. He is proud whenever he receives an ''[[Grade (education)#United States|F]]'' on his class tests. He wants everyone to hate him, because he believes that they will then leave him alone. Everyone hates him, including the teachers. 

A new classmate, Jeff Fishkin, comes in from [[Washington, DC]], and the only two remaining seats are the ones beside and in front of Bradley. Jeff tries to reason with Bradley, but fails, like everyone else. Then a [[School counselor|counselor]] named Carla is appointed, and she cannot wait to meet Bradley. Carla says she wants to be friends with Bradley, and she begins to try to open him up and reveal his kind interior, which he has been trying to hide. Bradley refuses to come quietly, and his conflicting emotions with Carla and other people induces [[strife]] among his fellow schoolmates. As he meets with Carla more and more, he slowly decides to become a better person book she owns. Bradley thinks that the book is magical and responsible for his changes.

A subplot of the book involves Jeff and a girl named Colleen Verigold (described as having "red hair and a freckled face"), who seem to have crushes on each other. Bradley thinks girls are gross, and especially hates Colleen's best friend, the outspoken Lori. At the beginning of the book, Bradley becomes irritated with Jeff for saying "Hi" to Colleen whenever she says "Hi" to him. Later, Carla tells Jeff and Colleen that Zen Buddhist monks are required to say "Hi" to each other when they meet. Later in the book, Bradley proves his friendship to Jeff by saying "Hi" to him. Towards the end of the book, as Carla helps Bradley change, he is invited to Colleen's birthday party, along with Jeff, and he even wins the party games, getting a harmonica as a prize.

Another subplot involves Bradley's collection of animal figurines, who are all alive and all love Bradley in his imagination. His two favorites are Ronnie, a wooden rabbit, and Bartholomew, a ceramic bear. Ronnie and Bartholomew love each other. After Bradley finds out Carla is leaving, all the other animals decide they don't like Ronnie, and Bartholomew pushes her into a lake, leaving her to drown. In a later scene, Bartholomew saves Ronnie, and they all like each other once more. Bartholomew and Ronnie get married.

Unfortunately, Carla is not as popular with many parents of the students. Colleen's mother becomes angry with her for supposedly preaching religion (telling Jeff and Collen about the Zen Buddhist monks) and counseling Colleen without permission. As a result, Carla is fired and becomes a kindergarten teacher. When he hears this, Bradley becomes very upset and threatens to revert back to his original behavior. Although he misses saying goodbye to Carla, he does return to the school and finds a package she leaves for him. The package contains a goodbye note from her and her book. In the end, Bradley starts to come to terms with Carla's departure. He writes her a goodbye letter of his own and sends his most prized possession with it, Ronnie.

==Characters of the book==
* '''Bradley Chalkers''' - Considered the meanest kid in school, and no one wants to talk to him, however after he meets Carla he realizes that if he believes the people who call him a "monster", then that is what he will become. He must believe in himself.
* '''Jeff Fishkin''' - Colleen's crush and the new kid. Has a habit of automatically saying "Hello" or "Hi" to people when they greet him. He becomes Bradney's friend, only because he was paid a dollar. Later, he rejects him for cooler friends. After Bradley starts acting nicer, he and Jeff become friends again.
* '''Colleen Verigold''' - Jeff's crush. She has a birthday at the end of the story and invites all her friends, as well as Jeff and Bradley.
* '''Melinda Birch''' - Colleen's tough best friend. Fights with Bradley frequently, although she likes him better by the end of the book.
* '''Lori Westin''' - the biggest gossip in school. Nicknamed "Lori Loud Mouth" by Brad.
* '''Carla Davis''' - the school counselor. Unlike the teachers at the school, she prefers to persuade students to do the right thing instead of outright telling them what to do. Although students like Jeff, Bradley, and Colleen like her, she is very unpopular among the parents, who believe that a counselor is unnecessary. She is the reason for Bradley's turnaround. She believes in him and gives him confidence.
* '''Mrs. Chalkers''' - Bradly's mother. She cares about him and tries to help him out.
* '''Mr. Chalkers''' - Bradly's father. A former police officer who was shot by a robber and limps as a result.

Although he originally doesn't like the school having a counselor, he changes his mind when he sees how much she helps Bradley.
* '''Claudia Chalkers''' - Bradly's  14-year-old sister. She usually teases him and is mean. She is occasionally nice however, such as when she buys him Bartholomew after she accidentally breaks Ronnie's ear or when she helps him with his math homework.
* '''Ronnie''' - Bradley's favorite toy animal, a wooden rabbit. She is very real in his imagination, as a funny, happy-go-lucky rabbit that's also in love with Bartholomew. She has a broken ear given to her by Claudia. She can be seen as a personification of the friendship Bradley wants, as he imagines her speaking to him in the same way Carla does.
* '''Bartholomew''' - Bradley's ceramic bear that Claudia bought for him after she broke Ronnie's ear. In Bradly's stories, he's usually the hero, and is in love with Ronnie.He can be seen as a personification of who Bradley wants to be (a hero with lots of friends and someone who loves him). 
* '''Mrs. Ebbel''' - Bradly's teacher. She teaches her class at Room 12. She has very little faith in Bradley to succeed and expresses her concern to Bradly's mother.
