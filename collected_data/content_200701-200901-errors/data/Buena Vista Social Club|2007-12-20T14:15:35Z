The '''Buena Vista Social Club''' was a [[Social club|members club]] in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] that held dances and musical activities, becoming a popular location for musicians to meet and play during the 1940s. In the 1990s, nearly 40 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by [[Music of Cuba|Cuban musician]] [[Juan de Marcos González]] and American guitarist [[Ry Cooder]] with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity.   

The recording, named ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' after the Havana institution, became an international success, and the ensemble was encouraged to perform with a full line-up in [[Amsterdam]] in 1998. German director [[Wim Wenders]] captured the performance on film, followed by a second concert in [[Carnegie Hall]], [[New York City]] for a [[documentary film|documentary]] that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders's film, also called ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (movie)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'', was released to critical acclaim, receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary feature]] and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the [[European Film Awards]].

The success of both the album and film sparked a revival of international interest in traditional Cuban music and [[Latin American music]] in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with international stars from different musical genres. The "Buena Vista Social Club" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's "musical golden age" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble:  [[Compay Segundo]], [[Rubén González]], and [[Ibrahim Ferrer]], who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.

The Buena Vista Social Club was a black members-only club located in the populous Marianao neighborhood, in Cuba's capital [[Havana]]. According to Juan Cruz, a former [[master of ceremonies]] at the ''Salon Rosado Benny Moré'' nightclub in Havana, the club was located "on ''Calle'' 41 between 46 and 48".<ref name="afro Cuban">Godfried, Eugène.

In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder had been invited to Havana by British [[world music]] [[Record producer|producer]] Nick Gold of [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit Records]] to record a session where two [[Africa]]n [[High-life]] musicians from [[Mali]] were to collaborate with Cuban musicians.<ref name="interview"/> On Cooder's arrival (via [[Mexico]] to avoid the ongoing [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba]]),<ref name="telegraph">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/1997/06/28/brcuba28.xml "Hurricane Cooder hits Cuba"].

Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban [[Son Cubano (music)|son]] music with local musicians.<ref name="interview"/> 

Already on board the African collaboration project were Cuban musicians including bassist [[Orlando "Cachaito" López]], guitarist [[Eliades Ochoa]] and musical director [[Juan de Marcos González]], who had himself been organizing a similar project for the [[Afro-Cuban All Stars]]. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer [[Manuel "Puntillita" Licea]], pianist [[Rubén González]] and octogenarian singer [[Compay Segundo]], who all agreed to record for the project.<ref name="interview"/>

Within three days of the project's birth, Cooder, Gold and de Marcos had organized a large group of performers and arranged for recording sessions to commence at Havana's [[EGREM]] Studios, formerly owned by [[RCA]] records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s.<ref>Steward, Sue.

== Performances ==
The first performances by the full line up of "Buena Vista Social Club", including Cooder, were those filmed by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York. Other international shows and T.V. appearances soon followed with varying line ups. Ibrahim Ferrer and Rubén González performed together in [[Los Angeles]] in 1998 to an audience that included [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Sean Combs]], and [[Jennifer Lopez]], Ferrer dedicating the song ''Mami Me Gusto'' to the [[Hispanic]] Lopez.<ref>Milanovic Anji.

Performances in Florida, which has a large [[Cuban exile]] and [[Cuban American]] community, were rare after the release of the film due to the political climate.

== Impact and analysis ==
The international success of the Buena Vista Social Club generated a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and [[Latin American music]] as a whole.<ref name="Torres">Torres, George. "Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz (review)". ''Notes'', Volume 60, Number 2, December 2003, pp. 426-428.</ref> Musical director Juan de Marcos felt that the recordings serve "as a symbol of the power of Cuban music, and which to a certain degree have contributed to Cuban music regaining the status it always had in Latin American and world music."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/musicians/bios/demarcos_edited_int_eng.html "Interview with Juan de Marco González in Havana, by Betty Arcos, host, ”The Global Village”  Pacifica Radio January 1, 1998"]. ''Buena Vista Social Club'' site. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Retrieved [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref>   

Cuba's burgeoning [[Tourism in Cuba|tourist industry]] of the late 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to [[The Economist]] magazine, "In the tourist quarters of [[Old Havana]] it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's as if you were to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner."<ref>[http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displayStory.cfm?story_ID=8401940&subjectid=7933598   "Now we make politics".] ''[[The Economist]]'' ([[December 15]] [[2006]]). Retrieved [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Despite the appeal of the "Buena Vista" ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the "Buena Vista Social Club" than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[pop music]] and other musical forms such as [[reggaeton|reggaetón]] on the island.<ref name="global">Santiago, Chiori.

Mari Marques, a Cuban American who leads cultural tours to Cuba, contests that the preponderance of traditional musicians was not solely a consequence of the "Buena Vista Social Club". Marques believes the notion that son music had been completely neglected in Cuba is "a romantic exaggeration that was propagated by U.S. media coverage", and the reality is that son trios have existed "everywhere in cities such as [[Santiago de Cuba]] in the east of the island."<ref name="global"/> British world music record label Tumi music, who had worked with de Marcos and many of the ensemble musicians prior to Cooder, asserted that Cuba has over 50,000 musicians all as good as, and some as old as the "Buena Vista" participants, "but these people hardly ever have the opportunity to share their talents with the outside world." The label lamented that, "for the West to pay any real attention and consume the product, you needed someone like Ry Cooder to give it a stamp of approval first."<ref>[http://www.tumimusic.com/english/newsletter.htm "Tumi celebrate their 100th recording after two decades dedicated to bringing Latin American music, arts and culture to Europe."] Tumi music.

Writer and academic [[Mike Gonzalez (historian)|Mike Gonzalez]] believes the ensemble provoked a backward glance to "timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music". Gonzalez asserts that the aura evoked did not represent "the real Cuba" before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to "enjoy the fruits of this confusion".<ref>Gonzalez, Mike.

The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era &mdash; dominated by the politics of [[Gerardo Machado]] in the 1920s&ndash;30s and then General [[Fulgencio Batista]] until 1959 &mdash; which "no longer seems so bad".<ref>[http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.2/mr_4.html ''Buena Vista Social Club'' Film review].
