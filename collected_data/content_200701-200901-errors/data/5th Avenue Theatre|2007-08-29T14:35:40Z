[[Image:5th Ave Theater Entry (Seattle) 2007-08.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Entry to theatre with decorative brackets above]]
Located in the Skinner Building, an historic office block ranging from five to eight stories with retail on the ground level, the theatre is surrounded on three sides, with its entry facing its [[namesake]] avenue.  In addition to an [[auditorium]] with an original seating capacity of 3,000, the  theatre contains a grand entry hall, and a [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] that once featured a [[tea room]] in addition to a [[waiting room]] and women's lounge.<ref name="Ventilation_ST_09-23-26">{{Citation |title= Opening of Fifth Avenue Theatre friday is big event: Comfort is first at new theatre |pages= p. 16 col. 5 |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |date= [[1926]]-[[September_23|09-23]]}}</ref> 

The [[interior design]] of the 5th Avenue Theatre was modeled to reproduce some of the features of the most historic and well-known [[Beijing]] landmarks.  The [[Norwegian]] artist [[Gustav Liljestrom]] executed the design based on his visit to [[China]] and the illustrated account of Ernst Boerschmann's travels there, ''Chinesische Architecktur'', published in [[1925]].<ref name="NRHPNomination">{{cite web |last= Seattle Office of Urban Conservation   |authors= Florence K. Lentz |title= National Register of Historic Places Inventory -- Nomination Form |publisher= [[National Park Service]], [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]] |date= March [[1978]] |url= http://www.dahp.wa.gov/gis/pdfs/432.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2007-08-16 }}</ref>

The ornate historical [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] style of the theatre distinguishes itself from the [[Neo-Renaissance]] exterior of the Skinner Building.  Only at the street entry under the [[marquee]] does the viewer get a preview of the interior design.  Here, adorning the ceiling are [[plaster]] representations of wood [[bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s, [[beam (structure)|beam]]s, and carved [[relief]]s painted in a [[wikt:polychromatic|polychromatic]] scheme and decorated with stenciled dragons and flower patterns.  Carved cloud shapes screen light fixtures to create an indirect lighting effect as the viewer approaches the wooden, brass knobbed entry doors.  The original central free-standing [[box office]] was replaced by the current box office located to the side of the entry as part of a [[1979]] renovation.<ref name="NRHPNomination" />  The original [[Imperial guardian lions]] (''Ruì Shī''), commonly called foo dogs or foo lions, originally located outside the entry were moved inside as part of the 1979 renovation. 

[[Image:5th Ave Theater FooDog (Seattle) 2007-08.jpg|thumb|100px|left| Male Imperial guardian lion.]]The interior architecture of the theatre is an "excellent imitation of Chinese wooden temple construction".<ref name="NRHPNomination" />  The two story rectangular [[lobby]] features red, stenciled columns wrapped in plaster rising to a timbered roof structure of decoratively painted beams supporting a canopy of bamboo, also imitated in plaster.  The original pair of guardian lions, both male, guard the [[stairway]] to a second level gallery that serves the theatre balcony.  In addition to the Imperial guard lions, other original furnishings, light fixtures, and decoration remain intact.

The decorative details continue in the 2,130-seat auditorium, but the highlight and focal decorative feature is the octagonal [[Caisson (Asian architecture)|caisson]] from which a sculpted five-toed [[Imperial]] [[Chinese dragon]] springs.  A large chandelier of glass hangs from the dragon's mouth, in reference to the Chinese symbol of a dragon disgorging flaming pearls.<ref name="Walters">{{cite book |last=Walters |first=Derek |title=Chinese Mythology |publisher=Diamond Books |date= 1995 |location= London |pages= 45 |isbn= 9780261666573 }}</ref>  One claim puts the size of this caisson at twice the size of the model on which it was based in the throne room of the [[Hall of Supreme Harmony]] in the [[Forbidden City]].<ref name="historictheater" />  The opening night program spoke effusively of it:

[[Image:5th Ave Theater Caisson (Seattle) 2007-08.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Dragon and Pearl ceiling centerpiece.]]
:''"...Its most imposing feature is the great dome...its symbolic themes borrowed from Chinese legends, its motifs from Chinese poetry.  Coiled within an azure sphere and surrounded by glowing hues of cloud red, emblematic of calamity and welfare; blue of rain; green symbolic of plaque; black of flood; and gold of prosperity--is the Great Dragon, guardian genius of the place, his presence shadowed and multiplied in varying forms throughout the structure.  On the huge beams surrounding and supporting the dome are five-clawed dragons--the Emperor's emblem--spitting fire in pursuit of the Jewel, rendered in the shape of a disc emitting effulgent rays, and symbolic of Omnipotence."''<ref name="NRHPNomination" />

The dragon [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] is repeated in the radial coffers of the caisson and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre.  The Imperial dragon is accompanied by the symbol of the Empress, the [[Fenghuang|Chinese phoenix]] ''(Fèng huáng)'', erroneously called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese.  This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but in relief as part of the grills above false balconies that once screened organ pipes.  In addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre.  The highly decorated [[proscenium]] arch and [[safety curtain]] maintain the Chinese design influence.<ref name="NRHPNomination" />

Beyond the decorative features of the building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when orignally built.  An ascending [[orchestra pit]] and independent [[Wurlitzer]] organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below.<ref name="OrchestraPit_ST_09-23-26">{{Citation |title= Opening of Fifth Avenue Theatre friday is big event: Rising orchestra pit is feature of theatre |pages= p. 16 col. 1-4 |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |date= [[1926]]-[[September_23|09-23]]}}</ref> The ventilation system had [[thermostat|thermostatic]] controls throughout the building, and allowed the air to be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.<ref name="Ventilation_ST_09-23-26" />

==History==
===Planning and construction===
The president and general manager of Pacific Northwest Theatres, Inc., Harry C. Arthur, believed Seattle to be a place of growing importance in the motion picture industry in the mid-1920s, and consequently as the place to invest for the long term.<ref name="ST_09-04-26">{{Citation |title= Seattle's future is best in nation says theatre man |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |pages= p. 10 col. 1-2 |date= [[1926]]-[[September_4|09-04]]}}</ref>  Arthur's company absorbed a competing chain of 40 theatres by 1926, and sought further expansion.  A large holder of the theatre company's stock and debt was [[C. D. Stimson]] who sat on the board of directors of both Pacific Northwest Theatres and the Metropolitan Building Company, developer of what became known as the [[Metropolitan Tract (Seattle)|Metropolitan Tract]].  Stimson promoted the establishment of a theatre district like that which had developed around a theatre he had built in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name="Kreisman_StimsonLegacy">{{cite book |last= Kreisman |first= Lawrence  |title= The Stimson Legacy: Architecture in the Urban West |publisher= Willows Press/University of Washington Press |date= 1992 |location= Seattle  |pages= 144-145 |isbn= 978-0-96-316300-4}}</ref> The planned Skinner Building  with a theatre owned by Arthur's company would complete the Stimson development of the Metropolitan Tract.<ref name="ST_Complete_09-23-26">{{Citation |title= Metropolitan unit complete: Skinner Building ranks high |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times|The Seattle Daily Times]] |pages= p. 8 col. 1-2 |date= [[1926]]-[[September_23|09-23]]}}</ref>

The architect, [[Robert Reamer]], had joined the Metropolitan Building Company after World War I and as their house architect designed the Skinner Building and the 5th Avenue Theatre.<ref name="Kreisman_StimsonLegacy" /><ref name="Ochsner_Architects">{{cite book |last= Ochsner |first= Jeffrey Karl, ed. |title= Shaping Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects |publisher= University of Washington Press |date=1998 |location= Seattle |pages= 186-191 |isbn= 0295973668}}</ref>  In creating the 5th Avenue Theatre, Reamer was joined by his colleague, Joseph Skoog, of Reamer's office and Gustav Liljestrom, of the S. & G. Gump Company of San Francisco.<ref name="historylink1">{{cite web |first= Eric L. |last= Flom|url= http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3753|title=Fifth (5th) Avenue Theatre opens in Seattle amid gala celebration on September 24, 1926. |publisher= Historylink.org |accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref>

Construction began in October of [[1925]] with construction taking 11 months.<ref name="ST_Complete_09-23-26" />

===Grand opening===
The theatre celebrated its grand opening on [[September 24]], [[1926]]<ref name="historylink1" />

Following the grand opening, The theatre served as a venue for [[vaudeville]], then operated as a movie palace until the 1970s. Facing severe financial difficulties, it was forced to close its doors in [[1978]] along with neighboring theatres the Metropolitan and the Orpheum. Possibilities for the site included a Chinese restaurant, a triplex movie theatre, an office building, and a shopping center.<ref name="historictheater">{{cite web|url=http://www.5thavenue.org/about/ourhistorictheater.aspx|title=Our Historic Theater|publisher=5thAvenue.org|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref><ref name="historylink2">{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3750|title=Fifth (5th) Avenue Theatre|publisher=historylink.org|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref><ref name="still"/>

===Restoration===
43 business leaders banded together in [[1979]] and underwrote a $2.6 million loan to save The 5th.

Several changes were made during the renovation: the orchestra pit and auditorium seating were rebuilt, the dressing rooms moved, and the technical systems updated. However, the furniture, fixtures and signage are original. Even the paint was carefully restored to its original luster. 

[[June 16]], [[1980]] marked the theatre’s rebirth and a new chapter in Seattle’s arts community. Now a historic landmark, The 5th continues to thrive with the assistance of many generous donors and volunteers.<ref name="historictheater"/><ref name="still"/>

===Post-1980 history===
Following the renovation, The 5th Avenue has become one of Seattle's most established theatres. In [[1989]], The 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company was established as a resident non-profit theatre company.<ref name="founders">{{cite web|url=http://www.5thavenue.org/about/founders.aspx|title=Founders|publisher=5thAvenue.org|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> Since 1980, The 5th Avenue Theatre has produced or presented more than 3,000 performances of nearly 100 productions, attended by over 5.5 million people.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Today, The 5th Avenue Theatre proudly produces top-quality musical revivals, premieres of bound-for-Broadway shows, and present touring Broadway musicals. They also host a variety of special events, and offer a number of education and outreach programs to school-age children and adults.
