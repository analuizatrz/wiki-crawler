[[Image:2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Maldives tsunami wave.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''tsunami'' that struck [[Malé]] in the [[Maldives]] on [[December 26]], [[2004]].]]
A '''tsunami''' (pronounced {{IPA|/tsʊˈnɑːmi/}}) is a series of [[Ocean surface wave|waves]] created when a body of water, such as an [[ocean]], is rapidly displaced on a massive scale. [[Earthquake]]s, [[mass movement]]s above or below water, [[volcanic eruption]]s and other [[underwater explosion]]s, [[landslides]], large [[meteorite impact]]s and testing with [[nuclear weapon]]s at sea all have the potential to generate a tsunami.  The effects of a tsunami can range from unnoticeable to devastating.  
The term ''tsunami'' comes from the [[Japanese language|Japanese words]] meaning ''[[harbor]]'' ("tsu", [[wikt:津|津]]) and ''[[Ocean surface wave|wave]]'' ("nami", [[wikt:波|波]]).  Although in Japanese ''tsunami'' is used for both the singular and plural, in English ''tsunamis'' is often used as the plural. The term was created by fishermen who returned to port to find the area surrounding their [[harbor]] devastated, although they had not been aware of any [[Ocean surface wave|wave]] in the [[open water]].  ''Tsunami'' are common throughout [[Japanese history]]; approximately 195 events in Japan have been recorded.

A ''tsunami'' has a much smaller [[amplitude]] (wave height) offshore, and a very long [[wavelength]] (often hundreds of kilometers long), which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a passing "hump" in the ocean. ''Tsunami'' have been historically referred to as ''[[tidal wave]]s'' because as they approach land, they take on the characteristics of a violent onrushing [[tide]] rather than the sort of cresting waves that are formed by wind action upon the ocean (with which people are more familiar).  Since they are not actually related to tides the term is considered misleading and its usage is discouraged by [[oceanographer]]s.  [http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learning/topics/canit.php]  Since not all ''tsunami'' occur in harbors, however, that term is equally misleading, although it does have the benefit of being misleading in a different language.

== Causes ==
[[Image:Tsunami comic book style.png|right|thumb|Generation of a ''tsunami'']] 
A ''Tsunami'' can be generated when the [[sea floor]] abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water. Such large vertical movements of the Earth’s crust can occur at [[plate boundaries]]. [[Subduction]] earthquakes are particularly effective in generating ''tsunami''. 

Submarine [[landslide]]s (which are sometimes triggered by large earthquakes) as well as collapses of volcanic edifices may also disturb the overlying water column as sediment and rocks slide downslope and are redistributed across the sea floor. Similarly, a violent submarine volcanic eruption can uplift the water column and form a ''tsunami''.

''Tsunami'' are [[gravity wave|surface gravity waves]] that are formed as the displaced water mass moves under the influence of [[gravity]] and radiates across the ocean like ripples on a pond.

In the 1950s it was discovered that larger ''tsunami'' than previously believed possible could be caused by [[landslides]], explosive volcanic action, and [[impact event]]s. These phenomena rapidly displace large volumes of water, as energy from falling debris or expansion is transferred to the water into which the debris falls. ''Tsunami'' caused by these mechanisms, unlike the ocean-wide ''tsunami'' caused by some earthquakes, generally dissipate quickly and rarely affect coastlines distant from the source due to the small area of sea affected. These events can give rise to much larger local [[shock wave]]s ([[solitons]]), such as the landslide at the head of [[Lituya Bay]] which produced a water wave estimated at 50&nbsp;&ndash; 150&nbsp;m and reached 524&nbsp;m up local mountains. However, an extremely large landslide could generate a “[[megatsunami]]” that might have ocean-wide impacts.

The geological record tells us that there have been massive ''tsunami'' in Earth's past.  These ''tsunami'' were so large that they caused landslides on the opposite coast triggering another massive ''tsunami'', or "bounce back" ''tsunami''.  An example today would be a landslide equivalent to everything west of [[Portland, Oregon]] falling into the [[Pacific Ocean]], resulting in a ''tsunami'' that would then hit the Chinese coast with enough force to erode the coast, triggering a landslide large enough to send a ''tsunami'' that would in turn inundate the U.S. West Coast and would wipe out Portland.

== Signs of an approaching ''tsunami'' ==
There is often no advance warning of an approaching ''tsunami''. However, since earthquakes are often a cause of ''tsunami'', an earthquake felt near a body of water may be considered an indication that a ''tsunami'' will shortly follow. 

When the first part of a ''tsunami'' to reach land is a trough rather than a crest of the wave, the water along the shoreline may recede dramatically, exposing areas that are normally always submerged.  This can serve as an advance warning of the approach crest of the ''tsunami'', although the warning arrives only a very short time before the crest, which typically arrives seconds to minutes later.[http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tsunami/PNG/Upng/Davies020411/]
Although in the 2004 ''tsunami'' in the Indian Ocean the sea receding was not reported on the African coast or any other western coasts that it hit, when the ''tsunami'' approached from the east.

|}
''Tsunami'' cannot be prevented or precisely predicted, but there are some warning signs of an impending ''tsunami'', and there are many systems being developed and in use to reduce the damage from ''tsunami''.

In instances where the leading edge of the ''tsunami'' wave is its trough, the sea will recede from the coast half of the wave's period before the wave's arrival. If the slope is shallow, this recession can exceed many hundreds of meters. People unaware of the danger may remain at the shore due to curiosity, or for collecting fish from the exposed seabed.

[[Image:Kamakura_tsunami.jpg|left|200px|thumb|''Tsunami'' warning sign on [[seawall]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], Japan, 2004. In the [[Muromachi period]], a ''tsunami'' struck Kamakura, destroying the wooden building that housed the colossal statue of [[Amitabha|Amida]] [[Buddha]] at [[Kotokuin]]. Since that time, the statue has been outdoors.]]

Regions with a high risk of ''tsunami'' may use [[tsunami warning system|''tsunami'' warning systems]] to detect ''tsunami'' and warn the general population before the wave reaches land. In some communities on the west coast of the United States, which is prone to Pacific Ocean ''tsunami'', warning signs advise people where to run in the event of an incoming ''tsunami''.  [[Computer model]]s can roughly predict ''tsunami'' arrival and impact based on information about the event that triggered it and the shape of the seafloor ([[bathymetry]]) and coastal land ([[topography]]). [http://www.tsunami.noaa.gov/tsunami_story.html]

One of the early warnings comes from nearby animals. Many animals sense danger and flee to higher ground before the water arrives. The Lisbon quake is the first documented case of such a phenomenon in Europe. The phenomenon was also noted in [[Sri Lanka]] in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4381395.stm] Some scientists speculate that animals may have an ability to sense subsonic [[Rayleigh waves]] from an earthquake minutes or hours before a ''tsunami'' strikes shore (Kenneally, [http://www.slate.com/id/2111608]).

While it is not possible to prevent ''tsunami'', in some particularly ''tsunami''-prone countries some measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused on shore. Japan has implemented an extensive programme of building [[tsunami wall|''tsunami'' walls]] of up to 4.5 m (13.5 ft) high in front of populated coastal areas. Other localities have built floodgates and channels to redirect the water from incoming ''tsunami''. However, their effectiveness has been questioned, as ''tsunami'' are often higher than the barriers. For instance, the ''tsunami'' which struck the island of [[Hokkaidō]] on [[July 12]], [[1993]] created waves as much as 30 m (100 ft) tall - as high as a 10-story building. The port town of [[Aonae]] was completely surrounded by a ''tsunami'' wall, but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area. The wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of the ''tsunami'', but it did not prevent major destruction and loss of life.

The effects of a ''tsunami'' can be mitigated by natural factors such as tree cover on the shoreline. Some locations in the path of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami escaped almost unscathed as a result of the ''tsunami''’s energy being sapped by a belt of trees such as [[coconut palm]]s and [[mangrove]]s. In one striking example, the village of Naluvedapathy in India's [[Tamil Nadu]] region suffered minimal damage and few deaths as the wave broke up on a forest of 80,244 trees planted along the shoreline in 2002 in a bid to enter the [[Guinness Book of Records]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4269847.stm] Environmentalists have suggested tree planting along stretches of seacoast which are prone to ''tsunami'' risks. While it would take some years for the trees to grow to a useful size, such plantations could offer a much cheaper and longer-lasting means of ''tsunami'' mitigation than the costly and environmentally destructive method of erecting artificial barriers.

== Historical ''tsunami'' ==
''See also [[List of natural disasters by death toll#Tsunami|List of historic ''tsunami'' by death toll]].''

''Tsunami'' occur most frequently in the Pacific Ocean, but are a global phenomenon; they are possible wherever large bodies of water are found, including inland lakes, where they can be caused by landslides. Very small ''tsunami'', non-destructive and undetectable without specialized equipment, occur frequently as a result of minor earthquakes and other events. 

Japan is the nation with the most recorded ''tsunami'' in the world.  The earliest recorded disaster being that of the 684 A.D. [[Hakuho Earthquake]]. The number of ''tsunami'' in Japan totals 195 over a 1,313 year period, averaging one event every 6.7 years, the highest rate of occurrence in the world.  These waves have hit with such violent fury that entire towns have been destroyed. 
 
On [[December 26]], [[2004]], an undersea earthquake measuring 9.3 on the Earthquake Magnitude scale occurred 160&nbsp;km (100 mi) off the western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. It was the second largest earthquake in recorded history and generated massive tsunamis, which caused widespread devastation when they hit land, leaving an estimated 230,000 people dead in countries around the Indian Ocean

=== [[1700]] - [[Vancouver Island]], [[Canada]] ===
[[January 26]] - The [[Cascadia Earthquake]], one of the largest earthquakes on record (estimated MW 9 magnitude), ruptured the [[Cascadia subduction zone]] ([[Cascadia subduction zone|C]][[subduction zone|SZ]]) offshore from [[Vancouver Island]] to northern California, and caused massive ''tsunami'' across the [[Pacific Northwest]] logged in Japan and oral traditions of the Native Americans. [[Brian Atwater|Brian F. Atwater]], Musumi-Rokkaku Satoko, Satake Kenji, Tsuji Yoshinobu, Ueda Kazue, and David K. Yamaguch prepared a "scientific detective story" investigating this ''tsunami'' entitled ''The Orphan ''Tsunami'' of 1700—Japanese Clues to a Parent Earthquake in North America''. This document is downloadable and available [http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1707/ online].

=== [[1755]] - [[Lisbon, Portugal]] ===
Tens of thousands of Portuguese who survived the great '''[[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]''' on [[November 1]] were killed by a ''tsunami'' which followed a half hour later. Many townspeople fled to the waterfront, believing the area safe from fires and from falling debris from aftershocks. Before the great wall of water hit the harbour, waters retreated, revealing lost cargo and forgotten [[shipwreck]]s. 

The earthquake, ''tsunami'', and many forest fires killed more than 1,000 of Lisbon's pre-quake population of 275,000. Historical records of explorations by [[Vasco da Gama]] and other early navigators were lost, and countless buildings were destroyed (including most examples of Portugal's [[Manueline]] architecture). Europeans of the 18th century struggled to understand the disaster within [[religion|religious]] and [[rationality|rational]] belief systems. Philosophers of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], notably [[Voltaire]], wrote about the event. The [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], as described by philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in the ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'', took inspiration in part from attempts to comprehend the enormity of the Lisbon quake and ''tsunami''.

=== [[1771]] - [[Yaeyama Islands]], [[Okinawa]], Japan ===
An undersea earthquake of estimated magnitude 7.4 occurred near [[Yaeyama Islands]] in [[Okinawa]], [[Japan]] on [[4 April]], [[1771]] at about 8 [[ante meridiem|A.M.]]. The earthquake is not believed to have directly resulted in any deaths, but a resulting ''tsunami'' is thought to have killed about 12,000 people, (9313 on the Yaeyama Islands and 2548 on Miyako Islands according to one source([http://www3.pref.okinawa.jp/site/view/contview.jsp?cateid=41&id=3360&page=1]). Estimates of the highest seawater runup on [[Ishigaki Island]], range between 30 meters and 85.4 meters. The ''tsunami'' put an abrupt stop to population growth on the islands, and was followed by [[malaria]] epidemics and crop failures which decreased the population further. It was to be another 148 years before population returned to its pre-''tsunami'' level.

=== [[1792]] - ''Tsunami'' in [[Kyushu]], Japan caused by a collapsing [[volcano]] ===
Tsunami were the main cause of death for Japan's worst-ever volcanic disaster, due to an eruption of [[Mount Unzen]] in [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], [[Kyushu]], [[Japan]]. It began towards the end of 1791 as a series of earthquakes on the western flank of Mount Unzen which gradually moved towards Fugen-daké, one of Mount Unzen's peaks. In February 1792, Fugen-daké started to erupt, triggering a lava flow which continued for two months. Meanwhile, the earthquakes continued, shifting nearer to the city of [[Shimabara, Nagasaki|Shimabara]]. On the night of 21st May, two large earthquakes were followed by a collapse of the eastern flank of Mount Unzen's Mayuyama dome, causing an avelanche which swept through Shimabara and into Ariake Bay, triggering a ''tsunami''. It is not known to this day whether the collapse occurred as a result of an eruption of the dome or as a result of the earthquakes. The ''tsunami'' struck [[Higo Province]] on the other side of [[Ariake Bay]] before bouncing back and hitting Shimabara again. Out of an estimated total of 15,000 fatalities, around 5000 is thought to have been killed by the landslide, around 5000 by the ''tsunami'' across the bay in Higo Province, and a further 5000 by the ''tsunami'' returning to strike Shimabara.

=== [[1868]] - [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawai’ian]] local ''tsunami'' generated by [[earthquake]] ===
On [[April 2]], [[1868]], a local earthquake with a magnitude estimated between 7.25 and 7.75 rocked the southeast coast of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai’i]].  It triggered a landslide on the slopes of the [[Mauna Loa]] volcano, five miles north of [[Pahala]], killing 31 people.  A ''tsunami'' then claimed 46 additional lives.  The villages of [[Punaluu]], Ninole, Kawaa, Honuapo, and Keauhou Landing were severely damaged.  According to one account, the ''tsunami'' "rolled in over the tops of the cocoanut trees, probably 60 feet high .... inland a distance of a quarter of a mile in some places, taking out to sea when it returned, houses, men, women, and almost everything movable."  This was reported in the 1988 edition of Walter C. Dudley's book "''Tsunami''!" (ISBN 0-8248-1125-9).

=== [[1883]] - [[Krakatoa]] explosive eruption ===
The island volcano of '''[[Krakatoa]]''' in Indonesia exploded with devastating fury on August 26-27, 1883, blowing its underground [[magma]] chamber partly empty so that much overlying land and seabed collapsed into it. A series of large ''tsunami'' waves was generated from the collapse, some reaching a height of over 40&nbsp;meters above sea level. ''Tsunami'' waves were observed throughout the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Pacific Ocean]], the American West Coast, South America, and even as far away as the [[English Channel]]. On the facing coasts of [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]] the sea flood went many miles inland and caused such vast loss of life that one area was never resettled but went back to the [[jungle]] and is now the [[Ujung Kulon]] [[nature reserve]].

[[Image:Burnintsunami.jpg|thumb|250px|The aftermath of the ''tsunami'' that struck [[Newfoundland]] in [[1929]].]]

=== [[1896]] - Sanriku coast, Japan ===
On [[15 June]], [[1896]], at around 19:32 local time, a [[Richter scale|magnitude]] 8.5 undersea earthquake off the Sanriku coast of northeastern [[Honshu]], [[Japan]], triggered ''tsunami'' waves which struck the coast about half an hour later. Although the earthquake itself is not thought to have resulted in any fatalities, the waves, the highest recorded measurement of which reaching 38.2 meters, killed approximately 20,000 people.

=== [[1917]] - [[Halifax Explosion]] and ''tsunami'' ===
The [[Halifax Explosion]] occurred on Thursday, [[December 6]], [[1917]] at 9:04:35 A.M. local time in [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] in [[Canada]], when the French munitions ship ''Mont-Blanc'', bound for [[World War I]] France, collided with the Norwegian ship ''Imo'', chartered to carry Belgian relief supplies. In the aftermath of the collision, ''Mont-Blanc'' caught fire and [[explosion|exploded]]. The explosion caused a ''tsunami'', and a [[shock wave|pressure wave]] of air.

=== [[1923]] - [[Great Kanto Earthquake|The Great Kanto Earthquake]], Japan ===
The [[Great Kanto Earthquake]], which occurred in Eastern [[Japan]] on [[1 September]], [[1923]], and devastated [[Tokyo]], [[Yokohama]] and the surrounding areas, caused ''tsunami'' which struck the [[Shonan]] coast, [[Boso Peninsula]], [[Izu Islands]] and the east coast of [[Izu Peninsula]], within minutes in some cases. In [[Atami]], waves reaching 12 meters were recorded. Examples of ''tsunami'' damage include about 100 people killed along [[Yui-ga-hama]] beach in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and an estimated 50 people on the [[Enoshima]] causeway. However, ''tsunami'' only accounted for a small proportion of the final death toll of over 100,000, most of whom were killed in fire.

=== [[1929]] - [[Newfoundland]] ''tsunami'' ===
On [[November 18]], [[1929]], an [[1929 Grand Banks earthquake|earthquake of magnitude 7.2]] occurred beneath the [[Laurentian Slope]] on the [[Grand Banks]]. The quake was felt throughout the Atlantic Provinces of [[Canada]] and as far west as [[Ottawa]] and as far south as [[Claymont, Delaware]]. The resulting ''tsunami'' measured over 7 meters in height and took about 2½ hours to reach the [[Burin Peninsula]] on the south coast of [[Newfoundland]], where 29 people lost their lives in various communities. It also snapped telegraph lines laid under the Atlantic.

=== [[1933]] - Sanriku coast, Japan ===
On [[March 3]], [[1933]], the Sanriku coast of northeastern [[Honshu]], [[Japan]] which had already suffered a devastating ''tsunami'' in 1896 (see above) was again stuck by ''tsunami'' waves as a result of an offshore magnitude 8.1 earthquake. The quake destroyed about 5,000 homes and killed 3,068 people, the vast majority as a result of ''tsunami'' waves. Especially hard hit was the coastal village of Taro (now part of [[Miyako, Iwate|Miyako city]]) in [[Iwate Prefecture]], which lost 42% of its total population and 98% of its buildings. Taro is now protected by an enormous ''tsunami'' wall, currently 10 meters in height and over 2 kilometers long. The original [[seawall|wall]], constructed in 1958, saved Taro from yet another destruction from the 1960 Chilean ''tsunami'' (see below).

=== [[1944]] - Tonankai Earthquake, Japan ===
A magnitude 8.0 earthquake on [[7 December]], [[1944]], about 20 km off the  [[Shima Peninsula]] in [[Japan]], caused ''tsunami'' which struck the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of central Japan, mainly [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]s. News of the event was downplayed by the authorities in order to protect [[World War II|wartime]] [[morale]], and as a result the full extent of the damage is not known, but the quake is estimated to have killed 1223 people, ''tsunami'' being the leading cause of fatalities.

=== [[1946]] - Nankai Earthquake, Japan ===
The Nankai earthquake, a periodic earthquake of around magnitude 8.0 which occurs off the southern coast of [[Kii Peninsula]] and [[Shikoku]], Japan every 100 to 150 years, last struck on [[21 December]], [[1946]]. The resulting ''tsunami'' hit the Pacific coast of western Japan. Particularly hard hit were the coastal towns of [[Kushimoto, Wakayama|Kushimoto]] and [[Kainan, Wakayama|Kainan]] on the Kii Peninsula. The quake led to more than 1400 deaths, ''tsunami'' being the leading cause.

=== 1946 - Pacific ''tsunami'' ===
[[Image:Tsunami large.jpg|thumb|250px|Residents run from an approaching ''tsunami'' in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo, Hawai’i]]]]
The [[April 1]] '''[[Aleutian Island earthquake]]''' ''tsunami'' that killed 159 people on [[Hawaii]] and five in [[Alaska]] (the [[lighthouse]] keepers at the [[Scotch Cap Light]] in the Aleutians) resulted in the creation of a [[tsunami warning system|''tsunami'' warning system]] (specifically The [[Pacific Tsunami Warning Center|PTWC]]), established in 1949 for [[Pacific Ocean]] area countries. The tsunami is locally known in Hawaii as the '''[[April Fools Day]] ''Tsunami''''' in Hawaii due to people thinking the warnings were an April Fools prank.

=== [[1958]] - [[Lituya Bay]] [[Megatsunami]] ===
In 1958 an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.3 on the [[Richter scale]] rocked a small inlet of [[Alaska]] called Lituya Bay. It then caused part of a mountain at the back of the bay to collapse causing a monstrous ''tsunami'' (an [[Megatsunami|''iminami'']]) to fly headlong through the bay. At a mountain at the mouth of the bay the run was measured to be 524m (1740ft) making it the largest wave in recorded history. It swept up three boats, one managed to ride the wave but the other two were swept into the [[Pacific Ocean]], where they were completely destroyed and four people aboard them were killed.

=== [[1960]] - [[Chile]]an ''tsunami'' ===
The magnitude 9.5 '''[[Great Chilean Earthquake]]''' of [[May 22]], [[1960]] is the strongest earthquake ever recorded. Its [[epicenter]], off the coast of South Central [[Chile]], generated one of the most destructive ''tsunami'' of the [[20th Century]]. 

It spread across the entire Pacific Ocean, with waves measuring up to 25 meters high. The first ''tsunami'' arrived at [[Hilo, Hawai'i|Hilo]] approximately 14.8 hrs after it originated off the coast of South Central Chile. The highest wave at Hilo Bay was measured at around 10.7 m (35 ft.). 61 lives were lost allegedly due to people's failure to heed warning sirens. 

Almost 22 hours after the quake, the waves hit the ill-fated Sanriku coast of Japan, reaching up to 3 m above high tide, and killed 142 people.

Up to 6,000 people died in total worldwide due to the earthquake and ''tsunami''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.em-dat.net|accessdate=2006-05-30|publisher=CRED|title="Emergency & Disasters Data Base"}}</ref>

=== [[1964]] - [[Good Friday Earthquake|Good Friday]] ''tsunami'' ===
After the magnitude 9.2 '''[[Good Friday Earthquake]]''' (Friday, [[March 27]], [[1964]]), ''tsunami'' struck [[Alaska]], [[British Columbia]], [[California]], and coastal [[Pacific Northwest]] towns, killing 121 people.  The ''tsunami'' were up to 23 m tall, and killed 11 people as far away as [[Crescent City, California]].

=== [[1976]] - [[Moro Gulf]] ''tsunami'' ===
On [[August 16]], [[1976]] at 12:11 A.M., a devastating earthquake of 7.9 hit the island of [[Mindanao]], [[Philippines]]. It created a ''tsunami'' that devastated more than 700 km of coastline bordering Moro Gulf in the [[North Celebes Sea]]. An estimated number of victims for this tragedy left 5,000 dead, 2,200 missing or presumed dead, more than 9,500 injured and a total of 93,500 people were left homeless. It devastated the cities of [[Cotabato City|Cotabato]], [[Pagadian City|Pagadian]], and [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], and the and provinces of [[Basilan]], [[Lanao del Norte]], [[Lanao del Sur]], [[Maguindanao]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Sulu]], and [[Zamboanga del Sur]].

=== [[1979]] - [[Tumaco]] ''tsunami'' ===
A magnitude 7.9 earthquake occurred on [[December 12]], [[1979]] at 7:59:4.3 [[UTC]] along the Pacific coast of [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]]. The earthquake and the resulting ''tsunami'' caused the destruction of at least six fishing villages and the death of hundreds of people in the Colombian province of [[Nariño Department|Nariño]]. The earthquake was felt in [[Bogotá]], [[Cali]], [[Popayán]], [[Buenaventura]], and several other cities and towns in Colombia and in [[Guayaquil]], [[Esmeraldas (city)|Esmeraldas]], [[Quito]], and other parts of Ecuador. When the '''Tumaco ''Tsunami''''' hit the coast, it caused huge destruction in the city of [[Tumaco]], as well as in the small towns of El Charco, San Juan, Mosquera, and Salahonda on the Pacific coast of Colombia. The total number of victims of this tragedy was 259 dead, 798 wounded and 95 missing or presumed dead.

=== [[1983]] - [[Sea of Japan]] ''tsunami'' ===
On [[May 6]], [[1983]] at 11:59:57 local time, a magnitude-7.7 earthquake occurred in the [[Sea of Japan]], about 100 km west of the coast of [[Noshiro, Akita|Noshiro]] in [[Akita Prefecture]], [[Japan]].  Out of the 107 fatalities, all but four were killed by the resulting ''tsunami'', which struck communities along the coast, especially [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]] and [[Akita Prefecture]]s and the east coast of [[Noto Peninsula]]. Footage of the ''tsunami'' hitting the fishing harbor of [[Wajima]] on Noto Peninsula was broadcast on TV. The waves exceeded 10 meters in some areas. Three of the fatalities were along the east coast of [[South Korea]] (whether [[North Korea]] was affected is not known). 

=== [[1993]] - [[Okushiri]] ''tsunami'' ===
[[Image:1993 Okushiri EB NHK.jpg|frame|right|Map of [[Hokkaidō]] shown on [[NHK]] during an emergency broadcast.]]A devastating ''tsunami'' occurred off the coast of [[Hokkaidō]] in Japan as a result of a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, 80 miles offshore, on [[July 12]], [[1993]]. 
Within minutes, the [[Japan Durka Durka Agency]] issued a ''tsunami'' warning which was broadcast on [[NHK]] in English and Japanese (archived at [[YouTube]][http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCgFjjDWJ3w]). However, this was too late for the small island of [[Okushiri, Hokkaido|Okushiri]] near the epicenter, which was struck with extremely big waves, some reaching 30 meters, within 2 to 5 minutes after the quake. The village of Aonae at the southern tip of the island, which is surrounded by the sea in three directions, was devastated over the course of the next hour by a total of 13 waves over 2 meters high coming from multiple directions, including waves which had bounced back off Hokkaidō, despite being surrounded by ''tsunami'' barriers. Out of the 250 people killed as a result of the quake, 197 of them were killed by the ''tsunami'' on Okushiri;  the waves also caused deaths on the coast of Hokkaidō. While many residents, remembering the 1983 ''tsunami'' (see above) ten years previous, survived by quickly evacuating on foot to higher ground, it is thought that many others underestimated how soon the waves would arrive (the 1983 ''tsunami'' took 17 [[minute]]s to hit Okushiri) and were killed as they attempted to evacuate by car along the village's narrow lanes. The highest wave of the tsunami was a staggering 31m (about 93ft) tall.

=== [[1998]] - [[Papua New Guinea]] ===
On [[17 July]], [[1998]], a [[Papua New Guinea]] ''tsunami'' killed approximately 2200 people [http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/tsunami/PNG.html]. A 7.1 magnitude earthquake 24 km offshore was followed within 11 minutes by a ''tsunami'' about 12 m tall. While the magnitude of the quake was not large enough to create these waves directly, it is believed the earthquake generated an undersea landslide, which in turn caused the ''tsunami''. The villages of Arop and Warapu were destroyed.

=== [[2004]] - [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Indian Ocean ''tsunami'']] ===
The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], which had a [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] of 9.3, triggered a series of lethal ''tsunami'' on [[December 26]], [[2004]] that killed approximately 300,000 people (including 168,000 in Indonesia alone), making it the deadliest ''tsunami'' as well as one of the [[List of natural disasters by death toll|deadliest natural disasters]] in recorded history. It also had the second largest earthquake in recorded history. The initial surge was measured at a height of aproximately 108 feet, making it the largest earthquake-generated tsunami in recorded history. The ''tsunami'' killed people over an area ranging from the immediate vicinity of the [[epicenter|quake]] in [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]] and the northwestern coast of [[Malaysia]] to thousands of kilometers away in [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Maldives]], and even as far away as [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]], and [[Tanzania]] in eastern [[Africa]]. 

Unlike in the [[Pacific Ocean]], there was no organized alert service covering the [[Indian Ocean]]. This was in part due to the absence of major ''tsunami'' events since 1883 (the [[Krakatoa]] eruption, which killed 36,000 people). In light of the 2004 [[Indian Ocean]] tsunami, [[UNESCO]] and other world bodies have called for a international [[tsunami warning system|''tsunami'' monitoring system]].

=== [[2006]] - South of [[Java Island]] ''tsunami'' ===
A 7.7 [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] earthquake rocked the Indian Ocean seabed on [[July 17]],[[2006]], 200&nbsp;km south of [[Pangandaran]], a beautiful beach famous to surfers for its perfect waves. This earthquake triggered ''tsunami'' whose heights varied from 2 meters at [[Cilacap]] to 6 meters at [[Cimerak]] beach, where it swept away and flattened buildings as far as 400 meters away from the coastline. More than 600 people were reported killed, with around 150 others still missing. See [[July 2006 Java earthquake]].

=== 2006 - [[Kuril Islands]] ''tsunami'' ===
On [[November 15]] 2006, an 8.1 magnitude quake struck an area claimed by both [[Russia]] and Japan, but the waves near Japan did not swell higher than 23 inches. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Six hours later, ''tsunami'' waves up to nearly 5 feet high caused by the quake crashed into [[Crescent City, California]] and [[Santa Cruz, California]] causing considerable damage. See [[2006 Kuril Islands tsunami|2006 Kuril Islands ''tsunami'']].

=== 2006 - [[Crescent City, California]] ''tsunami'' ===
On [[November 15]] 2006  according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], an 8.3 magnitude earthquake struck off coast of the Kuril´sk, Kuril Islands, about 1,000 miles northeast of [[Japan]].  The quake triggered a tsunami that struck the [[Pacific Northwest]]. There were no fatalities.  The resulting tsunami did cause approximately $700,000 in damage to [[Crescent City]], [[California]]'s harbor.  The quake sent a wave surge of 5-6 feet.  The ''tsunami'' struck five hours after warnings had been lifted and an initial wave of 3-5 feet struck earlier in the morning.  Surges also struck [[Santa Cruz, California]].

=== European ''tsunami'' ===
* [[6100 BC]] - [[Storegga Slide]], [[Norway]]
* [[16 October]] [[1979]] - 23 people died when the coast of [[Nice]], [[France]], was hit by a ''tsunami''. This may have had a man-made cause:  construction at the new Nice airport creating an undersea landslide. [http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(v5vg3l2tc4kfq2m223kj2l45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,3,4;journal,18,26;linkingpublicationresults,1:102476,1] [http://www.azurseisme.com/Tsunamis.htm] [http://www.lamouettelaurentine.com/st_laurent_du_var/port/tsunami.htm] [http://cdf.u-3mrs.fr/~lepichon/2006col_fichiers/livret.pdf]

=== Other historical ''tsunami'' ===
Other ''tsunami'' that have occurred include the following:
* ca. 1600 B.C.: The Israelite [[The Exodus|crossing of the Red Sea]] has been linked by some researchers to a ''tsunami'' following the volcanic explosion of the Greek island of [[Santorini]].
* ca. 500 B.C.: [[Poompuhar]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], [[Maldives]]
* ca. 450 B.C.: The Greek historian [[Thucydides]] in his book ''History of the Peloponnesian Wars'', speculated about the causes of ''tsunami''. He argued that it could only be explained as a consequence of ocean earthquakes, and could see no other possible causes for the phenomenon.
* 1541: a ''tsunami'' struck the earliest European settlement in Brazil, [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]]. There is no record of deaths or injuries, but the town was almost completely destroyed.
* [[January 20]], [[1606]]/[[1607]]: along the coast of the [[Bristol Channel]] thousands of people were drowned, houses and villages swept away, farmland was inundated and flocks were destroyed by a flood that might have been a tsunami. The cause of the flood remains disputed, it is quite possible that it was caused by a combination of [[meteorology|meteorological extremes]] and [[tide|tidal peaks]].([http://www.severnsolutions.co.uk/twblog/archive/2005/01/06/greatflood1606 ''discussion'']).
* [[July 9]], [[1958]]: A huge [[landslip]] caused a ''tsunami'' in the [[fjörd]]-shaped [[Lituya Bay]], [[Alaska]], [[United States|USA]]. It traveled at over 150 [[kilometers per hour|km/h]].  It was the world’s tallest recorded ''tsunami'' at 524 m (1719 ft).
