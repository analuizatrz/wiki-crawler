The '''International Criminal Court''' ('''ICC''') was established in 2002 as a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and the [[crime of aggression]], although it cannot currently exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression.  The court can only prosecute crimes committed on or after [[July 1]] [[2002]], the date its founding treaty, the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], entered into force.

104 states are currently [[State Parties of the International Criminal Court|members of the Court]], and a further 41 countries have signed but not [[ratification|ratified]] the Rome Statute. However, a number of states, including the [[United States]], [[China]] and [[India]], continue to oppose it.  

The Court can generally only exercise jurisdiction in cases where the accused is a national of a state party, the alleged crime took place on the territory of a state party, or a situation is referred to the Court by the [[United Nations Security Council]].  The Court is designed to complement existing national judicial systems: it can only exercise its jurisdiction when national courts are unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute such crimes.  Primary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction over suspected criminals is therefore left to individual states.

The official seat of the ICC is in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], but its proceedings may take place anywhere.  The Court is separate from, and should not be confused with, the [[International Court of Justice]] (often referred to as the “World Court”), which is the [[United Nations]] organ that settles disputes between nations.

"International Criminal Court" is sometimes abbreviated as ICCt to distinguish it from [[ICC|several other organizations abbreviated as ICC]]. However, the more common abbreviation "ICC" is used in this article.

==History==
===Early development===
The movement for the creation of an international court to deal with the problem of crimes committed against humanity gained force after the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo Trials]], established to punish serious crimes committed by the losing sides during [[World War II]].  At the request of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the [[International Law Commission]] drafted two draft statutes by the early 1950s, but these were shelved as the [[Cold War]] made the establishment of an international criminal court politically unrealistic.<ref name="Cato">Gary T. Dempsey, 16 July 1998. [http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-311es.html ''Reasonable Doubt: The Case Against the Proposed International Criminal Court''].  The Cato Institute.  Accessed 31 December 2006.</ref>

Then [[Prime Minister]] [[A. N. R. Robinson]] of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] revived the idea during the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly in [[1989]], proposing the creation of a permanent international court to deal with the international drug trade.<ref name="Cato"/>  While work began on a draft statute, the international community created several ''[[ad hoc]]'' tribunals to try war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda ([[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] in [[1993]], [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] in 1994), further highlighting the need for a permanent international criminal court.<ref>Coalition for the International Criminal Court. [http://www.iccnow.org/?mod=icchistory ''History of the ICC'']. Accessed 2006-12-31.</ref>

===Adoption and entry into force of the Rome Statute===
Following years of negotiations, the General Assembly convened a conference in Rome, Italy, in June 1998, with the aim of finalising a treaty.  On [[July 17]] [[1998]], the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted by a vote of 120 to 7, with 21 countries abstaining.  The seven countries that voted against the treaty were [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Libya]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Qatar]], the [[United States]], and [[Yemen]].<ref>Michael P. Scharf,  August 1998. [http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh23.htm ''Results of the Rome Conference for an International Criminal Court'']. The American Society of International Law. Accessed 2006-12-04.</ref>

The Rome Statute became a binding treaty at the moment 60 states had ratified it, an event ceremonialized at the United Nations Headquarters on [[April 11]], [[2002]]. Ten countries submitted their ratifications at this time, bringing the total to 66, so that no one nation would hold the honor of depositing the 60th ratification.  The ICC legally came into existence on [[July 1]], [[2002]], and can only prosecute crimes committed after that date. 

The first bench of 18 judges was elected by an Assembly of State Parties in February 2003.  They were sworn in at the inaugural session of the Court on [[March 11]], [[2003]].<ref>Coalition for the International Criminal Court.

==Jurisdiction==
===Crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court===
Article 5 of the Rome Statute grants the Court jurisdiction over four groups of crimes, which it refers to as the “''most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole''”: the crime of [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and the [[crime of aggression]].  The statute defines each of these crimes except for aggression: it provides that the Court will not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the state parties agree on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it may be prosecuted.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 5] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>

Many states wanted to add [[terrorism]] and [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] to the list of crimes covered by the Rome Statute; however, states were unable to agree a definition for terrorism and it was decided not to include drug trafficking as this might overwhelm the Court's limited resources.<ref>United Nations Department of Public Information, December 2002. [http://www.un.org/News/facts/iccfact.htm ''The International Criminal Court''].

Article 123 of the Rome Statute provides that a Review Conference shall be convened in 2009, and that this conference may review the list of crimes contained in Article 5.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/13.htm Article 123] of the Rome Statute.

===Territorial jurisdiction===
During the negotiations that led to the Rome Statute, a large number of states argued that the Court should be allowed to exercise [[universal jurisdiction]].  However, this proposal was defeated due in large part to opposition from the United States.<ref>Elizabeth Wilmhurst, 1999. ‘Jurisdiction of the Court’, p. 136.  In Roy S Lee (ed.), ''The International Criminal Court: The Making of the Rome Statute''.  The Hague: Kluwer Law International. ISBN 90-411-1212-X.</ref>  A compromise was reached, allowing the Court to exercise its jurisdiction only under certain limited circumstances, namely: 

#Where the person accused of committing a crime is a national of a state party (or where the person's state has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court);  or
#Where the alleged crime was committed on the territory of a state party (or where the state on whose territory the crime was committed has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court); or 
#Where a situation is referred to the Court by the UN Security Council.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Articles 12 & 13] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>

===Temporal jurisdiction===
The Court's jurisdiction does not apply retroactively: it can only prosecute crimes committed on or after 1 July 2002  (the date on which the Rome Statute entered into force).  Where a state becomes party to the Rome Statute after that date, the Court can exercise jurisdiction automatically with respect to crimes committed after the statute enters into force for that state.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 11] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>

===Complementarity===
The Court is intended as a court of last resort, investigating and prosecuting only where national courts have failed.  Article 17 of the Statute provides that a case is inadmissible if:

:‘(a)     The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;

:(b)     The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of the State genuinely to prosecute;

:(c)     The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;

:(d)     The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court.’<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 17] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-12-04.</ref>

Article 20, paragraph 3, specifies that, if a person has already been tried by another court, the ICC cannot try them again for the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:

:‘(a)     Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court; or

:(b)     Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.’<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 20] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-12-04.</ref>

==Structure==
[[Image:ICC.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The International Criminal Court in The Hague]]
===Composition of the court===
{{main|Judges of the International Criminal Court}}

The International Criminal Court comprises four organs: the Presidency, the Judicial Divisions (the Pre-Trial Division, the Trial Division and the Appeals Division), the Office of the Prosecutor, and the Registry.<ref>International Criminal Court. [http://www.icc-cpi.int/about/ataglance/structure.html ''Structure of the Court'']. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>

The court consists of 18 judges, all of whom are nationals of States Parties to the Rome Statute. They must be “persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective States for appointment to the highest judicial offices”. Each judge is elected by States Parties for a term of up to nine years.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/4.htm Article 36] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>

The President of the court is [[Philippe Kirsch]] of Canada. The Chief Prosecutor is [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]] of Argentina.

===How cases reach the court===
There are four methods by which a case may reach the ICC:<ref>[[Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal]]. [http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/new_links/icc.htm ''The International Criminal Court — Its Role, Tasks and Performance''].  Supreme Court of India.  Accessed 31 December 2006.</ref>

#A state party refers the case;
#A country that has chosen to accept the Court's jurisdiction refers the case;
#The United Nations Security Council refers the case; or
#The three-judge panel authorizes a case initiated by the ICC Prosecutor.

===Relationship with the United Nations===
Unlike the [[International Court of Justice]], the ICC is legally and functionally independent from the United Nations.  Nonetheless, the Rome Statute grants the UN a clear role in relation to the Court.  The Security Council may refer to the Court cases that would not otherwise fall under the Court's jurisdiction (as it did in relation to the situation in [[Darfur]], which the Court could not otherwise have prosecuted as [[Sudan]] is not a state party).  Article 16 of the Rome Statute also allows the Security Council to require the Court to defer from investigating a case for a period of 12 months.<ref name="Article 16">[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 16] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>  Such a deferral may be renewed indefinitely by the Security Council.

The Court cooperates with the UN in many different areas, including the exchange of information and logistical support.<ref name="un&icc">International Criminal Court, 1 February 2007.

==Victim participation and reparations==
The Rome Statute provides for an unprecedented level of victim participation in the proceedings of ICC cases and situations. For example, Article 43(6) establishes a Victims and Witnesses Unit within the court's Registry, with the mandate of providing "protective measures and security arrangements, counseling and other appropriate assistance for witnesses, victims who appear before the Court, and others who are at risk on account of testimony given by such witnesses."<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/4.htm Article 43(6)] of the Rome Statute.

==Criticisms of the Court==
===Potential for politically motivated prosecutions===
Opponents of the Court argue that there are “insufficient checks and balances on the authority of the ICC prosecutor and judges” and “insufficient protection against politicized prosecutions or other abuses”.<ref name="US DoS faq">US Department of State, 30 July 2003.

===Lack of due process===
Many American critics of the Court, such as the [[Heritage Foundation]], claim that “Americans who appear before the court would be denied such basic constitutional rights as trial by a jury of one's peers, protection from double jeopardy, and the right to confront one's accusers.”<ref name="Heritage">Brett D.

However, [[Human Rights Watch]] argues that “the ICC has one of the most extensive lists of due process guarantees ever written”, including “presumption of innocence; right to counsel; right to present evidence and to confront witnesses; right to remain silent; right to be present at trial; right to have charges proved beyond a reasonable doubt; and protection against double jeopardy”.<ref>Human Rights Watch.

===Interference with national reconciliation processes===
In the past, governments have granted amnesty to human rights abusers as part of agreements to end conflict.  It is sometimes argued that these amnesties are necessary to allow the peaceful transfer of power from abusive regimes.  By denying states the right to offer amnesty to human rights abusers, the International Criminal Court may make it more difficult to negotiate an end to conflict and a transition to democracy.

It is worth noting, however, that the United Nations,<ref>See, for example, Kofi Annan, 4 October 2000.  [http://www.afrol.com/Countries/Sierra_Leone/documents/un_sil_court_041000.htm ''Report of the Secretary-General on the establishment of a Special Court for Sierra Leone''], para. 22.

ISBN 0521005280</ref> and others maintain that granting amnesty to those accused of war crimes and other serious crimes is a violation of international law.  Moreover, Article 16 of the Rome Statute allows the Security Council to prevent the Court from investigating or prosecuting a case,<ref name="Article 16"/> and Article 53 allows the Prosecutor the discretion not to initiate an investigation if he or she believes that “an investigation would not serve the interests of justice”.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/5.htm Article 53] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-12-31.</ref>  These provisions may allow the Court some leeway to respect national reconciliation processes.

===Crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court===
As noted above, some states were unhappy about the exclusion of [[terrorism]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] and the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] from the Court's jurisdiction.  The government of India, for example, expressed concern that “the Statute of the ICC lays down, by clear implication, that the use of weapons of mass destruction is not a war crime. This is an extraordinary message to send to the international community.”<ref name="India"/>

At the same time, other commentators have argued that the Rome Statute defines crimes too broadly or too vaguely.  For example, China has argued that the definition of ‘war crimes’ goes beyond that accepted under customary international law.<ref>Lu Jianping and Wang Zhixiang. “China's Attitude Towards the ICC” in ''Journal of International Criminal Justice'', July 2005.</ref>

==Opposition to the Court==
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2006}}
While over 50% of the world's states are members of the Court, the majority of the population of the world is outside the jurisdiction of the court and a number of significant countries continue to oppose it.

===The United States===
{{main|United States and the International Criminal Court}}

Although the US originally voted against the adoption of the Rome Statute, President [[Bill Clinton]] unexpectedly reversed his position on [[December 31]] [[2000]] and signed the treaty,<ref>Amnesty International. [http://web.amnesty.org/pages/icc-US_threats-eng ''US Threats to the International Criminal Court''].

Accessed 2006-03-05.</ref>

The country's main objections are interference with their national sovereignty and a fear of politically motivated prosecutions.

In 2002, the U.S. Congress passed the [[American Servicemembers' Protection Act]] (ASPA), which contained a number of provisions, including prohibitions on the U.S. providing military aid to countries which had ratified the treaty establishing the court (exceptions granted), and permitting the President to authorize military force to free any U.S. military personnel held by the court, leading opponents to dub it the "Hague Invasion Act." The act was later modified to permit U.S. cooperation with the ICC when dealing with U.S. enemies.

The U.S. has also made a number of Bilateral Immunity Agreements (BIAs, also known as "Article 98 Agreements") with a number of countries, prohibiting the surrender to the ICC of a broad scope of persons including current or former government officials, military personnel, and U.S. employees (including non-national contractors) and nationals. As of [[August 2]] [[2006]], the US Department of State reported that it had signed 101 of these agreements.<ref name="BIAs">Coalition for the International Criminal Court, 2006. [http://www.iccnow.org/documents/CICCFS_BIAstatusCurrent.pdf ''Status of US Bilateral Immunity Acts'']. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref> The United States has cut aid to many countries which have refused to sign BIAs.<ref name="BIAs"/>

In 2002, the United States threatened to veto the renewal of all United Nations [[peacekeeping]] missions unless its troops were granted immunity from prosecution by the Court.<ref name=res1422>Human Rights Watch, ''[http://hrw.org/campaigns/icc/docs/1422legal.htm The ICC and the Security Council: Resolution 1422]''. Accessed 2007-01-11.</ref> In a compromise move, the Security Council passed [[UN Security Council Resolution 1422|Resolution 1422]] on [[July 12]] [[2002]], granting immunity to personnel from ICC non-states parties involved in United Nations established or authorized missions for a renewable twelve-month period.<ref name=res1422/> This was renewed for twelve months in 2003 but the Security Council refused to renew the exemption again in 2004, after pictures  emerged of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|US troops abusing Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib]], and the US withdrew its demand.<ref>BBC News, 20 March 2006.

===Israel===
[[Israel]] states that it has "deep sympathy" with the goals of the court. However, it has concerns that political pressure on the court would lead it to reinterpret international law or to "invent new crimes". It cites the inclusion of "the transfer of parts of the civilian population of an occupying power into occupied territory" as a war crime as an example of this, whilst at the same time disagrees with the exclusion of terrorism and drug trafficking. Israel sees the powers given to the prosecutor as excessive and the geographical appointment of judges as disadvantaging Israel which is not part of any of the [[UN Regional Groups]].<ref>Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 30 June 2002. [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/6/Israel%20and%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court ''Israel and the International Criminal Court'']. Accessed 2002-06-30.</ref>

Israel voted against the adoption of the [[Rome Statute]] but later signed the Statute. In 2002 it submitted a letter to the United Nations declaring that it did not intend to ratify the treaty, using the same wording as the similar letter from the United States.<ref>The American Non-Governmental Organizations Coalition for the International Criminal Court.
