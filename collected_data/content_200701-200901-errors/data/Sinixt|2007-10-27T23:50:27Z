The '''Sinixt'''<ref>"Sinixt Nation…"</ref> (also known as the '''Sin-Aikst''' or '''Sin Aikst''',<ref>Reyes 2002, ''passim.''</ref> "'''Arrow Lakes Band'''"<ref>"Sinixt Nation…"</ref> or—most commonly in recent decades—simply as "'''The Lakes'''"<ref>Paula Pryce, ''Keeping the Lakes' way: reburial and the re-creation of a moral world among an invisible people''University of Toronto Press, 1999. ISBN: 0802044190. ''passim.''</ref>) are a [[First Nation]]s People. Historically, they lived primarily in what are today the [[West Kootenay]] region of [[British Columbia]] in [[Canada]] and the adjacent regions of Eastern [[Washington]] in the [[United States]]. The Sinixt are of [[Salishan language|Salishan linguistic extraction]], and their own dialect is similar to [[Colville language|Colville]] and [[Okanagan language|Okanagan]] variations.

Today they live primarily on the [[Colville Indian Reservation]] in Washington, where they form part of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which is recognized by the United States government as an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian Tribe]]. A few Sinixt live in their traditional West Kootenay territory, particularly the [[Slocan Valley]]. They are not recognized by the Canadian government.

==History==
The history of the Sinixt is long and complex.  

===Traditional life===
Traditional Sinixt territory was centred in the [[Slocan Valley]] and the Lower [[Arrow Lakes]], and also included the lower [[Kootenay River]], and the [[Columbia River]] from the "Big Bend" north of Revelstoke to just above (and often including) [[Kettle Falls]] in the south, as well as along the [[Kettle River (Columbia River)|Kettle River]], a tributary of the Columbia.

According to [[Lawney Reyes]], the Sinixt numbered about 3,000 in the early 19th century,<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 25.</ref> divided into several bands of sizes suited to hunting and fishing. He distinguishes the "Upper Sin-Aikst" around the Arrow Lakes, "above [[Revelstoke, British Columbia|Revelstoke]] and around the [[Castlegar, British Columbia|Castlegar]], [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], and Slocan Valley area" from the "Lower Sin-Aikst in the [[Northport, Washington|Northport]], [[Bossburg, Washington|Bossburg]], [[Marcus, Washington|Marcus]], and Kettle Falls area in Washington State." The latter constituted "at least eight large bands". Once they obtained [[horse]]s, they ranged farther east to hunt on the [[Great Plains]].<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 8, 45.</ref>

In prehistoric times, the Sinixt were a semi-sedentary people, living in warm, [[pit-house|semi-subterranean house]]s for the winter months. Summers were spent managing fishing, hunting, and other food resources in their mountain and lake-dominated homeland. Reyes says that they wintered in the more wind-sheltered valleys, but summered by the Columbia.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 15.</ref> Scholars have classified the Sinixt as "[[complex collectors]]" (as opposed, for example, to "[[hunter-gatherers]]"). 

Early white explorers reported the Sinixt to be of average height and size, with [[Eye color#Hazel|hazel]] eyes, adept in making suspended bridges over the narrow, swift-flowing Columbia, and skillful at fishing.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 14.</ref>

Their staples included [[huckleberry]], [[salmon]], and roots ([[Camassia|camas]], [[bitterroot]]), but they also ate [[black moss]], other berries ([[serviceberry]], [[gooseberry]], and [[foam berry]]), [[hazelnut]]s, wild [[carrot]]s, [[peppermint]], and various game meats ([[deer]], [[elk]], [[moose]], [[caribou]], [[rabbit]], [[mountain sheep]], [[mountain goat]], and [[bear]]; after the coming of the horse, they also ventured east after [[bison]]). They chewed [[pine]] [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] like gum, and had a range of herbal medicines. Starting in June, mature salmon arrived at Kettle Falls, the farthest their territory extended down the river. The Sinixt approach to fishing caught only the salmon that were not strong enough to clear the falls, ensuring that only the strongest went on to [[Spawning|spawn]]. Both bands traveled to [[Red Mountain (Rossland)|Red Mountain]] near Rossland, B.C. to harvest huckleberries in August. Both of these events figured prominently in their culture. They hunted in late autumn, but still often were short on food in late winter.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 15–18.</ref> 

The Upper Sin Aikst trained dogs to drive deer toward the Columbia, where hunters in [[canoe]]s shot them with [[bow and arrow]]. Their canoes were somewhat unusual, about 15–17 feet (4.5–5 meters) long with a [[cedar]] frame covered by large slabs of pine bark, riding low in the water with downward-sloping tips to reduce wind resistance.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 18.</ref> 

The Sin Aikst used the distinctive [[Sturgeon-nosed canoe]] for water transportation in their territory.

Reyes says that they intermarried with the Swhy-ayl-puh ([[Colville (tribe)|Colville]]), who had a very similar language; the territory of the latter was largely in the [[Colville River (Washington)|Colville]] Valley and intersected Sinaixt territory at Kettle Falls.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 8–9.</ref>

Reyes gives an account of various Sinixt customs, especially related to pregnancy, birth, and education, as well as some descriptions of funerary customs. Children were "closely monitored" by elders. Children were sent on "short excursions" to search for protective spirits; they were usually required to bring back an object to prove that they had actually made the journey. As they grew older, until puberty, these journeys became longer. Each person was expected to acquire multiple spirits, because each had different powers.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 11–12, 25.</ref>

At about the age of six, they began to be instructed in "the legends of the tribe and family history…, tribal ways and tribal laws." At eight or nine, they learned to swim and to run long distances; boys were taught to make and use weapons and fishing gear, while girls started to learn plant lore and tanning, as well as how to care for young children, maintain dwellings, and prepare meals.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 11–12.</ref>

Sinixt religion was mainly "for harnessing power." The sun, the stars, the water, and the different animals (especially the [[salmon]] and [[coyote]]) each had different powers.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 13.</ref>

The whole tribe was led by one head [[chief]] (ilmi wm), but each smaller village of 50-200 had a local chief, whom they called a "thinker". These "thinkers" would come together to form a council.<ref>Pearkes 2002, p. 11.</ref>

The Sinixt were a [[Matrilocal]] people, with next generations chosing to reside with the wife's family rather than the husband's.<ref>Pearkes 2002, p. 11.</ref>

===Late Precontact smallpox/instability===
There is historic evidence suggesting that the Sinixt were heavily depopulated by one or two [[smallpox]] epidemics that preceded the arrival of [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] [[fur trade|fur-trader]]s of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].  The epidemic of 1781 was likely the biggest single outbreak, with accounts of that epidemic describing a mortality rate up to 80%.  [[David Thompson (explorer)]] and other early traders noticed the pock-marked faces of older Sinixt and heard oral accounts of the epidemic.  There is also evidence that the Sinixt were seriously affected by the major political upheavals that preceded the arrival of the Europeans.  The [[Ktunaxa]] (Kutenai) people who neighboured the Sinixt to the east were driven further into the mountains by the [[Blackfoot]], who had obtained control of Ktunaxa territory in the foothills and northwestern plains.  There is ethnographic evidence suggesting the Ktunaxa and the Sinixt battled each other over the territory along the lower Kootenay River between the present cities of [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]] and [[Castlegar, British Columbia]].  The Ktunaxa were considered the intruders, and the dispute was reportedly ended after the Sinixt mounted a large-scale raid into (Lower) Ktunaxa Territory at the South end of Kootenay Lake.  The Sinixt later renewed their historic peace with the Ktunaxa, and took common cause with them, the [[Kalispel]], the [[Flathead]], the [[# Coeur D'Alene Tribe|Coeur d'Alene]], the [[Spokane (tribe)|Spokane]], the [[Nez Perce]], and others against the Blackfoot.  While the Sinixt never directly fought the Blackfoot as a group, it is very likely that individual Sinixt joined their Salishan neighbours (and the Ktunaxa) in war parties and buffalo hunts to the Western Plains. Reyes says they had ongoing skirmishes with the Blackfoot, from whom, according to him, they stole horses.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 8.</ref>

===Fur trade, missionaries, and border dispute===
The Sinixt played a major but largely unheralded role in the fur trade, and also in the international dispute between [[Great Britain]] and the U.S. over the what the U.S. called the [[Oregon Country]], which was known to the British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] as the [[Columbia District]].  The Sinixt and their allies had a very close relationship with the Hudson's Bay Company, and it was to be closer to the major trading post at [[Colville]] that led the Sinixt under Lower Sinixt chief See-Whel-Ken (d. 1840)<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 24.</ref> to winter near there for the first time in 1830-31.  Indeed, Fort Colville was created to replace Spokane House, specifically to be closer to the Sinixt.  The Sinixt supported the company in its efforts to prevent American trappers and settlers from entering and taking over the territory<!--in many areas, this was by furthering the creation of a "fur desert", by deliberately depleting fur resources; was this the case in Sinixt turf, or was it physical resistance in this case?-->.  As fur traders, the Sinixt were among the most prolific of all the First Nations who traded at [[Fort Colville]].

In 1837, [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries arrived in the area. St. Paul's Mission at Kettle Falls was constructed with the help of Colville and Sinixt labor. According to Reyes, it was in the 1840s that the Sinixt experienced a major die-off, shrinking from about 3,000 to about 400 during the period of chief Kin-Ka-Nawha, nephew of See-Whel-Ken. Besides diseases and incursions on their land, the salmon runs began to diminish because to the development of commercial fisheries at [[Astoria, Oregon]] near the mouth of the Columbia. Some saw the die-off as a failure of the powers of their traditional religion; Kin-Ka-Nawha was, himself, among the eventual converts to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]].<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 25–26.</ref>

===One Nation, Two Countries===
When the United States gained formal control of the Oregon Country south of the 49th Parallel in 1846, most Sinixt remained in American territory near Kettle Falls, where Fort Colville continued to operate.  Kettle Falls (or just above it) was essentially the Southern boundary of Sinixt Territory, and was shared with the Colville People.  They were always extremely close to the Colville People, and the Sinixt's arrival at the falls during fishing season would be celebrated with a three-day dance.  Another 3 day dance would be celebrated at their departure.

In the wake of the partition, the [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson's Bay fur company]] created [[Fort Shepherd]], just upstream from the confluence of the Pend d'Oreille and Columbia Rivers, which was very near the border, in order to serve their former clients and also maintain a post on British territory <!--although the treaty stated they could have tried continuing to operate sout of the line...--> Adjacent Sinixt territory in British Columbia remained in the hands of the Sinixt.  As late as the 1860s, Sinixt leaders still equated British title in their Northern territory as signifying Sinixt sovereignty.  When Fort Shepherd was abandoned by the Hudson's Bay Company, for example, it was left in Sinixt hands.

===Gold/Silver Rushes===
Prospectors began entering Sinixt territory in British Columbia in the 1850s and 60s.  Nevertheless, the Sinixt managed to maintain effective control over their northern traditional territory through the 1850s, '60s, and '70s, despite some conflict.  While often accommodating White interests, they continued to claim ownership in British Columbia and resisted the American miners, sometimes by force.  The Sinixt blocked all Non-Native access to their Canadian territories on a number of occasions.  Virtually no non-Sinixt entered the Slocan Valley until the late 1880s.

However, their reduced numbers resulted in the Sinixt being unable to control development of the area as it was flooded with miners during a second mineral rush in the 1880s and '90s.  Several boomtowns were erected throughout the West Kootenay Region. The majority of Sinixt continued to live in Washington State, among the security of their friends and relatives on the Colville reserve.  Nevertheless, a number of Sinixt remained permanently in Canada during the first half of the 20th century.  Many others also returned to their ancestral land in B.C. to hunt and fish during the summer months well into the 20th Century.

Kin-Ka-Nawha resigned his role as chief as an old man. He was succeeded by Joseph Cotolegu, with Aorpaghan and James Bernard (c. 1870–1935) as subchiefs. They would succeed him, in turn, as leaders.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 26, 39, 41.</ref>

==Colville Confederated Tribes==
On the U.S. side, the Colville Confederated Tribes—now the [[Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation]] &mdash; were formally established in 1872. They were forced to become wards of the government on the Colville Reservation. It was at this time that the name ''Sinixt'' or ''Sin Aikst'' was dropped in favor of ''Lakes'', apparently at the behest of the U.S. government.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 28.</ref>

Initially, the Confederated Tribes were given a reservation east of the Columbia. Three months later, it was taken away (because white settlers wanted it) and they were given a comparably large tract on the west side of the river on inferior land. Initially this reservation extended all the way to the Canadian Border, but the northern half was taken away in 1892, which separated it from Sinixt traditional territory in British Columbia; in addition, as more tribes lost their land, the shrinking reservation had to absorb yet more people.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 29.</ref> Even then, they had to deal with incusions of miners, [[homesteading|homesteaders]], and settlers such as the [[Doukhobors]], who arrived from [[Russia]] in 1912.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 31, 34.</ref>

In 1900, Aropaghan, over James Bernard's objection, agreed to have the land divided into individual allotments rather than held in common; he also agreed to include "half breeds" equally in the allocation.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 38.</ref>

Bernard journeyed three times to [[Washington, D.C.]] on behalf of his people: first in 1890 as interpreter for [[Chief Smitkin]] of the Colvilles, then in 1900 with [[Chief Lot]] and [[Chief Barnaby]] to negotiate the reservation boundaries, and finally in 1921 as chair of a delegation of the Confederated Tribes.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 39.</ref>

==Grand Coulee Dam==
Until the construction of [[Grand Coulee Dam]], the Lower Sinixt continued to fish in their traditional manner at Kettle Falls. The Upper Sinixt could no longer get that far south. They continued to elect a Salmon Chief. They fished with baskets on poles that caught the salmon who were not strong enough to clear the falls, and also with [[spear]]s that had detachable tips, like a [[harpoon]]. Reyes sees this as the end of the traditional life of the Colville and Lakes: "After the concrete was poured into the steel framework to form the base of the dam, the great salmon runs ended. … It brought to a close a great tradition that had existed for centuries. From that day on… there was always a shortage of food. The bands dispersed… the great days of the Sin-Aikst were over."<ref>Reyes 2002, Chapter 4. Quotation is on p. 49.</ref> A few years later, rising waters from the dam also engulfed the largely Sinixt community of [[Inchelium, Washington]] on the banks of the Columbia, which had to be relocated, further disrupting even remnants of their traditional way of life.<ref>Reyes 2002, Chapter 5.</ref>

===Return to Canada===
A permanent Sinixt presence was reestablished in British Columbia during the late 1980s when, following direction by an elder, a number of Sinixt descendents returned to the Slocan Valley to protest road building affecting an important village site.  A bridge being built at Vallican resulted in a road being placed very near the large pithouse village.  Since then, a permanent Sinixt presence continues in the Slocan Valley, with local members overseeing the repatriation of remains and playing an increasing role in local affairs.

===Archaeology===
Recent <!--meaning when?-->archaeological work has resulted in findings hinting at a complex social society.  This is in line with historic, ethnographic, and contemporary Sinixt accounts of a socially and economically advanced society.  [[Pithouses]] in the Slocan Valley are among the earliest very large houses of this type, with some having diameters of over 20 metres (66 feet).  The Slocan Narrows site also included some of the most recent very large pithouses.  This and other evidence of a hierarchical and stratified society has led a leading scholar to state that the Sinixt's society was among the most complex of the entire region.  Unfortunately, major [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] projects along the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and [[Kootenay River|Kootenay]] Rivers have resulted in the flooding of many graveyards and the majority of Sinixt village sites.

==Status today==
The Sinixt today live primarily on the [[Colville Indian Reservation]] in Washington, where they form part of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which has governmental recognition as an American Indian Tribe. 

A few Sinixt live in their traditional West Kootenay territory, particularly the [[Slocan Valley]]. They are not recognized by the Canadian government, and were officially declared "extinct" by that country in 1956 by the [[Indian Act]]. There were several hundred Sinixt in Washington State at the time the Canadians declared the Sinixt extinct, along with other self-identifying Sinixt who had relocated with relatives to the Canadian [[Okanagan]]. Today, the Sinixt are taking steps to reclaim their rights in British Columbia, where the vast majority of their ancestral territory lies. Further complicating the question of the Canadian legal territory of the Sinixt, the [[Ktunaxa]] [[Kinbasket]] [[Treaty Council]] is currently negotiating a [[Treaty]] with the Canadian [[Federal Government]] and the British Columbia [[Provincial Government]] in the region. [http://www.ktunaxa.org/treaty/index.html]

===Sinixt as "Urban Indians"===
"Many Lakes (Sinixt) feel that to live ethically one must follow a moral code which maintains a reciprocal relationship between humans, the land, and the realm of spirits in which the ancestors dwell. (Elder) Eva Orr calls this 'keeping the Lakes' way.' The ideal of keeping the Lakes' way requires that people not take for their own gain but instead give back by following a [[cultural ethic]] of [[egalitarianism]], reciprocity and peaceful living.<ref>Pryce 1999, p. 130.</ref>

Several Sinixt in the group's northern territory host a weekly [[radio program]], Sinixt Radio, on [[Nelson]], [[B.C.]] [[Community Radio]] station, [http://sinixt.kics.bc.ca/radio.html [[CJLY-FM]].]

One particular family of Sinixt have figured quite prominently among recent-day "urban Indians". [[Bernie Whitebear]] (1937–2000), a [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] Indian rights activist and founder of several "urban Indian" organizations, was declared Washington state's "First Citizen of the Decade" in November 1997<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 191, 192.</ref>; his sister [[Luana Reyes]] (c.1933—2001) was, at the time of her death, deputy director of the U.S.'s 14,000-person [[Indian Health Services]]<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 185–186, gives her title as "assistant director," but the July 1999 [http://www.ncai.org/ncai/resource/documents/governance/CSCfinalrep.htm Final Report] of the National Congress of American Indians National Policy Work Group on Contract Support Costs (accessed online [[11 March]] [[2007]]) gives it as Deputy Director, as does [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/other/aianwksp/aianwksp.pdf Summary Report for the “Mobilizing American Indian and Alaska Native Communities Workshop on Improving Cardiovascular Health”, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute — Indian Health Board Partnership], May 7–8, 2001 (accessed online [[11 March]] [[2007]]) and other similar official documents.</ref>; and their brother [[Lawney Reyes]] (b. c.1931) is a Seattle-based sculptor, designer, curator and author.<ref>Reyes 2002, ''passim.''</ref>
