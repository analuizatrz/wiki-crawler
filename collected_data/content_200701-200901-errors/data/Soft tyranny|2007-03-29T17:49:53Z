'''Soft tyranny''' is an idea first coined by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his [[1835]] work entitled ''[[Democracy in America]]''.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'', (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9-15.</ref> In effect, soft tyranny occurs whenever the social conditions of a particular [[community]] hinder any prospect of [[hope]] among its members.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'', (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9-15.</ref> For Tocqueville, hope is the driving force behind all democratic institutions.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'', (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9-15.</ref> As such, whenever this all-encompassing hope is taken away from the people, [[liberal democracy]] fails. Examples of this [[failure]] can be seen in the [[Weimar Republic]] of [[Germany]] during the [[1930s]] or in the [[French Third Republic]] around [[1940]]. Hope for a better future effectively died in both of the aforementioned situations. As a result, [[fascist]] regimes were established to fill the void left by the departure of hope.
