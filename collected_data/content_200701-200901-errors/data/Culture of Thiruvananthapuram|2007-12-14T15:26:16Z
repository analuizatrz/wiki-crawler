Two most outstanding poets patronized by the royal family of [[Travancore]] were Unnayi Warrier and [[Kalakkaththu Kunchan Nambiar|Kunchan Nambiar]]. The reign of Maharaja [[Swathi Thirunal]] (1813–1846), the royal composer, saw the golden age of [[Carnatic music]] in Kerala. The contribution of Swathi Thirunal in the realm of music has enriched even the cultural heritage of [[India]]. Irayimman Thampi (1782–1856), a contemporary of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal, was another composer of great originality and deep learning. Vidwan Koi Thampuran was also a scholar and poet who belonged to this period.<!-- Who is this ? Is there is anybody who is popularly known only as "Vidwan Koi Thampuran". If this is Kerala Varma Valiakoi Thampuran, he should be named as such. -->

Thiruvananthapuram witnessed a cultural renaissance in twentieth century. Kerala Varma Valiakoi Thampuran (1845–1914), who spent a major part of his life in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], translated [[Kalidasa]]’s [[Abhijñānaśākuntalam]] into Malayalam which won him the title of '' Kerala Kalidasa ''. He is also regarded as the father of modern Malayalam prose.

The contributions of [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma]] (1863–1918), known as ”Kerala Panini”, marked an important stage in the development of Malayalam literature. Another notable writer is [[C. V. Raman Pillai]] (1858–1922), who was a novelist par excellence<ref name="C.V. Raman Pillai">

Contributions of Thiruvananthapuram to painting are immense. The earliest of murals that can be attributed to the Kerala tradition are found in a small cave-shrine at Thirunandikkara in south Travancore, now a part of [[Tamil Nadu]]. The themes of these murals are evidently drawn from Hindu lore, but the style closely resembles the [[Buddhist]] tradition. These are believed to belong to the 9th century. Siva, Parvathi and Ganapathi are among the figures represented. [[Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple]] at Thiruvananthapuram has several murals, which belongs to the 18th century. The paintings at Koikal Temple at Attingal bear close resemblance to those in the Padmanabha Swami Temple, which are examples of 16th century Kerala
