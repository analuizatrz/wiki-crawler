'''''The Giver''''' is a [[soft science fiction]] [[novel]] written by [[Lois Lowry]] and published on [[April 16]], [[1993]]. It is set in a future society which is at first presented as a [[utopia]] and gradually appears more and more [[dystopia|dystopic]], so could therefore be considered ''[[anti-utopia|anti-utopian]]''. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. Jonas' society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to "Sameness", a move which has also eradicated [[emotion]]al depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of "Receiver of Memory," the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed. As Jonas receives the memories from his predecessor—the Giver—he discovers how shallow his community's life has become.

Despite controversy and criticism that the book's subject material is inappropriate for young children, ''The Giver'' won the 1994 [[Newbery Medal]] and has sold more than 3.5 million copies. In the [[Education in the United States|United States]], it is a part of many [[middle school]] reading lists, but it is also on many banned book lists (''see [[#Controversy|Controversy]]''). The novel forms a loose trilogy with ''[[Gathering Blue]]'' (2000) and ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]]'' (2004), two other books set in the same future era.

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
At first glance, the novel's setting seems to be a utopia, where all possible steps are taken to eliminate pain and anguish. Two-way speakers monitor every household for rule infractions. The people are almost always compliant; families share their dreams and feelings on a daily basis to defuse emotional buildup. This society remains harmonious by matching up husbands and wives based on personality compatibility. 

Lowry describes creating the pain-free world of Jonas's Community in her Newbery speech:	 
<blockquote>
I tried to make Jonas's world seem familiar, comfortable, and safe, and I tried to seduce the reader. I seduced myself along the way. It did feel good, that world. I got rid of all the things I fear and dislike; all the violence, poverty, prejudice and injustice, and I even threw in good manners as a way of life because I liked the idea of it.<br/>One child has pointed out, in a letter, that the people in Jonas's world didn't even have to do dishes.<br/>It was very, very tempting to leave it at that.<ref>from Lowry's "Newbery Award" acceptance speech</ref>
</blockquote>

[[Image:Lowry-giver-1999-paperback.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cover of 1999 paperback edition]]
As time progresses in the novel, however, it becomes clear that the society has lost contact with the ideas of [[family]] and [[love]] (at least in the "more complete" sense at which Lowry hints). Children are born to designated "birthmothers" and then distributed, one boy and one girl per family, in order to achieve balance in the population. After family units have served the purpose of raising the children in a stable environment, they cease to exist, the parents going to a communal housing facility for childless adults, and the children becoming involved in their work and starting monogenerational families of their own. The community maintains this process using pills which suppress emotion, mainly romantic love and sexuality.

All the land near the community and around the other, similar towns clustered about the nearby river has been flattened to aid [[agriculture]] and [[transportation]]. Climate control is used so the [[weather]] remains constant. 

The community is run by a Council of Elders that assigns each 12-year-old the job he or she will perform for the rest of his or her life. People are bound by an extensive set of rules touching every aspect of life, which if violated would require a simple but somewhat ceremonious apology. In some cases, violating the rules is "winked at": older siblings invariably teach their younger brothers and sisters how to ride a [[bicycle]] before the children are officially permitted to learn the skill. If a member of the community has committed serious infractions twice before, he or she may be punished by "release", which can be seen as this future world's equivalent to [[death]] (although being sentenced for release is not defined as actually dying in the community).

The "Ceremony of Release" recurs throughout the novel, becoming more ominous as more details are revealed. Early in the story, we learn that the procedure is generally considered a shameful fate, particularly if the one released is a functioning member of society. On the other hand, Release of the elderly is an occasion of joyful celebration, and release of an infant is regarded as unavoidable to preserve balance. Later, it is learned the specific criteria for which infants, under the care of assigned Nurturers before they are assigned to families, are selected for Release. In particular, if a Birthmother produces identical twins, a Nurturer weighs them and Releases the lighter of the two.

The people of Jonas' community believe that those Released are sent "Elsewhere," probably to another community. As the novel nears its climax, the protagonist discovers that release is actually [[euthanasia]]. The scene which makes this revelation has drawn criticism from some adults who would rather not see children exposed to such descriptions.

The book is told from a [[Third person limited omniscient|third-person limited]] point of view. The [[protagonist]], Jonas, is followed as he awaits the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas lives in a standard family unit with his mother (a [[judge]]) and father (a "nurturer"). He is selected to be "Receiver of Memory", because of his unusual "capacity to see beyond", which is an ability to do something unusual, such as [[colorblindness|see color]] (which all the other people were genetically changed not to see) or hear [[music]] (Which was how the previous Receiver was found). He trains for the position of Receiver by receiving memories from the aged incumbent (known to the community as "the Receiver", and to Jonas as "the Giver") who is burdened by the emotional weight of the memories.  These memories are images from the world before Sameness, "back and back and back", things that no one else in Jonas's world remembers. 

Through the Giver,<!-- The character, not the book's title! --> Jonas receives memories of things eliminated from his world: [[violence]], [[sadness]], and loss, as well as true [[love]], [[beauty]], [[joy]], [[adventure]], and [[family]]. Eventually, these revelations prompt Jonas to seek to change the community and return emotion to the world. He and the Giver plan on doing this by having Jonas leave the community, which would cause all of the memories he was given to be released to the rest of the people, allowing them to feel the powerful emotions that Jonas and the Giver feel. Meanwhile, the family temporarily adopts a baby named Gabriel who is unable to sleep throughout the night. Jonas learns that unlike the other people in his community, Gabe can receive memories from Jonas, which are used to calm the baby to sleep throughout the night. The family decides that Gabriel is too much trouble, however, and decide to release him. Desperate, Jonas flees the community with Gabe. At first, the escape seems successful. Soon, however, food runs out and they grow weak. They find a snow covered hill with a sled on top, which Jonas remembers from the first memory he ever Received. He and Gabriel board the sled and go down the hill where they hear singing.

The ending is ambiguous, and Jonas' future and even survival are left unresolved.

==Characters in ''The Giver''==
*'''Jonas''' – the protagonist, an Eleven year-old when the novel opens, who is selected to become Receiver of Memory at his Ceremony of Twelve.
*'''The Giver''' – the incumbent Receiver of Memory, who stores human experiences from the time before Sameness. The Community's Elders rely upon his "wisdom" in the event of emergencies; because no one wants the pain that comes with keeping the necessary memories, this "honor" is restricted to one individual. He is angry with the Elders for only consulting him during emergencies instead of all of the time and seems somewhat disgusted by the actions of the community's people, though he tells Jonas that they "know nothing".
*'''Jonas's Mother''' – an intelligent, practical woman who serves her Community as a judge.
*'''Jonas's Father''' – a caring man, something of the ideal father figure, who works as a nurturer for Children in their first year of life. Later, Jonas learns that his father is, sometimes, responsible for the Release of defective children.
*'''Lily''' – Jonas's talkative, enthusiastic and outgoing younger sister. 
*'''Asher''' – Jonas's closest friend, a cheerful and easygoing boy who is assigned the position of Assistant Director of Recreation.
*'''Fiona''' – Female friend of both Jonas and Asher. Her red hair represents a failure of genetic engineering, as the Giver notes. "We never completely mastered Sameness [...] Hair like Fiona's must drive them crazy." She works as a Caretaker for the Old. Despite her kind demeanor, she is adept at Releasing the elderly without emotion. She also is the one whom Jonas dreams about in his "stirrings". She is also referred to as his 'favorite female'.
*'''Gabriel''' – an infant from the Nurturing Center whom Jonas's father takes home for extra care. Slow in development and highly emotional, Gabriel is at risk of Release. Jonas takes him on his journey to Elsewhere. Gabriel is able to Receive memories from Jonas.
*'''Rosemary''' – the Elders' previous selection to be the new Receiver of Memory, when Jonas was a Two. Her training failed, in a way which impacted the entire Community: defeated by the memories of loss and hurt which the Giver was forced to transfer, she asked for Release. Once she was "Elsewhere", the memories given her had no place to go, so they floated freely. The Giver reveals that Rosemary was his daughter, though some believe the Giver uses the term "daughter" metaphorically.
*'''Caleb''' – A child who drowned in the river near the town. Because of release, death is not known (old people are released at a certain age), so this shocks the global community. They chant his name all day in a "Ceremony of Loss" until it fades from their memories.

==Major themes==
[[Color]] represents diversity and a depth of feeling beyond that which the majority of society enjoys. In ''The Giver,'' however, objects do not "gain" color through intense emotional experiences on the part of their observers; rather, Jonas learns to see the colors which objects intrinsically possess. Apparently, the transition to Sameness involved removing color vision from the people, although the Giver implies that genetic engineers also attempted (without total success) to remove the variability in the human population; even [[eye color|light eyes]] (which may or may not indicate that the person possessing such eyes is meant to be a Receiver; Jonas appears to think such) and [[red hair]] are rarities.

A motif of nudity recurs in several places. During his volunteer hours (a time when children aged eight to twelve explore their community and prepare for an eventual career), Jonas assists in the House of the Old, where the most aged members of the Community reside. Lowry describes how Jonas bathes an old woman, Larissa; he enjoys the trusting, carefree nature of the experience, which reminds him of his father caring for an infant. Jonas muses about how his Community has strict rules against nakedness in almost all circumstances. He personally finds them a nuisance, such as the admonition to keep oneself entirely covered while changing for athletic games, and does not understand why the Community would institute such precautions. Later, the tenderness of the bathing scene gains a sexual edge, when Jonas dreams about cajoling a female friend, the red-haired Fiona, to remove her clothes and climb into a tub so that he can bathe her. Jonas recounts this dream at his family's breakfast dream-telling, and his parents recognize it as an early sign of what they call "the stirrings" ([[puberty]]). A daily pill makes the stirrings go away.

Music plays a role in ''The Giver,'' despite its presence being very subdued. Just as it is possible to read well into the novel without realizing that its characters do not [[color vision|see color]] — often until the Giver mentions that a thing called "color" once existed — it is also easy to miss the fact that the community has no music. One of the few clues is when Larissa describes a Ceremony of Release for an old man who was leaving the Community. "We chanted the anthem," she says, a phrasing which implies an absence of melody. Later, when the Giver is instructing Jonas, we learn that as a boy, the Giver had a faculty much like Jonas's ability to "see beyond". In the Giver's case, it was ''hearing'' beyond: he began to hear "something truly remarkable, which is called ''music''". (This sense is more mystical than Jonas's, in that we can understand how objects have color which people are unable to see, but we cannot identify a natural source of music — unless the Giver discovered he could hear musical patterns in everyday sound, as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] reputedly did.)

==Literary significance and criticism==
The critical reception of Lowry's work has been polarized.  On the one hand, one finds critics like [[Anita Silvey]], whose ''100 Best Books for Children'' calls ''The Giver'' one of the 1990s' greatest [[science fiction]] novels for children and young adults.<ref>[http://www.anitasilvey.com Anita Silvey], ''100 Best Books for Children'', page 147 (Houghton Mifflin, 2004).  ISBN 0-618-27889-3. </ref><ref> [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0618618775&id=O3xytWMrGxMC&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&ots=FoLRSlDJHW&dq=%22The+Giver%22+inauthor:anita+inauthor:silvey&sig=UhyZINfYEO5iZZxKK4AWn0kAqzI] Google Books view of original quote</ref>  A review in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' says, "Lowry's powerful book, simply and directly written, offers an inspiring defense of freedom. Both adventurous and skillfully plotted, this book is recommended for young readers 8 and up."<ref>"A Monitor's Guide to Children's Bestsellers", ''Christian Science Monitor'' [[24 September]] [[1998]] p. B12.</ref>

One example of a negative review from an SF writer is from Debra Doyle, who wrote 
<blockquote>
''The Giver'' fails the SF Plausibility Test for me. I don't see how a society like the one depicted could be attained/sustained in anything other than a metaphorical world. And even considered as fantasy, rather than sf, the book is too damned obvious. Things are the way they are because The Author is Making A Point; things work out the way they do because The Author's Point Requires It.<ref>"Doyle's YA SF Rant", ''[http://www.sfwa.org/writing/ya-riff.htm]</ref>
</blockquote>

''The Giver'' has become something of a [[canonical]] work among educators who believe that young adult audiences respond best to contemporary literature. These teachers postulate that "teenagers need a separate body of literature written to speak directly to the adolescent experience [...] and plots that revolve around realistic, contemporary topics". (Of course, Lowry's futuristic setting means that this ''particular'' young adult book can only address "contemporary topics" in an [[allegory|allegorical]] fashion, a point which raises questions of its own.) In this view, a "classics-only" curriculum can stunt a developing reader's appetite for words; there are naturally teachers who argue the opposite side of the argument, and press to keep older works on the reading lists.<ref>Marie C. Franklin, "CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: Debate continues over merit of young-adult fare", ''[http://www.bostonglobe.com Boston Globe]'' [[23 February]] [[1997]] p. G1.</ref>

Lowry's most celebrated and controversial novel has also found a home in "City Reads" programs, library-sponsored reading clubs on city-wide or larger scales. [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin]] and [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin]] chose to read ''The Giver,'' for example, as did [[Middletown, Connecticut]]; [[Bloomington, Illinois]]; [[Valparaiso, Indiana]]; [[Rochester, Minnesota]]; [[Central Valley, New York]]; [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]]; [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] and others.<ref>"[http://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/one-book.html 'One Book' Reading Promotion Projects]", form the [[Library of Congress]]'s Center for the Book</ref><ref>Judith Rosen, "Many Cities, Many Picks", ''Publishers Weekly'' [[10 March]] [[2003]] p. 19.</ref>

Some adult reviewers writing for adults have commented that the story is not likely to stand up to the sort of probing literary criticism used in "serious" circles. For instance, 50 children are born each year by the group of "birthmothers" who each have 3 children — therefore 17 new "birthmothers" are required each year, even though this profession is looked down upon in the book. Karen Ray, writing in the ''New York Times,'' detects "occasional logical lapses", but quickly adds that the book "is sure to keep older children reading. And thinking".<ref>Karen Ray, "Children's Books", ''New York Times'' [[31 October]] 1993.</ref>  In a similar vein, Natalie Babbitt of the ''Washington Post'' calls Lowry's work "a warning in narrative form", saying

<blockquote>
The story has been told before in a variety of forms—[[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' comes to mind—but not, to my knowledge, for children. It's well worth telling, especially by a writer of Lowry's great skill. If it is exceedingly fragile—if, in other words, some situations don't survive that well-known suspension of disbelief—well, so be it. ''The Giver'' has things to say that can't be said too often, and I hope there will be many, many young people who will be willing to listen.<ref>Natalie Babbitt, "The Hidden Cost of Contentment", ''Washington Post'' [[9 May]] 1993, p. X15.</ref>
</blockquote>

===Awards===
Lois Lowry has won several awards for her work on ''The Giver''. Most notable are the following:
* The 1994 [[Newbery Medal]]
* The 1996 [[William Allen White Award]] <ref>[http://www.emporia.edu/libsv/wawbookaward/winners/winner.htm William Allen White awards list], courtesy [[Emporia State University]]</ref>
* [[American Library Association]] listings for "Best Book for [[young adult literature|Young Adults]]," "Notable Children's Book," and "100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000."

==Allusions/references from other works==
{{spoiler}}
For a decade after ''The Giver'' was published, readers debated the meaning of its ambiguous conclusion, with little more information than Lowry's elusive statements in select interviews.

After several years of this uncertainty, Lowry revealed the next episode in the characters' lives in her novel ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]]'' (2004), set seven years after ''The Giver'' concludes. (Only Gabriel is mentioned by name, but the young man known as "Leader" is clearly Jonas.) Alert readers may also notice what was possibly a reference to Jonas in the final pages of ''[[Gathering Blue]]'' (2000). However, this link was tenuous and uncertain until ''Messenger'' made it explicit.

''The Giver'' also influenced [[Rodman Philbrick]], who cited ''The Giver'' as inspiration for his novel ''[[The Last Book in the Universe]]'' (2000).

==Adaptations==
Oregon Children's Theatre (Portland, Oregon) premiered a stage adaptation of "The Giver" by [[Eric Coble]] in March 2006 to critical acclaim [http://www.wweek.com/calendar/3218/performance/]. Subsequent productions of Coble's one-hour script have been presented by The Coterie Theatre (Missouri), First Stage (Wisconsin), People's Light and Theatre (Pennsylvania), Theatre of Youth (New York), and Stages Repertory (Texas), and others throughout the U.S..   

In the fall of 1994, actor [[Jeff Bridges]] and his ASIS Productions film company established an agreement with Lancit Media Productions to adapt ''The Giver'' to film. In the years following, members of the partnership changed and the production team grew in size, but little motion was seen toward making the film. At one point, screenwriter Ed Neumeier was signed to create the screenplay. Later, Neumeier was replaced by [[Todd Alcott]]<ref>[http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/g/giverthe.htm Article on the film adaptation]</ref> and [[Walden Media]] became the central production company.<ref>"Jeff Bridges and Lancit Media to co-produce No. 1 best seller 'THE GIVER' as feature film", ''Entertainment Editors'' [[28 September]] [[1994]].</ref><ref>Ian Mohr, "Walden gives 'Giver' to Neumeier", ''[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com Hollywood Reporter]'' [[10 July]] 2003.</ref>

An [[Internet Movie Database]] entry for ''The Giver'' appeared in late 2004, which claims a release date in 2007.  Bridges himself is, at present, the only credited cast member to be listed. ''[[The Giver (film)|The Giver]]'' is currently in pre-production and is slated for release in 2007. It is to be directed by Vadim Perelman, who also wrote the screenplay.<ref>{{imdb title | id=0435651 | title=The Giver}} (in production)</ref>

Actor [[Ron Rifkin]] read the text for the [[audio book]] edition.
