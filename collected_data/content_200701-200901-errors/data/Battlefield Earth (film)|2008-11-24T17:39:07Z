'''''Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000''''' is an [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[film]] adaptation of the novel ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'' by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] that was released on May 12, 2000. The film stars [[John Travolta]], [[Forest Whitaker]], and [[Barry Pepper]]. The film depicts an Earth that has been under the rule of the alien Psychlos for 1,000 years and tells the story of the rebellion that develops when the Psychlos attempt to use the surviving humans as [[gold mining|gold miners]].<ref name="sightsound">{{cite news|author=Staff|title=Battlefield Earth|work=[[Sight & Sound]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=May 2000}}</ref>

Travolta, a long-time [[Scientology|Scientologist]], had sought for many years to make a film of the novel by Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. He was unable to obtain funding from any major studio due to concerns about the film's script, prospects, and connections with Scientology. The project was eventually taken on by an independent [[production company]], [[Franchise Pictures]], which specialized in rescuing stars' stalled pet projects. Travolta signed on as a co-producer and contributed millions of dollars of his own money to the production, which was largely funded by a German film distribution company. Franchise Pictures was later sued by its investors and was [[bankruptcy|bankrupted]] after it emerged that it had [[fraud]]ulently overstated the film's budget by $31&nbsp;million.<ref name="fiasco">{{cite book | title=Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops| last=Parish| first=James Robert| year=2007| pages=275–291| publisher=Wiley| isbn=0470098295}}</ref>

''Battlefield Earth'' was a major [[Box office bomb|commercial failure]] and [[Flop|critical flop]] and has been widely dismissed as one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]].<ref name="duncancampbell"/><ref name="Travolta Sets Sights">{{cite web|url=http://cache-origin.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=51e04b9f-62f2-475c-a813-3ef6f414da49|title=Travolta Sets Sights on "Battlefield Earth 2"|accessdate=2007-03-26|last=Farache|first=Emily|date=[[2000-10-18]]|publisher=E! Online}}</ref> Reviewers universally panned the film, criticizing virtually every aspect of the production. Audiences were reported to have ridiculed early screenings and stayed away from the film after its opening weekend. This resulted in ''Battlefield Earth'' failing to recoup its costs. Travolta originally envisioned the film as the first of two adapted from the book, as the screenplay only covered the first half of the novel. However, the film's poor [[box office]] performance meant that the planned sequel was not made.<ref name="fiasco" />

==Plot==
In the year 3000, Earth has been ruled by the Psychlos, a brutal race of giant humanoid aliens, for 1,000 years. The remnants of humanity are either [[slavery|enslaved]] by the Psychlos and used for manual labor or survive in primitive tribes living in remote areas outside Psychlo control. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler ([[Barry Pepper]]), a member of one such tribe, leaves his home in the [[Rocky Mountains]] on a journey of exploration. He joins forces with Carlo ([[Kim Coates]]), a hunter, but both men are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp at the Psychlos' main base on Earth, a giant dome built over the ruins of [[Denver, Colorado]].

Terl ([[John Travolta]]), the Psychlo security chief on Earth, has been condemned by his superiors to remain indefinitely at his post as punishment for his greed and incompetence. Aided by his deputy, Ker ([[Forest Whitaker]]), Terl devises a plan to buy his way off the planet by making a fortune using human slaves to mine gold in [[radioactive]] areas. Psychlos are unable to visit such areas due to the explosive interaction of the gas that they breathe with radionuclide particles. Terl selects Jonnie as his "foreman" for the project and gives him a Psychlo education using a rapid-learning machine. Terl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to go out and find gold.

Inspired to revolt by the sight of a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], which he finds in the ruins of the [[Denver Public Library]], Jonnie plots a human uprising against the Psychlos. He obtains gold from [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] to satisfy Terl's demands, instead of mining gold as ordered. Jonnie and his followers find an abandoned underground US military base with working aircraft, weapons, fuel, and nuclear bombs. They use the base's flight simulators to train themselves in aerial combat.

After a week of training, the rebels launch a mass uprising against the Psychlos using [[AV-8 Harrier II|Harrier]] jump-jets and other weapons. Carlo sacrifices himself to destroy the dome over Denver, and the Psychlos inside suffocate in Earth's atmosphere, which they are unable to breathe. Jonnie captures a Psychlo [[teleportation]] device and uses it to teleport an [[atomic bomb]] to the Psychlo home world. The ensuing detonation causes the entire Psychlo atmosphere to explode, wiping out the planet. Ker and Terl survive on Earth but face different fates: Ker sides with the victorious humans, while Terl is imprisoned as a hostage. The film ends with the humans in control of Earth but facing an uncertain future.

===Initial deals===
After ''Battlefield Earth'' was published in 1982, L. Ron Hubbard suggested that a film version of the book was in the works. He gave an interview in February 1983 to the ''Rocky Mountain News'' in which he told the reporter, "I've recently written three screenplays, and some interest has been expressed in ''Battlefield Earth'', so I suppose I'll be right back in [[Hollywood]] one of these days and probably on location in the Denver area for ''Battlefield Earth'' when they film it."<ref name="lamont">{{cite book | title=[[Religion Inc.]]| last=Lamont| first=Stewart| year=1986| page=156| publisher=Harrap| location=London| isbn=0245543341}}</ref> 

Hubbard's comments suggest that he saw himself being directly involved in the film's production; author Stewart Lamont suggests that Hubbard may even have envisioned directing it, given his previous work on [[Scientology]] training films.<ref name="lamont" /> In October 1983, the film rights were sold by the [[Church of Scientology]]'s in-house literary agency, [[Author Services Inc.]], to Salem Productions of [[Los Angeles]]. Two films were envisaged, each covering half of the book and tentatively budgeted at $15 million each.<ref>{{cite news | last =[[Author Services Inc.]] | title =Press Release| publisher =[[Business Wire]]| date= [[1983-10-14]] }}</ref> William Immerman was set as the producer for the film.<ref name="blowen">{{cite news | last =Blowen | first =Michael | title =Welles Returns to Direct | work =[[Boston Globe]] | page =69 | publisher =Globe Newspaper Company | date = [[1984-11-27]] }}</ref> Veteran screenwriter [[Abraham Polonsky]] and British director [[Ken Annakin]] were hired to produce a film breakdown, with production scheduled to begin in 1985.<ref>{{cite news | last = [[Author Services Inc.]] | title =Press Release | publisher = [[Business Wire]] | date = [[1984-04-18]] }}</ref> In November 1984, [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] public relations firm Dateline Communications announced a nationwide contest to promote the film.<ref name="blowen" /> First and second place prizes were an all-expense paid trip to the film's production location and a paid walk-on part in the film, and other announced prizes included a trip to Los Angeles for the world premiere, records, cassettes, and hardcover and paperback copies of the novel.<ref name="blowen" /> A 30-foot (10&nbsp;m) high inflatable figure of the film's villain, Terl, was erected by Scientology officials on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] in 1984 in an effort to promote the production and auditions were held in Denver. However, despite the burst of publicity, the low-budget project soon collapsed.<ref name="ladn">{{cite news | last = Whipp | first = Glenn | title = The Battle For 'Earth': Travolta's Scientology Ties Raise Controversy Over New Film | work = [[Los Angeles Daily News]] | date = 2000-05-12 }}</ref>

John Travolta converted to Scientology in 1975 and subsequently became one of the Church of Scientology's most prominent supporters. Hubbard sent him an autographed copy of ''Battlefield Earth'' when the book was first published in 1982; he reportedly hoped that Travolta would turn the book into a film "in the vein of ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''".<ref name="hs">{{cite news | last = Staff| title = Science Friction | work = [[Herald Sun]] | date = 2006-04-12 }}</ref> Although Travolta was interested, at the time his influence in Hollywood was at a low ebb after a series of flops. He gained renewed influence with the success of the 1994 movie ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which garnered Travolta an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].<ref>{{cite news | last =Burger | first =Mark | title =Since Pulp Fiction, Travolta Has Been Flying Steady Course | work =[[Winston-Salem Journal]] | page =1 | date = [[1999-06-18]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Hernandez | first =Greg | title =Travolta in a Fever Once Again | work =Daily News of Los Angeles | page =A2 | date = [[2007-12-06]] }}</ref> He had not forgotten Hubbard's wishes to see the book on the big screen and took on the task of making ''Battlefield Earth'' into a movie.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pearlman | first = Cindy | title = Travolta Wins His Fight To Film 'Battlefield Earth' | work = [[The Plain Dealer (newspaper)|The Plain Dealer]] | date = 2000-05-07 }}</ref> Travolta described the book in interviews as "like ''Pulp Fiction'' for the year 3000" and "like ''[[Star Wars]]'', only better".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw5672.html |title=Uphill Battlefield for John Travolta and Roger Christian |accessdate=2006-09-04 |last=Lee |first=Patrick |date=[[2000-05-15]] |work=Sci Fi Weekly |publisher=SciFi.com}}</ref><ref name=vain>{{cite web | first = Mark | last = Morris | title = You're so vain... | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,319213,00.html | work = | publisher = [[The Observer]] | date = [[2000-05-28]] | accessdate = 2008-01-11 }}</ref> He lobbied influential figures in Hollywood to fund the project and was reported to have recruited the aid of fellow Scientologists in promoting it.<ref name="bercovici" /> According to Bill Mechanic, the former head of [[Twentieth Century Fox]], "He had Scientologists all over me.

===Franchise Entertainment===
In 1998 the project was taken over by Franchise Entertainment, a recently established company whose head [[Elie Samaha]], a former [[dry cleaning]] mogul turned nightclub owner, specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios.<ref name="variety_10may04" /> His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented that they were "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads".<ref>{{cite news | last =Bing | first =Jonathan | title =The Samaha Syndrome | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[2003-06-09]]}}</ref> As Samaha put it, "I said, 'If John wants to make this movie, what does he want to get paid?' ... Because I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.'"<ref name="nyt_14may00" /> He learned of ''Battlefield Earth'' from [[Cassian Elwes]], an agent at the theatrical agency [[William Morris Agency|William Morris]], and approached Travolta.<ref name="nyt_14may00" /> A deal was soon struck and financing was arranged; Travolta significantly reduced his normal fee of $20&nbsp;million, lowering the film's cost from the $100&nbsp;million that had previously been forecast, and costs were reduced further by using Canadian locations and facilities.<ref name="hs" /> 

The film was set up as an independent production for [[Morgan Creek Productions]] which would release the film through [[Warner Bros.]] in the U.S. under an existing distribution agreement. Travolta's company JTP Films was also involved, and Travolta invested $5&nbsp;million of his own money in the production.<ref>{{cite news | last =Staff | title =Christian to direct Travolta in 'Earth' | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1999-01-14]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Schneller | first =Johanna | title =Vanity projects are like land mines.

The Intertainment deal later became the focus of a legal action that bankrupted Franchise.<ref name="variety_10may04" /> Samaha forecast that the film would be a hit: "My projected numbers on ''Battlefield Earth'' are really conservative. I'm already covered internationally, and there's no way I'm going to lose if the movie does $35&nbsp;million domestically. And Travolta has never had an action movie do under $35&nbsp;million."<ref name="nyt_14may00" />

{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote="[Battlefield Earth] is going to make people in Hollywood take notice of Elie Samaha. I'm not going to be the laughing stock any more."|source=Elie Samaha<ref name="waxman" />}}
According to Samaha, he got around the "negative factor" of the Scientology connection by the simple expedient of "yell[ing] at everyone, 'This is a science-fiction film starring John Travolta!' again and again".<ref name="dixon" /> Samaha acknowledged that "everyone thought I was crazy or mentally retarded" for taking on the project, but pitched the film as "''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' starring John Travolta".<ref name=Dreams /> He was bullish about the film's prospects, telling ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that "it is going to make people in Hollywood take notice of Elie Samaha. I'm not going to be the laughing stock any more."<ref name="waxman">{{cite news | last =Waxman | first =Sharon | title =Silly 'Earth' loses the battle at the box office | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = [[2000-06-02]] }}</ref> Others in Hollywood were still skeptical; an unnamed producer was quoted by the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' as saying that "''Battlefield Earth'' has the stench of death. It should never have been made. It's an $80&nbsp;million vanity project for Travolta."<ref name="ladn" /> Travolta's theatrical agency [[William Morris Agency|William Morris]] was also said to be unenthusiastic, reportedly leading to Travolta threatening to leave them if they did not help him to set up the film. Fellow Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]] was said to have warned Warner Bros. that he thought the movie was a bad idea, although this was later denied by his spokesperson.<ref name="ladn" />

=== Author Services Inc. and Church of Scientology ===

In 1999, [[Author Services Inc.]] said that it was "donating its share of the profits from the film to charitable organizations that direct drug education and drug rehabilitation programs around the world".<ref>{{cite web | first = Enzo | last = Di Matteo | title = Battlefield Travolta | url = http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/18/49/News/feature2.html | work = | publisher = [[NOW Magazine]] | date = [[1999-08-05]] | accessdate = 2007-10-11 }}</ref> It was reported that the merchandising revenues would be passed on to the Scientology-linked "social betterment" groups [[Narconon]] and [[Applied Scholastics]], with movie-related sales of the book funding the marketing of Hubbard's fiction books and the L.

In February 2000, Church of Scientology spokesman [[Mike Rinder]] told [[Tribune Media Services]] that any spinoff deals based on Hubbard's novel would benefit Author Services Inc. while another church spokesman, Aron Mason, stated, "The church has no financial interest in Battlefield Earth. Author Services is not part of the Church of Scientology.

Travolta's manager Jonathan Krane denied that the Church of Scientology was playing any part in the production: "I've never even dealt with or talked to the church on this. This is an action-adventure, science-fiction story. Period.

This is not about Hubbard. I'm very interested in Scientology, but that's personal. This is different."<ref name="graham" /> In a separate interview Travolta commented on the perceived similarities between ''Battlefield Earth'' and Scientology: "Well, they are kind of synonymous ... L. Ron Hubbard is very famous for Scientology and [[Dianetics]]. On the other hand, he's equally as famous in the science fiction world. So for people to think that ... look, I don't want everybody to try Scientology. I don't really care if somebody thinks that. I'm not worried about it. You can't be. The truth of why I'm doing it is because it's a great piece of science fiction.

==Production==
Travolta and his manager, Jonathan Krane, took the lead in hiring the on-set personnel. They initially approached [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct the film. When Tarantino declined, [[Roger Christian (filmmaker)|Roger Christian]], a protégé of [[George Lucas]], was recruited as the director.<ref name="nyt_14may00" /> Christian had most recently been the [[second unit]] director on Lucas' ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last =Staff|| title =Self-Assured Travolta Chooses Carefully | work =[[Detroit Free Press]] | page =6D | date = [[1999-06-18]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Staff | title =Roger Christian | work =[[Internet Movie Database]] | url =http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002337/ | accessdate = 2008-01-20 }}</ref> [[Patrick Tatopoulos]] was signed to develop the production design and costumes, including the design of the alien Psychlos, and [[Czech-American]] composer [[Elia Cmiral]] was signed to provide the film's score.<ref name="time" /><ref name="space">{{cite news | last =Peterson | first =Robert | title ='Battlefield' Director: Pulp Sci-Fi or Modern Myth? | work =Space.com | publisher =Imaginova Corp. | date = [[2000-05-11]] | url =http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/movies/battlefield_earth_christian_000511.html | accessdate = 2008-02-01 }}</ref> Travolta and Krane also signed the cinematographer and most of the principal actors.<ref name="nyt_14may00" /> Corey Mandell, a screenwriter who had previously worked with [[Ridley Scott]] on ''[[Blade Runner]]'', signed on to write the script for the film, which had previously gone through 10 revisions.<ref name="leiby" /> Mandell stated in an interview, "I am not a Scientologist ... I came on board because John asked me to read the book and said, 'It's not a religious book. It's a science-fiction story.

The film's exceptionally bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth led to a precipitous falling-off in its grosses.

Travolta responded a week later to the awards: "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me whose job it is to not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. ... Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if ''Battlefield Earth'' was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer."<ref>{{cite news | last =Staff | title =Travolta reacts to Raspberry awards win | work=[[The Guardian]] | date = 2001-04-03 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,467861,00.html | accessdate = 2008-01-20 }}</ref> He later insisted that he still felt "really good about it.

Pepper said that he regretted not having been invited to the Razzies and blamed the movie's failure on "a weak script and poor production values".<ref>{{cite news | last =Staff | title =Barry Pepper amused by his worst supporting actor award for ''Battlefield Earth'' | work =[[The Canadian Press]] | date = [[2001-03-30]] }}</ref> J.D.

It is the kind of film that makes a movie legend and we feel we have enough staying power to last long after the critics have quieted down."<ref>{{cite news | last =Sinclair | first =Keith | title =Battlefield Earth gets record seven Golden Raspberries; Travolta voted the worst actor of the year | work =Glasgow Herald | date = [[2001-03-26]] }}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Claims of Scientology influence and subliminal messages===
[[Stacy Brooks]], then-president of the [[Lisa McPherson Trust]] stated, "There's no way that this movie would be happening without Scientology's backing ... This is one example of how Scientology insinuates itself in various aspects of the culture."<ref name="tribune" /> [[Mark Bunker]] characterized the film as a recruitment tactic for the Church of Scientology, stating, "It's designed to introduce L. Ron Hubbard to a whole new generation of kids. It's there to plant a favorable seed in children's minds."<ref name="lattin">{{cite web | first = Don | last = Lattin | title = Travolta's Religious Battlefield: Critics say movie bolsters Scientology | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/05/15/DD13098.DTL | work =[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date = [[2000-05-15]] | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}</ref> Bunker criticized the promotional methods of the film – instead of granting interviews about the film to the press, John Travolta went on a book tour and signed copies of L. Ron Hubbard's novel.<ref name="lattin" /> Bunker stated, "When [[Michael Caine]] goes around to promote ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'', he doesn't tour bookstores and sign copies of [[John Irving]]'s novel ... Through the movie tie-in with the book, kids will send in the card to get their free poster, and eventually be introduced to Dianetics."<ref name="lattin" /> Scientologist Nancy O'Meara, at the time treasurer of the Foundation for Religious Freedom and currently treasurer of the [[Cult Awareness Network]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultawarenessnetwork.org/WhoWeAre.html|title=Who We Are|publisher=www.cultawarenessnetwork.org|work=[[Cult Awareness Network]]|accessdate=2008-05-16|last=O.Meara|first=Nancy}}</ref> responded to Bunker's statement: "Gimme a break ...

Before the film was released, rumors and allegations began to circulate that ''Battlefield Earth'' contained [[subliminal messages]] promoting Scientology.<ref>{{cite news  | last =Whipp   | first =Glenn ([[Los Angeles Daily News]])  | title ='Battlefield' Mirth: Hubbard Hubbub Hush-Hushed  | work =The Stuart News  | page =D3  | date =May 12, 2000  }}</ref><ref name="haperstein">{{cite news  | last =Erstein  | first =Hap   | title =Scientology?

===Fraud by Franchise Pictures===
Following the failure of ''Battlefield Earth'' and other films independently produced by [[Franchise Pictures LLC|Franchise Pictures]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the [[FBI]] was probing "the question of whether some independent motion picture companies have vastly inflated the budget of films in an effort to scam investors".<ref>{{cite news | last =Staff | title =FBI Probes Big Indie Budgets | work =[[Internet Movie Database]] | pages =StudioBriefing | date = [[2002-06-06]] | url =http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2002-06-06#film5 | accessdate =2008-01-20 }}</ref> In December 2000 the German-based [[Intertainment AG]] filed a lawsuit alleging that Franchise Pictures had fraudulently inflated budgets in films including ''Battlefield Earth'', which Intertainment had helped to finance.<ref name="hr_22dec00">{{cite news | last =Randall | first =Laura | title =Franchise, Intertainment duel; Countersuits ask $75&nbsp;million-plus each in film licensing dispute | work =[[Hollywood Reporter]] | date = [[2000-12-22]] }}</ref> Intertainment had agreed to pay 47% of the production costs of several films in exchange for European distribution rights, but ended up paying for between 60 and 90% of the costs instead. The company alleged that Franchise had defrauded it to the tune of over $75&nbsp;million by systematically submitting "grossly fraudulent and inflated budgets".<ref>{{cite news | last =Staff | title =$75M Battlefield Over Film Flops | work =[[New York Post]] | date =[[2001-01-19]] }}</ref>

The case was heard before a jury in a Los Angeles federal courtroom in May&ndash;June 2004.  The court heard testimony from Intertainment that according to Franchise's bank records the real cost of ''Battlefield Earth'' was only $44&nbsp;million, not the $75&nbsp;million declared by Franchise.  The remaining $31&nbsp;million had been fraudulent "padding".  Intertainment's head Barry Baeres told the court that he had only funded ''Battlefield Earth'' because it was packaged as a slate that included two more commercially attractive films, the [[Wesley Snipes]] vehicle ''[[The Art of War (film)|The Art of War]]'' and the [[Bruce Willis]] comedy ''[[The Whole Nine Yards (film)|The Whole Nine Yards]]''.<ref name="variety_10may04" />  Baeres testified that "Mr. Samaha said, 'If you want the other two pictures, you have to take ''Battlefield Earth'' &mdash; it's called packaging'".  Baeres commented: "We would have been quite happy if he had killed [''Battlefield Earth'']".<ref>{{cite news | last =Hiestand | first =Jesse | title =Baeres: No secret budget deal | work =Hollywood Reporter | date = [[2004-05-10]] }}</ref>

Intertainment won the case and was awarded $121.7&nbsp;million in damages, bankrupting Franchise Pictures. Samaha himself was declared by the court to be personally liable for $77&nbsp;million in damages.<ref name="fiasco" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Shprintz |first=Janet |title=Intertainment's attempt to collect |work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=[[2004-06-21]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117906744.html |accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref> However, the jury rejected Intertainment's claims under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations]] (RICO) statute, which would have [[Treble damages|trebled the damages]] if Franchise had been convicted on that charge.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shprintz |first=Janet |title=Samaha Slammed |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=[[2004-06-17]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117906574.html |accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref>

The failure of the film was also reported to have led in 2002 to Travolta firing his manager Jonathan Krane, who had set up the deal with Franchise in the first place.<ref>{{cite news | last =Staff | title =Krane Gives John No Lift | work =Daily Mirror | date = [[2002-04-02]] }}</ref>

==Followups and sequels==
''Battlefield Earth'' is significantly shorter than its source novel, covering only the first 436&nbsp;pages of the 1,050-page book.<ref name="zoriannakit" /> A sequel covering the remainder of the book was originally planned at the outset.<ref name="zoriannakit" /><ref name="denerstein" /> When asked during promotion of the film if there would be a ''Battlefield Earth 2'', Travolta responded, "Sure. Yeah ... I am so thrilled, believe it or not, at the outcome because I didn't believe I could get it done."<ref name="travoltawarns">{{cite news  | last =Staff | title =Travolta warns of possible sequel | work =[[Houston Chronicle]] | page =A2 | date =October 20, 2000}}</ref><ref name="guardianunlimited">{{cite news | last =Staff | title =Earth under threat again as Travolta hints at sci-fi sequel | work =[[The Guardian]] | publisher =Guardian News and Media Limited | date = [[2000-10-19]] | url =http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,384911,00.html | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}</ref> Travolta asserted that the first film would become a [[cult following|cult classic]], stating that there were already fan websites dedicated to the film.<ref name="guardianunlimited" /> Corey Mandell, the scriptwriter for the first film, was commissioned to deliver the script for the sequel and Travolta, Pepper and producer Krane were all signed up to the sequel in their contracts for the first film.<ref name="zoriannakit" /> Christian and Whitaker were approached to reprise their respective roles, and the producers planned for a 2002 release date so as not to compete with George Lucas' ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last =Staff | title ='Earth' Gets Sequel Before First Release | work =The Journal Gazette | page =1D | date =[[2000-01-08]] }}</ref><ref name="zoriannakit">{{cite news | last =Kit | first =Zorianna | title ='Earth' Is Bound For 2nd Chapter | work =Hollywood Reporter | date =[[2000-01-06]] | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4838060-1.html | accessdate =2008-01-20 }}</ref> 

According to James Robert Parish's ''Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops'', the disastrous performance of ''Battlefield Earth'' and the collapse of its financial backers made it very unlikely that a live-action sequel will be made.<ref name="fiasco" /> In a 2001 interview, Travolta stated that a sequel was not planned: "Ultimately the movie did $100&nbsp;million when you count box office, DVD sales, video and pay per view ... But I don't know what kind of number it would have to do to justify filming the second part of the book. And I don't want to push any buttons in the press and stir anybody up about it now."<ref>{{cite news | last =Pearlman | first =Cindy | title =We're safe: Travolta promises no 'Battlefield' sequel | work =[[Post-Tribune]] | page =A2 | date = [[2001-06-15]]}}</ref>

Although the short was primarily a ''[[Gladiator (film)|Gladiator]]'' parody, with the characters fighting [[Russell Crowe]] in the Roman [[Colosseum]], it included "John Travolta and the Church of Scientology" arriving in a spaceship to defeat Crowe and attempting to recruit the boys into Scientology. Travolta, along with his fellow Scientologists, was depicted as a Psychlo, as he appeared in the film.<ref name="mtv" />
