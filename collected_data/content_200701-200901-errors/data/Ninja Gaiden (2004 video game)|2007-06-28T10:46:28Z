'''''Ninja Gaiden''''' is a 2004 [[action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Team Ninja]]. It is the fifth original release in the Ninja Gaiden video game series and the first for the [[Xbox]] console.

The game features the Dragon Ninja, ''[[Ryu Hayabusa]]'' as the main protagonist. Throughout the course of the game he has to defeat hordes of enemies and go through a variety of challenging environments to reacquire the stolen Dark Dragon Blade.

The game was a revival of the [[Ninja Gaiden (series)|Ninja Gaiden]] series, being the first addition for more than nine years,  and was released to much critical acclaim. 

==Plot==
The Xbox ''Ninja Gaiden'' contains no story elements from the [[NES]] trilogy apart from minor references and recurring characters that play very similar roles to those of the original trilogy. This essentially makes it a reboot of the Ninja Gaiden "universe", although the story could be placed either before or after the events of the original trilogy. However, game director [[Tomonobu Itagaki]] commented in an interview that "Since this is a brand-new game, I prefer not to be influenced by or base it on the original story".<ref name="plot">{{cite news

===Summary===
The story revolves around the Dark Dragon Blade, which was sealed away and protected by warriors of the Dragon Lineage. Their descendants formed the Hayabusa ninja clan, and Ryu Hayabusa is one of them. The blade is stolen, and Ryu must recover it.

The Dragon Lineage was an ancient race that fought and sealed the evil deities. Later known as the Hayabusa clan of ninja, they were charged with protecting two legendary weapons: the Dragon sword, a sword that has been passed down from generation to generation in the Dragon Lineage and entrusted to the young Ryu Hayabusa while his father trained in the wilderness, and the evil Dark Dragon Blade, a sword made from the bones of an evil black dragon & the dragon's evil power sealed within so none may use it. 

[[Image:Kyoiori RyuVsDoku0000.png|thumb|right|240px|Ryu fights with Doku.]]

The Dark Dragon Blade was guarded in the Hayabusa village. The village was abruptly attacked by forces of the [[Vigoor empire]], a force led by a Greater Fiend named Doku; Ryu was away visiting the master of the Shadow clan, the [[nunchaku]] master Murai, also his Uncle, in his fortress. Doku slaughters all who stand in his way, defeating Ryu as well, and departs with the Dark Dragon Blade. During Ryu's convalescence, Murai's espionage network learns that Doku is responsible for the theft, but he had stolen it at the behest of the Vigoor emperor; they aid Ryu in infiltrating the secretive Vigoor empire to retrieve the cursed blade.

The only available transportation is an airship; it is swarming with Vigoor [[special forces]], who know of Ryu's presence. The ensuing battle destroys the airship, but Ryu escapes, lands near the capital Tairon. Atop one of the city's nightclubs, he meets [[Rachel (Ninja Gaiden)|Rachel]], a beautiful Fiend Hunter. She warns Ryu about the dangers of fighting Doku, and after being alarmed by noises in the distance, uses her [[Grappling hook]] to swing back into the city, out of Ryu's sight. Ryu then encounters a mysterious man with round shades and a Trilby type hat, who introduces himself as Gamov. He appears to know a lot about Rachel. Before Ryu can react to the words of this ominous figure, he leans over the ledge of the building, and mysteriously disappears. Investigating with the help of Murai's spy, Ayane, Ryu learns that he can enter the palace through an underground path accessible via an old monastery. There Ryu meets the fiend hunter Rachel again. The two begin to talk and Rachel questions Ryu about his abilities. When Rachel doubts Ryu's fighting skills since they only came from training, a huge fiend with two great tentacles emerges, snatches up Rachel and appears to swallow her!

After defeating the large tentacled fiend known as Hydracubus and saving Rachel's life, Ryu leaves Rachel with Ayane and enters the monastery. Fighting his way down into an underground graveyard, Ryu finds another path that could lead to the palace of Zarkhan. However, as the result of a battle with another great fiend the underground area floods with water, forcing Ryu back to the monastery. There he meets Alma. Alma and Rachel are sisters, but they carry a bloodcurse which renders them susceptible to twisting by evil fiends; this twisting is how a Greater Fiend is created (as opposed to Lesser Fiends which are brute unthinking monsters, Greater Fiends are considerably more powerful and retain their intelligence). Alma was captured by Doku and was influenced to become a Greater Fiend. The reason Rachel is a fiend hunter is to liberate her sister through death and to encompass revenge on Doku.

Alma is defeated, but not dead. Rachel watching from the rooftops, swings in with the intention of finishing off her sister and releasing her from her agony. But she can't bring herself to do it. Now appears Doku and after a brief fight, Rachel herself is captured and carried away. The aftermath of the explosive battle with Alma badly damages the monastery, which causes the Vigoor army to deploy forces in the capital. Ryu traverses the city filled with soldiers and army vehicles to the military supply base on the outskirts. Once there he destroys the [[radio]] communications tower, escaping on a stolen train found on a turntable, which Ryu crashes into another train to cover his tracks and mislead the army.

At the crash site Ryu finds a new way to get into Zarkhan; through the underground [[aqueduct]]. It leads him to the Moat of Zarkhan, where he then slays the guardian fiend Paz Zuu. Swimming through the moat, he finds his way back into the Hidden Underground and subsequently the Monastery. There he takes a now-operational elevator to the Zarkhan Stadium, where he battles Doku once more. This time comes out victorious and once again rescuing Rachel.

The other exit of the Zarkhan Stadium leads to the Palace of Zarkhan, but the doors are locked. Ryu heads into the Caverns, the only other unexplored area, and picks up the third of three fragments of a stone tablet that belong in a pedestal next a statue featuring Twin Serpents. Making his way through the Caverns, he slays the Fiend Yotunfrau and the mighty dragon Smaugan, finding the exit back in Dworku through the Aquaduct. On his way back to the Twin Serpents Plaza, he finds that the Dark Dragon's curse has transformed the Vigoor special forces patrolling the city into Fiends.

Inserting the stone tablet activates a series of teleporters strategically placed throughout Tairon and the one at the Twin Serpents Plaza brings him back to the Hayabusa Village, where he acts on a hint given by the blacksmith Muramasa and picks up Kureha's necklace (Kureha a member of the Hayabusa clan killed by Doku in the village). The gem is actually a jewel formed from the eye of a dragon that unlocks the true power of the Dragon Sword once the two are united.

Now, with the transformed, True Dragon Sword in hand, Ryu takes the teleporters to an open field with a pyramid, where the spirit of Doku has Rachel shackled up and prepares to sacrifice her to further empower Alma. To save her, Ryu must defeat Alma, who Doku has transformed into a scorpion-like being even more powerful than before. Ryu defeats Alma once more and races to save Rachel, but Alma gets there before him and having an abrupt return to her senses, takes Doku's fatal blow in place of her twin, turning back to her true human form to awaken in the arms of her sister.

Ryu leaves the sisters and continues his journey going through the pyramid and into a labyrinth where he catches glimpses of Spirit Doku. After fighting his way through the labyrinth, he confronts Spirit Doku and permanently puts an end to him. However, the Lord of Greater Fiends curses Ryu with his dying breath, turning Ryu himself into a Fiend.

With the curse doing its work, Ryu battles his way through the core of the palace. He enters a strange realm lorded over by Marbus, last of the three Greater Fiends. Marbus sends a variety of Fiends at Ryu and even resurrects two Ancient Greater Fiends, but they are all no match for Ryu now wielding the True Dragon sword. Marbus finally takes on Ryu personally, but loses nevertheless.

Ryu proceeds to ascend a long stairway that abruptly breaks, depositing him in a vast field of flowers with a gigantic statue in the distance. However, the radiant flowers are laid waste disappearing to reveal a hellish wasteland, the statue showing itself to be a golem-creature which is the Vigoor Emperor as empowered by the Dark Dragon blade. Ryu uses his own ninpo magic to fight it from the air, slaying it. The Vigoor Emperor rises from the lava once more as a creature made of hundreds of skulls, but Ryu kills it again and for good, finally freeing himself of the Fiend curse.

With the cavern collapsing, Ryu seizes the Dark Dragon Blade at last, and it's now Rachel's turn to rescue Ryu. The two return to solid land, only to be confronted by Murai, who reveals that he is the shadowy agent who has been tracking Ryu throughout the game and was responsible for betraying his mission to the Vigoor empire as well as instigating Ryu's massacre so as to strengthen it. He steals the Dark Dragon Blade from where it has fallen as Ryu made his escape and announces his intention to rule with its immense power. Nevertheless, Ryu manages to defeat Murai a second time, and reclaims the cursed blade while Murai plummets to his death in the cavern. Ryu wordlessly destroys the Dark Dragon Blade with the True Dragon Sword, leaves Rachel with only the comment "It's over," and in a final act of remembrance, returns to Kureha's grave, entrusting to her once again the dragon's eye.

==Crossover==
While it has been stated that the Xbox ''Ninja Gaiden'' universe is not the same as the one in the original ''Ninja Gaiden''<ref name="plot">{{cite news
|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/interviews/august03/itagaki/
|publisher=GameSpy
|title=Tomonobu Itagaki on Ninja Gaiden

, certain references make homage to the preceding games. However, the Xbox Ninja Gaiden takes place in the same continuity with another [[Team Ninja]] developed game series, ''Dead or Alive'', and there are several notes to back this up.

===Original Ninja Gaiden===
*Ryu's father [[Ken Hayabusa|Joe Hayabusa]] is mentioned but not seen. He plays a larger role in the first of the NES-games.

*A number of Ryu's special abilities and Ninpo-magic seen in the Xbox Ninja Gaiden are also in use in the NES-series, mostly as power ups.

*Some of the Fiends and other minor foes appear to be recreations of those seen in the NES-series. The mysterious Gamov wears an attire similar to that of the equally shadowy CIA-agents in the first Ninja Gaiden.

*The theme of the elemental swords of light and darkness is reused from ''[[Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos]]'', in which the evil mastermind [[Ashtar (Ninja Gaiden)|Ashtar]] wields the titular dark sword. Likewise, the chaotic nature and architecture of the final level appear to be heavily inspired by similar scenarios in the NES series.

*The Guillotine Throw-technique is reminiscent from the Ninja Gaiden arcade game, as is the manner of departure Ryu uses in the second final cutscene, seen originally in use at the end of every stage in the arcade game.

*The [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ryu Doppleganger|Ryu Doppleganger]] of NG Black is another element from the original and it's from NG III. The doppleganger, who is a BIO-NOID, plays a major role in NG III as he impersonated Ryu and attacked Irene. However, in NG Black, the doppleganger doesn't actually appear in the plotline but just as a boss fight, with no explanation being given for his existence. In lieu, he's a Fiend and one of Ryu's opponents. Ryu faces him several times, namely in the Hard, Very Hard and Master Ninja difficulties where he uses several of Ryu's weapons against the original.

*In Ninja Gaiden Sigma, the motorcycle bikers, who are the Vigoor Special Forces riding on motorcycles, are reminiscent of the bikers from the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden.

==Weapons==
Several weapons can be obtained in ''Ninja Gaiden''. Some are received during key [[cutscenes]], some are simply found along the way or bought from a shopkeeper, and a select few are found only after progress in a special task. Weapons come in three general classes: melee, projectile and magic. Each has varying strengths and weaknesses. Melee and magic are usually used to directly attack, with projectile for stunning and distracting.

===Melee Weapons===
Melee weapons are the main weapon class in ''Ninja Gaiden''; most of them can be upgraded throughout the game. The melee weapons can be further subdivided by size and form.

====Swords====
Swords are balanced weapons usable in most situations.
* '''Dragon Sword''' - Ryu begins the game with the Dragon Sword. It is the basic weapon that can be used in almost all situations to good effect. This sword represents the "good" to the Dark Dragon Blade's "evil". This weapon can be upgraded 2 times and then upgraded to the "True Dragon Sword".
** '''True Dragon Sword''' - After a certain point in the game, the Dragon Sword is upgraded to the True Dragon Sword, which is more powerful and has a slightly expanded move list.
* '''Plasma Saber''' - The [[lightsaber]] of ''Ninja Gaiden''. The Plasma Saber is identical in moves and power to the Dragon Sword; it is actually just a different "look" for the Dragon Sword which is obtained after completion of the game. At the point where the Dragon Sword gets upgraded into the True Dragon Sword, it becomes the ''Plasma Saber Mk. II''. The Plasma Saber Mk. II exists in ''Black'', but not the normal Plasma Saber. In the original game it is rewarded after successive play-throughs; in ''Black'', it is rewarded after a certain amount of Scarabs are given to Muramasa, or as starting equipment in some Mission Mode missions. The upgrades are the same as for the Dragon Sword.
* '''Kitetsu''' - A long sword, distinguishable from the Dragon sword by its ability to absorb its victims' health and transfer it to the user, and also by its ability to split into two swords for some attacks. Originally, Ryu too would gradually lose his health when wielding Kitetsu, and would use the Armlet of Tranquility (which gradually restores health) to counter this effect. In ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', the Kitetsu still drains health only when attacking, but upgrading it to the highest level removes this effect, as the Armlet of Tranquility was removed in the story mode of ''Ninja Gaiden Black''. This weapon can be upgraded twice.

====Chain weapons====
Short range weapons trade off power and range for speed to allow the creation of large [[Combo (video games)|combo attack]]s.
* '''[[Nunchaku]]''' - A simple wooden nunchaku. Acquired early in the game, but serves little purpose other than producing high combos for better scores once the Vigoorian Flail is acquired. It cannot be upgraded.
* '''Vigoorian Flail''' - Bears a likeness to a [[kusarigama]], but replaces the traditional iron weight with a second sickle. Essentially, it works the same as the Nunchaku, but features several additional attacks, including its own variation of the Dragon Sword's Flying Swallow attack, and deals more damage due to its bladed tips. It can be upgraded once.

====War Hammer====
Gigantic hammer/axe; it is  slow but does a large amount of damage.
* '''[[War Hammer]]''' - Rachel's weapon of choice. It can be found in the monastery after defeating Alma. It can break crumbling walls, and is a suitable substitute for the Dabilahro, which is acquired later. It can be upgraded once.

====Greatswords====
Huge swords, slower but capable of attacking multiple enemies simultaneously and dealing large amounts of damage.
* '''Dabilahro''' - A greatsword. Resembles a [[Final Fantasy weapons#Swords|Buster sword]] initially, but becomes serrated when leveled up. This weapon acts as a more versatile War Hammer: it is also capable of destroying crumbling walls. This weapon can be upgraded twice.
* '''Dark Dragon Blade''' - A powerful sword that contains an essence of pure evil. Carved from the bones of a black dragon. It is sealed and under guard by the Hayabusa clan, and is a key plot element. In ''Black'', the Dark Dragon Blade does the most damage per hit, second only to the Unlabored Flawlessness in its critical state. It cannot be upgraded. It can be found in Ch. 13 on successive play in Muramasa's shop in the original, or as a reward for trading in Scarabs in Black.
* '''Wooden Sword''' - A [[Bokken|wooden training sword]]. Its move list resembles that of the Dragon Sword, but it can only strike and cannot decapitate, in addition to lacking several other moves of the Dragon Sword. This weapon can be upgraded 7 times.
** ''Unlabored Flawlessness'' - When fully upgraded, the Wooden Sword's visual appearance changes to resemble an [[eku]]. The Unlabored Flawlessness has a unique ability to it; when the player is at low health <!--10% or less, right? -->, the characters imprinted on the back of the weapon begin to glow, signifying an increase in the weapon's power. When the character is low in health, the Unlabored Flawlessness does the most damage out of any weapon in the game.

====Staff====
* '''Lunar''' - A [[Bo (weapon)|Bo staff]]/[[spear]]. Capable of fast combo attacks to multiple enemies. This weapon performs mostly sweeping attacks that knock the enemy back or into the air. This weapon is only available in the Hurricane expansion packs or in ''Black''. This weapon can be upgraded twice.

====Special====
* '''Spear Gun''' - Underwater weapon. Blocking is not possible while wielding this weapon. It can be used above water as well.

===Projectile Weapons===
* '''[[Shuriken]]''' - The weakest of Ryu's projectile weapons, Ryu has an infinite supply. When thrown during a jump it will extend the height of the jump, and if the Y button is pressed afterwards with certain weapons the character can reach places normally out of his jumping range.
* '''Incendiary Shuriken''' - Despite the label, these are technically [[kunai]] which have a small [[explosive]] on one end. When a vulnerable enemy is struck, it activates a 3 second [[fuse]]. The kunai then explodes, damaging all enemies in the blast radius, throwing small enemies back, and dealing them damage.
* '''Windmill Shuriken''' - A giant shuriken with four folding blades, it will return to its owner when thrown. It can decapitate some enemies. 
* '''[[Smoke bomb]]''' - Temporarily blinds all enemies in the area, making them attack the area that Ryu was last in. Unlike other projectiles the Smoke Bomb cannot be thrown, and can only be laid on the ground. This renders it incapable of being used mid-jump. (''Ninja Gaiden Black'' Only)
* '''[[Bow (weapon)|Bow]]''' - A typical bow, the arrow shot travels in an arc and must be aimed accordingly.
* '''Strongbow''' - A [[composite bow]] made in Vigoor in medieval times. This bow fires arrows in straight lines directly in the center of the screen while aiming in first person.
** ''Explosive Arrows'' - Arrows with an explosive tip.
** ''APFSDS Cores'' - [[Tungsten]]-coated arrows that are [[armor-piercing]].

===Ninpo Techniques===
* '''The Art of Fire Wheels''' - Three fireballs revolve around Ryu and repel any medium-sized enemies that try to attack him.
* '''The Art of the Inferno''' - Ryu creates a giant fireball that he shoots at enemies.
* '''The Art of Ice Storm''' - A tornado of ice is created around Ryu.
* '''The Art of Inazuma''' - Ryu emits lightning bolts in many directions.

==Ninja Gaiden Black==
[[Image:Ngblack.jpg|thumb|right|''Ninja Gaiden Black'' North American box cover]]
A second edition of the game, titled '''''Ninja Gaiden Black''''', was released approximately eighteen months later, in [[September]] [[2005]]. It is essentially a [[special edition]] of the original Xbox release of ''Ninja Gaiden''. It features two new difficulty settings (Master Ninja & Ninja Dog), much of the content from both Hurricane Packs with the exception of the Intercept parry, tweaked enemy placement in the extra difficulties, four new costumes, the original arcade version of ''[[Ninja Gaiden (arcade game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' (as opposed to the original, featuring the 3 NES games ported from the SNES [[Ninja Gaiden Trilogy]]), a new mission mode with 50 short missions (including 5 from the previous Hurricane Packs) involving scenarios not found in the core game itself, one longer and more challenging mission called "Eternal Legend" (unlocked after beating 40 of the missions), and several new in-game cutscenes. Some of the additions to the game are not readily apparent. Many are only available after being unlocked by progressing through the game.

According to interviews with [[Tomonobu Itagaki]], the Ninja Dog difficulty was added only grudgingly. Itagaki felt that the standard difficulty implemented in the game was reasonable for any casual player if they persevered through the difficult parts. However, due to a strong outcry in disagreement to the difficulty level, he instituted the Ninja Dog mode as a double-edged compromise: the mode can only be accessed through dying three successive times (similar to the Special Edition of [[Devil May Cry 3]]) within the first stage, at which point the player is asked, "Do you wish to abandon the way of the ninja?" If the player selects yes, they are given accessories that enhance their abilities (but are rather demeaning to wear, such as pink armbands), more notes for the player's aid (which adopt an excessively hand-holding nature), surplus powerups, and lower prices on the more essential supplies throughout the game's merchant points. Statistic-enhancing ribbons in a variety of colours can be attached to Ryu's arm for the remainder of the game.

Ninja Gaiden Black is, however, more difficult than the original release on the higher difficulties. Several bosses including Phantom Doku and the Dark Disciple attack faster and more furiously, like their Hurricane Pack counterparts, plus a variety of dangerous new foes have been added to make life even harder. Furthermore, players who have previously played the normal edition of Ninja Gaiden will find that the Flying Swallow move, previously a powerful and useful technique, has been noticeably toned down and is a mere shadow of its old self, with some new enemies having moves specifically to punish usage of it against them. On Hard difficulty and above, many bosses are immune to the Flying Swallow, forcing players to adapt to a new and unfamiliar fighting style.

==Reception==
Ninja Gaiden received near universal critical acclaim at the time of its release. [[GameSpot]] gave it 9.4/10 saying, "This is one of the best most challenging action adventure games ever made."{{Fact|date=June 2007}} [[IGN]] also gave it 9.4/10 and said that, "Ninja Gaiden sets a new standard for third-person action games in terms of length, depth, speed, and gore."{{Fact|date=June 2007}} [[Gamepro]] commented on the game with lines such as, "The game simply knocks you on your ass and keeps kicking it throughout." and gave it a 5 out of 5.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} [[Metacritic]] rated the original 91/100 and 94/100 for Ninja Gaiden Black.[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/ninjagaiden?q=ninja%20gaiden][http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/ninjagaidenblack?q=ninja%20gaiden].

Many gamers criticize Ninja Gaiden for its poor camera placement.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Many rooms feature cameras that are placed for cinematic effect, and though they provide an exciting portrait of the action, they are often very awkward to play the game with. During some fights, the main character, Ryu, can be off-screen for several seconds at a time, often requiring the player to adjust the camera manually mid-fight. ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' and the Hurricane Packs granted users slightly increased control over the camera, but many rooms remain difficult to fight in, and in some rooms control of the camera is disabled. Many players and game critics found the game to possess a high difficulty level and learning curve, which extended to much of the downloaded content and ''Ninja Gaiden Black''<ref>See ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' for a concise summary of fan reaction: [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/08 "A Brief Index of Difficulty"]; see also Tycho's newpost [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/03/08 comment]: "Shit ''damn'' Ninja Gaiden is hard, it's so hard that your ''friends'' will die. It's also completely great - once you've gone a few levels, just start a new game real quick and take a look at the guys you thought were bad-asses before. Those guys are ''feather pillows'' compared to the beasts and murderers you rub up against later." Tycho later [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/12/27 commented]: "When you first start playing Ninja Gaiden you might be overwhelmed with its difficulty - that was certainly true in my case. In fact, it was difficult to the degree that it was utterly demoralizing and it ended up on the shelf underneath something else so I wouldn't constantly be reminded of my deficiencies."</ref> There are however multiple difficulty settings and with the release of Ninja Gaiden Black two more were added - Ninja Dog being the easiest, and Master Ninja being the hardest.

==Development==
The "Next-Generation Ninja Gaiden Project" began in [[1999]]; it was originally intended to be a game for the [[Sega NAOMI]] [[arcade system board]]. The game's development cycle was plagued by several delays and changes of platform: first to the [[Sega Dreamcast]], then as a launch title for the [[Playstation 2]].[http://www.gamespot.com/news/2450994.html?q=ninja%20gaiden%202] Finally, in 2001 Tecmo announced that [[Ninja Gaiden (series)|Ninja Gaiden]] would be exclusive to the [[Xbox]], and the game was released early in [[2004]].

Two "Hurricane Packs" were released as downloadable content via the [[Xbox Live]] service. The first made the game even harder and featured various changes to the location of items and enemies, with unlockable costumes available. The second was part of a Master Ninja Tournament, where players competed in a special set of levels to gain the highest "Karma" scores. As an honorary mention, the user names of the highest scoring participants of this tournament were put on display in the ending credits of ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', a further upgraded version released in [[2005]].

In September 2006, the Japanese magazine [[Famitsu]] revealed ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] to be an upgraded remake of the original Xbox game with a lot more features than ''Black'' had. It will also use fewer pre-rendered cutscenes.
