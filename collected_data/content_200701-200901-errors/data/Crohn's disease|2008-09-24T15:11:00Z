'''Crohn's disease''' is a [[disease]] of the [[digestive system]] which may affect any part of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] from [[mouth]] to [[anus]]. As a result, the [[symptom]]s of Crohn's disease can vary significantly among afflicted individuals. The main gastrointestinal symptoms are [[abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]] (which may be visibly bloody), [[vomiting]], or [[weight loss]]<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/crohns-disease/DS00104/DSECTION=symptoms Mayo Clinic: Crohn's Disease]</ref><ref>[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/crohns/ National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse]</ref>. Crohn's disease can also cause complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract such as [[skin rashes]], [[arthritis]], and [[uveitis|inflammation of the eye]].<ref name=Hanauer>{{cite journal | last = Hanauer | first = Stephen B. | year = 1996 | title = Inflammatory bowel disease | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 334 | issue = 13 | pages = 841–8 | pmid = 8596552 | doi =  10.1056/NEJM199603283341307 | accessdate = 2006-11-10}}</ref>

The precise cause of Crohn's disease is not known. The disease occurs when the [[immune system]] attacks the gastrointestinal tract and for this reason, Crohn's disease is considered an [[autoimmune disease]]. This autoimmune activity produces inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, and therefore Crohn's disease is classified as an [[inflammatory bowel disease]].

Like many other autoimmune diseases, Crohn's disease is believed to be genetically linked. The highest risk occurs in individuals with siblings who have the disease. Males and females are equally affected. Smokers are three times more likely to develop Crohn's disease.<ref>[http://ibdcrohns.about.com/cs/ibdfaqs/a/smokingguts.htm Nicotine and IBD - Smoking and IBD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Crohn disease affects between 400,000 and 600,000 people in North America.<ref name=Loftus>{{cite journal | last = Loftus | first = E.

==Classification==
[[Image:Distribution of CD.svg|right|thumb|250px|Distribution of gastrointestinal Crohn's disease. Based on data from [[American Gastroenterological Association]].]]
Crohn's disease is generally classified as an [[autoimmune disease]]. It invariably affects the gastrointestinal tract, most gastroenterologists categorize the presenting disease by the affected areas. ''[[Ileocolic]] Crohn's disease'', which affects both the [[ileum]] (the last part of the [[small intestine]] that connects to the [[large intestine]]) and the large intestine, accounts for fifty percent of cases. ''[[Crohn's ileitis]]'', affecting the ileum only, accounts for thirty percent of cases, and ''[[Crohn's colitis]]'', affecting the large intestine, accounts for the remaining twenty percent of cases, and may be particularly difficult to distinguish from [[ulcerative colitis]]. The disease can attack any part of the digestive tract, from [[mouth]] to [[anus]]. However, individuals affected by the disease rarely fall outside these three classifications, being affected in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the [[stomach]] and [[esophagus]].<ref name=Hanauer/>
Crohn's disease may also be categorized by the behaviour of disease as it progresses. This was formalized in the Vienna classification of Crohn's disease.<ref name=Vienna>{{cite journal | author = Gasche C, Scholmerich J, Brynskov J, D'Haens G, Hanauer S, Irvine E, Jewell D, Rachmilewitz D, Sachar D, Sandborn W, Sutherland L | title = A simple classification of Crohn's disease: report of the Working Party for the World Congresses of Gastroenterology, Vienna 1998 | journal = Inflamm Bowel Dis | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–15 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10701144}}</ref> There are three categories of disease presentation in Crohn's disease: stricturing, penetrating, and [[inflammatory]]. ''Stricturing disease'' causes narrowing of the bowel which may lead to [[bowel obstruction]] or changes in the caliber of the [[feces]]. ''Penetrating disease'' creates abnormal passageways ([[fistula]]e) between the bowel and other structures such as the skin. ''[[Inflammatory disease]]'' (or non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease) causes inflammation without causing strictures or fistulae.<ref name=Vienna/><ref name=phenotypes>{{cite journal | author = Dubinsky MC, Fleshner PP. | title = Treatment of Crohn's Disease of Inflammatory, Stenotic, and Fistulizing Phenotypes | journal = Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–200 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12744819 | doi = 10.1007/s11938-003-0001-1}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
[[Image:CD serpiginous ulcer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Endoscopy image of [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] showing [[serpiginous]] ulcer, a classic finding in Crohn's disease]]
Many people with Crohn's disease have symptoms for years prior to the diagnosis.<ref name=Pimentel>{{cite journal | last = Pimentel | first = Mark | coauthors = Michael Chang, Evelyn J. Chow, Siamak Tabibzadeh, Viorelia Kirit-Kiriak, Stephan R. Targan, Henry C.

People with Crohn's disease will go through periods of flare-ups and [[remission]].

===Gastrointestinal symptoms===

[[Abdominal pain]] may be the initial symptom of Crohn's disease. The pain is commonly [[cramp|cramp-like]] and may be relieved by [[defecate|defecation]]. It is often accompanied by [[diarrhea]], which may or may not be bloody, though diarrhea is not uncommon especially in those who have had surgery. People who have had surgery or multiple surgeries often end up with [[short bowel syndrome]] of the gastrointestinal tract. The nature of the diarrhea in Crohn's disease depends on the part of the small intestine or colon that is involved. Ileitis typically results in large-volume watery feces. Colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of higher frequency. Fecal consistency may range from solid to watery. In severe cases, an individual may have more than 20 [[bowel movements]] per day and may need to awaken at night to defecate.<ref name=Hanauer/><ref name=emed/><ref name=Podolsky/><ref>{{cite journal | last = Mueller | first = M.

In the setting of severe Crohn's colitis, bleeding may be copious.<ref name=emed/> [[Flatulence]] and bloating may also add to the intestinal discomfort.<ref name=emed/>

Symptoms caused by intestinal [[stenosis]] are also common in Crohn's disease. Abdominal pain is often most severe in areas of the bowel with stenoses. In the setting of severe stenosis, [[vomiting]] and [[nausea]] may indicate the beginnings of small [[bowel obstruction]].<ref name=emed>{{cite web|first= Latha|last= Gopal|coauthors=Senthil Nachimuthu|publisher=eMedicine|title=Crohn Disease|url=http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic477.htm|accessdate=2006-07-02|date=2006-05-23}}</ref> Crohn's disease may also be associated with [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], a type of inflammation of the bile ducts.

Perianal discomfort may also be prominent in Crohn's disease. Itchiness or pain around the [[anus]] may be suggestive of inflammation, [[fistula|fistulization]] or [[abscess]] around the anal area<ref name=Hanauer/> or [[anal fissure]]. Perianal skin [[acrochordon|tags]] are also common in Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Taylor B, Williams G, Hughes L, Rhodes J | title = The histology of anal skin tags in Crohn's disease: an aid to confirmation of the diagnosis | journal = Int J Colorectal Dis | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–9 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2769004 | doi = 10.1007/BF01649703}}</ref> [[Fecal incontinence]] may accompany peri-anal Crohn's disease. At the opposite end of the gastrointestinal tract, the mouth may be affected by non-healing sores ([[aphthous ulcer]]s). Rarely, the [[esophagus]], and [[stomach]] may be involved in Crohn's disease. These can cause symptoms including difficulty swallowing ([[odynophagia]]), upper abdominal pain, and vomiting.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fix | first = Oren K. | coauthors = Jorge A. Soto, Charles W. Andrews and Francis A.

===Systemic symptoms===
Crohn's disease, like many other chronic, inflammatory diseases, can cause a variety of [[B symptoms|systemic symptoms]].<ref name=Hanauer/> Among children, [[growth failure]] is common. Many children are first diagnosed with Crohn's disease based on [[failure to thrive|inability to maintain growth]].<ref name=Beattie/> As Crohn's disease may manifest at the time of the growth spurt in [[puberty]], up to 30% of children with Crohn's disease may have retardation of growth.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Büller | first = H.A. | year = 1997 | title = Problems in diagnosis of IBD in children | journal = The Netherlands Journal of Medicine | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = S8–S11 | doi =10.1016/S0300-2977(96)00064-2 | pmid = 9050326 }}</ref> Fever may also be present, though fevers greater than 38.5&nbsp;[[Celsius|˚C]] (101.3&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|˚F]]) are uncommon unless there is a complication such as an [[abscess]]<ref name=Hanauer/> Among older individuals, Crohn's disease may manifest as weight loss. This is usually related to decreased food intake, since individuals with intestinal symptoms from Crohn's disease often feel better when they do not eat and might lose their appetite.<ref name=Beattie>{{cite journal | last = Beattie | first = R.M. | coauthors = N. M. Croft, J. M. Fell, N. A. Afzal and R. B.

===Extraintestinal symptoms===
[[Image:Crohnie sores 4.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Erythema nodosum]]
In addition to systemic and gastrointestinal involvement, Crohn's disease can affect many other organ systems.<ref name=Danese>{{cite journal | last = Danese | first = Silvio | coauthors = Stefano Semeraro, Alfredo Papa, Italia Roberto, Franco Scaldaferri, Giuseppe Fedeli, Giovanni Gasbarrini, Antonio Gasbarrini | year = 2005 | title = Extraintestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 11 | issue = 46 | pages = 7227–36 | pmid = 16437620 | url = http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/11/7227.asp | accessdate = 2006-07-02 }}</ref> Inflammation of the interior portion of the eye, known as [[uveitis]], can cause eye pain, especially when exposed to light ([[photophobia]]). Inflammation may also involve the white part of the eye ([[sclera]]), a condition called [[Scleritis|episcleritis]]. Both episcleritis and uveitis can lead to loss of vision if untreated.

Crohn's disease is associated with a type of [[Rheumatology|rheumatologic disease]] known as [[spondyloarthropathy|seronegative spondyloarthropathy]]. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more [[joint]]s ([[arthritis]]) or muscle insertions ([[enthesitis]]). The arthritis can affect larger joints such as the knee or shoulder or may exclusively involve the small joints of the hand and feet. The arthritis may also involve the spine, leading to [[ankylosing spondylitis]] if the entire spine is involved or simply [[sacroiliitis]] if only the lower spine is involved. The symptoms of arthritis include painful, warm, swollen, stiff [[Arthralgia|joints]] and loss of joint mobility or function.

Crohn's disease may also involve the skin, blood, and [[endocrine system]]. One type of skin manifestation, [[erythema nodosum]], presents as red nodules usually appearing on the shins. Erythema nodosum is due to inflammation of the underlying subcutaneous tissue and is characterized by septal [[panniculitis]]. Another skin lesion, [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], is typically a painful ulcerating nodule. Crohn's disease also increases the risk of blood clots; painful swelling of the lower legs can be a sign of [[deep venous thrombosis]], while difficulty breathing may be a result of [[pulmonary embolism]]. [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]], a condition in which the immune system attacks the [[red blood cells]], is also more common in Crohn's disease and may cause fatigue, pallor, and other symptoms common in [[anemia]]. [[Clubbing]], a deformity of the ends of the fingers, may also be a result of Crohn's disease. Finally, Crohn's disease may cause [[osteoporosis]], or thinning of the bones. Individuals with osteoporosis are at increased risk of [[bone fracture]]s.<ref name=Bernstein>{{cite journal | last = Bernstein | first = Michael | coauthors = Sue Irwin and Gordon R. Greenberg | year = 2005 | title = Maintenance infliximab treatment is associated with improved bone mineral density in Crohn's disease | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 100 | issue = 9 | pages = 2031–5. | doi =10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.50219.x | pmid = 16128948 }}</ref>

Crohn's disease can also cause neurological complications (reportedly in up to 15% of patients).<ref name="pro">[http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/inflammatory_crohn.html Crohn's disease]. professionals.epilepsy.com. Retrieved on [[July 13]], [[2007]].</ref> The most common of these are [[seizures]], [[stroke]], [[myopathy]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[headache]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="pro"/>

Crohn's patients often also have issues with [[Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome]], which has similar symptoms.<ref>{{MedlinePlus|000222|Small bowel bacterial overgrowth}}</ref>

===Complications===
[[Image:Colorectal cancer endo 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Colonoscopy|Endoscopic]] image of '''colon cancer''' identified in the sigmoid [[colon (anatomy)]] on screening [[colonoscopy]] for Crohn's disease.]]
Crohn's disease can lead to several mechanical complications within the intestines, including [[obstruction]], [[fistulae]], and [[abscess]]es. Obstruction typically occurs from [[strictures]] or [[adhesions]] which narrow the lumen, blocking the passage of the intestinal contents. Fistulae can develop between two loops of bowel, between the bowel and bladder, between the bowel and vagina, and between the bowel and skin. Abscesses are walled off collections of [[infection]], which can occur in the [[abdomen]] or in the [[wiktionary:perianal|perianal]] area in Crohn's disease sufferers.

Crohn's disease also increases the risk of cancer in the area of inflammation. For example, individuals with Crohn's disease involving the [[small bowel]] are at higher risk for [[small intestinal cancer]]. Similarly, people with Crohn's colitis have a [[relative risk]] of 5.6 for developing [[colon cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ekbom A, Helmick C, Zack M, Adami H |title=Increased risk of large-bowel cancer in Crohn's disease with colonic involvement |journal=Lancet |volume=336 |issue=8711 |pages=357–9 |year=1990 |pmid=1975343 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(90)91889-I}}</ref> Screening for colon cancer with [[colonoscopy]] is recommended for anyone who has had Crohn's colitis for eight years, or more.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Collins P, Mpofu C, Watson A, Rhodes J | title = Strategies for detecting colon cancer and/or dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = | pages = CD000279 | year = 2006| pmid = 16625534 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000279.pub3}}</ref>

Individuals with Crohn's disease are at risk of [[malnutrition]] for many reasons, including decreased food intake and [[malabsorption]]. The risk increases following resection of the [[small bowel]]. Such individuals may require oral supplements to increase their caloric intake, or in severe cases, [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN). Most people with moderate or severe Crohn's disease are referred to a [[dietitian]] for assistance in nutrition.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Evans J, Steinhart A, Cohen Z, McLeod R | title = Home total parenteral nutrition: an alternative to early surgery for complicated inflammatory bowel disease | journal = J Gastrointest Surg | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 562–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12763417 | doi = 10.1016/S1091-255X(02)00132-4}}</ref>

Crohn's disease can cause significant complications including [[bowel obstruction]], abscesses, free [[Bowel perforation|perforation]] and [[hemorrhage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livingwithcrohnsdisease.com/livingwithcrohnsdisease/crohns_disease/complications_of_crohns.html|title=Complications of Crohn's Disease|accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>

Crohn's disease can be problematic during [[pregnancy]], and some medications can cause adverse outcomes for the [[fetus]] or mother. Consultation with an obstetrician and gastroenterologist about Crohn's disease and all medications allows preventative measures to be taken. In some cases, remission can occur during pregnancy. Certain medications can also impact [[sperm count]] or may otherwise adversely affect a man's ability to [[Fertilisation|conceive]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ccfa.org/about/news/pregnancy | publisher = [[Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America]] | date = 2005-10-21 | title = IBD and Pregnancy: What You Need to Know | last = Kaplan | first = C | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}</ref>

==Cause==
[[Image:NOD2 CARD15.svg|right|thumb|200px|Schematic of NOD2 CARD15 gene, which is associated with certain disease patterns in Crohn's disease]]

The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, environmental and genetic factors have been invoked in the [[pathogenesis]] of the disease. Research has indicated that Crohn's disease has a strong genetic link.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ccfa.org/reuters/geneticlink | title = Crohn's disease has strong genetic link: study | publisher = [[Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America]] | date = 2007-04-16 | accessdate = 2008-04-20 }}</ref> The disease runs in families and those with a sibling with the disease are 30 times more likely to develop it than the normal population. Ethnic background is also a risk factor. Until very recently, whites and European Jews accounted for the vast majority of the cases in the United States, and in most industrialized countries, this demographic is still true. However, the European commission makes an interesting point:

<blockquote>
A review of the literature suggests that Crohn’s disease is more prevalent in Western
populations with northern European and Anglo-Saxon ethnic derivation, than in
populations of southern Europe, Asia and Africa. However, when the Asian people
migrate to urban-industrial societies of the West, they become as susceptible to the
disease as the population of their host countries, suggesting environmental factors in
the aetiology of Crohn’s disease143.<ref name=scah_out38>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out38_en.pdf |title=Possible links between Crohn’s disease and Paratuberculosis

[[Mutation]]s in the [[CARD15]] gene (also known as the NOD2 [[gene]]) are associated with Crohn's disease<!-- --><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ogura Y, Bonen DK, Inohara N, ''et al'' |title=A frameshift mutation in NOD2 associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6837 |pages=603–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11385577 |doi=10.1038/35079114 |url=}}</ref> and with susceptibility to certain phenotypes of disease location and activity.<ref><!--

A handful of cases of Crohn's disease cases were reported at the turn of the 20th century, but since then, the disease has continued to increase in prevalence dramatically. Some argue that this increase has been the result of a genetic shift in the population caused by conditions favoring individuals carrying the genes linked with the disease. These conditions could be a lower infant mortality rate or better health care in the nations that have the highest incidence of disease (industrialized nations). Another explanation is that modern industrial practices have given rise to increased disease prevalence via infectious diseases.  A common recurrent theory is that a specific species of [[Mycobacterium]], [[Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis]], is responsible for both [[Johne's disease]] and Crohn's disease, and modern industrial farming practices have led to the spread of [[Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis]].<ref name=scah_out38/>

Others argue that Crohn's disease is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Many environmental factors have also been hypothesized as causes or risk factors for Crohn's disease. Proven environmental risk factors include living in an industrialized country, smoking, and living in an urban area. Diets high in sweet, [[fat]]ty or [[Food processing|refined foods]] may also play a role. A retrospective Japanese study found that those diagnosed with Crohn's disease had higher intakes of sugar, fat, fish and shellfish than controls prior to diagnosis.<!--

The introduction of [[hormonal contraception]] in the United States in the 1960s is linked with a dramatic increase in the incidence rate of Crohn's disease.

Additionally, many in the scientific community believe that early childhood exposure to illness is necessary to the creation of a proper immune system for those with the genetic susceptibility for Crohn's Disease. Higher incidences of Crohn's Disease are associated with cleaner living conditions. Throughout the early and mid-20th century in the United States, the disease was strongly associated with upper-class populations, and today the disease does not yet exist in the many [[Third World]] countries, despite the fact that it occurs in all races. CD is also associated with first born and single children (because they would have less exposure to childhood illness from siblings) and in populations that have low incidences of gastric cancer. [[Gastric cancer]] is most often caused by the bacterium [[Helicobacter pylori]] that flourishes in cramped and unsanitary conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morris|first= Danielle L|coauthors=Scott M Montgomery|date=2000-11-18|title=Early environmental factors may have role in both Crohn's disease and gastric carcinoma - Letter to the Editor|journal=British Medical Journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0999/is_7271_321/ai_67708495/|accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Crohn's transmural path.jpg|thumb|right|80px|Section of [[colectomy]] showing transmural inflammation]]

At the time of [[colonoscopy]], [[Biopsy|biopsies]] of the colon are often taken in order to confirm the diagnosis. There are certain characteristic features of the [[pathology]] seen that point toward Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease shows a transmural pattern of [[inflammation]], meaning that the inflammation may span the entire depth of the intestinal wall.<ref name=Hanauer/> Grossly, [[ulcer]]ation is an outcome seen in highly active disease. There is usually an abrupt transition between unaffected tissue and the ulcer. Under a microscope, biopsies of the affected colon may show [[mucosa]]l inflammation. This inflammation is characterized by focal infiltration of [[neutrophils]], a type of inflammatory cell, into the [[epithelium]]. This typically occurs in the area overlying [[lymphoid tissue|lymphoid]] aggregates. These neutrophils, along with [[lymphocyte|mononuclear cells]], may infiltrate into the [[Crypts of Lieberkuhn|crypts]] leading to inflammation (crypititis) or abscess (crypt abscess). [[Granuloma]]s, aggregates of [[macrophage]] derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn's disease. The granulomas of Crohn's disease do not show "caseation", a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination that is characteristic of granulomas associated with infections such as [[tuberculosis]]. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal [[villus|villi]], atypical branching of the crypts, and change in the tissue type ([[metaplasia]]). One example of such metaplasia, ''Paneth cell metaplasia'', involves development of Paneth cells (typically found in the small intestine) in other parts of the gastrointestinal system.<ref name=Robbins>Crawford JM. "The Gastrointestinal tract, Chapter 17". In Cotran RS, Kumar V, Robbins SL. ''Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease: 5th Edition''. W.B. Saunders and Company, Philadelphia, 1994.</ref>

According to the volume 1 of the 10th Edition of Brunner and Suddarth’s Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing Regional enteritis is a subacute and chronic inflammation that extends through the layers (ie, transmural lesion) of the bowel wall from the intestinal mucosa. It is characterized by periods of remissions and exacerbations. The disease process begins with edema and thickening of the mucosa. Ulcers begin to appear on the inflamed mucosa. These lesions are not in continuous contact with one another and are separated by normal tissue. Fistulas, fissures, and abscesses form as the inflammation extends into the peritoneum. Granulomas occur in one half of patients. In advanced cases, the intestinal mucosa has a cobblestone appearance. As the disease advances, the bowel wall thickens and becomes fibrotic, and the intestinal lumen narrows. Diseased bowel loops sometimes adhere to other loops surrounding them.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of Crohn's disease can sometimes be challenging,<ref name=Pimentel/> and a number of tests are often required to assist the physician in making the diagnosis.<ref name=emed/> Even with a full battery of tests it may not be possible to diagnose Crohn's with complete certainty; a colonoscopy is approximately 70% effective in diagnosing the disease with further being less effective. Disease in the small bowel is particularly difficult to diagnose as a traditional colonoscopy only allows access to the colon and lower portions of the small intestines; introduction of the [[Capsule endoscopy]]<ref>[http://www.givenimaging.com/en-us/HealthcareProfessionals/Pages/pageHCP.aspx HCP: Pill Cam, Capsule Endoscopy, Esophageal Endoscopy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> aids in endoscopic diagnosis.

===Endoscopy===
A [[colonoscopy]] is the best test for making the diagnosis of Crohn's disease as it allows direct visualization of the colon and the [[terminal ileum]], identifying the pattern of disease involvement. Occasionally, the colonoscope can travel past the terminal ileum but it varies from patient to patient. During the procedure, the [[gastroenterologist]] can also perform a [[biopsy]], taking small samples of tissue for laboratory analysis which may help confirm a diagnosis. As 30% of Crohn's disease involves only the ileum,<ref name=Hanauer/> [[cannula]]tion of the terminal ileum is required in making the diagnosis. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum but not the [[rectum]], is suggestive of Crohn's disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata.<!-- is passed in the patient's faeces. It has been used in the search for Crohn's disease in the small bowel, which cannot be reached with colonoscopy or gastroscopy.<!--

===Radiologic tests===
A [[barium follow-through|small bowel follow-through]] may suggest the diagnosis of Crohn's disease and is useful when the disease involves only the small intestine. Because colonoscopy and [[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscopy]] allow direct visualization of only the terminal ileum and beginning of the [[duodenum]], they cannot be used to evaluate the remainder of the small intestine.

===Comparison with ulcerative colitis===
The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of Crohn's disease is [[ulcerative colitis]], as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as '''indeterminate colitis'''.<ref name=Podolsky/><ref name=Hanauer/><ref name=emed/>

Acute treatment uses medications to treat any infection (normally [[antibiotic]]s) and to reduce inflammation (normally [[Aminosalicylic acid|aminosalicylate]] anti-inflammatory drugs and [[corticosteroid]]s). When symptoms are in remission, treatment enters maintenance with a goal of avoiding the recurrence of symptoms. Prolonged use of corticosteroids has significant [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]]; as a result they are generally not used for long-term treatment. Alternatives include aminosalicylates alone, though only a minority are able to maintain the treatment, and many require immunosuppressive drugs.<ref name="HanauerCrohns"/>

Medications used to treat the symptoms of Crohn's disease include [[mesalazine|5-aminosalicylic acid]] (5-ASA) formulations, [[prednisone]], immunomodulators such as [[azathioprine]], [[mercaptopurine]], [[methotrexate]], [[infliximab]], [[adalimumab]]<ref name=Podolsky>{{Cite journal|last=Podolsky|first= Daniel K.|title=Inflammatory bowel disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=2002|volume=346|issue=6|pages=417–29

===Lifestyle changes===
Certain lifestyle changes can reduce symptoms, including [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] adjustments, proper [[hydration]] and [[smoking cessation]].<ref name = WebMD/>

===Surgery===
Crohn's cannot be cured by [[surgery]], though it is used when partial or a full blockage of the intestine occurs. Surgery may also be required for complications such as obstructions, fistulas and/or abscesses, or if the disease does not respond to drugs within a reasonable time. After the first surgery, Crohn's usually shows up at the site of the resection though it can appear in other locations. After a resection, scar tissue builds up which causes strictures. A stricture is when the intestines becomes too small to allow excrement to pass through easily which can lead to a blockage. After the first resection, another resection may be necessary within five years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ibdcrohns.about.com/od/surgeryprocedures/a/resectioncrohns.htm | title = Resection Surgery for Crohn's Disease | publisher = [[About.com]] | accessdate = 2008-02-14 | date = 2007-01-12 | last = Tresca | first = AJ }}</ref> For patients with an obstruction due to a stricture, two options for treatment are strictureplasty and resection of that portion of bowel. There is no [[statistical significance]] between strictureplasty alone versus strictureplasty and resection in cases of [[Duodenum|duodenal]] involvement. In these cases, re-operation rates were 31% and 27%, respectively, indicating that strictureplasty is a safe and effective treatment for selected patients with duodenal involvement.<ref name="pmid8918424">{{cite journal | author = Ozuner G, Fazio VW, Lavery IC, Milsom JW, Strong SA | title = Reoperative rates for Crohn's disease following strictureplasty.

[[Short bowel syndrome]] (SBS, also short gut syndrome or simply short gut) can be caused by the surgical removal of the small intestines.  It usually develops if a person has had half or more of their small intestines removed.<ref>[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/shortbowel/ Short Bowel Syndrome] as defined by the [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]]</ref> Diarrhea is the main symptom of short bowel syndrome though other symptoms may include cramping, bloating and heartburn.  Short bowel syndrome is treated with changes in diet, intravenous feeding, vitamin and mineral supplements and treatment with medications.

===Prospective treatments===
Researchers at [[University College London]] have questioned the wisdom of suppressing the immune system in Crohn's, as the problem may be an under-active rather than an over-active immune system: their study found that Crohn's patients showed an abnormally low response to an introduced infection, marked by a poor flow of blood to the wound, and the response improved when the patients were given [[sildenafil]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Segal AW et al | title = Defective acute inflammation in Crohn's disease: a clinical investigation | journal = Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9511 | pages = 668–78 | year = 2006| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68265-2}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Crohn's disease is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] condition for which there is currently no cure. It is characterised by periods of improvement followed by episodes when symptoms flare up. With treatment, most people achieve a healthy height and weight, and the mortality rate for the disease is low. Crohn's disease is associated with an increased risk of small bowel and colorectal carcinoma.<ref name=Canavan>{{cite journal | last = Canavan | first = C. | coauthors = K. R. Abrams, J.

Crohn's disease has a [[bimodal distribution]] in [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] as a function of age: the disease tends to strike people in their teens and 20s, and people in their 50s through to their 70s, and ages in between due to not being diagnosed with Crohn's and being diagnosed instead with [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS).<ref name=Hanauer/><ref name=emed/> It is rarely diagnosed in early childhood.

==History==
Inflammatory bowel diseases were described by [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]] (1682-1771), by Polish surgeon [[Antoni Leśniowski]] in 1904 (leading to the use of the eponym "'''Leśniowski-Crohn disease'''" in [[Poland]]) and by [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician T. Kennedy Dalziel in 1913.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirsner JB |title=Historical aspects of inflammatory bowel disease |journal=J. Clin. Gastroenterol. |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=286–97 |year=1988 |pmid=2980764 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

[[Burrill Bernard Crohn]], an American gastroenterologist at [[New York City]]'s [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], described fourteen cases in 1932, and submitted them to the [[American Medical Association]] under the rubric of "Terminal ileitis: A new clinical entity". Later that year, he, along with colleagues Leon Ginzburg and Gordon Oppenheimer published the case series as "Regional ileitis: a pathologic and clinical entity".<ref name=CrohnBB/>
