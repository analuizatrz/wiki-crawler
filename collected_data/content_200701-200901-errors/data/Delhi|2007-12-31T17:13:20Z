Having been the capital of several [[empire]]s in [[History of India|ancient India]], Delhi was a major city in the old [[trade route]]s from northwest India to the [[Gangetic Plains]].

During the [[British Raj]],  [[New Delhi]] was built as an administrative quarter of the city. New Delhi was declared the capital of India after India gained [[History of the Republic of India|independence]] from British rule in 1947. As the seat of the Government of India, New Delhi houses important offices of the federal government, including the [[Parliament of India]], making Delhi a powerhouse of [[Indian politics]]. 

Delhi has grown up to be a [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] city owing to the immigration of people from across the country. Like many other large cities of the world, Delhi suffers from urbanisation problems such as pollution, traffic congestion, and scarcity of resources<ref>

Delhi has four major satellite cities which lie outside the National Capital Territory of Delhi. These are [[Gurgaon]] and [[Faridabad]] (in Haryana), and [[New Okhla Industrial Development Authority|NOIDA]] and [[Ghaziabad]] (in Uttar Pradesh). Delhi is divided into nine districts. Each district (division) is headed by a Deputy Commissioner and has three subdivisions. A Subdivision Magistrate heads each subdivision. All Deputy Commissioners report to the Divisional Commissioner. The District Administration of Delhi is the enforcing department for all kinds of State and Central Government policies and exercises supervisory powers over numerous other functionaries of the Government.

The [[Delhi High Court]] has jurisdiction over Delhi. Delhi also has [[lower court]]s; the [[Small Causes Court]] for civil cases, and the [[Sessions Court]] for criminal cases.

==Government and politics==

[[Image:NorthBlock.jpg|thumb|right|The [[North Block]], in [[New Delhi]], houses key government offices]]

As a special Union Territory, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, Council of Ministers and Chief Minister. The legislative assembly seats are filled by direct election from territorial constituencies in the NCT. However, the Union Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi. The legislative assembly was re-established in 1993 for the first time since 1956, with direct federal rule in the span. In addition, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj act. New Delhi, an urban area in Delhi, is the seat of both the State Government of Delhi and the Government of India. The [[Parliament of India]], the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]] (Presidential Palace) and the [[Supreme Court of India]] are located in New Delhi.

Delhi was a traditional stronghold of the [[Indian National Congress]], also known as the Congress Party. In the 1990s the [[BJP|Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) under the leadership of [[Madan Lal Khurana]] came into power. However in 1998, Congress regained power. [[Sheila Dixit]] of Congress is the incumbent Chief Minister. The Congress retained power in the Legislative Assembly in the 2003 election as well by a large margin. However, in 2007, the BJP scored a crushing victory over the ruling Congress in the MCD election, signalling a near certain return to power in the elections of Dec, 2008. Both parties have advocated full-fledged statehood for Delhi, but the process to establish this has been slow.

The water supply in Delhi is managed by the [[Delhi Jal Board]] (DJB).

The DVB itself cannot generate adequate power to meet the city's demand and borrows power from India's Northern Region Grid. As a result, Delhi faces a power shortage resulting in frequent [[power outage|blackouts and brownouts]], especially during the summer season when energy demand is at its peak. Several industrial units in Delhi rely on their own electrical generators to meet their electric demand and for back up during Delhi's frequent and disruptive power cuts. A few years ago, the power sector in Delhi was handed over to private companies. The distribution of electricity is carried out by companies run by TATA'S & Reliance Energy Ltd. in Delhi.

[[Image:DelhiMetro.jpg|thumb|Delhi metro, operated by the [[Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited]]]]
The [[Delhi Metro]], a mass rapid transit system, serves many parts of Delhi. As of 2007, the metro operates three lines with a total length of 65&nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]] (40&nbsp;[[mile]]s) and 59 stations while several other lines are under construction.<ref name=metrostations>{{cite web| url = http://www.delhimetrorail.com/commuters/station_information.html

[[Railways]] served only 1% of the local traffic until 2003.<ref name=ecosurv12/> However Delhi is a major junction in the [[:Image:India railway schematic map.svg|rail map of India]] and is the headquarters of the [[Northern Railway (India)|Northern Railway]].

[[Auto rickshaws]] are an important and popular means of public transportation in Delhi, as they charge a lower fare than taxis. Most run on [[Compressed Natural Gas]] and are yellow and green in colour.

[[Taxicab|Taxi]]s are not an integral part of Delhi public transport, though they are easily available. The DTC, the Indian Tourism Ministry and various private operators operate most taxis. The Tourism Ministry grants private companies permits to operate taxis.

Delhi's high population growth rate, coupled with high economic growth rate has resulted in an ever increasing demand for transport creating excessive pressure on the city's existent transport infrastructure. In order to meet the transport demand in Delhi, the State and Union government started the construction of a mass rapid transit system, including the [[Delhi Mass Rapid Transit System|Delhi Metro]].<ref name=ecosurv12/> In 1998, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ordered all public transport vehicles to use [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) as fuel instead of diesel and other hydro-carbons.<ref name=supremelaw>{{cite web
