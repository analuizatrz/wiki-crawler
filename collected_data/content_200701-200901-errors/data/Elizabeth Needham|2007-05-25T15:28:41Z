'''Elizabeth Needham''' (also known as '''Mother Needham''') was a notorious English procuress and brothel-keeper of 18th century London, who appeared in the first of [[William Hogarth]]'s series of satirical etchings, ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]''.

Nothing is known of her early life, but by the time she was middle-aged she was renowned in London as the keeper of a [[brothel]] in Park Place, St. James. Hogarth described her as a "handsome old Procuress...well dressed in silk", but mentions "patches on her face" and in his picture her face is seen to be pock-marked. She went by a number of aliases: Bird, Howard, Blewitt and Trent. She was apparently ruthless with the girls who worked for her. They were forced to hire their dresses from her, and, if they were unable to pay the exorbitant rentals, she would force them to take more customers or have them committed to [[debtor's prison|debtors' prison]] until they met her demands (a scheme [[John Cleland]]'s heroine falls prey to in ''Fanny Hill''). Once they were too old or too ill, she threw them out.<ref name="WL">{{cite book|title=London - The Wicked City: A Thousand Years of Prostitution and Vice|author=Fergus Linnane|publisher=Robson Books Ltd|location=|date=2003|id=ISBN 978-1861056191|pages=109-111}}</ref>

She procured her girls from many sources (even, it appears, from auctions), but particularly targeted girls fresh from the country. The essayist [[Richard Steele]] found her pitching to a newly-arrived girl when he went to meet a wagon bringing him items from the countryside. He described her as "artful", and it seems that she was friendly and engaging with her potential employees, revealing her vicious character only when they were under her roof; in ''[[The Dunciad]]'', [[Alexander Pope]] warns not to "...lard your words with Mother Needham's style".<ref name="WL" />

Chief among her customers were [[Francis Charteris (Scottish aristocrat)|Colonel Francis Charteris]] and his cousin the [[Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton|Duke of Wharton]] - Charteris is lounging in the doorway behind Needham in Hogarth's picture.<ref name="WL" /> [[Sally Salisbury]], the preeminent prostitute of the day and former mistress of Charteris, became a member of Needham's household after her previous bawd, Mother Wisebourne died, and brought with her a clientele from the highest ranks of society.<ref name="TO">{{cite book|title=The Thieves' Opera|publisher=Harvest Books|author=Lucy Moore|date=2000|pages=304|id=ISBN 0156006405}}</ref> Some idea of the prestige of Needham's house can be gathered by one of ''[[Joe Miller (actor)|Joe Miller's Jests]]'', which involves her asking her landlord to wait for his money until [[British Parliament|Parliament]] and the [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]] sit at which point she will be able to pay him ten times over.<ref>{{cite book|title=Joe Miller's Jests|editor=John Motley|author=Joe Miller (attrib.)|date=1790|publisher=William Lane|location=London|pages=144}}</ref> Her well-connected clientele may have allowed her to escape arrest, and the first time she was raided was in 1724:
{{bquote|Yesterday morning the celebrated Mother Needham and Mother Bird, two eminent ''conservators of the Game of the Kingdom'', were committed to Newgate; their houses being disturb’d the night before by the Constables, who disengaged the Gentlemen and Ladies to a great number, and carried them to the Round-House. This being the first time Mrs Needham ever received publick correction, since her being at the head of venal affairs in this town, ’tis thought will be the ruin of her houshold.

Her punishment on this occasion is not recorded, but in September, while she was still incarcerated, her house burned down, killing one of the inhabitants, Captain Barbute, a French officer. In 1728, several of her girls were arrested, but she appears to have escaped punishment. After being arrested by Sir [[John Gonson]],<ref>{{cite book|title=London's Underworld: Three Centuries of Vice and Crime|author=Fergus Linnane |publisher=Robson Books|pages=372|date=2005|id=ISBN 1861057423}}</ref> she was convicted of keeping a disorderly house on [[29 April]] [[1731]], fined one [[shilling]] and sentenced to stand twice in the [[pillory]], and "to find sureties for her good behaviour for 3 years".<ref name="MN" /> On [[30 April]] she was taken to the pillory for the first time. Perhaps because of her connections, she was allowed to lie face down in front of the pillory and a number of guards were paid to protect her. Despite this she received such a pelting that it was thought likely she would die before her punishment was completed.<ref name="WL" /> She was taken out, but died on [[3 May]] [[1731]], the day before she was due to stand in the pillory for the second time. In her last words she apparently expressed great fear at having to stand in the pillory again after the severe punishment she had received the first time.<ref name="MN" /> Hogarth was still at work on ''A Harlot's Progress'' when she died, so she never saw herself immortalised.<ref name="HG">{{cite web|url=http://hogarth.chez-alice.fr/gallery01.htm|title=A Harlot's Progress|publisher=Hogarth's Realm|author=Neil McWilliam|accessdaymonth=09 January|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
