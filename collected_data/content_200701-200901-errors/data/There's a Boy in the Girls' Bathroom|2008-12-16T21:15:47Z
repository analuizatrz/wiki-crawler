==Characters==
* '''Bradley Chalkers''' - Considered the meanest kid in school, and no one wants to talk to him, however after he meets Carla he realizes that if he believes the people who call him a "monster", then that is what he will become. He must believe in himself.
* '''Jeff Fishkin''' - Colleen's crush and the new kid. Has a habit of automatically saying "Hello" or "Hi" to people when they greet him. He becomes Bradley's friend, only because he was paid a dollar. Later, he rejects him for cooler friends. After Bradley starts acting nicer, he and Jeff become friends again.
* '''Colleen Verigold''' - Jeff's crush. She has a birthday at the end of the story and invites all her friends, as well as Jeff and Bradley.
* '''Melinda Birch''' - Colleen's tough best friend. Fights with Bradley frequently, although she likes him better by the end of the book.
* '''Lori Westin''' - the biggest gossip in school. Nicknamed "Lori Loud Mouth" by Brad.
* '''Carla Davis''' - the school counselor. Unlike the teachers at the school, she prefers to persuade students to do the right thing instead of outright telling them what to do. Although students like Jeff, Bradley, and Colleen like her, she is very unpopular among the parents, who believe that a counselor is unnecessary. She is the reason for Bradley's turnaround. She believes in him and gives him confidence.
* '''Mrs. Chalkers''' - Bradley's mother. She cares about him and tries to help him out.
* '''Mr. Chalkers''' - Bradley's father. A former police officer who was shot by a robber and limps as a result. Although he and Bradley fight at the beginning of the book they become closer by the end. Although he originally doesn't like the school having a counselor, he changes his mind when he sees how much she helps Bradley.
* '''Claudia Chalkers''' - Bradley's  14-year-old sister. She usually teases him and is mean. She is occasionally nice however, such as when she buys him Bartholomew after she accidentally breaks Ronnie's ear or when she helps him with his math homework.
* '''Ronnie''' - Bradley's favorite toy animal, a wooden rabbit. She is very real in his imagination, as a funny, happy-go-lucky rabbit that's also in love with Bartholomew. She has a broken ear given to her by Claudia. She can be seen as a personification of the friendship Bradley wants, as he imagines her speaking to him in the same way Carla does.
* '''Bartholomew''' - Bradley's ceramic bear that Claudia bought for him after she broke Ronnie's ear. In Bradley's stories, he's usually the hero, and is in love with Ronnie.He can be seen as a personification of who Bradley wants to be (a hero with lots of friends and someone who loves him). 
* '''Mrs. Ebbel''' - Bradley's teacher. She teaches her class at Room 12. She has very little faith in Bradley to succeed and expresses her concern to Bradley's mother.
