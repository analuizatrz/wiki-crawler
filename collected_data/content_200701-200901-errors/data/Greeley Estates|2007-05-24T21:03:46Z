'''Greeley Estates''' is a [[post-hardcore]]/[[hard rock]] band from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]].

==Biography==

Greeley Estates is one of PureVolume’s top 10 unsigned artists with over 1,300,000 plays– an accolade supported by having album sales in the top 10 on Smartpunk since Oct. 2004. Their distribution record further secured them a position on the Smartpunk chart for “Sales of All Time.” They were on select dates of the [[Vans Warped Tour]] in '05. Greeley Estates' work is featured on the Punk the Clock Vol. 1 & 2 compilations, along with artists such as [[Taking Back Sunday]], Acceptance, [[Mae]], and [[Underoath]]. They have appeared on the 2005 Warped tour compilation as well.

Other accomplishments include: completing 3 U.S. tours since Nov. ‘04, a DVD entitled " The Death of Greeley Estates" released in May '05, playing on the [[Taste Of Chaos]] tour, and continuous radio spins on 103.9 in Phoenix. 

The band also performed on the Hurley Stage for the entirety of the 2006 [[Vans Warped Tour]].

The original drummer for the band was Mike Coburn.  He left the band shortly before they started touring at the end of 2003 to start a family with his wife. Brian Champ soon became the drummer for Greeley Estates.

On January 31st, 2007, bassist Josh Applebach announced that he would leave Greeley Estates for a teaching career in Arizona. The current touring bassist is Bradley Murray (ex-[[Versus the Mirror]]) from [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]]. His first live appearance with the band was on February 3rd, 2007 in [[Safford]], [[Arizona]].
