'''Kizeme''' is a Japanese term describing the advanced form of [[Seme (martial arts)|seme]] when a [[kendo]] player has succeeded in causing shift in  the mind ([[attention]]) of the opponent.<ref>Ki and the Way of the Martial Arts by Kenji Tokitsu, Shambhala, 2003, pp.31-36</ref>  Kendoka at that stage takes the offensive mainly through [[Qi|Ki]], succeeding in disconcerting the opponent via KI-projection and at much higher skill level without visible gesture.<ref>The Technical and Psychological Methodology of Kendo by Oya Minoru, Kendo World 1(4) 2002 pp.5-9, 2(1) 2003, pp.24-7</ref> 

Kizeme is act of combat predominant in Kendo and should be regarded in contrast to ordinary levels of combat  in which the awareness of the practitioners is limited to the most directly perceptible elements: speed, strength and sheer aggressiveness. The last can be used to delineate 3 levels of combat (see the 3 sketches on your right).<ref>Miyamoto Musashi: His Life and Writings, by Kenji Tokitsu, Shambhala, 2004, p.330</ref> These 3 levels were elegantly described in a compelling allegory by Issai Chosan (1727) ''Neko no Myojutsu'' ("The Cat's Eerie Skill").<ref>The Overlook Martial Arts Reader V2 ed. by John Donohue, The Overlook Press, 2004, pp.106-113</ref>  Kizeme is depicted as the perfect skill in martial art, where non-violence is still an artifice that can be detected and exploited to dismiss the naturally embedded aggression in the [[budo|ego]] and reach harmony - the state of [[Muga-mushin]].

An instructive attestation of kizeme can be seen in a demonstration kendo match at [[Noma dojo]] by Moriji Mochida ([[Japanese_numerals|ju]]-dan [[hanshi]]) during the Emperor's Cup (1940).
