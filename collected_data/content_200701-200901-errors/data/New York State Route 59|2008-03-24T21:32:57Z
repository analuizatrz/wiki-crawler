'''New York State Route 59''' is an east-west road in southern [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] in the State of New York. NY 59 runs from [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]], at Exit 15A of the [[New York State Thruway]], in [[Hillburn, New York|Hillburn]], to [[US 9W]] in [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]]. In [[Suffern, New York]], it shares a [[concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 202]] for 0.05 miles. NY 59 runs parallel to the New York State Thruway its entire route. The routing of NY 59 was designated a state highway in 1911 and signed as NY 59 in the late 1920s.

The presence of grade-separated interchanges at NY 304, Strawtown Road ([[County Route 23 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 23]]), Western Highway ([[County Route 15 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 15]]) and [[New York State Route 303|NY 303]], along with the southern half of the formerly proposed '''Spring Valley Bypass''', indicates that it may have been proposed at one time as a toll-free alternative to the Thruway for local, limited-access traffic. NY 59 used to go further east along '''Main Street''' in Nyack to '''North Broadway'''.

==Route description==
[[Image:END! NY 59.jpg|left|thumb|Signs at the 17-59 intersection.]]
NY 59 begins at [[Interstate 87|I-87]] and [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]] in Hillburn, just south of the village of [[Sloatsburg, New York|Sloatsburg]]. For most of its run, NY 59 is a partial freeway also called the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway. The route is labeled an east/west route, but for for the beginning of the route until it hits [[U.S. Route 202]] in [[Suffern, New York]] it runs in a north/south direction. Just before NY 59 changes to a east/west direction, it passes under the [[New York State Thruway]]. This is at the [[I-87]]/[[I-287]] interchange with [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]] and [[Interstate 287|I-287]]. At this underpass, NY 59 enters the village limits of Suffern.<ref name="google">{{cite map|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=2036210090501404969,41.137405,-74.166737%3B16739010844802378770,41.122331,-74.159943%3B4927242213475042011,41.108960,-74.053910%3B8102902720396899452,41.091761,-73.974326%3B14122985737362439143,41.094018,-73.927833&time=&date=&ttype=&saddr=Korean+War+Veterans+Memorial+Hwy%2FRT-17%2FRT-59+%4041.137405,+-74.166737&daddr=Korean+War+Veterans+Memorial+Hwy%2FRT-59+%4041.122331,+-74.159943+to:Korean+War+Veterans+Memorial+Hwy%2FRT-59+%4041.108960,+-74.053910+to:Korean+War+Veterans+Memorial+Hwy%2FRT-59+E+%4041.091761,+-73.974326+to:41.092548,-73.92889&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=4&sz=14&via=1,2,3&sll=41.10044,-73.940048&sspn=0.028329,0.057764&ie=UTF8&ll=41.100569,-74.070511&spn=0.226633,0.462112&z=11&om=0|title=Overview Map of NY 59|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> 

In Suffern, NY 59 has a brief [[wrong way concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 202]] as NY 59 eastbound is paired with US 202 westbound and visa versa. At the end of the brief concurrency, NY 59 turns eastward toward central Rockland County, and US 202 heads into New Jersey. As NY 59 leaves Suffern and enters [[Airmont, New York|Airmont]] it passes Good Samaritan Hospital, which is a major hospital in Rockland. While in Airmont, NY 59 intersects [[County Route 89 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 89]] and [[County Route 85 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 85]]. After leaving Airmont, NY 59 proceeds east through [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]]. Here it intersects the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 306|NY 306]]. This is a pretty busy interchange in downtown Monsey.<ref name="google"/> 

[[Image:NY45atNY59Junction.jpg|thumb|right|NY 45 at NY 59 in Spring Valley. A mile to the east, NY 59 intersects the [[New York State Thruway|Thruway]].]]
As NY 59 passes Spring Valley High School, it enters the village limits of Spring Valley. While, in Spring Valley, NY 59 has an overlap with [[County Route 35A (Rockland County, New York)|CR 35A]] for about a tenth of a mile. In Spring Valley, NY 59 has its second interchange with the NY Thruway (Exit 14). Only the NY Thruway northbound is accessible here, but for those wanting to go southbound need to drive past the Nanuet town line. In Nanuet, NY 59 passes through a heavy commercialized area. Before its busy intersection with [[County Route 33 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 33]], NY 59 passes the Nanuet Mall to its south and the Rockland Plaza to its north.<ref name="google"/>

Upon entering [[West Nyack, New York|West Nyack]], NY 59 intersects the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway|PIP]] (Exit 8) and [[New York State Route 304|NY 304]]. The route then passes the [[Palisades Center Mall]], which one of the largest shopping malls in the country. Immediately after passing the Palisades Center, NY 59 briefly enters [[Central Nyack, New York|Central Nyack]]. Here it has a traditional interchange with [[New York State Route 303|NY 303]]. Before hitting the [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] townline, NY 59 has its third and final interchange with the NY Thruway. The southbound entrance to the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] is via Mountainview Avenue, and the northbound entrance is via Polhemus Street. At the Nyack line, NY 59 becomes known as Main Street. As Main Street, NY 59 runs under the [[New York State Thruway]] one final time before the Thruway heads over the bridge. Finally, NY 59 comes to its end at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 9W]] in Nyack. Main Street continues into downtown Nyack.<ref name="google"/>

[[Image:NY59bridge.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The bridge at New York State Route 59 near its western terminus in [[Hillburn, New York|Hillburn]]]]
NY Route 59 originated as the '''Nyack Turnpike''', which was the first major thoroughfare in Rockland County.<ref name="nyack">{{cite news|author=Andrea Rubin|title=Take the main road from
the Hudson to Hillburn (and back)|work=[[The Journal News]]|date=[[2002-10-22]]}}</ref> Stemming from an 1813 petition, legislation was passed on [[April 17]], [[1816]] to begin construction on the Nyack Turnpike. In the 1830s, after many years of opposition, the Nyack Turnpike was completed from Suffern to Nyack. Its charter was renewed multiple times throughout the 19th century, and was designated as a toll road to help pay for its upkeep. In 1894, the turnpike was absorbed into the [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] road system.<ref name="Nannariello">{{cite web|author=Lynn  Nannariello|publisher=Rockland County Government|url=http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/Arts/Turnpike.html|title=Its About Time|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>

The turnpike was turned over from the county to [[New York State]] on [[July 14]], [[1911]]<ref name="Nannariello" /> and added to the state highway system as part of '''Route 39-b''', a legislative route extending from [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] (at Broadway) to [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]] via modern NY 59 and [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hZ4AAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0BO0d1_wjEj48SYL7L#PPA68,M1|author=State of New York Commission of Highways|title=The Highway Law|year=1919|accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref> When state highways in New York were first signed in 1924, the portion of legislative Route 39-b between Nyack and [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]] was not given a number.<ref name=1924nyt>{{cite news|title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1924-12-21]]|page=XX9}}</ref> It remained unnumbered until the late 1920s when it was signed as NY 59. At the time, NY 59 extended east into Nyack along Main Street to meet [[U.S. Route 9W]] at Broadway. Between [[Nanuet, New York|Nanuet]] and [[Central Nyack, New York|Central Nyack]], NY 59 was routed on West Nyack Road.<ref name=1926map>{{cite map|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewJersey/unitedstates1926ra_010.html|title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas (northern New Jersey)|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|year=1926|accessdate=2008-01-06}}</ref><ref name=1929map>{{cite map |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/bluebook1929_009.html |title=Automobile Blue Book (New York City vicinity) |year=1929 |publisher=Automobile Blue Book Inc. |accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> The route was rendered unchanged in the [[1930 New York State Route renumbering]].<ref name="news">{{cite news|author=Leon A.

During the 1960s, the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT) noticed a population boom in Rockland County. Therefore, a toll-free, limited-access highway ('''Spring Valley Bypass''') was planned to bypass Spring Valley. This was planned as a "J" shaped road along the east side of existing NY 45 and the south side of NY 59. The southwest end would have been at the intersection of NY 59 and 306 in [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], while the north end would have been somewhere along NY 45 in [[New Square, New York|New Square]]. This may have also included a northern extension of the [[Garden State Parkway]]. However, it was cancelled due to public opposition.<ref name="NYCRoads2">{{cite web|publisher=NYCRoads|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/NY-45/|title=Spring Valley Bypass History @ NYCRoads.com|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>

With the Spring Valley Bypass plan being cancelled, traffic continued to pour through the Spring Valley/Nanuet area. In 1987, a task force was introduced to come up with a plan to solve this issue.  Traffic would become even worse when the Nanuet Mall expanded in 1994. The [[New York State Department of Transportation]] tried to fix the worsening situation in 1995, when they reconstructed almost 3 miles of Route 59 from the eastern border of Spring Valley to Exit 8 of the Palisades State Parkway. The project widened the road to six lanes, helping to move traffic through the area from Grandview to Middletown Roads in Nanuet.<ref name="nyack"/> In 1997, the New York State Thruway dropped the Spring Valley toll for all motorists except truckers. This helped reduce traffic on NY 59 between exits 14A and 14B.<ref name="nyack"/>

Shortly after the traffic problems in Nanuet were reduced, the focus was shifted to West Nyack where the [[Palisades Center Mall]] was being constructed. First proposed in the late 1980s, construction finally started in 1995. This caused major delays for motorists when a bridge was constructed from NY 59 to the Palisades Mall south parking lot.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite web|publisher=New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDD1630F932A05751C1A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|title=Plan to Build Huge Mall Under Attack in Rockland|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> To keep this portion of NY 59 from being overloaded with mall goers, Exit 12 of the NY Thruway with NY 303 was re-routed through the Palisades Mall via Palisades Center Drive.<ref name="Perry">{{cite web|publisher=N.W.
