'''''Colectivo''''' is the name given in [[Argentina]] to public transportation vehicles, especially those of Argentina's [[capital|capital city]], [[Buenos Aires]]. They represent one of the best-known traditions of the city. 

When they first appeared in the [[1920s]], colectivos were small [[bus|buses]] built out of smaller vehicle chassis (cars, vans, etc.) and, later, out of truck chassis (1950&ndash;1990, by [[Mercedes-Benz]] Argentina). 
Colectivos used to be built on top of units not specifically designed for the transportation of people and were decorated with unique hand painted "graphics" ''([[fileteado]])'' that gave each unit a distinct flavor and added a colorful touch to Buenos Aires' streets.

Their evolution and size growth was steady and they kept their own picturesque style until [[1990]], when the urban fleet was modernized with real [[Bus|Omnibus]] units (with motors in the back) and much of the charm was lost. 

Together with [[football (soccer)|football]], urban landmarks (like the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires Obelisk]]) and [[Tango (dance)|tango]], the colectivo was, until the [[1990s]], one of the big tourist draws of Buenos Aires. Because of its golden times the ''colectivo'' is loved by the citizens of Buenos Aires. A colectivo historian concluded after his extensive study<ref>[http://www.busarg.com.ar/evolucion.htm The design evolution of the Colectivo] accessed [[5 September]] [[2005]] {{Sp icon}}</ref>:

<blockquote>''The colectivo is considered a source of pride for the national ego (identity), the same one that makes an Argentinian proud that his countrymen invented the [[birome]] ([[ballpoint pen]]) and [[dulce de leche]], and that his city's avenues include the longest in the world ([[Rivadavia Avenue]]) as well as the widest ([[9 de Julio Avenue]])
</blockquote>

==History==
===1930&ndash;1950===
'''Taxi-bus, car-bus, van-bus. Creation of the "líneas'''

In the [[1900s]] Argentina was the "Granary of the World", one of the largest world food producers and exporters, and a wealthy country. The streets of prosperous Buenos Aires (with 2 million inhabitants) soon filled with cars.
Commercial relations with the [[United Kingdom]] (mainly trade in meat and grain), also brought a myriad of investors and enterprises in the early years of the century, including [[Latin America]]'s [[Buenos Aires Metro|first metro system]], [[car]]s, [[train]]s, [[tram|tramway]]s, [[taxicab|taxi]]s and public buses.

[[Image:Colectivo Clasico.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Smaller vintage Chevrolet model]]
But in [[1929]] the [[Great Depression]] hit, and the local cab owners attempted a radical change. They modified their taxi units, widening the back seats to allow more than one passenger per trip, and established pre-defined itineraries and stops, at a lower price per passenger. Every day, the drivers deliberately challenged the "real" public buses and electrical tramways, parking near them at the busiest stations and driving close to them during the day to pick up their passengers. Soon people started to prefer these colectivos and the original buses and tramways became part of history. Thus the original Argentine colectivo was born.
With time, these routes were formalized and owners of individual units grouped into líneas (''lines'') that operated a particular route. Since several lines often shared avenues and roads, companies began to adopt different colors to distinguish their units and not depend only on their assigned numbers (up to 3 digits) because they were often hard to see in the crowded streets. The [[Colectivo 60|Line 60]] had it's beginnings in this era and, with it, a legend was born.

Popular demand in the [[1930s]] propelled the size of the colectivo from five to up to a dozen seats but the picturesque external chassis designs remained in the original styles, which were kept until the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]] (by which time the units had twenty seats).

===1950&ndash;1990===
'''Mercedes-Benz truck and buses'''

After [[World War II]] and during the [[1950s]], Argentine industry started to develop again but the country's public transport system was inadequate for the new era: practically no modernization had taken place since the early years, and the train system was inadequate to meet the rising demands of the population.
[[Image:Mercedesmotorhome.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Classic Mercedes Benz LO 3500 colectivo turned motorhome]]
Mercedes-Benz then took up this novel idea and ran with it, forever shaping the history of the colectivos.  In [[1951]] the then Daimler-Benz AG set up in Argentina its first factories outside [[Germany]]<ref>Mercedez-Benz history [http://www.duttondirect.com/history/view/make:mercedes-benz www.duttondirect.com] accessed [[8 May]] [[2008]]</ref><ref>[http://www.auto-historia.com.ar/Historias/Mercedes%20Historia.htm www.mercedes-benz.argentina/history] accessed [[9 May]] [[2008]] {{Sp icon}}</ref>: one in the town of [[San Martín, Buenos Aires|San Martín]], near Buenos Aires, and another in [[González Catán]]. 

Mercedes released updated local colectivo based on modified L 3500 truck chassis – LO&nbsp;3500, OP&nbsp;3500, LO&nbsp;311, LO&nbsp;312–  with a separately manufactured body fitted at a later stage by different coach builders. In less than a decade the output was 6,500 units a year.  In [[1963]] Mercedes built the 10,000nd colectivo (model LO&nbsp;312), and continued with other models, such as L&nbsp;1112 (120 [[horsepower|HP]]), LA&nbsp;1112 (traction in all wheels) and the L&nbsp;1114. Due to the family relationship with the truck, the Mercedes-Benz Colectivos had a diesel engine with power transmitted to the rear axle by a five-speed constant-mesh gearbox. 

All the lines progressively adopted these units and, between 1950 and 1990, all the colectivos on the street eventually became Mercedes-Benz models, the most successful bus in its day and age. 

===1990 to the present===
'''Omnibus. Blurring of the tradition of the colectivo'''

[[Image:Colectivo.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Modern colectivo Line 114. Urban planners have praised the cities unique and efficient transportation system ]]

In [[1987]] "El Detalle", one of the subsidiaries of Mercedes-Benz, started competing with its parent company, investing in low price and modern urban buses, with cheaper [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] motors. That same year model A-101 was launched. This model was rear-engined and had [[pneumatic]] suspension, allowing for smoother rides and more inside space.   
Mercedes-Benz responded the following year with the rear-engined OH-1314 but that was considered "the death of the Colectivo"<ref>[http://www.busarg.com.ar/evolucion.htm www.busarg.com.ar] {{Sp icon}}</ref>, certainly the end of an era.
  
In [[1989]] the last truck based Colectivos on classic Mercedes-Benz chassis LO-1114 were mounted. Production had been discontinued the previous year.

During the 1990s, some companies found it cheaper to switch to single colored units, and a flurry of mergers and foldings changed the way the colectivos look.
  
Nowadays, only the three-digit numbering survives from the traditional old "líneas", ''[[fileteado]]'' is rare and scarce, the ''filigranas'' were lost, and some of the classic big details, like the panoramic mirrors close to the driver's head, simply disappeared.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:colectivo-045-02-boleto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Modern automatized ''boletos'' (after 1995)]] -->
After 1995 automatic ticket machines added added safety to journeys since the drivers did not have to sell tickets and drive at the same time.

As of [[2005]], Mercedes-Benz units account only for about half of the buses in the city of Buenos Aires and its surroundings, with units built in [[Rosario]] (Eivar, Eiroa-Varela) and in [[Brazil]] (MarcoPolo and others). The other half are El Detalle units.

Most older units have been retired from service in Buenos Aires, as they are considered too dangerous and noisy for use in the fast-paced city. They were disposed of or sent to smaller cities all over the country. Colectivos are usually retired of only when they are too damaged to be repaired, some of them have “resuscitated” as fine motorhomes.

==Description of the ''Colectivo''==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:colectivo-045-01-colectivazo.jpg|thumb|right|213px|Old Van-Bus, ''línea'' 109]] -->
The Mercedes units were more sophisticated than the original ''taxi-bus'' but the body kept its artistic touches, preserving the original style of the ''colectivo''. This style was not influenced by the social class of the districts through which the ''colectivos'' journeyed. All the units of all the ''"líneas"'' shared these characteristics until the 1990s: 
[[Image:Bus Rosario 2.jpg|right|260px|thumb|Latest generation colectivo in the city of Rosario]]
====Multi-colored units====

Decorators used many colorful combinations over the units' external body, helping identify each one of the ''líneas''. These eventually evolved into "corporate colors", meaning that when on occasion two or more lines were bought by the same company, units of different lines were painted in the same colors. Until the 1990s, the ''fileteado'' was kept nonetheless in spirit with the uniqueness of each individual bus.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:colectivo-045-00-monedas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coin container (before automatization, in 1995)]] -->
====''Fileteados''====

''[[Fileteado]]'' was defined as: "art on wheels": full of colored ornaments and symmetries completed with poetic phrases, sayings and aphorisms, both humorous or roguish, emotional or philosophical"<ref>[http://www.martinianoarce.com/#english www.martinianoarce.com]</ref>.
The  colectivos were where this art found its best "canvas". Long, wide mirrors placed around the driver seat often had winding drawings and motifs that usually portrayed the driver's preferences in [[football (soccer)|football]], [[religion]] and [[Tango music|tango]]. 
The outside of the units was also painted with ''fileteado'' details, flower motifs, [[Flag of Argentina|national flags]], and football team flags. It was also very common to see phrases written down in complex fonts, usually in the back. These phrases were often ingenious [[puns]] or rhymes and became part of Argentine folklore. A simple example of a very common phrase is: ''Lo mejor que hizo la vieja es el pibe que maneja'' ("The best thing my old woman did was the lad who's driving").

====Other details====

The units with a larger budget had more details added around the driver's seat. These usually came in the form of lights of exotic colors or seat covers with wool and fringes or even leather. It was very common to see the gear-stick full of hanging [[knickknack]]s and the casing where the tickets and coins were stored covered with motifs.

==In popular culture== 
*The cultural roots of "porteños" (inhabitants of the city Buenos Aires) placed the Colectivo for many years as one of their distinctive icons, together with the ''Obelisco'' in Buenos Aires and the fanaticism for football.  

*The makers of the [[1979 in film|1979]] motion picture ''La fiesta de todos'' <ref>[http://www.cinenacional.com/peliculas/index.php?pelicula=791 www.cinenacional.com] {{Sp icon}}</ref>, after Argentina's victory in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] were forced by the military government to film one of its key stories inside a colectivo.  

*One of Argentina's best-remembered [[soap opera]]s was called ''Un mundo de 20 asientos'' ("A 20-seat world") and its main character was a ''colectivero'' (colectivo driver).

*With the cultural explosion in Argentina from the 1980s, in films and intellectual endeavors, colectivos became one of the best-known examples of mass transport in the [[Western World]], similar to [[London]]'s [[double-decker]] buses or the [[New York City subway]].

* Domestically, the colectivo is also called '''''bondi'''''; the word comes from the name of [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[tram|tramway]]s (''bondes''), in turn from [[English language|English]] ''bonds'', which is how the government paid for the Rio tramway system to the British company that built it.

* Tickets are called '''''boletos'''''. Before [[1995]], they were sold by the ''colectivero'' himself, and consisted of multi-colored strips of paper, with a 5-digit numeration. Palindromic numbers (such as ''10301'', ''29692'', ''12321'') were called ''capicúas'' (from [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''cap i cúa'', "head and tail") and were traditionally conserved by the user as [[luck]]y charms.

*The term colectivo came to be used in some neighbouring countries including [[Paraguay]].

== Usage in Buenos Aires ==
[[Image:Colectivo Linea 107 .jpg|thumb|right|270px|Monochromatic colour schemes like on this line are unusual since there are so many lines that multi-coloured combinations are a must.]]
The colectivo bus operations of Buenos Aires, Argentina, provide a premium-quality bus service that attracts exceptionally high ridership with virtually no public financial support<ref>[http://trb.metapress.com/content/v5542g6mh27j6u44/ Transportation Research Board, Buenos Aires Colectivo Buses and Experience with Privatization] accessed [[5 May]] [[2008]]</ref>, and their frequency makes them equal to the subway systems of other cities, but on wheels, however, they cover a far wider area than the subway system, which is limited to a small (though the most active) part of the city.

With very affordable ticket prices and extensive routes, usually not further than four blocks from folks residences, the colectivo is by far the preferred mode of transportation around the city. "Porteños" have a love-hate relationship with the colectivo. On one side, they tend to be very crowded in [[rush hour]] and are a haven for [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]] and petty [[theft|thieves]]. [[begging|Beggars]] and itinerant salesmen hawk on board. On the other hand, they are a loved necessity in the city and a convenient and cheap way to get around. Most colectivos in big cities of Argentina do not have a fixed timetable, but run from 4 to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day.

===Fares===
Most buses share a basic fare system which is cheap, distance traveled works similar to the [[Honour System]] of Fares. The "universal" fare (in pesos) is:

* [[Argentine Peso|ARS]] 0.90 (Around USD 0.28) for less than 6 kilometers
* [[Argentine Peso|ARS]] 1.00 (Around USD 0.32) for more than 6 kilometers and up to 12. 
* [[Argentine Peso|ARS]] 1.40 (Around USD 0.42) for more than 12 kilometers

These fares are on a per bus basis, there is no transfer scheme across lines, or between the bus and the underground.
