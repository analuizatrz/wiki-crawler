[[Income in the United States|Income]], measured either by [[Household income in the United States|household]] or [[Personal income in the United States|individual]], is perhaps the most commonly used measure for whether or not a given entity may be considered affluent. The term's usage varies greatly depending on context and speaker. Both an [[American middle class#The Professional/Managerial Middle Class|upper middle class]] person with a personal income of $77,500 annually and a billionaire may be referred to as affluent.

The [[American upper class|upper class]] is most commonly defined as the top 1% with household incomes commonly exceeding $250,000 annually. These two figures should be seen only as guidlines based upon the top 1% of a population because net worth exceeding 1 million may be increasingly inaccurate as an [[upper class]] indicator as the value of the dollar falls and inflation along with interest and the turn of the century's [[Housing bubble|real estate boom]] causes more and more people to self-classify as [[millionaires]].

Overall the term affluent may be applied to a variety of individuals, households or other entities depending on context. Data from the US Census Bureau serves as the main guideline for defining affluence. US government data not only reveals the nation's [[Income in the United States|income distribution]] but also provides data regarding the demographic characteristics of those to whom the term, affluent, may be applied.<ref name="US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% household income distribution and demographic characteristics, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/hhinc/new05_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% household income distribution and demographic characteristics, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

==Top percentiles==
Affluence and economic standing within society is often expressed in terms of percentile ranking. Economic ranking is conducted either in terms of giving lower thresholds for a designated group (e.g. the top 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.) or in terms of the percentage of households/individuals with incomes above a certain thresholds (e.g. above $75,000, $100,000, $150,000, etc.). The table below presents 2006 income data in terms of the lower thresholds for the given percentages (e.g. the top 25.6% of households had incomes exceeding $80,000, compared to $47,000 for the top quarter of individuals).<ref name="US Census Bureau, personal income distribution, age 25+, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau, personal income distribution, age 25+, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref><ref name="US Census Bureau, overall household income distribution, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, overall household income distribution, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

While households with just one income earner, most commonly the male, were the norm in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, 42% of all households and the vast majority of married couple households now have two or more income earners. With so many present day households having two income earners, a substantial increase in household income is easy to explain.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

{{cquote|
"The typical middle-class household in the United States is no longer a one-earner family, with one parent in the workforce and one at home full-time. Instead, the majority of families with small children now have both parents rising at dawn to commute to jobs so they can both pull in paychecks... Today the median income for a fully employed male is $41,670 per year (all numbers are inflation-adjusted to 2004 dollars)—nearly $800 less than his counterpart of a generation ago. The only real increase in wages for a family has come from the second paycheck earned by a working mother." - [[Elizabeth Warren]], Harvard Magazine.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

Two income earner households are far more common among the [[Income quintiles|top quintile]] of households than the general population. 2006 US Census Bureau data indicates that over three quarters, 76%, of households in the top quintile, with [[Household income in the United States|annual incomes]] exceeding $91,200, had two or more income earners compared to just 42% among the general population and a small minority in the [[Income quintiles|bottom three quintiles]]. As a result much of the rising [[Income in the United States|income]] inequity between the upper and lower percentiles can be explained through the increasing percentage of households with two or more incomes.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref><ref name="US Census Bureau, income quintilea and Top 5 Percent, 2004">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new05_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, income quintilea and Top 5 Percent, 2004|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref>

The decrease in worker dissatisfaction, however, is not solely a result of the increase in income.

Recent US Census Bureau publications indicate a strong correlation between race and affluence. In the top [[Household income in the United States|household income]] quintile, households with incomes exceeding $91,200, [[White American|Whites]] and [[Asian American]]s were overrepresented, whereas Hispanics and [[African American]]s were underrepresented.

==Social class==
Economic well-being is often associated with high [[Social structure of the United States|societal status]], yet one needs to remember that [[Income in the United States|income and economic compensation]] of any sort are first and foremost the result of scarcity and may only act as an indicator of social class. It is in the interest of society that all open positions are adequately filled with the occupant being enticed to do his or her best.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus
| publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA | id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref> As a result an occupation that requires a scarce skill, the attainment of which is often documented through an [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational degree]], and entrusts its occupant with a high degree of influence will feature high economic compensation. The high income is meant to ensure that individuals obtain the necessary skills (e.g. medical or graduate school) and complete their tasks with the necessary valor.<ref name="Social Class and Stratification">{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Rhonda | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = Social Class and Stratification
| publisher = Rowman & Littlefield | location = Lanham, MD | id = 0-8476-8543-8}}</ref> Differences in income may, however, be found among occupations of similar sociological nature. The median annual earnings of a physican were in excess of $150,000 in May 2004, compared to $95,000 for an attorney.<ref name="US Department of Labor, annual earnings for doctors">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos074.htm#earnings|title=US Department of Labor, annual earnings for doctors|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref><ref name="Bureau of Labor statistics data published by Monster.com, 20 highest paying jobs">{{cite web|url=http://content.salary.monster.com/articles/salary/highestpay/|title=Bureau of Labor statistics data published by Monster.com, 20 highest paying jobs|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref> Both occupations require finely tuned and scarce skill sets and both are essential to the well-being of society. Yet, family doctors outearned attorneys and other [[American middle class#Professional/Managerial middle class|upper middle class]] professionals by a wide margin as their skill-sets are deemed especially scarce. Overall, high status positions tend to be those requiring a scarce skill and are therefore commonly far better compensated than those in the middle of the occupational strata.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus

"...It is essential that the duties of the positions be performed with the diligence that their importance requires. Inevitably, then, a society must have, first, some kind of rewards that it can use as inducements, and, second, some way of distributing these rewards differently according to positions. The rewards and their distribution become part of the social order... If the rights and prequisites of different positions in a society must be unequal, then society must be stratified... Hence every society... must differentiate persons... and must therefore possess a certain amount of institutionalized inequality."- Kingsley Davis & Wilbert E. Moore, ''Some Principles of Stratification'' re-published in ''Social Class and Stratification'' by Rhonda E. Levine in 1998.<ref name="Social Class and Stratification">{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Rhonda | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = Social Class and Stratification

It is important to remember that the above is an [[ideal type]], a simplified model or reality using optimal circumstances. In reality other factors such as discrimination based on race, ethnicity and gender as well as aggressive political lobbying by certain professional organizations also influence personal income. An individual personal live and the thereon based career decisions as well as his or her personal connections (often attained through "networking") witin the nation's economic institutions are also likely to have an effect on income, [[Social structure of the United States|status]] and whether or not an individual may be referred to as affluent.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class
 | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref> In contemporary America it is a combination of all these factors, with scarcity remaining the by far most prominent one, determine a person's economic compensation. Due to higher status professions requiring advanced and thus less commonly found skill sets (including the ability to supervise and work with a considerable autonomy) are better compensated through the means of income, making high status individuals relatively affluent, depending on [[reference group]].<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus
| publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA | id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref>

While the two paragraphs above only describe the relationship between status and personal income, household income is also often used to infer status. As a result, the dual income phenomenon presents yet another problem in equating affluence with high [[Social structure of the United States|societal status]]. As mentioned earlier in the article 42% of households have two or more income earners, 76% of households with [[six figure income]]s have two or more [[income earner]]s.<ref name="US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% household income distribution and demographic characteristics, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/hhinc/new05_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% household income distribution and demographic characteristics, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> Furthermore people are most likely to marry their professional and societal equals. It therefore becomes apparent that the majority of households with [[Income in the United States|incomes]] exceeding the six figure mark are the result of an economic as well as personal union between two economic equals. Today, two nurses, each making $55,000 a year, can easily outearn a single attorney who makes the median of $95,000 annually.<ref name="US Department of Labor, median income of registered nurses">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos083.htm#earnings|title=US Department of Labor, median income of registered nurses|accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref><ref name="Bureau of Labor statistics data published by Monster.com, 20 highest paying jobs">{{cite web|url=http://content.salary.monster.com/articles/salary/highestpay/|title=Bureau of Labor statistics data published by Monster.com, 20 highest paying jobs|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref> Despite household income rising drastically through the union of two economic equals, neither individual has advanced his or her function and position within society. Yet the household (not individual) may have become more affluent, assuming an increase in [[Median income per household member|household members]] does not off-set the dual-income derived gains.

[[Image:Top-1%.png|thumb|350px|The wide income discrepancies within the top 1.5% of households.]]
Today there are approximately 146,000 (0.1%) households with incomes exceeding $1,500,000, while the top 0.01% or 11,000 households had incomes exceeding $5,500,000. The 400 highest tax payers in the nation had gross annual household incomes exceeding $87,000,000. Household incomes for this group have risen more dramatically than for any other. As a result the gap between those who make less than one and half million dollars annually (99.9% of households) and those who make more (0.1%) has been steadily increasing, prompting ''[[The New York Times]]'' to proclaim that the "Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind." Indeed the income disparities within the top 1.5% are quite drastic. While households in the top 1.5% of households had incomes exceeding $250,000, 443% above the national median, their incomes were still 2200% lower than those of the top .01% of houseolds. One can therefore conclude that any household, even those with incomes of $250,000 annually are relatively poor when compared to the top .1%, who in turn are relatively poor compared to the top 0.000267%, the top 400 taxpaying households.<ref name="The New York Times, Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/national/class/HYPER-FINAL.html?ei=5088&en=f1a744d1ce38c79e&ex=1275624000&pagewanted=print|title=The New York Times, Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind|accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref>

"When F. Scott Fitzgerald pronounced that the very rich "are different from you and me", Ernest Hemingway's famously dismissive response was: "Yes, they have more money." Today he might well add: much, much, much more money. The people at the top of America's money pyramid have so prospered in recent years that they have pulled far ahead of the rest of the population, an analysis of tax records and other government data by ''The New York Times'' shows. They have even left behind people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
