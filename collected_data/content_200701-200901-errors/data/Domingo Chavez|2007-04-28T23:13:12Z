'''Domingo Chavez''', better known as '''Ding Chavez''', is a [[fictional character]] created by American author [[Tom Clancy]] and appearing in many of his [[novel]]s and [[video game]]s. Born in [[Los Angeles]],[[California]], date of birth [[January 12th]] 1968. First recruited to be a member of a secret [[CIA]]-ran anti-drug operation in Colombia in ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'', while he was still in the U.S. Army. He first met [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]] during this novel and has worked with him since. He is married to John Clark's daughter, Patricia, with whom they have a child, John Conor Chavez. He, along with Clark, rescued a [[Japan]]ese [[politics|politician]] who was former prime minister (and later re-elected) in ''[[Debt of Honor]]''. Soon after the events in the Japanese conflict, Domingo worked again with John Clark in implementing Blue Light (recruitment of law enforcement officers as intelligence officers) during Executive Orders. Clark and Chavez lead multiple operations for President Ryan in this episode. He later was recruited into and ultimately became team leader in the multinational counterterrorist organization [[Rainbow Six (computer game)#Team Rainbow|RAINBOW]] in ''[[Rainbow Six (novel)|Rainbow Six]]'', which defeated several terrorist groups and prevented a [[bioterrorism]] plague. It is worthy to note that he later became "Rainbow Six" himself in the later [[Rainbow Six]] video games such as [[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas]]. The position was formerly held by his father-in-law, John Clark.


Ding formerly was part of the 1st Battalion of the 17th Infantry Regiment, with the [[motto]], "Ninja! We own the night." In ''Clear and Present Danger'', he carries ninja throwing stars (as a lucky charm). Before his operation in Colombia he says "We (ninjas) own the night", before he "kills" an "enemy" jungle warfare instructor.

Domingo is known to posess at least 3 intelligence stars; one issued at the beggining of Debt of Honor after a successful operation in Africa, of one was issued for John Clark and Domingo during the Japanese conflict (see Debt of Honor for the conflict; notice of issue in Executive Orders) as well as one for his ongoing operations carried out in Executive Orders (purveyed during Rainbow Six as Golovko reviews his file 'thought to possess no less than 2 Intelligence Stars')
