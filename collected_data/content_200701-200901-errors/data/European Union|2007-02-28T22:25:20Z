==History==
{{main|History of the European Union}}
[[Image:RobetSchuman.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Robert Schuman]]]]
The EU has evolved from a western European trade body into the supranational and intergovernmental body that it is today. After the [[Second World War]], an impetus grew in western Europe for institutional forms of cooperation between states, driven by the determination to rebuild Europe and eliminate the possibility of another [[World War]]. Eastern Europe, on the other hand, was largely within the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[sphere of influence]], and only in the 1990s did the EU see central and eastern European states as potential members.

In [[1946]] [[Winston Churchill]] called for a "United States of Europe" (though without the inclusion of the UK).<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=65 Winston Churchill], www.winstonchurchill.org .Accessed January 25, 2007</ref>  On [[May 9]] [[1950]], the French foreign minister [[Robert Schuman]] presented a proposal for the joint management of France's and West Germany's coal and steel industries. The proposal, known as the "[[Schuman Declaration]]", envisaged the scheme as "the first concrete step towards a European federation".<ref>[http://europa.eu.int/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm]</ref>  It is considered to be the beginning of the creation of what is now the European Union, and led to the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] by [[Germany|(West) Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[Benelux]] countries. This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed in 1951.<ref>[http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm History of the European Union], Europa. Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> [[Image:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The founding nations signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957]]

The first full [[customs union]] - the ''European Economic Community'' (the Common Market) - was established by the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 and implemented on [[1 January]] [[1958]]. This later changed to the ''European Community'', which is now the "first pillar" of the European Union created by the [[Maastricht treaty]].  

On [[29 October]] [[2004]], EU member state heads of government and state [[signature|signed]] the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]]. This was later ratified by 17 member states. However, in most cases ratification was based on parliamentary action, rather than popular vote, and the process faltered on [[29 May]] [[2005]] when French voters rejected the constitution 55% to 45%. [[French referendum on the European Constitution|The French rejection]] was followed three days later by a [[Dutch referendum on the European Constitution|Dutch]] one, in which 62% of voters refused the constitution as well.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the European Union|Geography of Europe}}
[[Image:Beachthehague.JPG|thumb|200px|right|22 member countries are influenced by extensive coastlines and oceanic climate ([[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]])]]
The territory of the European Union is formed by the territory of its member states, and expands with the accession of new members. It covers an area of 4,422,773 [[square kilometre]]s (1,707,642&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]).<ref name=Area.and.population.figure>Figure including the four [[overseas department|French overseas departments]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]]) which are an integral part of the European Union, but excluding the [[Overseas collectivity|French overseas collectivities]] and [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]], which are not part of the European Union.</ref> Extending northeast to Finland, northwest to Ireland and southeast from Cyprus to Portugal in the southwest it represents the [[List of countries by area|seventh largest territory in the world by area]].  It is estimated that the coastline of the European Union is over 150,000km long.

The EU is not coterminous with Europe : significant parts of the continent (e.g. [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], European [[Russia]]) are outside of the EU. The member states of the EU have [[countries bordering the European Union|land borders]] with 21 other nations. Several overseas territories and dependencies of various member states are also formally part of the EU (e.g. the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] or the [[Canary Islands]]) while in other cases territories associated with member states are not part of the EU (e.g. [[Greenland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], most territories associated to the United Kingdom, [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] or [[New Caledonia]]).

Including overseas territories of member states, the EU includes most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] to [[Tropical climate|tropical]]. Meteorological averages for the EU as a whole are therefore not meaningful. The majority of the population live in areas with a [[Mediterranean climate]] (southern Europe), a temperate [[maritime climate]] (western Europe), or a [[Hemiboreal|Warm Summer Continental or Hemiboreal]] climate (in eastern member states).

The EU describes itself as "a family of democratic European countries".<ref name="panorama" /> 
On [[23 July]] [[1952]], six founding members formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), which was transformed into the [[European Community]], later renamed to European Union, in waves of accession:

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the European Union}}
Supporters of the European Union argue that the growth of the EU is a force for [[peace]] and [[democracy]], and that it did prevent wars among members. However, the [[Democratic peace theory|causal factors of war and peace]] are a controversial theoretical issue. Others contend that peace in Europe since [[World War II]] is the product of other causes, such as the moderating influence of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] within their respective power [[bloc]]s, and the mutual external threat for the other bloc/alliance, the need for reconstruction after World War II, and a collective temporary tiring of waging war, and that the dictatorships cited came to an end for entirely different reasons.

The nature and future direction of the European Union itself is the central issue in pan-European politics, and a significant issue in the national politics of the member states. General issues include the ultimate size of the Union, limits on new accession, the pace of new accessions, expansion in membership versus internal integration, a future as a [[political union]] versus a future as a [[free trade zone]], the geographical limits of "Europe" for membership purposes, and the values and historical-cultural identity of the Union. Internal structure, procedures and policies are themselves subject to constant political debate. Specific issues at present include the status and future of the [[European Constitution|constitutional treaty]]; [[enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] on the [[Balkans]] and [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkish accession]]; problems of financial probity and [[democratic deficit|democratic accountability]]; relative economic viability; revision of the rules of the [[Stability and Growth Pact]]; and the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].

Subsequently, it was [[ratified]] by 15 member states, and rejected in [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|French]] and [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|Dutch]] referenda.]]
The [[Financial Perspective]] for 2007–2013 was defined in 2005 when EU members agreed to fix the common budget to 1.045% of the [[European]] [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/misc/87677.pdf Financial Perspective 2007–2013]}}, Council of the European Union, [[17 December]] [[2005]]. Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] agreed to review the [[UK rebate|British rebate]], negotiated by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1984. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] declared this increase in the budget will permit Europe to "finance common policies" such as the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] or the [[Sixth Framework Programme|Research and Technological Development Policy]]. France's demand to lower the [[value added tax|VAT]] in catering was refused.<ref>"[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/30/business/vat.php Poles block EU deal on lower VAT]", ''[[The Times|Times Online]]'', [[31 January]] [[2006]].

The [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE), commonly referred to as the European Constitution, is an international [[treaty]] intended to create a [[constitution]] for the European Union. The constitution was rejected by France and the Netherlands, where referenda were held<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4601731.stm Varied reasons behind Dutch 'No']", [[BBC News Online]], [[1 June]] [[2005]].

==Three pillars==
{{main|Three pillars of the European Union}}
The 'pillar' structure created by the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] moved the older policies and activities into the 'first pillar, labeled the 'European Communities'. The more controversial new policy areas - foreign policy, security and defence, asylum and immigration, and judicial co-operation - were moved into two new 'pillars'.
===European Economic Community===
{{main|European Community}}
[[Image:Euro_banknotes.png|thumb|200px|right|The [[Euro]] is adopted by 13 countries]]
The most prominent policy goal of the European Union is the development and maintenance of an effective [[single market]]. Significant efforts have been made to create harmonised standards designed to bring economic benefits through creating larger, more efficient markets. Since the Treaty of Rome, policies have implemented [[free trade]] of goods and services among member states, and continue to do so. This policy goal was further extended to three of the four [[EFTA]] states by the [[European Economic Area]], EEA. Common [[EU competition law]] restricts anti-competitive activities of companies (through antitrust law and merger control) and member states (through the State Aids regime). The EU promotes free movement of [[financial capital|capital]] between member states (and other EEA states). The members have a common system of indirect [[taxation]], the [[VAT]], as well as common customs duties and excises on various products. They have a common external [[customs (tax)|customs]] tariff, and a common position in international trade negotiations.  Other single-market policies include energy market policy and the [[European Common Aviation Area]]. The introduction of the [[Euro]], not yet adopted by all member states, created the [[Eurozone]], a single currency area including 13 member states with more than 300 million people.

A second major goal has been the ''free movement of persons.'' Citizens of older member states can live and work anywhere within the EU with their spouses and children, provided they can support themselves. Citizens of other EEA states and Switzerland, have comparable freedom, but [[work permit]]s for citizens of some new member states are restricted (in the older member states). The unforeseen scale of migrant labour, especially from Poland, has become a contentious political issue in those states, and the spectre of the [[Polish plumber]] played a role in the campaign against the EU Constitutional Treaty in France. <ref>''Polish plumbers and the EU constitution'' [politics.guardian.co.uk/eu/story/0,9061,1495098,00.html]</ref>

In terms of funding, the two major policies are the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (with the [[Common Fisheries Policy]]) and the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|structural and cohesion funds]], which improve infrastructure and assist disadvantaged regions. Together they are known as the ''cohesion policies.'' The EU also has funds for emergency financial aid, for instance after natural disasters. The funding extends to programmes in candidate countries and other [[Eastern Europe]]an countries, as well as aid to many developing countries, through programmes such as [[Phare]], [[TACIS]], [[Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession|ISPA]]. The EU also funds research and technological development, through four-year [[Seventh Framework Programme|Framework Programmes]] for Research and Technological Development.

In a more political sense, the EU attempts to create - with much controversy - a sense of European citizenship and European political life. That includes freedom for citizens of the EU to vote and to stand as candidates in local government and [[European Parliament]] elections in any member state.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/youreurope/nav/en/citizens/citizenship/citizenship/index.html European citizenship], Europa. Accessed January 24, 2007</ref> The [[European Parliament]] is now attempting to create pan-European political parties, and almost all members have joined at least a federation of national political parties.

===Common Foreign & Security Policy===
{{Main|Common Foreign and Security Policy|European Security and Defence Policy}}
[[Image:Condisolana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Javier Solana]], the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative for the CFSP]] (l.) and [[Condoleezza Rice]]]]
Defence and security are traditionally matters of national sovereignty. 
EU policies in this area were established as the second of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] in the [[Maastricht treaty]] of 1992. The ''Common Foreign and Security Policy'' or CFSP were further defined and broadened in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of 1997. It superseded the [[European Political Cooperation]]. The CFSP acknowledges [[NATO]] being responsible for territorial defence of Europe and "peace-making". In 1999 the [[European Council]] took over responsibilities for the implementation  of peace-keeping missions ([[EUFOR]] in Bosnia Herzegovina, Congo) and policing of treaties.  The supervision is coordinated by the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]], [[Javier Solana]].

The [[European Security and Defence Policy]] is an element of the  CFSP and stipulated the framing for policies that could deal with humanitarian and rescue tasks, and tasks of combat forces. It includes the creation of a 60,000-member [[European Rapid Reaction Force]] for [[peacekeeping]] purposes, an EU [[military]] staff, a [[European Defence Agency]] and an EU [[satellite]] centre (for intelligence purposes).

===Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters===
{{Main|Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters}}
The third of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] of the European Union is focusing on cooperation in criminal matters, including sharing of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] (through [[Europol]] and the [[Schengen Information System]]), agreement on common definition of [[crime|criminal offences]] and expedited [[extradition]] procedures.
It is the EU instrument of [[law]] enforcement and combating [[racism]]. 

It was created as the ''Justice and Home Affairs'' pillar in the [[Treaty of Maastricht]]; subsequently the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] transferred the areas of illegal [[immigration]], [[visa (document)|visas]], [[refugee|asylum]], and judicial co-operation to the integrated first ([[European Community]]) pillar.   The term ''Justice and Home Affairs'' now covers these integrated fields as well as the intergovernmental third pillar.

==Institutions and bodies==
[[Image:José Manuel Durão Barroso.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The [[President of the European Commission]], [[José Manuel Barroso]]]]
{{Main|Location of European Union institutions}}

The EU has no official capital and its institutions are divided between several cities:

* [[Brussels]] — seat of the [[European Commission]] (staff of about 23,000) and the [[Council of Ministers]]. It is also the venue of the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] (785 members) committee meetings and mini-sessions and (since 2004) the host city for all [[European Council]] summits.
* [[Strasbourg]] — seat of the [[European Parliament]] and venue of its twelve week-long plenary sessions each year. Strasbourg is also the seat of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which are not bodies of the EU.
* [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] — seat of the [[European Court of Justice]] (incorporating the [[Court of First Instance]]), the [[European Court of Auditors]], the [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]] and the [[European Investment Bank]].
* [[Frankfurt]] — seat of the [[European Central Bank]] (Composing the [[European System of Central Banks]])
[[Image:Angela Merkel Joh.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]] of the [[European Council]] is currently held by Germany ([[Angela Merkel]], Chancellor)]]
* The [[European Council]], which is a regular meeting of the 27 head of member states and the [[European Commission president]] is sometimes also listed as an institution, although since it lacks its own staff, budget and the legal powers held by the above 5 institutions, it is better described as a "quasi-institution".

There are also two [[Advisory bodies to the European Union|advisory committees]] to the institutions; [[Committee of the Regions]], advising on regional issues and the [[Economic and Social Committee]], advising on economic and social policy (principally relations between workers and employers).

A number (currently 32) of more specialised [[agencies of the European Union]], usually set up by [[secondary legislation]], which exist to implement particular policies. Examples are the [[Europol]] (the European Police Office), the [[European Environment Agency]], the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] or the [[Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market]], the [[Political and Security Committee]], established in the context of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], monitoring and advising on international issues of global security.

==Law==
{{main|European Union law}}
{{see also|EU treaties|Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Citizenship of the European Union}}
European Union law is the first and only example of a [[supranationalism|supranational]] legal framework. According to the [[European Court of Justice]], in one of its earliest cases, it constitutes "a new legal order of international law".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML Van Gend en Loos v. Nederlanse Administratie Der Belastingen], EU-LEX, Accessed January 25, 2007</ref> Sovereign [[nation states]], by becoming EU members, pool their authority for the mutual social and economic benefit of their peoples. The principle of [[subsidiarity]] means that laws are passed at the regional level where they are more effective when member states take action by themselves, while EU law is supreme in its own fields.
[[Image:EUCoJ.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[European Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]]]
The two main treaties which form the basis of EU law are the Treaty of the European Community, or the [[Treaty of Rome]] from 1957, and the Treaty of the European Union, or the [[Maastricht treaty]] of 1992. The Treaty of Rome is the so called 'first pillar' of the EU. The "European Community" refers to the competence of the EU to act in the social and economic arena. The Maastricht treaty formed the new European Union, and added two further "pillars". These are a common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs. In both these fields a consensus among member states is needed to act. 

EU law covers a range as broad as many member states themselves.<ref>see Article 3 TEU for a list</ref> Where a conflict arises between EU law and the law of a member state, EU law takes precedence, so that the law of a member state must be disapplied.<ref>in general, see C 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v. ENEL'' [1964] ECR 585, 593; in the U.K. see, [[Factortame case|''Factortame Ltd. v Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603'']]; in Germany see ''Solange II'' (''Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft'', BVerfG decision of 22 Oct. 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265); in Italy see ''Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; in France see, Raoul George Nicolo [1990] 1 CMLR 173</ref> Both the provisions of the Treaties, and EU regulations are said to have "[[direct effect]]" horizontally. This means private citizens can rely on the rights granted to them (and the duties created for them) against one another. For instance, an air hostess may sue her aeroplane company employer for sexual discrimination.<ref>under Art. 141 TEC, C-43/75 ''Defrenne v. Sabena'' [1976] ECR 455</ref> The other main legal instrument of the EU, "directives", have direct effect, but only "vertically". Private citizens may not sue one another on the basis of an EU directive, since these are meant to be addressed to the member state. Directives allow some choice for member states in the way they translate a directive into an [[act of Parliament]], or [[statutory instrument]]. Once this has happened citizens may rely on the law that has been implemented. They may only sue the government "vertically" for failing to implement a directive correctly. An example of a directive is the [[Product liability]] Directive,<ref>85/374/EEC</ref> which makes companies liable for dangerous and defective products that harm consumers.

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of the European Union}}
[[Image:G8 2006 leaders 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The European Commission has non-voting representation  at [[G8]] summits.]]

In more recent times, the European Union has been extending its influence to the east. It has accepted several new members that were previously behind the [[Iron Curtain]]. It is hoped that in a similar fashion to the entry of Spain, Portugal and Greece in the [[1980s]], membership for these states will help cement economic and political stability.

The [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] states of [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] are members of the [[European Economic Area]] which allows them to participate in most aspects of the EU single market without acceding to the EU. [[Switzerland]], the fourth EFTA state, rejected EEA membership in a referendum; however, it has established close ties to the EU by means of various bilateral treaties.
[[Image:Peter Mandelson.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Peter Mandelson]], [[European Commissioner for Trade|Commissioner of Trade]], represents the EU in the [[WTO]]]]
The European Union also represents its 27 member states in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) through its Trade Commissioner [[Peter Mandelson]]. The latest [[Doha round|WTO negotiation round]] has currently stalled, in part due to the EU's refusal to curtail the agricultural subsidies it distributes through the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] without similar action by other developed countries.

The European Union's influential econonomic status and its nation-like characteristics has been acknowledged by the United States' [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in their publication, ''The World Factbook''.

==Enlargement==
{{main|Enlargement of the European Union|European Union membership criteria}} 
[[Image:EUenl.gif|thumb|right|200px|EU enlargement 1952–2007]]
Since starting with the six states of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in [[1952]], there are now 27 [[European Union member states|member states]] in the EU. There have been six enlargements, with the largest occurring on [[May 1]], [[2004]], when 10 states joined, and the most recent on [[January 1]], [[2007]], when [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] joined. In order to join the European Union, a state needs to fulfill the economic and political conditions generally known as the [[Copenhagen criteria]] (after the [[Copenhagen]] summit in June [[1993]]). That basically requires a secular, democratic government, rule of law and corresponding freedoms and institutions. According to the [[Treaty on European Union|EU Treaty]], each current member state and also the [[European Parliament]] have to agree to any enlargement.

'''[[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey is an official candidate]]''' to join the European Union; Turkish European ambitions date back to 1962 Ankara Agreements. Turkey started preliminary negotiations on [[3 October]] [[2005]]. However, analysts believe [[2015]] is the earliest date the country can join the union because of the large number of economic and social reforms it has to complete, and because the [[2007]]–[[2013|13]] budget takes no account of the considerable costs Turkey's accession will involve.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4107919.stm Q&A: Turkey's EU entry talks]", [[BBC News Online]], [[4 October]] [[2005]].

However, the [[Copenhagen criteria#Geographic criteria|Copenhagen criteria]] do not impose strict geographic conditions. There are also worries about [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s view about the "European Identity", as in a cultural, continent-based Christianity, historically opposed by the Ottoman Empire, especially since he was designated as Pope.<ref>Magister, Sandro"[http://www.chiesa.espressonline.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=19629&eng=y Europe is Christian, but Turkey's Crescent Moon Shines in its Skies]", Chiesa Espress, [[15 October]] [[2004]].</ref>However, he expressed greater support for Turkey's admission following his late-November visit to the country in 2006.

'''[[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatia is an official candidate]]''' country to join and started accession negotiations in October 2005. In June 2006, the EU officials projected that the accession of Croatia would likely happen in 2009. The closure of negotiations for all chapters of the ''[[acquis communautaire]]'' is expected towards the end of 2008, with the signing of the Accession treaty and membership happening either in January or May 2009.

'''[[Accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the European Union|The Republic of Macedonia]]''' is the latest country to be given official candidate status, [[as of 2005|as of December 2005]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://ec.europa.eu/comm/enlargement/report_2005/pdf/package_v/com_562_final_en_opinion_fyrom.pdf  EU application assessment of Macedonia]}}, Europa-Enlargement.

[[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]] are officially recognised as potential candidates. In [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]], however, application for membership was rejected by referendum. [[Iceland]] is also often touted as potential applicant but is opposed to the EU's [[Common Fisheries Policy]].

{{main|Economy of the European Union}}

Considered as a single entity, the European Union has the largest economy in the world, with a GDP of 13.4 trillion USD (2005) using Purchasing power parity (PPP). The EU economy has grown at around 2% per annum so far this century. In 2006, it is estimated 3.5 million jobs were created in the Eurozone. [[Germany]], the largest economy in the EU, grew 2.7% in 2006 and is expected to grow at around 2% in 2007. The EU's rate of growth is expected to increase — growth for 2007 is expected to be at 2.7% — especially as new member states are poorer than the EU average, and have the capacity to grow at a higher rate.

The European Union is characterised by great regional economic disparities, reflecting the different historical backgrounds of its member states. Even corrected for purchasing power, there is a 12-fold differential between the richest region [[Inner London]] and the poorest, [[Nord-Est (development region)|Romania Nord-Est]]. <ref>[[Eurostat]] News release 23/2007,19 February 2007. ''Regional GDP per inhabitant in the EU27. GDP per inhabitant in 2004 ranged from 24% of the EU27 average in Nord-Est in Romania to 303% in Inner London.''</ref> Commuter effects distort GDP figures for urban areas with large commuting flows, but at a scale where this does not apply (e.g. Ostösterreich compared to Romania Nord-Est) there is still a 5-to-1 differential between typical western European levels and the poorest parts of the new member states.

Differences between member states are also significant. GDP per capita is typically 10% to 25% above EU average in the older western member states, but only one-third to one-half in most eastern member states, and in possible accession candidates such as Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey. For comparison, United States GDP per capita  is 50% above EU average: Japanese GDP per capita is comparable to western European levels at 10% above EU average.. <ref>[[Eurostat]] News release166/2006,18 December 2006. ''GDP per capita in purchasing power standards. GDP per capita in the Member States ranged from 48% to 251% of the EU25 average in 2005.''</ref>

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of the European Union}}
The population of the European Union is that of its [[Member states of the European Union|member states]], and changes with each accession (or, more rarely, secession). Each change in membership also affects demographic averages such as [[life expectancy]] and [[fertility rate]]. The total population of all member countries is approximately 494 million inhabitants [[as of 2007|as of January 2007]].<ref name=Area.and.population.figure>Figure including the four [[overseas department|French overseas departments]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]]) which are an integral part of the European Union, but excluding the [[Overseas collectivity|French overseas collectivities]] and [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]], which are not part of the European Union.</ref> Expected short-term accessions (Croatia) will not substantially increase this figure. Growth in the short term is expected to come from net migration, since deaths will probably outnumber births from around [[2010]]. After [[2025]], this negative [[natural increase]] will probably exceed net immigration, and (discounting new accessions) population is expected to decline gradually.<ref name="EU25populationprojection">{{PDFlink|[http://intranet.icea.es/pensiones/documentacion/Proy_demog_2004_2050.pdf EU25 population projection]}}, Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

===Largest cities===
{{main|Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|Largest urban areas of the European Union|Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union}}
The European Union is home to more [[Global_city|global cities]] than any other region in the world. Over 16 cities with populations over one million inhabitants, counted in its city proper. 
However, different countries deal differently with large cities. The Greek city [[Athens]], for example, has  about 3 million inhabitants, however it has been divided into many municipalities making the city proper of Athens one of the smaller European capitals with about 800.000 inhabitants.
Densely populated regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cites and are now encompassing large metropolitan areas are [[Rhine-Ruhr]] having approximately 10.5 million inhabitants ([[Cologne]], [[Dortmund]],[[Düsseldorf]] et al.), [[Randstad]] approx. 7 million ([[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] et al.), [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Area]] approx. 4 million ([[Frankfurt]], [[Wiesbaden]] et al.) and the [[Upper Silesian Industry Area]] approx. 3.5 million.

===Religion===
{{further|[[Religion in Europe]]}}
The significant religious diversity to be found amongst the populations of EU members reflects their diverse history and culture, and the wider European culture of which they are a part. A nominal majority professes [[Christianity]], predominantly [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Despite this, not all populations have Christian majorities. In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Estonia]], for example, a majority has no religious affiliation.

The recent influx of immigrants to the affluent EU nations has brought in various religions of their native homelands, including [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Baha'i faith|the Baha'i faith]] and [[Sikhism]]. [[Judaism]] has had a long history in Europe and has coexisted with the native populations for centuries, despite centuries of discrimination against Jewish people and several attendant periods of persecution or genocide by European rulers. As the Christian churches have historically wielded much power in Europe, reaction to this has allowed [[secularism]] to plant deep roots on European soil which has contributed to the rise in [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]].

The EU is a secular institution, and God was not mentioned in its proposed constitution, despite pressure from the churches.  Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised the Pope that she will use Germany's EU presidency to try to include a reference to Christianity and God in a revived constitution.  However, this has provoked opposition, not the least in the German press.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5337166.stm</ref>

==Education and science==
[[Image:GalileoPS.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Galileo positioning system]] has been initiated by the EU and [[European Space Agency|ESA]]]]
{{main|Education in the European Union}}
The [[European Commission]] initiated the [[ERASMUS programme]] for [[higher education]].
It was established in 1987 and forms a major part of the EU [[Socrates programme|Socrates II programme]]. Its name is an abbreviation of "European Region Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students" and has been inspired by the life of [[Desiderius Erasmus]]. It was incorporated into the [[Socrates programme]] when that programme was established in 1995. The Socrates programme ended in 1999 and was replaced with the Socrates II programme in 2000. Other educational programmes include Leonardo (secondary schools), Grundtvig (adult learning) and Arion (teaching decision-makers).

The aim of ERASMUS is to encourage and support [[academic mobility]] of [[higher education]] students and teachers within the European Union, the [[European Economic Area]] countries of [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] as well as the candidate country [[Turkey]]. 2,199 [[higher education]] institutions are participating in ERASMUS across the 31 countries involved in the [[Socrates programme]]. 1.4 million students have already taken part.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Table 8: Actual Number of ERASMUS Students by Country of Home institution 1987/88-2004/05 | url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/socrates/erasmus/statisti/table8.pdf|format=PDF}} Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>
[[Image:1Ariane5LaunchArianespace.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The [[Ariane 5]] is an [[expendable launch system]]]]

Member states of the EU are, along with other European nations and several international NGOs, signatories to  the [[Bologna process]].  This is an attempt to create a [[European higher education area]], by making [[academic degree]] standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout [[Europe]]. It is named after the place it was proposed, the [[University of Bologna]] with the signing, in [[1999]], of the [[Bologna declaration]] by ministers of education from 29 European countries in the Italian city of [[Bologna]]. Governmental meetings have been held in [[Prague]] ([[2001]]), [[Berlin]] ([[2003]]) and [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] ([[2005]]); the next meeting will take place in [[London]] in Spring 2007.

The [[Galileo positioning system]] (or simply 'Galileo'), is a proposed [[Global Navigation Satellite System]], to be built by the European Union and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).
The current project plan has the system as operational by 2010. Several other nations are joining the
project co financing the development such as China, Israel, India, Marocco or South Korea. ESA is a non-EU organisation and its membership includes non-EU countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Norway]]. Both countries ''are'', however, within the [[EFTA]]. There are ties between those organisations, with various agreements in place and being worked on, to establish the legal status of ESA with regard to the EU.<ref>ESA information on its relationship to the EU. [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFEPYV1SD_index_0.html]</ref> There are common goals between ESA and the EU, and ESA has an EU liaison office in Brussels.

==Culture and identity==
Supporters of [[European integration]] often appeal to a European historical narrative, typically including [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], the [[feudalism]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], 19th century [[Liberalism]] and (sometimes) negative elements such as the [[World Wars]]. This history is assumed to be the source of European values. The status of [[Christianity]] as 'European heritage' is controversial, and has consequences for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]]. The [[European Convention]] rejected inclusion of a reference in the proposed [[European Constitution]] to Christianity and/or God. The text finally adopted in the [[wikisource:Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: Preamble|Preamble]] reads:
[[Image:Sibiuphoto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Two cities are the [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2007 ([[Sibiu]])]]
:''DRAWING INSPIRATION from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, from which have developed the universal values of the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law,...''

Attitudes and values of the EU population are very diverse, influenced by [[social class]], religion, level of education, and [[ethnicity]], and they are not necessarily either European or national in character. The interests of member [[state]]s are mainly economic and political in nature.

There is no single culture or lifestyle common to the entire EU population. Some are local, national or regional. There are aspects of popular culture which can be found all over the EU, such as [[Football (soccer)|football]], but none are limited to the EU (they may be equally influential in non-member states in Europe, and some are global).

===Cultural policies===

{{main|Cultural policies of the European Union}}
[[Image:Luxembourg0080.JPG|thumb|right|200px| The cultural capitals are designated by the EU for a period of one year ([[Luxembourg]])]]
The member states have been traditionally reluctant to lose control of cultural policy, given the central role of culture in [[national identity]]. Cultural cooperation  ''between'' member states has become a community competency since its inclusion in [[1992]] in the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Actions taken in the cultural area by the European Union include the [[Culture 2000]] 7-year programme, the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme, the [[European Cultural Month]] event, the [[Media Plus]] programme, experimental actions and the awarding of various grants.

The European Union gave grants to 233 cultural projects in 2004 and launched a webportal dedicated to Europe and Culture, responding to the [[European Council]]'s expressed desire to see the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by the most advanced technological means."

===Sport===
{{main|Sport policies of the European Union}}
[[Image:Campnoumatch.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular sport in Europe ([[:en:Camp Nou|Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]])]]
Sport, including [[spectator sports]], is popular in the EU-countries: most popular is [[Football (soccer)|football]]. [[Cycling]], [[tennis]], and [[field hockey]] are also sports widely watched and played in the EU countries. Other sports are favourites in fewer countries, such as [[ice hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[handball]], and [[motorsports]]; and several sports are unique to one or a few countries (e.g. [[cricket]]-UK, [[korfball]]-Netherlands and Belgium). 

Although it recently launched an anti-doping convention, the European Union plays a minor and mostly indirect role in sport policy. Sport is normally considered to be outside the [[principle of conferral|competences conferred]] by the member states to the European Union. Sport is also organized nationally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally. The European Union does not have specific sport policies. The role of the EU could increase, if (for example) the [[European Constitution]] were to be ratified.

Other policies of the EU can have an impact on sports though, as famously exemplified by the [[Bosman ruling]], which, among other things, prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players from other EU states. This ruling subsequently forced [[UEFA]] to modify the rules for all its European members. The Bosman ruling also gave all EU players the right of [[free transfer]] after expiration of their contracts.

===Languages===

German is the most widely spoken mother tongue followed by English, French, and Italian. English is by far the most spoken foreign language, to the extent that it is arguably in the process of establishing itself as the unofficial lingua franca of the Union. French and German follow next. 56% of EU citizens are able to hold a conversation in one language apart from their mother tongue.<ref>European Commission, {{PDFlink|[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages]}}, ''European Commission website'' (published online only).

The EU provides [[Directorate-General for Interpretation (European Commission)|interpretation]], [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|translation]] and [[Publications Office (European Union)|publication services]] in its official languages, but only legislation and important documents are produced in all 23 official languages; other documents are translated only into the languages needed. For internal purposes the EU institutions make their own language arrangements. The European Commission, for example, conducts its internal business in English, French and German, and goes fully multilingual only for public information and communication purposes. The European Parliament, on the other hand, has members who need working documents in their own languages, so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset.<ref>[http://europa.eu/languages/en/document/59#5 Europa:Languages and Europe.

A wide variety of languages from other parts of the world are spoken by [[immigrant]] communities in EU countries. [[Maghreb Arabic]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi]] and [[Balkan languages]] are spoken in many parts of the EU. Many older immigrant communities are [[bilingual]] in the local language and in that of their community. Migrant languages are not given formal status or recognition in the EU or in the EU countries and they are not covered by EU language-teaching programmes.<ref name="Many tongues, one family"/>

==Infrastructure and environment==

[[Image:DanishWindTurbines.jpg|thumb|right|290px|The  EU is one of the leading regions in [[Research and development|R & D]] of [[renewable energy]] (Offshore wind farm near [[Copenhagen]])]]
The EU has a policy to improve cross-border infrastructure, see [[Trans-European Networks]].

The European Union has legislated in the area of energy policy for many years, and evolved out of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The concept of introducing a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] on October 27, [[2005]] in [[London]].

The EU currently imports 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]], making it the world's leading importer of these fuels.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/ 'Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe], www.msnbc.msn.com . Accessed January 24, 2007</ref>

The EU has enacted a series of directives concerning wastewater treatment, drinking water and water resources management that have a profound impact on water and sanitation infrastructure investments in EU member countries (see [[EU water policy]]). In particular the wastewater directive is considered by the European Commission the most cost intensive European legislation in the environmental sector.
