The whole range of "notable" Simpsons actors and characters are expected to be used.<ref name="usa" /> Along with the regular series cast, frequent guest stars [[Albert Brooks]], [[Kelsey Grammer]] ([[Sideshow Bob]])<ref name="iesb">[http://www.iesb.net/fox2006/051206d.php Interview: Kelsey Grammer On the Beast PLUS Sideshow Bob Is In The Simpsons Movie!] at IESB.net, May 12, 2006</ref>, and [[Joe Mantegna]] ([[Fat Tony]]) will be in the film, as will [[Minnie Driver]] and activist [[Erin Brockovich]]. 

The film's producers expect that the film will be [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rated PG-13]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], as it will contain stronger language and subject matter than that of the TV series.<ref name="usa">{{cite news|url=http://usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-04-02-simpsons-movie_x.htm |title=Mmmm, popcorn: A 'Simpsons' film in '07 |accessdate=2006-04-02 |first=Scott |last=Bowles |date=[[2006-04-02]] |publisher=[[USA Today]]}}</ref>

==Previews==
===Teaser trailer===
[[Image:Simpsons teaser trailer.png|left|thumb|240px|Homer sitting on his couch in the teaser trailer that debuted on March 31, 2006]]

A [[teaser trailer]] for the film<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/thesimpsonsmovie/| title=Apple - Trailers - The Simpsons Movie - Teaser |publisher=Apple Computer}}</ref> was attached to the Fox movie, ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' and could be seen in most theaters in the [[United States|U.S.]] starting on [[March 31]], [[2006]]; this same trailer (cropped for television) was broadcast during the [[April 2]] episode of ''The Simpsons'', [[Million Dollar Abie]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002275630 |title='Simpsons' movie revealed in trailer |accessdate=2006-04-01 |first=Sheigh |last=Crabtree |date=[[2006-04-01]] |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

The teaser begins with the camera [[Panning (camera)|panning]] closely over the [[Superman]] "S" insignia, while a [[voice-over]] actor dramatically announces "In 2007, leaping his way onto the silver screen, the greatest hero in American history." This is meant to give the impression of the trailer being for ''[[Superman Returns]]'', one of the high-profile releases of the summer of 2006. 

The shot then zooms out to show [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], wearing only a tiny [[Superman]] T-Shirt and [[briefs]],  sitting on his couch. He blinks and timidly states, "I forgot what I'm supposed to say!"

The words "The Simpsons" appear, followed a moment later by the word "Movie" in large letters, as simultaneously the announcer says "''The Simpsons Movie'' Opening worldwide, [[July 27]], [[2007 in film|2007]]." Homer is heard in the background, saying "Uh oh, we'd better get started!" It then displays the release date, while [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] says "excellent" in the background.

The teaser was later shown alongside ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]]'' in cinemas and is available for download in full quality surround sound HD from [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] to [[Xbox 360]].

===Animatics===
In July 2006, two clips of early, unfinished footage from the movie were shown to audiences during a ''Simpsons'' panel at [[Comic-Con]] 2006.<ref name="ani">{{cite news|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article.php?article_id=5687 |title=''Simpsons'' Movie Peeks at Comic-Con |accessdate=2006-07-25 |first=Ryan |last=Ball |date=[[2006-07-24]] |publisher=[[Animation Magazine]]}}</ref> The clips are black and white [[animatic]]s, presented in a 2.39:1 [[aspect ratio]]. Additionally, a new logo for the movie debuted at Comic-Con. The second animatic clip can also be found on the [[X-Men 3]] DVD. A third animatic clip was also released on The Simpsons Season 9 DVD.

====First clip====
The first clip <ref name=animatic>''The Simpsons Movie'' Preview Animatics [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604mN-fq8Yo Clip 1] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouSVH2e62_Y Clip 2] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afyu1Xz7FLY Clip 3] at [[YouTube]]</ref> shows an angry mob of<br/>
:'''Springfieldians''': (chanting) "We want Homer! We want Homer!"<br/>
:'''Lenny''': So, uh, who we gonna kill again?<br/>
:'''Moe''': Uh, I think the people in the front know.<br/>
[[Image:simpsons angry mob.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The angry mob coming after Homer.]]
And heading for the Simpsons' house, where Marge and Homer are hiding, looking out through a bedroom window.
:'''Marge:''' Look what you've done to us! Our only hope is for you to face that mob and apologize for what you did.<br/>
:'''Homer:''' I would, but I'm afraid if I open the door they'll take all of you!<br/>
:'''Carl:''' ''(off screen)'' No, we won't. We just want Homer!<br/>
:'''Homer:''' Well maybe not you, but they'll kill Grampa!<br/>
:'''Grampa:''' ''(off screen)'' I'm part of the mob!<br/>
The angry mob brings a ladder up and climbs up to the bedroom.<br/>
:'''Lisa:''' Ladders! They've got ladders!<br/>
The mob breaks the window and people start climbing up one by one as Homer throws items at them as he shouts out puns.<br/>
:'''Homer:''' ''(throwing a lamp at the [[Captain Horatio McCallister|Sea Captain]])'' Lights out! ''(throwing a camera at the [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Blue-Haired Lawyer|Blue Haired Lawyer]])'' Say cheese! ''(throwing a [[doily]] at [[Dr. Hibbert]])'' And uh... hello doily!<br/>
:'''Dr. Hibbert:''' I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!<br/>
Homer screams and runs as the crowd starts coming in through the window. Downstairs, the mob breaks through the front door and runs into the house, breaking everything in their way.<br/>
:'''Krusty:''' Teeny! Take out the baby.<br/>
Maggie smashes her bottle, points it at [[List_of_recurring_characters_from_The_Simpsons#Mr._Teeny|Mr. Teeny]] as a weapon and they make [[karate]] gestures at each other.<br/>

====Second clip====
The second clip <ref name=animatic /> begins with a voice over:<br/>
:'''Homer''': "Hi I'm Homer Simpson, and don't tell Fox, but here's an unfinished scene from The Simpsons Movie. It's a work in progress so I don't want anyone asking stupid questions like 'Hey, what happened to the color?'".<br/>
[[Image:homer dogs.png|right|thumb|250px|Homer is attacked by his [[sleigh dog]]s.]]
As Homer says this, the movie logo on screen fades to black and white and he yells "Hey, what happened to the color?!"<br/>
In the first scene, Homer is in an [[arctic]] location on a [[dogsled]], whipping the dogs and repeatedly yelling "Run!" at them. In the next scene, the dogs are sleeping and Homer continues to whip them, now yelling "Rest!" The dogs are then seen running again.<br/>
:'''Homer''': "Okay. That's enough whipping for now... with ''this'' arm!"<br/>
He proceeds to whip them with his other arm. Night falls, they stop to rest, and Homer begins to untie them.<br/>
:'''Homer''':"Now I know we've had a rough day, but I'm sure we can put all that behind us and just..."<br/>
The dogs viciously attack Homer as he screams and yells "Ow, that's my whipping arm!" and then run away. <br/>
:'''Homer''':"Why does everything I whip leave me?"<br/>

This clip is shown as a special feature on the ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' DVD, and the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown]] DVD, except the clip ends after the dogs run away and Homer does not say the final line.

====Third clip====
A third animatic<ref name="animatic" />, found on The Simpsons Complete Ninth Season DVD, begins with the same voice over as the previous clip. Marge and Homer are standing in their back yard next to a small [[storage silo|silo]] Homer built labeled "PIG CRAP".
[[Image:simpsons movie animatic 3.png|right|thumb|250px|Marge and Homer look at the silo in their back yard.]]
:'''Marge''': Hmm, I don't think that's what silos are for.
:'''Homer''': Are you questioning my farming skills?
:'''Marge''': Homer, it's leaking.
:'''Homer''': It's not leaking, it's overflowing.
:'''Marge''': He filled up the whole silo in just two days?!
:'''Homer''': Well, I helped.
:'''Marge''': Homer, stop! I know it's easy for your mind to wander...
We see a monkey inside Homer's brain playing [[cymbal]]s and dancing.
:'''Marge''': ...But I want you to ''really'' concentrate on me.
The monkey stops playing and points at Marge
:'''Marge''': God spoke to us for a reason. I'm not quite sure what that reason is, but I'm asking you, ''please'' dispose of that waste properly.
:'''Homer''': Okay, Marge.
Homer drives (with a pig in the passenger seat) to a lake with hundreds of "No dumping" signs placed about and proceeds to run over all of them in his path. As he does this, we see the camera from his point of view and the signs he runs over read, "No Dumping", "We Mean It", "Please Reconsider", "Have You No Heart?", "Stop Dammit Stop", "Why Must You Do This?", "You're Killing Us, Dude", and "Bastard!!!". He stops beside the river.
:'''Homer''': This feels right.
He cuts the silo loose and it drops into the lake.

===Theatrical Trailer===
A one and a half minute long trailer was first seen on [[November 12]], [[2006]] on FOX, immediately after the second act of ''The Simpsons'' episode ''[[G.I. (Annoyed Grunt)]]''.<ref>http://www.animationmagazine.net/article.php?article_id=6117</ref>

The trailer begins with a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated]] scene of a picturesque meadow, filled with flowers and butterflies. A rabbit hops from a hole in the ground, and begins dancing from rock to rock to the tune of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[The Nutcracker|Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy]]. The rabbit continues dancing, now along with flowers, as [[Don LaFontaine|a voice over]] says "In a time when computer animation brings us worlds of unsurpassed beauty, one film dares to be ugly."

The Simpsons Movie logo with [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] in the center of the donut falls into view, and knocks down the rabbit and the flowers. Moe says "The Simpsons Movie", and then holds out his arms and grandly announces "In [[2D]]!" Moe then looks down at the rabbit, and says "Uh... The bunny's not breathing."

[[Image:Simpsons movie trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Homer riding a wrecking ball in the November 12, 2006 TV trailer]]
The trailer then changes to a scene of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] driving a [[crane (machine)|crane]] with a [[wrecking ball]], and saying "Time to save my family" in a determined voice.

The crane moves forward, and swings the wrecking ball towards a truck on an adjacent road. The ball reaches the end of its arc as it reaches the truck, and merely nudges it. As the ball reaches the truck, there is a stop sign in the background. It actually says [[Standing operating procedure|SOP]]. This may be a reference to the rumor of Homer polluting the town's water supply. The ball then swings back towards the crane, smashes through the cab, and carries Homer up into the air.

The ball continues to swing back and forth, crashing Homer into the elbow of a large [[Paul Bunyan]] statue in front of a gas station, and a big fake fork attached to a billboard advertising the "Zesty Fork" restaurant. Homer is then swung repeatedly back and forth [[between a rock and a hard place|between a large rock and a building with the sign "A Hard Place"]], before the wrecking ball finally loses momentum and stays still.

Then, the message "In Theaters Worldwide July 27, 2007" appears. After a few seconds, the trailer flashes back to the previous scene, where the stilled wrecking ball, with Homer still aboard, suddenly smashes into the rock again and then breaks from its chain and crashes into the ground.

The trailer then ends as the movie's website is shown, while Homer says "This film is not yet rated" woozily in the background.

In [[Australia]], [[Network Ten]] aired the trailer on [[November 13]], [[2006]].

Five countries will have the movie released before the "In Theaters Worldwide July 27, 2007" release date - this is shown on the official 20th Century Fox [http://www.foxinternational.com/ international] websites for the countries listed.  [[Belgium]] and [[France]] will release it [[25 July]] and [[Argentina]], [[Germany]] and [[The Netherlands]] will release it on [[26 July]] [[2007]].

=== UK, Russian, Latin America, Spain and Australian Exclusive Trailer===
The one-and-a-half minute trailer appeared on the Sun Newspaper's website and first shown on December 11, 2006.<ref>{{cite news | title = The Simpsons Movie - UK Exclusive Trailer! | publisher = The Sun | date = 2006-12-11 | url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/simpsons | accessdate = 2006-12-12}}</ref>

The trailer begins with the same CGI dance sequence as the theatrical trailer, and then shows Homer and Bart on the roof of their house, with Homer preparing to hammer a nail into a shingle. Homer says "Steady... Steady..." holding the hammer ready over the nail. He swings, misses the nail, and embeds the hammer head in his eye, and Bart laughs at his pain. The release date is shown, and then the scene returns to Homer and Bart on the roof, with Homer again preparing to knock in a nail. Homer says "Steady... Steady..." again, swings, and suddenly the roof beneath him collapses and he falls down into the house with Bart looking down at him. The trailer ends just like the theatrical trailer, with the website being shown and the film being not rated.
In other markets, this teaser trailer was shown when ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'' was released on [[14 December]] [[2006]]. In North America, It was shown when ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' released on [[December 22]]nd, [[2006]]. Then on [[December 24]]th, [[2006]], the trailer was on Apple Movie Trailers and given an official North America name, "Trailer 2".

==Production==
The people behind ''The Simpsons'' had entertained the thought of a movie since early in the series, but things never came together. The episode "[[Kamp Krusty]]" was originally going to be a movie, but difficulties were encountered in writing a movie length script, at which point the movie plans were dropped in favor of a [[season premiere]].<ref>As described in the episodes commentary of [[The_Simpsons_DVD_boxsets#The_Complete_Fourth_Season|The Simpsons - The Complete Fourth Season]] by James L. Brooks</ref> Before his death, [[Phil Hartman]] had always wanted to do a [[live action]] [[Troy McClure]] movie. Several of the show's writers mentioned in DVD commentaries that they would have loved to do it. [[Matt Groening]] has revealed that they had been offered the chance to make a live-action Simpsons Movie, but turned it down as it would have likely ruined the franchise and angered fans. The writers of the show began working on the current script in 2001.<ref name="usa" />

===Rumors and speculation===
Rumors of a Simpsons movie have been circulating since early in the series. Speculation had seen a decrease until 2000, when news website [http://corona.bc.ca Corona] posted an [[April Fool's Day]] [[hoax]] describing fictional plans for a live action movie.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20000511131708/www.corona.bc.ca/films/details/simpsonsmovie.html The Simpsons Movie] at Corona.bc.ca, April 1, 2000</ref> In 2004, rumors of a movie development spiked, with sources claiming that it would premiere on [[July 27]] [[2007]]; this was confirmed by [[20th Century Fox]] on June 6, 2005.

==Technical specifications==

The film will be colored digitally and presented in a 2.39:1 aspect ratio (the equivalent of [[anamorphic widescreen]] film).<!--This does not need to be cited - all relevant information is contained within the linked article.--> Such a wide aspect ratio is somewhat more difficult for [[traditional animation]], especially in long horizontal camera pans, as it requires wider backgrounds to be drawn. However, this format gives the animation a more "cinematic" feel and sets it apart from the 4:3, or "[[full frame]]", format of the television series.
