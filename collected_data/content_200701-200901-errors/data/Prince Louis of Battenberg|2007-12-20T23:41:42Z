[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Louis Alexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven''', [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] ([[24 May]] [[1854]] – [[11 September]] [[1921]]), formerly '''Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg''', was a minor [[Germany|German]] [[prince]] who married a granddaughter of Britain's [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and pursued a distinguished career in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom's]] [[Royal Navy]], becoming a protégé of his future king, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]].

The Queen and Edward, when Prince of Wales, occasionally intervened in his career—the Queen thought that there was "a belief that the Admiralty are afraid of promoting Officers who are Princes on account of the radical attacks of low papers and scurrilous ones".<ref>[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] to [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Lord George Hamilton]] [[5 September]] [[1891]], [[Royal Archives]] E5 6/45</ref> However, Louis welcomed battle assignments that provided opportunities for him to acquire the skills of war and to demonstrate to his superiors that he was serious about his naval career. Posts on royal yachts and tours actually impeded his progress, as his promotions were perceived as royal favours rather than deserved.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Hough|authorlink=Richard Hough|title=Louis and Victoria: The Family History of the Mountbattens. Second edition|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1984|pages=p.173|isbn=0297784706}}</ref> However, he rose through the command ranks on his own merit and eventually served as [[First Sea Lord]], the senior uniformed officer in the Royal Navy, from 1912 to 1914 until he was forced to resign when anti-German feeling was running high at the start of [[World War I]].

He was the father of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and [[Louise Mountbatten|Queen Louise of Sweden]], and was the maternal grandfather of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], consort of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. One of his younger brothers, [[Alexander of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander of Battenberg]], was selected with the approval of Europe's [[Power (international)|Great Powers]] to mount the throne of [[Bulgaria]], where he reigned as [[Prince|sovereign Prince]] from 1879 to 1886. 

==Early life==
''His [[Illustrious Highness]] [[Count]] Louis (Ludwig) Alexander of [[Battenberg]]'' was born in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], the eldest son of [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] by his [[morganatic marriage]] to [[Count|Countess]] [[Julia von Hauke]]. Denied his father's [[dynastic]] rights and [[Royal and noble ranks|rank]] in [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], from birth he acquired the title of count and [[Honorific|style]] of "Illustrious" conferred upon his mother at the time of her marriage, automatically becoming ''[[Serene Highness|His Serene Highness]] Prince Louis of Battenberg'' when she was elevated to ''Princess of Battenberg'' with the style of ''Serene Highness'' by decree of her husband's brother, [[Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse]] on [[26 December]] [[1858]].<ref name="ruv"/>

Shortly after his birth, Louis's father was stationed with the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] of occupation in Northern [[Italy]] during the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], and Louis's early years were spent either there or at Prince Alexander's two houses in Hesse, the castle of Heiligenberg in [[Jugenheim]] and the Alexander Palace in [[Darmstadt]]. His mother spoke French to him but he had an English governess, and as a consequence grew up trilingual.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kerr|first=Mark|title=Prince Louis of Battenberg|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|year=1934|pages=pp.4–5}}</ref>

Amongst the visitors entertained at Heiligenberg were Prince Alexander's relations, the [[Russian Imperial family]], and his cousin, [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse|Prince Louis of Hesse]].<ref>Hough, p.20</ref> Influenced by his cousin's wife, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]], a daughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s, and [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Alfred]], another of Queen Victoria's children, Louis became a naturalized [[United Kingdom|British]] subject and joined the [[Royal Navy]] on [[3 October]] [[1868]], at the age of fourteen. He was enlisted as a naval cadet aboard HMS ''[[HMS Victory|Victory]]'', [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s old flagship.<ref>Kerr, pp.7–8</ref> In January of the following year, the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] cruised the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]]s in the frigate ''Ariadne'', and the Prince of Wales requested that Louis be appointed to the vessel,<ref>Kerr, p.9–10</ref> before his training was complete.<ref>Hough, p.61</ref> As part of the same tour, Louis also accompanied them on a visit to [[Egypt]], visiting the construction site of the [[Suez canal]]. As was traditional, the [[Khedive]] bestowed honours on the party and Louis received the [[Medjidie]] (Fourth Class).<ref>Kerr, p.14–16</ref> In April, he received the Osmanie (Fourth Class) from the [[Ottoman Sultan]].<ref>Kerr, p.18</ref>

==Early naval career==
[[Image:LouisofBattenberg1869.jpg|thumb|Prince Louis of Battenberg photographed by Carl Backofen in Darmstadt, 1869]]

Louis returned to Britain in May. In June he joined the ''Royal Alfred'', the flagship of the [[North America]] and [[West Indies]] station, becoming a [[midshipman]] in October.<ref>Kerr, p.19–23</ref> From June to September 1870 he took leave in [[Germany]], coinciding with the [[Franco-Prussian war]],<ref>Kerr, pp.25–27</ref> but he spent the next three-and-a-half years in the Americas, where his tour of duty served to make up for the training he had missed while posted with the Prince of Wales on the ''Ariadne''.<ref>Hough, pp.67, 69 and 73</ref> Returning to Europe in early 1874, he was posted to the shore establishment [[HMS Excellent|HMS ''Excellent'']],<ref>Kerr, p.34 and p.xiii</ref> and passed the Sub-Lieutenant's examinations—gaining the best marks ever recorded at seamanship and joint best ever at gunnery.<ref>Hough, p.76</ref> 

In 1875, again at the invitation of the Prince of Wales, he joined the ''[[HMS Serapis (1866)|Serapis]]'', which conducted the Prince on an official tour of [[India]], 1875–1876.<ref>Kerr, p.36</ref> Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the [[Illustrated London News]].<ref>Hough, p.80</ref> The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at [[Marlborough House]] for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant onboard the ''[[HMS Sultan (1870)|Sultan]]''.<ref name="p51">Kerr, p.51</ref> In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy<ref>Kerr, p.63 and Hough, p.87</ref> and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands in bed as it ran across his chest.<ref>Kerr, p.64</ref> The ''Sultan'' toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.<ref name="p51"/> 

In late February–early March 1878 Louis was still serving on the ''Sultan'' as it lay in the [[Bosphorus]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]]. He was criticized for visiting his brother, [[Alexander of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander]], who was serving with the Russian forces, but an investigation cleared both of them and Prince Alfred of any wrongdoing.<ref>Kerr, p.69</ref> For the next two years he served on the ''[[HMS Agincourt (1865)|Agincourt]]'' and on the Royal Yacht ''Osborne'', but in October 1879 he refused further service on the Royal Yacht, saying it was damaging his professional career, and requested half-pay until he could be given an active duty.<ref>Kerr, p.70</ref> On [[17 February]] [[1880]] he, his father and [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] witnessed an explosion at the [[Winter Palace]] when Stephen Chalturin unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the Tsar with dynamite beneath the great dining room.<ref>Hough, pp.95–96</ref><ref>A year later, the Tsar was killed by a bomb thrown by another assassin.</ref>

[[Image:HMS Agincourt.jpg|thumb|left|240px|HMS ''Agincourt'' c.1878]]

On [[24 August]] [[1880]] Louis was posted to the ''[[HMS Inconstant|Inconstant]]'', the flag-ship of the Flying Squadron, which included ''Bacchante'' on which Princes [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence|Albert Victor]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George]] were serving. The ship sailed to [[South America]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Fiji]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]], before returning to [[South Africa]] in April 1882.<ref>Kerr, pp.71–99</ref> Seven months after Louis left Britain on the voyage, actress [[Lillie Langtry]] allegedly bore him an illegitimate daughter, [[Jeanne Marie Langtry|Jeanne Marie]]. Langtry was also a one-time mistress of the Prince of Wales. Jeanne Marie's parentage was never completely verified, but Louis made a financial settlement nonetheless.<ref name="dnb">{{citation |last=Hurd |first=Archibald |title=Mountbatten, Louis Alexander, first marquess of Milford Haven [formerly Prince Louis of Battenberg] (1854–1921) |coauthors=rev.

From South Africa the ''Inconstant'' sailed to [[St Helena]], and the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, where the squadron received orders to proceed to [[Gibraltar]], and from there to [[Malta]] and Egypt to take part in the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War|Egyptian intervention]].<ref>Kerr, p.100</ref> On [[11 July]] [[1882]], [[Alexandria]] was bombarded and in the next two weeks Louis served in the Flying Squadron delivering shells and ammunition to the battle fleet, and then as a guard to the Khedive at [[Ras Al Teen Palace]].<ref>Kerr, p.101</ref> He was decorated with the Egypt War Medal by Queen Victoria personally.<ref>Hough, p.105</ref> 

In November 1882, he left the ''Inconstant'', spent Christmas in [[Darmstadt]], and in March the following year visited his brother, Prince Alexander, in [[Bulgaria]], of which Alexander had been made Sovereign Prince.<ref>Kerr, p.103</ref> Louis accompanied his brother on a state visit to [[Turkey]] and then on a tour of [[Cyprus]] and the [[Holy Land]] with the Turkish navy, during which Louis was appalled at the lack of seamanship—the Turkish captains were unable to navigate and had to hug the coast in order not to get lost; when they did leave the coast they became so disoriented that they were unable to steer for [[Jaffa]]. On its return journey the ship they had travelled on grounded.<ref>Kerr, p.106</ref>

==Marriage and family==
[[Image:LouisofBattenberg1884.jpg|thumb|Prince Louis of Battenberg photographed by Elliott and Fry in London, 1884]]

In September 1883, Queen Victoria appointed him to her yacht, ''Victoria and Albert''. On [[30 April]] [[1884]] in the presence of the Queen, Prince Louis married her granddaughter, [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]] at [[Darmstadt]].<ref>Kerr, p.107</ref> His wife was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria's second daughter [[Princess Alice of Great Britain and Ireland|Alice]] by [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]]. Through the Hesse family, Prince and Princess Louis of Battenberg were first cousins once removed. They had known each other since childhood,<ref>Vickers, p.7</ref> and invariably spoke English to each other.<ref>Kerr, p.109 and Vickers, p.20</ref> As wedding presents Louis received the British [[Order of the Bath]] and the Star and Chain of the [[Ludewigsorden|Hessian Order of Louis]].<ref>Hough, p.119</ref>

Louis and Victoria had four children:
*HSH Princess [[Princess Alice of Battenberg|Alice]] ([[25 February]] [[1885]] – [[5 December]] [[1969]]) m. HRH [[Prince Andrew of Greece|Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark]] ([[1 February]] [[1882]] – [[3 December]] [[1944]]). Among her children is [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]];
*HSH Princess [[Louise Mountbatten|Louise]], later styled Lady Louise Mountbatten ([[13 July]] [[1889]] – [[2 March]] [[1965]]) m. Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, later King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]] ([[11 November]] [[1882]] – [[15 September]] [[1973]]);
*HSH Prince [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven|George]], who became George Mountbatten, Earl of Medina in 1917, and succeeded his father as 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven in 1921, ([[6 November]] [[1892]] – [[8 April]] [[1938]]) m. [[Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven|Countess Nadejda (Nada) de Torby]] ([[28 March]] [[1896]] – [[22 January]] [[1963]]); and
*HSH Prince [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis]], later 1st [[Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] ([[25 June]] [[1900]] – [[August 27]] [[1979]]) m. Edwina Ashley ([[28 November]] [[1900]] – [[21 February]] [[1960]]).<ref>She was co-heiress of the vast banking fortune of her maternal grandfather, [[Ernest Cassel|Sir Ernest Cassel]]; daughter of Wilfred Ashley, later [[Baron Mount Temple]]; and male-line great-granddaughter of the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|7th Earl of Shaftesbury]].</ref>

One of Louis's younger brothers, [[Prince Henry of Battenberg]], married [[Princess Beatrice, Princess Henry of Battenberg|Princess Beatrice]], the youngest child of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], and took up residence with the Queen in Britain so that Beatrice could continue to serve as her mother's companion and private secretary.<ref>{{citation|first=A.

==Later naval career==
[[Image:HMSDreadnought1875.jpeg|thumb|left|220px|HMS ''Dreadnought'' c.1894]]

On his penultimate day aboard the Queen's yacht, [[30 August]] [[1885]], he was promoted to [[commander]].<ref>Kerr, p.xii</ref> The next four years were spent in ''[[HMS Excellent|Excellent]]'' and ''Vernon'' on half-pay, at HMS ''Cambridge'' very briefly at [[Milford Haven]] in August 1886, and onboard [[HMS Dreadnought (1875)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] in the Mediterranean.<ref>Kerr, p.xiii and p.110</ref> [[Irish nationalist]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[William Hoey Kearney Redmond|Willie Redmond]] questioned the appointment to ''Dreadnought'' in the [[British House of Commons]], suggesting it was due to royal favour—a suggestion denied by the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Lord George Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ziegler|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Ziegler|title=Mountbatten|publisher=Collins|location=London|year=1985|pages=p.23|isbn=0002165430}}</ref> On [[3 October]] [[1889]] he was appointed to his first independent command, HMS ''Scout'', a torpedo-cruiser, which saw service in the [[Red Sea]].<ref>Kerr, pp.111–114</ref>

On [[31 December]] [[1891]] Prince Louis rose to the rank of [[captain]]<ref>Kerr, p.166</ref> and became an aide-de-camp to the Queen, a post he would retain under both King Edward VII and [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].<ref>Kerr, p.138</ref> At the beginning of the following year, he was appointed naval advisor to the inspector-general of fortifications. His role was to act as a liaison between the navy and the army in order to ensure a co-ordinated defence.<ref name="dnb" /> Traditionally, there was a great deal of friction between the two services, but Louis exercised his social skills in the role, leading [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]] to write to him, "You have produced a mutual feeling of goodwill and unanimity which I have always wished to see established, and which, by your tact and sound judgement, you have brought about to the fullest extent."<ref>Kerr, p.118</ref> 

In 1892, Battenberg invented the [[Battenberg Course Indicator]],<ref>''The Battenberg Course Indicator'', [[Royal Navy]] document [http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ou5274.htm OU5274 ''Remarks on Handling a Ship''], [[1934]]</ref><ref>Lee, Annabel;  [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9902EEDF103EE733A25751C1A9679D946497D6CF&oref=slogin "Louis of Bettenberg: A talk with the Sailor-Prince"], [[New York Times]], [[12 November]] [[1905]].

Retrieved on 2007-10-01</ref> and which remains in use today albeit in more modern materials. 

By February 1894 his role was further developed when he was appointed joint secretary of the naval and military committee on defence, which was later renamed the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]].<ref name="dnb" /> Louis captained the ''Cambrian'' in the Mediterranean Fleet from October 1894 to May 1897 and the ''[[HMS Majestic (1895)|Majestic]]'' in the Channel Fleet from June 1897.<ref>Kerr, pp.121–122</ref> His careful study of both naval and military defence, as well as its interaction, led to his appointment as Assistant Director of the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] in June 1899.<ref>Kerr, p.xiv</ref> He used his relationships with the royal houses of Europe to gather intelligence on the naval fleets of other nations, which he passed onto the Admiralty in full and detailed reports.<ref>Hough, pp.179, 185–186</ref>

After a year as captain of [[HMS Implacable (1899)|HMS ''Implacable'']] in the Mediterranean, during which he spectacularly defeated a larger opposing force during naval exercises,<ref>Hough, p.223–225</ref> Louis was appointed as [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Director of Naval Intelligence]] in November 1902.<ref>Kerr, pp.142–157</ref> He was promoted to [[Rear Admiral|rear admiral]] on [[1 July]] [[1904]], in which year his family connections to the royal courts of Europe helped resolve the [[Dogger Bank incident]] peacefully.<ref name="dnb" /> The following February, he was given command of the second cruiser squadron, with [[HMS Drake (1901)|HMS ''Drake'']] as his flag ship. During a successful two years the squadron visited [[Greece]], [[Portugal]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]], where the American press commented favourably on Prince Louis's courtesy, unassuming manner and democratic nature.<ref>Kerr, p.185–206</ref><ref>Lee, ibid</ref> After two years at the head of the second cruiser squadron, and further visits to [[Spain]] (where his niece [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] was Queen), he was appointed second-in-command of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean fleet]] as acting vice-admiral with [[HMS Venerable|HMS ''Venerable'']] as his flagship.<ref>Kerr, pp.214–221</ref>

After less than six months in post his flag was transferred to [[HMS Prince of Wales (1902)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] in August 1907. The following year, he was promoted to Vice-Admiral, and appointed as Commander-in-Chief, [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]]. In 1909, he published a translation of Commander Vladimir Semenoff's ''Rasplata'' (The Reckoning), a memoir of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–5, and witnessed the first crossing of the [[English Channel]] by air by [[Louis Blériot]].<ref>Kerr, pp.230–231</ref> He was appointed as commander of the newly constituted Third and Fourth Divisions of the [[Home Fleet]] two years later. The years immediately preceding this appointment were marred by disagreements between Admirals [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jacky Fisher]] and [[Lord Charles Beresford]] over the direction of the navy and the imposition of reforms. Louis largely supported Fisher's modernising efforts, although he disapproved of Fisher's methods, and as a result Fisher's opponents attempted to prevent Louis's promotions.<ref>Hough, pp.237–239</ref> Eventually, both Beresford and Fisher left active service but Fisher's reforms were retained. Fisher recommended Louis as [[First Sea Lord]]: "He is the most capable administrator in the Admiralty's list by a long way"<ref>Jacky Fisher to Winston Churchill [[25 October]] [[1911]] quoted in Hough, p.245</ref> but elements of the British press were against his appointment on the grounds that he was a German saying it was "a crime against our Empire to trust our secrets of National Defence to any alien-born official".<ref>Horatio Bottomley in ''John Bull'' [[2 November]] [[1911]] quoted in Hough, p.246</ref> In December 1911, Louis did return to the [[Admiralty]] but as [[Second Sea Lord|Second]] rather than First Sea Lord. As Second Sea Lord, Louis pushed through improvements in working conditions for the enlisted men, and created a Naval War Staff that would prepare the navy's plans in case of war.<ref>Hough, pp.244–256</ref>

However, almost a year to the day later, on [[8 December]] [[1912]], Prince Louis assumed the post of First Sea Lord in succession to [[Francis Charles Bridgeman Bridgeman|Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman]], who had retired in ill-health.<ref>Kerr, p.238</ref> In that capacity, he was responsible to the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]] for the readiness of the fleet and the preparation of naval strategy, as well as the development of a scheme for state insurance of merchant vessels in times of war, which was to prove essential in preventing prohibitive insurance rates that would have stifled British trade.<ref>Hough, p.272</ref> On the eve of [[World War I]] he unilaterally<ref>Churchill was away for the weekend (25–[[26 July]]) but was consulted about, and approved Prince Louis's decision.</ref> made the crucial decision to cancel the scheduled dispersal of the British fleet following practice manoeuvres in order to preserve the Royal Navy's battle readiness.<ref>Kerr, p.243</ref><ref name="dnb" /> Nonetheless with the outbreak of war, rising anti-German sentiment among the British public, newspapers, and elite [[Gentlemen's club (traditional)|gentlemen's club]]s (where resentment was inflamed by Admiral [[Lord Charles Beresford]] despite Churchill's remonstrances)<ref>Hough, pp.302–303</ref> drove Churchill to ask Prince Louis to resign as [[First Sea Lord]] on [[27 October]] [[1914]],<ref>Hough, p.307</ref> which Louis did amidst an outpouring of appreciation from politicians and his naval comrades. [[George V of the United Kingdom|The King]] swore Louis in as a [[Privy Council]]lor in a public show of support.<ref name="dnb" /> [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] party politician and [[trade union]] leader, [[James Henry Thomas|J. H. Thomas]] wrote to ''[[The Times]]'': "I desire to express my extreme regret at the announcement that Prince Louis of Battenberg has, by his resignation, pandered to the most mean and contemptible slander I have ever known … I was simply astounded to hear the base suggestions and rumours current, and I am afraid that his action will simply be looked upon as a triumph for the mean and miserable section of people, who, at a time of national trial, is ever ready to pass a foul lie from lip to lip without a tittle of evidence."<ref>''[[The Times|The Times (London)]]'' [[November 4]] [[1914]]</ref> [[Lord John Hay (admiral of the fleet)|Admiral of the Fleet John Hay]] thought that the "ingeniously propagated lies" originated from [[German Empire|Germany]].<ref>''The Times (London)'' [[November 1]] [[1914]]</ref> Prince Louis held no official post for the remainder of the war and lived in retirement at Kent House on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>Kerr, p.259</ref> He occupied his time in writing a comprehensive encyclopedia on Naval Medals published in three large volumes, which became the standard reference work on the subject.<ref>Kerr, p.265</ref> His naval career had been characterised by industry, invention and intellect; he introduced mechanical calculators to compute navigations and a cone signalling apparatus.<ref name="dnb" /> Although assured that he would be returned to command post-war, he was asked to retire from the Navy's active list in 1918.<ref>Hough, p.330</ref>

==Adoption of the surname Mountbatten==
[[Image:George V of the United Kingdom - Punch cartoon - Project Gutenberg eText 16113.png|right|thumb|A 1917 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon depicting King George V sweeping away the German titles held by members of his family.]]

Persistent rumours that the [[British Royal Family]] must be pro-German, given their dynastic origins and many German relatives, prompted the King to abandon his subsidiary German dynastic titles and adopt an [[House of Windsor|English surname]]. At the behest of the King, Louis relinquished the title Prince of Battenberg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, and also the style of Serene Highness, on [[14 July]] [[1917]]. At the same time, Louis anglicized his family name, changing it from "[[Battenberg family|Battenberg]]" to "[[Mountbatten]]," having considered but rejected "Battenhill" as an alternative.<ref>Hough, p.317</ref> On [[17 July]], the King created him ''[[Marquess of Milford Haven]], Earl of Medina, and Viscount Alderney'' in the [[peerage of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=30374|startpage=11592|endpage=11594|date=[[9 November]] [[1917]]|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref> The King's British relatives in the [[Teck]], [[House of Oldenburg|Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Gleichen]] families underwent similar changes. Louis's wife ceased to use her own title of Princess of Hesse and became known as the Marchioness of Milford Haven. His three younger children ceased to use their princely titles and assumed courtesy titles as children of a British marquess; his eldest daughter, Princess Alice, had married into the Greek royal family in 1903, and never had occasion to use the surname Mountbatten. However, her only son, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] of Greece and Denmark, adopted the name when he became a British subject in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalinsight.gov.uk/output/page5657.asp|title=Royal Family name|publisher=Official web site of the British Monarchy|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref>

While the transition in names and titles was being effected, Louis spent some time at the home of his eldest son, George, who had married [[Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven|Countess Nadejda (Nada) de Torby]] the year before.<ref>Nada de Torby ([[28 March]] [[1896]] – [[22 January]] [[1963]]) was the [[Morganatic branches of the Russian Imperial Family|morganatic]] daughter of [[Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia]] by [[Count of Merenberg|Countess Sophie von Merenberg, Countess Torby]], herself the daughter of a morganatic marriage between [[Prince]] Nicholas of [[Duke of Nassau|Nassau]] and Natalia Aleksandrovna Pushkin, daughter of [[Alexander Pushkin]].</ref> After anglicizing his surname to ''Mountbatten'' and becoming Marquess of Milford Haven, Louis wrote in his son's guestbook, "Arrived Prince Hyde, Departed Lord [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Jekyll]]".<ref>Kerr, p.289</ref>

During the war, two of Louis's sisters-in-law ([[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra of Hesse]], and [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]]) were murdered by the [[Bolshevik]]s in Russia. Eventually, in January 1921, after a long and convoluted journey, the body of Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna was interred in [[Jerusalem]] in the presence of Louis and his wife.<ref>Kerr, p.261</ref>

==Final years and death==
In 1919, the Mountbattens had to give up their home, Kent House, for financial reasons.<ref>Kerr, p.290</ref> He sold his collection of naval medals. All of his financial investments in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] were seized by the Bolsheviks and his German property became valueless with the collapse of the [[German Papiermark|mark]].<ref name="end">Kerr, p.293</ref> He sold Heiligenberg Castle, which he had inherited from his father, in 1920.<ref>Vickers, p.155</ref><ref>Of the family's two residences in Hesse, the Alexander Palace in Darmstadt returned to the grand duchy as part of the [[Appanage|appanaged]] patrimony of Louis's father, Prince Alexander of Hesse, from which his children by Julia, Princess of Battenberg were debarred. However, the castle of Heiligenberg in Jugenheim had been bequeathed to Prince Alexander as personal property.</ref>

Louis was promoted to the rank of [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] and awarded a second GCB in recognition of his service to the [[Royal Navy]] in August 1921.<ref>Hough, p.332</ref> A few days later he joined [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']], the ship on which his son Louis was serving, for a week at the invitation of the captain [[Dudley Pound]].<ref>Ziegler, p.60</ref> It was his last voyage; he died at 42 Half Moon Street, [[Piccadilly]], [[London]] in the annexe of the [[Naval & Military Club]] on [[11 September]] [[1921]] of heart failure following [[influenza]]. After a funeral service at [[Westminster Abbey]], his remains were buried at Whippingham Church on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref name="end" />

Louis's elder son, [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven|George Mountbatten]], who had received the courtesy title Earl of Medina, succeeded him as 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven. [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis's younger son]], styled Lord Louis Mountbatten after 1917, served as the last [[Viceroy of India]] and was created Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1947 and also served as the Royal Navy's [[Admiral of the Fleet]].<ref name="bp"/>
