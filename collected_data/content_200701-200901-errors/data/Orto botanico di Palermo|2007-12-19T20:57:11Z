[[Image:Orto botanico PA.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Palermo - Historical view of the Botanical Garden.]]
The '''Orto Botanico di Palermo''' (''Palermo Botanical Garden'') is both a [[botanic garden]]  and a research and educational institution forming part of, and managed by, the Department of Botany of the [[University of Palermo]].  The garden lies within the city of [[Palermo]] ({{Coor dms|38|06|44|N|13|11|15|E}}), at 10 metres above sea-level. It covers about {{convert|30|acre|sqkm|-1}} on top of red soil that has evolved on a calcareous tufaceous substratum.

==Brief history==

The earliest beginnings of the gardens go back to [[1779]], when  the ''Accademia dei Regi Studi'' created the chair of  "[[Botany]] and medicinal properties".   They were allocated a modest plot of land to develop a small botancial garden dedicated to the cultivation of plants with medicinal benefits for the twin objectives of general learning and improving [[public health]].

This initial garden allotment soon proved insufficient for the purposes for which it was intended  and in [[1786]] it was decided to move to the present site, right next to the ''[[Piano di Sant'Erasmo]]'', best remembered for the  unfortunate events that occurred during the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. In [[1789]] construction of the main part of the administrative buildings of the garden commenced in a [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style. It is constructed with a central building, the ''Gymnasium'', and two side buildings, the ''Tepidarium''and the ''Calidarium'', designed by the Frenchman [[Léon Dufourny]], who had also designed a part of the oldest section of garden, right next to the ''Gymnasium''. It consists of a rectangular lay out, divided into 4 quadrangles, within which the species are categorised according to [[Carolus Linnaeus]]' system of classification. The new garden was opened in [[1795]];  in the ensuing years it was improved,  with the ''Acquarium'' ([[1798]]), a great pool  hosting numerous species of acquatic plants, and the ''serra Maria Carolina'' (or Maria Carolina glasshouse), completed in [[1823]]. The huge [[Ficus macrophylla|''Ficus magnolioides'']], which is a symbol and a well known attraction of the modern garden, was imported from [[Norfolk Island]] ([[Australia]]), in [[1845]].  Today's area, some 10 hectares, was reached in [[1892]], following successive extensions. In [[1913]] the ''Giardino coloniale'' (Colonial garden) was developed alongside the botanic gardens, but that no longer exists.  The gardens have been managed by the Department of Botany since [[1985]].

==Buildings, features and the collection==
===''Gymnasium, Calidarium and Tepidarium''===
The central neo-classical building, known as the ''Gymnasium'', is located near the main entrance gate.  Originally it was the main office of the  ''Schola Regia Botanice'' (school of botany), the ''[[Herbarium]]'', the library and the director's office.

Two smaller buildings are located either side of the ''Gymnasium'' in perfect symmetry.  To this day they are called the ''Calidarium'' and the ''Tepidarium''  because originally they housed plants from warm and temperate zones respectively (''caldo'' meaning "hot" in [[Italian language|Italian]]).

===Linneian section===
The is the oldest section of the gardens, laid out in a rectangular shape and divided into four quadrangles, the  "quatrains" (or ''quartini'').  Each quatrain is further divided into flowerbeds, within which the plants were originally organised along the lines of the linneian [[Scientific classification|system of classification]]. The design of this section has gradually changed over time to display certain specimens at the expense of others that are now gone.  At the centre of this section, is the particularly evocative “cross”, the small plaza that results from the intersection of the central axis (the ''Viale centrale'') with the tree lined avenue of palms (the ''Viale delle palme'').

===The Aquarium and other water features===
[[Image:Aquarium03 Orto botanico Palermo.jpg|thumb|''Aquarium'']]
The ''[[Aquarium]]'', a large round pool divided into 24 sections, is located at the end of the central avenue.  The design consists of three concentric rings which are divided into 8 wedges, each being a home to a variety of acqautic flora.  

The "lagoon" is located a few metres further down from the Acquariam  and is another ample water feature in which the plants are arranged informally. Other smaller ponds are located in the quatrains of the Linneian section.

===The greenhouses===
[[Image:Orto botanico Palermo 04.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Entrance of the ''Giardino d'Inverno'' ("Winter Garden").]]
Over time the gardens have benefitted from the development of a series of greenhouses that currently comprise a surface area of some 1,300 mq. 

The oldest of these greenhouses is the  ''serra  Maria Carolina'' (''serra'' is Italian for greenhouse), a gift from Queen [[Maria Carolina of Austria]], also known as the ''Giardino d'Inverno'' (the winter garden). Originally it was constructed of wood and heated by stoves,  over the course of the second half of the 19th century, it was completely rebuilt of cast-iron. 

Other greenhouses include:
*the greenhouse of succulents, containing plants from hot-arid zones;
*the experimental greenhouse, that currently house bananas and papaya ;
*the greenhouse of the region, containing plants of the warm-humid zones; 
*the greenhouse for the preservatoin of succulents, an annex of the Department of Botany;
*the greenhouse of ferns.

===Bioecological and geographic zone===
In this section plants are arranged according to bioecological and geographic criteria.   Here one finds the ''Giardino a succulente'' ("Garden of succulents"), consisting of an assortment of plants from the arid zones of [[Africa]]; the ''Palmetum''; the ''Cycadetum''; e la ''collinetta mediterranea'' (mediterranean hillside) which includes various significant species endemic to the [[Mediterranean]], including some specimens which represent rare and endangered species.

===Experimental and research zone===
In the experimental zone, situated to the side of the Winter Garden, tropical and subtropical plants are cultivated for the purposes of research.  Studies currently in train or recently undertaken include those on [[cotton]], [[vegetable]]s, [[sugar cane]] and [[sorghum]]. The zone dedicated to plants of a practical application, which extends  over the south west part of the gardens, consists of terrain set apart for plants yielding a variety of [[oil]]s, [[resin]]s and [[fibre]]s.

===Engler's zone===
Also known as the ''nuovo settore'' (the new zone), it comprises the southern section of the gardens within which the plants are arranged in accordance with the classification system of [[Adolf Engler|Engler]]. The species are partitioned into three sections, each dedicated in turn to the [[gymnosperm]]s, the [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]], the [[dicotyledon]]s and the  [[liliopsida]].

===The herbarium===
The modern  ''Herbarium mediterraneum'', accommodated within a few buildings adjacent to the gardens, covers a surface area of some 6,000 m².

The main part of the collection comprises the  ''Erbario Siculo'' and the ''Erbario Generale'' of the Department of Botany, estimated to be around 50,000 and 200,000 specimens respectively.   Of the latter group, around a quarter represent plants native to the mediterranean. 

The non Sicilian specimens are mainly from [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], [[Greece]], [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]], [[Algeria]] and [[Egypt]].

It also includes around 2,000 specimens of [[algae]], 1,600 of [[lichen]], 4,700 of [[bryophyte]] and a thousand odd of [[fungus]].

===Gene bank===

The gene bank, having been started in 1993, is part of a broader project to protect the [[DNA|genetic material]]  of the region's [[flora]].

The main objective of the bank is the conservation ''ex situ'', both short and long term, of all seeds endemic to the region, rare or endangered.  Once they have been collected, the [[seed]]s are immediately treated and conserved in ampoules, all managed by the institution and available for exchange with others. The seeds are periodically tested for their propensity to germinate.

The bank forms part of the RIBES network ([http://www.reteitalianagermoplasma.it/ Rete Italiana delle Banche per la conservazione Ex-Situ del germoplasma]).

==Summary of the species present==
''(See also the full list of species of plants growing in the gardens further below).''
[[Image:Ficus macrophylla011.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The typical aerial roots of the ''[[Ficus macrophylla]]'' (or the [[Moreton Bay Fig]])]]

The gardens are currently home to at least 12,000 different species.

Having been developed during the great age of [[exploration]], between the second half of the [[19th century]] and the first decades of the [[20th century]] the gardens became an important point of reference for the bigger botanical gardens of [[Northern Europe]].  Because of Palermo's favourable climate,  they transferred a good number of unknown, poorly classified and exotic tropical species there. In this context, the relationship between the [[Berlin Botanic Garden]], under the stewardship of [[Adolf Engler]], and those of the originating areas of the [[new world]] proved to be extremely important.

As an illustrative example of the role of the Palermo Botanic Garden, consider the introduction into the  [[Mediterranean]] of the [[Mandarin orange|mandarin]] ''(Citrus deliciosa)'' e the [[loquat]]  (''[[Eriobotrya japonica]]'').

The early linneian plantings  consisted of 1,580 different species, of which 658 still exist. Of these specimens, the most notable is the mighty ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]''. 

[[Image:Cyperus papyrus.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The ''Laghetto'' of papyrus]]
In the ''Aquarium'' many species of [[Nymphaea]] are to be found, including ''[[Nymphaea alba]]'', ''[[Nymphaea tuberosa]]'' hybrids of ''[[Nymphaea × marliacea]]'', the multicoloured ''[[Nuphar lutea]]'' and ''[[Nelumbum nucifera]]''. Moreover, in the areas further in that are not submerged but humid nevertheless, one finds ''[[Alocasia]]'', ''[[Colocasia]]'', ''[[Zantedeschia]]'', while in a nearby pond, the so called ''laghetto'',   [[Cyperus papyrus|Egyptian papyrus ''(Cyperus papyrus)'']] and other [[cyperaceae]] such as ''[[Scirpus lacustris]]'' and  ''[[Cyperus alternifolius]]'' are absolutely thriving. 

Various species of [[bamboo]] grow nearby and directly behind here, atop a small artificial hill, there is a healthy specimen of the [[drago]] tree (''[[Dracaena draco]]'').  Not too far away one can see the tallest plant of the gardens, a magnificent ''[[Araucaria columnaris]]'', and the largest overall in terms of volume, a gigantic specimen of  ''[[Ficus macrophylla]]'', with its typical aerial [[root]]s, imported from [[Norfolk Island]] (a territory of [[Australia]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]), in [[1845]].  It is also a native of the east coast of Australia and is known as the [[Moreton Bay Fig]].

The ''giardino a succulente'' (the garden of [[succulent]]s) of the bioecological zone is home to numerous species of the [[genus]] ''[[Aloe]]'' e  various other plants of arid regions, including ''[[Cereus]], [[Crassula]], [[Euphorbia]] and [[Opuntia]]''.  Alongside the collection of succulents, there is a huge specimen of ''[[Ficus rubiginosa]]'', recreating an environment reminiscent of a tropical [[jungle]].

In the area containing ''Cycadetum'' there are certain species of [[Cycadales|cicadi]] that have a notable history. Of these we have ''[[Cycas revoluta]]'', donated by Queen [[Maria Carolina]] in [[1793]],  was the first such specimen to find a permanent home in Europe. In the following stage of the gardens' development [[Zamiaceae]] ''[[Ceratozamia mexicana]]'' and ''[[Dioon edule]]'', were both introduced from [[Mexico]], as was ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'', an elegant species from the [[Indian sub-continent]].  In 1997 the collection was further improved by the acquisition of a variety of worthy specimens, including ''[[Dioon spinulosum]],  [[Encephalartos altensteinii]], [[Encephalartos longifolius]], [[Encephalartos villosus]], [[Macrozamia moorei]]'' and ''[[Zamia furfuracea]]''.

[[Image:Washingtonia philiphera.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Washingtonia filifera'']]
In the area dedicated to [[arecaceae|palm]]s one can find ''[[Chamaerops humilis]]'', the only palm  native to Sicily, and numerous exotic palms, in which the gardens are particularly blessed.  Amongst both potted and fully cultivated specimens,  one can count a good 34 genera and around 80 species. The genus ''[[Washingtonia]]'' is represented by ''[[Washingtonia filifera|W. filifera]]'', that flowered in Palermo for the first time ever,  and by ''[[Washingtonia robusta|W. robusta]]''. In the genus ''[[Phoenix (palm)|Phoenix]]'', apart from the common [[date palm|date]]  (''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]'') there are also ''[[Phoenix rupicola|P. rupicola]], [[Phoenix reclinata|P. reclinata]],  [[Phoenix canariensis|P. canariensis]],  [[Phoenix roebelinii|P. roebelinii]] and [[Phoenix teophrastii|P. teophrastii]]''. There are also many other genera: ''[[Chamaedorea]], [[Brahea]], [[Sabal]], [[Erythea]], [[Livistona]], [[Howea]] and [[Trachycarpus]]''.

The ''Giardino d'Inverno'' (Winter Garden) is home to a number of species native to the warmer climes of  [[Africa]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]]. Amongst those that are worth a brief mention, we have the [[coffee]] plant (''[[Coffea arabica]]''), papaya (''[[Carica papaya]]''), numerous species of ''[[Bougainvillea]]'' ,   [[cinnamon]] ''([[Cinnamomum ceylanicum]])'', ''([[Parmentiera cereifera]])'' and mimosa ''([[Mimosa spegazzinii]])''. In the  ''serra della Regione'' (glasshouse of the regions), there are potted specimens of ''([[Ravenala madagascariensis]])''  (the traveller's palm) and various species of ''[[Anthurium]], [[Codiaeum]], [[Pandanus]]'' and other plants from tropical and [[equator]]ial climes. Two smaller glasshouses are located alongside this one, housing [[orchid]]s and [[carnivorous plants]] respectively.  Also notable is the collection of [[succulent]]s contained in the similarly titled glasshouse, amongst which we find specimens of  ''[[Echinocactus grusonii]]'' of considerable dimensions. 

In the  ''Settore Sperimentale e delle Piante Utili''  (Experimental zone and zone of practical plantings) plants which produce foodstuffs are exhibited, such as [[sugarcane]] ''(Saccharum officinarum)'' and ''([[Sorghum saccharatum]])'', both used for the production of [[sugar]]; [[avocado]] ''(Persea americana)'',  various cultivars of [[banana]] (''[[Musa × paradisiaca]]'', ''[[Musa cavendishi]]''), [[pecan nut]] (''[[Carya olivaeformis]]''), not to mention an extensive collection of [[vegetable]] plants with over 100 cultivars of great historical interest and hugely important in terms of the conservation of a local gene pool. Lastly we have the medicinal plantings, including ''[[Artemisia absinthium]]'',  ''[[Datura stramonium]]'', [[ginseng]] (''[[Withania somnifera]]''), la [[camphour]] (''[[Cinnamomum canphora]]'') and the [[opium]] poppy (''[[Papaver somniferum]]'').

== Odd spot ==
For a few years now the gardens have been home to a colony of [[parrot]]s of the species '' [[Psittacula krameri]]'', having escaped from the avaries of the nearby Villa Giulia and are perfectly at home in the subtropical habitat of the gardens.

==Useful information==
The gardens are open to visitors during the working week from 9.00am to 5.00pm (from April to October to 6.00pm). 
Weekend hours are from  8.30am to 1.30pm.
