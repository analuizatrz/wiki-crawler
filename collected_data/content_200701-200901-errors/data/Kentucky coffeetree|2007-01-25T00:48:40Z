The '''Kentucky Coffeetree''', ''Gymnocladus dioicus'', is a [[tree]] in the subfamily [[Caesalpinioideae]] of the pea family [[Fabaceae]], native to the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]] of [[North America]]. The range is limited, occurring from the far south of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and in the [[United States]] from [[Kentucky]] (where it was first encountered by Europeans) and western [[Pennsylvania]] in the east, to [[Kansas]],eastern [[Nebraska]], and southeastern [[South Dakota]] in the west, and to northern [[Louisiana]] in the south. It was formerly the state tree of [[Kentucky]].

This tree usually occurs as widely dispersed individuals or small  colonial groups with interconnected root systems. This tree is found in floodplains and river valleys but is also sometimes seen on rocky hillsides and limestone woods. In the northeastern part of its range, seemingly natural groves of this tree are actually associated with known prehistoric village sites.

The Kentucky Coffeetree has immense bipinnate [[leaf|leaves]], 60-90 cm in length, and about 2/3 as broad. The leaves emerge later in the spring than those of most other [[deciduous]] trees, and fall earlier in the autumn. This peculiar characteristic, coupled with the fact that the large leaves mean few twigs in the winter profile, make it a tree that is ideal for urban shading where winter sunlight is to be maximized (such as in proximity to [[renewable energy|solar]] hot-air systems). This tree is bothered little by heat, cold, drought, insects, disease, road salt, ice, and alkaline soil.

It forms large [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]], reproducing by shoots sprouting from roots. The bark is ash-gray and scaly, flaking similarly to [[black cherry]], but more so. The [[flower]]s are [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], and the [[fruit]] is a hard-shelled bean in heavy, woody, thick-walled pods filled with sweet, thick, gooey pulp. The shape of the pods varies somewhat: pod length ranges from ca. 12.7cm to 25.4cm; unfertilized female trees may bear miniature seedless pods. The beans contain the [[toxin]] cytisine. 

Kentucky Coffeetree is easy to grow from seed. Filing the seedcoat by hand with a small file, and then soaking the seeds in water for 24 hours will ensure rapid germination. [[plant propagation|Propagation]] is also easy from dormant [[root cuttings]].

The common name "coffeetree" derives from the use of the roasted seeds as a substitute for [[coffee]] in times of poverty. They are a very inferior substitute for real coffee, and caution should be used in trying them as they are poisonous in large quantities. 

It is one of three species in the genus ''Gymnocladus'', the other two being native to eastern [[Asia]]. These are '''Chinese Coffeetree''' ''Gymnocladus chinensis'' in central China, and '''Burmese Coffeetree''' ''Gymnocladus burmanicus'' in [[Myanmar]].

The name is sometimes hyphenated as 'coffee-tree'; the form 'coffeetree' used here is as used officially by the [[United States Forest Service]].
