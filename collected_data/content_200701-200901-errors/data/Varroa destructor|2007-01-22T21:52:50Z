'''''Varroa destructor''''' is an external parasitic [[mite]] that attacks [[honey bee]]s ''[[Apis cerana]]'' and ''[[Apis mellifera]]''.  It was until recently mislabeled as ''[[Varroa jacobsoni]]''.

''Varroa'' mites have been found on flower feeding insects such as the [[bumblebee]] ''[[Bombus pennsylvanicus]]'', the [[scarab beetle]] ''[[Phanaeus vindex]]'' and  the [[flower-fly]] ''[[Palpada vinetorum]]'' (Kevan ''et al.'' 1990). Although the ''Varroa'' mite cannot reproduce on other insects, its presence on them may be a means by which it spreads short distances ([[phoresy]]).

''Varroa'' can only replicate in a honey bee colony. It attaches at the body of the bee and weakens the bee by sucking [[open circulatory system|haemolymph]]. In this process the mite may also spread [[RNA virus|RNA viral]] agents to the bee. A significant mite infestation will lead to the death of a honey bee colony, usually in the late fall through early spring. The ''Varroa'' mite has been the parasite with the most pronounced economic impact on the [[beekeeping]] industry.

==Origin==

''Varroa destructor'' was until recently thought to be a closely related mite species called ''[[Varroa jacobsoni]]''{{ref|}} {{ref|}} {{ref|}}. Both species parasitize the Asian honey bee, ''[[Apis cerana]]''. The mite species originally described as ''V. jacobsoni'' by [[Anthonid Cornelis Oudemans|Oudemans]] in 1904 is part of the same species complex, but not the same species that made the jump to ''Apis mellifera''. That jump probably first took place in the [[Philippines]] in the early 1960â€™s. Only after ''Apis mellifera'' were imported to the Philippines, it came into close contact with ''Apis cerana'', where ''Varroa'' then also became a parasite of ''Apis mellifera''.  Up until 2000, scientists did not positively identify ''Varroa destructor'' as a separate species. In 2005, we know that the only ''Varroa'' mites that can reproduce in colonies of ''Apis mellifera'' ([[Western honeybee]]) are the Korea and Japan/Thailand genotypes of ''Varroa destructor''. ''Varroa jacobsoni'' is a fairly benign parasite of ''Apis cerana''. This late identification in 2000 by Anderson and Trueman led to some confusion and mislabeling in the scientific literature.

==Life cycle==
The female mite enters a honey bee brood cell. As soon as the cell is capped, the mite lays eggs. The young mites hatch in about the same time as the young bee develops and leave the cell with the [[host (biology)|host]]. The [http://www.alp.admin.ch/themen/00502/00515/index.html?lang=en Swiss Bee Research Centre] scientifically investigated the life cycle of the varroa in the capped cell and described it in a paper [http://www.alp.admin.ch/themen/00502/00515/index.html?lang=en&download=M3wBUQCu/8ulmKDu36WenojQ1NTTjaXZnqWfVp3Uhmfhnapmmc7Zi6rZnqCkkIN0f3+AbKbXrZ2lhtTN34al3p6YrY7P1oah162apo3X1cjYh2+hoJVn6w==  (A Look under the cap)].

The model for the [[population dynamics]] is that there is [[exponential growth]] when bee brood is available and exponential decline when no brood is available. High mite populations in the fall can cause a crisis when drone rearing ceases and the mites switch to worker larvae, causing a quick population crash and often hive death.

==Reproduction==
Mites reproduce on a 10-day cycle. In 12 weeks the number of mites in a [[Western honey bee]] hive can roughly multiply by 12. [[Russian honey bee]]s are one third to one half less susceptible to mite reproduction [http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc98/8_8_98/fob1.htm].

==Varroatosis==

The [[parasitic disease]] caused by varroa mites is called '''varroatosis'''.

Its treatment has been of limited success. First the bees were medicated with fluvinate which had about 95% mite falls.  It was a good product, but the last five percent became resistant to it and later, almost immune. Fluvinate was followed by coumophose, an active ingredient in VX nerve gas. ''[[Apis cerana]]'' has developed a tolerance to these [[parasite]]s  and has learned to thrive with them.

The European ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' bees are almost completely defenseless against these parasites, with the exception of the Russian Honey Bee. What makes ''Varroa'' mites so bad for beekeeping is the way which they survive.  The adults suck the "blood" of adult honey bees for sustenance and reproduce on the honey bee larvae.  The adult honey bees are at this point, due to their open wounds, more prone to [[BPV]] and [[DWV]].  The ''Varroa'' mite reproduces inside a cell with a honey bee larva, entering the cell just before it is sealed and the larva pupates.  The mite preferentailly infests drone cells.  The ''Varroa'' mite lays eggs on the larva which hatch into females and finally lays one male.  When the young bee emerges from the cell after pupation the ''Varroa'' mites also leave and spread to other bees and larvae.

==Control methods in beehive==
'''Synthetic chemicals'''
*[[pyrethroid]] [[insecticide]] (Apistan) as strips
*[[organophosphate]] insecticide (Coumaphos (Check-mite)) as strips
'''Natural occurring chemicals'''
*[[ester|sugar esters]] (Sucrocide) in spray application
*[[oxalic acid]] trickling method or applied as vapor (Dany's BienenWohl or  [http://www.biovet.ch/shop/global/product_info.php?info=p2_VARROX%AE-Vaporiser.html VARROX-Vaporiser])
*[[formic acid]] as vapor or pads
*Foodgrade mineral oil as vapor and in direct application on paper or cords.
*[http://www.apis.admin.ch/en/krankheiten/oele.php Essential oil] especially lemon, mint, and [http://www.apis.admin.ch/en/krankheiten/thymol.php thyme oil]
'''Physical'''
*Screened bottom board with sticky board is a purely physical method.  It separates mites that fall through the screen and the sticky board prevents them from crawling back up.
*Dusting with powdered sugar (Dowda Method)
*freezing or heating of capped drone brood method
'''Behavioral'''
*Swarming or queen-arrest method.  By interrupting the honey bee brood cycle, mites reproduction is also blocked.
*Hygienic Behavior.  Hygienic behavior is biological behavior with genetic traits that can be breed into bees.  This behavior causes bees to smell infected brood and remove them before the infestation spreads further.  http://www.sare.org/publications/factsheet/0305_01.htm

== Preventive measures and treatment ==
''Varroa'' mites can be treated with commercially-available [[miticide]]s.
Miticides must be applied strictly according to the label in order to minimize the contamination of [[honey]] that might be consumed by humans.
Proper use of miticides will also help to slow the development of resistance among the mites.

''Varroa'' mites can also be controlled through non-chemical means.  Most of these controls are intended to reduce the mite population to a manageable level, not to eliminate the mites completely.
* Many beekeepers use a '''screened bottom board''' on their hives. When mites occasionally fall off a bee, they must climb back up to parasitize a new bee. If the beehive has a screened floor with mesh the right size, the mite will fall through and can not return to the beehive. The screened bottom board is also being credited with increased circulation of air which reduces condensation in a hive during the winter. (Studies at [[Cornell University]] done over several years found that screened bottoms have no measurable effect at all.  [http://www.masterbeekeeper.org/pdf/ne2.pdf Northeast Beekeeper] Vol 1 #1 Jan 2004)

* '''Powdered sugar''' (Dowda Method), talc or other "safe" powders with a grain size between 5 and 15 micrometres can be sprinkled on the bees. The powder does not harm the bees (and, if you use sugar, can even become a small source of feed), but does interfere with the mite's ability to maintain its hold on the bee.    It is also believed to increase the bees' grooming behavior.  This causes a certain percentage of mites to become dislodged.  Powdered sugar works best as an amplifier of the effects of a screened bottom board.
* '''Freezing drone brood''' takes advantage of ''Varroa'' mites' preference for longer living [[drone (bee)|drone]] brood. The beekeeper will put a frame in the hive that is sized to encourage the queen to lay primarily drone brood. Once the brood is capped, the beekeeper removes the frame and puts it in the freezer. This kills the ''Varroa'' mites that are parasitizing those bees. It also kills the drone brood, but most hives produce an excess of drone bees so it is not generally considered a loss. After freezing, the frame can be returned to the hive. The nurse bees will clean out the dead brood (and dead mites) and the cycle continues.
** '''Drone brood excision''' is a variation applicable to [[top bar hive]]s.  Honey bees tend to place comb suitable for drone brood along the bottom and outer margins of the comb. Cutting this off at a late stage of development ("purple eye stage") and discarding it reduces the mite load on the colony.  It also allows for inspection and counting of varroa on the brood.
* '''Small cell''' foundation (4.9 mm across - about 0.5 mm smaller than standard) is believed to limit the space in each cell that ''Varroa'' mites have in which to inhabit and also to enhance the difference in size between worker and drone brood with the intention of making the drone comb traps more effective in trapping ''Varroa'' mites.  Small cell foundation has staunch advocates though controlled studies have been generally inconclusive.
* The '''Konya''' revolving or rotating hive design is a patented invention of [http://www.beekeeping.com/articles/us/rotating_broodnest.htm Lajos Konya], a beekeeper in Otteveny, Hungary.  The hive has a cylindrical brood chamber, circular frames and an apparatus to rotate the frames according to a specific schedule.  The rotation is believed to disrupt the ''Varroa'' mite reproduction cycle with this rotation thereby reducing [[fecundity]] of the parasite.

Several attempts have been made (and are continuing) to breed bees with an increased "resistance" to ''Varroa'' mites.  In fact, the [[Africanized honey bee]] was originally an experiment to [[hybrid|cross-breed]] mite resistance into the [[Western honey bee|European honey bee]]s common in the Americas.
