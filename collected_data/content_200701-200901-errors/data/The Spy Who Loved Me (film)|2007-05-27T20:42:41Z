'''''The Spy Who Loved Me''''' is the 10th [[film]] in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]] and the third to star [[Roger Moore]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. The film takes its title from the tenth novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series. It is the first Bond film to be written with a wholly original plot line in its screenplay, as [[Ian Fleming]]'s estate only gave permission for the title to be used. The film was subsequently novelised in 1977 by its screenwriter [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] in [[#Novelisation|''James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me'']]. The film involves a reclusive megolomaniac named Stromberg who plans to destroy civilisation and create a new world under the sea.  Bond teams up with a Russian agent codenamed "XXX" to stop Stromberg.

Released between [[1977 in film|July and December]] [[1977]] variously worldwide, it is the second Bond film to be directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]]. Gilbert previously directed ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967) and would later direct ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979). The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] and also received [[Golden Globe]] nominations.

With pre-production under way during the world wide release of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' in December of 1974, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' marks the first film in the series not to be co-produced by [[Harry Saltzman]], who had reluctantly come to sell his shares of his beloved Bond franchise rights of [[Danjaq, LLC]] and [[EON Productions]] to [[United Artists]] 

==Production==
''The Spy Who Loved Me'' in many ways was a make or break film for the Bond franchise and was plagued since its conception by many problems. The first was the departure of Bond producer [[Harry Saltzman]] who was forced to sell his half of the Bond film franchise in 1975 for twenty million Pounds. Saltzman had branched out into several other ventures of dubious promise and consequently was struggling through personal financial reversals unrelated to Bond and exacerbated by the twin personal tragedies of experiencing both the onset of the lingering cancer in his terminally ill spouse (who Roger Moore recalls passing during the filming phase of this film's production cycle) and many of the symptoms of clinical depression<!--Per Documentary: "Harry Saltzman SHOWMAN", p/o special edition of From Russia with Love DVD. Includes bald statements by his friends as well as children Steven and Hilary.--> in himself as related in the MGM television documentary 'Harry Saltzman SHOWMAN'.

A second problem was finding a director. The producers approached [[Steven Spielberg]] who was in post production of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' but ultimately decided to wait to see 'how the fish picture turns out'. The first director attached to the film was [[Guy Hamilton]] who directed the previous three Bond films as well as ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' but left after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. EON Productions would later turn to [[Lewis Gilbert]] who had directed the earlier Bond film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.
[[Image:Stromberg.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Curd Jurgens]] as [[Karl Stromberg]]]]
With a director finally secured, the next hurdle was finishing the script which had gone through several rewrites by numerous writers. Additionally the initial villain of the film was [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]; however [[Kevin McClory]] who owns the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' forced an [[injunction]] on EON Productions delaying the film further. The villain would later be changed from Blofeld to [[Karl Stromberg]] so that the injunction could be lifted. [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] was later brought in by Lewis Gilbert to complete the script. Although Fleming had requested no elements from his original book be used, the novel features a thug named Sol Horror who is described as having steel capped teeth. This character would be the basis for [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]], although having steel capped teeth is where the similarity between Horror and Jaws ends.

Regardless of all the problems throughout production of the film, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was a financial and box office success, raking in $185,400,000 worldwide on a production budget of $14 million. At the time it was the highest grossing Bond film ever.

===Script===
Broccoli commissioned a number of writers to work on fashioning the script into something suitable, among them Stirling Silliphant, John Landis, Ronald Hardy, [[Anthony Burgess]], and Derek Marlowe. In the second volume of his autobiography, [[Anthony Burgess]] claims to have worked on an early treatment for the movie. Eventually it would fall once again to [[Richard Maibaum]] to build the framework for the film and at first he tried to incorporate ideas from all of the other writers into his script. This proved just too cumbersome though it has been suggested that some of the other writers' work does survive through to the finished film - the submarine silo for example is said to have come from Anthony Burgess.

Maibaum's original pass at ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' featured an alliance of international terrorists storming SPECTRE's headquarters and deposing Blofeld before trying to destroy the world for themselves to make way for a New World Order. Broccoli quickly stomped on this first draft, dismissing it as too political, and it was back to the drawing board for Maibaum.

Meanwhile Guy Hamilton who had overseen the previous three Bond films (none of which had done as well as his debut in the series ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964]) and who was originally pencilled in to direct ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', decided he wanted instead to be free to direct for the Salkinds who were preparing their epic ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'' (1978).

This left the way open for Lewis Gilbert to return to the fold almost a decade after his success with ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967). When he read Maibaum's script he recommended Broccoli bring in another writer ([[Christopher Wood]]) to have a go at polishing it but keeping both the notion of a super tanker that swallowed up other ships and the new villain Jaws, the assassin with the steel teeth.

Wood's proposed changes to Maibaum's draft script were agreed by Broccoli but before he could set to work there were more legal complications. In the years since ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965) [[Kevin McClory]] had set up two film companies and collaborating with [[Sean Connery]] and novelist [[Len Deighton]] had been trying to get a new Bond film off the ground. McClory got wind of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film ''Thunderball'', back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s.

McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for alleged copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole rights to use [[SPECTRE]] and its agents, including Blofeld. Not wishing to get into what could have been a lengthy legal battle that could have delayed production on ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', Broccoli ordered Wood to take out any references to SPECTRE in his script.

For the part of Russian agent Anya Amasova, Broccoli had originally wanted former model [[Lois Chiles]] but enquiries to her agent revealed that Chiles was supposedly in temporary retirement and was taking acting lessons in New York. Instead the part went to former model Barbara Bach, the future Mrs [[Ringo Starr]].

With [[Ken Adam]] back on board and with a much larger budget than of late, it was inevitable audiences were going to get a Bond on a grand scale. So grand in fact that Bond's traditional home at [[Pinewood Studios]] simply didn't have anywhere near enough room to house Adam's latest extravagance, the interior of Stromberg's massive supertanker.

===The Set===
[[Image:Mount Asgard 3 2001-07-25.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Location of the ski jump in [[Baffin Island]] [[Canada]]]]
In March 1976 construction began of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the enormous 007 Stage. To complement this 374 x 160 x 53 foot tall monstrosity, EON also paid for the building of the largest water tank in the industry, capable of taking some 1,200,000 gallons. At a time when Britain was gripped by a severe drought and concomitant water shortages, this was seen by some as an unnecessary extravagance, although EON maintained the water they used was taken from a natural well buried beneath the stage.

While construction on the massive Liparus set continued, the second unit headed by [[John Glen]] set off for [[Asgard Peak]] in [[Baffin Island]] Canada where in July 1976 they staged the film's much loved pre-credits sequence - Bond's audacious escape from his pursuers by skiing off a cliff edge and sailing to freedom beneath a [[Union Flag|Union Jack]] parachute. Bond film veteran Willy Bogner was on hand again to capture the action staged by stunt man Rick Sylvester who earned a deserved $30,000 for the highly dangerous stunt.

The main unit began its work in [[August]] [[1976]], travelling first to [[Sardinia]] and later to [[Egypt]] for some of the film's key early scenes. While in Sardinia, Moore got to drive the first of two [[Lotus Esprit]]s that were to feature in the film. The second specially modified model [nicknamed 'Wet Nellie'] was unveiled by Ken Adam and Derek Meddings in October when the second unit, this time supervised by Michael G Wilson, travelled to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] to film the many underwater sequences.

Back in Egypt the crew visited Cairo's spice market, the Gyer-Anderson museum and of course the Giza pyramids. However the crew were caught in a food shortage during the shoot, requiring Broccoli himself to step in and save the day by cooking [[spaghetti]] for his hungry 100 strong cast and crew.

The production returned briefly to the UK to shoot at the Faslane submarine base before setting off to Spain, Portugal and the Bay of Biscay where the super tanker exteriors were filmed. On 5 December 1976, with principal photography finished, the massive 007 Stage was formally opened by Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] at a star-studded ceremony.

==Plot==
[[Image:Anya Amasova played by Barbara Bach.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Anya Amasova]] (Agent Triple X) â [[Barbara Bach]]]]
[[Ballistic Missile Submarine|Ballistic missile submarines]] from the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fleet are stolen by the [[List of James Bond villains|villain]], [[Karl Stromberg]], in an attempt to launch their [[nuclear weapons]] at targets around the globe. James Bond teams up with Major [[Anya Amasova]] (a.k.a. Agent Triple X), a dedicated agent from the Soviet Union, to find out what happened and prevent a possible [[World War III]].
[[Image:007Jaws.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Richard Kiel]] as [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]]]]
The film begins in [[Austria]], where Bond escapes an ambush by Soviet agents, killing one of them in a [[Alpine skiing|downhill ski]] race that concludes in an all-time iconic Bond film moment: when Bond skis off a vast cliff and fallsâ¦  only to open a [[Union Jack]] [[parachute]] (the film was released in [[Great Britain]]'s [[Silver Jubilee]] year). On reporting back to base, Bond learns that someone is trying to sell the plans of a highly advanced [[submarine]] tracking system to the highest bidder. Bond then travels to [[Egypt]], where he is supposed to contact the prospective seller near the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]. Here he first encounters the beautiful Major Anya Amasova, who becomes a rival in his search for the plans, and later a partner in a somewhat uneasy truce (supported by their respective superiors) when they realise that the person behind the theft of the plans (Karl Stromberg, who is a [[shipping]] tycoon) is also responsible for the disappearance of the submarines.

The duo decides to travel to Stromberg's base in [[Sardinia]]. In a [[train]] on the way there, Bond saves Amasova's life as she is attacked by [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]]. Shortly after their arrival in Sardinia, Amasova learns about Bond's killing of the Soviet agent in Austria, who the audience already knows was her lover. She tells Bond she will complete the mission with him, but vows that after she has fulfilled her duty, she will kill 007 in revenge. Posing as a [[oceanography|marine biologist]] and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover that he has a mysterious new [[supertanker]], the ''Liparus''. After they leave the base, Jaws and others, including a helicopter pilot called Naomi ([[Caroline Munro]]), attempt repeatedly to kill them, but all attempts fails due to Bond's driving skills and fact that his car â a [[Lotus Esprit]] from [[Q Branch]] â can convert into a [[submarine]]. 

With this, they examine Stromberg's Atlantis base and confirm that he is operating the tracking system. The [[United States Navy]] submarine in which they then attempt to pursue the ''Liparus'' is, like the other subs, captured by the modified supertanker, and Stromberg begins to set his plan in motion. The plan is to launch nuclear missiles from the submarines he captured, the targets being Moscow and New York City. This will start World War III, which Stromberg will wait out in his underwater city, establishing a new civilisation. 
[[Image:Strongberglair.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stromberg's lair]]
However, a huge battle within the ''Liparus'' between its crew and those captured from the subs culminates in escape and a race to destroy Atlantis. Bond is able to get the British and Soviet submarines to destroy each other first, saving Moscow and New York, but then insists on a final confrontation with Stromberg and the rescue of Amasova, after whom the villain is now lusting; Bond shoots Stromberg and, after a final fight with Jaws, the two spies depart his base just before it is destroyed. As they await rescue in a small [[escape pod]], Bond finds a bottle of champagne and suggests they have a drink. Amasova reminds Bond that she has vowed to kill him and draws her gun, but instead of shooting him, she smiles when the top pops off the champagne bottle, making a for-once visibly shaken Bond jump. He asks for a last request, which Amasova then grants: he suggests they get out of their wet clothes. Amasova finally forgives him and the two embrace passionately. Their respective bosses are subsequently horrified to find them in a compromising positionâ¦

"Just trying to keep the British end up, Sir." Bond quips before pulling the shade.

The film is best known for Bond's Lotus Esprit submarine/car and the introduction of [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]], a giant and seemingly indestructible [[assassin]] with steel teeth. Jaws, played by [[Richard Kiel]], does not speak and is the only henchman of the James Bond villains privileged to appear in more than one film. He later appeared in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (in which he has one line). Previously, Kiel had played a similar character in the action comedy ''[[Silver Streak (1976 film)|Silver Streak]]'' starring [[Gene Wilder]] and [[Richard Pryor]].

This is one of the only Bond films in which it is possible to ascertain a rough calendar date for the events shown; at one point an appointment diary page is shown on screen, indicating that a contact's meeting with arms dealer Max Kalba is scheduled for Wednesday, August 3. Although no year is shown, August 3 did fall on a Wednesday during 1977, the year of the film's release.

==Vehicles and gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}
[[Image:Lotus spy.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Lotus Esprit]] Wet Nelly, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'']]
*[[Lotus Esprit]] â Including all of the usual Q refinements, this car was equipped with [[surface to air missile]]s. The main feature of the car however was the ability to transform into a submarine. Once transformed it could unleash depth charges and smoke screens. The car was nicknamed ''Wet Nellie'', a reference to the autogyro provided by Q for Bond's use in ''You Only Live Twice''. Within the second unit production team, it was also known as ''Margie Nixon''. There were three vehicles used for the special effect â a waterproofed Esprit able to drive into the water without excessive damage to engine or occupants (for scenes driving onto the beach, and escaping from the helicopter by diving into the water, though there is contention that the scene in question was filmed by sacrificing an Esprit for the shot); a second vehicle which could only transform from car to submarine â technical critics will see that the vehicle was extremely uni-functional, despite being very well built; and ''Margie Nixon'', the [[wet sub]]marine whose body was constructed from an Esprit donor car.
*[[Wetbike]] â a [[hydrofoil]] "water motorcycle" used by Bond to travel from the U.S. Submarine to Stromberg's Atlantis to save Triple X.  Built by a subsidiary of [[Minnesota]]-based Arctic Enterprises.
*XXX's Cigarette â The cigarette used by Triple X contained knock-out powder.
*[[Seiko]] Quartz watch â Basically working like a pager, it had a built-in telex that allowed MI6 to send important messages to Bond, printing them out like a miniature [[teletype]]. (It actually looked more like a [[label-maker]] tape.)
*[[Ski pole]] gun â Was used to fire a projectile at pursuers. Bond uses it to kill Triple X's lover while escaping from him in the pre-credits sequence.
*[[Microfilm]] viewer disguised as a cigarette case and lighter.  Bond uses it to examine the microfilm (in the film - the microfilm container has the [[Minolta]] logo) of the submarine tracking system.

[[Robert Brown (actor)|Robert Brown]] also has a smaller role in ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' as Admiral Hargreaves. Brown would go on to replace Bernard Lee as M in ''[[Octopussy]]''. It has never been established as to whether Brown was supposed to be still playing Lee's character, a promoted Hargreaves, or someone else.

[[Walter Gotell]] makes his first appearance as General Gogol of the KGB. Gogol would appear in all future Roger Moore Bond films and would make his final appearance in [[Timothy Dalton]]'s ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. While this was his first appearance as Gogol, this is Gotell's second appearance in a James Bond film. His first was in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' where he played the villain Morzeny.

[[Shane Rimmer]] continues his tradition of making an appearance in a James Bond film, this time starring as Commander Carter of the USS ''Wayne'', the submarine that brought Bond inside the supertanker, as well as helped lead the resistance against Stromberg.

[[Jeremy Bulloch]] also makes an appearance as a British sailor who fights back against Stromberg's forces. He would appear in later Bond movies as Q's assistant, Smithers. He is best known for wearing the [[Boba Fett]] costume (although his voice was overdubbed in post-production) in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.

==Reception==
''The Spy Who Loved Me'' opened with a Royal Premiere, attended by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], at the Odeon [[Leicester Square]] in London on 13 July 1977. The subsequent premiere party was hosted by Broccoli at the Intercontinental Hotel in Park Lane and itself cost Â£143,000. Over dinner, Broccoli raised the potentially tricky topic of Moore's commitment to the series. Moore's original contract with Eon had tied him to only three films, all of which had now been made. But Broccoli need have had no worries â Moore was only too keen to keep playing Bond and readily agreed to appear in the next film, which Broccoli was already planning to be ''For Your Eyes Only''.

==Novelisation==
{{splitsection|James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me}}
[[Image:SpyWhoLovedMeMovieNovel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|1977 Triad/Panther British paperback edition]]
When Ian Fleming sold the film rights to the James Bond novels to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, he only gave permission for the title ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' to be used. Since the screenplay for the film had nothing to do with Fleming's original novel, [[Glidrose Publications]], for the first time, authorised that a [[novelization|novelisation]] be written based upon the script. This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since ''[[Colonel Sun]]'' nearly a decade earlier. [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], who co-authored the screenplay with [[Richard Maibaum]], was commissioned to write the book, which was given the title ''James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me''. Wood would also novelise the screenplay for the next Bond film, ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' in 1979.

The novelisation and the screenplay, although both written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the novelisation [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] is still active and still after James Bond. Their part in the novelisation begins during the "pre-title credits" sequence in which Bond is escaping from a cabin on the top of Aiguille du Mort, a mountain near the town of [[Chamonix]]. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for the whereabouts of the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts with a number of Bond stories, including the film ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]), in which a character remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH is mentioned to have been put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelization include the Bond girl Anya Amasova and her lover Sergei Borzov as well as Colonel-General Niktin, a character from Fleming's novel ''[[From Russia with Love]]'' who has since become the head of SMERSH.

Other differences include the villain, [[Karl Stromberg]], being renamed as Sigmund Stromberg. The change of Stromberg's given name as well as the existence of SMERSH may be in some way due to the [[Thunderball (novel)#The controversy over the novel|controversy over ''Thunderball'']], in which [[Kevin McClory]] was made aware of certain plot points of the film ''The Spy Who Loved Me''. At one point the villain of the film was to be [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and his organization [[SPECTRE]]; however, this was changed to avoid a possible lawsuit over the rights to this character, which originated from the novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.
