"'''The World Is Not Enough'''" was the [[theme music|theme tune]] to the 19th [[James Bond]] movie, ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' and performed by rock group [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]. The [[EON Productions]] movie (distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]) and accompanying [[soundtrack]] [[album]] and theme song were released by [[Radioactive Records]] and [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] (both part of Universal Music Group) during the final months of Garbage's successful world tour in support of their [[Music recording sales certification|platinum certified]] second album ''[[Version 2.0]]''.  

"The World Is Not Enough" was written by [[Tony Award|Tony]], [[Grammy]] and [[Academy award]] winning long-time [[James Bond music|Bond theme]] [[lyricist]] [[Don Black]] and by Grammy, [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI Film Music award]] winning<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/200005/20000516a.asp/|title="BMI Honors Top Film and TV Composers"|publisher=''BMI.com''|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> [[composer]] [[David Arnold]], who composed the score to the previous Bond installment [[1997]]'s ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''. The song was written in the classic Bond style with conflicting and contrasting ambiguous and sexual lyrics. The line ''"There's no point in living if you can't feel the life"'', an important [[plot point]] in the film, is included in the track as it appears on other media, but is cut from the credits sequence. This is the third Bond theme sung by a [[Scottish people|Scotswoman]] ([[Shirley Manson]]), after [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu's]] "[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)#Soundtrack|The Man with the Golden Gun]]" and [[Sheena Easton]]'s "[[For Your Eyes Only (1981 song)|For Your Eyes Only]]".

"The World Is Not Enough" is due to appear on Garbage's forthcoming [[greatest hits]] compilation ''[[Absolute Garbage]]'', due for release in [[July 23]]/[[July 24|24]], [[2007]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direct-current.net/#newsStory1800|title="Direct current news"|publisher=''Direct-current.net''|accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref>

==Creating the Bond theme== 

"The World Is Not Enough" was written by Don Black and David Arnold during Winter 1998, recorded and mixed by Garbage and David Arnold in [[London]] and [[Vancouver]], during breaks in Garbage's 1999 European tour. For unspecified reasons the song was not allowed to be written in any studios based in [[USA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=68/|title="Road Report 11 For '99"|publisher=''Garbage.com''|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> The song was recorded, mixed and mastered by [[August 23]], 1999.<ref>"The World Is Not Enough - Classic Sound CD-R" (accessed [[February 9]], [[2007]])</ref> Don Black also wrote the lyrics to three other James Bond themes: [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]'s "[[Thunderball (soundtrack)|Thunderball]]", [[Shirley Bassey]]'s "[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)#Soundtrack|Diamonds Are Forever]]"  and Lulu's "The Man With The Golden Gun".<ref>{{imdb name|id=0085246|name=Don Black}}</ref> He also wrote [[K.D. Lang|k.d. lang]]'s end title theme tune "Surrender" from ''Tomorrow Never Dies''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/tomorrow_never.html|title=Filmtracks: Tomorrow Never Dies, David Arnold|accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref> and [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]]'s ''The World Is Not Enough'' original end theme "Only Myself To Blame" (Arnold also co-wrote these two). Arnold had already composed the scores to ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', ''The World Is Not Enough'', and would later return for ''[[Die Another Day]]'' and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'',<ref>{{imdb name|id=0003417|name=David Arnold}}</ref> in which he also co-wrote [[Chris Cornell]]'s theme "[[You Know My Name]]".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/07-26-2006/0004404210&EDATE= | title=Chris Cornell Has Written and Will Perform the Main Title Song for CASINO ROYALE | date = [[2006-07-26]]| accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref>

In September 1998, Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, producers of the James Bond [[media franchise|movie franchise]] and principals of EON Productions, selected David Arnold as the composer for the upcoming nineteenth Bond movie, due for release the following year. Arnold and Black met several times in November and December 1998 to discuss the lyrics for "The World Is Not Enough", and they exchanged phone calls, faxes and e-mails during that time in collaborating on the song. According to Arnold, he "strung some la-la’s together, and all of a sudden the [song] came to life, and [he] thought [that was] probably it." By the end of the year, the songwriters had completed both the song and lyrics, save for the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]- a brief section in the middle of the song.<ref name="findlaw">{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=6th&navby=case&no=04a0256p/| title="Fogerty & Crow vs. MGM/Universal/Eon Productions"|publisher=''FindLaw.com''|access-date=2006-09-24}}</ref> 

The movie's [[Film producer|production team]] were keen for the song to be written as early as possible, with a view to using elements of the melody within the main score of the film. [[Film director|Director]] [[Michael Apted]] spoke about his involvement with the theme tune on his ''The World Is Not Enough'' DVD commentary "I made it clear to [Arnold] the sort of tone I needed for the song. We wanted something romantic and haunting. I was insistent that we got a rough draft of the song out soon enough so that it could be incorporated into the score. I remembered how effective that was in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''; they were able to use the song, "[[Nobody Does It Better]]", as a love theme throughout the film."<ref>{{cite video

Arnold was quoted on ''The World Is Not Enough'' [[DVD commentary]] speaking about the challenge of creating a Bond theme tune - this movie's tune would be his first (although he had previously co-composed [[k.d. lang]]'s theme for ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', which was ended up as the end title theme, in favour of [[Sheryl Crow]]'s own theme). "It's like a [[chalice (cup)|poisoned chalice]] [doing the theme], it's one of those things where people say it sounds too much like a James Bond song, or not enough like a James Bond song. I wanted a classic Bond sound but wanted it to feel like it belonged to the rest of the film and the rest of the score.<ref name="comment2">{{cite video

By the beginning of [[January 1999]], Arnold had completed the basic outline for the song and created a [[Demo (music)|demo]] recording of it at his private [[recording studio]]. He played the track to Wilson, Broccoli and Apted, who were "extremely pleased with [the song]". MGM however, were disappointed with the song initially because it was a [[ballad]] and they had hoped for a theme song with a different [[tempo]]. It was not the end of troubles the team had with MGM - the company contacted Arnold in [[March 1999]] and claimed that a "three-[[note]] [[Motif (music)|motif]]" in "The World Is Not Enough" was too similar to a motif in a number of earlier Bond theme songs. Arnold agreed to remove the [[Sequence (music)|sequence]].<ref name="findlaw"/>

Arnold initially met with Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson in London in January 1999,<ref name="findlaw"/> and called her up a week later and formally offered Garbage the opportunity to perform the next Bond single. Arnold sent the band "The World Is Not Enough" demo to them on the morning of their sold-out [[January 20]] show at London's [[Wembley Arena]]. On ''The World Is Not Enough'' DVD commentary, Arnold expressed his desire for them to take part. "Part of the reason I thought Garbage would be such a good idea [for the theme song], is that I think Shirley Manson is someone who could easily inhabit Bond's world. The whole thing about the song is that it needs to entice you, and beckon you in. I've always thought this title song is from [[Elektra King|Elektra]]'s point of view and it should be like a steel fist in a velvet glove. It beckons you with a little crooked finger saying 'come on, come on, come on' and when it gets you it strangles you and stabs you in the back. Shirley is the only person I can think of in the world of contemporary music who is the musical equivalent of Elektra. It is as important as casting the characters - getting the right voice and right attitude for the song."<ref name="comment2"/>

"About a week after [our meeting] we got asked if we'd be interested in recording the theme", Manson told [[Canadian Online Explorer|Jam! Music]], "I don't know whether David had us in mind or whether when he met me in London thought, 'Hmmm, maybe they'd be good for the theme that I'm working on.' I don't know quite how these things work, but the stars were aligned."<ref name="jam">{{cite web|url= http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/G/Garbage/1999/11/05/745309.html/|title="Garbage tackles Bond legacy"|publisher=''JAM! Music''|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref> To quell legal issues regarding Manson's label status (she remains signed to UMG's Radioactive Records under a [[1993]] six-album [[record deal]], while in 1999 the band were signed to [[independent record label]]s [[A&E Records|Mushroom Records UK]] worldwide /[[Almo Sounds]] for North America) the song was licensed to Radioactive Records to quell any contractual difficulty. Arnold was pleased at Garbage's reaction to being asked to do the theme: "I actually haven't heard anyone scream down the phone before. Never come across a more enthusiastic response to a 'do-you-wanna-do-this?' question."<ref name="cocktail">{{cite video|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0918495/|title="Bond Cocktail" - Music''|medium=TV|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>

"David sent us a rough demo with just the [[synthesizer]] playing the string mockup and after Don entered some lyrics. And we really loved it." Butch Vig told Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.<ref name="kiss">{{cite web|url=http://www.garbage.suite.dk/articles/mkkbb/index.html|title=''"MKKBB talks with Butch Vig''|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>Initially, MGM had resisted composer David Arnold's suggestion to work with Garbage on the theme, they had wanted an artist a more mainstream profile, but Arnold convinced them that the group would bring a certain credibility and commercial clout to the Bond theme stable. Eventually the company relented, and the producers and the band reached a deal after a few weeks of negotiation.

The next problem was when to record and produce the song - Garbage were in the middle of a lengthy European [[concert tour]]. The band ended up jetting from shows to recording studios and then back out on to play their following scheduled concerts. A Garbage concert in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on [[July 18]], [[1999]] was rescheduled to end earlier so that Garbage would have time to jet to Metropolis Studios in London, UK to record their parts with Arnold's 60-piece [[orchestra]], and then fly out to [[Six-Fours-les-Plages]], [[France]] the following day to resume their touring commitments. Re-writes and production took place via lengthy phone calls and e-mails, but the bulk of it was recorded over a week in August 1999 at Armoury Studios in Vancouver, Canada. Manson requested one lyrical change in the song because the line ''"I know when to kiss and I know when to kill"'' did not meet her tastes. Arnold and Black changed the lyrics for her, taking the lyric from a [[first person narrative]] to [[second person narrative]] (The song was finished with the lyric ''"We know when to kiss and we know when to kill").<ref name="findlaw"/>

Butch recalled to MKBB "It was a lot different for us because for one thing it was the first time we were working with a 60-piece orchestra and we wanted to make sure we had after hearing the song that we had the right [[Key (music)|key]], right tempo. It was difficult - we were on tour so we sort of went back and forth with David on the telephone. We'd be in a hotel room in [[Germany]] playing stuff… We'd set up a portable studio and then play stuff over the phone and he'd play things back to us. You know, very crude but it worked enough for us to bang out the [[arrangement]] cause we had to fly to London to record the basic tracks, but we wanted to have the strings done so Shirley could sing to the string track. That primarily carries a lot of the song."<ref name="kiss"/>

"David did the strings in a day and we just flew in for one day and cut the basic tracks - throw in some bass, some guitar and vocals. The tour continued in Europe for about another three and a half weeks. Then we flew up to Vancouver where we took the track and "Garbage-ized" it. We were basically cutting and pasting things and adding and subtracting and recorded and mixed it there." Butch continued to MKKBB.<ref name="kiss"/>

David Arnold, during an interview for [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Bond Cocktail'' spoke of the challenges in creating a Bond score, and specifically, the Bond theme song "[You have to] marry the Bond sound with modern technology. Alongside the electronic stuff you've still got to have the orchestra playing the old stuff so you're constantly reminded of where you are. If James Bond abandoned his [[black tie|dinner jacket]], [[Womanizer|womanising]], or [[List of James Bond gadgets|gadget-using]] you'd feel cheated. The music is a safety net for the audience, without it you haven't got a James Bond movie, you've got an [[action film|action movie]]."<ref name="cocktail" /> On the movie's DVD commentary he also added: "Don Black has a way with the word where as you sing it, it falls out of your mouth. I think we had a combination of strong theatrical material, we had strong lyrics and we had the perfect band for this movie. The recording process was easy, everyone was on the same page, we got it done really quickly".<ref name="comment2" />

Speaking to Jam! Music, singer Shirley Manson said "Vocally, it's a big change for me. It requires a very wide range, and you can't hide behind any effect. Basically, it's just my voice. I was terrified, and I kept weeping to my friends, 'I'm going to look a fool! There's no way I'm going to be able to carry this off!' They reassured me, saying, 'No matter what happens, at least you won't come last, because you couldn't be worse than [[A-Ha]].' It's been great for us because we have long wanted to do a Bond theme. The likelihood of our getting the chance was extremely minute."<ref name="jam" /> Speaking to documentary makers, whilst in the recording studio in August 1999 she told them how she felt about doing the theme: "We said it all along when we got together in Garbage if we had a dream it would be to record the Bond theme. The sensibility is quite similar to how we approach [[Musical composition|making music]]. I jumped at the chance [to record the theme] because I think it's an institution I admire and has always captured my imagination since I was a child. The entire time I felt unworthy, but to sing with a full orchestra is exhilarating!"<ref name="cocktail" /> Manson also told Kerrang! magazine in September 1999 that "one of the biggest attractions in doing a Bond song is that you know it's going down in movie history."<ref name="kerrang">''"I Am A Bond Girl!", [[Kerrang!]] magazine (issue [[November 17|17/11]]/[[1999|99]])''</ref>

Garbage drummer [[Butch Vig]] told [[CNN]] "We were trying to make sure the arrangement was good, because the song has a very dynamic and sweeping melody line. This was the first time we ever recorded with a 60-piece orchestra and that was a most excellent experience. We're pretty pleased with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, it sounds like a Garbage song. And to Bond fans, it's a Bond song."<ref name="cnn">{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/1999/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/15/music.bond.soundtrack/index.html/ |title="For Garbage, the world of Bond is not enough"|publisher=''CNN.com''|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref> He told MKKBB "The orchestra took up so much space and really dictated where the song was going [[Dynamics (music)|dynamically]]. The dynamics are incredible with this piece, so it really kept our recording a lot simpler. Besides the drums and bass and some [[percussion|percussive]] [[Music loop|loops]], there's a little bit of guitar that Duke and Steve did. But there's not a lot of miscellaneous tracks on there. There's a few little ear candy things that we did, but it's all meant to work around Shirley's singing".<ref name="kiss"/> Guitarist Steve Marker added to Kerrang!: "The music has always played such a big part in Bond movies. It was a challenge for us not to screw it up too badly!"<ref name="kerrang" />

Although Garbage has recorded the theme, the band didn't actually get to go to ''The World Is Not Enough'' premiere. They had to make do with a local showing of the film in [[Tucson, Arizona]] during a break from their tour. "We were on tour so we couldn't make it", Butch Vig told CNN, "But we saw the movie in Tucson with a regular audience during its opening weekend. By the time we left the theater, there were like 500 kids standing outside and asking for autographs, so we had our own little mini-premiere."<ref name="cnn"/>

==Media reaction==

The prospect of Garbage performing the theme tune was first reported by ''[[Music Week]]'' magazine on [[June 24]], [[1999]] and stated that the theme had been demoed and given the thumbs-up and that Garbage had the "inside track" on the song after [[Jamiroquai]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[Sharleen Spiteri]] of [[Texas (band)|Texas]], [[Björk]] and [[Spice Girl]] [[Melanie C]] all had their vocals rejected by the movie's producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianfleming.org/007news/articles/musicweek.shtml/ |title="Bond song deal ready to be finalized"|publisher=''IanFleming.org''|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref> The ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported on [[July 9]] that a "Bond insider" had told them "The fact that [Garbage], though American, are fronted by a Brit was very appealing.".

David Arnold later spoke to the [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] and denied the Music Week report that Robbie Williams, Jamiroquai and Björk had auditioned for the part. Arnold was keen to point out that the theme song was not written with a specific singer in mind. He said he wrote a song that would be right for the movie - not the type of song that one artist might sing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianfleming.org/007news/articles/garbagetimes.shtml/|title="Garbage talks to the Times"|publisher=''IanFleming.org''|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref>  By late July songwriter Don Black had spoken to [[Dotmusic]] saying, "The song reflects the film. It tells the story, which of course is all about world domination, but is a lot more personal and intense. It's quite ballady and dramatic, but feels contemporary."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianfleming.org/007news/articles/garbage-official.shtml/|title="It's Official: Garbage lands song""|publisher=''IanFleming.org''|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref>

Garbage was not officially confirmed as the performers of the nineteenth Bond theme until [[August 4]], [[1999]]. The James Bond [[website]] posted a [[press release]] from Bond producers [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]] saying "We are thrilled to be working with such an innovative group and believe the collaboration between David Arnold, Don Black and Garbage will make this one of the most memorable Bond songs." [[Gary Kurfirst]], head of Radioactive Records and [[executive producer]] for the project, stated in a company press release "I've known Barbara Broccoli for years, and I'm delighted that we have an opportunity to work together. The score for the film is first rate and the Garbage track is stellar. Our own Shirley Manson is spectacular as always".<ref name="pressrel">"Radioactive Records Press Release dated Nov 8th, 1999" (accessed [[February 2]], [[2007]])</ref> MGM's [[Chief executive officer|President]] Jay Boberg followed up "Every James Bond film is a vital piece of [[popular culture]], and as a life-long Bond fan, thrilled at releasing the soundtrack". And, in contrast to MGM's earlier negative opinion of the track, he also added, "Garbage is one of the best contemporary bands, and they turned in a [[bravura]] performance on the title track."<ref name="pressrel"/>

Paul Atkinson, who produced the [[EMI]] [[compilation album]] ''"[[The Best of Bond...James Bond]]"'' told CNN "For each [Bond] movie, the musical artist picked is always someone who's well known, an act with a name. It's a good marketing decision to associate yourself with an artist who is hip and very commercial. And Garbage is going to get a lot of exposure, lots of MTV play."<ref name="comment2"/>"

==Critical reception==

"The World Is Not Enough" was generally well-received by contemporary pop music critics, although a small number of critics targeted the song for being 'too Bond, and not enough Garbage'. Kerrang! magazine noted that "Nothing takes a band into the truly immortal like a Bond theme, and Garbage's ever burgeoning celebrity will be done no harm whatsoever by this appropriately lush and orchestral anthem".<ref>"Kerrang! issue 13/11/99" (accessed [[February 3]], [[2007]]</ref> [[Radio Times]]'s AJ noted that the song "sounds like Shirley Bassey revisited",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/servlet_film/com.icl.beeb.rtfilms.client.simpleSearchServlet?searchTypeSelect=5&frn=24889/ |title="Radio Times Film Review"|publisher=''Radiotimes.com''|accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> while [[All Music Guide]]'s Steve Thomas Erlewine wrote that Garbage had "expertly modernized the classic Bond sound, while turning in a strong melodic tune. A first class theme song".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/14243289/|title="AMG review: The World Is Not Enough OST"|publisher=''Music.Yahoo.com''|accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref>

Most negative comments towards the theme centred around its classic Bond sound. [[LAUNCHcast]]'s James Poletti commented whilst the song was a "perfectly competent Bond theme" but "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps they would have done better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/l_reviews_s/12123.html/|title= "Garbage : The World Is Not Enough"|publisher=''LAUNCHcast''|accessdsate=2007-02-02}}</ref> [[Melody Maker]] was rather critical in their single review, stating, "you know what this sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?"<ref>''Melody Maker'' issue [[November 13|13/11]]/[[1999|99]]</ref> The song also ended in two "best of 1999" polls: #87 in [[89X]]'s "Top 89 Songs of 1999"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklists.com/89x-1999.html|title=89X's "Top 89 Songs of 1999|publisher=[http://www.rocklists.com/ Rocklists.com]|accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref> and #100 in [[Q101]]'s "Top 101 of 1999".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1999.html|title=Q101's "Top 101 of 1999|publisher=[http://www.rocklists.com/ Rocklists.com]|accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref>

A low-quality [[mp3]] file was circulated through [[file-sharing]] networks, after being [[ripping|ripped]] from an [[Los Angeles|LA]] [[radio station]] broadcast. It quickly became apparent that this leak was in fact not the actual theme tune, but a remix produced by the band themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianfleming.org/007news/articles/twinetheme.shtml/|title= "Bond song airs, hits the Net"|publisher=''IanFleming.org''|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref> The actual album version of the song was sent to US [[Adult album alternative|AAA]], Alternative, [[Adult contemporary music|Modern Adult]] and [[Modern Rock]] radio stations from [[October 4]], [[1999]], although the song did not officially debut on radio stations until [[October 11]], [[1999]].<ref name="pressrel"/> The song failed to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay]] chart, however it placed on the U.S. [[ARC Weekly Top 40]], a chart unassociated with Billboard.

The strength of the single's sales prompted Garbage's European distributor [[BMG]] to re-issue their 1999 "[[When I Grow Up]]" single in February 2000. The single also reached #15 on the [[United World Chart]], debuting in the top 40 on [[December 4]], [[1999]] at #36, and achieving a 12-week chart run.<ref name="uwchart">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediatraffic.de/week48-1999.htm/|title="United World Chart: week 48, 1999"|publisher=''MediaTraffic.de''|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref>

The theme's parent soundtrack album ''[[The World Is Not Enough (soundtrack)|The World Is Not Enough]]'' was released in the US on Radioactive Records / MCA on [[November 9]], [[1999]], just over a week prior to the movie's US theatrical release on [[November 19]], [[1999]]. The UK release of the soundtrack was on [[November 22]], [[1999]], preceding the UK release of the movie on [[November 26]], [[1999]].

[[MTV Europe]] heavily promoted the single as part of an [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] tie-in with ''The World Is Not Enough'' movie - the channel even broadcast the [[promotional video]] for the single across Europe in the minutes prior to the awards show going live on air.  EMA's guest presenters Bond actor [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Bond girl]] [[Denise Richards]] gave away a [[BMW Z8]], featured in the promotional video for the single, on the night of the event.<ref name="mtvema">{{cite web|url=http://www.ianfleming.org/007news/articles/twinemusicvideo.shtml/| title="TWINE music video premieres"|publisher=''IanFleming.org''|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref>

The version of "The World Is Not Enough" in the actual movie is a [[remix]] of the song, edited and with more of the orchestra in the mix. It has never been released in audio form.  The Chilled Out remix was planned to be the single's [[B-side]] in the UK but the [[A-side]] in North America. The mix downplays the Bond sound in favour of a more easily recognisable Garbage style. Garbage completed this alternative version in September 1999 at their own studio.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.garbage.net/garbage/articles/@8-99.htm/|title="New Garbage, new danger"|publisher=''[[Kerrang!]]''}}</ref> UNKLE's "Remix Beats" remix is only available on the UNKLESounds release ''"[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Beats?]]"'' <small>(CMB 50)</small> (2003). 

Garbage member [[Steve Marker]] claimed that the band remixed the song many times over, including the "Chilled Out Remix" released promotionally, although the "Hawaiian Luau Trance remix" he once mentioned on the band's website might be a joke.<ref> {{cite web|author=[[Steve Marker|Marker, Steve]]|url=http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=68|title=Garbage.com news.jornal|date=1999-10-04|publisher=''Garbage.com''|accessdate=2007-03-03}}</ref>

==Music video==
[[Image:Twinevideo2shirleys.JPG|thumb|right|The android Manson (right) walks in on the real Manson in the "The World Is Not Enough" clip.]] 

The song's promotional video features a plot set in 1964 which involves scientists [[cloning]] singer Shirley Manson on an unnamed [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] island. The clone is an [[android]] replica of Manson whom, in true Bond style, has the ability to kill her enemies with a single kiss. She has also been fitted with an [[explosive device]] that is set prior to leaving on her mission. The android Manson makes her way through the storyline; killing one male [[research subject]] with her fatal kiss, then driving to the fictional [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] New Globe Theater and killing the real Shirley Manson with another kiss. The android Manson then impersonates the real Manson on stage with Garbage whilst her bomb is ticking down to zero. Manson plays both the android and herself in the video, and in one scene kisses a look-alike model acting as her double.

The promotional video for the single was produced by Oil Factory films, directed by [[Philipp Stölzl]] and shot in Black Island Studios, London on a two-day shooting schedule taking place on [[September 23]] and [[September 24]], 1999. Shooting most of Shirley Manson's android scenes (laboratory scene, both kissing scenes and her driving scene) took place on the first day of shooting; the rest of the band joined Manson for the stage, globe and [[pyrotechnic]] scenes on the second day.<ref name="makingthevideo"> {{cite episode|title=[[Making The Video]] - Garbage: The World Is Not Enough|date=16 October 1999 |medium=TV|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> [[Post-production]] and [[editing]] was completed over the following two weeks.<ref name="mtvema"/>

Director Stoelzl came up with the main concept for the music video - to have Shirley Manson play a killer-clone of herself. Butch Vig described the shoot as "much more of a pain in the ass than recording the song. It was like making a mini Bond film."<ref name="cnn"/> John Pennicott, whose company supplied the android shooting model, told MTV "The inspiration for the look of the android [was taken from] Philipp's drawings and his [[storyboard]]. We used [[aircraft]] parts, bits from [[guided missiles]], bits of tubing, metal and plastic. We can put them together and emulate his drawings. The elements within the android are used in post-production to combine with Shirley so that she looks as though she has a mechanical inside".<ref name="makingthevideo"/>

Butch Vig spoke to MKKBB "He drew up a [[Film treatment|treatment]] that we really liked and for whatever reason, because [they were] paying for it, MGM and EON felt that it was not 'Bond' enough. We went back and forth with that cause we were also trying to make a Garbage video. Then Philip came back with a second treatment that was amazing. It reminds me of that [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] film (''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''). Some of the shots look like [[Stanley Kubrick]]. Visually it's a really cool looking, amazing looking video" and also "For us it was just important that the music video was a Garbage video. It's already the song from the film and the whole elements of it are very sort of Bond-esque with the whole lyrics structure. And there are these sort of nods in it that are maybe sort of [[homage]]s to the classic bond [[Screenplay|structure and scenario]]!"<ref name="kiss"/>

The globe, upon which the android Shirley Manson performs, references the large globe in [[Karl Stromberg]]'s lair from [[1977]]'s ''The Spy Who Loved Me''. The red dress that the android Manson wore in the climax to the "The World Is Not Enough" music video was by [[Valentino]].

The [[Director of Photography]] who worked on the promotional video shoot for "The World Is Not Enough", [[John Mathieson]], went on to become the DP to [[Ridley Scott]] and worked on both ''[[Gladiator (film)|Gladiator]]'' and ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'', earning a [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] [[Academy Award]] nomination for the former.

Shirley Manson told Melody Maker "Our video is like a mini-Bond action-packed film, where an android removes evil from the world and sacrifices herself in the process like a [[kamikaze]] warrior. That's as close as we'll ever get [to being in a Bond movie]." Butch adds, "We just love the idea that Shirley is a bomb. That there's this evil Shirley and a good Shirley and you don't know exactly who. I think you figure it out by the end. It's very [[Camp (style)|campy]] too. There's always a bit of that camp factor in some of the Bond films. We thought there were certainly a lot of very Bond-esque moments in the video that we thought worked really well, and we're pleased with how it turned out".

''The World Is Not Enough'' video shoot was documented by a [[Making The Video]] camera crew, as well as journalists from UK rock magazine Kerrang!. The video made its worldwide [[premiere]] following the MTV ''Making The Video'' special on [[October 20]], [[1999]], and debuting on [[Total Request Live|TRL]] the following day. The music video made its UK broadcast premiere on [[MTV UK and Ireland]] who broadcast the ''Making The Video'' special and the video on [[October 21]] and its [[terrestrial television]] premiere on [[Channel Four]]'s [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]] scheduling slot on [[October 25]], [[1999]].<ref name="mtvema"/>

===Promotional video edits===

Two edits of the video for "The World Is Not Enough" video exist&mdash;one with movie footage, and one without. The standard edit of the video can be found on all releases issued by Garbage's record label, and was shown by most networks globally. The edit that includes footage from the movie was mostly broadcast on [[US]] music channels. It is included as a 'special feature' [[DVD]] extra on the worldwide 2002 "The World Is Not Enough"  [[Special edition|DVD Special Edition]] release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/twine.shtml/|title="TWINE Special Edition review"|publisher=''DVDmg.com''|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref> The video is also included on the 2006 re-packaged "Ultimate Edition" release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62189/|title= "TWINE Ultimate Edition review"|publisher= ''DVDTimes.co.uk''|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref>

Butch Vig told MKKBB "In this case because it was really [[narrative]], I mean some videos are more sort of abstract and don't really have a plot line. In this case it was pretty important that you sort of maintain that narrative. There's one [edit of the video] without [movie footage] and there's one where the screen flips to the side in the second version - 15 or 20 seconds of footage inserted in a split screen in the second verse, so the narrative is still in the left screen and there's some quick stills from the movie on the right screen".<ref name="kiss"/>

==Live performances==

[[Image:GarbageLetterman1199-2.jpg|thumb|right|Garbage performing "The World Is Not Enough" on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'']] "The World Is Not Enough" was first performed live at the [[University of Denver]], [[Colorado]] on [[20 October]] [[1999]] and regularly performed as a show encore during each night of Garbage's [[MTV]] Campus Invasion Tour. The band performed a stripped down version (without [[String instrument|strings]]) each time until its last ever performance in [[University of California, Irvine|University of California]], [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] on [[24 November]] [[1999]]; also the last date of the ''Version 2.0'' world tour.<ref name="setlist">{{cite web|url=http://www.garbagebase.com/g-1999.html/|title=Garbage 1999 setlists|publisher=''Garbagebase.com''|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> Butch told MKKBB "In Denver I don't think anyone knew what it was and then we played it in [[Western Illinois University]] (in [[Macomb, Illinois|Macomb]]) and [[University of Chicago]] and the crowd went nuts when we played it."<ref name="kiss"/>

"The World Is Not Enough" was also performed live on the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' on [[November 1]], [[1999]]. That performance was the only televised promotional appearance for the single.<ref name="setlist" />

==Copyright infringement civil court case (2004)==

In June 2004 song-writers [[Frank P. Fogerty]] and [[Nathan Crow]] sued MGM Group Holdings Corp., Inc., Universal Music Group, Inc., [[Universal Studios]], Inc., and EON Productions, Ltd. for [[copyright infringement]]. The action was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee]], claiming that "The World Is Not Enough" was similar to a song called "This Game We Play" that they had written together and submitted to MGM for inclusion on 1999s ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (featuring Bond actor Pierce Brosnan in the [[Leading actor|lead role]]).<ref name="findlaw"/>

It was agreed in court that "The World Is Not Enough" shared an identical four-note sequence with "This Game We Play". MGM [[Motion (legal)|moved]] for [[summary judgment]], claiming that there was undisputed facts showing that Arnold independently created "The World Is Not Enough". The district court granted MGM’s motion. Fogerty and Crow eventually conceded that Arnold did not have access to "This Game We Play" until after Crow had delivered a recording of the song to MGM in February 1999. It was proved in court, with [[journal]] entries, delivery [[invoice]]s, phone call records, computer records, and [[Deposition (law)|testimony]] from Arnold, Black, Manson and Arnold's [[personal assistant]] Trish Hillis as irrefutable evidence that "The World Is Not Enough" had already been written and had not been changed significantly, aside from a lyrical change to the song (the removal of one line to accommodate Shirley Manson) and one change to the score (the removal of the “three-note motif” to accommodate the MGM executives), from the date that Fogerty and Crow had submitted their track to MGM.<ref name="findlaw"/>
