==Gameplay==
[[Image:Turokscreen2.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The game contains many types of difficult jumping platforms, such as these pillars.]]
As a first-person shooter, the player in ''Turok: Dinosaur Hunter'' is armed with a vast array of weaponry to take on various enemies, such as soldiers, [[demon]]s, [[dinosaur]]s, [[aliens]], and large [[insect]]s.<ref name="booklet"/> Each [[level (computer and video games)|level]] contains keys which must be collected in order to access the next world, linked by a hub.<ref name="booklet"/>  The game features a large number of [[Platform game|platforming]] and adventure elements, with many types of walls, cliffs, and underwater [[cave]]rns to be explored. Besides obtaining ammunition, the player can acquire [[1-up|extra lives]] by collecting floating runes, scattered across the levels.<ref name="booklet"/> Lastly, the player can obtain pieces of the Chronoscepter, the game's most powerful weapon, to be used against the final [[boss (video games)|boss]].<ref name="booklet"/>

==Plot==
The game's setting takes place in the Lost Land, a primitive world inhabited by dinosaurs and other creatures. According to the game's [[Instruction manual (computer and video games)|instruction manual]], Turok is a [[time travel|time-travelling]] warrior who ends up in the Lost Land.<ref name="booklet"/> The Campaigner is trying to gain the Chronoscepter weapon, and by using a focusing array to magnify the Chronoscepter's power, he plans to destroy the barriers that separate the ages of time and rule the universe.<ref name="booklet" /> Turok then vows to find the Chronoscepter himself, and sets off to put an end to his scheme. After battling through various areas of the Lost Land, including [[catacombs]], a treetop village, a ruined city, and defeating bosses such as a fire-breathing ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', Turok ends up at The Campaigner's [[Fortification|fortress]], where he defeats him in single combat.

An interesting note about the storyline is that it is nearly non-existent out of the instruction manual, as there is no in-game dialogue and the player is only given the task of finding keys to open new areas in the opening [[cut scene]], and not given the backstory.<ref> Locate the hub ruins.

==Development==
Production of ''Dinosaur Hunter'' commenced in [[1995 in video games|1995]], and while loosely based off the comic book, the developers, Iguana Entertainment, made the game much more action-oriented.<ref name="IGNint">{{cite web | title =Interview with the Creator of Turok |author= IGN Staff |publisher = IGN | year = 1997 |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060483p1.html | accessdate=2006-11-01}}</ref> An early idea during development was for it to be in a third-person perspective, similar to ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', but was decided against in order to keep the player immersed in the game's world.<ref name="IGNint"/> [[Game producer]] and [[Game designer|designer]] David Dienstbier stated that the Nintendo 64 was used due to its superior processing capabilities compared to the personal computers available at the time, and to showcase the console's graphical abilities, although it was later [[Porting|ported]] to the Windows platform.<ref name="IGNint"/>

Originally slated for a holiday [[1996 in video gaming|1996]] release, the game was delayed to 1997 in order to keep the quality high, and according to Nintendo, to "add more depth to the gameplay."<ref name="delayed">{{cite web | title=Turok Delayed Until January |author=IGN Staff |publisher=IGN | year=1996 |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060320p1.html | accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref> Even before it was made available to purchase, Acclaim announced that a sequel, tentatively titled ''[[Turok 2: Seeds of Evil|Turok: Dinosaur Hunter 2]]'', was to be released later that same year.<ref name="Turok 2">{{cite web | title=Turok 2 Confirmed for 1997 |author=IGN Staff |publisher=IGN | year=1997 |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060454p1.html | accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref>

==Reception==
[[Image:Turokscreen1.JPG|right|250px|thumb|''Turok'''s distance fog keeps visibility to a small radius around the player. In this screenshot, a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' approaches while the player takes aim with a [[shotgun]].]]
Worldwide sales of ''Dinosaur Hunter'' surpassed [[United States dollar|USD]]$60 million in late June of 1997.<ref name="BW">{{cite web | title =Acclaim Entertainment And Golden Books Family Entertainment Announce Licensing Agreement With Playmates Toys Inc.

''Turok: Dinosaur Hunter'' was well received at the time of its release, garnering an 85 out of possible 100 on [[Metacritic]], or "Generally favorable".<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web | title =Turok: Dinosaur Hunter (n64: 1997): Reviews |author=  |publisher = Metacritic | year = |url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/n64/turokdinosaurhunter?q=Turok | accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref>  Doug Perry of the multimedia website [[IGN]] awarded the game an 8.6 out of a possible 10. He said the game "stands on the shoulders of all previous ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' games", and the gameplay takes the title to places "''Doom''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s never been".<ref name="IGNrev">{{cite web | title =Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Review |author= Doug Perry |publisher = IGN | year = 1997 |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/150/150425p1.html | accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref> As the website [[GameSpot]] noted, the game "mimics a hunting safari" and like [[IGN]], adds that it is "more than just another [[Doom clone]]."<ref name="GSrev">{{cite web | title =Turok: Dinosaur Hunter for Nintendo 64 Review |author= Jeff Gerstmann |publisher = GameSpot | year = 1997 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/n64/action/turokdinosaurhunter/review.html | accessdate=2006-10-30}}</ref> 

[[Distance fog]] was used to keep the game's [[frame rate]] high. As GameSpot said, "enemies beam to your location in a [[Star Trek]] fashion", but that the fog is a "neat effect" as enemies would appear out of the mist "fangs first".<ref name="GSrev" /> However, IGN commented that the player cannot look into the distance and rely upon the game's map to do so, although that this was a small exception to the graphical abilities.<ref name="IGNrev" /> ''Edge'' expressed that Iguana used "every special effect imaginable" when it created the environments, and awarded a 9 out of 10 score.<ref name="Edge"/> ''Edge'' also said that the game contradicts the notion at the time that only [[Nintendo]] could create superior titles for the console.<ref name="Edge"/>
