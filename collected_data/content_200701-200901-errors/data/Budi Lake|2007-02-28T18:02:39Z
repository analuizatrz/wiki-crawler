The '''Budi Lake''' ({{lang-es|Lago Budi}} from the [[mapudungun]] word ''Füzi'' wich means salt) is located near the coast of [[Araucanía Region]], [[southern Chile]]". The lake  is part of the boundaries beetwen [[Saavedra, Chile|Saavedra]] and [[Teodoro Schmidt]] comune. 

Budi Lake is among the few lakes of the West coast of the Americas that have seasonal inflows of sea water. Another difference to many Chilean lakes is that Budi Lake is not of glacial origin and does not lies in the [[Andes]] mountains. Budi Lake is above a coastal plain just south of [[Nahuelbuta]] Range and north of the [[Valdinvian Coastal Range]] where the [[Chilean Coast Range]] is heavily eroded.

Acording to the census of 2002, the zone around the lake is one the poorest parts of [[Araucanía Region]], Chiles poorest region in turn.
