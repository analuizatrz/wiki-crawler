'''Ronald Ernest “Ron” Paul''' (born [[20 August]] [[1935]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[physician]], [[United States Congress|congressman]] and [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential candidate]] from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he has represented [[Texas's 14th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] since 1997, and had previously served as the representative from [[Texas's 22nd congressional district|Texas's 22nd district]] in [[1976]] and from [[1979]] to [[1985]]. 

In 1984, Paul ran in the Republican [[Primary election|primary]] for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat vacated by [[John Tower]], but the nomination went to [[Phil Gramm]]. Paul also supported [[term limit]]s for [[members of Congress]] at the time and likened himself to the famous Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. Paul was the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] nominee for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 election]]. After his failed presidential bid, Paul returned to Congress in 1997. He was again elected as a Republican, but against the wishes of the party leadership, which had backed Paul's primary opponent. His opponent in the primary was the incumbent representative.  On [[11 January]] [[2007]], Paul announced the formation of an [[exploratory committee]] for a [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].  He formally declared his candidacy [[12 March]] [[2007]] as a guest on [[Washington Journal]] on [[C-SPAN]].[http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA031207.paul2008.EN.74141d9.html]

== Early life and education ==
Paul was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] to Howard Caspar Paul and Margaret Paul.<ref>http://dailypaul.com/node/53</ref><ref>http://www.wargs.com/political/paul.html</ref> He graduated from Dormont High School in [[Dormont, Pennsylvania]], in 1953. Paul attended [[Gettysburg College]], receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1957, and the [[Duke University School of Medicine]], receiving [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1961. He did his [[internship]] and [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] at [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] from 1961 to 1962, and was a [[flight surgeon]] in the [[United States Air Force]] from 1963 to 1968. Paul completed [[obstetrics and gynecology]] training at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] while in the Air Force from 1965&ndash;1968, and in 1968 he and his wife Carol moved to [[Surfside Beach, Texas]].

=== Early political career ===
He became a [[delegate]] to the Texas state Republican [[Political convention|convention]] in [[1974]]. He was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for election to Congress in 1974 against the incumbent Democrat [[Robert R. Casey]]. When President [[Gerald R. Ford]] appointed Casey as head of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], a [[special election]] was held in [[April]] 1976 to replace him. Paul won that election but lost six months later in the general election to Democrat [[Robert Gammage|Robert A. Gammage]]. He then defeated Gammage in a [[1978]] rematch. Paul won new terms in [[1980]] and [[1982]]. He was the first congressman to propose term limit legislation for the House of Representatives. Paul was an unsuccessful candidate for US Senate in the 1984 GOP primary. In [[1985]], Paul returned to medical practice. He was succeeded by [[Tom DeLay]]. 

In 1988, Paul won the nomination of the [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party]] for the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidency]]. He placed third in the popular vote (with 431,750 votes - 0.47%), behind [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Michael Dukakis]].

=== Return to Congress ===
In [[1996]], Paul was again elected to the House as a Republican. Mainstream Republican Party figures backed the incumbent, [[Greg Laughlin]], a [[conservative Democrat]] representative who had switched parties in the wake of the Republican takeover of Congress.  Laughlin attempted to portray Paul's views as extreme and eccentric, but Paul won the primary and went on to win the general election. 

Leaders of the Texas Republican Party made similar efforts to defeat him in [[1998]], but he again won the primary and the election. The Republican congressional leadership then agreed to a compromise: Paul votes with the Republicans on procedural matters and remains nominally Republican in exchange for the committee assignments normally due according to his seniority. This is arguably similar to the deal that [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]] had with the Democratic Party (though Jeffords was elected as a Republican and was officially an independent until his retirement in January 2007). Paul was convincingly re-elected in [[2000]] and [[2002]]. He was elected unopposed in 2004 to his ninth term in the Congress, and was re-elected again in 2006 by a 20-point margin.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//pages/results/states/TX/index.html State Races, Texas] on CNN accessed at [[March 4]] [[2007]]</ref> He is a member of the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]].

== Political affiliations and support ==

Ron Paul joined the Libertarian Party in [[1987]] as a lifetime member, a status which he appears never to have renounced. Though only elected to Congress as a Republican, Paul remains on good terms with the Libertarian Party and has addressed its [[Libertarian National Convention|national convention]] as recently as [[2004]].<ref>[http://www.theadvocates.org/liberator/vol-09-num-10.htm Liberator online archive] on Advocates for self-governing accessed at [[March 4]] [[2007]]</ref>

Libertarian Party spokesman George Getz said that thousands of libertarians across the United States donated money to Ron Paul's campaign funds. Campaign disclosures reveal that 71.4 percent of contributions to Paul's coffers come from outside his home state of Texas. <ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/geog.asp?CID=N00005906&cycle=2004 Ron Paul: Campaign Finance/Money Contributors - Congressman 2004] on opensecrets.org acessed at [[March 4]] [[2007]]</ref> Unlike many political candidates, Paul receives the overwhelming majority of his [[campaign finance|campaign contributions]] (92.5% in 2004 and 96.8% in 2006) from individuals. <ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.asp?CID=N00005906&cycle=2004 Ron Paul: Campaign Finance/Money Contributors - Congressman 2004] on opensecrets.org acessed at [[March 4]] [[2007]]</ref><ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.asp?CID=N00005906&cycle=2006 Ron Paul: Campaign Finance/Money Contributors - Congressman 2006] on opensecrets.org acessed at [[March 4]] [[2007]]</ref>
