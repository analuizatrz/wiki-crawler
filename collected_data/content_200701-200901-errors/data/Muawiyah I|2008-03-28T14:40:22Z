'''Muawiyah I''' ({{Lang-ar-at|a=معاوية بن أبي سفيان|t=Mu‘āwīyah ibn Abī Sufyān}}; 602-680) was a companion of the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] and later the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]] in Damascus. He engaged in a civil war against the fourth and final [[Rightly Guided Caliph|Rightly Guided]] [[Caliph]], [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali]] (Muhammad's son-in-law) and met with considerable military success, including the seizure of [[Egypt]].  He assumed the [[caliphate]] after Ali's assassination in 661 and reigned until 680.

Because he opposed Ali, whom the [[Shia]] Muslims believe was Muhammad's true successor (see [[Succession to Muhammad]]), he has been hated and reviled by generations of Shi'a. 

==Early life==
Muawiyah ibn Abi-Sufyan was born (c. 600) into a powerful clan, ([[Banu Abd Shams]]), of the  [[Quraysh]] tribe. The Quraysh controlled the city of [[Mecca]], in what is now western [[Saudi Arabia]], and the Banu Abd-Shams were among the most influential of its citizens. His father, [[Abu Sufyan]], opposed Muhammad before becoming a Muslim after the Prophet conquered [[Mecca]]. His mother, Hind bint Utba, ripped the chest of [[Hamza_ibn_Abd_al-Muttalib|Hamza]] (uncle of Mohammad) in the battle of [[Uhud]] and chewed his liver. Muawiyah is reported to have been of a polite, charming and confident nature and has been described as being tall, fair and handsome in appearance.

In 630 CE, Muhammad and his followers conquered Mecca, and most of the Meccans, including the Abd-Shams, formally submitted to Muhammad and accepted Islam. General consensus among early Islamic historians is that Muawiyah, along with his father Abu Sufyan, became Muslims at the conquest of Mecca when further resistance to Muslims became an impossibility. <ref> The History of al-Tabari, Volume IX, The Last Years of the Prophet, p32, SUNY Press</ref> <ref> Life of Muhammad, Ibn Hisham, Volume 2, p597 (Urdu) </ref> According to some historians {{Who|date=July 2007}} <!-- Please do not remove this tag without providing proper sources. Thanks. --> Muāwiyya accepted Islam in defiance of his relatives.

Muhammad welcomed his former opponents, enrolled them in his army and gave them important posts in the expanding Islamic empire. During Muhammad's last years, Muawiyah served him by writing down the revelations of the [[Qur'an]] which were revealed to the Prophet. After Muhammad's death in 632, he served in the Islamic army sent against the [[Roman Empire|Byzantine]] forces in present-day [[Syria]]. He held a high rank in the Muslim Army with his brother [[Yazid bin Abu Sufyan]].

== Governor of Syria ==
Caliph [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] had appointed [[Yazid Ibn Abu Sufyan]] as governor of Syria. In the year 640, Umar appointed Muawiyah, the brother of Yazid Ibn Abu Sufyan, as governor of Syria when the latter died due to an outbreak of plague. Muawiyah gradually gained mastery over the other areas of Syria, instilling remarkable personal loyalty among his troops and the people of the region. By 647, Muawiyah had built a Syrian army strong enough to repel a Roman attack and, in subsequent years, to take the offensive against the Romans in campaigns that resulted in the capture of [[Cyprus]] (649) and [[Rhodes]] (654) and a devastating defeat of the Roman navy off the coast of [[Lycia]] (655). At the same time, Muawiyah periodically dispatched land expeditions into [[Anatolia]].

According to the chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]],Muawiyah I after capturing [[Rhodes]] sold the remains [[Colossus of Rhodes]] to a traveling salesman from [[Edessa]]. The buyer had the statue broken down, and transported the bronze scrap on the backs of 900 camels to his home. Pieces continued to turn up for sale for years, after being found along the caravan route. 

All these campaigns came to a halt with the accession of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali]] to the [[caliphate]], when a new and decisive phase of Muawiyah's career began.

== Conflict with Ali ==
Muawiyah sought justice for the assassinated caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]]. [[Aisha]] (Muhammad's widow), [[Talha]] and [[Zubayr ibn al-Awwam]] were all in agreement with Muawiyah that those who assassinated Uthman should be brought to justice.  However, Ali refused to apprehend and punish Uthman's murderers, citing rebel infiltration of the Muslim ranks resulting in Muawiyah's refusal to acknowledge Ali's caliphate.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} However, Muawiyah did ''not'' participate in the Rebellion of Aisha, Talha and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam who went to war against Ali in the [[Battle of Bassorah|Battle of the Camel]]. It should be noted that Aisha, Talha, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and Muawiyah did not want to cause Muslim bloodshed <ref> The Early Caliphate, Maulana Muhammad Ali, Al-Jadda Printers, pg. 169-206, 1983 </ref>. The following few sentences from a speech made by Aisha before the start of the Battle of the Camel speak for themselves:
<blockquote>
"People used to find fault with Uthman and his officers. They would come to Madina and consult us. They understood whatever advice we gave them about keeping peace and order. When we considered the grievances they had against Uthman, we found Uthman innocent, God-fearing, and truthful, and these agitators, sinful, treacherous and liars. Their hearts concealed one thing whereas their lips gave utterance to another. When they gathered strength and entered the house of innocent Uthman without any just cause and shed blood which it was not lawful to shed. They plundered what it was not lawful to take. They desecrated the soil whose sanctity it was their duty to respect. Now listen! The work before us which it does not behove us to neglect is to arrest the assassins of Uthman and see that the law of God has its way".{{Fact|date=December 2007}}</blockquote> 

The city of Basrah fell to Aisha, Talha and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam. Most of the mischief mongers{{Fact|date=December 2007}} were rounded up and killed. Nonetheless, Ali was victorious and pardoned Aisha, had her escorted to Medina and allocated her a pension. Talha and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam were killed in the Battle of the Camel.

Ali then turned towards Syria, which was in open revolt under governor Muawiyah. He marched to the [[Euphrates]] and engaged Muawiyah's troops at the famous [[Battle of Siffin]] (657). Accounts of the clash vary -- however, it would seem that neither side had won a victory, since the Syrians called for arbitration to settle the matter, arguing that continuing civil war would embolden the [[Byzantines]].<ref>pg.22 Mu'awiyah: Restorer of the Muslim Faith, Aisha Bewley, Dar al Taqwa Ltd. 2002.</ref> There are several conflicting accounts of the arbitrations. 

In the meantime, dissension broke out in Ali's camp when some former supporters, later known as [[Kharijites]], felt that Ali had betrayed them by entering into negotiations. Ali set out to quell the Kharijites. At about the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt and some of its citizens were demanding retribution for the blood of Uthman.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali had him replaced with Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr (the brother of Aisha and the son of Islam's first Caliph Abu Bakr Sidiq). Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's rule resulted in widespread rebellion in Egypt.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Seeing these events, Muawiyah ordered Amr ibn As to invade Egypt and was successful in doing so.

When Alī was assassinated in 661, Muawiyah, as commander of the largest force in the Muslim Empire, had the strongest claim to the Caliphate. {{Fact|date=December 2007}}  Ali's son [[Hasan bin Ali|Hasan]], after initial defiance of Muawiyah, ceased hostilities and retired to Medina.

Sunni Muslims claim that Hasan pledged [[allegiance]] to Muawiyah. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Most Shi'a Muslims say that he never pledged allegiance, merely ceased to advance his claim to the caliphate out of consideration for the supporters of Ali's family, who had been much reduced during the tumults of Ali's [[caliphate]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

== Rule ==
After his accession to the position of Caliph by the year 661, Muawiyah governed the geographically and politically disparate Caliphate, which spread from Egypt in the West to [[Iran]] in the East, by strengthening the power of his allies in the newly conquered territories. Prominent positions in the emerging governmental structures were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious tolerance that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, especially in Syria itself. This policy also boosted his popularity and solidified Syria as his power base.
 
To have an insight into Mu’awiyah’s character, we may mention what Ibn Katheer reports in his history book Al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah. “At the height of tension when fighting was about to erupt at Siffin between Ali and Mu’awiyah, Mu’awiyah was informed that the Byzantine Emperor raised a very large army and was drawing very close to the borders of the Muslim state. He wrote to him, giving him a very clear warning, ‘By God, if you do not stop your designs and go back to your place, I will end my dispute with my cousin and will drive you out of the entire land you rule, until I make the earth too tight for you.’ The Byzantine Emperor was scared off and abandoned his plans

Muawiyah instituted several Byzantine-style bureaucracies, called ''[[diwan]]s'', to aid him in the governance and the centralization of the Caliphate and the empire. Early Arabic sources credit two ''diwan''s in particular to Muawiyah: the ''Diwan al-Khatam'' ([[Chancellor|Chancellery]]) and the ''Barid'' (Postal Service), both of which greatly improved communications within the empire.  

Muawiyah died [[May 6]] [[680]]. He was succeeded by his son [[Yazid I]]. Muawiyah had held the expanding empire together by force of his personality, through personal allegiances, in the style of a traditional Arab [[shaykh]]. However Muawiyah's attempt to start a dynasty failed because both Yazid and then his grandson Muawiya II died prematurely. The caliphate eventually went to a descendant of another branch of his clan.

== Legacy ==
Caliph Muawiyah greatly beautified Damascus and developed a court to rival that of Constantinople. He expanded the frontiers of the empire, reaching the very gates of Constantinople at one point, though failing to hold any territory in [[Asia Minor]]. Sunni Muslims credit him with saving the fledgling Muslim nation from post civil war anarchy. 

One of Caliph Muawiyah's most controversial and enduring legacies was his decision to designate his son Yazid as his successor, thereby the Caliphate became a [[dynasty]]. According to Shi'a doctrine, this was a clear violation of the treaty he made with [[Hasan]], in which he said he would not make his son his successor.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} He attempted to preserve the form of the election however, by causing his nobles and the chiefs of the empire to elect and swear allegiance to his son in his own lifetime, a tradition that endured for several succeeding dynasties. 

==Sunni View==
[[Image:Muawiya.gif|right|100px]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hadhrat Muawiyah.jpg|right|100px]] -->
Sunni historians see him as a companion of Muhammad, and worthy of respect although he fought the Rightly Guided Caliph of the time, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. A few historians view him as a fifth [[Rightly Guided Caliph]].
:"Allah, make him guided, a guider, and guide people through him." <ref>Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, Book of Virtues #3824 and Sahih Al-Tirmidhi #3018</ref>

He is favorably depicted in a hadith from [[Bukhari]] which reads:
<blockquote>
"..Muawiyah who was really the best of the two men said to him, "O 'Amr! If these killed those and those killed these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for their women, who would be left with me for their children?" Then Muawiya sent two Quraishi men from the tribe of 'Abd-i-Shams called 'Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and Abdullah bin 'Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, "Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him." So, they went to Al-Hasan and talked and appealed to him to accept peace..." <ref>[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/049.sbt.html#003.049.867 Sahih Bukhari 3:49:867]</ref></blockquote
The Prophet prayed for Mu’awiyah more than once. In one of them, the Prophet is quoted to have said: “My Lord, give him guidance and make him a source of guidance.” (Related by Al-Tirmidhi and Al-Tabarani). In another prayer for Mu’awiyah the Prophet said: “My Lord, teach him the Book (i.e. the Qur’an) and arithmetic, and protect him against suffering.” (Related by Al-Bukhari in his Al-Tareekh). Needless to say, when the Prophet prayed for anyone, his prayer was answered in the clearest and most comprehensive way. Mu’awiyah’s rule was one of the best in our history, second only to that of the four rightly-guided caliphs who were his predecessors

 Sunni scholars rationalize that Hasan's willingness to abandon the caliphate to Muawiyah suggests that Hasan did not view Muawiyah as an apostate, renegade and hypocrite. They argue that Hasan did so for the sake of peace and ending [[Fitnah]]. He gave the caliphate to Muawiyah because he had little support and Muawiyah had conquered most of the cities in the empire and the people of those cities ended up giving him [[bay'ah]]. 

Sunnis tend to discourage criticizing Muawiyah's character and rule, observing his status as a companion of Muhammad. However, Sunnis hold a critical view of Muawiyah's decision to give the Caliphate to his son, Yazid.

==Shi'a View==
The Shi'a tend to vilify Muawiyah. His supposed conversion to Islam before the conquest of Mecca is dismissed as a fable, or mere hypocrisy. He is said to have opposed Ali, the rightful [[Caliph]], out of sheer greed for power and wealth. His reign opened the door to unparalleled disaster, marked by persecution of Ali and his followers, resulting in [[Yazid I]] coming into power, shortly followed by the [[Battle of Karbala]]. He is said to have killed many of Muhammad's companions ([[Sahaba]]), either in battle or by poison, due to his lust for power. He is also accused of killing the children of [[Ubaidullah]]
<blockquote>
[...] Then he [i.e. Mu'awiyah] was informed that Ubaidullah had two infant sons. So he set out to reach them, and when he found them - they had two (tender) forelocks like pearls - [and] he ordered to kill them.<ref>21:6 Secrets of Mu'awiyah from Al-Amali: The Dictations of Sheikh al-Mufid</ref></blockquote>
