== Overview ==
Suzuka was written by Kouji Seo, and featured in the Weekly Shōnen Magazine and published by Kodansha since [[3 March]] [[2004]]. As of March 2007 15 volumes have been released and the series is still ongoing. Suzuka has many parallels to [[Love Hina]], including a girls' dormitory run by an aunt. Suzuka differs from Love Hina in story plot, especially after chapter two when the story becomes unique and plays out Yamato and his friends' lives. 

An anime version was released on [[July 6]] [[2005]] by [[Studio Comet]] under director [[Hiroshi Fukutomi]], and was shown weekly on [[TV Tokyo]]. The series ends with 26 episodes, which coincides with Volume 9, Chapter 72 of the manga. The anime utilized original openings by COACH, and [[Background music|BGM]] by Takumi Masanori. The Suzuka anime series follows the manga closely.

== Plot ==
The plot is based on a young man, Yamato Akitsuki, who moves from his rural home in [[Hiroshima]] [[prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] to live at his aunt's apartment building/indoor bath complex in [[Tokyo]] and attend the local athletics-oriented [[high school]]. Before arriving at his new home he walks past his new school and sees a young girl practicing [[high jump]] at the track field. 

He falls in love with her at first sight and does not expect to see her again. He soon discovers that the girl, Suzuka Asahina, is one of the occupants of his aunt's apartment. Because he pursues Suzuka, Yamato joins the [[track and field]] team in hopes of impressing her. Since joining the team, he discovers that he has the potential to become a top 100 meter sprinter. The story intertwines his pursuit of love and athletics.

== Characters ==
{{main|List of Suzuka Characters}}
The ''Suzuka'' series offers many unique and likeable characters, all who have different personalities, ranging from the serious Suzuka to the perverted Yashunobu, from the somewhat-crazy Yuuka to the completely crazy Megumi, ''Suzuka's'' Mr. Hyde.

== Anime ==
{{main|List of Suzuka episodes}}
The anime version features the voice talents of many new actors. There are 26 episodes released by Studio Comet, and runs a plot almost identical to the manga, except for some required changes, such as removing the constant nude shots in the manga. Likewise, while Yasunobu in the manga version thought he was being successful, the anime-version Yasunobu was able to understand his feelings. This accepting Yasunobu was portrayed more often in the anime, whereas in the manga, he usually gives perverted tips, although he is generally understanding. Another aspect left out were the many conversations that occurred in the baths, which were only shown in the manga. In addition, for probably a similar reason, the hole connecting Yamato's room with Suzuka's room was left out.
