'''"Glycerine"''' is the fourth single from [[post-grunge]] band [[Bush (band)|Bush]]'s debut album ''[[Sixteen Stone]]''. Bush had increasing popularity in the United States with the band's singles doing well on America. With the third single "[[Comedown (song)|Comedown]]," Bush reached number one on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart for two weeks. "Glycerine" did the same. It was also their biggest pop hit, peaking at number 28 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].
 
The video for "Glycerine" was notable for being shot in a very short time period when the band was on tour in the United States.  The video was shot so quickly because the band's visas had expired.  In spite of being very simple and unadorned, the video was highly acclaimed and won several awards, including the [[MTV Video Music Award - Viewer's Choice]] from the 1996 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

The song is also well known for being performed live, solo, by [[Gavin Rossdale]], during a heavy storm at the 1996 MTV Spring Break. Footage of the performance was put into video rotation by MTV.
