'''''Californication''''' is the seventh studio album by [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Released on June 8, 1999 (''see [[1999 in music]]'') on the [[Warner Music Group|Warner Bros.]] label, it saw [[John Frusciante]], who had previously appeared on ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' and ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'',  replace [[Dave Navarro]] as the band's guitarist. The album produced many hits for the band, including "[[Around the World (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Around the World]]", "[[Otherside]]", "[[Californication (song)|Californication]]" and [[Grammy]]-award winning "[[Scar Tissue]]". ''Californication'' is the Chili Peppers' best-selling album to date, reaching #3 on the US [[Billboard 200]] and selling more than 15 million copies worldwide.<ref name="billboard">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers album chart history|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Billboard}}</ref><ref name="bbc">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3864401.stm|title=Chili Peppers' album tops survey|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref> It marked a change in style for the Chili Peppers; Greg Tate of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine noted that "while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, ''Californication'' dares to be spiritual and epiphanal".<ref name="rsreview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/277669/californication|title=''Californication'' review|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Rolling Stone'' magazine|author=Greg Tate}}</ref>

The title ''Californication'' is sometimes mistaken as a [[portmanteau]] of "[[California]]" and "[[fornication]]". However, in an interview with [[MTV]] in 2000, band member [[Anthony Kiedis]] stated that it is a not a sexual reference and that "californication" is "the act of the world being affected and saturated by the art and the culture being born and raised in California".<ref name="mtvinterview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/c/chilisfeature99_1.jhtml|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: ''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=MTV}}</ref>

In [[March 2006]], the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums were made available to purchase on [[iTunes]].<ref name="itunesrelease">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002200299|title="The Red Hot Chili Peppers' catalog is now available digitally for the first time."|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Billboard|author=Jonathan Cohen}}</ref> Albums bought there included new previously unreleased tracks. The original tracks, unlike the bonus tracks, were not remastered.

==Critical recognition==

[[Image:John Frusciante Frankfurt3.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Guitarist [[John Frusciante]]'s return to the band influenced the stylistic changes.]]

With the return of [[John Frusciante]] playing [[guitar]], the Red Hot Chili Peppers managed to regain their critical acceptance after its less popular predecessor, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', and it has achieved a far greater commercial success worldwide.<ref name="sputnikmusic">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=356|title=''Californication'' review|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Sputnik Music|author=Ross Delaney}}</ref><ref name="billboard" />

"Scar Tissue" won a [[Grammy]] award for best rock song in [[2000 in music|2000]].<ref name="2000grammys">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/specials/2000/grammys/list.html|title=42nd Annual Grammy Awards nominations|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Over the years ''Californication'' has remained popular; in 2003, the album was ranked number 399 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]] and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for [[AOL Sessions]] that included "Californication" and "Scar Tissue".<ref name="aolsessions">{{Cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/red-hot-chili-peppers/5241/main|title=AOL Sessions|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=AOL Music}}</ref><ref name="rsgreatest">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6626238/399_californication|title=The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> The album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers, so much so that six of the fifteen songs on their ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album were taken from ''Californication''.<ref name="greasthitstracklisting">{{Cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Hits-Red-Chili-Peppers/dp/B0000C1733|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: Greatest Hits|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]]}}</ref>

The album has received criticism for what some perceive to be excessive compression and distortion in the process of digital remastering,<ref name="guardianquality">{{Cite web|url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/insideit/story/0,,1992466,00.html|title=How CDs are remastering the art of noise|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> and was the subject of an online petition with garnered over 1,000 signatures.<ref name="soundpetition">{{Cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com/RHCPWBCD/petition.html|title=Sound Quality petition|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Petition Online}}</ref>

==Musical and lyrical content==

The album was a change of style for the Chili Peppers. Although it still contained their "punk funk" trademark sound (such as "Purple Stain", "Get On Top", "I Like Dirt" and "Around the World"), it leaned towards more pop-oriented melodies (for example, "[[Scar Tissue]]" and "[[Otherside]]") and focused on songs rather than [[jam session|jams]].<ref name="rsgreatest" /> This change has been attributed by some to the return of Frusciante to the lineup.<ref name="music.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.music.com/release/californication/1/|title=''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=music.com|year=2004|author=Greg Prato}}</ref> 

His return came with a more experimental style;  one song in particular, "Emit Remmus", features a repeating guitar riff that was deliberately recorded backwards (hence the title "Emit Remmus", backwards for "Summer Time").<ref name="tv.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/red-hot-chili-peppers/person/4601/summary.html|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers trivia|accessdate=2007-04-27|publisher=tv.com}}</ref>

The main lyrical theme is that of the title – ''Californication''. That is, the album is about Californian culture; one critic noted that "Savior" managed to "suggest that Vegas is just a kiss away".<ref name="rsreview" /> The album is littered with references to drugs and [[Hollywood]].<ref name="eweekly">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64068,00.html|title=''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|year=1999|author=David Browne}}</ref>
