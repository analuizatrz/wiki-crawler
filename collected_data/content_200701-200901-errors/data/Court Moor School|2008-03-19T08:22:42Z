'''Court Moor School''' is one of two [[secondary school]]s in the town of [[Fleet, Hampshire|Fleet]], in [[Hampshire]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]]) for pupils aged 11-16. The school was awarded [[Science College]] status in 2004.

The school was last inspected by [[OFSTED]] in 2006, where it received a rating of "good" overall.

The [[Department for Education and Skills]] (DFES) recorded that in 2000 some 70% of all pupils leaving the school that year had attained five or more [[GCSE]]  A*-C results, well above the national average of 49%.  League tables for 2005, indicate that 76% of all pupils taking exams that year gained 5 or more A*-C results.  For GCSE and [[GNVQ]] attainment, the [[BBC]]'s league table for 2005 ranked the school 24th out of 85 in the area and for 2002, 857 of 3571 in England and Wales.

== History ==

The 15.7 acre site for the school was purchased in 1957 for Â£3,810 by [[Hampshire County Council]]. Fleet Secondary Modern School, the earliest school in the town, moved into the site in 1960 and reopened as Court Moor School on May 11. At the time, the school had only buildings, 500 students and 20 teachers. Court Moor became a comprehensive school in 1974 and is part of the Hart school district.<ref>http://www.court-moor.hants.sch.uk/prosp/b-govs.PDF</ref>

The school is adjacent to the [[Basingstoke Canal]] and part of its site is designated a nature conservation area. The school gate is narrow because it was originally intended to be the trade entrace. Local residents were worried about the consequences of having the intended main gate opening onto their estate and it was never widened. 

The school operates a strict policy on uniform, whereby pupils must be seen to be wearing it in its entirety when outside of classes. Boys of the school are obligated to wear ties, but girls are allowed to choose whether they wish to or not.

==Awards==
A pupil that shows dedication to a sport may be awarded their colours when they reach upper school (Years 10-11) . Colours come in three forms. The 1st stage is a Colours Commendation certificate. The 2nd stage is a Half-Colours certificate. The 3rd stage recognizes members of the school team with a sports team badge and, if the pupil is male, a colours tie. The tie is distinguished from the normal school tie by a green stripe that replaces the regular blue stripe.
