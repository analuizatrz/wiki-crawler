'''Tropical Storm Vamei''' (international designation: '''''0126''''', JTWC designation: '''''32W''''', sometimes called '''Typhoon Vamei'''; formerly had the alternate name '''Tropical Storm 05B''') was a [[Pacific typhoon|Pacific]] [[tropical cyclone]] that formed closer to the [[equator]] than any other tropical cyclone worldwide. The last storm of the [[2001 Pacific typhoon season]], Vamei developed on [[December 26]] at 1.4°&nbsp;[[Latitude|N]] in the [[South China Sea]]. It strengthened quickly and made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] along extreme southeastern [[Malaysia]]. Vamei rapidly dissipated over [[Sumatra]] on [[December 28]], and the remnants eventually re-organized in the North [[Indian Ocean]]. 

Though officially designated as a [[tropical cyclone#intensity classifications|tropical storm]], the intensity of Vamei is disputed; some agencies classify it as a [[tropical cyclone#intensity classifications|typhoon]], based on sustained winds of 140&nbsp;[[Kilometres per hour|km/h]] (85&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]]) and the appearance of an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]. The storm brought flooding and landslides to eastern [[Malaysia]], causing $3.6&nbsp;million in damage (2001&nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]], $4.2&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) and five deaths. The typhoon is named after a [[songbird]] with white feathers; contributed by [[Macau]],<ref name="gp"/> the name was [[List of retired Pacific typhoon names (JMA)|retired]] after its first and only usage.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Vamei 2001 track.png}}
On [[December 19]], a small low-level circulation was located along the northwest coastline of [[Borneo]]; at the same time a plume of cold air progressed southward through the [[South China Sea]] on the southeastern periphery of a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over the [[Far East]]. The vortex drifted southwestward, reaching open water by [[December 21]]. The northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation, and at the same time a portion of the air surge crossed the [[equator]]. The southerly flow turned eastward, then northward, and in combination with the northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex, resulting in rapid [[tropical cyclogenesis|development]] of the low-level circulation, just a short distance north of the equator.<ref name="nps">{{cite web|author=C.P. Chang, Ching-Hwang Liu, Hung-Chi Kuo|year=2003|title=Typhoon Vamei: An Equatorial Tropical Cyclone Formation|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School Department of Meteorology|accessdate=2008-03-07|url=http://www.weather.nps.navy.mil/cpchang/papers/vamei/vamei.htm}}</ref> By [[December 25]], an area of scattered [[convection]] persisted about 370&nbsp;km (230&nbsp;mi) east of [[Singapore]] within an area of low [[wind shear]], in association with the low-level circulation. Continuing slowly westward, the convection deepened and organized further,<ref name="gp">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2002|title=December 2001 Worldwide Tropical Weather Summary|accessdate=2008-03-07|url=http://www.australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2002/summ0112.htm}}</ref> and at 1200&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on [[December 26]] the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230&nbsp;km (145&nbsp;mi) east of Singapore, or 156&nbsp;km (97&nbsp;mi) north of the equator.<ref name="jma">{{cite web|author=Japan Meteorological Agency|title=Best Track for the 2001 Pacific typhoon season|accessdate=2008-03-07|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst2001.txt}}</ref> This was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near the equator.<ref name="nps"/>

The depression strengthened further and officially attained tropical storm status at 0000&nbsp;UTC on [[December 27]], based on the analysis by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA),<ref name="jma"/> though the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior. Shortly thereafter, an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] with a 39&nbsp;km (24&nbsp;mi) diameter became apparent on satellite imagery, along with [[squall#tropical cyclone|rainbands]] extending southward to the opposite side of the equator. At 0600&nbsp;UTC, the JMA first classified the system as Tropical Storm Vamei, about 65&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) northeast of Singapore,<ref name="gp"/> and the agency estimated the storm attained peak winds of 85&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph) at the same time.<ref name="jma"/> However, the JTWC upgraded Vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 140&nbsp;km/h (85&nbsp;mph), based on a [[United States Navy]] ship report from within the eye; a second ship reported wind gusts of 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph) in the southern portion of the eyewall. The storm was small and compact, with gales extending about 45&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) from its center. At about 0830&nbsp;UTC on [[December 27]], Vamei made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] approximately 60&nbsp;km (35&nbsp;mi) northeast of Singapore,<ref name="gp"/> in the southeastern portion of the [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] state of [[Johor]].<ref name="kjc">{{cite web|author=Malaysian Meteorological Department|title=Tropical Storm Vamei causes widespread floods in Johor|accessdate=2008-03-09|url=http://www.kjc.gov.my/people/research/webpages/sigwx/dis2701_e.htm}}</ref> Initially, the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Malaysia)|Malaysian Meteorological Department]] classified the cyclone as a tropical storm,<ref name="nst1220">{{cite news|work=New Straits Times (Malaysia)|date=2006-12-20|title=Change Welcomed|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref> though it was later re-assessed as a typhoon at landfall.<ref name="nst1114">{{cite news|author=Leong Chow Peng|date=2006-11-14|title=Typhoon Vamei a unique experience|work=New Straits Times (Malaysia)|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Vamei weakened quickly as it crossed the extreme southern portion of the Malay Peninsula, and late on [[December 27]] the JMA downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the [[Straits of Malacca]].<ref name="jma"/> The JTWC initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm, though the agency downgraded the storm to depression status as the center again approached land.<ref name="gp"/> Early on [[December 28]], Vamei moved ashore along northeastern [[Sumatra]], and at 0600&nbsp;UTC the JMA classified the storm as dissipated.<ref name="jma"/> However, convection persisted near the circulation over land, believed to have been caused by the process known as upper-level [[Deformation (meteorology)|diffluence]]. On [[December 29]], what was originally believed to be a separate system reached the southeastern [[Bay of Bengal]]. In a post-season re-evaluation, the JTWC classified the system as a continuation of Vamei, based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of Vamei crossed Sumatra without dissipating. Convection re-developed, and late on [[December 30]] the JTWC classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390&nbsp;km (245&nbsp;mi) west-southwest of the northwestern tip of Sumatra; initially, due to being treated as a separate system, it was classified as Tropical Cyclone&nbsp;05B. Vamei quickly developed good [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] and organization, though increased wind shear on [[December 31]] rapidly weakened the storm; by late that day, the center was exposed from the deep convection, and Vamei quickly dissipated.<ref name="gp"/>

===Unusual formation===
[[Image:Vamei TRMM.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission|TRMM]] image of Vamei near landfall]]
Vamei formed and reached tropical storm strength at 1.5º&nbsp;[[Latitude|N]], only 156&nbsp;km (97&nbsp;mi) from the equator.<ref name="jma"/> This broke the previous record of Typhoon Sarah in the [[1956 Pacific typhoon season]], which reached tropical storm strength at 2.2º&nbsp;N.<ref name="gp"/> Due to a lack of [[Coriolis effect]] near the equator, the formation of Vamei was previously considered impossible.<ref name="gp"/> However, a study by the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] indicated that the probability for a similar equatorial development was at least once every four centuries.<ref name="nps"/>

Vamei developed a vortex that appears every winter along the northwest coast of [[Borneo]] and is maintained by the interaction between [[monsoon|monsoonal winds]] and the local topography. Often, the vortex remains near the coastline, and in an analysis of 51&nbsp;winters, only six reported the vortex as being over the equatorial waters for four days or more. As the area in the South China Sea between Borneo and Singapore is only 665&nbsp;km (415&nbsp;mi) wide, a vortex needs to move slowly to develop. A persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days, which is needed to enhance the vortex, is present, on average, nine days each winter. The probability for a pre-existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10&ndash;30&nbsp;percent. Thus, the conditions which resulted in the formation of Vamei are believed to occur once every 100&ndash;400&nbsp;years.<ref name="nps"/>

==Preparations and impact==
[[Image:Vamei Radar.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Radar image of Vamei from {{USS|Carl Vinson|CVN-70}}]]
Four days prior to Vamei moving ashore, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD) issued storm advisories for potentially affected areas. Subsequently, the agency issued warnings for heavy rainfall, rough winds, and rough seas.<ref name="kjc"/> However, few citizens knew of the passage of the rare storm.<ref>{{cite news|author=Zahar A.|date=2006-05-01|title=Get your facts right first|work=New Straits Times (Malaysia)|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>

Offshore of Malaysia, two [[U.S. Navy]] ships in Vamei's eyewall were damaged by strong winds.<ref name="nps"/> Upon moving ashore, the storm brought [[storm surge]] damage to portions of southeastern [[Malaysia]].<ref name="NSF">{{cite news | title = Hurricanes at the Equator: "Impossible Perfect Storm" Observed | author = Cheryl Dybas | date = [[May 12]], [[2003]] | publisher = [[National Science Foundation]]  | format = press release | url = http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/03/tip030512.htm|accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref> Vamei brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to portions of [[Melaka]], [[Negeri Sembilan]], and [[Selangor]] as well as to [[Johor]], where rainfall reached over 200&nbsp;mm (8&nbsp;in) in [[Senai]]. Additionally, monsoonal moisture, influenced by the storm, produced moderate to heavy precipitation across various regions of peninsular Malaysia.<ref name="kjc"/> The passage of the cyclone resulted in flooding and mudslides, which forced the evacuation of more than 13,195&nbsp;people in Johor and [[Pahang]] states into 69&nbsp;shelters.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard H.

River flooding was also reported, as a result of the precipitation from Vamei as well as previous rainfall. Damage from the flooding was estimated at [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]]13.7&nbsp;million (2001&nbsp;[[Malaysian ringgit|MYR]], $3.6&nbsp;million 2001&nbsp;USD). About 40&nbsp;percent of the damage occurred to crops at a farm in [[Kota Tinggi]]. Moderate damage to transportation, education, and health-care facilities was also reported. The Malaysian government provided affected families up to RM5,000 (2001&nbsp;MYR, $1,300 2001&nbsp;USD) in assistance for food, clothing, and repairs.<ref name="vameidam"/> Vamei also brought heavy rainfall to [[Singapore]],<ref>{{cite web|author=T.Y.

In 2004, the name "Vamei" was retired and replaced with "Peipah", becoming the first retired name since the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] began naming Pacific typhoons in 2000. Vamei was one of two tropical cyclones in the current naming list that was retired without attaining typhoon status; the other was [[Tropical Storm Bilis]] in 2006.<ref name="2008wmo">{{cite web|author=Tropical Cyclone Programme|year=2008|title=Typhoon Committee Operational Manual - Meteorological Component|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2008-03-04|url=http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP-23EDITION2008.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=[[Hong Kong Observatory]]|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclones in 2006|accessdate=2008-03-04|url=http://www.weather.gov.hk/publica/tc/tc2006/english/section1.htm}}</ref>
