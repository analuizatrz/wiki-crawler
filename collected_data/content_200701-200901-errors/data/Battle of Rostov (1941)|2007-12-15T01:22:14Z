The '''Battle of Rostov''' ([[1941]]) was a battle of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] of [[World War II]], fought around [[Rostov-on-Don]] between the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Army Group South]], commanded by General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] South Front commanded by General [[Yakov Timofeyevich Cherevichenko]].

==Prelude==
After winning the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Battle of Kiev]] in September 1941, the German Army Group South pushed down from the [[Dniepr River|Dniepr]] to the [[Sea of Azov]] coast. [[Walther von Reichenau]]'s [[German 6th Army|6th Army]] [[First Battle of Khakov|captured Kharkov]]. [[Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel]]'s [[German 17th Army|17th Army]] marched through [[Poltava]] towards [[Voroshilovgrad]]. [[Erich von Manstein]]'s [[German 11th Army|11th Army]] moved into the [[Crimea]] and had taken control of all of the peninsula by autumn (except [[Sevastopol]], which held out until [[3 July]] [[1942]]).

[[Ewald von Kleist]]'s 1st Panzer Army drove down from Kiev and encircled Soviet troops at [[Melitopol]] in October, then drove east along the shore of the Sea of Azov toward [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]] at the mouth of the [[Don River, Russia|Don river]], the gateway to the [[Caucasus]].

==The battle==
On [[21 November]] the Germans took Rostov. However, the German lines were over-extended, and Kleist's warnings that his left flank was vulnerable and that his tanks were ineffective in the freezing weather were ignored. On [[27 November]] the [[Soviet 37th Army]], commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Anton Ivanovich Lopatin]], counterattacked the 1st Panzer Army's spearhead from the north, forcing them to pull out of the city. [[Adolf Hitler]] countermanded the retreat. When von Rundstedt refused to obey, Hitler sacked him. However, retreat was unavoidable, and the 1st Panzer Army was forced back to the [[Mius River]] at [[Taganrog]]. It was the first significant German withdrawal of the war.

==The Battle of Rostov in fiction==
[[Stuart M. Kaminsky]]'s character [[Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov]] fought in the Battle of Rostov as a young man.  He took out a German tank with a [[grenade]] and a lucky burst of gunfire from a looted German [[machine pistol]], but was badly wounded.  A doctor saved his leg, but the leg was badly injured enough to give Rostnikov his trademark limp.
