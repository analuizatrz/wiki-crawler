The '''Battle of Uhud''' ({{lang-ar|غزوة أحد}}) was fought on 23 March, [[625]],<ref name="W136"/> between a force from the small [[Muslim]] community of [[Medina]], in what is now north-western [[Arabia]], and a force from [[Mecca]], the town from which many of the Muslims had emigrated (''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]''). [[Mount Uhud]], the location of the battle, is near Medina. The Battle of Uhud was the second military encounter between the Meccans and the Muslims, preceded by the [[Battle of Badr]] in [[624]], where a small Muslim army had defeated the larger Meccan army.

The Muslims had the worst of the affair and retired after having lost some seventy-five men. However, the Meccans did not pursue the Muslims into Medina, but marched back to Mecca. The battle is generally regarded as a victory for the Meccans and a serious setback for the Muslims. Some scholars disagree, stating that while the Muslims did not win, the Meccans had embarked on the venture aiming to subdue the Muslims entirely, which they failed to achieve.<ref name="CHI">Cambridge History of Islam 1A (1977) pp. 47-48</ref>

== Prelude == 
[[Muhammad]] had preached the religion of [[Islam]] in Mecca from [[613]] to [[622]]. He had attracted a small, tight-knit community of followers, but had also succeeded in angering the rest of the [[Quraysh]], the clan that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. After years of persecution, the Muslims fled Mecca in 622 and established themselves at Medina. They considered themselves to be in a state of war with Mecca and raided Meccan caravans.{{clarifyme|date=June 2007}}<!--For what reason they think so--> The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and stop their raiding. At the [[Battle of Badr]] in 624, a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army.<ref>Peters (1994) pp. 211—214</ref> 

Many Muslims considered this unexpected victory a proof that they had been favored by God ([[Allah]]), and believed they were assured such victories in the future.<ref name="W1423">Watt (1964) pp. 142—143</ref> A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr, and so leadership passed to [[Abu Sufyan]]. He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr, for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad, promising to conduct a raid on the city of Medina. Several months later, Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city, obtaining temporary residence with the chief of a [[Jewish]] tribe and learning more of the current situation in Medina. He then left the city, burning two houses and laying waste to some fields in fulfillment of his vow. Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter.<ref>Watt (1964) pp. 132—135</ref>

== The Meccan force sets out == 
Defeat by the Muslims the Battle of Badr had infuriated the Meccans, who now wanted revenge for their dead kinsmen. The following year on 11 March 625 with Abu Sufyan at the helm, they raised another force, often numbered at 3000, and set out for the Muslim base in Medina. Rather than attacking Medina itself, which was populated by numerous strongholds that would have required long sieges to overcome, they camped on the pastures north of the city, hoping that the Muslims would come out to meet them.<ref name="Uhud">"Uhud", ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''</ref><ref>Watt (1964) p. 135</ref> According to the early Muslim historian [[Ibn Ishaq]], a number of Meccan women are said to have accompanied Abu Sufyan's army to provide vocal support, including [[Hind bint Utbah]], his wife.<ref>Guillaume 813</ref>
[[Image:Battle of Auhad.gif|200px|thumb|right|Map of the battle, showing the Muslim and Meccan lines respectively.]]
Muhammad soon learned of the Meccan army's presence and numbers through a scout late on Thursday. The next morning, at the Muslim conference of war, there was dispute over how best to repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many of the senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.<ref name="Uhud" /><ref name="W137">Watt (1964) p. 137</ref> 

== The battle == 
===Separation of Ibn Ubayy===
A group of approximately 1000 men set out on late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, they took a position on the lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, '[[Abdullah ibn Ubayy]] (the chief of the [[Khazraj]] tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the [[Qur'an]] for this act.<ref name="W137" />

===First stage:Initial Muslim's success===
The Meccan forces lay between the Muslim forces and the center of Medina. The Meccans attacked, but their initial charge was driven back by Muslim [[archer]]s. The Muslims, enjoying the best of the early encounters, surged forward, with victory appearing certain. The detachment of archers had previously been posted on a hill to defend an extremity of the Muslim flank; however, this force disobeyed its initial orders and ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.<ref name="Uhud" /><ref name="W89">Watt (1964) pp. 138-139</ref>

===Second stage:Khalid's raid ===
At this critical juncture, a Meccan cavalry led by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] exploited this move by the Muslim archers, and attacked their remnants still positioned on the hill. From here, they were then able to target and overrun the Muslim flank and rear. Confusion ensued, and numerous Muslims were killed. In the midst of this, rumors had circulated that Muhammad too had perished. It emerged, however, that Muhammad had not been killed, only wounded.<ref name="Uhud" /><ref name="W89" />

[[Image:The Message - Uhud archers.png|200px|thumb|right|Muslim archers positioned on a hill during the Battle of Uhud, as depicted in Moustapha Akkad's 1976 film "''The Message''."]]
After fierce hand-to-hand combat, most of the Muslims managed to withdraw and regroup higher up on the slopes of Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of [[Hamza ibn 'Abdul Muttalib|Hamza]], Muhammad's uncle, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat.<ref>Ibn Ishaq (1955) 380—388, cited in Peters (1994) p. 218</ref>

===Third stage:Withdrew of Mecca army===
Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] (a companion of Muhammad) decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.<ref name="Uhud" /><ref name="W89" />

Ibn Ishaq records this exchange as follows<ref>cf. Ibn Ishaq (1955) 380—388, cited in Peters (1994) p. 219</ref>:
<blockquote>"''When (the Quraysh leader) Abu Sufyan wanted to leave, he went to the top of the mountain and shouted loudly, saying, "You have done a fine work. Victory in war goes by turns: today is in exchange for the day of Badr. Show your superiority, Hubal," that is, vindicate your religion. The Messenger told Umar to go up and answer him and say, "God is most high and most glorious. We are not equal: our dead are in paradise, yours are in hell." At this answer Abu Sufyan said to Umar, "Come up here to me." The Messenger told him to go and see what Abu Sufyan was up to. When he came Abu Sufyan said, "I adjure you by God, Umar, have we killed Muhammad?""By God, you have not, he is listening to what you are saying right now," Umar replied. Abu Sufyan said, "I regard you as more truthful and reliable than Ibn Qami'a," referring to the latter's claim that he had killed Muhammad.''"</blockquote>

===The result===
The battle is generally believed by scholars to be a defeat for the Muslims, as they had incurred significantly more losses than the Meccans. Chase F. Robinson, writing in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', states the notion that "the Muslims suffered a disheartening defeat is clear enough."<ref name="Uhud" /> Other scholars such as [[Montgomery Watt]] disagree, noting that while the Muslims did not win, the Meccans had failed to achieve their strategic aim of destroying Muhammad and his followers; and that the Meccans' untimely withdrawal indicated weakness on their part.<ref name="CHI"/> The battle is also noted for the emergence of the military leadership and tactical military genius of Khalid ibn al-Walid, who would later become the most famous of all Arab generals during the Islamic expansion era, in conquering the [[Sassanid Empire]].<ref>See:

== Aftermath == 

Muhammad and the Muslims buried the dead on the battlefield, returning home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening at a place called ''Hamra al-Asad'', a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harry the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.<ref>See:
* Watt (1981) p. 432;
* An early Muslim historian, [[al-Waqidi]], records [[Amr ibn al-A'as]] (a Meccan commander) as saying: "''When we renewed the attack against them, we smote a certain number of them, and they scattered in every direction, but later a party of them rallied. Quraysh then took counsel together and said, The victory is ours, let us depart. For we had heard that [[Abdallah ibn Ubayy|Ibn Ubayy]] had retired with a third of the force, and some of the Aws and the Khazraj had stayed away from the battle, and we were not sure that they would not attack us. Moreover we had a number of wounded, and all our horses had been wounded by the arrows. So they set off. We had not reached ar-Rawha until a number of them came against us and we continued on our way.''", ibid.</ref>

===Muslim reaction===
For the Muslims, the battle held a religious dimension as well as a military one. They had expected another victory like at Badr, which was considered a sign of God's favor upon them. At Uhud, however, they had barely held off the invaders and had lost a great many men. A verse of the Qur'an revealed soon after the battle cited the Muslims' disobedience and desire for loot as the cause for this setback:<ref name="CHI"/><ref name="W144">Watt(1964) p. 144</ref> 

{{cite quran|3|152|expand=no|translator=y|quote=''Allah did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission were about to annihilate your enemy,-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the booty) which ye covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but He forgave you: For Allah is full of grace to those who believe''}}

According to the Qur'an, then, the misfortunes at Uhud— largely the result of the rear guard abandoning their position in order to seek booty— were partly a punishment and partly a test for steadfastness.<ref name="W144"/>

===Further conflict===
Abu Sufyan, whose position as leader was no longer undisputed, set about forging alliances with surrounding [[nomad]]ic tribes in order build up strength for another advance on Medina. The success of the Meccans' rousing of tribes against Muhammad reaped disastrous consequences for him and the Muslims with two main losses: one was where a Muslim party had been invited by a chieftan of the Ma'unah tribe, who were then killed as they approached by the tribe of Sulaym; while the other was when the Muslims had sent out instructors to a tribe which stated it wanted to convert to Islam — the instructors had been led into an ambush by the guides of the would-be Muslim tribe, and were subsequently killed.<ref>Watt (1964) pp. 147—148</ref> Soon thereafter, Muhammad became convinced that the Jewish tribe [[Banu Nadir]] harbored enmity towards him and were plotting to kill him. The Banu Nadir were expelled from Medina after a fifteen-day seige, with some relocating to the oasis of [[Khaybar]] and others to [[Syria]].<ref>Nadir, Banu-l. ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online</ref> Abu Sufyan, along with the allied confederate tribes, would attack Medina in the [[Battle of the Trench]], two years after the events at Uhud (in [[627]]).<ref name="CHI"/>

== The historical record ==
Most of the information available about the events is derived from the ''[[sira]]—[[maghazi]]'' traditions (biographical narratves and documentation of military campaigns) of the early centures of Islam. The general sequence of the events gained consensus early on, as demonstrated in the text of [[Ibn Ishaq]], an early biographer of Muhammad. Accounts of the battle are derived mainly from descendants of the participants. Much of the basic narrative and chronology, according to Robinson, is reasonably authentic, although some of the more elaborate details — such as the exact scale of the Muslim defeat —  may be doubtful or difficult to ascertain.<ref name="Uhud"/>

For the early Muslims, it was certain that there were verses of the Qur'an referring to this event, and Muslim exegetes identified areas echoing the battle or lessons of Uhud. According to Ibn Ishaq, the Qur'anic chapter ''[[Al-Imran|āl-Imrān]]'' contains 60 verses, "in which there is a description of their battle, and blame for those who he rebuked." Other verses have also been connected to the battle by exegetes, such as 33:23. Robinson, citing the judgement that Uhud was a trial for the Muslim community, concludes that the "Uhud accounts both narrated history and taught enduring lessons, perhaps especially to those Muslims familiar with the [[First Fitna|first fitna]]."<ref name="Uhud"/>
