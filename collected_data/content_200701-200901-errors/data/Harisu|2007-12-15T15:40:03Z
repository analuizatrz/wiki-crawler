'''Harisu''' ([[Hangul]]: 하리수; [[Traditional Chinese|Chinese]]: 河莉秀) is the [[stage name]] of '''Lee Kyung-eun''' (born '''Lee Kyung-yup''', [[February 17]], [[1975]]), a [[transsexual]] [[pop singer]], [[Model (person)|model]] and [[actress]] from [[South Korea]]. Despite being born male, she [[Gender identity|identified]] as female from early childhood, and underwent [[Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female|sex reassignment surgery]] in the 1990s. She is noted for being South Korea's first [[transgender]] entertainer, and in 2002 became only the second person in Korea to [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|legally change their gender]]. Her stage name is an adaptation of the [[English language|English]] phrase "hot issue".

Harisu first gained public attention in 2001, after appearing in a [[television commercial]] for DoDo [[cosmetics]]. The commercial was a big success and ended up launching her career, allowing her to branch out into other fields such as music and acting. So far she has recorded five [[Korean language|Korean]] musical [[album]]s, switching [[Music genre|genres]] between [[techno]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], and her overseas releases have featured songs recorded in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. Her first major acting role was in the 2001 film ''[[Yellow Hair 2]]'', and since then her credits have included ''[[Hi! Honey]]'', a [[Taiwanese drama]] series, and ''[[Colour Blossoms]]'', an erotic drama by [[Hong Kong]] [[filmmaker]] Yonfan.

On [[May 19]], [[2007]], Harisu married boyfriend Micky Jung, whom she had been dating for two years previously.

== Career ==
=== Debut ===
[[Image:Harisu DoDo commercial.jpg|thumb|right|Harisu first gained public attention when she appeared in this TV commercial for DoDo cosmetics. Note the [[Adam's apple]], which was added digitally.]]
Harisu made her acting debut in 1991—while still a boy—as a [[supporting actor]] in a high school [[TV drama]] series,<ref name="10 Minutes With Harisu" /> and this was followed by other minor film and TV roles as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]] during the 1990s.<ref name="South Korea Loosens Its Collar" />

Her big break came in early 2001, when she appeared in a [[TV commercial]] for DoDo [[cosmetics]]. The commercial hinted at the fact she is a transsexual, zooming in to reveal her [[Adam's apple]] (although this was added digitally, since Harisu herself does not have a prominent Adam's apple).<ref name="Makeup Ad Features First Transsexual on TV" /><ref name="Harisu Superstar" /> DoDo were initially cautious about using the commercial, and had been prepared to withdraw it if the response was negative, but it turned out to be a big success and quickly established her as a celebrity. As South Korea's first transgender entertainer, there was a great deal of media interest in Harisu, and she was routinely described as being "more beautiful than a woman".<ref name="Harisu Superstar" /><ref name="Harisu Redefines Gender Identity" /> Explaining her reasons for "[[coming out]]", she said, "I don't want to face people dishonestly. I won't be able to hide it after all. It's better to make it clear from the start."<ref name="Harisu Redefines Gender Identity">Park Soo-in, [http://search.hankooki.com/times/times_view.php?term=harisu+harisu++&path=hankooki1/kt_culture/200106/t2001062817032846110.htm&media=kt "Harisu Redefines Gender Identity"], ''The Korea Times'', [[June 28]], [[2001]]. Retrieved on [[May 6]], [[2007]].</ref> In June 2001, Harisu was the subject of a [[television documentary]] produced by [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], which covered her childhood, family relationships, and debut as an entertainer.<ref name="Ha Ri-Soo, Who Became a Woman: Story Behind" />

Later that year she was cast in the film ''[[Yellow Hair 2]]'', her first leading role. In addition to contributing songs for the films [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack]], Harisu played a transsexual who goes on the run after the apparent death of a [[convenience store]] owner. Regarding her decision to appear in the film, she said, "I wanted to break the stereotype of transsexuals — the demureness and extreme weakness with which they are often portrayed."<ref name="Transsexual entertainer testing the boundaries of South Koreans' Confucian ideals" /> The film was released on [[July 21]].

Also in 2001, Harisu published her [[autobiography]], ''Eve from Adam'', and appeared in a [[music video]] for dance group [[Turbo (group)|Turbo]]. In September, she entered the [[K-pop]] music scene with her debut album, ''[[Temptation (Harisu album)|Temptation]]'', a mix of [[techno]]-style [[pop music]] and [[Ballad (music)|slow ballads]], which peaked at number 32 on the MIAK (Music Industry Association of Korea) K-pop albums chart.<ref name="MIAK 09/01" /> She released her second album, ''[[Liar (Harisu album)|Liar]]'', in October 2002, describing it as "a high-energy dance record with a very upbeat rhythm."<ref name="Harisu Superstar" /> ''Liar'' became her biggest domestic chart success, reaching number 23 in its first month of release.<ref name="MIAK 10/02" />

=== 2003–2005 ===
In October 2003, Harisu made the decision to leave her management company, TTM Entertainment. However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists.<ref name="Who is the Real 'Hot Issue'?" /> The matter was taken to [[court]], and in early 2004 the [[Court ruling|ruling]] went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G&F Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career.<ref name="Harisu: Woman Revealed">Krista Kim, "Harisu: Woman Revealed", ''The Korea Herald'', [[February 11]], [[2004]].

In 2004, Harisu began to develop her career overseas, expressing frustration at being "pigeon-holed" as a transsexual in Korea. She starred in the [[Taiwanese drama]] series ''[[Hi! Honey]]'' alongside local celebrity Pace Wu, despite not being fluent in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] (her lines were spoken in [[Korean language|Korean]] and later [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]]).<ref name="Harisu: Woman Revealed" /> She drew attention by promoting [[sanitary napkin]]s in a series of [[advertisement]]s for Taiwanese company UFT, for which she was paid an estimated [[South Korean won|₩]]100 million per ad. Although she had been initially reluctant to take on the project, observers hailed the casting of a [[transwoman]] in such a campaign as a sign of progress.<ref name="Transgender Singer to Do Menstrual Pad Ads">Hwang Su-cheol, [http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200404/200404130027.html "Transgender Singer to Do Menstrual Pad Ads"], ''Digital Chosunilbo'', [[April 13]], [[2004]].

After a prolonged absence from the Korean music scene, Harisu returned in January 2006 with her fourth, [[self-titled]] album. Although her comeback was originally scheduled for the summer of 2005, this had been prevented by other commitments overseas.
