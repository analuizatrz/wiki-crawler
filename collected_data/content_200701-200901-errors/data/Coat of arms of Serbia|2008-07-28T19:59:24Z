The '''Coat of Arms of [[Serbia]]''' is the same as the [[coat of arms]] of the former [[House of Obrenović|Obrenović]] dynasty (first adopted in [[1882]]; re-adopted in 2004) and features the white [[bicephalic eagle]] of the [[House of Nemanjić]] (which in turn took on the eagle from the  [[Palaiologos]] dynasty of the [[Byzantine Empire]]). An [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] cape of the style once worn by kings is featured in the background. The double-headed eagle has been used since Byzantine times, the Serbian cross has been used since the 12th century. It is commonly known as '''kokarda'''.

==Design==

The principal field stands for the Serbian State. It consists of a double-headed eagle on a red shield; its body and wings in silver, and tongues, beaks, legs and claws in gold, between two golden [[fleurs-de-lys]]. The [[inescutcheon]] stands for the Serbian Nation; in a red shield, a cross between four silver [[firesteel]]s arranged in the quarters around it, all of them facing horizontally outwards.

A [[blazon]] in heraldic terms is: ''Gules, a bicephalic eagle Argent armed Or, two fleurs-de-lys Or. Overall an escutcheon Gules, a cross Argent between four firesteels Argent. All crowned with a royal crown.''
The design on the inescutcheon has been used by Serbian states and the Serbian church since the Middle Ages.

Although Serbia is now a [[republic]], the new coat of arms also features the crown of the former [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian monarchy]]. A crown in this manner usually signifies a monarchial form of government. However in recent years several Eastern European nations have used a crown to signify their royal heritage. [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] have similarly both restored coat of arms bearing crowns despite being republics.

==The socialist coat of arms==

After the end of [[World War II]], the new socialist government redesigned the coat of arms, turning it into an example of the arms style used in the [[Soviet Union]] and post-war Eastern Europe. 

The wheat represented peasants and the cogwheel at the bottom represented workers. The red star at the top symbolised communism, the sun with rays represented a new morning. Oak is traditionally a sacred tree for Serbs, hence the oak leaves and acorns.
The years 1804 and 1941 on the red ribbon commemorate the [[First Serbian Uprising]] and the beginning of National liberation struggle against Axis occupiers in the Second World war.

The coat of arms featured a shield with the traditional Serbian emblem, but since the socialist government was officially [[atheist]], the cross, which represents [[Christianity]], was omitted. 

The socialist coat of arms remained in official use long after the break-up of socialist Yugoslavia due to the republic's continued governance of the former communist establishment within the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] and after the red star was removed from [[flag of Serbia|the flag]].
