==History==
Kearny Street was originally named "La Calle de la Fundacion" by the Spanish.  Translated, this means "street of the foundation."  The origin of the present name, Kearny Street, is generally assumed to be [[Stephen Watts Kearny]], the first military governor of California under U.S. rule.<ref name="etymology">{{cite web

At Kearny and Clay, the first [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]] in America, invented by [[Andrew S. Hallidie]], on [[August 2]], [[1873]], climbed five blocks up the Clay Street hill.

From the turn of the twentieth century until 1977, the area around the intersection of Kearny and Jackson Streets was home to a large Filipino population, and earned the nickname [[Manilatown]].  Located at 848 Kearny Street, the [[I-Hotel|International Hotel]] served as the heart of Manilatown.  In its heyday of the 1920s and 1930s, the estimated population of Manilatown was between 20,000 and 40,000 people.

After a protracted court battle, the remaining two hundred odd tenants were forcibly evicted on 4 August 1977.  On 27 July 2004, a two block stretch of Kearny St. was officially declared to be Manilatown.
