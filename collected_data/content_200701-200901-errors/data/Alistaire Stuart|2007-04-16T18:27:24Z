'''Alistaire Stuart''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a scientist, an ally of the [[superhero]] team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] and head of MI-13, an intelligence agency. He first appeared in ''Excalibur'' #6 and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Alan Davis]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Doctor Alistaire Stuart''' and his sister, brigadier [[Alysande Stuart]] are the founders of the Weird Happenings Organisation (W.H.O.). The W.H.O. is a British intelligence agency to investigate paranormal and superhuman activity and combat any superhuman threats by combining Alistaire's scientific knowledge with Alysande's military skills. 

While investigating the disappearance of doctor [[Moira MacTaggert]] and the appearance of a Moira MacTaggert from a  [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], Alistaire meets [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]], a member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], who is attracted to Alistaire. Kitty introduces Alistaire to Excalibur and to her disappointment, Alistaire is more interested in Kitty's friend [[Rachel Summers]]. Alistaire, Alysande and the W.H.O. become loyal allies to Excalibur and Alistaire accompanies the team during their journey across parallel universes known as the ''Cross-Time Caper''. 

Some time after their return, Alysande is accused of selling classified information to 
[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], but she dies before the investigation is complete. S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury]] meets Alistaire at the funeral and tells him that his sister was framed. Alistaire investigates the matter and finds out that the [[R.C.X.]], another government agency, framed Alysande so that W.H.O. is weakened and the R.C.X. can take control of its resources. With the help of Excalibur the R.C.X. is defeated. 

Shortly afterwards, another intelligence agency, [[Black Air]] begins its rise to power. Black Air competes with the R.C.X. and W.H.O., often with violence. As leader of the W.H.O., Alistaire knows too much about Black Air and is targeted by them for assassination. He flees the country and travels to the United States. There, he makes his way to the [[X-Mansion]] and asks the [[X-Men]] to contact Excalibur. Meanwhile, Excalibur has had its own problems with Black Air and promises to bring Alistaire home. Excalibur uses the information they have gathered on Black Air to expose Black Air's crimes and Black Air is forced underground. Alistaire Stuart is appointed head of a new department to replace W.H.O., Black Air and the R.C.X. This new department is known as MI-13 or simply "the Department".

As of March 2007, Alistaire Stuart has a supporting role in the miniseries Wisdom, which features British non-superhero [[Pete Wisdom]]. Though it has not been explained why, Stuart now appears to be a very old man.
