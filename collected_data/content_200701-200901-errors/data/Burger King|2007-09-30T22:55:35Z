===History===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BurgerKingOriginal.jpg|thumb|right|An original 1950s Burger King in [[Naperville, Illinois]].]] -->

Burger King's first restaurant, originally called '''Insta Burger King''', was opened on [[December 4]], [[1954]] in a suburb of [[Miami, Florida]], [[United States|USA]] by [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]], who were both alumni of the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]]. McLamore had visited the hamburger stand belonging to [[Dick and Mac McDonald]] in [[San Bernardino, California]]; being able to sense potential in their innovative [[assembly line]]-based production system, he decided to create a version of his own. By 1959, BK had grown to five regional stores in and around the metropolitan Miami area. About this time, Messrs McLamore and Edgerton decided to expand BK nationally by using a franchising system that had become a popular method for expansion due to its low capital cost for the parent company. They formed Burger King Corporation as the parent and began selling territorial franchise licenses to private owners across the US.<ref name="answers">[http://www.answers.com/topic/burger-king History of Burger King Corporation] Answers.com</ref>
[[Image:Burgerkingrestaurant.jpg|thumb|right|A Burger King restaurant in [[Redwood City, California]]]]
In 1967, after eight years of private operation, the [[Pillsbury Company]] acquired Burger King and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time of the purchase, BK had grown to 274 different restaurants in the United States. While BK began its foray in to locations outside of the [[continental United States]] in 1963 with a store in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], it did not have a large international presence. This situation changed shortly after the acquisition when Pillsbury began BK's global expansion with its first international restaurant in [[Canada]] in 1969. Other international locations followed soon after: [[Oceania]] in 1971 with Hungry Jack's and the first [[Europe]]an restaurant located in [[Madrid, Spain]], in 1975. Beginning in 1982, BK and its franchisees began operating stores in several [[East Asian]] countries, including [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and [[Korea]]<ref name="answers"/>. Due to high competition, many of the Japanese locations closed by the end of 2001. BK reentered the Japanese market in mid-2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/news/story.phtml?id=5523 |title=Burger King back in Japan after 6 years |author=Yuri Kageyama |publisher=QSR Magazine |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref>. BKs [[Central American|Central]] and [[South American]] operation started in [[Mexico]] in [[date]].<ref name="answers"/>

Since the time that Pillsbury bought Burger King, BK has been the object of a series of failed and successful acquisitions and divestitures. In 1973, Chart House, owner of 350 restaurants at the time and one of BK's largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100 million ([[USD]]). When Chart House's bid failed, its owners, Billy and Jimmy Trotter, suggested that Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective Burger King holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company, an offer Pillsbury also declined. After the failed attempts to acquire BK, the relationship between Chart House and the Trotters began to sour; in 1979 BK successfully sued Chart House for improperly acquiring locations in Boston and Houston<ref name="answers"/>. In [[1984]], Pillsbury purchased Chart House's successor, DiversiFoods, for $390 million ([[USD]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v19/ai_3930610 |title=How Pillsbury 'stole' DiversiFoods for just $390 million |author=Rick Telberg |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=1985-09-09 |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> after a separate,  independent $525 million management-backed leveraged buy-out of the company failed<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02EFDA1238F931A25751C1A962948260 |title=DiversiFoods Net |publisher=New York Times |date=1984-12-12 |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref>.

In 1989, under the ownership of Grand Met, Burger King acquired many locations of its major [[UK]] rival [[Wimpy Bar|Wimpy]] when the parent company bought the Wimpy's brand from its previous owner [[United Biscuits]] and re-branded them as Burger King, giving it an even greater presence in that country. While other "Wimpy" locations are still in operation presently, they are now independent from BK and no longer have the presence they once did<ref name="answers"/>. In 1997, Grand Metropolitan merged with [[Guinness]] to form a company called [[Diageo]]. Diageo maintained ownership of BKC until 2001 when Diageo decided to focus solely on their beverage products and put BK up for sale.

In 2002, a [[triumvirate|troika]] of [[private equity]] firms led by [[Texas Pacific Group]] with associates [[Bain Capital]] and [[Goldman Sachs Capital Partners]] agreed to purchase BK from Diageo for $1.5 billion ([[USD]]),<ref name="answers"/> with the sale becoming complete in December of that year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1113/p01s01-usec.html|title=Are private buyouts good for the economy?|author=By Mark Trumbull|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=[[13 November]] [[2006]]}}</ref>.

Although the investment group initially planned to take BK public within the two years of the acquisition, this was delayed until 2006. On [[February 1]], [[2006]], CEO [[Greg Brenneman]] announced TPG's plans to turn Burger King into a publicly traded company by issuing an [[Initial public offering|Initial Public Offering]]. On February 16, the company announced it had filed its registration for the IPO with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. On [[May 18]], [[2006]], Burger King began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker symbol BKC and generating $425 million in revenue, the largest IPO of a US-based restaurant chain on record.<ref name="bkust">{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2006-05-18-bk-ipo_x.htm |title=Burger King's IPO declared 'a success' |author=Matt Krantz |publisher=USA Today |date=2006-05-19 |accessdate=2007-09-30 }}</ref>

Burger King Holdings is the parent company of Burger King, in the [[US]] it operates under the Burger King Brands title while internationally it operates under the Burger King Corporation banner. It is a publicly traded company with investment firms of Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs each owning about 25% of the company.<ref name="2006report">[http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/87/87140/BKCAR2006.pdf BKC 2006 Annual Report]</ref> Its headquarters are located in a suburban Miami area that is part of an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] section of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]. 

Burger King is the second largest [[chain store|chain]] of [[hamburger]] [[fast food]] restaurants in the world behind industry bellwether [[McDonald's]] (31,000 locations)<ref name="mcds">{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/mcdonald's/--ID__10974--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml |title=McDonald's Corporation |author=Hoovers.com |publisher=Hoovers.com |date= |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> and the third largest chain overall after [[Yum!

Brands, Inc. |author=Hoovers.com |publisher=Hoovers.com |date= |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> and McDonald's. Historically, Burger King has been the second largest burger chain in North America, behind [[McDonald's]]. However, Burger King's revenues and market share have been declining. In the early 2000s, Burger King fell to a near tie for second place with [[Wendy's]]. Burger King has been closing under-performing stores and changing its marketing strategy in an attempt to turn its fortunes around. In fiscal year 2002, the firm had [[United States dollar|US $]]11.3 billion in total sales. As of 2006, there are more than 11,220 Burger King outlets in 61 countries. 66% of the restaurants are in the United States. The company has more than 340,000 employees who serve approximately 11.4 million customers daily.<ref name="2006report"/> 

Almost 90% of Burger King restaurants are privately owned and operated, or [[franchising|franchised]]. While Burger King Corporation sets standards for exterior store appearance, food quality and menu, individual owners have control over hours of operations, interior decor, pricing and staff uniforms and wages. For example, [[Magic Johnson]]'s company [[Magic Johnson Enterprises]] purchased 30 Burger King stores on [[June 7]], [[2004]]. The stores were redecorated with a sports memorabilia theme. These locations officially reopened on [[December 3]], [[2004]].<ref name="2006report"/>

Burger King has a longstanding presence at [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] installations worldwide, dating back to the 1980s under a contract with [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]]. Today, while other chains such as [[Taco Bell]], [[Popeye's]] and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] have a presence on military bases, virtually every major Army and Air Force installation hosts a BK restaurant. 
Many Burger King outlets, even inside cities, require customers to operate a motor vehicle to purchase food during late evening hours.<ref name="2006report"/>

===Controversies, disputes and legal issues===

====Trademark disputes====
As it expanded in the Burger King found that smaller operations had previously been using the name. The two major examples occurred in [[Mattoon, Illinois]] and Australia.

The Mattoon trademark dispute is probably the most important of the diputes because of the effect it had setting [[legal precedent]] in regards to the [[Lanham Act]] in the US under the case ''Burger King of Florida, Inc. v. Hoots (1968)''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uconn.edu/homes/swilf/ip/cases/burger.htm |title=Burger King of Florida, Inc. v. Hoots (1968) |author=Judge Kiley |coauthor=Judges Cummings and Kerner |publisher=United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit |date=1968-11-25 |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref> Gene and Betty Hoots owned an [[ice cream]] shop in the city of Mittoon; due to the success of the store, in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop next to the original location. In keeping with the name of the ice cream shop, ''Frigid Queen'', they named their burger stand ''Burger King'' and registered their [[trademark]] with the [[state of Illinois]] in 1959.<ref name="hoots">{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoistimes.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A2686 |title=The burger king and queen of Mattoon |author=John Jermaine |publisher=the Illinois Times |date=2003-11-20 |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref>

Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening locations in Illinois in 1961, and by 1967 had over twenty locations in areas in the state. The Hootses, believing that their trademark gave them exclusive rights to the name in Illinois sued state and later federal court. The decision of the federal court was that the BKC federal trademark, received in 1963, took precedence over the Hootses' state trademark; The Hootses were granted exclusive rights to the Burger King trade mark in 20 mile (32 Km) of their original location in Mattoon.<ref name="hoots"/>

{{details|Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)}}

When Burger King decided to expand its operations into [[Australia]], it found that its business name was already [[trademark]]ed by a man running a small takeaway food shop in [[Queensland]]. As a result, Burger King provided the Australian franchisee, [[Jack Cowin]], with a list of possible alternative names that the Australian Burger King restaurants could be branded as. The names were derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury. Cowin selected the "Hungry Jack" brand name, one of Pillsbury's US [[pancake]] mixture products, and slightly changing the name to a [[possessive form]] by adding an [[apostrophe#Possessive apostrophe|apostrophe]] '[[s]]' thus forming the new name '''Hungry Jack's'''. Accordingly, the first Australian franchise of the Burger King Corporation, established in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1971, was branded as Hungry Jack's.<ref name="bkcau>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/eating-drinking-places/4275422-1.html |title=Burger King Re-flags Australian Stores |author=Restaurant Business News |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2007-09-29 }}</ref>

====Controversies====
{{section-stub}}
Like with other large [[multi-national corporation]]s, Burger King has had it share of controversies and legal issues over the course of its existence. As the company grew it encountered several issues in regards to [[trademarks]], the most famous one occurred with the similarly named [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)|Burger King in Mattoon, Illinois]]. Serious issues with the Islamic community have arisen over cultural sensitivities and an [[Israel|Israeli]] franchise opening stores in [[Israeli-occupied territories|the Occupied territories]]. Additionally, several groups have cited BK as having contributed to the western [[obesity]] epidemic by introducing products that contain large amounts of [[fat]], [[trans-fat]] and calories. Like many of its competitors, BK has also been targeted by various animal welfare groups, such as [[PETA]], over the treatment of the animals it uses in the production its products.

In recent years, BK has begun introducing several large over-sized products including its European [[BK XXL]] line, [[Enormous Omelet Sandwich]] line and the [[BK Stacker]] line. These products, and others like them, have brought international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.komoradio.com/news/archive/4191016.html |title=Burger King Launches Line Of Jumbo High-Rise Burgers |author=Herb Weisbaum |publisher=KOMO Radio ([[Seattle, WA]]) |date=2006-07-06}}</ref>, amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2005-03-27-burger-king_x.htm | title=Burger King to offer whopper of a breakfast sandwich |author=Bruce Horovitz |publisher=USA TODAY |date=2005-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/blogs/healthbeat/archive.asp?postID=761 |title=Word of the day: Meat'Normous |publisher=the Spokesman Review ([[Spokane, WA]]) |date=2005-09-06 |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>.

An issue of a religious nature arose in the UK when BK introduced a new prepackaged ice cream product; the label of the product included a silhouette of the ice cream that when rotated on its side bared a resemblance to the [[Islamic]] inscription for [[Allah|God]]. Several local Muslim groups protested and Burger King was forced to recall the product and reissue it with a new label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1951292005 |title=MBurger King recalls 'sacrilegious' desserts |author=John Innes |publisher=Scotsman.com |date=2005-09-07 |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref>

===Charitable contributions and services===
{{section-stub}}
Burger King has several of its own in-house national [[Charitable organization|charitable organization]]s and programs; the first is the Have It Your Way Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation with multiple focuses on hunger alleviation, disease prevention and community education through scholarship programs at colleges in the US.<ref>[http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/community/hiywfoundation.aspx HIYW foundation]</ref> and the McLamore Foundation, also a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation that provides scholorships to students in the US and its territories.<ref>[http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/community/mclamore.aspx McLamore Foundation]</ref> Additionally, there is an optional literacy program that partners individual restaurants with community schools in the US.

On the local level, BK supports several regional charitable organizations covering several various causes. In the [[Boston, MA|Boston]] region BK has affiliated itself with the [[Boston Red Sox]] [[Jimmy Fund]], a charity that supports juvenile [[cancer]] research at the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] in Boston.<ref>[http://www.jimmyfund.org/cor/special/burger/default.html Burger King

====1996 to 2001: Legal Proceedings====

When the existing registered trademark in Australia for Burger King lapsed in 1996, the American parent company wanted [[Jack Cowin|Cowin]] sought to terminate Cowin's franchise agreement on the grounds that he was failing to meet his obligation to open new stores in a timely fashion. Burger King proceeded to open more than seventy outlets in [[Australia]] under the Burger King name between 1996 and 2003. These were built upon existing franchise locations at international airports &ndash; the international territory apparently outside the Cowin licensing deal. As a result of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jacks Pty. Ltd. began legal proceedings in [[Australia]] against the Burger King Corporation citing breech of contract in regards to the master franchising agreement.<ref name="zesb">{{cite web |url=http://www.zarcolaw.com/CM/News/news26.asp |title=Burger King Hit With Whopper ($44.6 Million) Of A Judgment |author=Alina Matas |publisher=Zargo Einhorn Salkowski & Brito.

In 2001, the case was finally resolved in favour of Hungry Jack's in a case that eventually included the Australian operating arm of [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. HJP alleged that Shell had induced BKC to terminate its agreement in order to open its own franchises in it service stations in Australia.<ref name="zesb"/> As a result, a New South Wales court ordered Burger King Corporation to pay $75 million [[AUD ]] ($44.6 million [[USD]]) in damages to Hungry Jack's for breach of its franchise agreement.<ref>{{Cite Case AU|NSWCA|187|2001}}</ref> One final attempt was made by Burger King to appeal the decision to the [[High Court of Australia]]; however, this appeal was dismissed.<ref>{{Cite Case AU|hcatranscripts|S157|1|2001}}</ref>

==== 2002 to the present day ====

In 2002, Burger King Australia exited the country and sold a 51% share of its Australian restaurants to TPF, the company that operates Burger King in New Zealand. In an attempt to improve rapidly falling sales, TPF re-branded its Burger King restaurants as Hungry Jack's in late 2003 believing that the Hungry Jack's name with its 30 year history was the stronger brand. A market research survey conducted six months after the re-branding showed that Burger King had been the preferred brand, and that the words most often chosen by respondents in the survey to describe Hungry Jack's were "slow" and "dated"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. In mid 2005, TPF decided to exit the Australian market and sold its 51% share of the former Burger King sites to Hungry Jack's Pty. Ltd.<ref>[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2003/05/26/daily36.html In Australia, Burger King to become 'Hungry Jack's'] South Florida Business Journal, [[30 May]] [[2003]]</ref>

=== Operational nuances ===

[[Image:Hungry Jack's slogan.png|frame|right|The [[slogan]] "The burgers are better at Hungry Jack's" is well known in [[Australia]].]]

While Burger King has updated its logo to the "blue crescent" design in all other markets, the Hungry Jack's logo is still based on the previous 1996 revised Burger King bun-halves logo, employing the simpler bun-and-filling motif.

Hungry Jack's sells the usual range of burgers but also offers an Australian specialty: the Aussie Burger. This burger is based on the traditional Australian [[fish and chips]] shop favourite, including fried egg, bacon, onion, and [[beetroot]], with the traditional meat, lettuce, and tomato. Hungry Jack's locations are required to follow any menu changes made by Burger King.

Hungry Jack's breakfast menu, introduced in late 2005 in three states ([[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], and [[Northern Territory]]) and the other states on [[October 31]] [[2006]], bears little resemblance to Burger King's US breakfast menu. The main breakfast sandwich is served on either an [[English muffin]], [[baguette]] roll or as a wrap ([[breakfast burrito]]) instead of a [[croissant]]; the [[hash browns]] are served as patties as opposed to [[Tater Tots]] and they feature [[pancakes]].<ref name="hj menu">{{cite web |url=http://www.hungryjacks.com.au/Menu.aspx |title=Hungry Jack's menu |accessdate=2000-08-26}}</ref><ref name="bk menu">{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/#menu=2,-1,-1 |title=Burger King's US menu |accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>

The only BK trademarked products that HJ sells are the [[Whopper]] and the [[Ocean Catch]] sandwich. All other products go by a generic naming such as hamburger or chicken nuggets.<ref name="hj menu"/><ref name="bk menu"/>

Hungry Jack's retains strong links with Perth, with the city's first team in the [[Australian Football League]], the [[West Coast Eagles]], having been sponsored by Hungry Jack's since their entry into the league in 1987.

Hungry Jack's Kids Club mascots are unique to the Australian franchisee, as opposed to other international locations that use one the two existing BK kid's mascots, [[Burger King advertising#Kids Club|the Burger King Kids' Club]] or [[Burger King advertising#Honbatz|the Honbatz]]. HJ does have a Kid's Club program similar to the US offering, offering themed birthday parties at its restaurants along with its Kid's Club Meals. One other noticeable difference between the HJ and BK children's programs is the placement of the apostrophe in the name: HJ places it before the "[[s]]" while BK places it after.

Hungry Jack's in Australia has trademarked the new slogan, 'Oh Yeah', which was featured in commercials that ran late 2005/early 2006. Other changes at Hungry Jack's include a new salad line and deli-style baguettes.

Many Hungry Jack's restaurant locations are designed around a 1950s/1960s styled theme. Background music from this era may be played within the restaurant (occasionally through a '50s era styled Jukebox) with associated contemporary pictures and memorabilia utilized as part of the interior decor. In the larger sit-down style restaurants, the seats and tables are laid out in a 1950s [[diner]] style.

{{main|Burger King products}}
When the company first began, its menu consisted predominantly of [[hamburger]]s, [[french fries]], [[soft drink]]s, and [[dessert]]s. Beginning with the [[Whopper|the Whopper]] sandwich in 1957, BK has expanded the breadth of its menu by adding various non-beef items like [[chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]] and [[vegetarian]] offerings such as [[salads]] and meatless [[sandwiches]]; a [[breakfast]] menu; and non-[[soft drink]] beverages such as [[Icee]]s, [[juices]] and [[bottled water]]s. Additionally, as the company expanded both inside and outside the US, it introduced [[Globalization|localized versions]] of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK will occasionally introduce limited time offers (LTO) of special versions of its products or bring out completely new products intended for either long or short term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful, in 1994 Burger King introduced limited [[table service]] and special [[dinner]] platters; the concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.<ref name="nyt1">{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50F14F83E550C7B8EDDA10894DF494D81 |title=As Business Gets Lean, a Big King Dares Big Mac |author=Glenn Collins |publisher=New York Times |date=1997-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref>

In 1957, BK added its signature item, the Whopper. This 1/4 pound [[hamburger]] was created by Burger King founders [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]] as a way to differentiate BK from other burger outlets at the time. The sandwich became famous enough that BK eventually adopted the motto "Home of the Whopper."

By 1979, BK had significantly expanded the breadth of its menu with many non-hamburger sandwiches including chicken, fish, desserts and breakfast products. Like all QSR outlets, BK has also modified its core menu with variants on its sandwiches, LTO products and items that cater to specific dietary needs. In 1985, BK again expanded its menu offerings by adding new products such as [[French Toast]] Sticks, the [[Croissanwich|Croissan'wich]] and [[BK Chicken Tenders]]. BK has also 'tinkered' with its menu, modifying items like the Whopper into many "standard" varieties.

In 1998, US BK added a 99¢ ([[USD]]) Great Tastes menu to better compete with QSR competitor, [[Wendy's]]<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/prnewswire/access/27375113.html?dids=27375113:27375113&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+16%2C+1998&author=&pub=PR+Newswire&desc=Burger+King+Debuts+New+99+Cent+'Great+Tastes'+Menu&pqatl=google Burger King Debuts New 99¢ 'Great Tastes' Menu] The Associated Press in [[The Kansas City Star]], [[17 March]] [[1998]]</ref>. This value menu featured seven products: Whopper Jr., 5 piece Chicken Tenders, a bacon cheeseburger, medium sized french fries, medium soft drink, medium onion rings and small shake. In 2002, BK renamed it the 99¢ ([[USD]]) Value Menu revamped it to include a grilled sourdough burger, a bacon cheeseburger, small sized french fries and onion rings, small sized soft drinks, childs size shakes, chili, tacos, 5 piece Chicken Tenders, baked potatoes and a side garden salad<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2002/09/09/daily63.html Burger King promotes new menu] South Florida Business Journal, [[12 September]] [[2002]].</ref>. Many of the items have since been discontinued, modified or relegated to a regional menu option<ref name="usrng">[http://www.bk.com/Nutrition/PDFs/regional_menu.pdf US Regional Menu Nutritional Brochure]</ref>. In 2006, the Value menu was again renamed, to the BK Values Menu, with products ranging from 99¢ to $1.50 ([[USD]]).

As part of its 2003 reorganization, BK introduced several new products to its menu, including several new or revamped chicken products, a new salad line and its BK Joe brand of coffee. Some of the new products, including its [[Enormous Omelet Sandwich]] line<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2005-03-27-burger-king_x.htm | title=Burger King to offer whopper of a breakfast sandwich |author=Bruce Horovitz |publisher=USA TODAY |date=[[28 March]] [[2005]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/blogs/healthbeat/archive.asp?postID=761 |title=Word of the day: Meat'Normous |publisher=the Spokesman Review ([[Spokane, WA]]) |date=[[26 September]] [[2005]]}}</ref> and the [[BK Stacker]] line<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.komoradio.com/news/archive/4191016.html |title=Burger King Launches Line Of Jumbo High-Rise Burgers |author=Herb Weisbaum |publisher=KOMO Radio ([[Seattle, WA]]) |date=[[6 July]] [[2006]]}}</ref>, brought negative attention due the large portion size, amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats.

As with other fast food companies, BK has recently begun introducing products that feature higher quality ingredients like whole chicken breast, natural [[cheese]]s such as [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] and [[Pepperjack|pepper jack]], and other menu fair that attempts to appeal to the more adult palate and demographic. Again, not all of these products have met corporate sales expectations.<ref name="BK-BBlum">{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2004-03-21-burgerking_x.htm |title=Burger King zaps menu, image |author=Bruce Horovitz |publisher=USA Today |date=2004-03-22 |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref>

==Advertising==

BK has had history of hits and misses in regards to its [[Burger King advertising|advertising]]: During the 1970s, BK introduced a memorable jingle<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shephyken.blogspot.com/2006/05/hold-pickles-hold-lettuce-special.html |title=Customer service and more |author=Shep Hyken |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref>, several well known and parodied [[slogans]] such as ''Have it your way '' and ''It takes two hands to hold a Whopper''.<ref>[http://www.bk.com/#menu=8,1,2 Historical slogans and ad agencies on BK.com]</ref> However, starting early 1980s and running through approximately 2002 BK engaged a series of [[Advertising agency|ad agencies]] that produced many less than memorable slogans and programs, including its biggest advertising flop ''[[Where's Herb?]]''.<ref name="time">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960538,00.html Business Notes Advertising | TIME]</ref><ref>[http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/40104/ten_fast_food_fiascos.html Ten Fast Food Fiascos - Associated Content]</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v20/ai_4083228 Herb falls flat, but Wendy's breaks another winner - fast food advertising - column]</ref> The 1990s saw a highly successful [[product tie-in|tie-in]] campaign with [[Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] animated films, including the [[Academy Award]] nominated [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty & the Beast]] and Academy Award winning [[Toy Story]].<ref name="disney">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Burger-King-Corporation-Company-History.html Burger King Corporation, Turnaround under Grand Met in the 1990s] on [http://www.fundinguniverse.com/ FundingUniverse.com]</ref>  Beginning in 2003, BK began resuscitating its moribund advertising<ref name="BK-BBlum"/> with the hiring of the Miami-based advertising agency of [[Crispin Porter + Bogusky]] (abbreviated as CP+B).<ref>[http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=14482 Burger King Corporation Selects Crispin Porter + Bogusky As Lead Creative Advertising Agency] via PR Newswire; [[23 January]] [[2006]], [http://www.HispanicBusiness.com HispanicBusiness.com]</ref> CP+B introduced a series of [[Viral advertising|viral campaigns]] centered around BK's mascot, [[the Burger King]]<ref>[http://www.cpbgroup.com/ CP+B website] Examples of Burger King ads in the ''://Work'' section.</ref>,  inspiring an [[Internet meme|internet meme]] where the King appeared in farcical or menacing situations.

As one of CP+B new advertising strategies, they revived [[the Burger King]] character used during BKs [[1970s]]/[[1980s]] [[Burger King Kingdom]] advertising campaign as a [[caricature]]d variation now simply called "the King".

The famous Burger King "bun halves" logo made its debut in 1969 and endured well into the 1990s. As its name implies, it was meant to resemble a [[hamburger]]: the logo had two orange semi-circular "buns" surrounding the name, which was the "meat" of the logo. In 1994 BK updated the logo with a graphical tightening, replacing the aging "bulging" font with a smoother font with rounded edges. In addition, all secondary signing, such as roof and directional signs, was also updated with new rounded font.

In 1999, BK again revised its logo. The new Burger King logo is a stylized version of the original "bun halves" logo. BK changed the color of the restaurant's name from orange to red lettering, while leaving them sandwiched between two yellow bun halves. The new logo also tilts the bun halves and the [[font]] on an [[Coordinate axis|axis]], has a smaller "bun" motif and wraps the burger with a blue crescent whipping around the buns giving it a more [[circular]] appearance. Most restaurants did not acquire newer signs with the new logo, menus, and drive-thru ordering speakers until 2001. Again all secondary signage was updated with the new logo and type face, and all sign posts were repainted to match the blue coloring of the new crescent from their original black.<ref>[http://bizjournals.bison.com/press/pr4-14bk.html Burger King Shares Extensive Transformation Plans] press release on BizJornals on Bison.com</ref>

The Hungry Jack's logo is based on the original Burger King "bun halves" design, and has been used since Hungry Jack's founding in 1971. HJ currently uses an updated version of the "bun halves" logo, featuring the smoother font used in revised Burger King logo from 1994.
