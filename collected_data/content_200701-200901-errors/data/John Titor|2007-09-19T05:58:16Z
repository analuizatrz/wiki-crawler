'''John Titor''' is the name used by the person or persons who posted on several time-travel related [[Bulletin board system|bulletin board]]s during 2000 and 2001 claiming to be a [[time travel]]er from the year 2036. In these posts he made numerous ambiguous predictions about events in the near future, starting with events in 2004. He described a drastically changed future in which the [[United States]] had 5 presidents (one from each of five regions), the environment had been devastated by a nuclear attack, and the larger workings of the country had broken down.

Titor's posts sparked an intense debate on the Internet, with some people dismissing the claims, and others defending them. In the time since Titor left the forums, the predictions for events that were supposed to occur by this point in time have all failed to occur. Nevertheless, the Titor postings still have their supporters, who are quick to explain away these predictive failings.

Regardless of the particulars of the Titor story, the Internet phenomenon itself is an interesting study. To date, this has been retold on numerous web sites, in a book, and in a play. He has also been discussed occasionally on the radio show [[Coast to Coast AM]]<ref>[http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2004/08/06.html John Titor, Recap]</ref>. In this respect, the Titor story may be unique in terms of broad appeal from an originally limited media, an Internet discussion board.

==Titor's posts==

The first post appeared on the ''TimeTravelInstitute'' forums on November 02, 2000, under the name ''TimeTravel_0''. At the time, the posts had nothing to do with future events, and the name "John Titor" was not being used. The posts had to do with time travel in general, the first one being the "six parts" description of what a time machine would need to have to work (see below) and responses to questions about how such a machine would work. Early messages tended to be short. 

Soon after, TimeTravel_0 claimed to be a time traveler from the future and began making various descriptions of his time. As time went on he answered questions posted in the forum, and started to reveal a more complex picture of the future. Although most of his posts concerned the state of the world in the future, Titor also responded to questions both in the forums and in [[IRC]],<ref>[http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com/TimeMachine.cfm The Story of John Titor], scroll to "IRC"</ref> and sometimes posted images purporting to be the time travel device, or its manual. He also sometimes talked about more current events, for instance, in an early post he stated that "The breakthrough that will allow for [time travel] technology will occur within a year or so [2001] when [[CERN]] brings their larger facility online".<ref>[http://www.idlewords.com/weblog.09.2003.html Best Practices for Time Travelers]</ref>

The name "John Titor" was not introduced until January 2001 when TimeTravel_0 began posting at the Art Bell BBS Forums (which required a name, real or not, to sign up for an account).  The Titor posts ended in late March of 2001.  Eventually, a number of the threads became corrupted, but Titor's posts had been saved on peoples' hard drives and were copied to Anomalies.net along with new discussions of the science behind Titor's time travelling as well as his predictions.<ref>One of these forum posts exists in its original form, given by the link below; original webcrawler links are also given below</ref>  Around 2003, various websites posted Titor's posts, re-arranging them into narratives.  Not all refer to the original dates posted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johntitor.com|title=John Titor - Time Traveler|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

On numerous occasions Titor posted comments that appeared to be tongue-in-cheek. For instance, when asked why his images were of such low quality, he replied that he was not a photographer. When asked if "Titor" was his real name, he replied that it was "a real name".

===Outline===
In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from the year 2036, based in [[Tampa, Florida]] in [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], who was assigned to a [[government]]al time travel project. He had been sent back to 1975 to retrieve an [[IBM 5100]] computer which he said was needed to "[[debug]]" various legacy computer programs in 2036. [[UNIX]] will, according to him, have a [[2038 problem|timeout error in 2038]]. The 5100 has the ability to easily translate between the old IBM code, [[APL (programming language)|APL]], and [[BASIC]] programming languages. Titor had been selected for this mission specifically due to the fact his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the building and programming of the 5100.

Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for "personal reasons," to collect pictures lost in the civil war, and was visiting his family; Titor spoke of his family often. Titor also said he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease]] spread through beef products, and about the possibility of civil war in the United States.

Titor also had expressed an interest in unexplained mysteries when questioned about it by an online poster, such as [[UFO]]s (which in his time were still as yet unexplained). Titor suggested that UFOs and alien visitors may well be time travelers from much further into the future than his own time, and with much more accurate time machines than his own.

===The time machine===
Titor described the time machine on several occasions. In an early post, he described it as a "stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities", producing a "standard off-set Tipler sinusoid". The earliest post was more explicit, saying it contained:

# Two magnetic housing units for the dual micro singularities
# An electron injection [[manifold]] to alter mass and gravity micro [[singularities]]
# A cooling and [[X-ray]] venting system
# Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock
# Four main [[caesium]] clocks
# Three main computer units

According to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1967 [[Chevrolet Corvette|Chevrolet Corvette Convertible]], and later moved to a 1987 four-wheel drive truck.

Further, Titor claimed that the "Everett-Wheeler model of quantum physics" was correct. This model, better known as the [[Many Worlds Theory]], posits that every possible outcome of a quantum decision actually occurs in a separate "universe". Titor stated that this was the reason the [[grandfather paradox]] would not occur, following the logic of the argument, Titor would be killing someone else's grandfather in another timeline, not his own.

<blockquote>"[...]The grandfather paradox is impossible. In fact, all paradox is impossible. The Everett-Wheeler-Graham or [[many-worlds interpretation|multiple world theory]] is correct. All possible [[quantum state]]s, events, possibilities and outcomes are real, eventual and occurring. The chances of everything happening someplace at sometime in the superverse is 100%."<ref>John Titor, 2/2/01 10:09</ref></blockquote>

===Predictions===

The most immediate of Titor's predictions was of an upcoming [[civil war]] having to do with "order and rights"<ref>John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25</ref>. He described it as beginning in 2004<ref>John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36</ref> with [[civil unrest]] surrounding the [[United States presidential election, 2004|presidential election]]. This civil conflict that he characterizes as "having a [[Waco Siege|Waco]] type event every month that steadily gets worse"<ref>John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36</ref> will be "pretty much at everyone's doorstep"<ref>John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25 </ref> by 2008.

He also claimed that as a 13-year old, in 2011, Titor himself fought with the "Fighting Diamondbacks", a [[shotgun]] [[militia|infantry]] unit of [[Florida]], for at least four years. However, in other posts he describes himself as hiding from the war. As a result of the war the United States splits into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives.

This civil war, according to Titor, will then end in 2015 with a brief, but intense, [[World War III]]:

<blockquote>"In 2015, [[Russia]] launches a nuclear strike against the major cities in the United States (which is the "other side" of the civil war from my perspective), [[China]] and [[Europe]]. The United States counter attacks. The US cities are destroyed along with the AFE (American Federal Empire)...thus we (in the country) won. The [[European Union]] and China were also destroyed."<ref>John Titor, 11/7/00 21:23</ref></blockquote>

Titor refers to the exchange as "N Day". Washington and Jacksonville are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, [[Omaha, Nebraska]] is the nation's new capital city.

Titor is vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point he characterized hostilities as being led by "border clashes and overpopulation"<ref>John Titor, 2/8/01 9:40</ref> but also points to the present conflict between [[Arab]]s and [[Jew]]s as a harbinger of World War III<ref>John Titor, 12/06/00 21:36</ref>:

:"Real disruptions in world events begin with the destabilization of [[Western world|the West]] as a result of degrading US [[foreign policy]] and consistency. [...] The Jewish population in [[Israel]] is not prepared for a true offensive war. They are prepared for the ultimate defense. Wavering western support for Israel is what gives Israel's neighbors the confidence to attack. The last resort for a defensive Israel and its offensive Arab neighbors is to use [[weapons of mass destruction]]. In the grand scheme of things, the war in the [[Middle East]] is a part of what's to come, not the cause."

==Examination of the claims==

===Predictive failures===
The posts were met with skepticism when they were being posted but it was impossible to prove beforehand that they wouldn't happen. Since a number of dates referred to have since passed, critics have begun to note that the predictions have failed thus far.

One of Titor's earliest claims was that CERN would discover the basis for time travel some time around 2001. This event did not occur. An article about miniature black holes being created by CERN (a recurring theme, also ascribed to [[Fermilab]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|Brookhaven]] at various times<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16322014.700-a-black-hole-ate-my-planet.html A Black Hole Ate My Planet], mentions one widely-reported article in [[The Sunday Times]]</ref>) was taken by some to be evidence of this claim, but these events did not actually occur either.

Titor said that a civil war would begin in the United States, noticeably around the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Elections]], and that events would escalate to [[Waco Siege]]-like events every week. None of this apparently happened, though some supporters have objected that various world events are similar enough, or alternatively that Titor "really meant" something less obvious, the rise of a [[police state]].

Titor also claimed that the 2004 Olympics would be the last to be held. The successful [[2006 Winter Olympics]] demonstrated this claim to be wrong as well. Supporters have answered that Titor "really meant" the Summer Olympics, although nothing like this was ever stated in the posts.

Equally problematic are the predictions Titor failed to make. In May 2007, Seattle-based dentist and time travel expert Dr. Bruce Goldberg, on [[Coast to Coast AM]], brought up that Titor never tipped the world off regarding [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. [http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/john_titor_archive_page15.html]
Some suggest he perhaps entered a different universe, a timeline in which things happened slightly differently to his own universe.

===Problems with the technology===

The time machine device Titor describes is a modification of the [[Tipler Cylinder]], which has the problem that you can only travel back in time to the point where the device was first constructed. Titor claims the first successful device was created in 2034, which means that traveling before that time would not be possible. The description itself is largely nonsensical, a pastiche of pop-science terminology.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Brown|year=2003|url=http://communities.anomalies.net/forum/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Number/13443/page/1#Post13443|title=Dr. Robert Brown's Replies to Darby RE. Titor|publisher=The Anomalies Network Forums|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

The images posted by Titor are also problematic. The image of the [[laser pointer]]'s beam being "bent" has the obvious problem that objects around the beam are not bent. For instance, the framing of the window visible in the background shows no distortion, which would not be the case if there was a large gravity gradient in the area. Some have speculated the "beam" is a [[fiber optic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread62046/pg1|title=John Titor: Hoax|date=2004-06-26|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

Titor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an [[IBM 5100]] because it could translate several types of computer code. According to [[IBM]] [[engineer]] Bob Dubke, Titor's statements regarding the IBM 5100's little-known ability to [[emulation|emulate]] and debug [[mainframe]] systems were correct. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20051210175724/http://www.postbulletin.com/magazine/2004/08/index.shtml|title=Time traveller most likely to be spotted in Rochester, IBM 5100 Engineer Bob Dubke on hidden features|publisher=''Rochester Magazine''|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> Supporters state that this information was not publicly available in 2000/1 when Titor made his declaration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johntitor.com/Pages/5100.html|year=2005|title=News about the 5100 Computer|accessdate=March 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref> and Titor himself stated that this feature was "discovered (or at least known after testing)" as late as 2036<ref>John Titor, 12/30/00 13:37</ref>. However, this capability was actually widely known in the industry, and commented on in depth in numerous publications, both about the 5100 and APL in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/304/ibmsj3004C.pdf|year=1991|title=The IBM Family of APL Systems, IBM Systems Journal|accessdate=March 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref> References to this fact were also available on the Internet as early as 1999. This is a fairly obscure bit of trivia, however, which suggests whoever was making the posts was familiar with the machine, or had an interest in [[retrocomputing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com/|title=John Titor's Story|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

===Problems with the story===

An examination of the claims also suggests several problems with the story. For instance, In some posts Titor claims that money is widely used and they still have [[credit card]]s. In another post he speculated that today's money would be usable in his time, but this would be after the reorganization of the federal government according to his own history, which would make the money worthless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/hoaxes/90359.html|title=Tackling John Titor, Time Traveller|date=2003-11-25|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

Numerous commenters have pointed out the broad similarities between the Titor story and the classic post-apocalyptic science fiction story, ''[[Alas, Babylon]]''.<ref>[http://communities.anomalies.net/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=14859&page=5&fpart=4 TAN, What to ask next time], #14894</ref> ''Alas, Babylon'' takes place in a small town in Florida just before and after a nuclear war in 2010, and describes the struggle to survive as a family in the aftermath.

==Continued support==

The predictive failings of the Titor story have not stopped the story from continuing to be a topic of discussion in the [[paranormal]] world.

The most common way of dealing with the problems in the story has been to suggest they are not really the problems they appear to be, that the posts can be re-interpreted and thus be "correct", in a manner of speaking. One example of this is the claim that Titor may have been talking about ''summer'' olympics only, in which case it is not until the 2008 Olympics that the claim could become untrue. The lack of any obvious sort of civil war in the United States is generally claimed to be due to a slow rise in tensions; it was not going to start in 2004, that is the date people would point to only in retrospect.

Other supporters have speculated, ''[[ex post facto]]'', that the history relayed by Titor could be the result of a difference in his world line and ours, suggesting that people may have since created an [[alternate future]] by going about things differently. On the other hand, any statement can be supported by this idea; even if every one of the predictions proves to wrong, this could still be in agreement with this explanation. That means this line of argument is precisely the sort of unfalsifiable claim that [[Karl Popper]] noted when he developed his thoughts on [[falsifiability]].
