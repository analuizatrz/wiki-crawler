{{TOCnestright|before=<onlyinclude>'''Timeline of chemistry''' lists important works, discoveries, ideas, inventions, and experiments that significantly changed mankind's understanding of the composition of matter and of the interactions thereof, the modern science known as [[chemistry]].  The [[history of chemistry]] in its modern form is often considered to begin with the [[English people|English]] scientist [[Robert Boyle]], though its roots can be traced back to the earliest recorded history.</onlyinclude>

|after=Early ideas that later became incorporated into the modern science of chemistry come from two main sources.  [[Natural philosophy|Natural philosophers]] such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Democritus]] used [[deductive reasoning]] in an attempt to explain the behavior of the world around them.  [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] were people who used experimental techniques in an attempt to extend the life or perform material conversions, such as turning base metals into gold.
}}<!-- End of TOCnestright --->

In the 17th century, a synthesis of the ideas of these two disicplines, that is the ''deductive'' and the ''experimental'', leads to the development of a process of thinking known as the [[scientific method]].  With the introduction of the scientific method, the modern science of chemistry was born.  

Known as "[[the central science]]", the study of chemistry is strongly influenced by, and exerts a strong influence on, many other scientific and technological fields.  Many events considered central to our modern understanding of chemistry are also considered key discoveries in such fields as physics, biology, astronomy, geology, and materials science to name a few.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chemistry - The Central Science | work = The Chemistry Hall of Fame | publisher = York University | url = http://www.chem.yorku.ca/hall_of_fame/whychem.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-12}}</ref>

Prior to the acceptance of the [[scientific method]] and its application to the field of chemistry, it is somewhat controversial to consider many of the people listed below as "chemists" in the modern sense of the word.  However, the ideas of certain great thinkers, either for their prescience, or for their wide and long-term acceptance, bears listing here.
