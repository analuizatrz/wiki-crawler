'''Hurricane Paul''' was a hurricane that ultimately struck [[Mexico]] as a tropical depression in October of 2006. It developed from an area of disturbed weather on [[October 21]], and slowly intensified as it moved into an area of warm waters and progressively decreasing wind shear. Paul attained hurricane status on [[October 23]], and later that day it reached its peak intensity of {{convert|110|mi:h|km:h|-1|abbr=on}}, a strong [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2]] hurricane. A strong trough turned the hurricane to the north and northeast into an area of strong vertical shear, and Paul weakened to a tropical storm on [[October 24]]. It accelerated northeastward, and after passing a short distance south of [[Baja California Sur]] the low level circulation became decoupled from the rest of the convection. Paul weakened to a tropical depression on [[October 25]] a short distance off the coast of [[Mexico]], and after briefly turning away from the coast it made landfall on northwestern [[Sinaloa]] on [[October 26]].

Paul was the third hurricane to threaten western Mexico in the season, the others being [[Hurricane John (2006)|Hurricanes John]] and [[Hurricane Lane (2006)|Lane]]. Rough surf killed two people along [[Baja California Sur]], while flooding was reported in [[Sinaloa]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Paul 2006 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[October 4]]. It moved westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] without development, and entered the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[October 18]]. The next day, it combined with a previously existing area of disturbed weather, resulting in a large area of convection extending northward into southern [[Mexico]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jamie R.

Upon forming, the depression possessed a small, tight low-level circulation beneath a well-defined mid-level circulation. Easterly [[wind shear]] initially restricted upper-level outflow as the cyclone moved to the west, a motion due to a [[subtropical ridge]] to its north.<ref name="td17disc1">{{cite web|author=Stewart|year=2006|title=Tropical Depression Seventeen-E Discussion One|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep17/ep172006.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref>

The cloud pattern of the depression quickly became better organized as a curved band developed around intensifying deep convection, and it is estimated the system intensified into Tropical Storm Paul just six hours after forming. Easterly [[wind shear]] exposed the low level circulation to the east of the area of deep convection, though Paul continued to intensify as it moved through an area of warm waters and progressively weakening wind shear.<ref name="pauldisc2">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Paul Discussion Two|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep17/ep172006.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> The low level circulation gradually became more embedded within the convection as the cloud pattern improved. Computer models had troubles in forecasting the future of the storm early in its life; the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory|GFDL model]] forecasted Paul to reach winds of 119 mph (191 km/h), while [[Numerical weather prediction#Global models|global models]] expected the system to dissipate in 48 to 72 hours.<ref name="paul3">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Paul Discussion Six|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep17/ep172006.discus.003.shtml?}}</ref> Early on [[October 22]], wind shear began to decrease, which coincided with an increase of outflow on its eastern side.<ref name="paul4">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Paul Discussion Four|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep17/ep172006.discus.004.shtml?}}</ref> The storm temporarily degraded in appearance<ref name="paul5">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Paul Discussion Five|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep17/ep172006.discus.005.shtml?}}</ref> as it turned to the northwest.<ref name="paul6">{{cite web|author=Rhome & Pasch|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Paul Discussion Six|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep17/ep172006.discus.006.shtml?}}</ref> However, shear sharply abated over Paul late on October 22, resulting in the storm quickly gaining organization and intensifying.
