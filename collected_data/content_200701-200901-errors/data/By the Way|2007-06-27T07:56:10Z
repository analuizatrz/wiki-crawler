'''''By the Way''''' is the eighth studio album by [[United States|American]] [[Rock (music)|rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released on [[July 9]], [[2002]], on the [[Warner Music Group|Warner Bros.]] record label. The album sold over 282,000 copies in the first week, and peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard Top 200]]. <ref name=MTVBTW>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1531925/20060517/red_hot_chili_peppers.jhtml|title=''MTV'' Red Hot Chili Peppers news|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=MTV}}</ref><ref name="billboard">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers album chart history|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Billboard''}}</ref> The singles from the album included "[[By the Way (song)|By the Way]]", "[[The Zephyr Song]]", "[[Can't Stop (song)|Can't Stop]]" and "[[Universally Speaking]]".

''By the Way'' was applauded by some critics to be a departure from the band's previous styles, recognized for the melodic and subdued emotions given by the Chili Peppers.<ref name=AMGBTW>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gjfrxqr0ldje~T1|title=''By the Way'' Review - Zac Johnson|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref><ref name=RollingstoneBTW>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/129713/by_the_way|title=''By the Way'' Review - Tom Moon|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> It contained virtually none of the signature funk-punk fusion the band had become known for playing.<ref name=bbc.co>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/jvzf/|title=By the Way Album Review - Daniel Pike|accesssdate=2007-06-03|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Guitarist [[John Frusciante]] considered writing "''By the Way'' [to be] one of the happiest times in my life".<ref name=TGMJF>{{Cite web|url=http://rhcprock.free.fr/totalguitar_john.htm|title=Interview with John Frusciante|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=''Total Guitar Magazine''}}</ref>

==Background==
The preceding album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'', had sold over 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording, to date.<ref name="bbc">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3864401.stm|title=Chili Peppers' album tops survey|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref> A two year long global tour followed it and included numerous festival appearances,  including [[Woodstock 1999]] and [[Rock in Rio]].

''By the Way'' began formation nearly immediately after the culmination of ''Californication's'' world tour, in the Spring of 2001. Like with ''Californication'', much of the creation and writing took place in the homes of the band members.<ref name=ScrTissPg456> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 456</ref> Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated together at each other's homes for days, discussing guitar progressions and lyrics.<ref> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 458</ref> For Kiedis, "writing ''By the Way''...was a whole different experience from ''Californication''. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence".<ref name=ScrTissPg456/>

==Writing and composition==
[[Image:RHCPBTW.jpg|thumb|right|Red Hot Chili Peppers in a promotional photograph, which showcases their move into a more mature style of rock]]
Much of the album's bass and guitar ensemble was dictated by Frusciante, instead of a collective effort between him and bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]].<ref>Anthony Kiedis and John Frusciante - By the Way promotional Interview; Amsterdam</ref> It, therefore, took a different direction than any previous Chili Peppers album. Frusciante was deeply interested in creating emotional and poignant soundscapes throughout the recording.<ref name=TGMJF/> Inspired and influenced by musicians such as Vini Reilly of [[Durutti Column]], Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on ''By the Way'', utilizing tools such as the [[Mellotron|mellotron]] and various [[Effects pedal|effects pedals]].<ref name=TGMJF/> 

Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love.<ref> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 456-465</ref> Songs such as "Body of Water", "Someone" (both B-sides), "By the Way", "I Could Die for You" and "Warm Tape" all digressed into the many sides of love.<ref> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; pages 454-456, 458, 463-469</ref> Drugs were, as well, major influences in Kiedis' writings, as he had only been sober since December of 2000.<ref> Kiedis, Anthony - ''Scar Tissue''; page 433</ref> Tracks like "This Is the Place", "Don't Forget Me", and "Dosed", expressed his deep hatred for substances and how they affect everyone's lives. In "This Is the Place" Kiedis references his late friend and once fellow band mate [[Hillel Slovak]] and how drugs forced him to miss the funeral: "On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean". "Venice Queen" was a song written as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who passed away shortly after he purchased her a home on [[California|California's]] [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach]].<ref name=ScrTissPg456/>

The album stranded away from the band's previous styles, and, therefore, contains few funk driven songs. "Can't Stop" was noted as the only, with the title-track, song which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/r/redhotchilipeppers-bytheway.shtml|title=''By the Way'' Review - Kimberly Mack|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Pop Matters}}</ref><ref name=shazambtw>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shazam.com/music/portal/sp/s/media-type/html/user/anon/page/album/productid/10006758/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/By+The+Way.html|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers - By the Way|accesssdate=2007-06-03|publisher=Shazam}}</ref> "Throw Away Your Television", while not having any rap-based lyrics, still contained a funk oriented bass line, although hinting at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other "experimental" tracks include the trumpet based "On Mercury", a song centered largegly on [[Ska|ska]]. "Cabron", the only track to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, has visible latin influences. 

"[[Fortune Faded]]", "Save The Population", "Rolling Sly Stone", "Leverage Of Space" and "Mini-Epic" were all written and recorded for this album. But the all did not make the cut for the final track listing. "Fortune Faded" and "Save The Population" were later released on their ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album as new releases, and "Mini-Epic", "Rolling Sly Stone" and "Leverage Of Space" were performed at the Red Hot Chili Peppers 3 shows at Hyde Park in 2004, the latter of the two were featured on this live album.

Technically, ''By the Way'' saw the Chili Peppers employing many devices to distort and alter guitar and vocal sequences. "Don't Forget Me" utilizes a mellotron, [[Wah-wah pedal|wah pedal]], and echoing techniques in order to convey an emotional sense.<ref name=TGMJF/>

==Release==

''By The Way'' was released on [[compact disc|CD]] and [[LP]] on July 9, 2002 under the Warner Bros. label. It was certified gold just a few months later on October 26.<ref name="riaa">http://www.riaa.com</ref> Five singles were released from it; of these, the title track "By The Way" was the most successful, peaking at #2 on the UK charts and #1 on the Billboard rock charts. 

Although the album sold fewer copies than ''Californication'', ''By the Way'' managed to peak at #2 on the [[Billboard Top 200]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=5507&aid=538664|title=Artist Chart History - Red Hot Chili Peppers|accesssdate=2007-06-02|publisher=''Billboard''}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:judayl4jxpvb~T5|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Charting|accesssdate=2007-06-02|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref>, one spot higher than ''Californication''. Around the world, the album peaked at #1 on the [[UK Top 40]]<ref name=everyhit>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com|title=RHCP - By the Way|accesssdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Every Hit}}</ref>, the Swiss, New Zealand, Austrian, and Swedish charts <ref name=eurochart>{{Cite web|url=http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers&titel=Californication&cat=a|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Europe Charting|accesssdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Charts.org}}</ref> and #2 on the French Top 40.<ref name=eurochart/>

==Critical reception==
The album received a mixed reaction from critics. Some praised it for its more melodic, textured styles whereas others interpreted this becoming too 'mainstream' and criticised them for losing what they perceived as the Chili Peppers originality. [[AMG|All Music Guide's]] Zac Johnson said that the album was "sophisticated...the Peppers have not sacrificed any of their trademark energy or passions for life, universal love, and (of course) lust".<ref name=AMGBTW/> [[Rolling Stone Magazine]] called the album "insanely melodic" and a "near-perfect balance of gutter grime and high-art aspiration" and compared it to other works, such as [[The Beach Boys]]' album [[Pet Sounds]].<ref name=RollingstoneBTW/> ''[[Mojo]]'' applauded the recording, and considered it to be "the strongest Chili's album since 1991's ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''".<ref name=Meta>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/redhotchilipeppers/bytheway|title=By the Way metacritc compilation|acesssdate=2007-06-20|publisher=Metacritic.com}}</ref><ref>''Mojo Magazine''; 8/02 - Page 118.</ref>

However, this praise was balanced by other critics such as Indie music critic Piero Scaruffi, who dismissed the album as being "too mainstream". <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/vol5/rhcp.html#byt|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers albums; Piero Scaruffi|accesssdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' considered ''By the Way'' to be an indistinguishable sequel to ''Californication'', calling it "Californication 2"  and condemning the Chili Peppers for not varying their style.<ref name=Meta/><ref>''Blender Magazine'' - No. 9, page 142.</ref> Newspapers such as ''[[The Village Voice]]'' criticized the band for trying too hard to change.<ref name=vilvoice>{{Cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0234,lowe,37599,22.html|title=By the Way review by Jaime Lowe|accesssdate=2007-06-20|publisher=''Village Voice''}}</ref>
