'''Saint Lidwina (Lydwine, Lydwid, Lidwid, Liduina of Schiedam)''' ([[Schiedam]], [[March 18]] [[1380]] – [[Schiedam]], [[April 14]] [[1433]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[saint]]. At age 14, Lidwina was [[ice skating]] when she fell and broke a rib.  She never recovered and became progressively invalid for the rest of her life.  Her biographers state that she became paralyzed except for her left hand and that great pieces of her body fell off, and that blood poured from her mouth, ears, and nose.  Saint Lidwina is thought to be one of the first known [[multiple sclerosis]] patients and her fall and consequent disability are attributed to the effects of the disease.<ref>[[Caroline Walker Bynum]], ''Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987), 124.</ref>

==Life and legend==
After her fall, Lidwina [[fasting|fasted]] continuously and acquired fame as a healer and holy woman (although she was also looked upon as being under the influence of an evil spirit).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09233a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Lidwina<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The town officials of [[Schiedam]], her hometown, promulgated a document (which has survived) that attests to her complete lack of food and sleep.<ref>Caroline Walker Bynum, Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987), 124.</ref>  At first she ate a little piece of [[apple]], then a bit of [[date]] and watered wine, then river water contaminated with salt from the tides.  The authenticating document from Schiedam also attests that Lidwina shed skin, bones, parts of her [[intestines]], which her parents kept in a vase and which gave off a sweet odor.  These excited so much attention that Lidwina had her mother bury them.<ref>Caroline Walker Bynum, ''Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987), 125.</ref>    

It is also reported that four soldiers abused her during this occupation, claiming that Lidwina's swollen body was due to her being impregnated by the local priest rather than from her sickness.<ref>Caroline Walker Bynum, ''Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987), 124.</ref>

She died at the age of 53.

==Accounts of Lidwina's life==
[[Image:Heilige_Liduina_van_Schiedam.jpg|left||thumb|200px|Johannes Brugman's publication, printed in Schiedam in 1498.]]
Several [[hagiographical]] accounts of her life exist. One of these states that while the soldiers of [[Philip the Bold|Philip of Burgundy]] were occupying Schiedam, a guard was set around her to test her fasts, which were authenticated.<ref>Caroline Walker Bynum, ''Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987), 124.</ref> 

The well-known Flemish preacher and poet father [[John Brugman|Johannes Brugman]] wrote two lives of St. Lidwina, the first of which, printed at [[Cologne]] in 1433, was reprinted anonymously at [[Leuven]] in 1448, and later epitomised by [[Thomas à Kempis]] at Cologne in his ''Vita Lidewigis''. The second life appeared at Schiedam in 1498; both have been embodied by the [[Bollandists]] in the [[Acta Sanctorum]] under 2 April. More recently, in 1901, [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] published a biography of Lidwina.

==Veneration==
Lidwina's grave became a place of pilgrimage after her death and in 1434, a [[chapel]] was built over it. [[Thomas à Kempis]]'s publication caused an increase in veneration. In 1615 her [[relics]] were taken to [[Brussels]], but in 1871 they were returned to Schiedam. On [[14 March]] [[1890]], [[Leo XIII]] officially [[canonisation|canonised]] Lidwina. She is the [[patron saint]] of ice skaters and the chronically ill, as well as the patron saint of the town of Schiedam. Her feast day occurs on 18 March, 14 April, or 14 June, depending on region and tradition. 

In 1859 the Church of Our Lady of Visitation (''Onze Lieve Vrouw Visitatie'') was opened on the Nieuwe Haven in Schiedam, commonly called ''Frankelandsekerk'' after the area it was located in (West-Frankeland). In 1931 this church was officially dedicated to St. Lidwina and called Church of Lidwina (''Lidwinakerk''). The church was demolished in 1969, and the veneration of Lidwina was moved to the ''Singelkerk'', hence known as Church of the Holy Lidwina and Our Lady of the Rosary. This church was elevated to become a [[basilica|basilica minor]] on [[18 June]] [[1990]] by [[Pope John Paul II]]. The church is now commonly known as the Basilica of Lidwina. 

After the closure of the Church of Lidwina in 1969, the statue of the saint and her relics were removed to the chapel dedicated to her in the rest-home West-Frankeland on the ''Sint Liduinastraat'' in town. Only after the demolition of the chapel in 1987 were all devotional objects removed to the ''Singelkerk''.

Lidwina's name is attached to numerous instititions in Schiedam. Since 2002, the Foundation ''Intorno Ensemble'' produces a bi-annual musical theatrical performance about the '' town saint'' in one of the Schiedam churches. Outside Schiedam, there is a modern (1960s) church in the Dutch town of [[Best, Netherlands|Best]] carrying her name (''Lidwina Parochie Best'').

==St Lidwina and multiple sclerosis==
Historical texts reveal that she was afflicted with a debilitating disease, sharing many characteristics with multiple sclerosis as were the age of onset, duration and course of disease. St Lidwina’s disease began soon after her fall. From that time onwards, she developed walking difficulties, headaches and violent pains in her teeth. By the age of 19, both her legs were paralysed and her vision was disturbed. Over the next 34 years, Lidwina's condition slowly deteriorated, although with apparent periods of remission, until her death at the age of 53. Together these factors suggest that a posthumous diagnosis of MS may be plausible, therefore dating MS back to the 14th century.<ref name="pmid390966">{{cite journal |author=Medaer R |title=Does the history of multiple sclerosis go back as far as the 14th century? |journal=Acta Neurol. Scand. |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=189–92 |year=1979 |pmid=390966 |doi=}}</ref>
