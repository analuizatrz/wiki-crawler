In [[game theory]], an '''evolutionarily stable strategy''' (or ESS; also evolutionary stable strategy) is a [[strategy (game theory)|strategy]] which, if adopted by a [[population genetics|population]], cannot be invaded by any competing alternative strategy. An example of such a strategy would be a sexual display that is a [[handicap principle|serious handicap]], as this will prevent the invasion of the populations by "cheating" organisms in poor physical condition that fake an impressive display. This concept is particularly important in the study of the [[co-operation (evolution)|evolution of altruism]].

The stable strategy concept is an [[equilibrium refinement]] to a [[Nash equilibrium]], which is a strategy that prevents any organism in a population from gaining an advantage by adopting a new strategy. The difference between a Nash equilibrium and an ESS is that a Nash equilibrium may sometimes exist due to [[Homo economicus|rational foresight]] preventing players from adopting an alternative strategy with short term advantages, but long-term disadvantages. An ESS is defined to exclude such equilibria, and assumes that [[natural selection]] is the only force which selects against strategies with lower [[payoff]]s.

The term was introduced and defined by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]] in a 1973 ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' paper<ref name="JMSandP73">[[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]] (1973), The logic of animal conflict. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''246''': 15-18.</ref> and is central to Maynard Smith's (1982) book ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]''<ref name="JMS82">[[John Maynard Smith]]. (1982) ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]''. ISBN 0-521-28884-3</ref>.  The concept was derived from [[Robert MacArthur|R.H. MacArthur]]<ref>[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur, R. H.]] (1965). in: ''Theoretical and mathematical biology'' T. Waterman & H. Horowitz, eds. Blaisdell: New York.</ref> and [[W.D. Hamilton]]'s<ref>[[W.D. Hamilton]] (1967) Extraordinary sex ratios. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' '''156''', 477-488.</ref> work on [[sex ratio]]s, especially Hamilton's (1967) concept of an [[unbeatable strategy]].  The idea can be traced back to [[Ronald Fisher]] <ref>[[Ronald Fisher]] (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''. Clarendon Press, Oxford.</ref> and [[Charles Darwin]] (1859).<ref>[[Charles Darwin]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''</ref>

== Nash equilibria and ESS ==
A [[Nash equilibrium]] for a game is a strategy where, if all players adopt it, no player can benefit by switching to any alternative strategy. For example, if a player choosing strategy ''T'' in a population where all other players play strategy ''S'' receives a payoff of E(''T'',''S''), then strategy ''S'' is a Nash equilibrium if,
:E(''S'',''S'') ≥ E(''T'',''S'') for any ''T''.
This equilibrium definition allows for the possibility that strategy ''T'' is a neutral alternative to ''S'' (it scores equally, but not better). A Nash equilibrium is presumed to be stable even if ''T'' scores equally, on the assumption that there is no incentive for players to adopt ''T'' instead of ''S''. However, strategy ''T'' can invade a population where other players play strategy ''S'', unless there is a genuine ''disincentive'' to play it.

[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price|Price]] (1973)<ref name="JMSandP73"/> specify two conditions for a strategy ''S'' to be an ESS. Either

# E(''S'',''S'') > E(''T'',''S''), or
# E(''S'',''S'') = E(''T'',''S'') and E(''S'',''T'') > E(''T'',''T'')

must be true for all ''T'' ≠ ''S'', where E(''S'',''T'') is the expected payoff to strategy ''S'' when playing against strategy ''T''.

The first condition is sometimes called a ''strict'' Nash equilibrium;<ref>[[John Harsanyi|Harsanyi, J]] (1973) Oddness of the number of equilibrium points: a new proof. ''Int. J. Game Theory'' '''2''': 235&ndash;250.</ref> the second is sometimes referred to as "Maynard Smith's second condition". The meaning of this second condition is that although the adoption of strategy ''T'' is neutral with respect to the payoff against strategy ''S'', the population of players who continue to play strategy ''S'' have an advantage when playing against ''T''.

There is also an alternative definition of ESS which, though it maintains functional equivalence, places a different emphasis on the role of the Nash equilibrium concept in the ESS concept. Following the terminology given in the first definition above, we have (adapted from Thomas, 1985):<ref name="Thomas85">Thomas, B. (1985) On evolutionarily stable sets. ''J. Math. Biology'' '''22''': 105&ndash;115.</ref>

# E(''S'',''S'') ≥ E(''T'',''S''), and
# E(''S'',''T'') > E(''T'',''T'')
for all ''T'' ≠ ''S''.

In this formulation, the first condition specifies that the strategy is a Nash equilibrium, and the second specifies that Maynard Smith's second condition is met. Note that the two definitions are not precisely equivalent: for example, each pure strategy in the coordination game below is an ESS by the first definition but not the second.

One advantage to this alternative formulation is that the role of the Nash equilibrium condition in the ESS is more clearly highlighted. It also allows for a natural definition of related concepts such as a [[weak ESS]] or an [[evolutionarily stable set]]<ref name="Thomas85"/>.

=== An example ===
Consider the following [[payoff matrix]], describing a [[coordination game]]:

{{Payoff matrix | Name = Coordination game
                | 2L = A          | 2R = B          |
1U = A          | UL = 1,1        | UR = 0,0        |
1D = B          | DL = 0,0        | DR = 1,1        |
Float = center }}

Both strategies A and B are ESS, since a B player cannot invade a population of A players nor can an A player invade a population of B players. Here the two pure strategy Nash equilibria correspond to the two ESS. In this second game, which also has two pure strategy Nash equilibria, only one corresponds to an ESS:

{{Payoff matrix | Name = Simple game
                | 2L = C          | 2R = D          |
1U = C          | UL = 1,1        | UR = 0,0        |
1D = D          | DL = 0,0        | DR = 0,0        |
Float = center }}

Here (D, D) is a Nash equilibrium (since neither player will do better by unilaterally deviating), but it is not an ESS. Consider a C player introduced into a population of D players. The C player does equally well against the population (she scores 0), however the C player does better against herself (she scores 1) than the population does against the C player. Thus, the C player can invade the population of D players.

Even if a game has pure strategy Nash equilibria, it might be the case that none of the strategies are ESS. Consider the following example (known as [[Game of chicken|Chicken]]):

{{Payoff matrix | Name = Chicken
                | 2L = E          | 2R = F          |
1U = E          | UL = 0,0        | UR = -1,+1      |
1D = F          | DL = +1,-1      | DR = -20,-20    |
Float = center }}

There are two pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game (E, F) and (F, E). However, in the absence of an [[uncorrelated asymmetry]], neither F nor E are ESSes. A third Nash equilibrium exists, a mixed strategy, which is an ESS for this game (see [[Hawk-dove game]] and [[Best response]] for explanation).

===Bishop&ndash;Cannings theorem===
Just as Nash equilibria can be either a [[pure strategy]], or probabilistic mixtures of pure strategies (a [[mixed strategy]]), evolutionarily stable strategies can be either pure or mixed.<!--actually, are mixed ESSes *really* different from Mixed Nash equilibria in the same way that pure ESSes are a subset of Nash equils, hmmm, too tired to think straight just now--> 

The '''Bishop&ndash;Cannings theorem'''<ref name="BandC78">Bishop, D.T. and Cannings, C. (1978). A generalized war of attrition. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' '''70''':85&ndash;124.</ref><!--deserves to be an article of it's own--> proves that  all members of a mixed evolutionarily stable strategy have the same payoff, and that none of these can also be a pure evolutionarily stable strategy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holycross.edu/departments/biology/kprestwi/behavior/ESS/bishop-can.html|author = Prestwich, K.|title = The Bishop&ndash;Cannings Theorem (an annotated version of John Maynard Smith's exposition of the The Bishop&ndash;Cannings Theorem)}}</ref>.  The same logic also applies to [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] and so the same will hold true for members of a mixed Nash as for members of a mixed ESS.

== ESS vs. Evolutionarily Stable State ==
In population biology, the two concepts of an ''evolutionarily stable strategy'' (ESS) and an ''evolutionarily stable state'' are closely-linked but describe different situations. An ESS is a strategy such that, if all the members of a population adopt it, no mutant strategy can invade.<ref name="JMS82">filler</ref>. This idea is distinct from when a population is in an evolutionarily stable state, as this is when its genetic composition will be restored by selection after a disturbance, provided the disturbance is not too large. Whether a population has this property does not relate to genetic diversity, as the population can either be genetically [[monomorphic]] or [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]]).<ref name="JMS82">filler</ref>.

An ESS is a strategy with the property that, once virtually all members of the population use it, then no 'rational' alternative exists. On the other hand, an [[evolutionarily stable state]] is a dynamic property of a population that returns to using a strategy, or mix of strategies, if it is perturbed from that initial state.  The former concept fits within classical [[game theory]], whereas the latter is a [[population genetics]], [[dynamical system]], or [[evolutionary game theory]] concept.

Thomas (1984)<ref>Thomas, B. (1984) Evolutionary stability: states and strategies. ''Theor. Pop. Biol.'' '''26''' 49-67.</ref> applies the term ESS to an individual strategy which may be mixed, and evolutionarily stable population state to a population mixture of pure strategies which may be formally equivalent to the mixed ESS.

== Prisoner's dilemma and ESS ==
Consider a large population of people who, in the iterated [[prisoner's dilemma]], always play [[Tit for Tat]] in transactions with each other. (Since almost any transaction requires trust, most transactions can be modelled with the ''prisoner's dilemma''.) If the entire population plays the ''Tit-for-Tat'' strategy, and a group of newcomers enter the population who prefer the ''Always Defect'' strategy (i.e. they try to cheat everyone they meet), the ''Tit-for-Tat'' strategy will prove more successful, and the ''defectors'' will be converted or lose out. ''Tit for Tat'' is therefore an ESS, ''with respect to these two strategies''. On the other hand, an island of ''Always Defect'' players will be stable against the invasion of a few ''Tit-for-Tat'' players, but not against a large number of them. (see [[Robert Axelrod]]'s [[The Evolution of Cooperation]]<ref>[[Robert Axelrod]] (1984) ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]'' ISBN 0-465-02121-2</ref>).

== ESS and human behavior ==
The fields of [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] attempt to explain animal and human behavior and social structures, largely in terms of evolutionarily stable strategies.  [[Sociopathy]] (chronic antisocial/criminal behavior) has been suggested to be a result of a combination of two such strategies.<ref>Mealey, L. (1995). The sociobiology of sociopathy: An integrated evolutionary model. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'' '''18''': 523-599. [http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html]</ref>

Although ESS were originally considered as stable states for biological evolution, it need not be limited to such contexts. In fact, ESS are stable states for a large class of [[adaptive dynamics]]. As a result, ESS can be used to explain human behaviors that lack any genetic influences.
