The '''European Union''' ('''EU''') is a political and economic union of twenty-seven [[European Union member state|member states]], located primarily <!-- please do not remove this. Parts of Spain and France are outside Europe, and the geographical location of Cyprus is not clear. This word has been extensively discussed .-->in [[Europe]]. It was established by the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] in 1993 upon the foundations of the pre-existing [[European Economic Community]]. With almost 500&nbsp;million citizens, the EU combined generates an estimated 30% share of the world's nominal [[gross domestic product]] ([[United States dollar|US$]]16.8 trillion in 2007).<ref name="GDP IMF"/>

The EU has developed a [[single market]] through a standardised system of laws which apply in all member states, guaranteeing the [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital]].<ref name="Europa Internal Market">{{cite web |title=The EU Single Market: Fewer barriers, more opportunities |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]], European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-09-27}} {{cite web|title=Activities of the European Union: Internal Market |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|url=http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> It maintains a common trade policy,<ref>{{cite web |title=Common commercial policy |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/commercial_policy_en.htm |work=Europa Glossery |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref> [[Common Agricultural Policy|agricultural]] and [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]] policies,<ref>{{cite web |publisher=The Council of the European Union |title=Agriculture and Fisheries Council |url=http://www.consilium.eu.int/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=414&lang=en&mode=g |accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref> and a [[Regional policy of the European Union|regional development policy]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview of the European Union activities: Regional Policy |url=http://europa.eu/pol/reg/overview_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref> Fifteen member states have adopted a common currency, the [[euro]].

The EU operates through a hybrid system of [[intergovernmentalism]] and [[supranationalism]]. In certain areas it depends upon agreement between the member states. However, it also has supranational bodies, able to make decisions without the agreement of all national governments. Important institutions and bodies of the EU include the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Council]], the [[European Court of Justice]] and the [[European Central Bank]]. [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] elect the Parliament every five years.

The EU traces its origins to the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] formed among six countries in 1951 and the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957. Since then the EU has grown in size through the accession of new member states and has increased its powers by the addition of new policy areas to its remit.

[[Image:Schuman Declaration.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Schuman]] [[Schuman Declaration|proposing]] the [[European Coal and Steel Community|Coal and Steel Community]] in  1950]]
After the end of the [[Second World War]] the political climate favoured the unification of Europe. It was seen by many as an escape from the extreme forms of [[nationalism]] which had devastated the continent.<ref>{{cite web |title=The political consequences |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu/?doc=242&lang=3 |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> One such attempt to unite Europeans was the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] which while having the modest aim of centralised control of the previously national coal and steel industries of its member states was declared to be "a first step in the federation of Europe".<ref>{{cite web |title=Declaration of 9 May 1950 |url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> The founding members of the Community were [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]] and [[West Germany]].<ref name="Europa History 45-59">{{cite web |title=A peaceful Europe - the beginnings of cooperation |publisher=European Commission |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1945-1959/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

Two additional communities were created in 1957: the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) establishing a [[customs union]] and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) for cooperation in developing [[nuclear energy]].<ref name="Europa History 45-59"/> In 1967 the [[Merger Treaty]] created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the ''European Communities'', although more commonly just as the ''[[European Community]]'' (EC).<ref name="ENA Merge">{{cite web |title=Merging the executives |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=473 |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

In 2002, [[euro]] notes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the [[Eurozone]] has increased to encompassing fifteen countries. In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when [[Malta]], [[Cyprus]], [[Slovenia]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Hungary]] joined the Union.<ref name="Europa History 00">{{cite web |title=A decade of further expansion |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

On 1 January 2007, [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] became the EU's newest members and [[Slovenia]] adopted the euro.<ref name="Europa History 00"/> In December of that year European leaders signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] which was intended to replace the earlier, failed [[European Constitution]], which never came into force after being rejected by French and Dutch voters. However, uncertainty clouds the prospects of the latter treaty's coming into force as result of its [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland Bill, 2008|rejection by Irish voters]] in June 2008.

The European Union is composed of 27 [[Independence|independent]] [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[country|countries]] which are known as member states: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web |title=European Countries |url=http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/index_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref>

To join the EU, a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 [[Copenhagen]] European Council. These require a stable democracy which respects [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning market economy capable of competition within the EU; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfillment of the criteria is the responsibility of the [[European Council]].<ref name="Accession Criteria">{{cite web |title=Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria) |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> The current framework does not specify how a country could exit the Union (although [[Greenland]] withdrew in 1985), but the proposed [[Treaty of Lisbon]] contains a formal procedure for withdrawing. 

Four Western European countries that have chosen not to join the EU have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Norway]] are a part of the [[single market]] through the [[European Economic Area]], and [[Switzerland]] has similar ties through [[bilateralism|bilateral]] treaties.<ref name="EEA"/><ref name="CH">{{cite web |title=The EU's relations with Switzerland|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/switzerland/intro/index.htm |accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref>  The relationships of the [[Microstates and the European Union| European microstates]] [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], and [[Vatican City]] include the use of the [[euro]] and other co-operation.<ref name="euro use world"/>

[[Image:Mont Blanc depuis la gare des glaciers.jpg|thumb|[[Mont Blanc]] in the [[Alps]] is the highest peak in the EU.]]

The territory of the EU consists of the combined territories of its 27 member states with some exceptions outlined below. The territory of the EU is not the same as that of [[Geography of Europe|Europe]], as parts of the continent are outside the EU, such as [[Iceland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], and European [[Russia]]. Some parts of member countries are not part of the EU, despite forming part of the European continent (for example the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Faroe Islands]]). Several territories associated with member states that are outside geographic Europe are also not part of the EU (such as [[Greenland]], [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and all the non-European territories associated with the [[United Kingdom]]). Some [[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas territories]] are part of the EU even if they are not geographically part of Europe, such as the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Madeira]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], and [[Saint Martin]].<ref name="Amsterdam">{{cite web|title=Treaty of Amsterdam|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[EUR-Lex]]: Official Journal|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref><ref name="Consolidated Treaties">{{cite web|title=Consolidated Treaties on European Union and establishing the European Community|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|author=[[EUR-Lex]]|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2006:321E:0001:0331:EN:pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ECB where euro">{{cite web|title=Where is the euro legal tender?|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|year=2006|url=http://www.ecb.int/bc/faqbc/circulation/html/index.en.html#q2|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

Including the overseas territories of member states, the EU experiences most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] to [[Tropical climate|tropical]], rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless.

==Governance==
{{main|Politics of the European Union}}
[[Image:Lula-Sarkozy-cropped.jpg|thumb|The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency of the Council]] rotates semi-annually and is currently led by France.]]

The EU is often described as being divided into three areas of responsibility, called ''[[Three pillars of the European Union|pillars]]''. The original European Community policies form the first pillar, while the second consists of [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]]. The third pillar originally consisted of Justice and Home Affairs, however owing to changes introduced by the Amsterdam and Nice treaties, it currently only consists of [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]]. Broadly speaking, the second and third pillars can be described as the intergovernmental pillars because the supranational institutions of the Commission, Parliament and the Court of Justice play less of a role or none at all, while the lead is taken by the intergovernmental Council of Ministers and the European Council. Most activities of the EU come under the first, Community pillar. This is mostly economically oriented and the supranational institutions have more influence.<ref name="Glossary Pillars">{{cite web |title=Pillars of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/eu_pillars_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

The activities of the EU are regulated by a number of institutions and bodies. They carry out the tasks and policies set out for them in the treaties. The EU receives its political leadership from the [[European Council]], which is composed of one representative per member state — either its [[head of state]] or [[head of government]] — plus the [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]]. Each member states' representative is assisted its [[Foreign Minister]]. The Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes which have arisen between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies.

The Council is headed by a [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|rotating presidency]], with every member state taking the helm of the EU for a period of six months during which that country's representatives chair meetings of the European Council and the Council of Ministers. The member state holding the presidency typically uses it to drive a particular policy agenda such as economic reform, reform of the EU itself, enlargement or furthering European integration. The Council usually meet four times a year at European Summits.

The European Council should not be mistaken for the [[Council of Europe]], an international organisation independent from the EU.

===Institutions===
{{Main|Institutions of the European Union}}
[[Image:European Commission outside.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlaymont building|Berlaymont]] in [[Brussels]] houses the [[European Commission]].]]

The [[European Commission]] acts as the EU's [[Executive (government)|executive arm]] and is responsible for [[Legislative initiative|initiating legislation]] and the day-to-day running of the EU. It is intended to act solely in the interest of the EU as a whole, as opposed to the Council which consists of leaders of member states who reflect national interests. The commission is also seen as the motor of [[European integration]]. It is currently composed of 27 [[European Commissioner|commissioners]] for different areas of policy, one from each member state. The [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]] and all the other commissioners are nominated by the Council. Appointment of the Commission President, and also the Commission in its entirety, have to be confirmed by Parliament.<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission">{{cite web |title=Institutions: The European Commission |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

[[Image:EP Strasbourg hemicycle l-gal.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Hemicycle (chamber)|hemicycle]] of the Parliament's [[Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg#Louise Weiss|Louise Weiss building]] in Strasbourg]]

The [[European Parliament]] forms one half of the EU's [[legislature]]. The 785 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) are directly elected by [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] every five years. Although MEPs are elected on a national basis, they sit according to [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats. The Parliament and the Council form and pass legislation jointly, using [[co-decision procedure|co-decision]], in certain areas of policy. This procedure will extend to many new areas under the proposed [[Treaty of Lisbon]], and hence increase the power and relevance of the Parliament. The Parliament also has the power to reject or censure the Commission and the EU budget. The [[President of the European Parliament]] carries out the role of [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] in parliament and represents it externally. The president and vice presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.<ref name="Europa Institutions Parliament">{{cite web |title=Institutions: The European Parliament |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/parliament/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The [[Council of the European Union]] forms the other half of the EU's [[legislature]]. It is an organised platform where national ministers responsible for the area of policy being addressed, meet. Although the Council meets in different compositions, it is considered to be one single body.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council">{{cite web |title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> In addition to its legislative functions, the Council also exercises executive functions in relations to the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]].

The judicial branch of the EU consists of the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) and the [[Court of First Instance]]. Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU.<ref name="art220 Rome"> {{cite web |title=European Community consolidated treaty, (article 220, The court of Justice) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2007-11-08|format=PDF}}</ref> The Court of First Instance mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts, and the ECJ primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions and cases referred to the EU's courts by the courts of member states.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Court of Justice of the European Communities |url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/cje.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |accessdate=2007-09-14}};{{cite web |title=The Court of First Instance |url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/tpi.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|accessdate=2007-09-14}}; {{cite web |title=Institutions: Court of Justice |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/justice/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> Decisions from the Court of First Instance can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.<ref name="art225(1) Rome"> {{cite web |title=European Community consolidated treaty, (article 225 (1), The court of First Instance) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2007-11-08|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Legal system===
{{see|Law of the European Union|Treaties of the European Union|European Union legislative procedure}}

The EU is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sources of EU law |url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> These are power giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation<ref name="art249">{{cite web |title=European Union consolidated treaty, (article 249, provisions for making regulations) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf |publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2007-11-08|format=PDF}}</ref> which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.<ref name="Direct Effect">According to the principle of [[Direct Effect]] first invoked in the Court of Justice's decision in {{cite court|litigants=Van Gend en Loos v. Nederlanse Administratie Der Belastingen |reporter=Eur-Lex |court=European Court of Justice |year=1963 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML}}. See: Craig and de Búrca, ch. 5.</ref> National courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.<ref name="Supremacy">According to the principle of [[European Union law#Supremacy|Supremacy]] as established by the ECJ in Case 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v. ENEL'' [1964] ECR 585. See Craig and de Búrca, ch. 7. See also: [[Factortame case|''Factortame Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603'']], ''Solange II'' (''Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft'', BVerfG decision of 22 Oct. 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265) and ''Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; ''Raoul George Nicolo'' [1990] 1 CMLR 173.</ref>

[[Image:EUCoJ.jpg|thumb|right|The [[European Court of Justice|ECJ]] in [[Luxembourg]] can judge member states over EU law.]]

The main legislative acts of the EU come in two forms: [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulation]]s and [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]]s. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,<ref>See: Case 34/73, ''Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze'' [1973] ECR 981</ref> and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.<ref name="art249"/> Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.<ref>To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 27 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115</ref> When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have [[direct effect]] in national law against Member States. [[European Union decision|Decisions]] offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals or companies. They are most often used in Competition Law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.

One of the complicating features of the EU's legal system is the multiplicity of legislative procedures used to enact legislation. The treaties micro-manage the EU's powers, indicating different ways of adopting legislation for different policy areas and for different areas within the same policy areas.<ref>For a good example of this see Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty of Rome, Council Decision (2004/927/EC) of 22 December 2004 providing for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that Treaty and the Protocol on Article 67 of the Treaty establishing the European Community attached to the Nice Treaty.</ref> A common feature of the EU's legislative procedures, however, is that almost all legislation must be initiated by the Commission, rather than member states or European parliamentarians.<ref>{{cite web |title=Decision-making in the European Union |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making /index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-09-14}}. See: [[European Union legislative procedure]].</ref> The two most common procedures are co-decision, under which the European Parliament can veto proposed legislation, and consultation, under which Parliament is only permitted to give an opinion which can be ignored by European leaders. In most cases legislation must be agreed by the council.<ref name="decision making">{{cite web| title=Decision-making in the European Union|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions /decision-making/index_en.htm| accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

National courts within the Member States play a key role in the EU as enforcers of EU law, and a "spirit of cooperation" between EU and national courts is laid down in the Treaties. National courts can apply EU law in domestic cases, and if they require clarification on the interpretation or validity of any EU legislation related to the case it may make a reference for a preliminary ruling to the ECJ. The right to declare EU legislation invalid however is reserved to the EU courts.

===Fundamental rights===
At present the EU does not have a codified catalogue of [[fundamental right]]s against which its legal acts might be judged.<ref name="europarl-rights"/> However the [[European Court of Justice]] does give judgements on fundamental rights derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the Member States,"<ref>Case 11/70, Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v. Einfuhr und Vorratstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel; Article 6(2) of the Maastrict Treaty (as amended).</ref> and may even invalidate EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to these fundamental rights.<ref name="europarl-rights">{{cite web |title=Respect for fundamental rights in the EU - general development |publisher=The [[European Parliament]] |work=European Parliament Fact Sheets |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/2_1_1_en.htm |accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref> While the EU may be said to have an unwritten fundamental rights code, there have, nonetheless, been efforts to establish a written catalogue. In 2000 the EU drew up the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]]. The Charter is not legally binding at present but would become so if the Lisbon Treaty comes into force.<ref>By virtue of Article 1(8) of the Lisbon Treaty</ref>

Although signing the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership,<ref>It is effectively treated as one of the Copenhagen criteria [http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta08/ERES1610.htm].

==Foreign relations==
{{see|Foreign relations of the European Union|Common Foreign and Security Policy}}
[[Image:Javier Solana (2007).jpg|thumb|[[Javier Solana]] is the EU's [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative]] in foreign policy.]]

Foreign policy cooperation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a block in international trade negotiations under the Common Commercial Policy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Qualified-Majority Voting: Common commercial policy |url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/geninfo/fact-sheets/fact-sheet6/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-09-03 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]}}</ref> Steps for a more wide ranging coordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of [[European Political Cooperation]] which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until the 1987, when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the [[Single European Act]]. EPC was renamed as the ''Common Foreign and Security Policy'' (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.<ref name="EPC">{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm |title=European political co-operation (EPC) |accessdate=2007-09-03 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=The European commission |work= Europa Glossary }}</ref>

The Maastricht Treaty gives the CFSP the aims of promoting both the EU's own interests and those of the [[international community]] as a whole. This includes promoting international co-operation, respect for [[human rights]], [[democracy]], and the [[rule of law]].<ref name="art11 Union"> {{cite web |title=European Union consolidated treaty, (article 11, common foreign policy) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]| author=[[EUR-Lex]] |accessdate=2007-11-08|format=PDF}}</ref> 

The Amsterdam Treaty created the office of the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (currently held by [[Javier Solana]]) to co-ordinate the EU's foreign policy.<ref name="Europa CFSP">{{cite web|title=Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) - Overview|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|year=2002|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/intro/index.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> The High Representative, in conjunction with the current [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]], speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy matters and can have the task of articulating ambiguous policy positions created by disagreements among member states. The Common Foreign and Security Policy requires unanimity among the now 27 member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular policy. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP makes disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq,<ref name="BBC Iraq statement">{{cite web|title=Divided EU agrees Iraq statement|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|year=2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2697667.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> not uncommon.

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered a major factor contributing to the reform of former Communist countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name="Enlargement voice">{{cite web|title=EU enlargement - voices from the debate|publisher=British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1139992114487|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as "[[soft power]]", as opposed to military "hard power".<ref name="Soft Power">{{cite web|last=Bildt|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Bildt|title=Europe must keep its 'soft power'|publisher=[[Financial Times]] on [[Centre for European Reform]]|year=2005|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/bildt_ft_1june05.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

Besides the CFSP, the Commission also has its own representation in international organisations. This is primarily through the [[European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy|European Commissioner for External Relations]], who works alongside the High Representative. In the UN, as an observer and working together, the EU has gained influence in areas such as aid due to its large contributions in that field (see below).<ref name="EUObserver UN Seat">{{cite web|title=EU heading for single UN seat, UN official says|publisher=[[EUobserver]]|year=2007|url=http://euobserver.com/24/22553|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> In the [[G8]], the EU has rights of membership besides chairing/hosting summit meetings and is represented at meetings by the presidents of the Commission and the Council.<ref name="EC G8">{{cite web|title=EU and the G8|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=Delegation of the European Commission to Japan |url=http://www.deljpn.ec.europa.eu/union/showpage_en_union.external.g8.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref> In the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] (WTO), where all 27 member states are represented, the EU as a body is represented by [[European Commissioner for Trade|Trade Commissioner]] [[Peter Mandelson]].<ref name="Europa Trade">{{cite web|title=The EU and the world trade organisation |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/issues/newround/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

===Humanitarian aid===
{{see|ECHO (European Commission)}}
[[Image:ECHO plane.jpg|thumb|Collectively, the EU is the largest contributor of foreign aid in the world.]]
The [[ECHO (European Commission)|European Community humanitarian aid office]], or "ECHO", provides [[humanitarian aid]] from the EU to developing countries.

The EU's aid has previously been criticised by the eurosceptic think-tank [[Open Europe]] for being inefficient, mis-targeted and linked to economic objectives.<ref name="BBC Aid Inefficient">{{cite web|last=Mulvey|first=Stephen |title=EU attacked for 'inefficient' aid |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=[[2007-05-30]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6705773.stm |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> 
Furthermore, some charities have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief, foreign students, and refugees. Under the de-inflated figures, the EU did not reach its internal aid target in 2006<ref name="Indy Inflated Aid">{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Jerome |title=EU accused of artificially inflating its aid figures |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=[[2007-05-11]] |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/eu-accused-of-artificially-inflating-its-aid-figures-448343.html |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> and the EU would not reach the international target of 0.7% of [[Measures of national income and output|GNP]] until 2015.

Following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, the European Council agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the [[Helsinki Headline Goal]] process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the [[European Union Battlegroups|EU Battlegroups]] initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500&nbsp;men.<ref name="Council Capabilities">{{cite web|title=Military Capabilities|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[Council of the European Union]] |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=1349&lang=EN |accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> EU forces have been deployed on [[peacekeeping]] missions from [[Africa]] to the former [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Middle East]].<ref name="Council Operations">{{cite web|title=EU security and defence Operations |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[Council of the European Union]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=268&lang=EN&mode=g |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the [[European Defence Agency]], [[European Union Satellite Centre|satellite centre]] and the [[European Union Military Staff|military staff]].<ref name="Council Structures">{{cite web|title=ESPD Structures|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[Council of the European Union]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=279&lang=EN&mode=g|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

===Single market===
{{see|Four Freedoms (European Union)}}
Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a [[common market]], subsequently renamed the [[single market]], and a [[customs union]] between its member states. The single market involves the free circulation of [[good (economics and accounting)|good]]s, [[capital (economics)|capital]], [[Freedom of movement for workers|people]] and [[service (economics)|service]]s within the EU,<ref name="Europa Single Market">{{cite web|title=The Single Market |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they can not be subjected to [[customs duties]], discriminatory taxes or [[import quota]]s, as they travel internally. The non EU member states of [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]] participate in the single market but not in the customs union.<ref name="EEA">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/eea/index.htm| title =The European Economic Area (EEA)|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]] |accessdate = 2007-07-21}}</ref> Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.<ref name="Europa Single Market G">{{cite web|title=A Single Market for goods|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.<ref name="Europa Single Market C">{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Capital|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_42_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Until the drive towards Economic and Monetary Union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgments regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as that it is granted equally to non-member countries.

The free movement of persons means [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens]] can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.  This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.<ref name="Europa Single Market P">{{cite web|title=Living and working in the Single Market| publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm| author=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Traditionally the economically active were granted a much greater level of freedom than others. The extension to the non-economically active was first recognised in 1993 when the concept of Community Citizenship was introduced to the EU. In addition to extending the scope of the free movement of persons, it also grants certain social and political rights to the citizens of the EU.

The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states in order to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. Services account for between sixty and seventy percent of GDP, although legislation is not as developed as in other sectors. This has  been addressed by the recently passed [[Directive on services in the internal market]] which aims to liberalise this area of the market.<ref name="Europa Single Market S">{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Services|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm| author=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.

The freedoms are not absolute in nature. Member states may limit the exercise of the freedoms in accordance with the specific grounds laid down in the Treaty. For example, the Treaty allows member states to restrict movements that would pose a real threat to public policy or public security. In the absence of Community legislation it is for the member states to decide the scope of the exceptions. The European courts arbitrate as to whether the actions of the member state are proportionate and in conformity with Community law.

===Monetary union===
{{see|Euro|Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union}}
[[Image:European Central Bank 041107.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[European Central Bank]] in [[Frankfurt]] governs the [[Eurozone]] monetary policy.]] 

The creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the EU in 1969. However, it was only with the advent of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 that member states were legally bound to start the monetary union no later than 1 January 1999. On this date the [[euro]] was duly [[Introduction of the euro|launched by eleven]] of the then fifteen member states of the EU. It remained an accounting currency until 1 January 2002, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the [[Eurozone]], which by then consisted of twelve member states. The Eurozone has since grown to fifteen countries, the most recent being [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]] which joined on 1 January 2008.

All other EU member states, except Denmark and the United Kingdom, are legally bound to join the euro when the economic conditions are met, however only a few countries have set target dates for accession. Sweden has circumvented the requirement to join the euro area by not meeting the membership criteria. Slovakia is scheduled to introduce the euro on 1 January 2009.

A number of other countries outside the EU, such as [[Montenegro]], use the euro unofficially.<ref name="euro use world">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/the_euro/euro_in_world9369_en.htm| title=

The euro is designed to help build a single market by, for example: easing travel of citizens and goods, eliminating exchange rate problems, providing price transparency, creating a single financial market, price stability and low interest rates, and providing a currency used internationally and protected against shocks by the large amount of internal trade within the eurozone. It is also intended as a political symbol of integration and stimulus for more.<ref name="euro website"/>

===Competition===
{{see|European Community competition law|European Commissioner for Competition}}

The EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.<ref>Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty of Rome</ref> The Commission as the [[competition regulator]] for the single market is responsible for [[competition law|antitrust]] issues, approving [[mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], breaking up [[cartel]]s, working for [[economic liberalism|economic liberalisation]] and preventing [[subsidy|state aid]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |title=Competition: making markets work better |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/index_en.html |accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref>

The [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition Commissioner]], currently [[Neelie Kroes]], is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission, notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans-national corporations.<ref>{{cite web|last =Lungescu| first=Oana| publisher=[[BBC News]]|title =Examining the EU executive|date=[[2004-07-23]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/3921303.stm|accessdate = 2007-09-18}}</ref> For example, in 2001 the Commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the [[United States]] which had already been approved by their national authority.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]| title =The Commission prohibits GE's acquisition of Honeywell|date=[[2001-07-03]]| url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/01/939|accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref> Another high profile case, [[European Union v.

In negotiations on the Treaty of Lisbon, [[President of France|French President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] succeeded in removing the words "free and undistorted competition" from the treaties. However, the requirement is maintained in an annex and it is  unclear whether this will have any practical effect on EU policy.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title =EU competition to remain in place|date=[[2007-06-22]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6231684.stm|accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref>

By comparison, the UK's expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be €759&nbsp;billion, and France was estimated to have spent €801&nbsp;billion. In 1960, the six member state [[European Community|EEC]] (the predecessor of the EU) budget was 0.03% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euro-know.org/articles/wew.html |title=Will Europe Work? |publisher=Euro-know |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref>

In the 2006 budget, the largest single expenditure item was [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]] (direct aid, export refunds, storage, rural development and other) with around 46.7% of the total budget. Next came structural actions (Objective 1, Objective 2, Objective 3, other structural measures, community initiatives, innovatory measures and technical assistance, other specific structural operations and the cohesion fund) with approximately 30.4% of the total. 

Internal policies (training, youth, culture, audiovisual, media, information, energy, Euratom nuclear safeguards and environment, consumer protection, internal market, industry and Trans-European networks, research and technological development, other internal policies) took up around 8.5%. Administration accounted for around 6.3%. External actions, the pre-accession strategy, compensations and reserves brought up the rear with approximately 4.9%, 2.1%, 1% and 0.1% respectively.<ref name="ECDetail20002007">{{cite web |title=Detailed data 2000-2007 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/publications/fin_reports/fin_report_07_data_en.pdf |accessdate=2008-07-07|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Development==
===Agriculture===
{{main|Common Agricultural Policy}}

The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) is one the oldest policies of the European Community and was one of its core aims.<ref name="stead">{{cite web|last=Stead|first=David|coauthors=Robert Whaples (eds)|title=Common Agricultural Policy|publisher=EH.Net Encyclopedia|date=[[2007-06-22]]|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Stead.CAP |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers (article 33 of the Treaty of Rome).<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s the policy accounted for over 60% of the then [[European Community]]'s annual budget, and still accounts for around 35%.<ref name="stead"/>

[[Image:ClosLaPlanaEdit.jpg|thumb|left|EU farms are supported by the [[Common Agricultural Policy|CAP]], the largest [[Budget of the European Union|budgetary]] expenditure. ([[Vineyard]] in Spain)]]

The policy's price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction, resulting in so-called ''butter mountains'' and ''wine lakes''. These were [[Intervention storage|intervention stores]] of produce bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. In order to dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their produce outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers in the developing world.<ref name="Guardian CAP">{{cite web|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|title=The EU common agricultural policy|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2007-06-26]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/26/eu.politics1 |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The overproduction has also been criticised on environmental grounds in that it encourages environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/> Supporters of CAP say that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living, in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life. However, the EU's small farmers only receive 8% of CAP's available subsidies.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/>

Since the beginning of the 1990s the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially these reforms included the introduction of [[set-aside]] in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas (by the McSharry reforms in 1992) and more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). It is intended to move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to have the effect of allowing the market to dictate production levels while maintaining agricultural income levels.<ref name="stead"/> The most recent reform entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime which previously involved the carving up of the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.<ref name="EC CAP">{{cite web |title=Sugar: Commission proposes more market-, consumer- and trade-friendly regime |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |date=[[2007-04-14]] |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/915&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>

The Commission has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between [[Electricity distribution|electricity grid]]s; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in [[Central Asia]] and [[North Africa]]; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing use of renewable energy; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.<ref name="Energy Q&A"/>

The EU currently imports 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]] demands.<ref name="low carb prop">{{cite web|title='Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/ |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> There are concerns that the EU is largely dependent on other countries, primarily [[Russia]], for its energy. This concern has grown following a series of [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute|clashes]] between Russia and its neighbours, threatening the flow of gas. As a result the EU is attempting to diversify its energy supply.<ref name="Energy Russia">{{cite web |title=Ukraine-Russia gas dispute{{ndash}} call for stronger EU energy policy |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060112STO04233&secondRef=0|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===

[[Image:Oresundsbroen HCS.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Oresund Bridge]] between Denmark and Sweden is part of the [[Trans-European Networks]]]]

The EU is working to improve cross-border [[infrastructure]] within the EU, for example through the [[Trans-European Networks]] (TEN). Projects under TEN include the [[Channel Tunnel]], [[LGV Est]], the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel]], the [[Oresund Bridge]] and the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]]. In 2001 it was estimated that by 2010 the network would cover: {{convert|75200|km}} of roads; {{convert|78000|km}} of railways; 330 airports; 270 maritime harbours; and 210 internal harbours.<ref>{{cite web|title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules|[[European Commission]]|date=[[2003-10-01]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ten/transport/revision/doc/revision_1692_memo_en.pdf| format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-15 |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mirea|first=Silvia|title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules|publisher=The Railway Journal|url=http://www.cfr.ro/jf/engleza/0304/ten-t.htm|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>

The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Paper on Transport|publisher=Euractiv |date=[[2004-09-22]]|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/transport/white-paper-transport/article-129628 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> The [[Roads and expressways in Poland|Polish road network]] in particular was in poor condition: at Poland's accession to the EU, 4,600 roads needed to be upgraded to EU standards, demanding approximately 17&nbsp;billion euros.<ref>{{cite web|title=Transport – How Quickly will Polish Roads Improve After Accession|publisher=Urząd Komitetu Integracji Europejskiej|date=[[2003-05-29]]|url=http://www.ukie.gov.pl/WWW/en.nsf/0/574AB36381D2F551C1256E82004F9470?Open|format=|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>

Another infrastructure project is the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]]. Galileo is a proposed [[Global Navigation Satellite System]], to be built by the EU and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and is to be operational by 2010.

There are substantial economical disparities across the EU. Even corrected for purchasing power, the difference between the richest and poorest regions (NUTS-2 and NUTS-3 of the [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]]) is about a factor of ten. On the high end [[Frankfurt]] has €71,476 [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] per capita, [[Paris]] €68,989, and [[Inner London]] €67,798, while the three poorest NUTS, all in [[Romania]], are [[Vaslui County]] with €3,690 PPP per capita, [[Botoşani County]] with €4,115, and [[Giurgiu County]] with €4,277.<ref name="Frankfurt_Paris">{{cite web| url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/extraction/evalight/EVAlight.jsp?A=1&language=fr&root=/theme1/reg/reg_e3gdp| title=Table: E3GDP95 = Gross domestic product (GDP) at current market prices at NUTS level 3

The first environmental policy of the European Community was launched in 1972. Since then it has addressed issues such as [[acid rain]], the thinning of the [[ozone layer]], [[Air Quality Index|air quality]], [[noise pollution]], [[waste]] and [[Water supply and sanitation in the European Union|water pollution]]. The [[Water framework directive]] is an example of a water policy, aiming for rivers, lakes, ground and coastal waters to be of "good quality" by 2015.

===Education and research===
{{see|Educational policies and initiatives of the European Union|Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development}}
[[Image:Windkraftanlagen Dänemark gross.jpg|thumb|[[Renewable energy]] is one priority in transnational research activities such as the [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]].]]

Education and science are areas where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In education, the policy was mainly developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the [[ERASMUS programme]], a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20&nbsp;years it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5&nbsp;million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Erasmus programme celebrates its 20th anniversary |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-21}}; {{cite web|last=Jean-Sébastien|first=Lefebvre |title=Erasmus turns 20 - time to grow up? |date=[[2007-01-22]]|publisher=Café Babel |url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=9702 |accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref> There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.<ref>{{cite web |author=EACEA |title=About the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency  |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index.htm |accessdate=2007-07-21}}; {{cite web |title=Lifelong Learning Programme |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/national_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> Through its support of the [[Bologna process]] the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.

Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent [[European Research Council]] allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the ERC? |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]| author=[[European Research Council]]  |url=http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&topicID=12 |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> The [[Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)]] deals in a number of areas, for example energy where it aims to develop a diverse mix of [[renewable energy]] for the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Energy|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm?pg=energy |accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref>

Since January 2000 the [[European Commission]] has set its sights on a more ambitious objective, known as the [[European Research Area]], and has extensively funded research in a few key areas. This has the support of all member states, and extends the existing financing structure of the frameworks. It aims to focus on co-ordination, sharing knowledge, ensuring mobility of researchers around Europe, improving conditions for researchers and encouraging links with business and industry as well as removing any legal and administrative barriers.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the European Research Area? |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/index_en.html |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> The EU is involved with six other countries to develop [[ITER]], a [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] [[nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] which will be built in the EU at [[Cadarache]].

German is the most widely spoken mother tongue (about 88.7&nbsp;million people [[2006|as of 2006]]), followed by English, French, and Italian.

Besides the 23 official languages, there are about 150 [[regional language|regional]] and [[minority language]]s, spoken by up to 50&nbsp;million people.<ref name="Many tongues, one family"/> Of these, only the Spanish regional languages ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]), [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] <ref name="The Herald">"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4272797.ece| Welsh and Gaelic are official EU tongues]".

Besides the many regional languages, a broad variety of languages from other parts of the world are spoken by [[immigration|immigrant]] communities in the member states: [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Maghrebi Arabic]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Modern Standard Hindi|Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkan languages]] are spoken in many parts of the EU. Many older immigrant communities are [[Multilingualism|bilingual]], being fluent in both the local (EU) language and in that of their ancestral community. Migrant languages have no formal status or recognition in the EU or in the EU countries, although from 2007 they are eligible for support from the language teaching section of the EU's [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]].<ref name="Many tongues, one family"/>

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in the European Union}}

The EU is a [[secularity|secular]] body, with no formal connections to any [[religion]] and no mention of religion in any current or proposed treaty.<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention [[Christianity]] and/or [[god]]<!-- not specifically Christian so lower case --> in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.<ref name="EUO Merkel God">{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/eu-celebrates-its-50th-birthday--with-a-row-about-religion-440976.html |title=EU celebrates 50th birthday-with a row about religion | publisher= [[The Independent]] |first=Stephen |last=Castle |date=2007-03-21| accessdate=2008-03-04 }}</ref>
 
[[Image:EU belief in god.png|thumb|left|Percentage of Europeans in each Member State who believe in some deity<!---"a god" lowercase as it is not a specific god (i.e. The Christian God)--->]]

Emphasis on Christianity stems from this being the dominant [[religion in Europe]], and thus of the EU. It divides between [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], a wide range of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches (especially in northern Europe) and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] (in south eastern Europe). Other religions such as [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]] are also represented in the EU population. The EU had an estimated Muslim population of 16&nbsp;million in 2006,<ref name="Islam.de SecE">{{cite web|title=In Europa leben gegen­wärtig knapp 53&nbsp;millionen Muslime|publisher=Islam.de|date=[[2006-02-25]]|url=http://islam.de/8368.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> and an estimated [[Jewish population]] of over a million.<ref>Jewish population figures may be unreliable. {{cite web| url = http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/concepts/demography/demjpop.html | title = World Jewish Population (2002)| accessdate = 2007-05-03| author = Sergio DellaPergola| work = American Jewish Year Book| publisher = The Jewish Agency for Israel}}</ref>

[[Eurobarometer]] opinion polls organised by [[Eurostat]] show that the majority of EU citizens have some form of belief system but that only 21% see it as important. There is increasing [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]] among the general population in Europe, with falling church attendance and membership in many countries.<ref name="About SecE">{{cite web |publisher=[[USA Today]] |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-02-21-god-europe_x.htm |title=What place for God in Europe |accessdate=2008-03-04 |date=2005-02-22 |first=Peter |last=Ford}}</ref> The 2005 Eurobarometer showed that of the European citizens (of the 25 members at that time), 52% believed in ''a'' god, 27% in ''some sort of spirit or life force'' and 18% had no form of belief. The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were the Czech Republic (19%) and Estonia (16%),<ref name="Eurostat Religion">{{cite web|title=Eurobarometer 225: Social values, Science & Technology|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[Eurostat]]|year=2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> The most religious countries are Malta (95%; predominantly Roman Catholic), and Cyprus and Romania both with about 90% of citizens believing in God. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, increased with age, those with religious upbringing, those with the lowest levels of formal education, those leaning towards [[right-wing politics]], and those reflecting more upon philosophical and ethical issues.<ref name="Eurostat Religion"/>

Other significant religions present in the EU territories are [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] with the latter having a strong presence in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=954 UK 2001 census]</ref>

==Culture==
{{see|Culture of Europe|Cultural policies of the European Union}}
[[Image:Liverpool 2008 Flag.jpg|thumb|[[Liverpool]] is one of the two [[European Capital of Culture|European Capitals of Culture]] for 2008.]]
Policies affecting cultural matters are mainly set by individual member states. 
Cultural co-operation between member states has been a concern of the EU since its inclusion as a community competency in the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref name="Bozoki">{{cite web |last=Bozoki |first=Andras |title=Cultural Policy and Politics in the European Union |publisher=IECOB, Institute for Central Eastern and Balkan Europe |url=http://137.204.115.130/activities/download/Bozoki/Cultural%20Policy%20and%20Politics%20in%20the%20European%20Union.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the [[Culture 2000]] 7-year programme,<ref name="Bozoki"/> the [[European Cultural Month]] event,<ref name="Culture Month">{{cite web |title=European Culture Month |author=[[European Commission]]|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/ecocs/present_cap/retrospective_en.html |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> the [[Media Plus]] programme,<ref name="Media Plus">{{cite web |title=Media programme |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |date=[[2007-07-05]] |author=[[European Commission]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/media/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> orchestras such as the [[European Union Youth Orchestra]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euyo.org.uk/about/history.htm |title=An Overture to the European Union Youth Orchestra |publisher=The European Youth Orchestra |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> and the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme{{ndash}} where one or more cities in the EU are selected for one year to assist the cultural development of that city.<ref name="Capital Culture">{{cite web| title=European Capitals of Culture |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |author=[[European Commission]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/ecocs/present_cap/present_cap_en.html |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>
In addition, the EU gives grants to cultural projects (totalling 233 in 2004) and has launched a Web portal dedicated to Europe and culture, responding to the European Council's expressed desire to see the Commission and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by the most advanced technological means".<ref name="Culture Portal">{{cite web |title=Cultural heritage as a vehicle of cultural identity |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]

Within the EU, politicians, such as the [[President of the European Parliament]], appeal to a shared European historical/cultural heritage, including Greek philosophy, Roman law, the Judeo-Christian heritage, and a tradition of freedom and democracy, but also negative elements such as the [[World war]]s.<ref>For example: {{cite web | url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20070208IPR02888| title =Priority is dialogue for partnership and tolerance | accessdate = 2008-02-27 | author = Hans-Gert Poettering| authorlink = Hans-Gert Pöttering| date = 2007-02-13 | work = Inaugural speech by the new president of the European Parliament | publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa]], [[European parliament]] | quote ="The greatest success [. . .] has been overcoming the division of Europe. But shared values have prevailed. [. . .] Europeans should be proud of what they have achieved by their labours over the centuries in terms of values, freedom, law and democracy. It has been a long haul. We know that our European roots lie in Greek philosophy, Roman law, the Judeo-Christian heritage, the Enlightenment – in other words, our shared European culture. But there have also been tragic European civil wars, and in the 20th century the totalitarian ideologies, with their disdain for humanity, and then, in 1945, the courage of the founding fathers in following the path of forgiveness and reconciliation, in building a new, better, more peaceful, shared Europe." }}</ref> 

===Sport===
{{see|Sport in Europe|Sport policies of the European Union}}
[[Image:Campnoumatch.jpg|thumb|Spectator sports are popular in much of the EU ([[Camp Nou]], [[Barcelona]])]]

Sport is mainly the responsibility of individual member states or other international organisations rather than that of the EU. However, some EU policies have had an impact on sport, such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]], which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.<ref name="BBC Boseman">{{cite web|last=Fordyce|first=Tom|title=10&nbsp;years since Bosman |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Under the proposed [[Treaty of Lisbon]] sports would be given a special status which would exempt this sector from much of the EU's economic rules. This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the [[International Olympic Committee]] and [[FIFA]], due to objections over the applications of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.<ref name="IHT RT">{{cite web| title=IOC, FIFA presidents welcomes new EU treaty, call it breakthrough to give sports more power|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2007-10-19]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/19/sports/EU-SPT-OLY-EU-Treaty.php |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> 

Several European sports associations are consulted in the formulation of the EU's sports policy, including [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]], [[UEFA]], [[European Handball Federation|EHF]], [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]], [[FIRA - Association of European Rugby|FIRA]] and [[Confédération Européenne de Volleyball|CEV]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Statement of European team sports |publisher=UEFA.com|date=[[2007-10-19]]|url=http://www.uefa.com/multimediafiles/download/uefa/keytopics/560675_download.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> All EU member states and their respective national sport associations participate in European sport organisations such as [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA |publisher=UEFA.com|date=[[2007-10-19]] |url=http://www.uefa.com/ |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref>
