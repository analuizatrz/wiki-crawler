==Construction==
''Pirie'' was laid down at the [[Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd|Broken Hill Propriety]] Shipyard at [[Whyalla, South Australia]] on [[19 May]] [[1941]], launched on [[3 December]] [[1941]] by Mrs. H. T.

==Operational history==
On [[11 April]] [[1943]], while escorting a British supply ship to [[Oro Bay]], ''Pirie'' was attacked by a large number of Japanese dive bombers.<ref name=spc/> At least seven bombs were dropped; the first six were near-misses, but the seventh penetrated the armoured bridge canopy, deflected off the hemsman's station, struck and killed the Gunnery Officer, then detonated on the upper deck.<ref name=spc/> Apart from the Gunnery Officer, six sailors were killed and four more wounded.<ref name=spc/> Anti-aircraft fire drove off the fighters before they could attack again, and downed several planes.<ref name=spc/> Repairs were completed in May 1943.<ref name=spc/>
