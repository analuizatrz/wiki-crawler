A '''dragonfly''' is a type of [[insect]] belonging to the order [[Odonata]], the suborder [[Epiprocta]] or, in the strict sense, the infraorder '''Anisoptera'''. It is characterized by large [[compound eye|multifaceted eyes]], two pairs of strong transparent [[insect wing|wings]], and an elongated body. Dragonflies are similar to [[damselflies]], but the adults can be differentiated by the fact that the wings of most dragonflies are held away from, and perpendicular to, the body when at rest. 

Dragonflies typically eat [[mosquito]]es, and other small insects like [[fly|flies]], [[bee]]s, ants and [[butterfly|butterflies]]. They are therefore valued as [[predation|predators]], since they help control populations of harmful insects. Dragonflies are usually found around lakes, ponds, streams and [[wetland]]s because their [[larva]]e, known as "[[nymph (biology)|nymphs]]", are aquatic. Adult dragonflies do not bite or sting humans, though nymphs are capable of delivering a painful bite.

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Dragonfly larva.jpg|thumb|left|Dragonfly [[nymph (biology)|nymph]]]]
[[Image:Dragonfly emerging.JPG|thumb|]]
Female dragonfly lay [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in or near water, often on floating or emergent plants. When laying eggs, some species will submerge themselves completely in order to lay their eggs on a good surface. Most of a dragonfly's life is spent in the [[naiad (biology)|naiad]] (that is, nymph) form, beneath the water's surface, using internal gills to breathe, and using [[insect mouthparts|extendable jaws]] to catch other invertebrates or even vertebrates such as tadpoles, fish, etc. Some nymphs even hunt on land,<ref>{{cite book | last = Grzimeck | first = HC | authorlink = | coauthors = Bernard | title = Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia Vol 22 | publisher = Visible Ink Press | date = 1975 | location = Detroit | id = | pages = 348 }} </ref> an aptitude which could easily have been more common in ancient times when terrestrial predators were clumsier. The larval stage of large dragonflies may last as long as five years. In smaller species, this stage may last between two months and three years. When the larva is ready to metamorphose into an adult, it climbs up a [[Reed (plant)|reed]] or other emergent plant. Exposure to air causes the larvae to begin breathing. The skin splits at a weak spot behind the head and the adult dragonfly crawls out of its old larval skin, pumps up its wings, and flies off to feed on midges and flies. The adult stage of larger species of dragonfly can last as long as four months.

===Classific (Anisozygoptera)===
Formerly, the Anisoptera were given suborder rank beside the "ancient dragonflies" (Anisozygoptera) which were believed to contain the two living species of the genus ''[[Epiophlebia]]'' and numerous fossil ones. More recently it turned out that the "anisozygopterans" form a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] assemblage of [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] primitive relatives of the Anisoptera. Thus, the Anisoptera (true dragonflies) are reduced to an [[infraorder]] in the new suborder Epiprocta (dragonflies in general). The artificial grouping Anisozygoptera is disbanded, its members being largely recognized as extinct offshoots at various stages of dragonfly [[evolution]]. The two living species formerly placed there &mdash; the Asian relict dragonflies &mdash; form the infraorder [[Epiophlebioptera]] alongside the Anisoptera.
<!--
The oldest known species of bitch is the 320-million-year-old ''[[Delitzschala bitterfeldensis]]''. Another prehistoric genus is ''[[Namurotypus]]''.

[Apparently none of these were dragonflies, but rather ancient Odonatoptera. This name has replaced the old meaning of Odonata, as nowadays the Odonata apurple dragonflies are cool and yellow are not.
-->

===Dragonflies and damselflies===
[[Image:Sydney flatwing04.jpg|thumb|220px|Unusually for a damselfly, the Sydney Flatwing hold their wings horizontal (perpendicular) to their body]]
[[Damselfly|Damselflies]] (suborder Zygoptera) are often confused with dragonflies, but these are distinct; most damselflies hold their wings at rest together above the body or held slightly open above (such as in the family Lestidae), whereas most dragonflies at rest hold their wings horizontally or occasionally slightly down and forward. Also, the back wing of the dragonfly broadens near the base, caudal to the connecting point at the body, while the back wing of the damselfly is essentially similar to the front wing. The eyes on a damselfly are apart; in most dragonflies the eyes touch. Notable exceptions to this rule are the Petaluridae (Petaltails) and the Gomphidae (Clubtails).

In East Asia and among Native Americans, dragonflies have a far better reputation, one that can also be said to have positively influenced modern day views about dragonflies in most countries, in the same vein as the insect's namesake, the [[dragon]], which has a positive image in the east,{{Fact|date=September 2008}} but initially had an association with evil in the west.

For some Native American tribes they represent swiftness and activity, and for the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] they symbolize pure water. Dragonflies are a common motif in [[Zuni]] pottery; stylized as a double-barred cross, they appear in [[Hopi]] rock art and on [[Pueblo people|Pueblo]] necklaces.<ref name="Mitchell-20">Mitchell and Lasswell, 20-26.</ref>  It is said in some Native American beliefs that dragonflies are a symbol of renewal after a time of great hardship.

In [[Japan]] dragonflies are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness, and they often appear in art and literature, especially [[haiku]]. In ancient mythology, Japan was known as ''Akitsushima'', which means "Land of the Dragonflies". The love for dragonflies is reflected by the fact that there are traditional names for almost all of the 200 species of dragonflies found in and around Japan.<ref>{{cite book | last = Waldbauer | first = Gilbert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Handy Bug Answer Book| publisher = Visible Ink Press | date = 1998 | location = Detroit | isbn = 1-57859-049-3 | pages = 91 }} </ref>  Japanese children catch large dragonflies as a game, using a hair with a small pebble tied to each end, which they throw into the air. The dragonfly mistakes the pebbles for prey, gets tangled in the hair, and is dragged to the ground by the weight.<ref name="Mitchell-38">Mitchell and Lasswell, 38.</ref>

Also, in [[Japan]], amongst the [[Three Great Spears of Japan]] is one which is called the [[Tonbogiri]], which when translated is called 'The Dragon Fly Cutter'. The spear is an important part of Japan's imperial regalia - the spear itself was once wielded by the legendary [[Samurai]], [[Honda Tadakatsu]]. Its name is derived from the story that the blade is so sharp, a dragonfly once landed on it and was instantly cut in half.
