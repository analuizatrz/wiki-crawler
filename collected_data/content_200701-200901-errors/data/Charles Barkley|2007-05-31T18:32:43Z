'''Charles Wade Barkley''' (born [[February 20]] [[1963]]) is a retired [[United States|American]] professional [[basketball]] player. Commonly nicknamed "Sir Charles" and "The Round Mound of Rebound", Barkley established himself as one of the most dominating [[Power forward (basketball)|power forwards]] in the history of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He was selected to both the [[All-NBA]] First Team and All-NBA Second Team five times, and All-NBA Third Team once. In 1993, he was voted [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] and during the NBA's 50th anniversary, named one of the [[NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team|50 Greatest Players in NBA History]]. He competed in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic games]], and won two gold medals as a member of the [[United States]]' [[Dream Team]]. In 2006, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].

As an eleven time [[NBA All-Star]], Barkley was known for his aggressive play and outspoken demeanor. He was popular with fans and the media, and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for each of his last thirteen seasons in the league.<ref name="nbaob">nba.com, [http://www.nba.com/playerfile/charles_barkley/bio.html Charles Barkley: Original Bio], accessed [[March 6]], [[2007]] </ref> His tenacity and strength made him one of the most dominant [[rebound (basketball)|rebounders]] in the league, despite his relative lack of height for playing the power forward position. He was one of the most versatile players, with the ability to score, rebound, [[assist (basketball)|assist]], and defend. In 2000, he retired as one of only four players in NBA history to accumulate at least 20,000 [[point (basketball)|points]], 10,000 rebounds, and 4,000 assists in their career.<ref name="nbah"/>

Since retiring as a player, Barkley has had a highly successful career as a [[color commentator]] on basketball. He currently works with [[Turner Network Television]] (TNT) as a studio analyst for their coverage of NBA games.<ref name="nbabio"/>

==Early life==
Barkley was born and raised in rural [[Leeds, Alabama]], ten miles outside of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and attended Leeds High School. As a junior, Barkley measured 5 feet 10 inches and weighed 220 pounds. Due to his lack of height, Barkley failed to make the [[varsity team]] and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer Barkley grew to 6 feet 4 inches, 240 pounds, and earned a starting position on the varsity team in his senior year. He averaged 19.1 points and 17.9 rebounds per game, and led his team to a 26–3 record en route to the state semifinals.<ref name="bbio"/> Despite his play, Barkley did not garner any attention from college scouts until the state high school semifinals, where he scored 26 points against Alabama's most highly recruited player, Bobby Lee Hurt.<ref name="bbio">Charles Barkley. (n.d.). Contemporary Black Biography. Answers.com, [http://www.answers.com/topic/charles-barkley Charles Barkley], accessed [[May 16]], [[2007]].</ref> An assistant to [[Auburn Tigers basketball|Auburn University's]] head coach, [[Sonny Smith]], was at the game and reported seeing, "a fat guy...who can play like the wind."<ref>Michael Wilbon, "Barkley: the Great Wide Hope", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[April 23]], [[1984]].</ref> Barkley was then recruited by Smith, and [[academic major|majored]] in [[business management]] while attending Auburn.<ref name="bbio"/>

==College==
Barkley played [[college basketball|collegiate basketball]] at Auburn University for three years. Although he struggled with weight problems, sometimes weighing over 300&nbsp;pounds (136&nbsp;kg), he excelled as a player and led the league in rebounding each year.<ref name="nbaob"/> He became a popular crowd-pleaser, exciting the fans with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and [[Block (basketball)|blocked shots]] that belied his lack of height and overweight frame. It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive rebound and, instead of passing, [[Dribble#Basketball|dribble]] the entire length of the court and finish at the opposite end with a rim-rattling two-handed dunk. His physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname, "The Round Mound of Rebound."<ref name="nbabio">nba.com/history, [http://www.nba.com/history/players/barkley_bio.html Charles Barkley: Historical Biography], accessed [[March 5]], [[2007]] </ref> 

During his college career, Barkley played the [[center (basketball)|center]] position, despite being significantly shorter than the average center. His height, frequently listed as 6&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches, is actually, as stated in his book, ''[[I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It]]'', closer to 6&nbsp;feet 4&nbsp;inches. He received numerous awards, including [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) [[SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] (1984), two All-SEC (1983–84) selections, two Second Team All-SEC (1982–83) selections, and one Third Team [[All-America]]n selection (1984).<ref name="bcs">sportsstats.com, [http://www.sportsstats.com/ACC/national/players/1980/Charles_Barkley Barkley College Statistics], accessed, [[February 10]], [[2007]]</ref> In addition, Barkley was later named SEC Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the [[Birmingham Post-Herald]].<ref name="tigers"/>

In Barkley's three year college career, he averaged 14.1 points on 65.2% field goal shooting, 9.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.7 blocks per game.<ref name="tigers">auburntigers.cstv.com, [http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/aub-centennial.html Official Site of Auburn Athletics: Men's Basketball], accessed, [[April 5]], [[2007]]</ref> In [[1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1984]], he made his only appearance in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] and finished with 23 points on 80% [[field goal percentage|field goal shooting]], 17 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocks.<ref name="bcs"/> In honor of his career achievements, Barkley's number 34 Auburn jersey was officially retired on [[March 3]], [[2001]].<ref name="tigers"/>

==NBA career==
===Philadelphia 76ers===
After his junior year in college, Barkley left before his final year at Auburn and made himself eligible for the [[1984 NBA Draft]]. He was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], two slots after the [[Chicago Bulls]] drafted [[Michael Jordan]]. He joined a veteran team that included [[Julius Erving]], [[Moses Malone]], and [[Maurice Cheeks]]; players who took Philadelphia to the [[1983 NBA Finals|1983 NBA championship]]. Under the tutelage of Moses Malone, Barkley was able to manage his ongoing weight problems, and learned to prepare and condition himself properly for a game. He averaged 14.0 points and 8.6 rebounds per game during the regular season and earned a berth on the All-Rookie Team.<ref name="nbah">nba.com/stats, [http://www.nba.com/history/players/barkley_stats.html Charles Barkley Career Statistics], accessed [[March 7]], [[2007]]</ref> In [[1985 NBA Playoffs|the postseason]], the Sixers advanced into the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Finals but were defeated in five games by the [[Boston Celtics]].<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=PHI&yr=1984&lg=n 76ers 1984-85 Game Log and Scores], accessed [[March 11]], [[2007]]</ref> As a rookie in the postseason, Barkley averaged 14.9 points and 11.1 rebounds per game.<ref name="nbaob"/>

[[Image:Barkley_1988_SI_Cover.jpg‎ |thumb|170px| Charles Barkley making his first appearance on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1988.]]
The [[1987-88 NBA season|following season]], Julius Erving announced his retirement and Barkley became the Sixers' [[franchise player]].<ref name="nbaob"/> Playing in 80 games and 300 more minutes than his nearest teammate, Barkley had his most productive season, averaging 28.3 points on 58.7% field goal shooting and 11.9 rebounds per game.<ref name="nbah"/> He appeared in his second All-Star Game and was named to the [[All-NBA]] First Team for the first time in his career. His singular celebrity status as the Sixers franchise player led to his first appearance on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.<ref name="nbaob"/> However, for the first time since the [[1974-75 NBA season|1974-75 season]], the 76ers failed to make [[1988 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].<ref name="nbaob"/> In the [[1988-89 NBA season|1988-89 season]], Barkley continued to play well, averaging 25.8 points on 57.9% shooting and 12.5 rebounds per game.<ref name="nbah"/> He earned his third straight All-Star Game appearance and was named to the All-NBA First team for the second straight season. However, despite Barkley contributing 27.0 points on 64.4% field goal shooting, 11.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists,<ref name="cbcstats"/> the 76ers were [[Sweep#Sports|swept]] in the first round of [[1989 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] by the [[New York Knicks]].

During the [[1989-90 NBA season|1989-90 season]], despite receiving more first-place votes,<ref>espn.com, [http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/MVPcontroversy.html?partnersite=espn MVP Controversy], accessed, [[March 27]], [[2007]]</ref> Barkley finished second in MVP voting behind the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' [[Magic Johnson]]. He was named Player of the Year by both [[The Sporting News]] and Basketball Weekly.<ref name="nbaob"/> He averaged 25.2 points and 11.5 rebounds per game and a career high 60% field-goal percentage.<ref name="nbah"/> He was named to the All-NBA First Team for the third consecutive year and earned his fourth All-Star selection. He helped Philadelphia win 53 regular season games, only to lose to the Chicago Bulls in a five-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series.<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=PHI&yr=1989&lg=n 76ers 1989-90 Game Log and Scores], accessed, [[March 11]], [[2007]]</ref> Barkley averaged 24.7 points and 15.5 rebounds in another [[1990 NBA Playoffs|postseason]] loss.<ref name="cbcstats"/> His exceptional play continued into his [[1990-91 NBA season|seventh season]], where he averaged 27.6 points on 57% field goal shooting and 10.1 rebounds per game.<ref name="nbah"/> His fifth straight All-Star Game appearance proved to be his best yet. He led the East to a 116–114 win over the [[Western Conference (NBA)|West]] with 17 points and 22 rebounds, the most rebounds in an All-Star Game since [[Wilt Chamberlain]] recorded 22 in [[1966-67 NBA season|1967]].<ref name="nbaob"/> For his efforts, Barkley was presented with Most Valuable Player honors at the All-Star Game, and at the end of the season, named to the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year.<ref name="nbaob"/> In [[1991 NBA Playoffs|the postseason]], Philadelphia lost again to Jordan's Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Barkley contributing 24.9 points and 10.5 rebounds per game.<ref name="cbcstats"/>

The [[1991-92 NBA season|1991-92 season]] was Barkley's final year in Philadelphia. In his last season, he wore number 32 instead of his 34 to honor [[Magic Johnson]],<ref>''New York Times'', [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D81730F930A25752C1A967958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBarkley%2c%20Charles SPORTS PEOPLE: PRO BASKETBALL; Barkley Will Switch To Johnson's No. 32], [[November 13]], [[1991]]</ref> who announced prior to the start of the season that he was [[HIV]]-positive. Although the 76ers initially retired the number 32 in honor of [[Billy Cunningham]], it was unretired for Barkley to wear. Following Johnson's announcement, Barkley also apologized for having made light of his condition. Responding to concerns that players may contract HIV by contact with Johnson, Barkley flippantly stated, "We're just playing basketball. It's not like we're going out to have unprotected sex with Magic."<ref>Chris Weiskopf, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n7_v48/ai_18211328 Return of HIV-positive Magic Johnson -Column], ''[[National Review]]'', [[April 22]], [[1996]], accessed [[March 6]], [[2007]] </ref>

In his final season with the Sixers, averaging 23.1 points on 55.2% shooting and 11.1 rebounds per game,<ref name="nbah"/> Barkley earned his sixth straight All-Star appearance and was named to the All-NBA Second Team; his seventh straight appearance on either the first or second team. He ended his 76ers career ranked fourth in team history in total points (14,184), third in scoring average (23.3 ppg), third in rebounds (7,079), eighth in assists (2,276), and second in field-goal percentage (.576).<ref name="nbaob"/> He led Philadelphia in rebounding and field-goal percentage for seven consecutive seasons and in scoring for six straight years.<ref name="nbah"/> However, after several early-round playoff defeats, and with the Sixers failing to make [[1992 NBA Playoffs|the postseason]] in the 1991-92 season with a 35&ndash;47 record,<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://databasebasketball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=PHI&lg=n&yr=1991 Philadelphia 76ers: 1991 Stats, History, Awards, and More], accessed [[April 30]], [[2007]].</ref> Barkley demanded a trade out of Philadelphia.<ref name="nbabio"/> On [[July 17]], [[1992]], Barkley was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in exchange for [[Jeff Hornacek]], [[Tim Perry]] and [[Andrew Lang]].<ref name="nbabio"/>

During Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia, he became a household name, and was one of the few NBA players to have a figure published by [[Kenner]]'s [[Starting Lineup]] toy line and also had his own signature shoe line with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. However, his outspoken and aggressive play also caused a few scandals, notoriously a fight with [[Detroit Pistons]] center [[Bill Laimbeer]] in 1990, an event which drew record fines,<ref>Sam Goldpaper, [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F30614FC3E580C728EDDAD0894D8494D81 Basketball; Pistons and 76ers Receive 162,500 fine and 3 Bans], ''New York Times'', accessed, [[March 6]], [[2007]]</ref> and the infamous spitting incident.

===Spitting incident===
In March 1991, during an overtime game in [[New Jersey Nets|New Jersey]], a courtside [[heckler]] had been yelling racial epithets throughout the game at Barkley.<ref name="spitquo">Larry Platt, [http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/05/30/barkley/index1.html People: Charles Barkley], accessed, [[March 8]], [[2007]]. </ref> Upset by the heckler's remarks, Barkley turned to spit at him, but, as he later described, didn't "get enough foam", missed and mistakenly spat on a young girl.<ref name="spitquo"/> [[Rod Thorn]], the then-[[NBA]]'s president of operations, suspended Barkley without pay and fined him $10,000 for spitting and using abusive language at the fan.<ref>nytimes.com, [http://www.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/charles_barkley/index.html?offset=30&s=oldest& Pro Basketball: Barkley Fined and Suspended], accessed, [[March 8]], [[2007]]</ref> It became a national story and Barkley was vilified for it.<ref name="spitquo"/> However, Barkley eventually developed a friendship with the girl and her family.<ref name="nbabio"/> He apologized, and among other things, provided tickets to future games.<ref name="chuck">nba.com/encyclopedia, [http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/barkley_hoopiss5volXXVII.html You're a Good Man Charles Barkley!], accessed, [[March 8]], [[2007]]</ref> 

Upon retirement, Barkley was later quoted as stating, "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing—the spitting incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that I was getting way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning."<ref>sportsillustrated.com, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/jack_mccallum/news/2002/03/05/nba_insider/ SI's Jack McCallum: Sir Charles speaks], accessed, [[March 8]], [[2007]]</ref>

===Phoenix Suns===
The trade to Phoenix in the [[1992-93 NBA season|1992-93 season]] went well for both Barkley and the Suns. He averaged 25.6 points on 52% shooting, 12.2 rebounds, and a career high 5.1 assists per game,<ref name="nbah"/> leading the Suns to an NBA best 62–20 record. For his efforts, Barkley won the league's Most Valuable Player Award and was named to his seventh straight All-Star appearance. He became the third player ever to win league MVP honors in the season immediately after being traded, established multiple career highs, and led Phoenix to their first [[1993 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance since [[1975-76 NBA season|1976]].<ref name="nbaob"/> Despite Barkley's proclamation to Jordan, that it was ''[[destiny]]'' for the Suns to win the title, they were defeated in six games by the Bulls. He averaged 26.6 points and 13.6 rebounds per game during the postseason.<ref name="cbcstats"/>

As a result of severe back pains, Barkley began to speculate his last year in Phoenix during the [[1993-94 NBA season|1993-94 season]].<ref name="nbaob"/> Playing through the worst injury problems of his career, Barkley managed 21.6 points on 49.5% shooting and 11.2 rebounds per game.<ref name="nbah"/> He was selected to his eighth consecutive All-Star game, but did not play because of a torn right [[quadriceps tendon]],<ref name="nbaob"/> and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. With Barkley fighting injuries, the Suns still managed a 56–26 record and made it to the Western Conference Semifinals. But despite holding a 2–0 lead in the series,<ref name="Suns 1993-94">databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=PHO&yr=1993&lg=n Phoenix Suns  1993-94 Game Log and Scores], accessed [[March 6]], [[2007]]</ref> the Suns lost in seven games to the eventual champion [[Houston Rockets]].<ref name="Suns 1993-94"/> Despite his injuries, in Game 3 of a first-round playoff series against the [[Golden State Warriors]], Barkley hit 23 of 31 field-goal attempts and finished with 56 points, the then-third-highest total ever in a playoff game.<ref name="nbaob"/><ref name="cbcstats"/> After contemplating retirement in the offseason,<ref name="nbaob"/> Barkley returned for his [[1994-95 NBA season|eleventh season]] and continued to battle injuries.<ref name="nbabio"/> He struggled during the first half of the season,<ref name="nbaob"/> but managed to gradually improve, earning his ninth consecutive appearance in the All-Star Game.

The [[1995-96 NBA season|1995-96 season]] was Barkley's last on the Phoenix Suns. He led the team in scoring, rebounds, and steals, averaging 23.3 points on 50% field goal shooting, 11.6 rebounds, and a career high 77.7% free throw shooting.<ref name="nbah"/> He earned his tenth appearance in an All-Star Game as the top vote-getter among Western Conference players and posted his 18th career triple-double on [[November 22]].<ref name="cbcstats"/> He also became just the tenth player in NBA history to reach 20,000 points and 10,000 rebounds in their career.<ref name="nbaob"/><ref name="nbah"/> In the postseason, Barkley averaged 25.5 points and 13.5 rebounds per game in a four-game first round playoff loss to the [[San Antonio Spurs]].<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=PHO&yr=1995&lg=n Suns 1995-96 Game Log and Scores], accessed [[March 6]], [[2007]]</ref><ref name="cbcstats"/> After the Suns closed out the season with a 41–41 record and a first-round playoff loss, Barkley was traded to Houston in exchange for [[Sam Cassell]], [[Robert Horry]], [[Mark Bryant]], and [[Chucky Brown]].<ref name="rm">nytimes.com, [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70913FF3F540C7A8DDDA10894DE494D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBarkley%2c%20Charles Barkley Confirms Trade], accessed, [[March 13]], [[2007]]</ref>

During his career with the Suns, Barkley excelled as a player, earning All-NBA and All-Star honors in each of his four seasons. However, the always outspoken Barkley continued to stir up controversy during the 1993 season, when he famously claimed that sports figures should not be role models.<ref>salon.com, [http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/05/30/barkley/print.html Charles Barkley], accessed, [[March 13]], [[2007]]</ref>

===Role model controversy===
Throughout his career, Barkley had been arguing that athletes should not be considered [[role model]]s.<ref name="nbabio"/> He stated, "A million guys can dunk a basketball in jail, should they be role models?" In 1993, his argument prompted national news when he wrote the text for his "I am not a role model" Nike commercial. [[Dan Quayle]], the former [[Vice President of the United States]] called it a "family-values message" for Barkley's oft-ignored call for parents and teachers to quit looking to him to "raise your kids" and instead be role models themselves.<ref name="rm"/>

Barkley's message sparked a great public debate about the nature of role models. He argued, <blockquote>I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.<ref name="rm"/></blockquote>

Thirteen years later, on [[May 23]], [[2006]], [[ESPN Classic]] aired a "''[[The Top 5 Reasons You Can't Blame...]]''" episode on Barkley's controversial commercial. The show discussed five main reasons why they agreed with Barkley's "I am not a role model" message. The number one reason stated was, "He really wasn't a role model. Although many fans believed Barkley's candor made him one of the NBA's most lovable players, his behavior occasionally backed up his claims, like in the aforementioned 1991-92 season game where he spat on a 9-year old girl, and an incident in Orlando in which he threw a man through a window."

===Houston Rockets===
The trade to the Houston Rockets in the [[1996-97 NBA season|1996-97 season]] was Barkley's last chance at capturing an NBA championship title. He joined a veteran team that included two of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|NBA's 50 Greatest Players]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] and [[Clyde Drexler]]. He continued to battle injuries throughout the season and played only 53 games, missing fourteen because of a [[laceration]] and bruise on his left pelvis, eleven because of a sprained right ankle, and four due to suspensions.<ref name="nbaob"/> He became the team's second leading scorer, averaging 19.2 points on 48.4% shooting;<ref name="nbah"/> the first time since his rookie year that he averaged below 20 points per game. With Olajuwon taking most of the shots, Barkley focused primarily on rebounding, averaging 13.5 per game, the second best in his career.<ref name="nbah"/> The Rockets ended the regular season with a 57–25 record and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the [[Utah Jazz]].<ref name="nbaob"/> Barkley averaged 17.9 points and 12.0 rebounds per game in [[1997 NBA Playoffs|another postseason]] loss.<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=BARKLCH01 Barkley Stats], accessed [[March 16]], [[2007]]</ref>

Barkley competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic games]] and won two [[gold medal]]s as a member of the [[United States national basketball team|United States men's basketball team]]. In 1992, international rules, which had previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The result was the legendary [[United States national basketball team#The Original Dream Team|Dream Team]], which went 6–0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8–0 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points.<ref name="olympics">usabasketball.com, [http://www.usabasketball.com/history/moly_1992.html USA Basketball: Men's Olympics History (1992)], accessed, [[April 5]], [[2007]]</ref> Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single game scoring record with 30 points in a 127–83 victory over [[Brazil]].<ref name="olympics"/> He also set a U.S. Men's Olympic record for highest three point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game.<ref>usabasketball.com, [http://www.usabasketball.com/history/moly_records.html USA Basketball: USA Men's Olympic Records], accessed, [[April 5]], [[2007]]</ref>

At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Barkley led the team in scoring, rebounds, and field goal percentage. He averaged 12.4 points on 81.6% field goal shooting and 6.6 rebounds per game, as the team once again compiled a perfect 8–0 record and captured gold medal honors.<ref name="olympic2">usabasketball.com, [http://www.usabasketball.com/history/moly_1996.html USA Basketball: Men's Olympic History (1996)], accessed, [[April 5]], [[2007]]</ref>

==Player profile==
Barkley primarily played the [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] position. He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most [[small forward]]s, yet shorter than the league's power forwards. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying bigger players and overpowering smaller opponents.<ref name="nbaob"/> He was fluid on the [[fast break]], a powerful jumper, an accurate shooter, and one of the NBA's premier [[Clutch (sports)|clutch]] players.<ref name="nbaob"/> He was a prolific scorer who averaged 22.1 points per game for his career,<ref name="cbcstats"/> with the ability to score on the perimeter or finish inside with a powerful dunk. He scored with great efficiency and averaged 54.1% field goal accuracy for his career, including a career high 60% during the [[1989-90 NBA season]].<ref name="cbcstats"/>

He concluded his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power foward position,<ref name="d">basketball-reference.com, [http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/STL_career.html Career Leaders for Steals], accessed, [[March 28]], [[2007]]</ref> and despite being undersized, also finished among the All-Time leaders in blocked shots.<ref>basketball-reference.com, [http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/BLK_career.html Career Leaders for Blocks], accessed, [[April 8]], [[2007]]</ref>

Barkley's talents were perhaps best summarized by NBA Hall-of-Famer [[Bill Walton]]. In a [[SLAM Magazine|SLAM magazine]] issue ranking NBA greats, he stated, "Barkley is like [[Magic Johnson|Magic]] [Johnson] and [[Larry Bird|Larry]] [Bird] in that they don't really play a position. He plays everything; he plays basketball. There is nobody who does what Barkley does. He's a dominant rebounder, a dominant defensive player, a three-point shooter, a dribbler, a playmaker."<ref name="nbabio"/>

==Legacy==
During his sixteen year NBA career, Barkley was regarded as one of the most controversial, outspoken, and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went far beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring, and consistent play.<ref name="chuck"/> His larger than life persona and confrontational mannerisms often led to [[technical foul]]s and fines, and sometimes gave rise to national controversy; such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as [[role model]]s and famously declared, "I am not a role model."<ref name="classic">Bob Carter, [http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Barkley_Charles.html Sir Charles led the NBA in dunks, interviews], accessed [[April 15]], [[2007]].</ref> Although his words often lead to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth never caused trouble because it always spoke the truth.<ref name="chuck"/> He stated, "I don't create controversies. They're there long before I open my mouth. I just bring them to your attention."<ref name="nbabio"/> He was frequently fined for oncourt fights with NBA players, such as [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Bill Laimbeer]], and [[Charles Oakley]],<ref>Mike Wise, "Barkley Fight Costs Oakley Two Games and $11,000", ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[October 29]], [[1996]].</ref> among others. Off the court, he was equally confrontational. He was once arrested for breaking a man's nose during a fight after a game with the Milwaukee Bucks <ref>nytimes.com, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D71E38F930A15751C1A967958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBarkley%2c%20Charles Barkley Arrested After Fight], accessed [[April 15]], [[2007]].</ref> and also for throwing a man through a plate-glass window after being struck with a glass of ice.<ref>chronicle.augusta.com, [http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/102797/spo_barkley.html The Augusta Chronicle: Barkley arrested after bar scuffle], accessed [[April 15]], [[2007]].</ref> However, despite these occurrences Barkley continued to remain popular with the fans and media. In 1993, he was approached in a bar by a woman who wanted an autograph. She then asked for more than one, but after Barkley refused to sign more, she tore the first one and threw it into Barkley's face. He reacted by pouring a beer over her head.<ref name="beer">phoenixnewtimes.com, [http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1993-04-28/news/the-most-popular-man-in-phoenix/2 The Most Popular Man in Phoenix], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]].</ref> After the incident, the media and fans immediately blamed the woman, who later admitted to being "out of line."<ref name="beer"/> 

As a player, Barkley was a perennial [[NBA All-Star|All-Star]] who earned league [[NBA MVP|MVP honors]] in 1993.<ref name="nbabio"/> He employed a brusing physical style of play that earned him the nicknames "Sir Charles" and "The Round Mound of Rebound."<ref>"Charles Barkley." The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University</ref> He was named to the [[All-NBA]] team eleven times and earned two gold medals as a member of the United States Olympic Basketball team. He led both teams in scoring and was instrumental in helping the 1992 "Dream Team" and 1996 Men's Basketball team compile a perfect 16&ndash;0 record.<ref name="olympics"/><ref name="olympic2"/> He retired as one of only four players in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 4,000 assists in their career.<ref name="nbabio"/>

On [[March 30]], [[2001]], his number 34 jersey was officially retired by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]].<ref>Bob Ford, [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/comsite5/bin/pdinventory.pl?pdlanding=1&referid=2930is&purchase_type=ITM&item_id=0286-8403920 Lovefest for Charles Barkley, whose jersey number is retired. (Knight-Ridder/Tribune News Service report)], ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', accessed [[March 6]], [[2007]] </ref> On [[March 20]], [[2004]], in a game against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], Barkley's jersey was retired by the Suns, as he joined [[Connie Hawkins]], [[Tom Chambers]], [[Dan Majerle]], [[Walter Davis (basketball)|Walter Davis]], and [[Kevin Johnson]] in the "Suns Ring of Honor".

==Post-basketball life==
===Turner Network Television (TNT)===
Barkley currently works as a studio analyst for [[Turner Network Television]] (TNT). Barkley appears on the network's NBA coverage during pregame and halftime shows, in addition to special NBA events (such as the NBA [[slam dunk contest]] among others). Barkley also appears on an original program for the Network entitled ''[[Inside the NBA]]'', which has won numerous Emmy awards and has become renowned for Barkley's blunt yet humorous analysis. ''Inside the NBA'' is a [[post-game show]] during which the crew (Barkley, [[Ernie Johnson Jr.]], and [[Kenny Smith]]) recap the NBA games that occurred during the day and also comment on NBA affairs in general.

During a broadcast of a game which Barkley was courtside with [[Marv Albert]], Barkley poked fun of NBA official [[Dick Bavetta]]'s age, to which Albert responded "I believe Dick would beat you in a footrace." In spite of this remark, Barkley challenged Bavetta to a race at the [[2007 NBA All-Star Weekend]] for $50,000. The winner was to choose a charity to which the money would be donated. They raced three and a half lengths of the basketball court, and Barkley won.<ref name="Bavetta">Misener, Darren.  [http://www.nba.com/allstar2007/news/bavettabarkley_taletape.html "Bavetta vs. Barkley: Sir Charles Reigns"].  February 19, 2007.  NBA.com.  Accessed [[March 6]], [[2007]] </ref> In the past, Bavetta has been on the receiving end of many of Barkley's puns on his old age.

===Gambling===
In an interview with [[ESPN]]'s [[Trey Wingo]] on [[May 3]], [[2006]], Barkley revealed that he has lost approximately $10 million through [[gambling]].  Barkley was already known to be a heavy gambler, but the scope of his losses was not known until the interview.

Barkley admits that he has a gambling problem, but says it is not at serious as many others because he can afford it. On a [[February 3]], [[2007]] trip to Las Vegas, he claims to have won $700,000 from playing [[blackjack]] and betting on the [[Indianapolis Colts]] to defeat the [[Chicago Bears]] in [[Super Bowl XLI]].<ref>espn.com [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2755468 Barkley admits huge losses, big gains while gambling (AP report)], accessed [[March 6]], [[2007]] </ref>

Barkley also admits that he lost 2.5 million "in a six hour period" playing [[blackjack]] in 2006. He claims he is not upset about it.<ref>cbs.sportsline.com, [http://cbs.sportsline.com/nba/story/9977046 Barkley claims to have won $700K in Vegas over the weekend ], accessed [[March 6]], [[2007]] </ref>

===Politics===
Barkley spoke articulately for many years of his Republican Party affiliation and in 1995 considered running as a [[G.O.P.]] candidate for Alabama's governorship in the 1998 election.<ref>msnbc.com, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14051432/ Barkley renews talk of running for Ala. governor] (AP article), accessed [[January 12]], [[2007]].</ref> In 2006 he changed his political stance saying: <blockquote>I was a Republican until they lost their minds", "The word 'conservative' means 'discriminatory,' practically. It's a form of political discrimination. What do the Republicans run on? Against gay marriage and for a war that makes no sense. A war that was based on faulty intelligence. That's all they ever talk about. That and immigration. Another discriminatory argument for political gain.<ref>Chris Baldwin, [http://www.travelgolf.com/blogs/chris.baldwin/2006/07/17/charles_barkley_john_mellencamp_right_co Charles Barkley: John Mellencamp right, "Conservative means discriminatory"], [[July 17]], [[2006]].</ref></blockquote>

At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin, Florida, Barkley lent credence to the idea of his running for Governor of Alabama: <blockquote>I'm serious. I've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration. ... When I run - if I run - we're going to talk about real issues like improving our schools, cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people.<ref>Charles J. Dean,  [http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/index.ssf?/base/news/1153906206247070.xml&coll=2&thispage=1 Barkley may run in 2010], [[July 26]], [[2006]].</ref></blockquote>

In September 2006, Barkley reiterated his desire to run for Governor. "I can't run until 2014", he said.."<ref name="Gov">espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2576203 Barkley serious about running for Alabama governor] (AP article), accessed [[January 12]], [[2007]] </ref> "I have to live there for seven years, so I'm looking for a house there as we speak."<ref name="Gov"> </ref> And he said he is an independent, not a Democrat as previously reported. "The Republicans are full of it", Barkley said. "The Democrats are a little less full of it."<ref name="Gov"> </ref>

===Books===
In 2000, Barkley wrote the foreword for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' columnist [[Rick Reilly]]'s book ''The Life of Reilly''.  In it Barkley quipped, "Of all the people in sports I'd like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly's not one of them.  It's a shame though, skinny white boy looks ''real'' aerodynamic."

In 2002, Barkley released the book ''I May Be Wrong, But I Doubt It'', which included editing and commentary by close friend [[Michael Wilbon]].  In 2005, Barkley released ''Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?'', which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government. Michael Wilbon also contributed to this book and was present at many of the interviews.
