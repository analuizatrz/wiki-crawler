{{nihongo|'''''Chrono Trigger'''''|クロノ・トリガー|Kurono Torigā}} is a [[console role-playing game]] created by [[Square Co., Ltd.]] (now [[Square Enix]] Co., Ltd.) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was released in [[Japan]] on [[March 11]], [[1995]] and in [[North America]] on August 22 of the same year (see [[1995 in video gaming]]). The game's story follows a group of young adventurers who are accidentally transported through time and learn that the world will be destroyed in the distant future. Vowing to prevent this disaster, they travel throughout history to discover the means to save the planet. 

''Chrono Trigger'' was developed by a group called the "Dream Team"<ref name="Dream-team-name">'''Keizo Kokubo:''' Well then, open the Gates to the Dream Team! ... / '''Developer's Ending:''' Cheers! You made it to one of the endings! You're now a member of the Dream Team! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> or "Dream Project" consisting of [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], [[Kazuhiko Aoki]] and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], known for their works on the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, and [[Yuuji Horii]] and artist [[Akira Toriyama]], known for their works on the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series.

At the time of its release, certain aspects of ''Chrono Trigger'' were seen as revolutionary — including its multiple endings, plot-related [[Quest (gaming)#Side-quest|sidequests]] focused on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.<ref name="npreview1">{{Cite book | year=1995 | author=Averill, Alan | title=Nintendo Power July, 1995 | pages=52 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> It is still regarded by fans as one of [[Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever|the greatest games of all time]],<ref name="greatest-games">{{cite web | author=IGN staff | year=2005 | title=IGN's Top 100 games | url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/011-020.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN] | accessdate=July 2 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and was ported by [[TOSE]] and rereleased by [[Square Co.|Square]] in Japan for the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation]] during [[1999 in video gaming|1999]]. In [[2001 in video gaming|2001]], it was released in North America as part of ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' for the PlayStation, which also includes ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. It has never been released in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories.

==Gameplay==
''Chrono Trigger'' features standard [[console role-playing game|RPG]] gameplay, but with various innovations. As with most RPGs, the player assumes control of the protagonist and his companions throughout the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], consisting of various forests, cities, and [[Dungeon (computer game)|dungeons]]. Navigation is conducted via an [[overworld]] map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Locations such as cities and forests are represented by more realistically scaled field maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. However, ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay deviates from traditional RPGs in that, rather than [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the field map itself rather than on a separate battle screen.<ref name="npreview2">{{Cite book | year=1995 | author=Averill, Alan | title=Nintendo Power July, 1995 | pages=53 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> This concept had previously been featured in such titles as ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'', but was uncommon at the time for RPGs outside the [[Action role-playing game|action RPG]] genre.

[[Image:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG|thumb|256px|left|Example of a basic battle]]
More in line with traditional RPG elements, players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks and items to wound targets during battles. For both the playable characters and the [[central processing unit|CPU]]-controlled enemies, each attack reduces their number of [[hit point]]s (a numerically based [[life bar]]), which can be restored through potions or spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter—except for specific storyline-related battles that allow the player to lose. Players can equip characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power) in battle, and use various consumable items. These items and equipment may be purchased or found on field maps, often in [[Treasure chest (video games)|treasure chests]]. By exploring new areas and combating enemies, players progress through ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story.

''Chrono Trigger'' uses an [[Square Enix battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system, a staple of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series  that was designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''.<ref name="gafreview">{{cite web | author=Johnson, Robert | title=Final Fantasy IV Review | date=2003-04-28 | url=http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/review.php?reviewid=197 | work=http://www.gamesarefun.com/ GamesAreFun | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref>{{Fact|date=February 2007}} However, the variation used in ''Chrono Trigger'' is different than previous versions; the game is defined on-screen as running "Active Time Battle 2.0". Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer — dependent on the character's speed [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]] — counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques &mdash; such as sword abilities &mdash; are handled through a system called "Techs". Techs deplete a character's [[Magic point]]s (a numerical meter that works like Hit Points), and often have special [[area of effect|areas of effect]]; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques may be used.<ref name="npreview2" /> Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning ''Cyclone'' Tech can be combined with Lucca's ''Flame Toss'' to create ''Fire Whirl''. When characters with compatible Techs have enough Magic Points available to perform their techniques and are able to take action, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

[[Image:CTEpochshot.PNG|thumb|right|256px|The time machine Epoch]]
''Chrono Trigger'' features other unique gameplay traits, including [[time travel]]. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and actions taken in the past eras affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete peripheral quests and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called "time gates", as well as a [[Time travel|time machine]] named "[[Epoch (Chrono Trigger)|Epoch]]". Additionally, ''Chrono Trigger'' took advantage of [[Mode 7]] [[texture mapping]], employing the technique in a [[racing game|racing]] [[minigame]] and several [[cut scene]]s. The game also supports a [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] option. After completing the game, players may start the game over using data from the previous session. Character [[Experience point|levels]], learned [[Skill (role-playing games)|techniques]] and equipment and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. Other unusual features of ''Chrono Trigger'' are that it can be completed without the protagonist in the party and that it features multiple endings.<ref name="nppreview">{{Cite book | year=1995 | author=Averill, Alan | title=Nintendo Power June, 1995 | pages=37 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> The player's progress prior to the final battle determines which of thirteen endings — some with slight variations determined by small choices — the player will receive.<ref name="endings2">{{cite web | author=Pringle, Bill | year=2005 | title=Chrono Trigger Endings | url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/w/r/wrp103/wrp/ct_end.html | work=[http://www.personal.psu.edu/ Penn State Personal Web Server] | accessdate=May 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Moreover, some endings can only be viewed on a New Game+ session, in which the final boss can be challenged earlier than normally allowed. Square used the New Game+ concept in later titles, such as ''[[Vagrant Story]],'' ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve series|Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.

===Characters===
{{main|List of Chrono Trigger characters}}
[[Image:Chrono Trigger Magus battle artwork.PNG|thumb|256px|Crono, Lucca, and Frog battle Magus]]
''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s seven playable characters come from several different eras throughout the game world's history. The game begins in [[1000 A.D. (Chrono Trigger)|1000 A.D.]] with [[Crono]], [[Marle (Chrono Trigger)|Marle]] and [[Lucca (Chrono Trigger)|Lucca]]. Crono is a [[silent protagonist]], and characterized as a brave, fearless young man who is skilled in the use of the [[katana]], while Marle is actually Princess Nadia of the Guardia kingdom, an active, spirited [[tomboy]] often at odds with her father, the king. Lucca is a mechanical genius and — more comfortable around machinery than people — has few friends other than Crono. She has a passionate interest in science, fueled by an accident that claimed her mother's legs several years earlier, and her home is now filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From [[2300 A.D. (Chrono Trigger)|2300 A.D.]], [[Robo (Chrono Trigger)|Robo]] is a robot with a bright and curious personality created to assist humans. A worldwide disaster in [[1999 A.D. (Chrono Trigger)|1999 A.D.]] had rendered him dormant, but after he is found and repaired by Lucca, he joins the group out of gratitude.<ref name="characters">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Square Enix | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=32-33 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-01363}}</ref>

At the other end of the historical spectrum is [[Ayla (Chrono Trigger)|Ayla]], a prehistoric woman living in [[65,000,000 B.C. (Chrono Trigger)|65,000,000 B.C.]] Characterized as fierce, confident and unmatched in strength, Ayla is the chief of [[65,000,000 B.C. (Chrono Trigger)#Ioka Village|Ioka Village]] and has been leading her people in a war against the Reptites, evolved humanoid [[dinosaur]]s seeking dominance over the world. The last two characters to join the group come from [[600 A.D. (Chrono Trigger)|600 A.D.]] — [[Frog (Chrono Trigger)|Frog]] and the optional character [[Magus (Chrono Trigger)|Magus]], though the latter was born in the [[12000 B.C. (Chrono Trigger)|12000 B.C.]] era. Frog is a former [[squire]] originally named "Glenn"; his body was changed into that of a humanoid frog by Magus. After Magus slew his friend, Cyrus, and transformed him into a frog, Frog dedicated his life to protecting the queen of Guardia and avenging Cyrus by killing Magus. Blaming himself for failing his friend, Frog is depicted as chivalrous but mired in regret over the past. Magus is a powerful [[Magician|sorcerer]] and the leader of the Mystics, a race of demons and intelligent animals who war with humanity in this time period. Magus was originally called "[[Janus Zeal|Janus]]", and was the prince of the [[Kingdom of Zeal|Zeal kingdom]] in 12000 B.C. However, the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] entity known as "[[Lavos]]" destroyed his kingdom and sent him to the era of 600 A.D. when he was still a child. Desiring vengeance against Lavos, and concerned over the unknown fate of his sister, [[Schala]], he is portrayed as cynical and brooding.<ref name="characters" />

===Story===
''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story begins with the Millennial Fair of [[1000 A.D. (Chrono Trigger)|1000 A.D.]], a celebration of the [[millennium]] since the founding of the Kingdom of Guardia. The protagonist, Crono, is awakened by his mother and proceeds to Leene Square, where the fair is being held. After accidentally bumping into a girl named "Marle", they quickly become friends and visit the main attraction of the fair, a teleportation device constructed by Crono's inventor friend, Lucca. An eager volunteer, Marle disappears when the demonstration goes awry and reacts with her pendant, teleporting her through a mysterious portal, leaving only the pendant.<Ref name="portal">'''Taban:''' What's going on Lucca? WHERE IS SHE? / '''Lucca:''' The way she disappeared... It couldn't have been the Telepod! The warp field seemed to be affected by her pendant... {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Determined to find his new friend, Crono retrieves the discarded pendant and Lucca activates the machine once more, sending Crono through the same portal. He reappears in a forest grove, and upon finding a nearby town learns that he has gone back in time four hundred years. At Guardia Castle, he soon discovers Marle dressed in royal garb, and she reveals that the queen of Guardia in this era, Leene, has gone missing. A search party found Marle, and — mistaking her for the queen — brought her to the castle.<Ref name="shes-marle">'''Queen:''' Fooled you, didn't I, Crono? / '''Marle:''' It's me! But everyone calls me, Leene! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref>  A moment later, Marle vanishes once again and Lucca arrives, having created a device called the "Gate Key" that allows her to open nearby time portals.<ref name="gatekey">'''Lucca:''' Anyway, I call this thing a «Gate.» It's a kind of portal, that takes you to the same location in a different era. Gates are very unstable, so I used the principal behind my Telepod device... ...to create a «Gate Key.» Now we can use them as we please. {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Lucca determines that Marle is actually the princess of Guardia in 1000 A.D., and that the death of her missing ancestor could cause Marle to never exist. With the help of a talking, humanoid frog called "Frog", Crono and Lucca discover that Queen Leene was kidnapped by the "Mystics", intelligent animals and demonic creatures who worship the [[Wizard (character class)|wizard]] Magus. They then rescue her, save Marle and return to their own time period.

[[Image:CTLavos.jpg|thumb|right|256px|Lavos]]
There, Crono is placed on trial for allegedly kidnapping Marle. Through the manipulations of the king's chancellor, Crono is sentenced to death, but later breaks free from his prison. While making his escape, he locates Lucca and Marle, and the three flee into a nearby forest, where they are cornered by royal soldiers. There, the king asks Marle to return to his side, but she refuses due to his ill consideration of her friends and personal wishes. The three adventurers then stumble into a time gate activated by Lucca's Gate Key, and escape to a future era. There, they are shocked to find a devastated world filled with the ruins of advanced technology. While investigating a large dome structure, they discover a video recording of the destruction of the game world's surface, caused by a creature called "Lavos", who had been dwelling inside the planet's mantle until [[1999 A.D. (Chrono Trigger)|1999 A.D.]]<Ref name="dayoflavos">'''Marle:''' Say, what does this button do? / '''Lucca:''' 1999 A.D.?

Additionally, various time gates located here allow access to all eras significant to the storyline.

Crono and his friends return to 1000 A.D., and soon discover that Magus apparently created Lavos during the Middle Ages.<Ref name="lavos-created">'''Heckran:''' If only the great Magus who brought forth Lavos 400 years ago, had destroyed the human race! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> They return to [[600 A.D. (Chrono Trigger)|600 A.D.]] and learn that they must obtain a sword called the "Masamune" in order to defeat Magus, but that only the legendary "Hero" can wield it. After helping Guardia's knights defend against an assault from Magus' army, they climb the Denadoro mountains and discover from its guardians, Masa and Mune, that the Masamune is broken. It is soon revealed that the legendary Hero is actually Frog, who keeps the hilt of the Masamune, and that the sword was made by Melchior, a swordsmith living in Crono's time. Returning to 1000 A.D., Melchior informs Crono and his companions that they require Dreamstone, a rock only found in ancient times, to repair the Masamune. The player must then guide the adventurers to [[65,000,000 B.C. (Chrono Trigger)|65,000,000 B.C.]] via a time gate at the End of Time in order to locate the  mineral. There the party meets the cavewoman Ayla, who gives Crono Dreamstone after he wins a drinking contest with her. However, the Gate Key is stolen the next day by Reptites, advanced humanoid dinosaurs who are at war with humans, whom they refer to as "apes". Ayla helps Crono retrieve the Gate Key, and he and his friends return to Melchior's hut. With the aid of Lucca and Robo, Melchior repairs the blade, and Frog agrees to accompany Crono to Magus' castle and wield the Masamune against him.<Ref name="frog'sresolve">'''Frog:''' This sword...

[[Image:CTmeetmagus.JPG|thumb|left|256px|Confrontation with Magus]]
There, they fight Magus' generals — Ozzie, Flea and Slash — and an army of Mystics before facing Magus himself, who was in the process of casting a spell involving Lavos. Upon his defeat, he reveals that he did not create Lavos, but merely intended to summon it, and that the creature lies within the planet, siphoning its energy.<Ref name="only-summoned">'''Magus:''' You fools! I only «summoned» him! He lives in the inner earth, absorbing the land's power and growing ever stronger! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> The interruption of Magus' summon spell causes a massive time gate to open, swallowing Magus' castle and everyone within. Crono and his friends awaken in 65,000,000 B.C. once again, and after helping Ayla defeat the Reptites for a final time at their central fortress, it is revealed to the player that Lavos is an extraterrestrial life form that arrived on the world during this era. Discovering a new time gate at Lavos' impact crater, they visit the ancient, enlightened [[Kingdom of Zeal]] in [[12000 B.C. (Chrono Trigger)|12000 B.C.]], where they learn more about the creature. This floating kingdom had recently discovered Lavos, and — seeking to drain its power — constructed a conduit for the energy known as the "Mammon Machine" and a facility to house it called the "Ocean Palace". A mysterious prophet in Zeal warns the kingdom's queen about the adventurers, and they are forced to return to 65,000,000 B.C., with the time gate they used then sealed. Unable to return to Zeal via the time gate, they go to the End of Time for advice and learn of the Wings of Time, a time machine constructed by Belthasar, a Guru of Zeal sent to the far future. Locating the machine in [[2300 A.D. (Chrono Trigger)|2300 A.D.]], they rename it "Epoch" and return to 12000 B.C., where they learn that the Ocean Palace is soon to be activated. Rushing to the facility, they witness Lavos awakening, disturbed by the Mammon Machine. At this time, the prophet reveals himself to be Magus and attempts to destroy Lavos, but is defeated and his powers drained.<Ref name="magusrevealed">'''Magus:''' I've waited for this... I've been waiting for you, Lavos. I swore long ago... that I'd destroy you! No matter what the price! It is time to fulfill that vow. Feel my wrath, Lavos!! ... / '''Magus:''' Aaah!! My powers are being drained! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref>

Crono then challenges the creature, attempting to save the lives of his companions, but Crono is killed, his body vaporized by the monster. Lavos then destroys the entire kingdom, transports its prince, Janus, to the Middle Ages, and sends the three Gurus — Melchior, Belthasar and a man named "Gaspar" — to various places throughout time. Before the remaining party members and Magus can be killed, Schala, Zeal's princess, saves them by transporting them out of the palace and to the only remaining human settlement while she remains behind. However, Crono's friends have little time to grieve before Dalton, a former leader of security in the kingdom, arrives at the village and declares himself ruler of the world. Having saved the Blackbird — an ornate airplane — from destruction, he interns the party aboard and takes to the sky. Additionally, Dalton impounds the Epoch, and has his henchmen give it flight capabilities. The party soon escapes, however, and defeats Dalton in a battle atop the redesigned Epoch, which the adventurers then use to accidentally blast the Blackbird while they escape. Distraught over Crono's death, they meet with Magus, who reveals that he is Janus Zeal, and grew up in the Middle Ages waiting for a chance to get revenge on Lavos.<ref name="janus">'''Magus:'''Behold. Everything's at the bottom of the sea. Gone is the magical kingdom of Zeal, and all the dreams and ambitions of its people. I once lived there...

He gives them an egg-shaped device called the "Chrono Trigger", which he explains allows for a special form of time travel. Following his instructions, they soon use the device to visit the moment of Crono's death and freeze it in time, extracting him from the moment just before he would have been killed.

[[Image:CTsceneforest.JPG|thumb|right|256px|The group reunited]]
With the team reassembled, the group visits Gaspar once again, who relates various issues affecting the world across the eras. He suggests that participating in these optional [[Quest (gaming)|sidequests]] will help the party prepare for Lavos.<ref name="itll-help">'''Gaspar:''' Just as you touch the lives of every life form you meet, so, too, will their energy strengthen you. {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Traveling to 600 A.D., they defeat a creature named "Retinite" who caused a forest to become a desert. To help cultivate the forest and ensure its survival, the party leaves Robo behind, and he spends the next several hundred years working to maintain the land. Returning to pick him up in 1000 A.D., the group holds a campfire reunion in the forest and speculate that the gates through time were created by an entity other than Lavos, who wished for the adventurers to travel through time and fulfill a specific purpose.<ref name="entity">'''Robo:''' After 400 years of experience, I have come to think that Lavos may not be responsible for the Gates. / '''Marle:''' What do you mean? / '''Robo:''' I have come to think that someone, or something wanted us to see all this. {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> After the group falls asleep, a mysterious red time gate appears, which Lucca enters. Traveling to 990 A.D., Lucca has the opportunity to save her mother from the accident that cost her the use of her legs. The incident prompts Lucca's younger self to take up an interest in machinery so that she can prevent any future accidents.

Later, in 1000 A.D., the party learns that the ghost of Frog's friend, Cyrus, is haunting ancient ruins near a town.

On another journey, the party embarks to find the Sun Stone, a mythical artifact once used as a power source in Zeal. They locate it in a lost stronghold of the kingdom, uprooted from the sea floor in 2300 A.D., but learn that its power has burnt out. Taking it to 65,000,000 B.C., they leave it to recharge over the course of millions of years, but later find that it was looted in 1000 A.D. In order to coax it from its captor, the greedy [[1000 A.D. (Chrono Trigger)#Porre|Porre]] mayor, they travel to 600 A.D. and teach charity to his ancestor by giving food to him and his wife. With the Sun Stone secured, in 600 A.D. they soon discover another legendary artifact, the Rainbow Shell. Located in the underground remains of the Reptite fortress — preserved since its destruction in 65,000,000 B.C. — the large shell is too large for the group to remove, so they procure the aid of the Middle Age's King Guardia XXI, who stores the large shell in Guardia Castle. However, when the party returns to 1000 A.D., they find that Marle's father, King Guardia XXXIII, is being put on trial by his own chancellor for allegedly attempting to sell the shell, now a royal heirloom.<ref name="shell">'''Chancellor:''' It's an ancestral will. It says, «Unveil the Rainbow Shell to the people at the Millienal Fair.» / '''King:''' What are you talking about?! We have no family heirlooms here! '''Chancellor:''' So this is a forgery?

He sold the heirloom for cash! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Crono and his companions soon publicly reveal the chancellor to be a Mystic imposter, defeat him and help Marle and her father put their differences aside. 

Finally, the adventurers infiltrate the arisen Ocean Palace — now called the "Black Omen" — where Queen Zeal still resides, having survived Lavos' destruction of her kingdom and become a puppet to the creature's power. The party defeats the corrupted queen and destroys the Mammon Machine at the heart of the palace, causing the entire facility to be disintegrated. A final confrontation with Lavos itself follows, in which the party first penetrates the creature's shell, and then discovers that Lavos has been harvesting [[DNA]] on the planet in self-directed evolution while absorbing the energy produced.<ref name="lavos-purpose">'''Magus:''' ......So...since the dawn of time, it has slept underground, controlling evolution on this world for his own purpose... {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Presented with the results of Lavos' controlled genetics, they confront its true form and finally destroy the creature. 

The actual ending of the game depends on when the player defeated Lavos, as well as some other choices that can produce minor variations.  The first time through the game, team members say their goodbyes during the last night of the Millennial Fair and return to their own eras in time. Additionally, if Magus joined the party earlier, it is revealed that he now plans to search for his missing sister, Schala. Crono's mom then accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, however, prompting Crono, Marle and Lucca to set out in the Epoch on another adventure to find her while fireworks light up the night sky.<ref name="crono'smom">'''Mom:''' Look, Crono!

==Development==
''Chrono Trigger'' was produced by [[Kazuhiko Aoki]] and directed by [[Akihiko Matsui]], [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]]. The development of the game was supervised by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], producer and creator of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, and [[Yuuji Horii]], director and creator of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series. Yuuji Horii worked on the general outline of the story; as a fan of [[time travel in fiction|time travel]] fictions, such as the TV series ''[[Time Tunnel]]'', he focused on a theme of time travel for ''Chrono Trigger''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Yuji Horii interview | url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showGamePage&Game_ID=169 | author=Play staff |work=[http://playmagazine.com/ play Magazine Online] | publisher=Fusion Publishing, Inc. | accessdate=February 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The outline was subsequently edited and completed by [[Masato Kato]], who notably wrote all the events of the [[12,000 B.C. (Chrono Trigger)|12,000 B.C.]] era of the game's world. Finally, [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]] created the different sub-scenarios.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Procyon_Studio.html |title=Interview with Masato Kato |accessdate=2007-02-16 |author=Procyon Studio staff |year=1999 |month=November |publisher=[http://www.chronocompendium.com Chrono Compendium]}}</ref>

The characters of the game were designed by [[Akira Toriyama]], creator of the [[manga]] ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' and also known for his works on the ''Dragon Quest'' series. Among the other designers who participated in the development were notably [[Tetsuya Takahashi]], working as a graphic director, and [[Yasuyuki Honne]], [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and [[Yusuke Naora]], working among others as field graphic designers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_Credits.html |title=Chrono Trigger Credits |accessdate=2007-02-16 |author=Chrono Compendium staff |work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com Chrono Compendium]}}</ref>

==Audio==
{{main|Chrono Trigger Original Sound Version}}
''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[soundtrack]] was scored by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] and the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series' veteran composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The game was the first for which Mitsuda had served as composer, but after he contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu was brought onto the project to compose ten songs.<ref name="powerup">{{Cite book | year=2004 | author=[[Chris Kohler|Kohler, Chris]] | title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]] | publisher=DK Publishing | language=English | id=ISBN 0-7440-0424-1}}</ref> At the time of the game's release, the quantity of its tracks and sound effects were unprecedented,<ref name="npreview1" /> and the soundtrack was released as a three-disc collection. Additionally, a one-disc [[acid jazz]] arrangement called "''Brink of Time''" was also released. Later, another one-disc soundtrack was produced to complement the PlayStation rerelease of the game, featuring the [[orchestra]]l tracks used in [[cut scene]]s. Yasunori Mitsuda also composed four new pieces for the game's bonus features, though they were not included on the rerelease soundtrack. Recently, Yasunori Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the ''Chrono'' series for [[Play! A Video Game Symphony|Play!]] video game music concerts, presenting the main theme, "Frog's Theme", and "To Far Away Times".<ref name="nsider">{{cite web | date=2006-30-05 | author=Driker, Brandon |  title=Play!

The soundtrack has been heavily [[remix]]ed by fans, with more than 300 tributes,<ref name="tracks">{{cite web | title=Music (Chrono Trigger) | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Music_(Chrono_Trigger) | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=May 8 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and a handful of cover performance albums sold at retail. These include ''[[Time & Space - A Tribute to Yasunori Mitsuda]]'' and ''Chrono Symphonic''. The latter was released by remix website [[OverClocked ReMix]], and sought to provide an orchestrated score to an amateur script for a hypothetical ''Chrono Trigger'' [[film]]. Additionally, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] production team [[Compromised]] created a [[bastard pop]] album known as ''The Chrono Trigger Mixtape, Vol. 1'', produced by mixing the [[a cappella]] from rap songs with the [[instrumental]] remixed versions of ''Chrono Trigger'' songs.<ref name="mixtape">{{cite web | year=2005 | author=Comprised | title=Chrono Trigger Mixtape vol. 1 | url=http://chronotriggermixtape.com | work=[http://chronotriggermixtape.com Chrono Trigger Mixtape] | accessdate=May 7 | accessyear=2006 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060228212758/http://chronotriggermixtape.com/ | archivedate=2006-02-08}}</ref> Japanese fans often sell their remix work in compilation albums popularly called "''[[dojin]]''" by western fans.<ref name="tracks">{{cite web | title=Japanese Doujins | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Japanese_Doujins | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=December 16 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Reception and criticism==
''Chrono Trigger'' has sold more than 2.36 million copies in Japan and 290,000 abroad.<ref name="square-sales">{{cite web | date=2003-08-04 | author=Square Enix staff | title=Square Enix IR Roadshow Document | url=http://www.square-enix.com/jp/ir/e/explanatory/download/0404-200308040000-01.pdf | work=[http://www.square-enix.com/jp/index_f2.html Square Enix Japan] | accessdate=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The first two million copies sold in Japan were delivered in only two months.<ref name="nppreview2">{{Cite book | year=1995 | author=Averill, Alan | title=Nintendo Power June, 1995 | pages=36 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> The game was met with substantial success upon release in North America,<ref name="gamerankings">{{cite web | editor=Game Rankings staff | title=Chrono Trigger Reviews | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/563538.asp | work=[http://www.gamerankings.com/ Game Rankings] | accessdate=May 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="ign-review">{{cite web | date=2001-07-04 | author=IGN staff | title=IGN: Final Fantasy Chronicles Review | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/166/166322p1.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN] | accessdate=May 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and its rerelease on the PlayStation as part of the ''Final Fantasy Chronicles'' package topped the [[NPD Group|NPD]] TRSTS PlayStation sales charts for over six weeks.<ref name="FFC-Sales">{{cite web | date=2001-08-15 | author=Wollenschlaeger, Alex | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles Tops Sales Charts Six Weeks in a Row | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2001/081501d.html | work=[http://www.rpgamer.com/ RPGamer] | accessdate=May 8 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This version was later rereleased again in [[2003 in video gaming|2003]] as part of Sony's [[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]] line, and, in recent times, ''Chrono Trigger'' has placed highly on all three of multimedia website [[IGN]]'s "top 100 games of all time" lists. On the first, in 2002, the game placed 4th, while placing 6th on the second in early 2005, 13th on the third list in late 2005, and 2nd on the list for 2006.<ref name="greatest-games" />

''Chrono Trigger'' was not only a best-seller, but also well received critically. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' called it Square's "biggest game ever", citing improved graphics, sound, and gameplay over past RPG titles,<ref name="npreview1" /> while ''[[Official PlayStation Magazine|Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' described it as "original and extremely captivating", expressing particularly favorable responses to its graphics, sound and story.<ref name="loadtime">{{Cite book | year=2001 | editor=Kennedy, Sam | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=107 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc.}}</ref> Additionally, IGN commented that "it may be filled with every imaginable console RPG cliché, but ''Chrono Trigger'' manages to stand out among the pack" with "a [captivating] story that doesn't take itself too serious" and "one of the best videogame soundtracks ever produced".<ref name="ign-review" />

However, other critics, such as the staff of video game websites [[RPGFan]] and [[RPGamer]], have questioned the game's length, as it is shorter than most RPGs, and noted that its difficulty level is low as compared to many other RPGs.<ref name="playtime1">{{cite web | author=Adam, Riley | date=2003-01-29 | title=Chrono Trigger Review | url=http://www.cubed3.com/review/185/2/ | work=[http://www.cubed3.com/ Cubed3] | accessdate=June 27 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><Ref name="playtime2">{{cite web | year=2001-10-30 | editor=RPGFan staff | title=RPGFan Reviews - Chrono Trigger | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/chronotrigger/Chrono_Trigger-6.html | work=[http://www.rpgfan.com/ RPGFan] | accessdate=July 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="FFC-Sales" /> Overall, however, they regarded ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s replay value as high due to the game's multiple endings, its gameplay as simple but innovative, and its story as "fantastic yet not overly complex".

Moreover, the game was included in [[GameSpot]]'s "The Greatest Games of All Time" list released in April 2006,<ref name="gamespot-greatestgame">{{cite web | date=2006-04-17 | editor=GameSpot editorial team | title=The Greatest Games of All Time | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/index.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessdate=May 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and also appeared as 28th on an "All Time Top 100" list in a poll conducted by Japanese [[video game magazine|magazine]] ''[[Famitsu]]''.<ref name="nextgen">{{cite web | author=Campbell, Colin | date=2006-03-03 | title=Japan Votes on All Time Top 100 | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2401&Itemid=2 | work=[http://www.next-gen.biz Next Generation] | accessdate=May 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

A few months prior to ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s market release, a [[Development stage#Beta|beta version]] was given to magazine reviewers and game stores. An unfinished build of the game, it contains numerous differences from the final version, such as unused music tracks and a location called "Singing Mountain".<ref>{{cite web | editor=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Chrono Trigger Prerelease | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_Prerelease | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=May 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="singing-mountain">{{cite web | editor=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Singing Mountain | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Singing_Mountain | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=May 9 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Curious fans later explored the [[ROM image]] through various methods, discovering two unused world map character sprites and presumed additional sprites for certain [[non-player character]]s. This has led some to rumor that an eighth playable character exists or was intended for play,<ref name="exploration">{{cite web | editor=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Explore (CTP) | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Explore_(CTP).html | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=July 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> but there is no evidence to this claim.<ref name="playableextras">{{cite web | editor=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Extra Playable Characters (CTP) | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Extra_Playable_Characters_(CTP).html | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=May 9 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The game's formal release — now commonly sold on auction sites<ref name="rarity guide">{{cite web | editor=Santulli, Joe | title=Digital Press - Chrono Trigger | url=http://www.digitpress.com/DP/cmf/game.cmf?gameid=13212 | work=[http://www.digitpress.com/ Digital Press] | accessdate=June 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> — included two world maps, and Japanese buyers who preordered the game received [[holography|holographic]] foil cards. This release used a 32-[[megabit]] [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]] with battery-backed [[Random access memory|RAM]] for [[saved game]]s, and didn't require any special on-cartridge coprocessors. 

[[Image:CTendscreen.jpg|200px|left|thumb|An example of one of the anime cut scenes in the PlayStation rerelease]]
An enhanced [[porting|port]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' for the Sony PlayStation was developed by [[TOSE]] and released by [[Square Co.|Square]] in Japan in 1999. This port was later released in North America in 2001 — along with a [[remaster]]ed version of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' — under the package title "''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]''". This version included [[anime]] cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's [[Bird Studio]] and animated by [[Toei Animation]], as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. This version has received negative criticism for lengthy load times not present in the original.<ref name="loadtime" /> The PlayStation version's color palette also suffered in the translation, and a loss of detail was noticeable from the original. Whether ''Chrono Trigger'' will appear on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console (Wii)|Virtual Console]] depends on the settlement of certain copyright issues.<ref name="cubed3">{{cite web | author=Adam Riley | date=[[2002-02-01]] | title=No FFXI on Wii, FF Anniversary Projects on Nintendo Systems, Chrono Update & Much More! | url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/6729/1/No_FFIX_on_Wii,_FF_Anniversary_Projects_Nintendo_Systems,_Chrono_Update_&_Much_More! | work=[http://www.cubed3.com Cubed3.com] | accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref>

There have been two notable attempts by ''Chrono Trigger'' fans to unofficially remake parts of the game for [[personal computer|PC]] with a [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] engine.

==Sequels==
''Chrono Trigger'' inspired a variety of [[sequel]]s and [[spin-off]] titles. A 16-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]] entitled "''[[Nuumamonja: Time and Space Adventures]]''" was released in 1996. Additionally, three titles were released for the [[Satellaview]] in 1995, and a fourth in 1996. The first three were ''Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special'', a [[racing game]] based on a [[minigame]] from the original, ''Chrono Trigger: Character Library'', featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game, and ''Chrono Trigger: Music Library'', a collection of music from the game's soundtrack. The contents of ''Character Library'' and ''Music Library'' were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of ''Chrono Trigger''.

The fourth title, ''[[Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Houseki]]'', is a [[side story]] to ''Chrono Trigger'' created to resolve a loose subplot from its predecessor.<Ref name="weeklyfamitsu">{{cite web | year=1999 | title=Weekly Famitsu | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Weekly_Famitsu.html | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=July 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> A short, [[Interactive fiction|text-based game]] relying on minimal graphics and atmospheric music, the game never received an official release outside Japan, though it was later [[fan translation|fan translated]] to English.<ref name="fantranslation">{{cite web | date=2003-04-15 | title=Chrono Trigger 2: Radical Dreamers | url=http://radicaldreamers.sourceforge.net/ | work=[http://demiforce.parodius.com/home.html Demiforce] | accessdate=July 2 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Elements of its plot, including characters and setting, were later adapted to form the early sequences of a better known PlayStation sequel, ''[[Chrono Cross]]''. ''Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Houseki'' was consequently removed from the series' main continuity and referred to as another dimension during ''Chrono Cross''.<Ref name="radicalcontinuity">'''Kid:''' Radical Dreamers...!? And me name's on here, too! What the bloody hell is goin' on? ... / '''Kid:''' ......This seems to be an archive from a different time than our own. Aside from the two worlds we already know about...there may be other worlds and times which exist... {{cite video game | title =Chrono Cross | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square EA | date=2000-08-15 | platform =PlayStation | language=English }}</ref>

There are no plans for additional titles in series, despite a 2001 statement from Hironobu Sakaguchi that the development team of ''Chrono Cross'' wanted to make a new ''Chrono'' game and that script ideas were being considered.<ref name="chrono3discussion">{{cite web | author=Shahed Ahmed | date=2001-07-03 | title=New Chrono game in planning stages | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2782608.html?q=chrono | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessdate=July 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The same year, Square applied for a trademark for the names "''[[Chrono Break]]''" and "''Chrono Brake''" in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]], respectively.
