[[Image:Adf.jpg|thumb|The Australian Defence Force tri-service badge]]
The '''[[Australia]]n Defence Force''' currently numbers about 51,000 full-time active duty personnel and 19,400 reservists. The ADF, although small numerically, is technologically sophisticated. It is the largest force in [[Oceania]], and plays a significant role in peacekeeping operations around the world. The ADF's main strategic rivals are within the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.

The Australian Defence Force was established in 1976 to better coordinate the activities of the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Australian Army]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. Over time the ADF has become increasingly integrated, with tri-service headquarters and training institutions supplanting some single service establishments. 

==Role==
===Legal standing===

The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is constituted under the Executive Government sections of the [[Australian Constitution]]. Section 51(vi) gives the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] the power to make laws regarding Australia's defence and defence forces. Section 114 of the Constitution prevents the States from raising defence forces without the permission of the Commonwealth and Section 119 gives the Commonwealth responsibility for defending Australia from invasion and sets out the conditions in which the defence force can be used domestically.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 4 and Australian Attorney-General's Department [http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/pasteact/1/641/top.htm Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act].</ref>

The command arrangements for the ADF are set out in Section 68 of the Constitution which states that "the command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] as the [[Monarchy in Australia|Queen's]] representative." (no mention of the Air Force is made in the Constitution as aircraft had not been invented. Subsidiary and subsequent legislation handles these matters). In practice, however, the Governor General does not play any part on the ADF's command structure and the ADF is under the control of the elected [[Australian Government]]. This control is exercised by the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] and several subordinate ministers. The Minister acts on most matters alone, though important matters are considered by the National Security Committee of [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]]. The Minister then advises the Governor-General who acts as advised in the normal form of [[executive government]].<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 4.</ref>

[[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] of the ADF are commissioned by a document personally signed by the Governor-General, which is considered as a 'Queen's Commission'.

===Current priorities===

The 2000 Defence White Paper states that the Australian Defence Force has three main priorities:<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2000). [http://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper/docs/WPAPER.PDF ''Defence 2000 - Our Future Defence Force'']. Australian Department of Defence, Canberra. Pages 46-53.</ref>
#Maintaining the capability to defend Australian territory from any credible attack, without relying on help from the combat forces of any other country. 
#Contributing to the security of Australia's immediate neighbourhood through working with Australia's neighbours and participating in [[United Nations]]-sanctioned [[peacekeeping]] operations.
#Contributing to international coalitions of forces outside of Australia's immediate neighbourhood where Australian interests are engaged. 
The ADF is also responsible for contributing to coastal surveillance and responding to emergencies, including natural disasters.

The most recent governmental review of Australia's national security policies, ''Australia's National Security: Defence Update 2005'', states that "terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the consequences of state fragility and failure remain the most immediate strategic challenges for Australia." The ADF's role in countering these threats includes working with regional militaries, participating in international coalitions in areas distant to Australia and being prepared to conduct offshore evacuation and peacekeeping operations at short-notice.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2005). ''[http://www.defence.gov.au/update2005/ Australia's National Security: Defence Update 2005].'' Internet summary accessed 21 December 2006. Australian Department of Defence, Canberra.</ref> 
==History==
:''Main Articles: [[Military history of Australia]], [[History of the Royal Australian Navy]], [[History of the Australian Army]], [[History of the Royal Australian Air Force]]''
===The formation of the Australian Defence Force===
[[Image:Melbourne Midway small.JPG |thumb|The retirement of [[HMAS Melbourne (1945)|HMAS ''Melbourne'']] without replacement in 1982 marked a shift away from the policy of forward defence.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 55.</ref>]]
Australia has maintained military forces since its [[Federation of Australia|federation as a nation]] in January [[1901]]. The [[Australian Army]] and Commonwealth Naval Force were established upon Federation. The [[Royal Australian Navy]] was established in [[1909]] and absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Australian Flying Corps was established as part of the Army in 1912 and was separated to form the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in [[1921]]. All of the Australian services saw action around the world during [[Military history of Australia during World War I|World War I]] and [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]].

The importance of [[Joint warfare|'joint' warfare]] to was made clear to the Australian Military during [[World War II]] when Australian ground, air and naval forces served as part of single commands. Following the war several senior officers lobbied for the appointment of a [[commander in chief]] of the three services. This proposal was rejected, however, and the three services remained fully independent.<ref> David Horner (2001). ''Making the Australian Defence Force''. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. Page 42.</ref> In [[1958]] the position of Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee was established to advise the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] on the overall views of the three services.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 43.</ref> Due to the lack of a central authority the different services' force structures were not coordinated and the services operated in accordance to different [[Military doctrine|doctrines]].<ref>Horner (2001). Page 44.</ref>

[[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|The Australian Military's experiences during the Vietnam War]] highlighted the need for an integrated command structure and greater emphasis on 'joint' operations.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 44.</ref> In [[1973]] the Secretary of the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], [[Arthur Tange]], submitted a report to the [[Australian Government]] which recommended the creation of a single Department of Defence and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. These recommendations were accepted and the Australian Defence Force was established on [[9 February]] [[1976]].<ref>Horner (2001). Page 47.</ref>

===The Defence of Australia era===
[[Image:Kangaroo 89.jpg|thumb|left|Australian soldiers lead a column of American troops during Kangaroo '89. The Kangaroo series of exercises were important in developing joint procedures in the ADF and gave the ADF an opportunity to exercise with allied militaries in northern Australia.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 65.</ref>]]
Until the 1970s Australia's military strategy was centred on the concept of '[[forward defence]]', in which the role of the Australian military was to cooperate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region. Due to the introduction of the United States' [[Guam Doctrine]] of 1969 and the British withdrawal from '[[East of Suez|east of Suez]]' in the 1970s  Australia developed a defence policy which emphasised self-reliance and the defence of the Australian continent from external attack. This policy was known as the [[Defence of Australia Policy|Defence of Australia (DOA) Policy]]. Under DOA the focus of Australian defence planning was to protect Australia's northern maritime approaches (the 'air-sea gap') against enemy attack.<ref>Alex Tewes, Laura Rayner and Kelly Kavanaugh (2004) ''[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rb/2004-05/05rb04.htm Australia's Maritime Strategy in the 21st century]''. Australian Parliamentary Library Research Brief no. 4 2004–05.</ref> In line with this goal, the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases. This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF and relocating regular Army units to [[northern Australia]].<ref>Horner (2001). Page 72.</ref>

At the time the ADF was established no Australian military units were deployed on operations outside Australia. It was not until 1987 that the ADF made its first operational deployment when, as part of [[Operation Morris Dance]], several warships and a rifle company were deployed to the waters off [[Fiji]] in response to the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état]]. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforseen events.<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 225-227.</ref> 

From the late 1980s the Australian government increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to [[Namibia]] in early 1989, [[Cambodia]] between 1992 and 1993, [[Operation Solace|Somalia in 1993]], [[Rwanda]] between 1994 and 1995 and [[Bouganville]] in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 228-255.</ref> 

The [[Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War]] was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF. Although the warships and [[Clearance Diving Team (RAN)|clearance diving team]] deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] did not see combat, the deployment tested the ADF's capabilities and command structure. Following the war the Navy regularly deployed a [[List of recent Australian warship deployments to the Middle East|frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea]] to enforce the [[Iraq sanctions|trade sanctions imposed on Iraq]].<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 231-237.</ref>

===East Timor and after===
[[Image:1RAR.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|1 RAR]] arrive in the Solomon Islands in late 2004 to reinforce the [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]]]]
The election of the Conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] government headed by Prime Minister [[John Howard]] in 1996 lead to significant reforms to the ADF and the adoption of a more proactive defence strategy. Since 1997 Australia's defence strategy has placed greater emphasis on working in cooperation with regional states and [[Foreign relations of Australia|Australia's allies]] to manage potential security threats.<ref>Australian Army (2002). [http://www.defence.gov.au/ARMY/LWD1/LWD1sitemap.htm ''The Fundamentals of Land Warfare'']. Annex B.</ref>

The ADF's experiences during the deployment to [[East Timor]] in 1999 led to significant changes in Australia's defence policies and an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. In 2000 the Australian Government released a new Defence White Paper, ''Defence 2000 - Our Future Defence Force'', which placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. In order to improve the ADF's capabilities ''Defence 2000'' commited the Government to improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing [[Real versus nominal value|real]] Defence expenditure by 3% per year.<ref>Mark Thomson (2005b). [http://www.ada.asn.au/defender/Winter%202005/Easier%20Said%20Than%20Done%20(Defender,%20Winter%202005).pdf 'Easier Said Than Done: At the Six-year Mark in Remaking the ADF'] in ''Defender'', Winter 2005. Page 11.</ref> This focus on expeditionary operations was emphasised in the ''Defence Updates'' released in 2003 and 2005 and has resulted in an expansion and modernisation of the ADF and improvements to its ability to deploy overseas.<ref>Thomson (2006a). Pages 7-8.</ref>

The ADF's expanded force structure and deployment capabilities have been put to the test on a number of occasions since 2000. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the United States Australia committed a [[special forces]] task group and an [[air-to-air refuelling]] aircraft to operations in [[Afghanistan]] and naval warships to the [[Persian Gulf]] as [[Operation Slipper]]. In 2003 approximately 2000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 [[F/A-18 Hornet]] aircraft from [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No. 75 Squadron]], took part in the [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Later in 2003 elements of all three services deployed to the [[Solomon Islands]] as part of the [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]]. In late 2004 over 1000 ADF personnel deployed to Indonesia in [[Operation Sumatra Assist]] following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].<ref>Australian Minister for Defence media release [http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/HillTpl.cfm?CurrentId=4739 ''ADF Head Home from Aceh'']. 24 March 2005.</ref> In May 2006 approximately 2000 ADF personnel deployed to [[Timor Leste]] (East Timor) in [[Operation Astute]] following unrest between elements of the [[Timor Leste Defense Force]].

==Current structure==
[[Image:ADF chiefs.jpg|thumb|The current commanders of the Australian military. Left to Right: Air Marshal Geoffrey Shepherd (CAF), Lieutenant General Peter Leahy (CA), Air Chief Marshal [[Angus Houston]] (CDF), Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie (VCDF) and Vice Admiral Russ Shalders (CN)]]
The Australian Defence Force consists of the '''[[Royal Australian Navy]]''' (RAN), the '''[[Australian Army]]''' and the '''[[Royal Australian Air Force]]''' (RAAF). The Australian [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] administers the [[Australian Defence Organisation]] (ADO) which consists of the ADF and the civilian personnel supporting the ADF. The civilian support consists of activities such as the [[Defence Intelligence Organisation]] (DIO), the [[Defence Materiel Organisation]] (DMO) which purchases and maintains defence equipment, and the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] (DSTO) which provides science and technology support to the defence forces. 

===Command arrangements===
The [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] is the most senior appointment in the ADF.  The CDF commands the ADF under the direction of the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister of Defence]], and is notionally coequal with the Secretary of Defence, the most senior public servant in the Department of Defence. The CDF is the only four-star officer in the ADF and is a [[General]], [[Admiral]] or [[Air Chief Marshal|Air Chief Marshal]].

Under the current ADF command structure the day to day management of the ADF is distinct from the command of military operations.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 14.</ref> The services are administered through the Australian Defence Organisation, with the head of each service (the Chiefs of the Navy, Army and Air Force) and the service headquarters being responsible for  raising, training and sustaining combat forces. In addition, each Chief is the Australian Government's principal advisor on matters concerning the responsibilities of their service.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 187.</ref> 

While the members of each service ultimately report to their service Chief, the Chiefs do not command the operations of their service. Control of ADF operations is exercised through a formal command chain headed by the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, who reports to the CDF as the Chief of Joint Operations. As part of this structure each service is organised into an operational command (Maritime Command, Land Command and Air Command) which reports to the VCDF and the Navy and Army have a training command which reports to the head of the respective service (the RAAF's Training Group has formed part of Air Command since 2006). Several 'joint' operational commands also report to the VCDF. In practice, when ADF units deploy on exercises or operational deployments they are temporarily re-assigned from their respective service to the relevant operational headquarters.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 14.</ref>

===Joint combat forces===
[[Image:ADF_Command.JPG|thumb|The current command and control structure for ADF operations]]
Operational command of the ADF was exercised by Headquarters Australian Theatre (HQ AST) initially established in 1995 at [[Potts Point]] in Sydney, led by a two-star equivalent officer. HQ AST was re-designated Joint Operations Command in 2004 which will move to a new facility near [[Bungendore, New South Wales|Bungendore, NSW]] in late 2008. The Vice-Chief of Defence Force now has the additional responsibility of Chief of Joint Operations, directing the JOC. 

The ADF has a number of permanent joint operational commands which are responsible to the Vice-Chief of Defence Force. Joint Logistics Command is responsible for managing the ADF's logistics on a joint basis. This is achieved through regional Joint Logistics units and contracts with private companies.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2004).

Pages 146-148.</ref> In addition, the ADF has two Deployable Joint Force Headquarters; one is based on the headquarters of the Army's [[Australian 1st Division|1st Division]] and the other on the headquarters of the Navy's Commodore Flotillas. These headquarters are designated DJFHQ (Land) and DJFHQ (Maritime) respectively.<ref>Kathryn Spurling (2001). '1991-2001: The Era of Defence Reform' in ''The Royal Australian Navy. A History,'' David Stevens (editor), Oxford University Press, Melbourne. Page 278.</ref>

===Royal Australian Navy===

The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the [[navy|naval branch]] of the Australian Defence Force. The RAN operates around 60 vessels, including [[frigate]]s, [[submarine]]s, [[patrol boat]]s and auxiliary ships. The RAN is one of the most modern navies in the Pacific and is tasked with the responsibility of defending Australian waters and undertaking operations in distant locations.

The RAN is currently structured into an operational command, Maritime Command, and a support command, Navy Systems Command.<ref>Sea Power Centre - Australia (2005). ''[http://www.navy.gov.au/spc/ncamo/default.html The Navy Contribution to Australian Maritime Operations (RAN Doctrine 2 - 2005)].'' Defence Publishing Service, Canberra. Pages 33-36.</ref> The Navy's assets are currently organised into seven Force Element Groups (FEGs) which report to the Maritime Commander. The seven FEGs are: Australian Navy Surface Combatants Force, Amphibious Warfare Forces along with the Afloat Support Force, [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Naval Aviation Force]], [[Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service|Australian Navy Submarine Force]], Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Forces, [[Australian Patrol Boat Group|Australian Navy Patrol Boat Force]] and the Australian Navy Hydrographic Force.<ref>Royal Australian Navy. [http://www.navy.gov.au/fegs/ Force Element Groups]. Accessed 10 December 2006.</ref>

===Australian Army===
{{main|Structure of the Australian Army}}

The Australian Army is Australia's military land force. While the Australian Army is principally a [[light infantry]] force, it is currently being 'hardened and networked' to enable it to conduct higher-intensity operations.<ref>Australian Army [http://www.defence.gov.au/ARMY/HNA/Home.htm The Hardened and Networked Army]. Accessed 17 December 2006.</ref>   

Land Command is the authority responsible for the operations of Australian land forces, and has its headquarters in [[Sydney]]. The Australian Army's combat forces are organised into two high-readiness regular [[brigade]]s, one combined regular-reserve brigade and six [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] brigades. In addition, there is an aviation brigade and a logistics brigade. The Army's main tactical formation is the [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]], formed around the headquarters of either an infantry battalion or armoured regiment. The Australian Army is currently capable of fielding up to six battlegroups (one armoured and five infantry), though it would not be feasible to deploy six battlegroups simultaneously.  

While the Australian Army has two Divisional headquarters, only one (the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]]) is deployable as the Deployable Joint Force Headquarters (Land). The Headquarters of the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]] performs administrative functions only. The Australian Army has not deployed a divisional sized formation since 1945 and does not expect to do so in the future.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 195.</ref>

===Royal Australian Air Force===
{{main|Structure of the RAAF}}
The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is the [[air force]] branch of the Australian Defence Force. The RAAF is equipped with modern [[Military aircraft|combat]] and [[Cargo aircraft|transport aircraft]] and has a network of bases in strategic locations across Australia.

Unlike the other services, the RAAF is organised into a single command, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]], which includes the [[RAAF Training Command|Air Force Training Group]]. Air Command is the operational arm of the RAAF and consists of the [[Air Combat Group RAAF|Air Combat Group]], [[Air Lift Group RAAF|Air Lift Group]], [[Surveillance and Response Group RAAF|Surveillance and Response Group]], [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Combat Support Group]] and [[Aerospace Operational Support Group RAAF|Aerospace Operational Support Group]]. Each group consists of a number of wings. The RAAF has seventeen flying squadrons; four combat squadrons, two maritime patrol squadrons, five transport squadrons, five training squadrons (including three [[Operational Conversion Unit|operational conversion unit]]s) and one [[Airborne Early Warning & Control]] squadron which is currently forming.

==Personnel==

The Australian Defence Force has been an all-volunteer force since [[Conscription in Australia|conscription was abolished in 1972]].<ref>Australian War Memorial. [http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/conscription/ Conscription]. Accessed 16 December 2006.</ref> ADF recruits must be either Australian citizens or a permanent resident eligible for Australian citizenship. The minimum age for ADF recruits is 17 years of age and the retirement age is 55 years for permanent personnel and 60 years for reservists.<ref>Defence Jobs [http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/default.asp?p=33 Frequently Asked Questions]. Accessed 16 December 2006.</ref>

===Personnel in each service===

The Australian Defence Force had an average strength of 51,151 permanent (full-time) and 19,464 reserve (part-time) personnel during the 2005-06 financial year. The Army is the largest service, followed by the RAAF and RAN. In 2005-06 the ADO also employed an average of 13,577 civilian members of the [[Australian Public Service]] and 1,319 contracted non-APS staff.<ref>[http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/05-06/dar/index.htm ''Defence Annual Report 2005-06''].

===Recruitment and retention===
[[Image:ADF strengths 90-06.JPG|thumb|The average permanent strengths of the services between 1990 and 2006.<ref>Compiled from Khosa (2004) pages 40-41 and  [http://www.defence.gov.au/annualreports/ Australian Department of Defence annual reports]</ref>]]
Despite increased government expenditure on recruitment and retention and the goal of increasing the size of the ADF, the number of permanent members of the ADF declined by 891 personnel between 2003-04 and 2005-06.<ref>Mark Thomson (2006). ''[http://www.aspi.org.au/htmlver/25983Your_Defence$06/index.html Your Defence Dollar: The 2006–07 Defence Budget]''. Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Canberra. Page 4.</ref> In the 2005-06 financial year the ADF enlisted 4,145 permanent personnel and 3,297 reservists. These numbers fell short of the ADF's recruitment targets and represent 84% of the permanent force recruitment target and 77% of the reserve force target. They do represent an improvement on the achievements against the targets for the 2004-05 financial year (80% and 70% respectively), however.<ref>[http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/05-06/dar/index.htm ''Defence Annual Report 2005-06'']. Pages 224-225.</ref> During 2005-06 11% of ADF personnel left the military.<ref>[http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/05-06/dar/index.htm ''Defence Annual Report 2005-06'']. Page 229.</ref>

Under current Australian Government policies the ADF is to be expanded to 57,000 full time personnel. This expanded force will require around 6,500 recruits each year. In an attempt to increase recruitment and reduce the ADF's separation rate the Government is introducing initiatives to streamline the recruitment process, relax some minimum standards for recruits and provide retention bonuses for personnel in critical positions and with key skill sets.<ref>Prime Minister of Australia media release, [http://pm.gov.au/news/media_Releases/media_Release2307.html Reforms to Boost ADF Recruitment and Retention], 15 December 2006.</ref>

===Training===

Individual training of Australian servicemen and women is generally provided by the services in their own training institutions. Each service has its own training organisation which manages this individual training. Where possible, however, individual training is increasingly being provided through tri-service schools.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 281.</ref>

Military academies include [[HMAS Creswell]] for the Navy, [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] for the Army, and the Officer Training School - [[RAAF Base Williams]] for the Air Force. The [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] is a Tri-Service university for officer cadets of all services wishing to attain a university degree through the Australian Defence Force. Navy [[Recruit training|recruit training]] is conducted at [[HMAS Cerberus]], Army recruits are trained at the Army Recruit Training Centre at [[Kapooka]] near [[Wagga Wagga]] and Air Force recruits at [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 294-301.</ref>
===Women in the ADF===
[[Image:050615-N-6811L-040-s.jpg|thumb|A member of the Army's 26th Transport Squadron with her truck]]

The number of positions available to women in the ADF has increased over time.<ref>Australian Parliamentary Library [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/fad/women_armed.htm Women in the armed forces: the role of women in the Australian Defence Force]. Accessed 16 December 2006.</ref> In 2006 approximately 97% of employment categories in the ADF were available to females. The only positions which women are currently excluded from are those in which there is a high probability of 'direct combat', which includes all [[infantry]] positions and other positions in which there is a high probability of [[hand to hand combat]].<ref>Defence Jobs [http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/default.asp?p=33&IntCatID=9 Frequently Asked Questions - Gender Restrictions]. Accessed 16 December 2006.</ref> As a result, while almost all positions in the Navy and Air Force are open to women, women are excluded from a high proportion of Army positions.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 52.</ref> 

Despite the expansion in the number of positions available to women, there has been only limited growth in the percentage of female permanent defence personnel. In the 1989-90 financial year women filled 11.4% of permanent ADF positions. In the 2005-06 financial year women occupied 13.3% of permanent positions and 15.6% of reserve positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 40.3%.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 52 and Australian Department of Defence (2006). ''[http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/05-06/dar/downloads/2005-2006_Defence_DAR_07_v1append.pdf 2005-06 Defence Annual Report]''.

===Ranks and insignia===
{{main|Australian Defence Force ranks and insignia}}

The three Australian services inherited their rank structure from their [[British Armed Forces|British counterparts]]. The insignia used to identify these ranks are also generally similar to those used in the British Armed Forces.

==Defence expenditure==

The Australian Defence Organisation was allocated $A22 Billion for the 2006-07 financial year. This level of expenditure is equivalent to approximately 1.9 percent of Australian [[Gross Domestic Product]]<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2006). [http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/06-07/pbs/index.htm ''Portfolio Budget Statements 2006-07.''] Page 19.</ref> and 10 percent of the Australian Government's planned expenditure over the 2006-07 financial year.<ref>Australian Treasury. [http://www.budget.gov.au/2006-07/overview/html/overview_30.htm Australian Government taxation and spending]. Accessed 18 December 2006.</ref> In the 2006-07 budget the Australian Government committed itself to continue to increase real Defence spending by 3 percent each year until 2015-16.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2006). [http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/06-07/pbs/index.htm ''Portfolio Budget Statements 2006-07.''] Page 3.</ref>

In relative terms, Australia's defence expenditure as a proportion of GDP is greater than that of most developed Western nations, but is not as large as that of Australia's larger neighbours. In dollar terms Australia's defence budget is larger than that of its neighbours, however. This reflects the smaller size of these regional economies.<ref>Mark Thomson (2005).

==Equipment==
===Current equipment===
: ''For more details on this topic, see [[Current Royal Australian Navy ships]], [[Weaponry of the Australian Army]] and [[Royal_Australian_Air_Force#Current_strength|Current aircraft of the RAAF]]''
While the ADF seeks to be a high-technology force, much of its equipment is approaching obsolescence and is scheduled to be replaced or upgraded in the near future.<ref>Mark Thomson (2005). ''[http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=78&pubtype=6 Punching above our weight? Australia as a middle power]''. Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Canberra. Pages 9-10.</ref> This equipment is largely adequate for Australia's current needs, however. [[Australia and weapons of mass destruction|Australia does not possess]] [[weapons of mass destruction]] and has ratified the [[Biological Weapons Convention]], [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] and [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].<ref>Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (2005).

Although most of the ADF's weapons are only used by a single service, increased emphasis is being placed on commonality. The three services use the same small arms and the [[Browning Hi-Power|FN Herstal 35]] is the ADF's standard hand gun, the [[F88 Austeyr]] the standard rifle, the [[F89 Minimi]] the standard light support weapon, the [[FN MAG|FN Herstal MAG-58]] the standard light machine gun and the [[M2 Browning machine gun|Browning M2HB]] the standard heavy machine gun.<ref>Khosa (2004).

===Planned procurement===
[[Image:Aust JST USN.jpg|thumb|[[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Australian Minister for Defence]] [[Brendan Nelson|Dr Brendan Nelson]] signing the JSF Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding in December 2006.]]

The [[Defence Materiel Organisation]] has the responsibility for the procurement of Australian Defence Force equipment. The ADF's identified procurement needs over the next ten years are outlined in the ''2006-16 Defence Capability Plan'' (DCP).<ref>Defence Materiel Organisation. [http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/id/dcp/dcp.cfm 2006-16 Defence Capability Plan: Public Version].</ref> The projects in the DCP have a total value of [[Australian dollar|$A]]51 billion.<ref>Defence Capability Plan: Public Version. Page iii.</ref>

The largest projects set out in the DCP are the replacement of the RAAF's combat aircraft (almost certainly with [[F-35 Lightning II]] aircraft), the [[Hobart class destroyer|air warfare destroyer]] project, the replacement of the RAAF's maritime patrol aircraft, the replacement of the RAN's anti-submarine helicopters, the replacement of the ADF's entire fleet of field vehicles and the purchase of two [[Canberra class large amphibious ship|large amphibious ships]]. Other significant purchases set out in the DCP include the purchase of [[NHI NH90|MRH-90]] transport helicopters for the Army and Navy and [[M1A1 Abrams]] tanks.<ref>Defence Capability Plan: Public Version.

==Foreign defence relations==
[[Image:F-111_KC-135.jpg|thumb|An Australian [[F-111]] approaching a [[USAF]] tanker aircraft during a joint exercise in 2006.]]
{{see also|Foreign relations of Australia}}
The Australian Defence Force cooperates with militaries around the world. Australia's formal military agreements include the [[ANZUS|ANZUS Alliance]] with the [[United States of America]], the Closer Defence Program with [[New Zealand]] and the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]] with [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], New Zealand and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 74.</ref> ADF activities under these agreements include participating in joint planning, intelligence sharing, personnel exchanges, equipment standardisation programs and joint exercises.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2002). ''[http://www.defence.gov.au/publications/f2020.pdf Force 2020].'' Australian Department of Defence, Canberra. Page 7.</ref>

The ADF provides assistance to regional militaries through the Defence Cooperation Program. As part of this program Australia provides assistance with training, infrastructure, equipment and logistics support and participates in joint exercises with countries in South East Asia and Oceania. The [[Pacific Patrol Boat Program]] is the largest Defence Cooperation activity and supports 22 patrol boats operated by twelve South Pacific countries.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 85.</ref> A performance audit of the Defence Cooperation Program conducted in 2001 found that while Defence does not adequately monitor the Program's performance, it was "valued highly by participating countries".<ref>[[Australian National Audit Office]] (2001). [http://www.anao.gov.au/search.cfm?cat_id=0&arg=Defence%20Cooperation%20Program|''Defence Cooperation Program''. Audit Report No.32 2000–2001.] ANAO, Canberra. Pages 9-10.</ref>

==Current operations==
As of January 2007, around 2900 Australian Defence Force personnel are deployed on overseas operations. An additional 300 personnel are deployed on domestic maritime security tasks.<ref>Australian Department of Defence. [http://www.defence.gov.au/globalops.cfm Global Operations]. Accessed 1 January 2007.</ref> The ADF also maintains several units which can deploy at very short notice in response to terrorist incidents in Australia or overseas.

===Foreign deployments===

The ADF's contribution to the rehabilitation of [[Iraq]], [[Operation Catalyst]], forms the largest ADF deployment. As of January 2007, 1400 ADF personnel were deployed to the Middle East as part of this operation. ADF units in Iraq include [[Overwatch Battle Group (West)]] located at [[Tallil Airbase]] in [[Dhi Qar Governorate]], a 110-strong security detachment protecting the Australian embassy in [[Baghdad]], a frigate in the [[Persian Gulf]] and detachments of C-130 and AP-3C aircraft.<ref>Australian Department of Defence. [http://www.defence.gov.au/opcatalyst/ Operation Catalyst]. Accessed 1 January 2007.</ref>

As of January 2007 approximately 500 ADF personnel were deployed as part of [[Operation Slipper]], Australia's contribution to the [[War on Terrorism|international coalition against terrorism]]. The majority of these personnel form part of the 1st Reconstruction Task Force located in [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan's]] [[Oruzgan Province]]. The other ADF unit in Afghanistan is a 110-person strong [[CH-47 Chinook]] detachment drawn from the [[Australian 5th Aviation Regiment|5th Aviation Regiment]].<ref>Australian Department of Defence. [http://www.defence.gov.au/opslipper/default.htm Operation Slipper]. Accessed 1 January 2007.</ref>

The ADF currently has units deployed on several operations in Australia's immediate neighbourhood. Approximately 800 personnel, most of whom form part of a battlegroup commanded by the [[6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]], deployed to [[Timor Leste]] on peacekeeping duties as part of [[Operation Astute]]. 140 personnel are in the Solomon Islands as the ADF's contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]]. In addition, the ADF maintains a permanent presence at the [[Royal Malaysian Air Force]] base near [[Butterworth, Malaysia]] and AP-3C Orion aircraft periodically deploy to this base to conduct patrols over the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[South China Sea]] as part of [[Operation Gateway]].

===Domestic operations===
[[Image:NORFORCE (2006 S0270 01).jpg|thumb|Members of [[NORFORCE]] during a surveillance patrol in 2006]]

The ADF's contribution to Australia's domestic maritime security is conducted under [[Operation Resolute]]. As part of Operation Resolute ADF ships, aircraft and [[Regional Force Surveillance Units]] conduct patrols in conjunction with the [[Australian Customs Service]]. This operation is commanded by the [[Joint Offshore Protection Command (Australia)|Joint Offshore Protection Command]] which is jointly manned by members of the ADF and Customs. Approximately 300 personnel were assigned to Operation Resolute in January 2007.

The Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program is a program in which Australian Army engineering units periodically work with remote [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] communities to upgrade the community's infrastructure and provide training. The AACAP was established in November 1996 and an Army engineer squadron assists one community for several months each year.<ref>Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs media release [http://www.atsia.gov.au/media/media06/171106.aspx Army celebrates 10 years of service to Indigenous communities]. 17 November 2006.</ref>
===Counter-terrorism===

Under the Australian National Counter-Terrorism Plan the [[Law enforcement in Australia|State and Territory police]] and emergency services have the primary responsibility for responding to any terrorist incidents on Australian territory. If a terrorist threat or the consequences of an incident are beyond the capacity of civilian authorities to resolve the ADF may be 'called out' to provide support. In order to meet its counter-terrorism responsibilities the ADF maintains two elite [[Tactical Assault Group (Australia)|Tactical Assault Groups]] based in Sydney and Perth, the [[Australian Incident Response Regiment|Incident Response Regiment]] which is trained and equipped to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive incidents and a company-sized high readiness group in each [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] brigade and the [[1st Commando Regiment]].<ref>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (2004).
