'''Kenneth Scott Rogers''' (born [[November 10]], [[1964]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]]) is a [[left-handed]] [[United States|American]] [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]] who has played for six [[Major League Baseball]] teams since his [[rookie]] year in [[1989]].  Previously lauded only for his fielding and [[perfect game]], he is currently the possessor of 23 consecutive [[shutout]] innings in postseason baseball.  His career 207-139 win-loss record gives him a winning percentage of (.598).

His nickname is "'''The Gambler'''" as a play on [[country music]] star [[Kenny Rogers]]'s trademark single ''[[The Gambler (song)|The Gambler]]''. He is also referred to as "The Roaster" by smack radio host [[Jim Rome]] a play on the aforementioned Country Singer Rogers restaurant chain [[Kenny Rogers Roasters]]

==Biography==
Rogers grew up on a 15-acre [[strawberry]] [[farm]] in [[Dover, Florida]].  Upon meeting his future wife as a teenager, he told her that he would become a farmer if his baseball career did not pan out. His goal was to play in the majors for three years.  After pitching [[2006 World Series#Game 2.2C October 22|Game 2 of the 2006 World Series]], he completed his 18th season, the first of a two-year, $16 million contract.

Signed to the [[Texas]] [[farm team]] in the 39th round for $1000 when he was only seventeen years old, he graduated from [[Plant City High School]] in [[Florida]] in 1982, where he played baseball only during his senior season, hitting .375 as a [[right fielder]] (he played [[shortstop]] in his senior league).  He was converted into a pitcher on the strength of his throwing arm and left-handedness.  Rogers spent seven years in the [[minor leagues]] before making it to the Rangers in 1989 as a [[reliever]].  He became a starting pitcher for the club in 1993.

During his career, he has played for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] (1989&ndash;95, 2000&ndash;02, 2004&ndash;05), the [[New York Yankees]] (1996&ndash;97), [[Oakland Athletics]] (1998&ndash;99), the [[New York Mets]] (1999), the [[Minnesota Twins]] (2003), and the [[Detroit Tigers]] (2006-present).

Rogers achieved notoriety among [[Mets]] fans during his tenure with New York. During the 1999 National League Championship Series against the [[Braves]], he entered in relief in the bottom of the 11th of Game 6, with the [[Mets]] down 3 games to 2. After surrendering a double and the baserunner advancing to 3rd on a sacrifice fly and two subsequent intentional walks issued to [[Chipper Jones]] and [[Brian Jordan]], Rogers ended New York's magical season by walking [[Andruw Jones]] on five pitches with the bases loaded.

He, his wife Rebecca Lewis, daughter Jessica Lynn, and son Trevor reside in [[Westlake, Texas]] during the off-season.Both kids go to westlake academy the local school. Jessica Lynn is in 7th grade and Trevor is in 4th He enjoys golf, fishing, and building houses for [[Habitat for Humanity]].

===All-Star Game Appearances===
He is the only [[left-handed]] pitcher selected for each of the last two [[All-Star Game]]s before this year.  It was announced on [[2 July]] [[2006]] that he had been selected for the 2006 AL squad, and was American League manager [[Ozzie Guillen]]'s pick for starting pitcher. In his first All-Star Game start, he pitched two innings and gave up three hits and one run -- a solo home run to [[David Wright (baseball player)|David Wright]].

===2006 Pennant Race===
On [[October 6]], [[2006]], Rogers pitched his way to his first postseason win pitching 7 <small><sup>2</sup></small>/<small><sub>3</sub></small> scoreless innings, with 8 [[strikeouts]] in a 6-0 Tigers victory against the [[New York Yankees]] in [http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=261006106 Game 3] of the [[American League Division Series]].  At 41 years and 330 days old, he became the oldest starting pitcher to earn his first career postseason win. 

A week later on [[October 13]], Rogers retired nine batters in a row, in [http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=261013106 Game 3] of the [[American League Championship Series]] against the [[Oakland Athletics]], allowing only two hits and two walks in 7 <small><sup>1</sup></small>/<small><sub>3</sub></small> scoreless innings, while striking out six and pacing the Tigers to a 3-0 victory, leaving the Tigers one win away from their first [[World Series]] since [[1984]].

===2006 World Series===
Rogers started [http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=261022106 Game 2] of the [[2006 World Series]] on [[October 22]], [[2006]]. "We wanted Kenny to pitch two games at home," Leyland said.[http://www.mankatofreepress.com/sports/feeds/apcontent/apstories/apstorysection/D8KSKH500.xml.txt/resources_apstoryview] He left the game with the Tigers in the lead 3-0, pitching 8 shutout innings, retiring 10 straight batters, striking out five, allowing only two hits, with three walks.

Rogers said it was dirt mixed with [[rosin]] from the rosin bag, wiped it off and pitched 8 scoreless innings for the win. Major League Baseball spokesperson Rich Levin said the incident was investigated, and the substance was described as dirt. Since it was not ruled to be a foreign substance, per Rule 8.02, Rogers remained in the game. [http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20061022&amp;content_id=1720779&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb] In the process, Rogers extended his streak to 23 shutout innings. Examination of images from previous games has revealed similar smudges in two other games. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0610/gallery.mlb.rogers/content.8.html] The national media’s coverage of the incident was dubbed “Smudge-gate”. 

==In the news==
Rogers had refused to talk to local media during the [[2005 in baseball|2005 season]] after they published a report saying Rogers was having trouble trying to get the Rangers to give him a contract extension, and that he would retire if he didn't get one. 

On [[June 29]], [[2005]], after walking out onto [[Ameriquest Field]] for a pre-game warmup against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], Rogers [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2097491 shoved two cameramen], knocking a camera to the ground. One of the reporters then resumed filming and Rogers shoved him again, this time kicking the camera after it had been knocked to the ground a second time. He had to be restrained and was sent home. Larry Rodriguez of [[Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex]]' [[Fox Network]] affiliate [[KDFW]] was taken to a local hospital, complaining of shoulder, arm and leg pain. While in the hospital, Rodriguez made an official complaint of assault against Rogers. 

On [[July 1]], [[2005]], Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] suspended Rogers for 20 games and fined him $50,000. While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the 2005 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]].

On [[July 18]], [[2005]], Rogers was charged with a Class A [[misdemeanor]] assault charge with regard to Rodriguez and a Class C [[misdemeanor]] assault charge with regard to [[FSN (Fox Sports Net)|FSN Southwest]] cameraman David Mammeli.  Rogers was cited and released on $1,500 [[Bail bond|bond]].

On [[July 22]], [[2005]], Selig heard Rogers' appeal of his suspension; on [[July 27]], Selig upheld the suspension. However, on [[August 9]], [[2005]], independent [[arbitration|arbitor]] Shyam Das ruled that Selig's actions exceeded his authority and Rogers was reinstated effective the next day. Das also ruled the $50,000 fine be converted to a charitable contribution. In all, Rogers' suspension lasted 13 games. 

On [[August 11]], [[2005]], Rogers returned to the mound against the [[Boston Red Sox]] in [[Fenway Park]]. Rogers allowed five runs and seven hits in five innings, on the way to a 16-5 Boston victory. He finished 2005 with a 3.46 ERA in 195 <small><sup>1</sup></small>/<small><sub>3</small></sub> innings. Shortly after the regular season ended, the Rangers announced Rogers would not return to the team.

On [[October 5]], [[2005]], Rodriguez filed a [[civil suit]] against Rogers and the Rangers, seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages.

On [[March 26]], [[2006]], Rogers reached an agreement with the prosecution; that if he completed an [[anger management]] course within four months, the Class A [[misdemeanor]] would be reduced to a Class C misdemeanor.

==Signing with Detroit==
On [[December 8]], [[2005]], Rogers signed a two-year, $16 million contract with the [[Detroit Tigers]]. As of [[2006]], Rogers ended his regular season at 17-8 with a 3.84 ERA. "We've needed a guy like that for a long time. I'm glad we went out and got him. ... He means a lot to our team and to guys like me," said Tigers starter [[Jeremy Bonderman]], on Kenny Rogers.

Rogers, on his first year in [[Detroit]]: "There's a lot of benefits here, by far, that you wouldn't know as a visiting player, and for me, I've been around quite a while, but I appreciate the town, the city, the people.  The travel for a baseball player is very hard, but here it's not that difficult. It lends itself to being able to relax on certain days that you could get off. There's just more benefits, especially when you have the quality of people here like [[Dave Dombrowski|Dombrowski]] and like we have in [[Mike Ilitch|Mr. Ilitch]], those things that you can't take for granted.  You add in [[Jim Leyland]] and the coaching staff here, and I just got lucky to choose this place. ... Right when I went in the door and met them, I knew. I knew where I was going to end up." [http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/7EDCEA272D32871F8625720D00781877?OpenDocument]

On [[March 30]], [[2007]], [[ESPN]] is reporting that Kenny Rogers will miss three months after undergoing surgery for a blood clot in his pitching shoulder.
