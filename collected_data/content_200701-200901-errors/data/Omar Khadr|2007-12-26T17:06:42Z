'''Omar Ahmed Khadr''' born [[September 19]], [[1986]] in [[Toronto]], is a [[Canada|Canadian]] who is accused by U.S. forces of being a terrorist. He was captured while fighting against American forces in [[Afghanistan]] when he was 15 years of age.<ref name=DoDList2>[http://www.dod.mil/news/May2006/d20060515%20List.pdf list of prisoners (.pdf)], ''[[US Department of Defense]]'', [[May 15]] [[2006]]</ref> 
His case has drawn considerable attention as a [[child soldier]], and he is among the youngest prisoners held in [[extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial detention]] in the [[Guantánamo Bay detainment camp]]s, in [[Cuba]], and the only [[Canada|Canadian]].

On [[2007-06-04]], a military court dismissed all charges against Khadr because of a procedural flaw - the court was authorized to try [[unlawful enemy combatant]]s, but an earlier review had labelled Khadr as merely an "[[enemy combatant]]"<ref name=MiamiHerald20070604>

== Life in Canada ==
Omar Khadr, like most of the children in the [[Khadr family]], was born in [[Canada]], and both parents were Canadian citizens.  Through [[1985]] to [[1997]] mostly the family was living in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]], where the father [[Ahmed Said Khadr]] was working, they visited Canada on a 1-2 year basis.<ref name=GoodSon>[http://www.hvk.org/articles/1202/293.html The Good Son], originally published in the ''[[National Post]]'', [[December 28]], [[2002]]</ref> 

In 1992 Ahmed Said Khadr was wounded by a land-mine, and spent a year back in Canada recovering his health.

== Life in bin Laden's compound ==
Khadr's father moved his family to Afghanistan in [[1997]], where they lived in their office compound. They later moved to bin Laden's compound but only after it had been evacuated. During their stay in their office the family visited the bin Laden compound occasionaly and the children played with his children amongst others.<ref name=SonofAlQaeda>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/khadr/ Son of al Qaeda], ''[[Frontline (PBS)]]''</ref>  Khadr's father has been described as one of bin Laden's senior lieutenants.

Omar's older brother [[Abdurahman Khadr]] described being sent to military training camps shortly after his arrival, when he was just eleven years old.  All of the Khadr boys are believed to have military training while they were  children.

== Capture ==
On [[2002-07-22]], 15-year-old Khadr was in a compound near [[Khost]] that was surrounded by US special forces.  According to Master Sgt Scotty Hansen of Utah, "we [sent] a couple of Afghan interpreters to go in and talk to them because we didn't want to be storm troopers unless we had to."  The two interpreters were shot "point blank in the face," however, according to Sergeant [[Layne Morris]], after which "all heck broke out," according to Hansen<ref>http://www.thestar.com/News/article/208502</ref>.  Sergeant [[Layne Morris]] was injured early in the skirmish.  The Americans called in a devasting air strike, such that no survivors were expected.  Khadr, however, survived and allegedly threw a grenade, which injured Sgt. [[Christopher Speer]] and led to his death, and injured three other members of the squad.<ref name=GoodSon>[http://www.hvk.org/articles/1202/293.html The Good Son], originally published in the ''[[National Post]]'', [[December 28]], [[2002]]</ref> 
Omar was shot three times, and left nearly blind in one eye. He received medical treatment for the gunshot wounds upon being captured.

== Accusations against Khadr ==

In addition to being charged with the murder of Sgt. Christopher Speer, Khadr is also being accused of attempted murder, conspiracy, spying and "providing material support for terrorism".<ref name=Macleans20070425>

On [[2007-11-18]], ''60 Minutes'' aired a video of Khadr assembling bombs while wearing civilian clothes.<ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/16/60minutes/main3516048.shtml</ref>

== Incarceration at Guantánamo Bay ==
There were other child detainees incarcerated at Guantánamo Bay.  Three of them were kept in a smaller compound, [[Camp Iguana]], where they were allegedly treated humanely.  They were not required to wear the orange coveralls.  They were provided with school teachers, and recreation.  The BBC interviewed one 13-year-old child detainee upon his return to Afghanistan.  He had learned to read at Camp Iguana.  The two years he spent there were the only education he had ever had, and he reported being sorry to leave.  

[[Elaine Chao]] the [[United States Secretary of Labor]] has spoken about the responsibility to give child soldiers special treatment, to provide help for them to re-integrate into society.<ref name=ChildSoldiers>[[Elaine L. Chao]], [http://www.dol.gov/_sec/media/speeches/20030507_ILAB_ChildSoldiers.htm Children in the Crossfire: Prevention and Rehabilitation of Child Soldiers], ''[[US Department of Labor]]'', [[May 7]] [[2003]]</ref>  She announced a $3 million program to help re-integrate child-soldiers in Afghanistan back into Afghan society.

However, Khadr was treated as an adult.  Khadr has been reported to have been kept in solitary confinement, for long periods of time; to have been denied adequate medical treatment; to have been subjected to ''"[[short shackling]]"'' , and left bound, in uncomfortable ''"[[stress position]]s"'' until he soiled himself.<ref name=AmnestyInternationalCase8>

[[Bryan Del Monte]], the [[United States Department of Defense]] deputy director for political development and international issues in the Office of Detainee Affairs, gave a [[press conference]] following his return from testifying before the [[United Nations Committee against torture]]. <ref name=AsharqAlawsat060513> [http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&id=4927 US DoD Official Discusses Guantanamo], ''[[Asharq Alawsat]]'', [[May 13]] [[2006]]</ref>
During this press conference he asserted that Khadr, and two other youths, were incarcerated separately from adults, and were provided with daily lessons:
<blockquote>Del Monte said that those in charge of the Guantanamo detention camp provide the three youngsters with lessons every morning in Mathematics, English, Sciences, and other subjects for their mental and psychological needs in addition to teaching physical fitness and sports.</blockquote>

Del Monte's assertion stands in contrast to the other accounts of Khadr's incarceration, where he has been described as leading the prayer sessions of the other detainees in his cell block.

=== Khadr's Combatant Status Review ===
Khadr's case was reviewed by the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] on [[2004-09-08]].  The review released a one page summary of their conclusions on [[2004-09-17]].  Khadr's lawyers had written him a letter, recommending that he refrain from cooperating with the tribunal, or any questioning conducted without adequate legal representation.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The tribunal concluded that Khadr was an "[[enemy combatant]]".

At the time of his hearing Khadr had not been allowed to meet with any lawyer and no consideration was given to the fact he was a child soldier at the time of the attack.

=== Access to lawyers and family ===
[[Image:Edney and Kuebler.jpg|thumb|250px|Defence attorney [[Dennis Edney]] (L) and Lt. Cmdr. [[William C. Kuebler|Bill Kuebler]] (R)]]
Omar Khadr's brother [[Abdurahman Khadr]] claimed in the documentary [[Son of al Qaeda]] that he talked with Omar over a fence in 2003. At the time, Abdurahman was a prisoner at Guantanamo as well, though he later claimed that he was there on a mission for the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Omar reportedly told Abdurahman to stick to a previously agreed-upon story that the family had no connections to Al Qaeda, and that his health was fine.

A June 15, 2005 article in ''[[Newsday]]'' cited [[Muneer Ahmad]]'s experience as an example of the difficulties the Pentagon presented to detainees' lawyers.<ref name=Newsday050615>[http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-woguan0615,0,2202228,print.story?coll=ny-world-big-pix At Gitmo, still no day in court: How feds avoid hearings for terror suspects — despite Supreme Court ruling], ''[[Newsday]]'', [[June 15]], [[2005]]</ref>
Ahmad also reported that Khadr had described extensive abusive treatment to him, but that when he arrived at the Virginia security centre, all twenty pages of his notes had been [[redacted]].  

Mr Ahmad's first meeting with Khadr was not until November 2004.  Khadr has still not been permitted to speak with the Canadian lawyers who were his family's first choice.  [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/08/khadrspeaks.html CBCNews] reported that Khadr was finally permitted to speak with his mother by phone in March, 2007, after approximately five years of detainment.

=== Hunger strikes ===
On [[September 1]] [[2005]], the ''[[Globe and Mail]]'' reported that [[Dennis Edney]], one of Khadr's Canadian lawyers reported that Khadr was participating in a second [[hunger strike]].<ref name=GlobeandMail050901>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v4/sub/MarketingPage?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050901%2FKHADR01%2FTPInternational%2FTopStories&ord=15050617&brand=theglobeandmail&redirect_reason=2&denial_reasons=none&force_login=false Canadian teen in Guantanamo on hunger strike, lawyers say], ''[[Globe and Mail]]'' [[September 1]] [[2005]]</ref>  Khadr participated in the 200-member hunger strike that occurred in late June and July.  The Globe article reports that lawyers said Khadr's first hunger strike lasted 15 days, and that prison authorities administered intravenous fluid.  Khadr reported collapsing as he left the hospital, and that his guards administered a brutal beating.<ref name=GlobeAndMail20050109>

On [[September 11]] [[2005]], ''[[The Independent]]'' published an extract from Guantánamo detainee [[Omar Deghayes]].  On [[July 20]] [[2005]], he wrote about Khadr:<ref name=Independent050911>[http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article311813.ece  Revealed: the diary of a British man on hunger strike in Guantanamo], ''[[The Independent]]'', [[September 11]] [[2005]]</ref>

<blockquote>Omar Khadr [the Canadian juvenile] is very sick in our block. He is throwing [up] blood. They gave him cyrum [serum] when they found him on the floor in his cell. Galib Fiyhani also.</blockquote>

== Khadr Military Commission ==

On [[November 7]], [[2005]], Khadr and nine other Guantanamo inmates were charged to be tried by "[[Guantanamo military commission|Military Commission]]", but the commission was struck down as unlawful by the US Supreme Court in 2006.  After the MCA was signed in October 2006, new charges were sworn against Khadr on February 2, 2007.  Khadr also petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the legality of the military commission and his detention, but this request was [http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/04/30/khadr-court.html denied] April, 2007.

== First round of charges on November 7, 2005 ==

Khadr was charged with [[murder]] for his actions against the squad inside the compound near [[Khost|Khost, Afghanistan]].
The charges against Mr. Khadr allege that his father, the late [[Ahmed Said Khadr]], a Canadian Islamic extremist, was a close friend of [[Osama bin Laden]] and his Egyptian deputy [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], and that Omar Khadr also was acquainted with Mr. bin Laden, the [[Al Qaeda]] leader.<ref name=NYTimes051108>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60F16FF3E5A0C7B8CDDA80994DD404482 Pentagon Charges 5 More In Guantánamo Bay Camp], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[November 8]] [[2005]]</ref>

On [[2006-04-07]], Khadr's lawyers reversed course stating on the record in front of the commission that after consulting with U.S. military officials that Khadr's current conditions of confinement were indeed humane and not done in order to "punish" Khadr for being cooperative in participating in commission proceedings. {{Fact|date=December 2007}}

===Independent medical examination===

Khadr lawyers have been trying, with no success so far, to arrange for Khadr to get an independent medical examination.<ref name=MiamiHerald060626> [http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/14902061.htm Teen's defense looks to doctor for help], ''[[Miami Herald]]'', [[June 26]] [[2006]]</ref><ref name=MedRequest> [http://www.miami.com/multimedia/miami/news/gitmo-khadr.pdf Second Request for Appointment of Expert Consultant: Dr. Xenakis and Dr. Cantor (.pdf)], '[[Miami Herald]]'', [[June 13]] [[2006]]</ref>
They assert that a psychological evaluation is routine for any suspect charged with a murder committed when they were a minor.  They state that an independent examination is essential for them to be able to effectively craft their defense.  Further they assert that the suicides on [[June 10]] [[2006]] put Khadr at greater risk.

Khadr's lawyers had administered a psychological questionnaire to Khadr during one of their earlier visits.<ref name=MedRequest> [http://www.miami.com/multimedia/miami/news/gitmo-khadr.pdf Second Request for Appointment of Expert Consultant: Dr. Xenakis and Dr. Cantor (.pdf)], '[[Miami Herald]]'', [[June 13]] [[2006]]</ref>  An analysis of Khadr's answers indicated that he was at moderate to high risk of committing suicide.

===Charges dismissed===
On [[2007-06-04]], the second round of charges were dismissed by Army Judge Col. Peter Brownback because Khadr was not classified as an "alien [[unlawful enemy combatant]]."<ref name=MiamiHerald20070604>

Khadr was previously classified as an "[[enemy combatant]]" by his [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]], in late 2004. The [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] says that military commissions do not have jurisdiction over those classified as "lawful combatants". Despite the dismissal of charges, Khadr will remain in detention.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sheldon  |last=Alberts |title=Khadr remains in detention after all charges dropped |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=ead5bb60-723b-4f87-a2fe-2dbe0845d8f2 |format= |work=[[National Post]] |publisher=[[CanWest Global Communications|Canwest MediaWorks Publications Inc.]] |id= |pages= |page= |date=2007-06-04 |accessdate=2007-06-04 |language= |quote= }}</ref>

===The Court of Military Commission Review's ruling===

On [[September 25]], [[2007]], [[Thomas W. Hartmann]], the Legal Adviser to the Convening Authority in the Department of Defense Office of Military Commissions, announced that the [[Court of Military Commission Review]] had reached a decision about the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[United States President|Presidency]]'s appeal of Brownback's ruling.<ref name=ArmedForcesPressService47569>

Brownback and Allred's ruling took the Department of Defense by surprise. The [[United States Congress]], when it passed the Military Commissions Act, had mandated that the DoD set up a court where appeals to the Commissions' ruling could take place. But the Court had not been appointed, and the rules under which the court should function had not been fleshed out.

Hartmann anncounced that the Court of Review confirmed that the distinction between an "enemy combatant" and an "unlawful enemy combatant" was a significant distinction.<ref name=ArmedForcesPressService47569/><ref name=Bbc20070925/><ref name=TheJurist20070925/> However, the Court of Review also ruled that the Military Commissions themselves had the authority to make the determination that a captive was an "unlawful enemy combatant". Consequently, Khadr continues to face the second set of charges laid against him on [[February 2]] [[2007]].<ref name=WaPo20070925/>

===[[November 8]] [[2007]] hearing===

Colonel Brownback convened on [[November 8]] [[2007]].  Observers expected him to accept the authority granted to him by the Court of Review to make a ruling as to whether Khadr  was or was not an unlawful combatant.

Lieutenant Commander Kuebler challenged Brownback over whether he was qualified to preside over the commission.
Brownback ruled that since none of the attorneys had challenged his jurisdiction the question of jurisdiction was moot.

Brownback did not make a ruling as to whether Khadr was or was not an unlawful combatant because the Defense had recently learned the Prosecution had exculpatory evidence that they had not chosen to share with the defense.<ref name=ChristianScienceMonitor20071109>

==Official Canadian reaction==

"It is an unfortunate reality that juveniles are too often the victims in military actions and that many groups and countries actively recruit and use them in armed conflicts and in terrorist activities. Canada is working hard to eliminate these practices, but child soldiers still exist, in Afghanistan, and in other parts of the world."
}}

The article notes that Graham's office subsequently tried to claw back the concerns over Khadr's youth.<ref name=TorStar247900/>

In early 2003 [[Jim Gould]], an official with Foreign Affairs' intelligence division, and an official from the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]], were allowed to meet with Khadr.<ref name=TorStar247900/>  The USA was not allowing consular access to the captives, but Gould's observations were to be used by Foreign Affairs to report that: ''"Officials met Mr. Khadr and he seems well." 

The ''Toronto Star'''s report states that when they achieved access to Gould's report it stated<ref name=TorStar247900/>:
{{quotation|"In a fit of anger, he tore off his shirt revealing extensive scarring on the upper torso and a cluster of smaller ones on the upper left side of his body and on the back of his left shoulder."}}

The [[open letter]] AI released was signed by two former foreign affairs ministers and several sitting members of parliament.
The letter acknowledges that the Khadr family has an unsympathetic reception in Canada: {{quotation|"We are aware that, setting aside any of Khadr's own actions, the notoriety of his family makes him unsympathetic in the eyes of some. But it is plainly unjust to punish the son for the sins of the fathers, or to deny a citizen the protection of his government because of the words or deeds of family members."}}

==Further allegations==

On [[July 12]] [[2007]] Prosecutor [[Major]] [[Jeffrey Groharing]] leveled new allegations against Khadr.<ref name=GlobeAndMail20070712>
{{cite news

| author=[[Colin Freeze]]
| publisher=[[Globe and Mail]]
| date=Thursday [[July 12]], [[2007]]
| accessdate=2007-7-12
}}</ref>
Groharing accused Khadr of confessing to wishing to kill Americans to earn a $1,500 bounty.

The ''[[Globe and Mail]]'' quoted from the 24 pages of new charges Groharing released<ref name=GlobeAndMail20070712/>: 
{{quotation|
*“...related that he had been told about a $1,500 reward being placed on the head of each American killed. It was not made clear who offered the bounty. When asked how he felt about the reward system he replied, ‘I wanted to kill a lot of American[s] to get lots of money,'”
*“After vowing to die fighting, the accused armed himself with an AK-47 assault rifle, put on an ammunition vest, and took a position by a window in the compound,” reads the appeal brief. “Toward the end of the firefight, the accused threw a grenade that killed Sergeant First Class Christopher Speer, U.S. Army.”
*“When asked on 17 September, 2002, why he helped the men construct the explosives, the accused responded ‘to kill U.S. forces.' The accused then related during the same interview that he had been told the U.S. wanted to go to war against Islam.”}}

Khadr's lawyers noted the allegations had never been leveled in any of the previous documents or proceedings during Khadr's five years in custody.<ref name=GlobeAndMail20070712/>

[[Nathan Whiting]], one of Khadr's Canadian lawyers, response to the American claims that Khadr was motivated by a bounty was<ref name=GlobeAndMail20070712/>:
{{quotation|
“It is hardly convincing for the U.S. to suggest that in the midst of this battle, and after the entire site had been flattened by 500-pound bombs and everyone else in the compound killed, Omar was lying under the rubble thinking about how to earn himself $1,500.”}}

Khadr didn't arrive at Guantanamo until October 2002.  This interrogation where Groharing claims Khadr confessed would have occurred in Afghanistan, while Khadr was still recovering from his wounds.  Khadr's lawyers have previously claimed that Khadr's interrogators in Afghanistan denied him pain medication to soften him up for interrogation.

== The Speer/Morris lawsuit ==

[[Tabitha Speer]], Sergeant Speer's widow, and Sergeant [[Layne Morris]], launched a civil suit against the estate of [[Ahmed Said Khadr]], Omar Khadr's father.<ref name=SLTribune> [http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3522572 GI injured in Afghan war wins lawsuit: Unique case: Court awards default judgment to man blinded in one eye], ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', [[February 16]] [[2006]]</ref>
They argue that as Khadr was a child, his parents were responsible for his actions, and that since his parents should have kept him from picking up a gun on the battlefield, they were responsible for any wounds he inflicted.  Normally, under US law, one can't sue for damages that were caused by "acts of war".  Speer and Morris argue that Khadr was engaged in an act of terrorism, not an act of war.

They have described the law-suit as "an attempt to attack terrorism in its bank account".

An article published in the [[June 14]] [[2007]] ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' said that Morris and Speer's widow might collect funds via the [[U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]].<ref name=SaltLakeTribune20070514>

[[Sergeant]] [[Heather Cerveny]], the [[paralegal]] for [[Colby Vokey]], Khadr's military lawyer, issued an affidavit reporting that off-duty Guantanamo guards had bragged to her of abusing detainees.
