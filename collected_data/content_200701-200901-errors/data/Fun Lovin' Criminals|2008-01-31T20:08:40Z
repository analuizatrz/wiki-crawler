The '''Fun Lovin' Criminals''' are an [[alternative rap]] / [[alternative rock]] group from [[New York City]], [[United States]]. Their music is a blend of many styles, most notably [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rock and roll|rock]], [[blues]], and [[jazz]], and their songs often deal with everyday life in [[New York City]] and most big cities: [[organized crime]], [[recreational drug use|drugs]], [[violence]], [[poverty]], and [[politics]].  Their songs are often gritty and [[existentialist]] in nature, but are occasionally humorous.  They are best known for their hit "Scooby Snacks", which featured samples from films by [[Quentin Tarantino]].

In their native US, they have somewhat of a cult following.  However, the band gained a considerably large following internationally, notably in northwest [[Europe]], especially around the release of their first two albums in the late nineties.

== Line-up ==
The band was formed in [[1993]] by [[Hugh Morgan (musician)|Hugh "Huey" Morgan"]] (vocals, guitar), [[Brian Leiser |Brian "Fast" Leiser]] (keyboards, bass, trumpet, harmonica) and [[Steve "O" Borovini]] (drums).

In [[1999]], Borovini left the band (after he, in the words of Huey: "went a little crazy and departed to [[Peru]]") - finding later success with [http://www.needledropnyc.com/ Needledrop] and [http://www.difontaine.net/ccjones/ CC JONES]. He was replaced by [[Maxwell "Mackie" Jayson]]  formerly of notable New York Hardcore bands Madball and the Cro-Mags. Mackie was then later replaced in [[2003]] by Mark Reid ([[aka (initialism)|aka]] "Frank" or "The Rhythm Master") from [[Leicester]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], who had previously worked with the band as Mackie's technician. It was widely rumoured in early [[2007]] that the band were going to offer ex-[[The Stone Roses|Stone Roses]] drummer [[Alan Wren|Alan "Reni" Wren]] a position in the band.

== Albums and other projects ==
''Come Find Yourself'', the band's first album, was released in [[1995]] and included the hit "Scooby Snacks", which uses samples from films by [[Quentin Tarantino]], such as a line from Yolanda (a woman who aids in the hold-up of a restaurant at the beginning of [[Pulp_Fiction_%28film%29|Pulp Fiction]]) and, later in the song, a line from Mr Blonde (when he has tied up a captured policeman in [[Reservoir Dogs]]).
Scooby Snacks is about robbing a bank while taking [[Scooby Snacks]]. A lot of the tracks are centered around living in [[New York City]] such as 'Bombin The L' which refers to the 'L' which is the [[L (New York City Subway service)]]. 'Coney Island Girl' is also [[New York City]] themed being about the [[Coney Island]] area of the City. There are also a lot of other references to [[New York City]] across the album. 


This album eventually made it in to the Top 10 of the UK Album Chart after some months of climbing up slowly through the Top 30 long after its release. This coincided with the 2nd release of the single 'Scooby Snacks', their most well known track from the late 90's.  The single was first released before they became well known in the UK. 

''100% Colombian'', released in [[1998]], showed slightly less rock influence. Singles included "Love Unlimited" (a tribute to [[Barry White]]) and "Big Night Out". A [[blues]] song on the album, title "Minibar Blues," featured blues legend [[BB King]].

The [[1999]] album ''Mimosa'' mostly consisted of covers and different versions of earlier released tracks, but the [[2001]] ''Loco'' had all new songs, including the hit single "Loco" (number 5 in the UK), and a more relaxed sound. Loco was used in the [[Miller Beer]] advert at the time. 

Their next album ''Welcome to Poppy's'', released in 2003, had a more upbeat, rock-influenced sound.  They are currently working on a sequel to ''Maui Homicide 2000'', a short film intended for the 2000 Maui Film Festival but banned for its gritty and shocking content.

The album ''[[Livin' In The City]]'' was released in [[2005]] and contained the single "Mi Corazon".

Huey wrote a regular wine column for the British magazine ''[[Mondo]]'' from [[1999]] to [[2000]].  Huey now lives much of the time in England and has developed a taste for the traditional northern dish of pies and peas &ndash; so much so that he has a tattoo of said dish on his left shoulder.  He is in discussion with a Hollywood producer to take the children's BBC programme [[Jossy's Giants]] to the big screen with Jude Law as Geordie football coach Jossy.

Huey appeared as guest presenter on UK comedy music panel show [[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]] on 17th April 2006.

The Fun Lovin' Criminals were the headline act at the [http://www.derby.ac.uk University of Derby] May Ball on 12th May, 2006, and at the [[University of Hull]] End of Year Ball the following day.

The group went on tour in October 2006 playing a few DJ sets across the UK and Europe.

Both Huey and drummer Frank appear in Brit Flick [http://imdb.com/title/tt0822795/ Clubbing to Death] due for release in 2007.

Huey Morgan appeared in the 2003 Irish-made film [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339111/ Headrush] as 'The Yank', which features music from the Fun Lovin' Criminals and Adam Lynch.
