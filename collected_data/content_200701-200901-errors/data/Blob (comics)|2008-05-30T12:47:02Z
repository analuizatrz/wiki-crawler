The '''Blob''' ('''Frederick J. Dukes''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #3 ([[1964#January|January 1964]]).

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], the Blob claims to be unmovable. He possesses an extreme amount of pliable body mass, which grants him superhuman strength and his own [[gravitation|gravitational pull]]. Possessing the mindset of a bully, he mostly uses his powers for petty crime and as a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].

He is one of the most prominent, long-running mutants to be de-powered as a result of the ''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]'' storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early years===
Born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], Fred J. Dukes starts out as a member of a [[circus]] [[sideshow]] under the name "the Blob". He is contacted by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], who tells him that he (Dukes) is a mutant, and asks him to join the X-Men. At the mansion, the other X-Men dislike Dukes for his obnoxious attitude. The Blob refuses Xavier's invitation, saying he is better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tries erasing his mind of what has transpired, the Blob escapes. He gathers up the other Circus members and they attack the mansion. Xavier is able to wipe everyone's minds, and the Blob goes back to the circus.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' Vol. 1 #3)</ref>

===Joining the Brotherhood===
The mutant [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] soon seeks out the Blob to recruit him into his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], restoring his memory through a jarring blow to the head. The Blob temporarily accepts the invitation, but leaves when it is revealed that Magneto has no real concern for the Blob's safety.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #7</ref> He teams up with [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]], who soon becomes his confidant.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #20</ref> The Blob also serves as a member of [[Factor Three]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #37-39</ref> He briefly works as an operative for the [[Secret Empire]], where he fights the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #12-13</ref> With the reorganized Brotherhood, the Blob fights [[Professor X]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  He is caused to revert to infancy by [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]].<ref>''Defenders'' #15-16</ref> The Blob is later returned to adulthood, and fights the [[Champions (comics)|Champions of Los Angeles]].<ref>''Champions'' #17</ref>

He later winds up in prison, but is freed by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] in order to recruit him into her incarnation of the Brotherhood.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #140</ref>  He becomes part of the plot to assassinate [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], the event which leads to the apocalyptic alternate future of ''[[Days of Future Past]]''.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142</ref> He also battles the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as a member of the Brotherhood.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10</ref> With Unus, he battles the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #7</ref> With the Brotherhood, he battles the X-Men once more.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177-178</ref> He witnesses the apparent death of Unus, then goes berserk and attacks [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #91</ref>

He remains with the Brotherhood, becoming a special operative of the federal government when the Brotherhood is reformed as the government-sponsored [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. On the team's first mission, they help capture Magneto.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #199</ref> They then battle the X-Men in San Francisco.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #206</ref> Blob also participates in Freedom Force's capture of the Avengers for the federal government.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #15</ref> With Freedom Force, he attempts to capture [[Rusty Collins]], then battles [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #8-10</ref> With Freedom Force, he battles the X-Men in San Francisco,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223</ref> and later assists in the attempt to arrest the X-Men in Dallas,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225</ref> battling the [[New Mutants]] in Dallas as well.<ref>''New Mutants'' #64</ref> He battles X-Factor again,<ref>''X-Factor'' #30-31</ref> and with [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] and [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] he battles [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] in an attempt to capture a young mutant.<ref>''Daredevil'' #269</ref> He again attempts to arrest Rusty Collins, fighting the New Mutants again.<ref>''New Mutants'' #78-80</ref> He joins [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and Pyro in attacking Avengers headquarters.<ref>''Avengers'' #312</ref> With Freedom Force, he finally captures Rusty Collins and fellow New Mutant [[Skids (comics)|Skids]]. He helps to capture [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but is defeated by Cable and is defeated by [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] during an attempt to recapture Cable.<ref>''New Mutants'' #86-89</ref> With Freedom Force, he assists in thwarting a jailbreak from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Vault Graphic Novel''</ref>

After Freedom Force's dissolution, the Blob participates in other versions of the Brotherhood, including one led by [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] and another led by Professor X; the Blob takes over as leader of the latter when Xavier leaves. 

The psychic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] later recruits Blob, vastly upgrading his powers and abilities ( in his powered-up state, his mutation becomes virtually identical to those of [[Phat]] ). During this time the Blob fights the various members of [[X-Force]] and is soundly defeated in each encounter. Months later, a powered-down Dukes joins the new Brotherhood led once again by Mystique, alongside Toad, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and the [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|daughter]] of the original [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].

When [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] recreates the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob offers to join but is quickly dismissed by Exodus, who considers him useless. This is a major blow to Dukes's already weak self-esteem, for which he seeks the counsel of therapist [[Sean Garrison (comics)|Sean Garrison]]. After a session, Blob attacks the Xavier Institute, though he is defeated by the combined efforts of the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]]. He is then arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

===Post M-Day===
Due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s depowering of 90% of Earth's mutants, the Blob is one of the [[Decimation (comics)|thousands to lose their power]], though his epidermis does not shrink to compensate for his loss of mass, leaving him with huge folds of loose skin. The depressed Blob attempts to commit [[suicide]], but his skin folds prevent him from cutting through to any major blood vessels on his throat or wrists.

Someone that resembles the Blob is seen apprehended by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and is seen in the [[Folding Castle]]'s Detention Quadrant.<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' vol. 1 #103</ref>

Blob later resurfaces as a member of the [[X-Cell]], a group of depowered mutants that blames the government for the loss of their powers, attacking Mutant Town in defiance of the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. After mistakenly getting into a fight with [[Rictor]] and [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] and getting in a cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member [[Fatale (comics)|Fatale]], he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open manhole (left open earlier in the day by [[Strong Guy]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]) and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of Marrow, Blob was thrown from the car. He hasn't been seen since.

Apparently, upon his next appearance he will have become a "health and fitness guru".{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

==Powers and abilities==
Before being depowered, the Blob's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] physiology grants him a number of advantages. He has superhuman strength, endurance, and great resiliency to physical injury due to a further mutation. The Blob's elastic, blubbery skin has proven to be difficult to penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine's]] claws; though with sufficient force the claws can lacerate his flesh.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225</ref> On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] is sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself.  Magic can also overcome the Blob's resistance, as the magic swords of both [[Black Raazer]] and the [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] were able to harm him.  

He can also alter his personal mono-directional [[gravitation|gravity]] field beneath himself to make himself virtually immovable as long as he is in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he is standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #7</ref> and [[Strong Guy]] (powered-up near his limit by absorbing [[kinetic energy]]),<ref>''X-Factor'' vol.1, #107</ref> although [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #206</ref> Despite his morbidly obese appearance, the Blob's speed and agility is that of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.

The Blob's superhuman strength has greatly increased over the years, in a manner similar to that of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. This improvement is said to be a result of his ongoing mutation.

The Blob is vulnerable to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth and ears do not have the same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]] defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain.  Dukes can be incapacitated by drinking alcohol, although due to his immense mass, it requires a great amount.

==Other versions==
===''Age of Apocalypse''===
Blob appears briefly in the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' as a test subject that [[Dark Beast|Henry McCoy]] was toying with in the Breeding Pens in a direct violation of the Kelly Pact that [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] signed in order to keep the Human High Council occupied and at bay while he rallied his forces.

McCoy considered Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, and attacked his experimenter. [[Havok (comics)|Havoc]] came to McCoy's rescue, but Dukes proved to be even too much for the Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting for moments later the head of the pens, Havoc's older brother [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would put him back in his place.

When the Age of Apocalypse was revisited in the 10th anniversary, Blob was a member of [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]]'s team known as [[Sinister Six]]. It appears that McCoy had his powers altered in a manner that allowed Blob to project his gravitational field outward. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Dukes' new powers were used to sweep the X-Men off their feet with the [[Silver Samurai]] receiving a double dose. [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] attempted to fell the behemoth with multiple punches, but Dukes remained standing regardless of how many hits he got in. It was not until [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] stepped in with a punch that had the power necessary to overtake him that the mammoth would topple over. Following the Sinister Six's defeat, [[Psylocke]] was able to undo his mind control.

===''Cable & Deadpool''===
[[Cable & Deadpool|Deadpool's search for Cable]] across alternate timelines forces an encounter with the Blob of "an age of Apocalypse" (not to be confused with the [[Age of Apocalypse|X-Men story arc of the same name]]). In this reality, Blob has taken the mantle of Famine, one of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse#Other versions|Horsemen of Apocalypse]].<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #15</ref>

===[[House of M]]===
Blob is seen as a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. It was later revealed that Dukes is a member of an NYPD strike team called the Brotherhood<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
Blob appears twice in the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe. He is alive when first encountered, but being pursued by several zombie versions of Marvel characters, including Pyro and Toad. Later, he is revealed to have been similarly transformed, fighting alongside [[zombified]] members of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].

===Ultimate Blob===
[[Image:Ultimate Blob.jpg|200k|thumb|left|Ultimate Blob in a chokehold by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] with [[Toad (comics)|Toad's]] tongue around his arm.]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], Blob is a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutants]]. His powers are similar to that of his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, although he has been moved by a helicopter during the ''[[Weapon X#Ultimate Weapon X|Weapon X]]'' saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a female model/physicist named Naomi, who [[Cybersex|cyber-seduces]] the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Man]] [[Beast (comics)#Ultimate Beast|Beast]] — leading to the discovery of [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]]'s survival and, eventually, to the ''[[Ultimate War]]'' saga. 

Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Ultimate version of Blob may very well have additional superhuman-eating powers as part of his mutation, as not only has he threatened to actually eat his enemies live, he was expressly stated to have personally consumed all of the Weapon-X computers in a matter of moments when the Brotherhood invaded the Weapon-X compound to rescue the X-Men. Also, his real name is Franklin (Frank).

It has been revealed in [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] #120 that Blob is the estranged genetic father of [[Liz Allan]], who had recently discovered her mutant abilities; he claims to have impregnated her mother while working for a circus sideshow.

===What if?===
In one alternate reality, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], possessing the power of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], was able to throw the Blob bodily from a plane.<ref>What If? Vol.2, #66</ref>, providing another example of an exception to his immovability.
