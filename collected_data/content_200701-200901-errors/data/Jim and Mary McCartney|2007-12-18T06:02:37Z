'''James "Jim" McCartney''' ([[July 7]], [[1902]] &ndash; [[March 18]], [[1976]]) and '''Mary Patricia McCartney''' (née Mohan) ([[September 29]], [[1909]] &ndash; [[October 31]], [[1956]]) were the parents of musician, author and artist [[Paul McCartney]], best known for his work in [[The Beatles]] and [[Wings (band)|Wings]], and photographer and musician [[Mike McCartney]], who worked with [[The Scaffold]].

Like many families in Liverpool, the McCartney and Mohan families are from [[Ireland|Irish]] descent. Jim worked for most of his life in the [[cotton]] trade, as well as playing in [[ragtime]] and [[jazz]] bands in [[Liverpool]], while Mary was a trained [[nurse]] and [[midwife]]. 

The McCartney family lived in [[council house]]s during Mary's life, but Paul later bought his father a house called Rembrandt, in [[Heswall]], [[Cheshire]]. Jim encouraged his two sons to take up music by buying instruments for them to learn, as well as improving their status in life through education. Mary was Paul's inspiration for the song, "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]". After Mary’s death, Jim married Angela Williams and adopted her daughter from a previous marriage, [[Ruth McCartney]].

==Marriage==
<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->
Mary met her future husband during an air raid on Liverpool in 1940, when Jim was 40-years-old, and had settled into what his friends thought was, "a confirmed bachelorhood." Mary had been too career-conscious to think of marriage and, at 31-years-old, was thought of as a [[spinster]].<ref name="Spitzp73"> Spitz 2005 p73.</ref> They met in June 1940, at 11 Scargreen Avenue, [[West Derby]], as the McCartney family had gathered to celebrate the wedding of Jim's sister, Jin, to Harry Harris. Mary was staying with Harris family because of the lack of accommodation in Liverpool at the time.<ref name="Spitzp72"> Spitz 2005 p72.</ref> During the celebration, Mary sat quietly in an armchair, until the air-raid sirens sounded at 9:30. At that time, the group moved to the cellars to wait for the all-clear, but as there was an intensive bombing raid, the message did not come. Everyone was thus forced to sit in the cellar until dawn. Mary talked long enough with Jim to become romantically interested in him, and thought that he was "utterly charming and uncomplicated," as well as being entertained by his "considerable good humour."<ref name="Spitzp73"> Spitz 2005 p73.</ref> They took out a marriage licence at Liverpool Town Hall on [[8 April]] [[1941]], and were married a week later at St. Swithin’s Roman Catholic chapel in Gillmoss, West Derby, on [[15 April]] [[1941]].<ref name="Spitzp75"> Spitz 2005 p75.</ref> They first lived at 10 Sunbury Road, Liverpool, and then resided for a short time at 92 Broadway, [[Wallasey]], during November 1942. Jim's job at Napiers was classified as war work, so the McCartneys were given a small, but temporary, [[Prefabricated home|prefab]] house at 3 Roach Avenue, [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]].<ref name="MilesPage5"> Miles 1997 p5.</ref> 

Mary's job enabled the McCartneys to move to a ground-floor flat at 75 Sir Thomas White Gardens, off St. Domingo Road in Everton, to live in a rent-free flat that was supplied by her employers.<ref name="Spitzp76"> Spitz 2005 p76.</ref><ref name="MilesPage5"> Miles 1997 p5.</ref> They moved shortly after, in February 1946, to 72 Western Avenue in [[Speke]].<ref name="Spitzp78"> Spitz 2005 p78.</ref><ref>[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=72+Western+Avenue+Speke,+Liverpool&sll=53.427908,-2.971845&sspn=0.008924,0.014312&ie=UTF8&ll=53.343529,-2.851306&spn=0.002235,0.003578&t=h&z=18&iwloc=addr&om=1  72 Western Avenue in Speke, Liverpool.] google.co.uk/maps - Retrieved 4 October 2007 </ref> In 1948, the family moved again to 12 Ardwick Road (also in Speke) which was part of a new [[council estate|estate]] in the suburbs of Liverpool.<ref name="MilesPage5"> Miles 1997 p5.</ref><ref name="MilesPage9"> Miles 1997 p9.</ref><ref>[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=12+Ardwick+Road+Speke,+Liverpool&sll=53.343529,-2.851306&sspn=0.002235,0.003578&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1  12 Ardwick Road in Speke, Liverpool.] google.co.uk/maps - Retrieved 4 October 2007 </ref> The frequent moves to better areas was Mary's idea, as she wanted to raise her children in the best neighbourhood possible.<ref name="MilesPage15"> Miles 1997 p15.</ref>

As Mary was a Roman Catholic and Jim a Church of England [[Protestant]]—who later turned [[agnostic]]—their children were baptized [[Roman Catholic]] but raised [[non-denominational]]ly, although Mary had married Jim on the promise that any children would be baptised in the Catholic faith.

He said that he had dreamt of his mother, and the "Mother Mary" lyric was about her.<ref name="h2g2McCartneybiog"/> He later said, "It was great to visit with her again. I felt very blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing 'Let It Be'."<ref name="MilesPage20"> Miles 1997 p20.</ref><ref name="HarryBeatlesEncyclopedia"/>

In 1974, Paul collaborated with father Jim to create a song entitled "Walking in the Park with Eloise", a very upbeat tune, and was released by Paul McCartney & Wings under the pseudonym "The Country Hams". The Country Hams' single was backed with a tune entitled "Bridge on the River Suite". Both songs can be found on the CD ''[[Wings at the Speed of Sound]]'' from [[The Paul McCartney Collection]].
