The '''Blue Ensign''' is a [[flag]], one of several [[British ensigns]], used by certain organisations or territories associated with the [[United Kingdom]].  It is used either plain, or [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a badge or other emblem.  

The evolution of the Blue Ensign followed that of the [[Union Flag]]. The ensign originated in the 1600s with the [[St. George's cross]] (see [[Flag of England]]) in the canton, and with a blue field background (top right).  

The [[Act of Union 1707]]  united Scotland, England and Wales in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and produced a new blue ensign which placed the Union Flag in the canton. With the [[Act of Union 1800]], [[Ireland]] joined the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Flag|St Patrick's Cross]] was added to the [[Union Flag]] of the United Kingdom and, accordingly, to the cantons of the British ensigns from 1 January [[1801]].

==Plain blue ensign==
Prior to the reorganisation of the [[Royal Navy]] in [[1864]], the plain blue ensign had been the ensign of one of three squadrons of the Royal Navy, the "Blue Squadron."  This changed in 1864, when an order in council provided that the Red Ensign was allocated to merchantmen, the Blue Ensign was to be flag of ships in public service or commanded by an officer in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], and the White Ensign was allocated to the Navy.   

Thus, after 1864, the plain blue ensign is permitted to be worn, instead of the [[Red Ensign]], by two categories of civilian vessel:-
* British merchant vessels whose officers and crew include a certain number of retired [[Royal Navy]] personnel or Royal Navy reservists, or are commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Navy Reserve]] in possession of a Government warrant. The number and rank of such crew members required has varied over the years, as have the additional conditions required, since the system was first introduced in [[1864]].
* [[Yacht]]s belonging to members of certain long-established British yacht clubs, for example the [http://www.rncyc.com Royal Northern & Clyde Yacht Club]. Permission for yachts to wear the blue ensign (and other special yachting ensigns) was suspended during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

==Defaced blue ensign==
Since 1864, the Blue Ensign is [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a badge or emblem, to form the ensign of [[United Kingdom]] government departments or public bodies, for example:-

* Vessels belonging to members of certain British Yacht Clubs (for example, the [[Royal Harwich Yacht Club]])

* Government vessels of UK [[crown colony|overseas territories]].  This usage stems from the fact that in 1867–69, orders in council provided that the ensign for vessels in the service of any of the British colonies was to be the Blue Ensign, charged in the fly with the seal of the colony.  Any British colony with ships in its service thus had reason to use the Blue Ensign.  This worldwide, imperial use is the origin of the use of the Blue Ensign by many areas today, such as the Australian states.     

The defaced blue ensign was formerly used as:
* The [[Maritime flags#Jacks|jack]] of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] from its inception until the adoption of the [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf flag]] in [[1965]].  (see [http://tmg110.tripod.com/canada2.htm Flags of the Royal Canadian Navy 1910–1965]) The blue ensign was approved by the [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]] in [[1868]] for use by ships owned by the Canadian government.

* In the first half of the 20th century, Blue Ensigns for each province of Canada often appeared in charts of "all the world's flags", but these flags were just fantasies of the artists who drew the charts, and then copied by other artists putting together similar charts. They never existed in real life.
