'''Evolutionary thought''' has roots in antiquity as philosophical ideas conceived during the [[Ancient Greek]] and Roman eras.  The idea of biological [[evolution]] dates back to the sixth century B.C. musings of [[Anaximander]], who articulated a theory of the aquatic descent of mankind.  Scientific formulations of the idea did not arise until the 18th and 19th centuries A.D., when scientists such as [[Lord Monboddo]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Charles Darwin]]'s grandfather, proposed that living organisms were derived from a common ancestor.  The first scientific hypothesis was the principle of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], proposed by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in 1809.  Lamarck posited that: organisms developed new habits when subjected to a changing environment; these new habits resulted in structural changes; and these structural changes were [[heredity|transmitted]] to descendants.  Scant evidence supporting this hypothesis was found, but the Lamarckian theory commanded a preeminent place in biological thought for nearly 50 years.<ref name ="Burns_et_el">{{cite book | last = Burns| first = Edward M. | coauthors = Philip Lee Ralph, Robert E.

Darwin emphasized the difference between two main points: establishing the fact of biological evolution, and proposing the theory of [[natural selection]] to explain its mechanism.

Although Darwin's theory offered a substantive explanation of a wealth of biological observations, the mechanism of biological inheritance was not not yet known at the time of his work.  Although the person commonly considered the originator of modern genetic theory, [[Gregor Mendel]], was a contemporary of Darwin, Mendel's work was largely neglected until the early 20th century. The combination of the Darwinian proposal of natural selection with [[classical genetics]] is known as the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Later work identified the [[gene]], or the basic unit of inheritance in organisms, as encoded in [[DNA]] molecules carried by almost all living cells; subsequent work in [[molecular genetics]] has led to additional work in evolutionary theory such as the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]], which presents a role in biological evolution for [[genetic drift]] as well as natural selection.

==Pre-evolutionary thought==
===Belief in Ancient Philosophy===
====Plato and Theory of Forms====
Plato established the philosophy of [[essentialism]] which states, objects observed in the real world are reflections of a limited number of essences or ''eide''. Variation is merely the manifestation of imperfect reflections of constant essences. Plato called this the [[theory of forms]]. According to Plato, if God was perfect, then all forms of life must have been created. To leave any potential life unrealized would be a violation of the perfection of the highest power (this idea is called the [[plenitude principle]]).

====Aristotle and The Great Chain of Being====
[[Aristotle]] is thought to be basis for an idea often called [[The Great Chain of Being]] (other names for this same idea are ''Ladder of Life'' and ''Scala Naturae''). His idea was that all species could be placed in order, from the "lowest" to the "highest," with worms on the bottom and God on the top. In Aristotle's view, the universe was ultimately perfect, and that meant that the Great Chain was also perfect. That meant that there were no empty links in the chain, and no link was represented by more than one species.

This basic concept highly influenced the thinking of centuries of [[Western civilization]]. In fact, it still holds a powerful influence over our thinking today. The Great Chain idea places some significant restraints upon the ways we think about species. For instance, if every link is occupied, and none are occupied twice, no species can ever move from one position to another, since to do so would leave one level empty and put two species on another. Thus, in Aristotle's perfect universe, species couldn't ever change and must remain ''fixed''. One of the great cultural changes over that century was the movement away from this restriction in thinking toward a more dynamic view of the natural world. Without this adjustment in thought, it is probable that [[Charles Darwin]] (and [[Alfred Wallace]]) would either never have conceived of evolutionary thought, or would have made no impression when they published their ideas.

===Effects on Taxonomy===
[[Carolus Linnaeus]], founding father of our [[Linnaean taxonomy|current taxonomic system]], began his study believing fixity of species. This heavily shaped his work in developing the field of taxonomy. He later qualified the belief after observing [[interbreeding]] between various species.<!--sounds dubious, please check--><ref>Knut Hagberg's ''Carl Linnaeus'' (London: 1952, 197) quotes from Linnaeus' ''Dissertation on Perloris'' (1744) to show that Linnaeus conceded that it was "possible for new species to arise".</ref> 

Because of Linnaeus' original belief, ''fixity of species'' is sometimes referred to as the "Linnaean Lawn", a metaphor used in comparison with a [[phylogenetic tree]] and a [[Common descent#Creationist_Orchard|creationist orchard]].

==From ancient times to 1850s==
{{seealso|History of creationism|Evolutionism}}

The idea of biological evolution was supported in ancient times, notably among [[Hellenist]]s such as [[Anaximander]], [[Empedocles]], [[Democritus]] and his student [[Epicurus]]. As early as 400 BC the Greek [[atomists]] taught that the sun, earth, life, humans, civilization, and society emerged over aeons without [[divine intervention]]. Around [[60 BC]] the Roman atomist [[Lucretius]] wrote the poem [[On the Nature of Things]] describing the development of the living earth in stages from atoms colliding in the void as swirls of dust, then early plants and animals springing from the early earth's substance, to a succession of animals including a series of progressively less brutish humans. There are also suggestions of an evolutionary approach in ancient [[History of India|Indian]] texts (especially the [[Vedas]] and the writings of [[Patañjali]]) and [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese]] thought (for example, according to [[Joseph Needham]], [[Taoism]] explicitly denied the fixity of biological species).

Whereas evolutionary ideas more or less died out in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, they continued to be propounded in the [[Islamic]] world. For example [[Al-Jahiz]] considered the effects of the environment on the likelihood of an animal to survive, and [[Ibn al-Haitham]] went even further, writing a book in which he argued explicitly for evolutionism (although not natural selection), and numerous other Islamic scholars and scientists (for example, the great polymath [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]]) discussed (and developed) these ideas. Translated into Latin, these works began to appear in the West after the [[Renaissance]] and probably had a large (though subterranean) impact on Western science. 

In [[17th century]] English the word ''evolution'' (from the Latin word "evolutio", meaning "unroll like a scroll") began to be used to refer to an orderly sequence of events, particularly one in which the outcome was somehow contained within it from the start. In [[1677]] Sir [[Matthew Hale]] used the term ''evolution'' in attacking the atheistic atomism of Democritus and Epicurus. Hale set out the atomist idea that vibrations and collisions of atoms in the void without divine intervention had formed "Primordial Seeds" (semina) which were the "immediate, primitive, productive Principles of Men, Animals, Birds and Fishes." and called this mechanism an "absurdity" because "it must have potentially at least the whole Systeme of Humane Nature, or at least that Ideal Principle or Configuration thereof, in the evolution whereof the complement and formation of the Humane Nature must consist. . . and all this drawn from a fortuitous coalition of senseless and dead Atoms." Thus, among some ''[[evolutionism]]'' theories explored from [[1700]] to [[1850]], the earth, life, and universe developed without divine intervention. But most contemporary theories of evolution, including those developed by the German idealist philosophers [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Hegel]], held that evolution was a fundamentally spiritual process, with the entire course of natural and human evolution being "a self-disclosing revelation of the Absolute" (Schelling, ''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800).

Typically of these theorists, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in [[1714]] postulated "[[monad]]s" inside objects causing motion by internal forces, and maintained that "the 'germs' of all things have always existed . . . [and] contain within themselves an internal principle of development which drives them on through a vast series of metamorphoses" to become the geological formations, lifeforms, psychologies, and civilizations of the present. Leibniz clearly held that evolution proceeded on divine principles. In his ''De rerum originatione radicali'', 1697, he wrote that "A cumulative increase of the beauty and universal perfection of the works of God, a perpetual and unrestricted progress of the universe as a whole must be recognized, such that it advances to a higher state of cultivation."

Yet in his "Venus Physique" of [[1745]], [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] veered toward more materialistic ground, writing of "Chance" producing "an innumerable multitude of individuals" a small number of which had "fitness" to satisfy their needs, while "another infinitely greater number... perished... The species we see today are but the smallest part of what blind destiny has produced...", anticipating in general terms the idea of [[natural selection]]. 

Vague and general ideas of evolution continued to proliferate among the mid-eighteenth century philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. [[G. L. L. Buffon]], in a cautious, tentative fashion, suggested rather than stated the mutability of species and the influence of the forces of nature in moulding organisms. Darwin himself, in his foreword to the 6th edition of the ''[[Origin of Species]]'', credited [[Aristotle]] with foreshadowing the concept of [[natural selection]], and stated that "the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon". [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Universal Natural History and Theory of Heaven]]'' ([[1755]]), foreshadowed a theory of the development of unformed matter into the highest types of animals and plants, and suggested that the gradations of structure revealed by comparative anatomy pointed to the existence of blood relationship of all organisms, due to derivation from a common ancestor. He appeared to believe, however, that the successive variations and modifications had arisen in response to mechanical laws of the organisms themselves rather than to the influence of their surroundings. [[J. G. von Herder]] suggested that increase by multiplication with the consequent struggle for existence had played a large part in the organic world, but his theme remained vague and undeveloped. 

[[Charles Bonnet]] applied "Evolutionism" to biology in [[1762]], asserting that each feature of the embryo was preformed in the parts; some of which came from the egg and some from the sperm. The preformed parts expanded and rearranged themselves to grow into the adult, and so Bonnet was called a "preformationist."

===Acquired characteristics, Lamarckism, and natural selection===

Between [[1767]] and [[1792]] [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] included in his writings the concepts that man was derived from primates, and that creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals in response to their environment.  He also produced  research on the evolution of [[linguistics]]. Jan-Andrew Henderson states (Henderson, 2000) that Monboddo was the first to articulate the theory of [[natural selection]]. 

Between [[1794]] and [[1796]] [[Erasmus Darwin]] wrote ''[[Zoönomia]]'' suggesting "that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament ... with the power of acquiring new parts" in response to stimuli, with each round of "improvements" being inherited by successive generations. In his "Temple of Nature" of [[1802]] he described recurring new earths appearing in a cycle of catastrophes, then life springing forth spontaneously to populate the new earth, with animals competing with each other, driven by sex, hunger, "the strongest and most active ... [surviving to] propagate the species, which should thence become improved."  Erasmus Darwin cited the work of [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] in his ''Temple of Nature'' in 1802.

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed in his ''Philosophie Zoologique'' of [[1809]] a theory, later known as [[Lamarckism]], by which characteristics that were "needed" were acquired (or diminished) during the lifetime of an organism then passed on to the offspring. He saw this resulting in the development of species in a progressive chain of development towards higher forms. Lamarck avoided the word "evolution" as he was describing acquired traits, while popular notions of "evolution" at the time asserted Bonnet's "preformationist" idea that the parent passed on the "germs" given by the grandparents unaltered by the parent's "learning."

[[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] began the process of ordering [[rock strata]] by examining fossils in the layers. Independently, [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Alexandre Brongniart]] published their explanation of the antiquity of the Earth in [[1811]] on the principle of [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] succession of the layers of the earth, but rejected evolution in favour of [[catastrophism]].

In [[1813]], [[William Charles Wells]] produced essays assuming that there had been evolution of humans, and recognised the principle of [[natural selection]]. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were unaware of this work when they jointly published the theory in [[1858]], but Darwin later acknowledged that Wells had recognised the principle before them. 
[[A. P. de Candolle|Augustin de Candolle]]'s ''natural system'' of classification laid emphasis on the "war" between competing species. 

A radical British school of comparative anatomy which included the surgeon [[Robert Knox]] and the [[anatomist]] [[Robert Edmund Grant]] was closely in touch with Lamarck's school of French ''Transformationism'', which included [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. Grant developed Lamack's and Erasmus Darwin's ideas of [[transmutation]] and [[evolutionism]], investigating [[homology (biology)|homology]] to prove [[common descent]]. As a young student [[Charles Darwin]] joined Grant in investigations of the life cycle of marine animals. He also studied geology under professor [[Robert Jameson]] who wrote an anonymous paper in [[1826]] praising "Mr. Lamarck" for explaining how the higher animals had "evolved" from the "simplest worms" – this was the first use of the word "evolved" in a modern sense. Jameson's course closed with lectures on the ''"Origin of the Species of Animals"''. 

[[Patrick Matthew]] wrote in ''Naval Timber & Arboriculture'' published in [[1831]] of "continual balancing of life to circumstance. ... [The] progeny of the same parents, under great differences of circumstance, might, in several generations, even become distinct species, incapable of co-reproduction." Charles Darwin found out about it after publication of the ''Origin'', and wrote that it "briefly but completely anticipates the theory of Nat. Selection ... a complete but not developed anticipation!"

The geologist [[Charles Lyell]], in the second volume of his ''Principles of Geology'' ([[1830]]-[[1833]]), criticized and dismissed Lamarck's theories of development. Instead, he advocated a form of progressive creation, in which each species had its "centre of creation" and was designed for the habitat, but would go extinct when the habitat changed. [[John Herschel]] supported this gradualist view and wrote to Lyell urging a search for natural laws underlying the "mystery of mysteries" of how species formed.

The computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] published his unofficial ''Ninth [[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in [[1837]], putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required. 

By [[1836]] the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] had theories influenced by [[Johannes Peter Müller]] that living matter had an "organising energy", a life-force that directed the growth of tissues and also determined the lifespan of the individual and of the species. In the [[1850s]] Owen developed ideas of "archetypes" in the Divine mind producing a sequence of species in "ordained continuous becoming" in which new species appeared at birth, not through natural selection.

[[Image:Darwins first tree.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Darwin's first sketch of an evolutionary tree from his ''First Notebook on Transmutation of Species'' (1837)]]

In [[1837]] Charles Darwin started the first of a series of secret notebooks on [[transmutation]]. In [[1838]] he read the new 6th edition of [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus's]] ''Essay on the Principle of Population'' and compared this with breeders selecting traits. This led to the [[inception of Darwin's theory]], and the [[publication of Darwin's theory]] jointly with [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] in [[1858]]. Wallace considered Malthus' essay the most important book he read, and considered it "the most interesting coincidence" that both he and Darwin were independently led to the theory of evolution through reading Malthus.  Charles Darwin was influenced by earlier writers including his grandfather [[Erasmus Darwin]]. 

Another important work was the ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', published anonymously in England in 1844. The actual author was the Scottish journalist [[Robert Chambers]]. It proposed a theory of evolution, modeled somewhat after that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], but based on [[embryology]] and [[recapitulation]], and created considerable political controversy in Victorian society for its radicalism and unorthodoxy. The work put forward a theory of development which encompassed everything from the solar system to animals and human intelligence. Darwin later remarked in the  preface to the 3rd edition of the ''Origin of Species'' that, with respect to ''Vestiges'' "In my opinion it has done excellent service in this country in calling attention to the subject, in removing prejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for the reception of analogous views."

===Later discrediting of Lamarckism and Orthogenesis===
[[Lamarckism]] became discredited as experiments simply did not support the concept that purely "acquired traits" were inherited. The mechanisms of [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]] and the notion of the [[Weismann barrier]] were not elucidated until later in the 19th century, after Lamarck's death.   Lamarckism ''in toto'' has largely been discredited as a mechanism in evolution, although some scientists such as [[Eva Jablonka]] and colleagues have claimed that certain forms of [[epigenetic inheritance]] such as [[chromatin]] marking and [[DNA methylation]] may involve a form of "soft" Larmarckian evolution, although these claims are controversial.  Some have also proposed that Lamarckian evolution may be accurately applied to [[cultural evolution]].

[[Orthogenesis]] or orthogenetic evolution was the [[hypothesis]] that life has an innate tendency to move, in a unilinear fashion, to ever greater perfection. 
This hypothesis had a significant following in the [[19th century]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] himself accepted the idea, where it had a central role in his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics.  Other proponents included [[Leo Berg]], [[Henri Bergson]] and, for a time, the paleontologist [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]].  Orthogenesis was particularly accepted by paleontologists who believed that fossils indicated a gradual and constant unidirectional change.  Those who accepted orthogenesis in this way, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism that drove orthogenesis was [[teleological]] (goal-directed).

The orthogenesis hypothesis began to collapse when it became clear that it could not explain the patterns found by [[paleontology|paleontologists]] in the [[fossil record]], which was non-linear with many complications.  A few hung on to the orthogenesis hypothesis as late as the [[1950s]] by claiming that the processes of [[macroevolution]], the long term trends in evolution, were distinct from the processes of [[microevolution]].

===Anticipation of Darwinian thought===
Although the pre-Darwinian writers amongst them invoked nearly every principle that Darwin or his successors have suggested, they failed to carry conviction with regard to evolution, and they neither propounded a coherent philosophy of variation nor suggested a mechanism by which variations that appeared might give rise to new species. The anticipations of Darwin were little more than formal and verbal. As [[T. H. Huxley]] pointed out in his essay on the reception of the ''Origin of Species'' in the second volume of ''Darwins Life and Letters'':

<blockquote>
''The suggestion that new species may result from the selective action of external conditions upon the variations from their specific type which individuals present and which we call spontaneous because we are ignorant of their causation is as wholly unknown to the historian of scientific ideas as it was to biological specialists before 1858. But that suggestion is the central idea of the ''Origin of Species'', and contains the quintessence of Darwinism.''
</blockquote>

==1850s - early 20th century: Darwin's theory==
{{main|Inception of Darwin's theory|Development of Darwin's theory|Publication of Darwin's theory|Reaction to Darwin's theory}}

While transmutation of species was accepted by a sizeable number of scientists before [[1859]], it was the publication of Charles Darwin's ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' which provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection. Darwin was motivated to publish his work on evolution after receiving a letter from [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], in which Wallace revealed his own discovery of natural selection. As such, Wallace is sometimes given shared credit for the theory of evolution. However, Wallace himself backed away from claiming too much credit, admitting that Darwin's formulation of the theory and his work on evolution went far beyond Wallace's conjectures in scope and explanatory power (he would later, to Darwin's great disappointment, back away from the idea that the human mind evolved by natural means as he began to turn towards [[spiritualism]]).

[[Image:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s frontispiece to ''Evidence as to Man's place in Nature'' (1863).]]

Wilkins [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/darwin-precursors.html] identifies Darwin's into seven categories:

#[[Transmutationism]] 
#[[Common descent]]
#[[Struggle for existence]]
#[[Natural selection]]
#[[Sexual selection]]
#[[Biogeographic distribution]]
#[[Heredity]]

Darwin's theory, though it succeeded in profoundly shaking scientific opinion regarding the development of life (and indeed resulted in a small social revolution), could not explain several critical components of the evolutionary process. Namely, he was unable to explain the source of variation in traits within a species, and he could not provide a mechanism whereby traits were passed faithfully from one generation to the next. Darwin's theory of [[pangenesis]], while relying in part on the inheritance of acquired characteristics, proved to be useful for statistical models of evolution developed by his cousin [[Francis Galton]] and the "biometric" school of evolutionary thought. It was, however,  found to be of little use to biologists.

===Expanding Darwin's theory: the Mendelian-biometrician debates===

While the scientific community generally accepted that evolution had occurred, many disagreed that it had happened under the conditions or mechanisms provided by Darwin. In the years immediately following Darwin's death, evolutionary thought fractured into a number of interpretations, include neo-Darwinism, neo-Larmarckism, [[orthogenesis]], [[Mendel]]ism, the [[biometric]] approach, and [[mutationism|mutation theory]]. Eventually this boiled down to a debate between two camps. The Mendelians, advocating discrete variation, were led by [[William Bateson]] (who coined the word [[genetics]]) and [[Hugo de Vries]] (who coined the word [[mutation]]). Their opponents were the biometricians, advocating continuous variation; their leaders [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon]], following in the tradition of [[Francis Galton]]. 

An important issue in the debate between the Mendelians and the biometricians was the nature of variation in species. Darwin and Wallace believed that small variations were more important than large ones, since small variations hewed closely to an already-proven model. The biometricians agreed with this position, while the Mendelians insisted that discontinuous species were unlikely to arise from a continuous process of change. While the immediate issue of [[speciation]] was resolved in large part by the clear definition of a species as a reproductively isolated population, the rate of evolution would arise again as a point of contention in the late 20th century with the proposal of [[punctuated equilibrium]]. Most other questions resolving variation were resolved with the recognition that the size of a [[genotypic]] change did not always correspond with the size of the resulting [[phenotypic]] change.

Another source of clashes between Mendelians and biometricians was the debate over the origins of variation. Mendelians argued for [[intrinsic]] variations originating from [[Genetics|genetic]] transmission; biometricians, observing primarily the [[phenotype]] of the organism, were not yet prepared to abandon [[Lamarckian]] views on the heritability of acquired characteristics. [[August Weismann]] was among those who demonstrated that acquired characteristics were not always inherited, pointing out the existence of worker [[ant]]s and worker [[bee]]s, and the importance of '[[germ plasm]]' or [[gametes]] in the biology of reproduction. The recognition of means of postnatal [[adaptation]] as inherited traits did much to explain acquired characteristics. 

Today, it is recognized that most acquired features of an organism change only the [[somatic cells]] of an organism and play no part in heredity or evolution. Acquired and inheritable, or  [[epigenetic]], traits do exist -- for example [[prion]]s and [[DNA methylation]]. However, the vast majority of the features of an organism are considered to be either inherited through the [[DNA]] of the parent(s) or induced after birth. Elucidating which observed phenotypes are genetically inherited and which are environmentally induced remains an important and ongoing part of the study of [[genetics]], [[developmental biology]], and [[medicine]]. 

The ideas of both the Mendelian and biometric campus were assembled into the modern evolutionary synthesis by the 1930s. Both camps had valid points: modern theory describes how Mendelian characteristics stem from monogenetic variation (mutations in one gene), while biometric characteristics stem from polygenetic variation (mutations in many genes).

==1920s-1940s: the modern evolutionary synthesis==
{{main|Modern evolutionary synthesis}}

These questions of interpretation were not settled until the early [[20th century]], beginning with the work of an Austrian [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monk named [[Gregor Mendel]] in the late [[19th century]], who outlined, through a series of ingeniously devised experiments, a model for inheritance of traits based on the fundamental unit of the [[gene]]. Mendel's work was unappreciated at the time and largely ignored by the biological community. When it was "rediscovered" in 1900, it led to a storm of conflict between Mendelians ([[Charles Benedict Davenport]]) and biometricians ([[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon]] and [[Karl Pearson]]), who insisted that the great majority of traits important to evolution must show continuous variation that was not explainable by Mendelian analysis.

Eventually, the two models were reconciled and merged, primarily through the work of the biologist and statistician [[R.A. Fisher]]. This combined approach, applying a rigorous statistical model to Mendel's theories of inheritance via genes, became known in the 1930s and 1940s as the modern synthesis of Darwin's theory.

==1940s-1960s: developments following molecular biology==

In the 1940s, following up on [[Griffith's experiment]], [[Oswald Avery|Avery]], [[Colin MacLeod|MacLeod]] and [[Maclyn McCarty|McCarty]] definitively identified [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)]] as the "transforming principle" responsible for transmitting genetic information. In [[1953]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] published their famous paper on the structure of DNA, based on the research of [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]]. These developments ignited the era of [[molecular biology]] and transformed the understanding of evolution into a molecular process: the mutation of segments of DNA.

During this era of [[molecular biology]], it also became clear that a major mechanism for variation within a population is [[mutagenesis|mutations]] of [[DNA]]. 
In the mid-1970s, [[Motoo Kimura]] formulated the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]], firmly establishing the importance of [[genetic drift]] as a major mechanism of evolution. The theory sparked the "neutralist-selectionist" debate, partially solved by the development of [[Tomoko Ohta]]'s [[nearly neutral theory of evolution]].

==1960s-1980s: Gene centered view of evolution, punctuated equilibrium==

[[Image:Stephen Jay Gould.png|right|frame|[[Stephen Jay Gould]], who, along with [[Niles Eldredge]] proposed the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] in 1972]]

In the mid-1960s, [[George C. Williams]] strongly critiqued verbal explanations of adaptations couched in terms of "survival of the species" (essentially [[group selection]] arguments).  Such explanations were largely replaced by a [[gene-centered view of evolution]], epitomised by the [[kin selection]] arguments of [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[George Price]] and [[John Maynard Smith]]. Models of the period showed that [[group selection]] was severely limited in its strength, although these models have since been shown to be too limited and newer models do admit the possibility of significant multi-level selection. 

One of the most prominent debates arising during this time period was over the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], a theory propounded by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] to describe and account for the pattern of fossil species persisting phenotypically unchanged for long periods (what they termed ''stasis''), with relatively brief periods of phenotypic change during speciation.

==1970s-2000s: evolutionary biology as a discipline==
[[Evolutionary biology]] as an [[academic discipline]] in its own right emerged as a result of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] in the [[1930s]] and [[1940s]].   It was not until the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]], however, that a significant number of universities had departments that specifically included the term ''evolutionary biology'' in their titles.  In the [[United States]], as a result of the rapid growth of [[molecular biology|molecular]] and [[cell biology]], many universities have split (or aggregated) their biology departments into ''molecular and cell biology''-style departments and ''ecology and evolutionary biology''-style departments (which often have subsumed older departments in [[paleontology]], [[zoology]] and the like).

[[Microbiology]] has recently developed into an evolutionary discipline. It was originally ignored due to the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage our extensive understanding of microbial physiology, the ease of microbial [[genomics]], and the quick generation time of some microbes to answer evolutionary questions. Similar features have led to progress in [[virus|viral]] evolution, particularly for [[bacteriophage]].

==Recent developments in evolutionary theory==

[[Daniel Dennett]] (1995) argues in ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'' that natural selection is an algorithmic process applicable to many circumstances besides biological evolution.  This conception of evolutionary has been dubbed "universal Darwinism".

===Symbiogenesis===
{{main|Symbiogenesis}}

Another extension to the standard modern synthesis, advocated by [[Lynn Margulis]], is symbiogenesis.   Symbiogenesis argues that acquisition and accumulation of random [[mutation]]s or [[genetic drift]] are not sufficient to explain how new inherited variations occur in [[evolution]]. This theory states that species arise from the merger of independent organisms through [[symbiosis]]. Symbiogenesis emphasizes the impact of [[co-operation]] rather than Darwinian competition.  This commonly occurs in [[multigenomic organism]]s throughout nature.

===Evo-devo===
{{main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

Molecular data regarding the mechanisms underlying [[developmental biology|development]] started to accrue quickly during the 1980's and '90's.  As scientists began to compare the developmental mechanisms in different organisms, they realized that these mechanisms are conserved through deep evolutionary time. By combining the disciplines of [[phylogenetics]], [[paleontology]] and comparative developmental biology, scientists try to infer the way in which early organisms developed, thus spawning the new discipline of "evo-devo."

===Neo-structuralist themes in evolutionary theory===

In the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]] there was a renewal of [[structuralism|structuralist]] themes in evolutionary biology by biologists such as [[Brian Goodwin]],  that incorporates ideas from [[cybernetics]] and [[systems theory]], and that emphasizes the role of [[self-organization|self-organized]] processes as being at least as important as the role of [[natural selection]].  

It is hypothesized, for example, that the rapid emergence of basic metazoan body plans in the [[Cambrian Explosion]] was due in part to changes in the environment acting on inherent properties of cell aggregates, such as differential cell adhesion.  Such material-based [[phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] led to the spontaneous emergence of metazoan body forms. The resulting forms were later “locked in” by means of stabilizing natural selection. Developmental biologists [[Stuart Newman]] and Gerd B. Müller have presented recent work relating to this view in the edited volume, [[Origination of Organismal Form]].

Some variants of this view consider neo-Darwinian forms of natural selection to characterize evolution only in its advanced stages (i.e., after stabilization of the genotype-phenotype relationship has occurred), though most neo-structuralist biologists would not go this far.

===Altruism===
{{main|Altruism}}

[[Altruism]] has been one of the last (and most deeply embedded) thorns in the side of [[evolutionary theory]], but recent developments in [[game theory]] have suggested explanations with an evolutionary context.
If  [[humans]] evolved, then so did human [[minds]], and if minds evolved, then so does behaviour - including, according to these models, altruistic tendencies.

Theories of [[eusociality]] and the undoubted advantages of [[kin selection]] have made good progress in this direction, but they are far from unproblematic. Some writers have pointed out that the [[conscience]] is just another aspect of our mental behaviour, and propose an evolutionary explanation for the existence of conscience and therefore altruism. One recent suggestion, expressed most eloquently by the philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], was initially developed when considering the problem of so-called 'free riders' in the [[tragedy of the commons]], a larger-scale version of the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]].

===Horizontal gene transfer===
{{main|Horizontal gene transfer}}

"While horizontal gene transfer is well-known among bacteria, it is only within the past 10 years that its occurrence has become recognized among higher plants and animals. The scope for horizontal gene transfer is essentially the entire biosphere, with bacteria and viruses serving both as intermediaries for gene trafficking and as reservoirs for gene multiplication and recombination (the process of making new combinations of genetic material)."

==Unconventional extensions to evolutionary ideas==
===Teilhard de Chardin's and Huxley's theories===

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and [[Julian Huxley]] formulated theories describing the gradual development of the Universe from subatomic particles to human society, considered by Teilhard as the last stage. (see [[Gaia theory]]). These are not generally recognized as scientifically rigorous.

Nine levels of development are described in their [http://noosphere.cc/evolutiontendencies.html scheme]. Stages one through five are grouped into the [[Lithosphere]], also called [[Geosphere]] or [[Physiosphere]], where the evolution of the structure of organisms is ruled by mechanical laws and coincidence. Levels six, seven, and eight are the classical biological stages. Stages six through eight are collectively called the [[Biosphere]], where the progress of the structure of the organisms is ruled by genetic mechanisms. The last stage, stage 9, is called the [[Noosphere]], where the structure of human society is ruled by psychological, informational and communicative processes.
