[[Image:American Society.jpg|thumb|250px|This graphic shows the distribution of gross annual household income. The building's thirty exposed floors are easily divided into quintiles, each income quintile represented by six floors. Each floor represents the tenth of a third (3.33%) of households in the US, and each section of 10 floors represent roughly one third of American society. The floors above the top black line represent those households with incomes of or exceeding $100,000. The floors below the bottom black line, however, represent those households who fell below the poverty threshold. In order to live on the top floor of the American income strata, a household's annual gross income needs to exceed $200,000.]]

The '''Household income in the United States''' is a measure of current private income commonly used by the [[United States]] government and private institutions. To measure the income of a household, the pre-tax money receipts of all residents over the age of 15 are combined. Most of these receipts are in the form of wages and salaries (before withholding and other taxes), but many other forms of income, such as unemployment insurance, disability, child support, etc., are included as well.  The residents of the household do not have to be related to the householder for their earnings to be considered part of the household's income.<ref name="Definition of household income">{{cite web|url=http://www.sccommunityprofiles.org/glossary.asp|title=Definition of household income|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> While the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted as households tend to share a common economic fate, the size of a household which is commonly not considered may off-set gains in household income.<ref name="The American Class Strucutre">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Strucutre | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | id = 0-534-50520-1}}</ref>

The 2005 economic survey also found that households in the top two [[income quintiles]], those with an annual household income exceeding $55,331, had a [[median]] of two income earners while those in the lower quintiles (2nd and middle quintile) had median of only one income earner per household.

===Quintiles===

Households are often divided into quintiles according to their gross income.  Each quintile represents 20%, or one fifth, of the population.  

Household type is strongly correlated with household income.  Married couples are disproportionately represented in the upper two quintiles, compared to the general population of households.  Cross-referencing shows that this is likely due to the presence of multiple income earners in these families. Non-family households (individuals) are disproportionately represented in the lower two quintiles.  Households headed by single males are disproportionately found in the middle three quintles; single females head households concentrated in the bottom three quintiles.

The highest income households are almost ten times as likely to own their homes rather than rent, but in the lowest quintile, the ratio of owners to renters is nearly one to one.

The [[New York Times]] has used the quintiles to define [[social class in the United States|class]].  It has assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as [[lower class]], [[lower middle class]], [[middle class]], [[upper middle class]], and [[upper class]].<ref name="New York Times definition of class according to the quintiles">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/national/20050515_CLASS_GRAPHIC/index_01.html|title=New York Times definition of class according to the quintiles|accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref>

Overall "…[a]verage earnings ranged from $18,900 for [[Educational attainment in the United States|high school dropouts]] to $25,900 for [[Educational attainment in the United States|high school graduates]], $45,400 for [[Educational attainment in the United States|college graduates]] and $99,300 for workers with [[Educational attainment in the United States|professional degrees]] (M.D., D.O., J.D., D.D.S., or D.V.M.). <ref name="US Census Bureau on Education and Income">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p23-210.pdf|title=US Census Bureau on Education and Income|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref> 

Considering how education significantly enhances the earnings potential of individuals, it should come as no surprise that individuals with [[graduate degree]]s have an average [[per capita income]] exceeding the [[median household income]] of [[Census family|married couple families]] among the general population ($63,813).<ref name="US Census Bureau on Education and Income">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p23-210.pdf|title=US Census Bureau on Education and Income|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref><ref name="Infoplease, median household income">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104688.html|title=Infoplease, median household income|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>  Higher [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] did not, however, help close the income gap between the genders as the life-time earnings for a male with a professionals degree were roughly forty percent (39.59%) higher than those of a female with a [[Educational attainment in the United States|professionals degree]].  The life-time earnings gap between males and females was the smallest for those individuals holding an [[Educational attainment in the United States|Associate degrees]] with male life-time earnings being 27.77% higher than those of females. While [[educational attainment]] did not help reduce the [[income inequality]] between men and women, it did increase the earnings potential of individuals of both sexes, greatly enabling many households with (a) [[Educational attainment in the United States|graduate degree]] householder(s) to enter the top household income quintile.<ref name="US Census Bureau on Education and Income">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p23-210.pdf|title=US Census Bureau on Education and Income|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref>

Household income also increased significantly with the [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] of the householder. The [[US Census Bureau]] publishes [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] and income data for all households with a householder who was aged twenty-five or older. The biggest income difference was between those with some college education and those who had a [[Bachelor's degree]], with the latter making $23,874 more. Income also increased substantially with increased post-secondary education. While the median household income for a household with a household holding an Associates degree was $51,970, the median household income for those with a Bachelor's degree or higher was $73,446. Those with [[Doctorate degree|doctorates]] had the second highest median household with a median of $96,830; $18,289 more higher than that for those at the [[Master's degree]] level, but $3,170 lower than the median for households with a professionals degree holding householder.<ref name="Educational attainment and median household income">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/histinc/h13.html|title=Educational attainment and median household income|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref>

The change in median personal and household since 1991 also varied greatly with [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]]. While, both the overall median personal and household icome increased since 1991, this increase did not take place on all levels of [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]]. The overall income increased over the course of the 1990s, reaching its high in 1999, but decreasing has been ever since. In 1991 the median household income in the [[United States|US]] was $40,873 in 2003 dollars, while the median household income in 2003 was $45,016. In 1999, however, the median household income was $46,236, 2.7% higher than today. While this trend held true for all levels of educational attainment the extend of chorinical falcutations in income were greatly influenced by educational attainment. Overall the median household and personal income decreased for those with more than a 9th grade education but less than a four-year college degree since 1991. In other words, the median household income decreased for households and individuals at the high school drop-outs and graduate, some-college, and an [[Associates degree]] level. Income did, however, increase for those with a [[Bachelor's degree]] or more. The following table shows the median household income according to the educational attainment of the householder.

===Age of householder===
Household income in the [[United States]] varies substantially with the age of the person who heads the household. Overall the median household income increased with the age of householder until [[retirement age]] when household income started to decline.<ref name="US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new02_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder|accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref> The highest median household income was found among households headed by working [[baby-boomers]].<ref name="US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new02_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder|accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref> Households headed by persons between the ages of 45 and 54 had a median household income of $61,111 and a mean household income of $77,634. The [[median income per member of household]] for this particular group was $27,924. The highest median income per member of household was among those between the ages of 54 and 64 with $30,544. The group with the second highest median household income, were households headed by persons between the ages 35 and 44 with a median income of $56,785, followed by those in the age group between 55 and 64 with $50,400. Not surprisingly the lowest income group was compromised of those household headed by individuals younger than 24, followed by those headed by persons over the age of 75. Overall households headed by persons above the age of seventy-five had a median household income of $20,467 with the median household income per member of household being $18,645. These figures support the general assumption that median household income as well as the [[median income per member of household]] peaked among those households headed by middle aged persons, increasing with the age of the householder and the size of the household until the householder reaches the age of 64. With retirement income replacing salaries and the size of the household declining, the median household income decreases as well.<ref name="US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new02_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder|accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref>

===Aggregate income distribution===
The aggregate income measures the combined income earned by all persons in a particular income group. Overall all households in the [[United States]] earned roughly $4,286,391 million in 2005 (4.3 trillion). Roughly one third, 32.5%, of all income in the US was earned by those households with an income over $150,000, approximately the top five percent. Approximately one fifth, 20.58%, of all income was earned by the top 2.67%, those households earning more than $200,000 a year. Overall the [[aggregate income]] distributing tilts toward the top, despite the fact that households with middle-range annual incomes ranging from $50,000 to $75,000 earned roughly one fourth, 25.11% of all income. As the percentage of middle-range income households is roughly one-fourth of the population, this particular income group's share of income is roughly equal to their representation in the general population. The bottom 6.37%, however only earned 0.27% of all income.<ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>

Since 1967, the median household income in the [[United States]] has risen modestly, fluctuating several times. Even though personal income has risen substantially and 42% of all household now have two income earners, the median household income has increased only slightly. According to the [[US Census Bureau]], this paradoxial set of trends is due to the changing structure of American households. For example, while the proportion of wives working year-round in married couple households with children has increased fron 17% in 1967 to 39% in 1996, the proportion of such households among the general population has decreased. Thus, while married couple households with children are the most economically prosperous type of household in the United, their share of the population has been dwindling in the [[United States]]. In 1969, more than 40% of all households consisted of a married couple with children. By 1996 only a rough quarter of US households consisted of married couples with children. As a result of these changing [[Demographics of the United States|household demographics]], median household income rose only slighly despite an ever increasing female labor force and a considerable increase in the percentage of [[Educational attainment in the United States|college graduates]].<ref name="Income from 1969 to 1996, US Census Bureau">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/3/98pubs/p23-196.pdf|title=Income from 1969 to 1996, US Census Bureau|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref>

{{cquote|
"From 1969 to 1996, median household income rose a very modest 6.3 percent in constant dollars... The 1969 to 1996 stagnation in median household income may, in fact, be largely a reflection of changes in the size and composition of households rather than a reflection of a stagnating economy."- John McNeil, US Census Bureau
}}

Overall, the median household income rose from $33,338 in 1967 to an all-time high of $44,922 in 1999, and has since decreased slightly to $43,318. Decreases in household income are visible during each [[recession]], while increases are visible during economic upturns. These fluctuations were felt across the income strata as the incomes of both, the 95th and 20th percentile were affected by fluctuations in the economy. Yet, it is important to note that income in the period between 1967 and 1999 grew faster among wealthier households than it did among poorer households. For example the household income for the 80th precentile, the lower threshold for the [[Income quintiles|top quintile]], rose from $55,265 in 1967 to $86,867 in 2003, a 57.2% increase. The median household income rose by 30% while the income for the 20th percentile (the lower threshold for the second lowest [[Income quintiles|quitile]]) rose by only 28% from $14,002 to $17,984. One should note that the majority of households in the [[Income quintiles|top quintile]] had two income earners, versus zero for the lowest quintile and that the widening gap between the top and lowest quintile may largely be the reflection of changing household demographics including the addition of women to the workforce.<ref name="Income and poverty since 1967, US Census Bureau">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p60-226.pdf|title=Income and poverty since 1967, US Census Bureau|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref><ref name="Income from 1969 to 1996, US Census Bureau">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/3/98pubs/p23-196.pdf|title=Income from 1969 to 1996, US Census Bureau|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref>

While per-capita, disposable income has increased 469% since 1972, it has only increased moderately when inflation is considered. In 1972, disposable personal income was determined to be $4,129; $19,385 in 2005 dollars. In 2005, disposable personal income was, however, $27,640, showing a moderate 43% increase.<ref name="Bureau of Economic Analysis">{{cite web|url=http://bea.gov/bea/newsrel/pinewsrelease.htm|title=US Personal Income News Release|accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref><ref name="Consumer Price Index Home Page, CPI-W">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/inflation.htm|title=Overview of BLS statistics on Inflation and Spending|accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref> Since 1990, household income has fallen slightly, but this does not take into account the decrease in average household size. <ref name="US Census Data">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-8.pdf|title=US Households and Families 2000|accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref>

==Median income==
The [[median]] income divides households in the US evenly in the middle with half of all household earning more than the median income and half of all households earning less than the median household income. In 2004 the median household income in the [[United States]] was $43,389.<ref name="Infoplease, median household income">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104688.html|title=Infoplease, median household income|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> According to the [[US Census Bureau]], the median is "considerably lower than the average, and provides a more accurate representation."<ref name="US Census Bureau on the nature the median in determining wealth">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/p70-88.pdf|title=US Census Bureau on the nature the median in determining wealth|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> Considering other racial and geographical inequities in regards to household income, it should come as no surprise that the [[median]] household income varies with [[race]], size of household and [[geography]]. The [[US state|state]] with the highest median household income in the United States was [[New Hampshire]] with $57,352, followed by [[New Jersey]], [[Maryland]] and [[Connecticut]], making the [[Northeastern United States]] the wealthiest area by income in the entire country.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median household income by state">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income04/statemhi.html|title=US Census Bureau, median household income by state|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> In terms of region the median household income was as follows: "[[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] ($47,994), [[Western United States|West]] ($47,680) and [[Southern United States|South]] ($40,773)." Median household income in the [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]] declined by 2.8% to $44,657.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median household income according to certain demographic characteristics">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/005647.html|title=US Census Bureau, median household income according to certain demographic characteristics|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> While median household income has tendency to increase up to four persons per household, it declines thereon after. This indicated that while four person households have larger incomes than those with one, two or three members, household with seem to earn progressively less as their size increases beyond four persons. According to the US Census Bureau 2004 Community Survey, two-person households had a median income of $39,755, with $48,957 for three-person households, $54,338 for four-person households, $50,905 for five-person households, $45,435 for six-person households, with seven-or-more-person households having the second lowest median income of only $42,471.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median family income by family size">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/medincsizeandstate.html|title=US Census Bureau, median family income by family size|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>. In terms of race, [[Asian-Americans]] households had the highest median household income of $57,518, [[European-American]] households ranked second with $48,977, [[Hispanic|Hispanic or Latino]] households ranked third with $34,241. [[African-American|African American or Black]] households had the lowest median household income of all races with $30,134.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median household income according to certain demographic characteristics">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/005647.html|title=US Census Bureau, median household income according to certain demographic characteristics|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>

==Mean income==
Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income. Unlike the median household income which divides all households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned by [[United States|American]] households. In the case of mean income, the income of all households is divided by the number of all households.<ref name="US Government, the different between mean and median">{{cite web|url=http://www.business.gov/topics/research_resources/market_research/census_bureau_faq.html|title=US Government, the different between mean and median|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top.<ref name="US Census Bureau on the nature the median in determining wealth">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/p70-88.pdf|title=US Census Bureau on the nature the median in determining wealth|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> As a result the mean tends to be higher as the median income with the top earning households boosting it. Overall the mean household income in the United States according to the [[US Census Bureau]] 2004 Economic Survey was $60,528, or $17,210 (39.73%) higher than the median household income.<ref name="US Census Bureau, mean household income">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, mean household income|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>

{{cquote|
"[[Median]] income is the amount which divides the [[income distribution]] into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount. [[Mean]] income ([[average]]) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group. The means and medians for households and families are based on all households and families. Means and medians for people are based on people 15 years old and over with income."<ref name="US Government, the different between mean and median">{{cite web|url=http://www.business.gov/topics/research_resources/market_research/census_bureau_faq.html|title=US Government, the different between mean and median|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref><br>-US Census Bureau, Frequently Asked Question, published by First Gov.
