'''''The Last Dangerous Visions''''' was planned to be a sequel to the [[science fiction]] [[short story]] [[anthology|anthologies]] ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' and ''[[Again, Dangerous Visions]]''.  It was edited by [[Harlan Ellison]]. 

Various difficulties, however, delayed publication many times.  At this point, Ellison has said that it will probably never see the light of day, since by now the stories wouldn't be as groundbreaking or have the impact they would have had in the [[1970s]].  Ellison has been severely criticized for neither publishing the volume nor returning control of the stories to their authors, some of whom have since died.

One story destined for ''Last Dangerous Visions'', "Himself in Anachron" by [[Cordwainer Smith]] (died 1966), did find publication in the [[1993]] collection of Smith's short fiction, ''The Rediscovery of Man''. Other stories that have since been published are [[John Varley (author)|John Varley's]] "The Bellman", which was published in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' magazine in [[2003]], and [[Joe Haldeman]]'s "Fantasy for Six Electrodes and One Adrenaline Drip", which Haldeman had believed lost until finding an old carbon copy of the manuscript and which was finally published in his [[2006]] collection ''A Separate War and Other Stories''. 

In 2005 Haffner Press published a large reprint collection of [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s two "Star Kings" novels and [[Leigh Brackett]]'s three stories starring Eric Stark, called ''Stark and the Star Kings''. The title story is the long-lost tale by both writers which should have been published in ''Last Dangerous Visions''.

[[United Kingdom|British]] author [[Christopher Priest (science fiction writer)|Christopher Priest]]'s lengthy critique of Ellison's failure to publish was published as "The Last Deadloss Visions" in the UK and, in book form, as ''The Book on the Edge of Forever'' (an allusion to the Ellison-written ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode ''[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]'') by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in the US.  The essay was once available online, but Priest has since requested the essay be withdrawn from the [[Internet]].
