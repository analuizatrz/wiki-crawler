'''Hurricane Karen''' was the eleventh [[tropical cyclone|named storm]] and fourth hurricane of the [[2007 Atlantic hurricane season]].<ref name="reuters">{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/featuredCrisis/idUSN26286071|title=Tropical Storm Karen nears hurricane strength|accessdate=2007-12-30|date=2007-09-26|publisher=Reuters}}</ref> Karen was a [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] that developed in the eastern tropical [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] out of a large tropical wave. The storm briefly reached [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] hurricane intensity before slowly weakening due to increased [[wind shear]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Karen 2007 track.png}}
The system began as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of [[Africa]] on September 21. The wave was not well-organized with only scattered [[thunderstorm]] activity and large area of [[low pressure area|low pressure]]. As the system tracked westward south of [[Cape Verde]], deep convection gradually increased, curved banding features became defined, and a poorly-defined circulation became evident. Early on September 23, [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classification]] estimates were introduced. Little change in organization took place until the evening of September 24. That evening, the low-level circulation and banding features became better defined as the system tracked west-northwest. Late that evening, the system was declared [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|Tropical Depression]] Twelve while west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.<ref name="karentcr">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Report for Hurricane Karen|accessdate=2007-11-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122007_Karen.pdf}}</ref>

The tropical depression quickly intensified into early on September 25 as the system continued to organize, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karen that morning.<ref name="12LDisc2">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.002.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #2|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Beven|date=2007-09-25|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> The strengthening trend was temporarily halted, and Karen remained a weak tropical storm with relatively shallow convection. Late that evening, new bursts of deep convection developed with the storm.<ref name="12LDisc5">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.005.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #5|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Brown|date=2007-09-25|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> Early on September 26, Karen intensified significantly and an inner core began to develop.<ref name="12LDisc6">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.006.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #6|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Brown|date=2007-09-26|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> That morning, a ragged [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed and the system strengthened into a hurricane with 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) winds.<ref name="karentcr"/> The intensification trend was short-lived, and the storm leveled off that afternoon as upper-level [[wind shear]] increased substantially due to the presence of a nearby [[Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough|tropical upper tropospheric trough]].<ref name="12LDisc8">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.008.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #8|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Landsea/Pasch|date=2007-09-26|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> The storm became less organized that evening. Hurricane Karen weakened to a tropical storm as flight data from [[NOAA]] [[Hurricane Hunters]] confirmed surface winds of 72&nbsp;mph (115&nbsp;km/h) and a very large wind field late that evening.<ref name="12LDisc9">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.009.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #9|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Blake|date=2007-09-26|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> Operationally, Karen was classified as a strong tropical storm, but was reclassified as a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane based on data from the [[reconnaissance]] flight late on September 26&nbsp;and the less organized structure of the storm at that time.<ref name="karentcr"/>

A slow weakening trend began early on September 27 due to the increased shear while remaining on a west-northwest track.<ref name="12LDisc10">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.010.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #10|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Mainelli|date=2007-09-27|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> At the same time, the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear. As a result, an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well to the east and to the northwest of the center.<ref name="12LDisc11">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.011.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #11|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Roberts/Avila|date=2007-09-27|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> The weakening trend remained fairly slow that evening as the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection.<ref name="12LDisc13">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.013.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #13|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Blake|date=2007-09-27|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> The weakening trend accelerated on September 28 as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high-shear environment.<ref name="12LDisc14">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.014.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #14|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Mainelli|date=2007-09-28|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> By that morning, Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) winds.<ref name="12LDisc15">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.015.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #15|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Roberts|date=2007-09-28|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> Karen also turned abruptly to the north for a short while, as convection interacted with the low-level center and southerly winds increased in the low-level environment.<ref name="karentcr"/> The weakening trend slowed that afternoon as deep convection returned to the disorganized storm.<ref name="12LDisc16">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.016.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Karen Discussion #16|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Roberts|date=2007-09-28|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> Early on September 29, the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly-defined center.<ref name="karentcr"/><ref name="12LDisc19">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.discus.019.shtml?|title=Tropical Depression Karen Discussion #19|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Avila|date=2007-09-29|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> That afternoon, the circulation dissipated while east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation.<ref name="karentcr"/>

==Impact==
The [[National Hurricane Center]] briefly assessed a minimal threat to the [[Lesser Antilles]], with one forecaster noting a 5% probability for the cyclone to produce tropical storm winds on [[Barbuda]].<ref name="karen14">{{cite web|author=Mainelli|year=2007|title=Tropical Storm Karen Wind Speed Probabilities Number 14|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-11-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al12/al122007.wndprb.014.shtml?}}</ref> However, Karen stayed in the open Atlantic Ocean and never affected any land area. No incidents of damage or casualties were reported.<ref name="karentcr"/> No [[ship]] reports of tropical storm-force or stronger were received.<ref name="karentcr"/> Some of the [[vorticity]] from Karen's remnants may have been responsible for the development of the short-lived [[List of storms in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Depression Fifteen|Tropical Depression Fifteen]] on October 11.<ref name="15LDisc1">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al15/al152007.discus.001.shtml?|title=Tropical Depression Fifteen Discussion #1|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Franklin|date=2007-10-11|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref>

Due to lack of any significant effects from Hurricane Karen, the name Karen was not retired and is included on the list of names for the [[2013 Atlantic hurricane season]].
