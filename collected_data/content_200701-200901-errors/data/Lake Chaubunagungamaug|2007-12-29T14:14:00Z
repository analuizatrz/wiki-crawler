'''Lake Chaubunagungamaug''' ({{pronEng|tʃəˌbʌnəˈɡʌŋɡəmɑːɡ}}), also known as "'''Webster Lake'''", is a [[lake]] in the [[New England town|town]] of [[Webster, Massachusetts]].  It is located near the [[Connecticut]] border and has a surface area of 1,442 acres (5.83 km²).

'''Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg''' 
({{IPA|/ˌleɪk tʃəˈɡɑːɡəɡɑːɡ ˌmænˈtʃɑːɡəɡɑːɡ tʃəˌbʌnəˈɡʌŋɡəmɑːɡ/}}[http://www.nytimes.com/audiopages/2004/11/19/national/20041120_LAKE_AUDIO.html][http://www.oldewebster.com/home_archive.htm]), 
a 45-letter alternative name for this body of water, is often cited as the longest [[place name]] in the [[United States]] and one of the longest in the world.  Today, "Webster Lake" may be the name most used, but some (including many residents of Webster), take pride in reeling off the official version.<ref name="miller">{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Jeff |date=[[1 April]] [[2006]] |url=http://members.aol.com/gulfhigh2/words10.html |title=A Collection of Word Oddities and Trivia |accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref>

==The name==
This lake has several alternative names, but Lake Chaubunagungamaug is the official name of the lake as recognized by the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]].<ref>{{Gnis|619290}}</ref> Nonetheless, many area residents, as well as the town of Webster's official Website, prefer the longer version.<ref>[http://webster-ma.gov/ Town of Webster], accessed [[January 15]], [[2007]].</ref>

The name comes from the language of the local [[Nipmuck]] people and means something close to "[[fishing]] place at the [[Border|boundary]]".  The lake was an important fishing spot on the borders of several tribal [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]] and lay at the nexus of many local paths of the [[Great Trail]] system.  For these reasons the lake was often used as a meeting place.

[[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking peoples had several different names for the lake as recorded on old maps and historical records. However, all of these were similar in part and had almost the same translation.  Among other early names were "Chabanaguncamogue" and "Chaubanagogum".<ref name="oldewebster">[http://www.oldewebster.com/history/lake_chargogg.htm Old Webster History]</ref>

A map of [[1795]], showing the town of [[Dudley, Massachusetts|Dudley]], indicated the name as "Chargoggaggoggmanchoggagogg". A survey of the lake done in [[1830]] lists the name as Chaubunagungamaugg, the older name.  The following year, both Dudley and [[Oxford, Massachusetts|Oxford]], which adjoined the lake, filed maps listing the name as "Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg".<ref name="oldewebster"/>

Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg, the extra-long version of the name, is the longest place name in the [[United States]] and 6th longest in the world. Its 15 uses of "g" are the most instances of any letter in a word.  The name also contains 9 instances of the letter "a" (not including the "a" in "lake"), more than any word in the English language.<ref name="miller"/>

This longest name means approximately "[[Englishmen]] at Manchaug territory at the meeting and fishing place at the boundary" and was applied in the 19th century when [[White people]] built factories in the area.  "Manchaug" is derived from the "Monuhchogoks", a group of Nipmuck that lived by the lakeshore.  [[Spelling]] of the long name varies, even on official signs near the lake.  Webster [[school]]s use this long form of the name in various capacities.<ref name="oldewebster"/><ref>[http://www.nativetech.org/Nipmuc/placenames/mainmass.html Nipmuc Place Names of New England]</ref>

Larry Daly, [[Literary editor|editor]] of ''The Webster Times'', wrote a [[humor]]ous article in the [[1920s]] about the lake and the disputes concerning the meaning of its name. He proposed the [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[translation]] "You Fish on Your Side, I Fish on My Side, Nobody Fish in the Middle".  It has met with so much popular acceptance that relatively little attention has been paid to the actual translation.

Two songs about the lake's name have been written.  One was a regional song from the [[1930s]] and the other was recorded by [[Ethel Merman]] and [[Ray Bolger]] and released in [[1954]] by [[Decca Records|Decca]].  The latter incorporates the tale about the lake's name according to Daly.

In the 1950s, a plan to set the official name of the water to Lake Chaubunagungamaug rather than the longer version inspired a [[poem]] of [[doggerel]] verse which concludes:
<blockquote>
"Touch not a g!" No impious hand<br />
Shall wrest one from that noble name<br />
Fifteen in all their glory stand<br />
And ever shall the same.<br />
For never shall that number down,<br />
Tho [[Gog and Magog|Gogg and Magogg]] shout and thunder;<br />
Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg's renown<br />
Shall blaze, the beacon of the town,<br />
While nations gaze and wonder.<ref>[http://www.oldewebster.com/history/evolution.htm Poem by Bertha A. Joslin]</ref></blockquote>

== The lake ==
Lake Chaubunagungamaug was formed by the retreat of [[glacier]]s and is replenished from an underwater [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]].  The area includes three smaller bodies of water joined by narrow channels: North Pond, Middle Pond and South Pond. There are 17 miles of shore line. The length of the Lake is 3.25 miles, and at its widest point in Middle Pond, the distance is 1.125 miles. The shore line of North Pond is 5.78 miles, of Middle Pond, 7.06 miles, and South Pond is 4.17 miles.<ref name="oldewebster"/><ref name="landscape">[http://www.websterlakeassociation.com/Environmental%20Issues/Landsscape%20Planning%20Study%20of%20Webster%20Ma%20by%20U%20Mass.pdf Landscape Planning Study]</ref>

These waters attracted [[Samuel Slater]] to the area; along with [[Slater Mill]] and other local sites, the [[milldam]]s and associated factories near this lake marked the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the [[New World]].  The "Englishmen at Manchaug,"  reference dates from this time.  Now where the lake connects to an inlet of the [[French River (Massachusetts)|French River]] there is a source of [[hydroelectric power]].<ref name="oldewebster"/><ref name="landscape"/>

Lake Chaubunagungamaug stands at the approximate halfway point between the [[city|cities]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]].  [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]] passes along the north shore of the lake near the route's intersection with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut)|I-395]].  The lake is a center for recreational activity in this part of [[New England]] and attracts people for [[boating]], [[swimming]] and [[fishing]].  In warm weather, the 11-acre ''Memorial Beach'' is a popular destination.  In the winter, the lake attracts [[skating|skaters]] and [[icefishing|icefishers]].<ref name="landscape"/>
