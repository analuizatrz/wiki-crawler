'''Aquilla Lake''' is an artificial [[lake]] ([[reservoir]]) in [[Hill County, Texas]], USA. The dam was constructed by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. The dam is part of the overall [[flood]] control project in the [[Brazos River]] basin. The lake is located approximately {{convert|23|mi|km|0}} north of [[Waco, Texas]].

The dam was built and is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The lake is formed by an earthfill dam with a crest length of {{convert|11890|ft|m|0}} and a top width of {{convert|38|ft|m|1}}. A reinforced concrete inlet structure near the center of dam houses the flood-control gates and operating equipment. Closure of the dam began March 20, 1982, and the dam was completed in January 1983. Deliberate impoundment began April 29, 1983. The lake was built for water supply, flood control, and recreation purposes. Figures given herein represent total contents. Data regarding the dam and lake are given in the following table (USGS data):
