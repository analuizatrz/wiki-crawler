'''Marmais''' ([[lang|Bulgarian]]: Мармаис), d.924 was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] military commander, noble and ''komita'' (duke) of a western Bulgarian region ([[Sredets]] or [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]) during the reign of Emperor [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] (893-927). He was a descendant of an ancient Bulgarian family. He participated actively in the [[Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars]] but he is better known for his interference and campaigns against the [[Serb]] principality of [[Raška]].

In [[917]] the Serb prince Petar Gojniković, who was an ally of the Bulgarian Emperor openly changed sides and supported the [[Byzantines]]. This danger from the rare played a significant role for the delay of the advance towards [[Constantinople]] after the striking victory at [[battle of Anchialus|Anchialus]]. In the fall of that year Simeon sent a punitive expedition force against the Serbs, led by [[Theodore Sigritsa]] and Marmais. They convinced Petar Gojniković to meet them, captured him and sent him to [[Preslav]]. They pointed Peter's cousin Pavle Branović for the next ruler of Raška but three years later he also betrayed his alliance with [[Bulgaria]]. Marmais changed him with Zaharije Pribisavljević but he also started hostile actions against Bulgaria in [[924]]. Marmais and Sigritsa lead a small army against him but they were ambushed and defeated, and their heads were later sent to the Byzantines. 

The death of Marmais caused a major campaign against the Serb principality which was totally defeated and turned into Bulgarian province in the same [[924]].
