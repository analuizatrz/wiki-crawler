[[Image:sg1stargatefront.jpg|thumb|300px|An activated [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]], the central object of the fictional Stargate universe, here depicted in the ''[[Stargate SG-1|SG-1]]'' television series.]]
'''Stargate''' refers to the [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] owned by [[MGM]] that began in early 1994 with the [[feature film]] ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. The subsequent body of works detail an elaborate [[fictional universe]] where [[Earth]] defends from [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien races]] possessing far superior technology. The film's story is continued in three [[live-action]] [[television series]] (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Stargate Universe]]''), an [[cartoon|animated]] series (''[[Stargate Infinity]]''), [[video game]]s (such as ''[[Stargate Worlds]]''), [[Stargate literature|novel]]s, comics, and other derivative works.

==Premise==
Stargate productions centre on the premise of a "[[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]", a ring-shaped alien device that creates a [[wormhole]] enabling personal [[teleportation]] to complementary devices located cosmic distances away.<ref name="SG1 Official">{{cite web|url=http://www.stargatesg-1.com|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Official Site}} ''FAQ Section''</ref> Under the control of the United States government, the Stargate discovered on Earth is kept a secret from the public. This allows storylines to present [[suspension of disbelief|no contradiction]] between depicted events and [[reality]],<ref name="wright02">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/articles/interviews/wright02.shtml|title=Interview with Brad Wright|work=GateWorld}}</ref> an effect compounded by setting ''Stargate'' in the [[present day]], and depicting Earth accurately, with any unrealistic technology originating solely from alien civilizations.<ref name="stargate summary">{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=132284|title=Summary of ''Stargate''|work=New York Times}}</ref> These extraterrestrial civilizations are however more often [[Industrialisation|pre-industrial]] than [[science|scientifically advanced]], and are almost invariably [[human]]. Together, this allows for stories predominated by human interaction in Earth-like environments, an unusual feature for a science fiction franchise.

In the story, this is explained as being the result of alien interference in Earth's distant past. Many ancient [[mythology|mythologies]] are shown to be the result of aliens who had visited Earth posing as [[polytheism|gods]]<ref name="primer">{{cite web | url=http://www.gateworld.net/articles/features/primer/index.shtml | title=Stargate Primer | work=GateWorld}}</ref> by using their technology to give the impression of deific power.<ref name="mythology">{{cite web | url=http://www.stargatefan.com/references/mythology/index.html | title = Mythological References in ''Stargate SG-1''|work=StargateFan}}</ref> While some of these aliens had benign intentions, a race later known in ''Stargate SG-1'' as the "[[Goa'uld]]" used Stargates to move slaves from [[Ancient Egypt]] to other habitable planets, simultaneously being responsible for the Egyptian [[religion]] and [[culture]]. Following a successful rebellion, they fled Earth, and the Stargate was buried and forgotten until modern times, when the United States acquired it following an archaeological dig. Rediscovering the function of the Stargate, the galaxy is begotten as a source of knowledge, as well as threats, and the attention of the Goa'uld is drawn once more to Earth.

==Canonicity==
Due to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various Stargate productions are not entirely consistent with each other; and while no set of works forms an official [[canon (fiction)|canon]],<ref name="GateWorld Brad Wright Interview">{{cite interview|last=Wright|first=Brad|subjectlink=Brad Wright|interviewer=Darren Sumner|program= [[GateWorld]]|city=[[Chicago]]|date=July 2002}}</ref> the largest [[fanbase|following]] exists for the three live-action series.<ref name="GateWorld Omnipedia FAQ 5">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/faq.shtml#5|title=GateWorld Omnipedia FAQ}}: FAQ #5 summarises canonicity</ref>

Through the work of various authors and developers, at least six separate story cycles can be discerned, some of which are continuations of the other ones (either endorsed or unendorsed by their ancestor). The list below summarises these interlocking canons:

<ol>
<li>
; Original Film         : Developed by [[Dean Devlin]] and directed by [[Roland Emmerich]], the rights are owned by [[Lionsgate]].
;* ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' (1994)
</li>
<li>
; Novel Film Sequels    : [[Bill McCay]] published a series of novels to follow the original film. These were inspired by Devlin and Emmerich's notes, and thus attempt not only to be consistent with the original film, but predict how it would have developed. The books are not endorsed by either Devlin, Emmerich or MGM.
</li>
<li>
; Bridge Studios        : MGM's rights over the franchise that Devlin began allowed it to create a television series to follow the original film. This was developed by [[Brad Wright]] and [[Jonathan Glassner]], without the endorsement of Dean Devlin. Filming and development took place at [[Bridge Studios]] in Canada. Further developments of this canon involved developer [[Robert C. Cooper]].
;* [[Stargate SG-1]] (1997)
;* [[Stargate Atlantis]] (2004)
;* [[Stargate Universe]] (2009)
</li>
<li>
; Infinity              : MGM co-produced an animated television series with [[DiC Entertainment]], as a spin-off from ''Stargate SG-1''. This was not intended to be endorsed by the Bridge Studios canon.
;* [[Stargate Infinity]] (2002)
</li>
<li>
; Bridge Studios Fandom : Various comics and short stories have been published from several sources that are intended to be consistent with and follow on from the Bridge Studios canon. These are not endorsed by the Bridge Studios developers, but have the blessing of MGM.
</li>
<li>
; Worlds                : MGM licensed the franchise to [[Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment]] to produce an [[MMORPG]] based on the Stargate universe. Their work intends to be consistent with the Bridge Studios canon, and has been endorsed by Brad Wright who claims it will be as canon as the series.
;* [[Stargate Worlds]] (TBC)

In 1994, the [[science fiction]]/[[action film|action]] [[feature film]] ''Stargate'' was released, directed by [[Roland Emmerich]] and co-written by [[Dean Devlin]]. This marked the beginning of the Stargate franchise. Originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films,<ref name="Originally Trilogy">{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/devlin-potential-stargate-trilogy_article_35086.html|title=Mania.Com ''Cinescape Exclusive''}} ''Devlin on potential Stargate trilogy''.</ref> creators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin ultimately moved on to produce ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'', and it was not until 2006 that Devlin showed renewed interest in developing sequels.<ref name="Devlin on Sequels">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537|title=ComingSoon.Net}} ''Devlin Announces Plans for Stargate Sequels'' ([[2006-07-20]]).</ref> In the intervening time, as [[MGM]] owned the rights to the franchise, the [[television series]] ''Stargate SG-1'' succeeded the film without the input of Emmerich and Devlin.

The film lays the foundation for all the Stargate productions that come after it, by explaining the notion, function and history of the Stargate. The opening scenes of the film depict the unearthing of the Stargate at [[Giza]] in 1928, being the effective beginning of the entire Stargate story. Later in the [[Present Day]] (i.e. 1994), the main character [[Daniel Jackson]] is introduced as a failing [[egyptologist]] who is defending outlandish theories about the builders of the [[Pyramids of Giza|Pyramids]], alluding to a [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|non-human]] origin. His theories are noticed by the [[U.S. Air Force]], who hire him to help decipher the [[hieroglyphs]] present on the [[cover stone]]s that were found with the Giza Stargate, now housed at a military base.

Jackson manages to correctly translate the name "Stargate" from the stones, and furthermore discovers that the symbols depicted on the inner ring of the Stargate correspond to [[constellations]]. These symbols are found in groups of seven on [[cartouche]]s, causing Jackson to theorise that the first six constellations mark six points in space that can be used to extrapolate a singular new location, and a seventh to mark the current location ("point of origin"), thereby describing an [[interstellar]] journey. At this point he is shown the Stargate itself, which, when powered, can be operated so that up to seven of the symbols on its ring "lock" into place. Before Jackson's revelation, only six had ever been successfully "locked". Jackson is able to identify the seventh and final constellation marking the point of origin (i.e. Earth), and the Stargate opens.

A watery vortex forms inside the inner ring. A probe is pushed through, and its position is tracked on a screen; it is shown to be travelling to a distant galaxy outside known part of the universe, finally stopping a cosmic distance away. Footage sent back from the probe reveals a habitable atmosphere inside what appears to be a temple on [[Abydos (Stargate)|another planet]]. Colonel [[Jack O'Neill|Jack O'Neil]] is ordered to take a team through the Stargate to identify if there are any military threats on the other side. If so, he is to destroy the Stargate at the destination with a [[nuclear bomb]], making it impossible for those threats to travel backwards through the gate to Earth. As the Stargate works only in one direction at a time, Daniel Jackson is incorporated into Jack O'Neil's team so that he can decipher the cartouche they hope to find on the other end, thereupon allowing the team to return home.

On the other side, O'Neil's team discovers a [[slave]] civilization serving an [[Ra (Stargate)|alien]] who is posing as the Egyptian god [[Ra]]. He and his minion-gods take human form, commanding the slaves with [[tyranny|brute force]] from a [[Ha'tak|mothership]] that uses a Pyramid as a landing-pad (confirming Daniel Jackson's theories), and several smaller [[Death Glider|attack ships]]. The team befriend these people, and Jackson is even unwittingly married to a local [[Sha're|woman]]. However, the team is ultimately captured by Ra's forces, who also take possession of O'Neil's nuclear weapon, which Ra intends to send back to Earth through the Stargate with an enhanced [[warhead]] increasing its destructive power a hundredfold. After much struggle, O'Neil's team are able to instigate a [[slave rebellion]], overwhelming Ra's forces and causing Ra to escape in his mothership. Unable to disarm the warhead, O'Neil is able to instead [[teleport]] it on-board Ra's ship, where it detonates in orbit. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with the wife he has fallen in love with.

===Other films===
After Bill McCay had written a [[Stargate film novels|series of five novels]] continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite the success of the ''Stargate'' television series, Dean Devlin stated in 2006 that "he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original" <ref>http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=37194&type=0</ref> and that the McCay books were not correct.<ref>[http://gateworld.net/news/2006/07/devlin_optimistic_about_stargate.shtml GateWorld - Devlin optimistic about 'Stargate' sequels]</ref> According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader.

[[Image:Sg1-poster.jpg|thumb|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.]]
{{main|Stargate SG-1}}

In 1997, [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]] co-developed ''Stargate SG-1'', a [[television series]] intended to continue the story laid down by the original film. Although new actors were cast, several roles from the film were reprised, including the main characters Daniel Jackson and Jack O'Neill (which was re-spelled to include an extra "L"). The [[Stargate Command]] setting was transferred from a fictional military facility located in Creek Mountain, to the [[Cheyenne Mountain]] military complex. Other variations and differences between the original film and ''SG-1'' mostly concern the location of the planet [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]], the alien [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]], the race of Ra's underlings ([[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]]), and Stargate travel.<ref name=nytimes >{{cite web |title=Through a Gate to the Far Side of the Universe: A TV Series |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5D7163AF935A15754C0A961958260 |publisher=New York Times |date=[[July 26]], [[1997]] |accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref><ref name=bbc.co.uk>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A765597 BBC.co.uk: BBC - h2g2 - Stargate SG-1 - TV show]</ref>

The series debuted on [[Showtime]] on July 27, 1997, and moved to the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] after its fifth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-08/14/12.30.sfc|title=Announcement from SciFi Channel|work=SciFi Wire}}</ref> It starred [[Richard Dean Anderson]] (as [[Jack O'Neill|O'Neill]]) and [[Michael Shanks]] (as [[Daniel Jackson|Jackson]]), alongside [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Christopher Judge]] and [[Don S. Davis]] playing the new characters [[Samantha Carter]], [[Teal'c]] and [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]]. The cast remained fairly regular for most of ''SG-1'''s run, but experienced some changes. [[Michael Shanks]] left the show at the end of Season 5 and was replaced by [[Corin Nemec]] as [[Jonas Quinn]].  Shanks returned at the beginning of Season 7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season 7 [[Don S. Davis|Davis]] left the show and [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]] filled the gap he left in the story. Season 9 saw the departure of [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]], but added new regulars [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Ben Browder]]. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, [[Claudia Black]]'s popular reception<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/claudia_black_01.htm|title=Interview &mdash; Vala joins ''SG-1'' regulars|work=SciFi World}}</ref> earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.

[[MGM]] put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regards it as one of its most important franchises.<ref name="Stargate 200">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6332083.html|title=''Stargate 200'': 10 years of ''Stargate'' success|work=MultiChannel}}</ref> It has won the [[Saturn Award]] for ''Best Syndicated Television Series'' on numerous occasions, and its cast has won similar awards for acting.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118480/awards|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Awards and Nominations|work=IMDb}}</ref> More recently it has received acclaim for its [[visual effect]]s, which increased in quality and realism as the show gained a larger budget.<ref name="vfx">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/05/istargatei_grew_cutting_edge_vfx.shtml|title=Stargate  grows cutting edge VFX industry|work=GateWorld}}</ref>

The series begins one year after the original film in its internal chronology. It chronicles the activities of [[SG-1]], the first exploratory team of the newly-formed [[Stargate Command]], after an enemy attack through the Stargate alerts the [[United States Air Force]] that Ra was not the last of [[Goa'uld|his species]] (contrary to the film).

''Stargate SG-1'' proved to be very popular. Each year from Seasons 5 to 8 the show was repeatedly expected to end, but ratings continued to be high, allowing the show to break records and enter its tenth and final season (surpassing ''[[The X-Files]]'' as the longest running United States science-fiction series). ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' recognized Stargate SG-1 as the longest currently running consecutive sci-fi series in 2006. The show is second only to the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' series, which holds the title for longest running sci-fi show overall.

On August 21, 2006, the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] announced that it would not be renewing ''Stargate SG-1'' for an eleventh season after a series of poor performances in the [[Nielsen Ratings]].<ref name="sg1 cancellation">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6364450.html?display=Breaking+News|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Said To Be Axed|work=MultiChannel News}}</ref> Many fans were enraged at the news, even creating reactionary websites to exhibit their commitment to the series.<ref name="savestargatesg1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/fans_rally_savestargatesg1.com.shtml|title=Fans Rally: SaveStargateSG1|work=GateWorld}}</ref> Spokesmen for the production have said all options for the continuation of ''SG-1'' are being considered, including complete digital broadcasting.<ref name="sg1 future">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6366152.html|title=MGM Insists ''Stargate'' Won't Shut|work=MultiChannel News}}</ref> Executive producer [[Robert C.

===''Stargate Atlantis''===

{{main|Stargate Atlantis}}
[[Image:Sga poster 1.JPG|thumb|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.]]

''Stargate Atlantis'' began as a [[spin-off]] [[television series]] from ''Stargate SG-1'' but was originally intended to succeed it following a second feature film. The second movie was planned for after the sixth season and, when ''SG-1'' was renewed for another year, for after the seventh season. When ''SG-1'' was renewed again for an eighth season, the intended film became the episode "[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]", a two-part [[season finale]], and the setting of ''Stargate Atlantis'' was moved to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]]. <ref>{{cite book | last = Gosling  | first = Sharon | authorlink = Sharon Gosling | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | origdate =  | origyear = 2005 | origmonth = July | publisher = Titan Books | location = London | isbn = 1-84576-116-2 | pages = 10&ndash;14 | chapter = Watergate }}</ref> This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same [[fictional universe]], and later on the two shows even began to be interconnected. The show is developed by most of the same people as ''SG-1'', and is produced in the same studios.

''Atlantis'' debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 16, 2004, starring [[Joe Flanigan]] and [[Torri Higginson]] in the lead roles, with [[Rainbow Francks|Rainbow Sun Francks]], [[David Hewlett]], and [[Rachel Luttrell]] alongside. Hewlett and Higginson's characters had previously appeared in ''SG-1'' (though Higginson inherited the role from actress [[Jessica Steen]]). In ''Atlantis''' second season, [[Paul McGillion]] and [[Jason Momoa]] (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season 4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and [[Jewel Staite]] in a recurring role. The series' 5th season has recently begun airing on the Sci Fi Channel. Amanda Tapping left the show to concentrate on her other show [[Sanctuary (web series)|Sanctuary]]. [[Robert Picardo]] replaced her, reprising his role as [[Richard Woolsey]] from both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.On August 21, 2008 its been reported by tv.com that Stargate Atlantis is coming to end . The SCI FI Channel have decided to end the spinoff series of Stargate SG-1 at the conclusion of its current  fifth season in January.

The plot follows the adventures of the "Atlantis expedition", a combination of military forces and civilian scientists that travel to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]] in search of the Lost City of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], left behind by the most powerful race known to ever have lived, referred to as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] or for the ones living on Atlantis, Lanteans. The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of ''SG-1'''s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the ''SG-1'' setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discover that the Pegasus galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as "the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]" whom they must defend themselves against despite being vastly outnumbered.

The series has won several awards for its actors, visual effects and directors, including a [[WorldFest]] Platinum Award for [[David Winning]]'s direction of an early Season 1 episode. ''Atlantis'' proved to be equally as successful as ''SG-1'', with [[Nielsen Ratings]] consistently in the regions of 1.9.

===''Stargate Universe''===

{{main|Stargate Universe}}
[[Image:SGUlogofilm2.png|thumb|The current logo for ''[[Stargate Universe]]''.]]

''Stargate Universe'' is the working title for a third Stargate series which is currently in development. The idea of Stargate Universe is that it is set on a ship that was part of an Ancient experiment that was set in motion probably millions of years ago, one that they never saw to fruition, but that we can. The experiment is to send a ship across the universe, and to send one ahead of it to seed the galaxies with Stargates, and that they would one day use the stargate's ninth chevron to gate to the ship.

Millions of years ago (before their conflict with the Wraith and even before they moved Atlantis to the Pegasus Galaxy), the show would reveal, the Ancients sent out two ships: an automated vessel to place Stargates throughout multiple galaxies in our universe, and a second ship to follow up and explore. A standard, 7-symbol gate address allows for travel within the same galaxy. Use of the Stargate's eighth chevron allows for travel to a different galaxy. And the ninth chevron will allow the team to reach this second Ancient ship, the Destiny<ref name="gateworld.net">http://gateworld.net/news/2008/08/istargate_universei_has_a_go.shtml</ref>.

The series was pitched to SCI FI Channel in the fall of 2007, just before the writer's strike -- which put a hold on the project. "The pitch was received very well," according to Stargate Atlantis co-creator Brad Wright. The third Stargate series won't be set on Earth, or on a remote base, but on a ship that travels from galaxy to galaxy.

Following news of the cancellation of ''Atlantis'', it was reported that SciFi Channel had ordered ''Universe'' to series, with a planned launch date of 2009.<ref>[http://www.thrfeed.com/2008/08/stargate-univer.html The Live Feed; Sci Fi orders 'Stargate' spin-off]</ref> It has also been revealed that the series will be geared towards a younger audience.<ref name="gateworld.net"/>

===''Stargate Infinity''===

{{main|Stargate Infinity}}
[[Image:Stargate-infinity.jpg|thumb|''[[Stargate Infinity]].'']]

''Stargate Infinity'' was an [[animated series]] spin-off from ''Stargate SG-1'' intended for children aged 9 to 11. It ran from September 14, 2002 to June 2003 on the [[FOX]] Network. Even though the series was produced by [[MGM]] with [[DiC Entertainment]], none of the writers and producers of ''Stargate SG-1'' were involved with ''Infinity'', and it is not considered official Stargate [[canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/articles/interviews/wright01.shtml GateWorld &mdash; Interviews: Brad Wright]</ref> The show was canceled after one season for its poor reception and ratings.

Set 30 to 40 years in the future, ''Infinity'' tells the story of a team of young recruits led by a veteran member of [[Stargate Command]] that are framed for a crime they did not commit. The team must travel from world to world trying to find a way to clear their name, while protecting a strange alien being discovered in the first episode, which is believed to hold the secret to mysteries surrounding the Stargates and the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] race that built them. Due to its cancellation, none of the major [[plot arc]]s of the series were concluded.

The series featured a strong [[moral]] and [[edutainment|educational]] theme, purposely summarizing each episode with a distinct lesson for its young audience to learn. It focused primarily on the importance of [[teamwork|working together]] and accepting [[xenophobia|differences]] in other cultures or people, whether they be aliens or members of one's own team.

===Children Of The Gods - Final Cut===

Executive producer [[Brad Wright]] has revealed that "Children Of The Gods," [[Stargate SG-1]]'s pilot episode is being re-cut into a [[Stargate SG-1]] direct to [[DVD]] [[movie]] with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version. The [[DVD]] will likely be available some time in [[2009]].

===Third Stargate SG-1 Feature===

Executive producer Brad Wright has revealed that a third film, centric to Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), is in the works and is waiting for the official green-light by MGM to begin production. Filming is expected to begin in 2009 during a similar time to the filming of the upcoming Atlantis movie. However, according to Amanda Tapping, the third post Stargate SG-1 direct-to-DVD film will most likely be released in 2010 instead of 2009.

===Stargate Atlantis Film===

According to Sci-Fi and Joseph Mallozzi, the Stargate Atlantis season 5 finale 'Enemy at the Gate' will air on January 9, 2009. A two hour direct-to-DVD movie has been given the go ahead with a release date sometime during July 2009. More movies are expected to follow in the Atlantis series if the first movie is successful.

==Books==

{{main|Stargate literature}}

There are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' film and two based in the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' [[television show]]s. Short fiction has also been published in the official ''Stargate Magazine''.

A series of books written by [[Bill McCay]] were published from 1996 to 1999 that were unofficial sequels to the film. These were produced by consulting the original notes made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, in an attempt to envision where the film "would have gone". Neither party has commented on whether McCay's interpretation was correct. Despite the fact that he attempted to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series ''Stargate SG-1'' (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making  no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.

Later,  from 1999 to 2001, [[ROC (publisher)|ROC]] published four novels based in ''Stargate SG-1'' written by [[Ashley McConnell]]. In 2004, UK-based [[Fandemonium|Fandemonium Press]] started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on ''Stargate SG-1''. Due to the conflict with ROC's license, these books were available in  Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK, but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006.

The official ''Stargate Magazine'', produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.

===Comics===

{{main|Stargate Comics}}

A series of [[comic book]]s, based on ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'', began to be published by [[Avatar Press]] in 2003. Five have been published to date, with stories by [[James Anthony]] and artwork by [[Jorge Correa]].
{{-}}

===Audio books===

{{main|Stargate audiobooks}}

In February 2008 it was announced that [[Big Finish Productions]] would be releasing officially-licensed [[audiobooks]] featuring members of the cast reading new stories. The first two stories, available on CD and digital download, are ''[[Gift of the Gods]]'' read by [[Michael Shanks]] and ''[[A Necessary Evil (Stargate audio)|A Necessary Evil]]'' read by [[Torri Higginson]].

==Future productions==
Charles Cohen, executive vice president of MGM Television, has voiced plans to develop further Stargate films and produce a third television series to be titled ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' (discounting ''Infinity'' as a Stargate television series), currently in a pre-production concept phase.<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/05/mgm_planning_stargate_film_third.shtml MGM planning Stargate film, third series]. ''Gateworld.net''</ref><ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/12/exclusive_third_istargatei_serie.shtml Exclusive: Third Stargate series in development]. ''Gateworld.net''</ref> 

Plans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film's creator [[Dean Devlin]] at the 2006 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. He has said he is currently in talks with MGM to produce four films and he would like two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy.<ref name="film_sequels">[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 Devlin Announces Plans for Stargate Sequels]</ref> In an interview with [[Sci Fi Wire]], Devlin says that should the sequels be made, he hopes to enlist [[Kurt Russell]] and [[James Spader]] in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader have expressed interest, Devlin revealed. "They've always said they wanted to do it. The irony is actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [and] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We were just going to kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely." These sequels would ignore the 12 years of mythology created by ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' if they are produced.<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=37194&type=0 SciFi Wire Interview with Devlin]</ref>

In the meantime, Lionsgate remains the major rights holder to the original film; this was due to the fact that its predecessor, Live Entertainment, owned home video rights to the [[Carolco Pictures]] library and had also owned international distribution rights, although Carolco itself was on the brink of bankruptcy when they produced this film.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

It was announced on 10 January 2008 that a series of original Audio Dramas would be produced by British company [[Big Finish Productions]], who are famous for producing Audio Dramas for other (mostly British) Science Fiction franchises such as [[Doctor Who]], [[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]], and [[The Tomorrow People]]. These have started being made available for purchase via download and also as a CD release. The plays take place in both the existing SG-1 and Altantis continuities, and feature members of the original cast.<ref>[http://www.bigfinish.com/Stargate-SG-1-and-Atlantis Big Finish's Stargate store]</ref>
