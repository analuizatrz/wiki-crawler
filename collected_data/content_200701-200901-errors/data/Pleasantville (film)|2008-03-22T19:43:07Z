'''''Pleasantville''''' is a [[New Line Cinema]] film first released in [[Canada]] on [[September 17]], [[1998 in film|1998]] starring [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[William H. Macy]], [[Joan Allen]], and [[Jeff Daniels (actor)|Jeff Daniels]]. [[Don Knotts]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Marley Shelton]], [[Jane Kaczmarek]] and [[J. T. Walsh]] are also featured.

The film was written, produced, and directed by [[Gary Ross]], who also performed those duties for the more recent film ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'' (2003), which also starred Maguire and Macy. This was [[J.T. Walsh]]'s last film, released after his death. The film was released in the United States on October 23, 1998.

In the film two modern teenagers are transported into the community of Pleasantville, the setting of a black and white 1950s television show. Through their actions, the people of Pleasantville begin to experience strong emotion and consequently, events in town begin to deviate from the accepted norm.

== Plot ==

Although David Wagner ([[Tobey Maguire]]) and his sister Jennifer ([[Reese Witherspoon]]) are twins, they lead dramatically different [[high school]] social lives. Jennifer is concerned mainly with her appearance, relationships and popularity, while David has few friends and cannot even drum up the courage to talk to a girl on whom he has a [[crush]]. He spends most of his spare time on the couch, watching television. Jennifer, on the other hand, is very aggressive (as well as sexually promiscuous) and at the beginning of the film makes a date with Mark Davis, one of the most popular boys in school.

Their mother, [[Jane Kaczmarek]], leaves Jennifer and David alone at home while she heads on vacation with her boyfriend (who is later revealed to be nine years younger than her). The twins begin to fight over the use of the downstairs TV; Jennifer wants to watch an [[MTV]] concert with Mark, while David needs the TV in order to watch a marathon of his favorite show, ''Pleasantville''. 

''Pleasantville'' is a black and white '50s [[sitcom]] (a cross between ''[[Leave It To Beaver]]'' or ''[[Father Knows Best]]''), and David is an expert on every episode. During the fight between David and Jennifer, the remote control breaks and the TV cannot be turned on manually. A mysterious TV repairman ([[Don Knotts]]) shows up uninvited, and quizzes David on ''Pleasantville'' before giving him a strange-looking [[remote control]]. The repairman leaves, and David and Jennifer promptly resume fighting. However, they are somehow transported ''into'' the television, ending up in the Parkers' black and white ''Pleasantville'' living room. David tries to reason with the repairman (who communicates with him through the Parkers' TV set) but succeeds only in chasing him away. David and Jennifer must now pretend they are, respectively, Bud and Mary Sue Parker, two of the main characters in the show. 

Breakfast in the Parker house is served by [[housewife|stay-at-home]] mother Betty Parker ([[Joan Allen]]), and consists of generous servings of [[bacon]], [[eggs]], [[waffle]]s, [[pancake]]s, [[ham]], [[honey]], [[sausage]], and other fatty foods. Jennifer, a '90s girl, is disgusted at the thought of eating so much. On the way to school, the pair watch as a group of firemen rescue a cat out of a tree, and Jennifer meets Skip ([[Paul Walker]]), the captain of the [[basketball]] team and her soon-to-be boyfriend. David tells her that they must stay “in character,” she must make small-talk with her three monochrome friends and not disrupt the lives of the Pleasantville citizens, who do not notice any physical differences between the old Bud and Mary Sue and David and Jennifer.  In order to keep the plot in line, Mary Sue agrees to go on a date with Skip, although the two have very different ideas of what a date constitutes.

The date between Skip and Mary Sue turns out to be the first catalyst for change in the town, Skip having no knowledge of [[sexual activity|sex]] until Mary Sue introduces him to it. The plot is further thrown out of sequence when Bud’s boss Mr. Johnson ([[Jeff Daniels]]), who runs the [[soda shop]], becomes dissatisfied with his boring, mundane life. Bud initially attempts to convince him to carry on, saying that even if Mr. Johnson does not like his job, he should still do it anyway, but David soon realizes his error and gives Mr. Johnson an [[art]] book, encouraging his true passion. 

Meanwhile, Skip tells the other boys about sex, and soon the teenagers begin to experiment, leading to a sort of [[sexual revolution]]. Betty is curious (leading to a reversal of the sex talk between her and Mary Sue/Jennifer) and, knowing that her husband George (William H. Macy) would never do any of the things Mary Sue describes, engages in [[masturbation]] while bathing. This causes a nearby tree to spontaneously combust. 

Bud, realizing the firemen have no other duties other than to fetch cats out of trees, teaches them how to put out fires and is awarded a medal. He also gets attention from a beautiful cheerleader named Margaret ([[Marley Shelton]]), who bakes him [[oatmeal cookie]]s, the same cookies she was supposed to bake for a boy named Whitey ([[David Tom]]). Bud’s act of heroism has inadvertently changed the storyline, but he seizes the moment and asks Margaret out for a date. When the TV repairman returns and confronts him, Bud turns off the TV, relinquishing his ability to go home in the process.

Pleasantville is changing, [[double bed]]s even become available in stores, colored paints available to buy, students flaunt sexual experiences in public and Pleasantville's wives become tired of their household duties and begin to think, causing their husbands to reel in shock at their behavior. The mayor, Big Bob (J.T Walsh) notices these changes and becomes threatened and so, he hires George on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce to help the town. At this point, Betty has become "colored" and is afraid that George will hate her. Bud helps her to conceal the color with monochrome make-up.

People in Pleasantville begin to explore hidden abilities and revel in their new freedoms. Mr. Johnson begins to paint, while Betty finds that housework no longer interests her. The basketball team loses their first game (previously, not only had they never lost, but they had never missed any shots either), while students begin visiting the public library and reading books recommended by Mary Sue and Bud. Ironically, Mary Sue/Jennifer, who has never shown any interest in school, finds she likes reading so much that she rejects Skip in favor of a book by [[D. H. Lawrence]] and gains color. 

Slowly, certain objects begin turning [[multicolor]], including flowers and the faces of people who have experienced bursts of passion or change. The only people who remain unchanged are the [[town fathers]], led by Mayor Big Bob who sees the changes as eating away at the moral values of Pleasantville. They resolve to do something about their increasingly distant wives and the rebellious teenagers. A town meeting is called. Betty leaves George and the kids - she is in love with Mr. Johnson and cannot hide her 'coloured' face anymore. 

The [[Nazi]]s as well as [[racial segregation]] and [[riot]]ing of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement]] reach Pleasantville, touched off by a nude painting of Betty on the window of Mr. Johnson’s [[soda shop]]. The soda shop is destroyed, piles of [[book burning|books are burned]], and anyone who is "colored" is harassed in the streets. Bud earns his color (Mary Sue having already gotten hers by embracing her passion for books) by defending Betty from a gang of thugs led by Whitey.

He transforms from a wimpy loser to a strong leader who advocates resistance to the new "Pleasantville Code of Conduct", a list of rules preventing people from visiting the library and Lovers Lane, playing loud music, or using paint colors other than black, white or gray.

In [[protest]] against the mundane Pleasantville outlook, Bud and Mr. Johnson paint a colorful [[mural]] depicting [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]s "[[I Have a Dream]]" [[speech]] and other changes in their society. For this they are thrown in jail. Bud is visited then by George who wonders what changed Betty, after he reveals he hasn't eaten since he doesn't know how to cook. Bud simply replies that "people change". They are subsequently brought to trial in front of the entire town, in a prejudiced split-up with the monochrome citizens on the ground floor and the "colored" residents residing on an above balcony. 

George earns his color when, in the courtroom, he cries for the loss of his wife after Bud explains the truth about what he actually misses (Betty herself, not the tasks she performs). Mr. Johnson is repentant and tries to haggle with the mayor, but Bud speaks out, finally arousing enough anger and indignation in Big Bob to turn him colored as well.

With this, the entire town becomes emotional, therefore colored, and the people of Pleasantville are finally introduced to the rest of the world.
 
Jennifer chooses to stay in this alternate world, planning to go to college as Mary Sue Parker. David returns using the remote control and finds his mother crying in the kitchen, distraught over her boring life.  She had thought it would be so different.
David says, "It's not ''supposed'' to be anything". 

The movie ends with a shot of Betty and George, reunited; however, when Betty turns to look at her husband, it is Mr. Johnson who appears in his place.

==Cast==
*[[Tobey Maguire]] as '''David'''. David is the protagonist of the film who feels out of place in the 1990s at the beginning of the film and is more at home in the dream world of Pleasantville. After being transported into the world which he idolizes, David begins to realize that the perceived happiness in Pleasantville is not nearly as fulfilling as he hoped it would be. He eventually sees Pleasantville not as the [[utopia]] he once imagined but as a [[dystopia]] as the freedom of choice and expression is severely limited. His transformation happens as he evolves from dreamy outcast to leader of the changes that take place in Pleasantville.
*[[Reese Witherspoon]] as '''Jennifer'''.  Jennifer, David's twin sister, is in many ways the opposite of her brother.  She is initially dismayed upon being transported to Pleasantville with her brother, but her own personality asserts itself, and she sparks the initial changes in the town.  As the story continues, she begins to understand the limitations she has placed on herself in her own life.  Her reading of a D. H. Lawrence novel signified her effort to change herself, and thus, she effected her own transformation.  By the end of the film she decides to stay (for a while) in a place where she has changed and attend college.
*[[William H. Macy]] as '''George Parker'''. George is the stereotypical 1950s working father with cues directly from shows such as ''[[Leave it to Beaver]]'' and ''[[Father Knows Best]]''. He is very change averse and when the town begins to change he does not know how to cope. He remains black and white through nearly the entire film until David tells him how much he really loves his wife.   
*[[Joan Allen]] as '''Betty Parker'''. Betty starts as the typical 1950s stay at home mother but evolves in emotions much more quickly than her husband. This causes conflict starting with her change from black and white to color after Jennifer recommends [[masturbation]]. She initially tries to cover up this affliction but then decides she should not be ashamed. Her love triangle with Bill Johnson also becomes an issue showing that such [[taboo]] events did occur even in 1950s culture.
*[[Jeff Daniels]] as '''Bill Johnson'''. Bill starts the film completely unable to do anything that is not specifically defined in his repetitive list of tasks. This changes however when David inadvertently teaches him a small level of autonomy. This autonomy progresses and Bill begins acting out his desire to be creative and paint. Bill evolves into the central revolutionary in the film going so far as to paint a naked mural on one of his windows. After the town turns fully Technicolor it is revealed in the last shot that George is replaced by him sitting on the bench next to Betty.
*[[Don Knotts]] as the '''TV Repairman'''. Don Knotts plays a small but memorable role as the TV repairman granting David his wish of being part of Pleasantville. While shown to hate the change happening to his town, the repairman is shown with a smile on his face after David turns from aloofness to compassion for his mother.
*[[Jane Kaczmarek]] as '''David's Mom'''. David's Mom plays the [[foil (literature)|foil]] to Betty by never cooking or cleaning, and shattering an hour of curse-less dialogue with "fuck" at the end of the film. David parallels his treatment of Betty by wiping the make-up off her face and consoling her, showing a complete change since the film's start.
*[[J.T. Walsh]] as '''Big Bob'''. Big Bob plays the town's mayor with slight [[Nazi]] undertones. He is the most reactionary in the town and decides that colors are indecent. Many subtle references to ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' are made in the closing court scene with Big Bob playing the lead. Even he turns to color as he expresses fierce anger towards David. Upon seeing his new face he flees the court room in shame leaving the town to its own devices, ultimately freeing it. This was actor J.T. Walsh's final film as he died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] shortly after filming.

*[[Danny Strong]] as '''Juke Box Boy''' and [[Marc Blucas]] as '''Basketball Hero''' are two of the teenagers who become "colored".  Both actors would have recurring roles in [[Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(TV_series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]; six other cast members of Pleasantville had single episode roles.

== Symbolism ==

Though one of the most notable aspects of ''Pleasantville'' is its cinematography - particularly its rich contrast between color and black and white, the symbolism in the film should be noted as well.  The most obvious symbolism exists in the "coloreds" versus those who are still black and white.  As a reference to the [[racism]] in the 1950s and 1960s in [[United States]], there is a sign posted in a shop window at one point declaring "No Coloreds Allowed", which referred to store owners refusing service to Black Americans during the aforementioned era.

Towards the end of the film, the courtroom scene is a throw back to [[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]], where [[Atticus Finch]] makes his famous closing argument.  As in ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', the courtroom is divided by skin color.  Sitting in the second floor balcony seats are the "coloreds", where Black Americans sat in ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', and the black and white people (White Americans) are sitting on the floor seats of the courtroom.  Bud, like Atticus Finch, also makes an impassioned speech to the judge and jury about the unfairness of the trial at hand; however, Bud is not the lawyer but instead one of the accused.  

In addition, there is a scene involving Bud and Margaret where she picks an apple for Bud from a nearby tree on Lover's Lane, and he eats it.  It strongly parallels the story of Adam and Eve, symbolizing the "Fall of Man," or in this case, the moment where Bud stops trying to live Pleasantville as a television show and really starts being his own version of Bud.  The moment is repeated a few scenes later, to further enforce this symbolism, when the TV Repairman berates Bud for that bite.

[[Gary Ross]] was quoted about the symbolism of the film, saying, "This movie is about the fact that personal repression gives rise to larger political oppression...That when we're afraid of certain things in ourselves or we're afraid of change, we project those fears on to other things, and a lot of very ugly social situations can develop". <ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/click/author-1099/reviews.php?rid=166920&cats=1&switches=best&sortby=rating&page=]</ref>

Another symbolic aspect to consider is the assumed connection between colors and loss of innocence. For example most of the time a black and white had sex or experienced a moment of pleasure they obtained color, suggesting the idea that humans as people are truly recognized and seen as their imperfections and differences are made more apparent. Lastly this idea is somewhat of a paradox and does hold true for certain characters in the movie. Jennifer has sex profusely but only gains color when she eschews sex in favor of her studies. Bud gains color only after he defends Betty from a band of thugs and experiences true anger and defence.
