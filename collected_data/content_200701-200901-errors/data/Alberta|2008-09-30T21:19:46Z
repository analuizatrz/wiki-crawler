'''Alberta''' ({{IPAEng|ælˈbɝtə}}) is one of [[Canada|Canada's]] [[Canadian Prairies|prairie]] [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]. It became a province on September 1, 1905.

Alberta is located in [[western Canada]], bounded by the provinces of [[British Columbia]] to the west and [[Saskatchewan]] to the east, the [[Northwest Territories]] to the north, and the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]] to the south. Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state (the others being [[New Brunswick]] and [[Yukon]]). It is also one of only two Canadian provinces that are [[landlocked]] (the other being Saskatchewan).

The [[capital city]] of Alberta is [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], located just south of the centre of the province. Roughly 300 km south of the capital is [[Calgary]], Alberta's largest city and a major distribution and transportation hub as well as one of Canada's major commerce centers. Edmonton is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's [[Athabasca Oil Sands|oil sands]] and other northern resource industries. According to recent population estimates, these two metropolitan areas have now both exceeded 1 million people.<ref>[http://www40.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/getcans/sorth.cgi?lan=eng&dtype=fina&filename=demo05a.htm&sortact=2&sortf=6 Statistics Canada—CMA population estimates]</ref> Other [[List of communities in Alberta|municipalities in the province]] include [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], [[Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]], [[Fort McMurray, Alberta|Fort McMurray]], [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]], [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]], [[Lloydminster]], [[Brooks, Alberta|Brooks]], [[Wetaskiwin, Alberta|Wetaskiwin]], [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Cold Lake, Alberta|Cold Lake]], and [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]].

Since December 14, 2006, the [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] of the province is Hon. [[Ed Stelmach]], [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]].

Alberta is named after [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise Caroline Alberta]] (1848–1939), the fourth daughter of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] and her husband, Prince Albert. Princess Louise was the wife of the [[John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]],  [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1878 to 1883. [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]], the village of [[Caroline, Alberta|Caroline]], and [[Mount Alberta]] were also named in honour of Princess Louise.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Alberta}}
Alberta is located in [[western Canada]] and covers an area of {{convert|661848|km2}}, an area about 5% smaller than [[Texas]] or 20% larger than [[metropolitan France|France]].<ref name=area>{{Cite web| url= http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/phys01.htm | title= Land and freshwater area, by province and territory | author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada | year= 2005 | month= February | accessdate= 2007-03-07}}</ref>. This makes it the fourth largest province after [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], and [[British Columbia]]. To the south, the province borders on the [[49th parallel north]], separating it from the U.S. state of [[Montana]], while on the north the [[60th parallel north]] divides it from the [[Northwest Territories]]. To the east the [[110th meridian west]] separates it from the province of [[Saskatchewan]], while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the [[120th meridian west]] south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the [[Continental Divide (Atlantic/Pacific)|Great Divide]] at the [[Rocky Mountains]], and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the [[continental divide]] in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N.

With the exception of the southeastern section, the province is well watered. Alberta contains dozens of rivers and lakes used for [[swimming]], [[water skiing]], [[fishing]] and a full range of other [[water sports]]. There are three large lakes and a multitude of smaller lakes less than 260&nbsp;km² each. Part of [[Lake Athabasca]] ({{nts|7898}}&nbsp;km²) lies in the province of Saskatchewan. [[Lake Claire (Albertan lake)|Lake Claire]] ({{nts|1436}}&nbsp;km²) lies just west of Lake Athabasca in [[Wood Buffalo National Park]]. [[Lesser Slave Lake]] ({{nts|1168}}&nbsp;km²) is northwest of [[Edmonton]].

[[Image:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Moraine Lake]] in [[Banff National Park]]]]
Alberta's capital city, [[Edmonton]], is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province, with most of western Canada's oil [[refinery]] capacity located nearby, in close proximity to most of Canada's largest [[oil field]]s. Edmonton is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. Alberta's other major city, [[Calgary]], is located approximately {{convert|280|km}} south of Edmonton and {{convert|240|km}} north of Montana, surrounding by extensive [[ranching]] country. Most of the northern half of the province is forested, while much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to [[grain]] or to [[dairy farming]], with [[mixed farming]] more common in the north and centre, while ranching and [[grasslands]] predominate in the south.

The Alberta [[badlands]] are located in southeastern Alberta, where the [[Red Deer River]] crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep [[gorge]]s and striking landforms. [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], near [[Brooks, Alberta]], showcases the badlands terrain, [[desert]] [[flora (plants)|flora]], and remnants from Alberta's past when [[dinosaur]]s roamed the then lush landscape.

Alberta is one of only two Canadian provinces to have no maritime coast (the other being the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan.)

===Climate===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=July 2008}}
Because Alberta extends for {{nts|1200}}&nbsp;km from north to south, and about 600&nbsp;km wide at its greatest east-west extent, it is natural that its climate should vary considerably. It is also further influenced by its elevation since the province is a high plateau. The elevation ranges from about {{nts|1000}} meters in the south (Calgary is about {{nts|1100}} meters and Red Deer is about {{nts|850}} meters) to {{nts|650}} meters in the north. The presence of a wall of mountains on the west and open prairies on the east also influences the weather.

Northern Alberta is mostly covered by [[taiga|boreal forest]] and has fewer frost-free days than southern Alberta, which has a semi-arid climate. The southeastern corner of Alberta experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter [[chinook wind]]s, while southeastern Alberta is a generally flat, dry prairie with some hills, where temperatures are most extreme. They can range from very cold (−35&nbsp;°C (−31&nbsp;°F) or lower in the winter) to very hot (38&nbsp;°C (100&nbsp;°F) or higher in the summer). Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely [[aspen parkland]], a [[biome]] transitional between [[prairie]] to the south and boreal forest to the north. After southern [[Ontario]], Central Alberta is the most likely region in Canada to experience [[tornadoes]]. [[Thunderstorm]]s, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is notable for having the highest frequency of [[hail]] in Canada, which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.

Overall, Alberta has cold winters, with a temperature average ranging from −10&nbsp;°C (14&nbsp;°F) in the south to −24&nbsp;°C (−12&nbsp;°F) in the north. In the south along the foothills of the Rockies, the winter cold is sometimes interrupted by [[Chinook winds]] which can propel temperatures upward in a short time frame close to or infrequently above 20&nbsp;°C (68&nbsp;°F). These conditions most commonly occur in February or March. In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around 21&nbsp;°C (70&nbsp;°F) in the Rocky Mountains (valleys) and far north to near 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F) in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation. Alberta experiences a good amount of sunshine for its northern location owing to its fairly dry climate; the east-central part of the province (bordering Saskatchewan) is the sunniest place in Canada with an average of over {{nts|2500}} hours each year.

== History ==
[[Image:Alexander Rutherford.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Alexander Rutherford]], Alberta's first premier]]
{{main|History of Alberta}}
The  province of Alberta, as far north as about 53° north latitude, was a part of [[Rupert's Land]] from the time of the incorporation of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (1670). After the arrival in the North-West of the French around 1731 they settled the prairies of the west, establishing communities such as [[Lac La Biche, Alberta|Lac La Biche]] and [[Bonnyville, Alberta|Bonnyville]]. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in 1752. The [[North West Company]] of [[Montreal]] occupied the northern part of Alberta territory before the Hudson's Bay Company arrived from Hudson Bay to take possession of it. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who, on behalf of the North West Company of Montreal, built [[Fort Athabasca]] on Lac La Biche in 1778. [[Roderick Mackenzie]] built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the [[Mackenzie River]]—which he followed to its outlet in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] upstream, eventually reaching the [[Pacific Ocean]], and so he became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2521|title=Alexander Mackenzie Biography|author=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|accessdate=2006-01-05}}</ref>

The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] as the first premier.

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Alberta population.svg|thumb|250px|right|Alberta's population has grown steadily for over a century.]]
{{main|Demographics of Alberta}}
Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as [[British Columbia]]), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.<ref>[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm StatCan—Alberta population]</ref>
Approximately 81% of the population live in urban areas and only about 19% live in rural areas. The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada.<ref name="muntypes">{{cite web|url=http://www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca/ms_TypesMunicipalitiesAlberta.htm|author=Alberta Municipal Affairs|title=Types of Municipalities in Alberta|date=2006-05-16|accessmonthday=December 18|accessyear=2006|authorlink =Alberta Municipal Affairs}}</ref> Many of Alberta's cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history. Over the past century, Alberta's population rose from 73,022 in 1901 to 2,974,807 in 2001<ref name="statcan2001">[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo62j.htm Population of Alberta]—Statistics Canada</ref> and 3,290,350 according to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 census]]<ref>[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=101 Population and dwelling counts (2006 Census)]</ref>

Although often thought of as being predominantly of [[English Canadian|English]] origin{{Fact|date=September 2008}}, Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from [[Scottish Canadian|Scotland]], [[Irish Canadian|Ireland]] and [[Canadians of Welsh descent|Wales]], but large numbers also came from other parts of [[Europe]], notably [[German Canadian|Germans]], [[French people|French]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainians]] and [[Scandinavians]]. According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of [[Francophones]] in western Canada (after [[Manitoba]]). Many of [[Franco-Albertan|Alberta's French-speaking residents]] live in the central and northwestern regions of the province. As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic [[Chinatown]]s, and Calgary has Canada's third largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s.  [[Aboriginal peoples in Alberta|Aboriginal Albertans]] make up approximately three percent of the population.

In the 2001 Canadian census, 387,445 Albertans (13.17%) identified themselves as [[Demographics of Canada|"Canadian"]] while 426,035 (14.49%) identified some other ethnicity as well as "Canadian", making a total of 813,485 (27.66%) for "Canadian". The other most commonly reported ethnicities were: 753,185 [[English-Canadian|English]] (25.61%); and 576,350 [[German-Canadian|German]] (19.60%); 556,575 [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]] (18.92%); 461,065 [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] (15.68%); 332,675 [[French Canadian|French]] (11.31%); 285,725 [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] (9.71%); 149,225 [[Canadians of Dutch descent|Dutch]] (5.07%); 144,040 [[North American Indian]] (4.90%); 137,625 [[Polish Canadians|Polish]] (4.68%); 120,050 [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] (4.08%); and 108,050 [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] (3.67%). <small>''(Each person could choose more than one ethnicity.)''</small><ref>[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/ETO/Table1.cfm?T=501&Lang=E&GV=1&GID=48&S=1&O=D Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada (2001 Census)]</ref>

Amongst those of British origins, the [[Scottish Canadian|Scots]] have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary, [[Airdrie, Alberta|Airdrie]], [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]], and [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]]) having [[Scottish place names in Canada|Scottish]] origins.

=== Religion ===
{{Refimprovesect|date=February 2008}}
[[Image:Alberta Population by Religion.PNG|thumb|Alberta has a large number of different religions, of which Catholic is the most common.]]
As of the [[Canada 2001 Census]] the largest religious group was [[Roman Catholic]], representing 25.7% of the population. Alberta had the second highest percentage of [[non-religious]] residents in Canada (after [[British Columbia]]) at 23.1% of the population. Of the remainder, 13.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the [[United Church of Canada]], while 5.9% were [[Anglican Church in Canada|Anglican]]. [[Lutherans]] made up 4.8% of the population while [[Baptists]] comprised 2.5%. The remainder had a wide variety of different religious affiliations, although no individual group constituted more than 2% of the population.<ref>

</ref> 

The [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] of Alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province and made up 1.7% of the population. Alberta has a population of [[Hutterite]]s, a communal [[Anabaptist]] sect similar to the [[Mennonites]] (Hutterites represented 0.4% of the population while Mennonites were 0.8%), and has a significant population of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] at 0.3%. Alberta is home to several [[Byzantine Rite]] Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton]], and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]]'s [[Archbishop of Edmonton and Western Canada|Western Diocese]] which is based in Edmonton.

[[Muslim]]s, [[Sikh]]s, and [[Hindu]]s live in Alberta. Muslims constituted 1.7% of the population, Sikhs 0.8% and Hindus 0.5%. Many of these are recent immigrants, but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} North America's oldest mosque is located in Edmonton.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Jews constituted 0.4% of Alberta's population. Most of Alberta's 13,000 [[Jew]]s live in Calgary (7,500) and Edmonton (5,000).<ref>[http://www.amyisrael.co.il/na/canada/ AM Yisrael]—The Jewish Communities of Canada</ref>

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Alberta}}

Alberta's economy is one of the strongest in Canada, supported by the burgeoning [[petroleum]] industry and to a lesser extent, [[agriculture]] and technology. The per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]74,825. This was 61% higher than the national average of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]46,441 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.statcan.ca/english/ads/11-010-XPB/pdf/sep06.pdf|format=pdf |author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada | title= The Alberta economic Juggernaut:The boom on the rose| month= September |year= 2006| accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> According to the 2006 census<ref>[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/income/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Table=5&Data1=1&Data2=1&StartRec=1&Sort=2&Display=Page 2006 Census: Income and Earnings, April 2008]</ref>, the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole). 

The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).<ref name="CECorridor">{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=[[2003-01-20]]|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style quality of life, offering [[universal health care]] benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.

According to the [[Fraser Institute]], Alberta also has very high levels of [[economic freedom]]. It is by far the most free economy in Canada,<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/shared/readmore.asp?sNav=nr&id=633 | title= Alberta Rated as Best Investment Climate | author= The Fraser Institute | authorlink= Fraser Institute| year= 2006| month= November | accessdate= 2007-03-02}}</ref> and is rated as the 2nd most free economy of U.S. states and Canadian provinces.<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.freetheworld.com/efna.html | title= Economic Freedom of North America 2008 Annual Report| author= The Fraser Institute | authorlink= Fraser Institute| year= 2008| accessdate= 2008-08-01}} ISBN 0-88975-213-3</ref>

=== Industry ===
[[Image:Syncrude mildred lake plant.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mildred Lake mine site and plant at the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] ]]
Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], [[natural gas]] and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.<ref>Government of Alaksa. [http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm Alaska and Alberta - An Overview]</ref> Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in [[North America]] are located in central and north central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, world class [[polyethylene]] and [[vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical]] industry to the east of Edmonton.

The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[non-conventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254&nbsp;km³). With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]], which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about 315 billion barrels (50&nbsp;km³) of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing  cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.<ref>[http://www.buyusa.gov/montana/canadaoilsands.html Canada Oilsands Opportunites]</ref>

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the Tar Sands is the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive [[liquid crystal display]] systems.<ref>[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5448263.html Interactive display system]—US Patent U.S. Patent No. 5,448,263; [http://www2.smarttech.com/st/en-US/About+Us/News+Room/Media+Releases/2002+Media+Releases.htm?guid=%7BB3BD6857-5D25-4EC7-A741-C0232368F5FE%7D U.S. Patent for Touch Sensitive Technology]—SMART Technologies</ref> With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

=== Agriculture and forestry ===

[[Image:Field 150.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Canola]] field in [[central Alberta]]]]

[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. The province has over three million head of [[cattle]],<ref>[http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 Alberta Livestock Inspections—August 2006]—Alberta Government, Department of Agriculture</ref> and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|mutton]] are also raised.

[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Grain elevator in [[southern Alberta]]]]

[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other [[cereal|grains]] are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] canola also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.

The vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].

=== Tourism ===
[[Image:Stephen Avenue.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Stephen Avenue]], Calgary.]]
{{main|Tourism in Alberta}}
Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as [[West Edmonton Mall]],[[Calgary Stampede]], outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the [[Commonwealth Games]] and [[Olympic Games]], as well as more eclectic attractions. There are also natural attractions like [[Elk Island National Park]], [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], and the [[Columbia Icefield]].

According to Alberta Economic Development, Edmonton and Calgary both host over four million visitors annually. Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.<ref>Alberta Economic Development. [http://www.alberta-canada.com/statpub/tourismStatistics/tdr.cfm/ Tourism Statistics]</ref>

[[Image:Lake Louise 17092005.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]] in the [[Canadian Rockies]]]]
Alberta's Rocky Mountains include well known tourist destinations [[Banff National Park]] and [[Jasper National Park]]. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic [[Icefields Parkway]]. Banff is located 128&nbsp;km west of Calgary on [[Alberta Highway 1|Highway 1]], and Jasper is located 366&nbsp;km west of Edmonton on [[Yellowhead Highway]]. Five of Canada's fourteen [[UNESCO]] [[World heritage site]]s are located within the province: [[Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks]], [[Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park]], Wood Buffalo National Park, [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] and [[Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump]].

About 1.2 million people pass through the gates of Calgary's world-famous Stampede,<ref>[http://www.stampede.coolattractions.com/history.html Calgary Stampede highlights]</ref> a celebration of Canada's own [[Wild West]] and the cattle ranching industry. About 800,000 people enjoy Edmonton's [[Capital Ex]] (formerly Klondike Days).<ref>[http://capitalex.ca/history.html CapitalEX]—Fair History</ref> Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the [[Yukon]] [[gold field]]s, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous [[Chilkoot Pass]].

Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. Drumheller, "Dinosaur Capital of The World", offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years. The Canadian Badlands has much to offer in the way of attractions, cultural events, celebrations, accommodations and service.

Located in east-central Alberta is [[Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions]], a popular tourist attraction operated out of [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]]. It boasts one of the few operable steam trains in the world, offering trips through the rolling prairie scenery. Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.

Alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to [[skiing|ski]] and [[hiking|hike]]; Alberta boasts several world-class [[ski resort]]s such as [[Sunshine Village]], [[Lake Louise Mountain Resort|Lake Louise]], [[Marmot Basin]], [[Mount Norquay ski resort|Norquay]] and [[Nakiska]]. Hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive [[trophy|trophies]] and [[tall tales]] from their experiences in Alberta's wilderness.

===Taxation===
The province's revenue comes mainly from the taxation of oil, natural gas, beef, softwood lumber, and wheat, but also includes a tax on corporate and personal income, gaming revenue, and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for [[infrastructure]] projects. Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]]). Alberta's municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.

== Transportation ==
[[Image:DavidThompsonHighway.JPG|left|thumb|200px| David Thompson Highway outside of [[Banff National Park]]]]
Alberta has over 180,000&nbsp;km of [[highway]]s and roads, of which nearly 50,000&nbsp;km are paved. The main north-south [[corridor]] is [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]], which begins south of [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] at the [[Carway, Alberta|Carway]] border crossing and is part of the [[CANAMEX Corridor]]. [[Alberta Highway 4|Highway 4]], which effectively extends [[Interstate 15]] into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the [[Coutts, Alberta|Coutts]] border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. [[Alberta Highway 3|Highway 3]] joins Lethbridge to [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]] and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton before dividing into two highways. The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the [[Queen Elizabeth II Highway]] to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005. Past Edmonton, one branch continues northwest as [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] into Grande Prairie and the [[Peace River Country]]; the other ([[Alberta Highway 63|Highway 63]]) travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the [[Athabasca Tar Sands|Athabasca Oil Sands]]. Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: [[Alberta Highway 22|Highway 22]], west of highway 2, known as "the cowboy trail," and [[Alberta Highway 21|Highway 21]], east of highway 2.

Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through [[Banff National Park]]. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network but known alternatively as the [[Yellowhead Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 16|Highway 16]]), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and [[Jasper National Park]] into [[British Columbia]]. One of the most scenic drives is along the [[Icefields Parkway]], which runs for 228&nbsp;km between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.

[[Image:Alberta License Plate 2005.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Current [[Vehicle registration plates of Alberta|Alberta licence plate]]]]
Another major corridor through central Alberta is [[Alberta Highway 11|Highway 11]] (also known as the [[David Thompson]] Highway), which runs west from the [[Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta|Saskatchewan River Crossing]] in Banff National Park through [[Rocky Mountain House]] and [[Red Deer]], connecting with [[Alberta Highway 12|Highway 12]] 20&nbsp;km west of [[Stettler]].  The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.

Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and [[freeway]]s are often called ''trails''. For example, Highway 2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called [[Deerfoot Trail]] as it passes through Calgary but becomes [[Calgary Trail]] as it enters Edmonton and then turns into Saint Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the city of [[Saint Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban [[expressway]]s ''trails'' and naming many of them after prominent [[first nations]] individuals and tribes, such as [[Crowchild Trail]], Deerfoot Trail, and [[Stoney Trail]].

{{seealso|List of Alberta provincial highways}}

Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial [[public transit]] systems. In addition to buses, Edmonton and Calgary operate [[light rail transit]] (LRT) systems. [[Edmonton LRT]], which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside of it, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary [[C-Train]], although it operates almost entirely on the surface, has the highest ridership of any LRT system in North America.

Alberta is well-connected by air, with [[international airport]]s at both Edmonton and Calgary. [[Calgary International Airport]] and [[Edmonton International Airport]] are the fourth and fifth [[Canada's busiest airport|busiest in Canada]] respectively. Calgary's [[airport]] is a hub for [[WestJet|WestJet Airlines]] and a regional hub for [[Air Canada]]. Calgary's airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, and four destinations in [[Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]].<ref>[http://www.yyc.com/ Calgary International Airport]</ref>  Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.

{{seealso|List of airports in Alberta}}

There are over 9,000&nbsp;km of operating mainline railway, and many tourists see Alberta aboard [[Via Rail]] or ''Rocky Mountain Railtours''. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] companies operate railway [[freight]] across the province.

== Government ==
{{main|Politics of Alberta|Monarchy in Alberta}}

The government of Alberta is organized as a [[parliamentary]] [[democracy]] with a unicameral legislature.  Its [[unicameral]] legislature—the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]]—consists of eighty-three members.

Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.  Municipalities where the same body act as both local government and school board are formally referred to as "counties" in Alberta.

As Canada's [[head of state]], [[Queen Elizabeth II]], is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor Norman Kwong.  Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a [[figurehead]] whose actions are restricted by custom and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]].  The government is therefore headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|premier]]. The current premier is Ed Stelmach who was elected as leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on December 2, 2006.  Stelmach was sworn in as the 13th [[Premier of Alberta]] on December 15, 2006. [[Image:Edmonton leg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Alberta's Legislative Building in Edmonton.]]
The Premier is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and he draws all the members of his Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly.

The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of Alberta.

Alberta's elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces. Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives ("Conservatives" or "Tories"), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]]. A fourth party, the strongly conservative [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta. In fact, only four parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to the present.

Alberta has had occasional surges in [[Alberta separatism|separatist sentiment]]. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums. There are several groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form currently active in the province.

In the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 provincial election]], held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the [[Alberta Liberal Party]] was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and the [[Alberta New Democratic Party]] elected two members.<ref>  [http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/ Election results at CTV]</ref>

== Health Care ==

As with all Canadian provinces, Alberta provides for all citizens and residents through a [[publicly-funded health care]] system. Alberta became Canada's second province (after [[Saskatchewan]]) to adopt a [[Tommy Douglas]]-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern [[Medicare_(Canada)|medicare]] system.

{{See also|Health care in Canada}}

Alberta's health care budget is currently $13.2 billion during the 2008-2009 fiscal year (aproximately 36% of all government spending), making it the most well funded health care system per-capita in Canada. Every hour more than $1.5 million is spent on health care in the province.

Currently, 6% of the province's health care is funded by a monthy insurance premium of $44 per person or $88 per family (with exceptions on senior citizens, minors, students, and low-income earners). These fees are to be eliminated as of January 1, 2009.

A highly-educated population and burgeoning economy have made Alberta a national leader in health education, research, and resources. Many notable facilities include the [[University of Alberta Hospital]] complex, the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital (Edmonton)|Royal Alexandra Hospital]], the [[Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute]], the Lois Hole Hospital for Women, the [[Stollery Children's Hospital]], the Alberta Diabetes Institute, the Cross Cancer Institute, and the Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research in [[Edmonton]]. [[Calgary]] is also host to the [[Foothills Medical Centre]], the [[Peter Lougheed Centre]], and the [[Alberta Children's Hospital]].

Currently under construction in [[Edmonton]] is the new $909 million [[Edmonton Clinic]], which will provide a similar research, education, and care environment as the [[Mayo Clinic]] in the [[United States]].

[[Image:Alberta Children's Hospital 3+4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Alberta Children's Hospital]]]]

[[Health Care]] in Alberta is administered by the unified Alberta Health Services Board. Prior to July 1, 2008 Alberta was divided into nine [[Health regions of Canada|health regions]]: [[Aspen Regional Health Authority]]: [[Calgary Health Region]], [[Capital Health]] (Edmonton), [[Chinook Health]], [[David Thompson Regional Health Authority]], [[East Central Health]], [[Northern Lights Health Region]], [[Palliser Health Region]] and [[Peace Country Health Region]].

== Education ==
{{main|Education in Alberta}}
As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).
[[Image:SAIT Heart Building 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Heritage Hall at [[SAIT Polytechnic]].]]

===Elementary schools===

There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] electorate, and one ([[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]) has a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.

For many years the [[Government of Alberta|provincial government]] has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K–12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property, as supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K–12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K–12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.

[[Public school|Public]] and separate school boards, [[charter school]]s, and [[private school]]s all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies.  Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.

===Universities===

[[Image:St Joes Edmonton UofA.JPG‎|thumb|right|St. Joseph’s College at [[University of Alberta]]]]

Alberta's oldest and largest university is Edmonton's [[University of Alberta]] established in 1908. The [[University of Calgary]], once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta. There is also [[Athabasca University]], which focuses on distance learning, and the [[University of Lethbridge]]. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]] and [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]].<ref>[http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/college/postsecsystem/postsecinst/postsecinst.asp Post Secondary Education]</ref>   There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, including [[DeVry University]]. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier Ralph Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.<ref>[http://www.su.ualberta.ca/su/student_government/advocacy/ University of Alberta—Ralph Klein promises tuition freeze]</ref>  So far, no plan has been released by the government of Alberta.

== Culture ==

[[Image:StampedeRodeo2002.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Calgary Stampede]]]]
{{main|Culture of Alberta}}
Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta. The [[Edmonton Fringe Festival]] is the world's  second largest after [[Edinburgh]]'s. The Folk music festivals in both Calgary and Edmonton are two of Canada's largest and both cities host a number of annual multicultural events. With a large number of summer and winter events, Edmonton prides itself as being the "Festival City". The city's [[Edmonton Heritage Festival|"heritage days" festival]] sees the participation of over 70 national groups. Calgary is also home to [[Carifest]], the second largest Caribbean festival in the nation (after [[Caribana]] in [[Toronto]]). The city is also famous for its [[Calgary Stampede]], dubbed "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth." The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as [[calf roping]] and [[bull riding]]. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts. The [[Banff Centre]] also hosts a range of festivals and other events including the internationally known [[Banff Mountain Film Festival|Mountain Film Festival]].   These cultural events in Alberta highlight the province's cultural diversity and love of entertainment. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the [[Francis Winspear Centre for Music]].

{{seealso|Festivals in Alberta}}

Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to [[Canadian Football League]] and [[National Hockey League]] teams. [[Association football|Soccer]], [[rugby union]] and [[lacrosse]] are also played professionally in Alberta.

== Ecology ==
=== Flora ===
In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie crocus [[anemone]], the [[three flowered avens]], [[golden bean]], and other early flowers. The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the [[sunflower]] family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple. The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the [[prairie coneflower]], [[fleabane]], and [[Sagebrush|sage]]. Both yellow and white [[sweet clover]] fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[aspen]], [[poplar]], and [[willow]]. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. [[aspen|Aspen poplar]], [[balsam poplar]] (or [[cottonwood]]), and [[paper birch]] are the primary large deciduous species. [[Conifer]]s include [[Jack pine]], Rocky Mountain pine, [[Lodgepole pine]], both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[tamarack]].

=== Fauna ===
The three climatic regions ([[Alpine climate|alpine]], forest, and prairie) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, its grasses providing a great pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a strong comeback and thrive on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

[[Image:Ovis canadensis 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Bighorn Sheep]] is Alberta's provincial animal]]
Alberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[Grizzly bear|grizzly]] and [[American Black Bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[Canidae|canine]] and [[feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]], [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[mountain lion]] (cougar).

[[Herbivorous]] animals are found throughout the province. [[Moose]], [[mule deer]], and [[white-tail deer]] are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the Rocky Mountains. [[Rabbit]]s, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of [[venomous snake]], the prairie [[rattlesnake]].

Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are well stocked with [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[walleye]], [[whitefish]], [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], and [[Brown trout|brown]] [[trout]], and even [[sturgeon]]. [[Turtle]]s are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. [[Frog]]s and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.

Alberta is the only province in Canada&mdash;as well as one of the few places in the world&mdash;which is free of [[brown rat|Norwegian rat]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument |title = The History of Rat Control in Alberta| author=Alberta Department of Agriculture| accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref> Since the early 1950s, the government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats which have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions.
