The '''Cleomenean War'''<ref name="Polybius 2.46">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.46 2.46]</ref> (229 BC/228 BC &ndash; 222 BC) was fought between [[Sparta]] and its ally [[Elis]] against the [[Achaean League]] and [[Macedon]]. The war ended in a Macedonian and Achaean victory.

In 235 BC, [[Cleomenes III]] ascended the throne of Sparta and began a program of reform to restore the old Spartan discipline and depose the [[ephors]]. When the ephors sent Cleomenes to seize a town on the border with [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]], the Achaeans declared war in 229 BC. Cleomenes responded by ravaging Achaea; he defeated an army under Aratus sent to attack Elis at Mount Lycaeum, and second army near Megalopolis. He also ordered that the ephors be killed.

In quick succession, Cleomenes cleared the cities of [[Arcadia]] of their Achaean garrisons before crushing another Achaean force at [[Battle of Dyme|Dyme]]. Facing Spartan domination of the League, Aratus was forced to turn to [[Antigonus III Doson]] of [[Macedon]] to help the Achaeans defeat the Spartans. In return for Macedonian assistance, the Achaeans had to surrender [[Acrocorinth]] to Antigonus. Cleomenes invaded [[Achaea]] and took control of both [[Corinth]] and [[Argos]], but, when Antigonus arrived in the Peloponnese, Cleomenes was forced to retreat to [[Laconia]]. He fought the Achaeans and the Macedonians at [[Battle of Sellasia|Sellasia]], but the Spartans were routed. He fled to the court of his ally, [[Ptolemy III of Egypt]], where he eventually committed suicide after a failed revolt.

==Prelude==
[[Cleomenes III]] ascended the throne of [[Sparta]] in 236 BC or 235 BC from his father [[Leonidas II]]<ref name="Plutarch3">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 3</ref><ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref> in a decade where dispute between the two royal families were at a peak. During the turmoil, Leonidas II had his rival king, the reformist [[Agis IV]], executed.<ref name="Plutarch20">Plutarch, ''Life of Agis, 20</ref>

In 229 BC, Cleomenes took the cities [[Tegea]], [[Mantineia]], [[Caphyae]] and [[Orchomenus]] in [[Arcadia]], who had by then allied themselves with the [[Aetolian League]].<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch4">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 4</ref> Historians, [[Polybius]] and [[Sir William Smith]] claim that Cleomenes seized the city by treachery; however, the translator of Plutarch on Sparta, Richard Talbert, says Cleomenes took them at their own request.<ref name="Polybius 2.46">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.46 2.46]</ref><ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch4">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 4</ref> Later that year, the [[ephors]] sent Cleomenes to seize the [[Athenaeum]], which was near Belbina, one of the entrance points into [[Laconia]] disputed at the time between Sparta and [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]]. Meanwhile, the Achaean League summoned a meeting of its assembly and declared war against Sparta.<ref name="Polybius 2.46">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.46 2.46]</ref> Cleomenes then fortified the position; in retaliation, [[Aratus of Sicyon]], the [[strategus]] of the [[Achaean League]], tried to take Tegea and Orchomenus in a night attack. When the efforts from inside the city failed, Aratus retreated, hoping to remain unnoticed.<ref name="Plutarch4">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 4</ref>{{Cref|a}}

Cleomenes discovered the plan, and sent a message to Aratus asking about the goal of the expedition.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch4">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 4</ref> Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Belbina.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref> Cleomenes responded to this by saying: "if it's all the same to you, write and tell me why you brought along those torches and ladders."<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch4">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 4</ref>

==Early years and success==
[[Image:SouthernPeloponessus.gif|300px|right|thumb|A map of the Southern Peloponnese]]

After fortifying Belbina, Cleomenes advanced into Arcadia with 3,000 [[infantry]] and a few [[cavalry]]. However, he was called back by the ephors, which allowed Aratus to seize Caphyae as soon as Cleomenes returned to Laconia. Once this news reached Sparta, the ephors sent Cleomenes out again; he managed to capture the Megalopian city Methydrium before ravaging the land around [[Argos]].<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch4">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 4</ref>

Around this time the Achaean League sent an army under a new strategus – [[Aristomachos of Argos]], who had been elected in May of 228 BC – to meet Cleomenes in battle. The Achaean army of 20,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry advanced on the 5,000-strong Spartan army at [[Pallantium]]. Aratus, who had accompanied Aristomachus, advised him to retreat.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch4">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 4</ref> Smith agrees with Aratus' assessment that 20,000 Achaeans were no match for 5,000 Spartans.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Ptolemy III]] of [[Egypt]], who had been an ally of the Achaean League in their wars against Macedon, shifted his financial support to Sparta. Ptolemy made this decision after calculating that a resurgent Sparta would be a more valuable ally against Macedon than the Achaean League.<ref name="Polybius 2.51">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.51 2.51]</ref><ref name="Green249">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 249</ref>

In May 227 BC, Aratus was once again elected strategus and attacked [[Elis]].<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref> The Elians appealed to Sparta for aid; as the Achaeans were returning from Elis, Cleomenes attacked and routed their entire army near Mount Lycaeum. Taking advantage of a rumour that he had been killed during the fighting, Aratus attacked and seized Mantinea.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch5">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 5</ref>

Meanwhile, the [[Kings of Sparta|Eurypontid King]] Eudamidas III, son of Agis IV, died. [[Pausanias]] claims that Cleomenes had him poisoned.<ref name="Pausanias 2.9.1">[[#Pausanias|Pausanias]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+2.9.1]</ref>
Cleomenes recalled his uncle [[Archidamus V]] from his exile in [[Messene]] to ascend the Eurypontid throne,<ref name="Plutarch5">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 5</ref> but as soon as Archidamus returned to the city, he was assassinated.<ref name="Plutarch5">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 5</ref> Cleomenes' involvement in the plot is unclear, since ancient sources contradict each other: Polybius claims that Cleomenes ordered the murder, but Plutarch disagrees.<ref name="Plutarch5">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 5</ref><ref name="Polybius 5.37">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+5.37 5.37]</ref>

==Battle of Ladoceia and Reforms==
[[Image:Greek hoplite.png|right|thumb|250px|A typical Greek hoplite]]

Later that year, Cleomenes bribed the ephors to allow him to continue his campaign against the Achaeans. Having succeeded in his bribe, Cleomenes advanced into the territory of Megalopolis and captured the village of [[Leuctra]].<ref name="Plutarch6">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 6</ref> In response, an Achaean army arrived, relieved the city and inflicted a minor defeat on the part of the Spartan army nearest to the city walls. Cleomenes was therefore obliged to retreat with his troops across a series of ravines. Aratus ordered the Achaeans not to pursue the Spartans across the ravine, but [[Lydiadas of Megalopolis]] disobeyed the order and charged with the cavalry in pursuit of the Spartans.<ref name="Plutarch6">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 6</ref> Taking advantage of the difficult terrain and the scattered cavalry, Cleomenes sent his Cretan and Tarentine soldiers against Lydiades. They routed the cavalry, and Lydiadas was amongst the dead.<ref name="Plutarch6">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 6</ref> The Spartans, encouraged by these events, charged against the main Achaean forces and routed the entire army.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch6">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 6</ref> The Achaeans were so disgusted and discouraged by Aratus' failure to support Lydiades that they made no further attacks in that year.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref>

Cleomenes, who was now confident of his strong position, began plotting against the ephors. He first recruited his step-father by saying that they needed to get rid of the ephors; they could then make their property common to all citizens and make Sparta supreme in Greece.<ref name="Plutarch7">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 7</ref> Having won over his step-father, Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Using the men he considered most likely to oppose him, he captured Heraea and [[Asea]]. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus – which the Achaeans were besieging – before camping outside Mantinea.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch7">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 7</ref> This campaign wore out his opponents, who asked to be left in Arcadia so they could rest.<ref name="Plutarch7">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 7</ref> Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to kill the ephors. All of the five ephors were killed except for Agylaeus, who managed to escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch78">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 8</ref><ref name="Green257">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 257</ref>

With the ephors out of the way, Cleomenes started his reforms. First he handed over his land to the state; he was soon followed by his step-father and his friends, and then by the rest of the citizens.<ref name="Green257">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 257</ref><ref name="Plutarch11">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 11</ref> He divided up all the land and gave an equal lot to every citizen.<ref name="Green257">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 257</ref> He increased the citizen population by making some [[perioeci]] citizens, then trained 4,000 hoplites and restored the old Spartan social and military discipline.<ref name="Green257">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 257</ref><ref name="Plutarch11">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 11</ref> Cleomenes greatly strengthened his army by introducing the Macedonian [[sarissa]] (pike).<ref name="Green257">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 257</ref> He completed his reforms by placing his brother, [[Eucleidas]], in charge, making him the first Agiad king on the Eurypontid throne.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of  and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch11">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 11</ref>

== Domination of the Peloponnese ==
[[Image:Octadrachm Ptolemy III BM CMBMC103.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A coin depicting Ptolemy III of Egypt]]

Meanwhile [[Ptolemy III of Egypt]] offered to assist Cleomenes in return for the Spartan King's mother and children as hostages. Cleomenes hesitated until his mother heard about Ptolemy's offer and went voluntarily to Egypt.<ref name="Green258">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 258</ref><ref name="Plutarch22">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 22</ref>

In 226 BC, the citizens of Mantinea appealed to Cleomenes to expel the Achaean garrison from the city.<ref name="Plutarch14">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 14</ref> One night, he crept into the city and expelled the Achaean garrison before marching off to Tegea.<ref name="Green258">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 258</ref> From Tegea, the Spartans advanced into [[Achaea]], where Cleomenes hoped to force the League to meet him in a pitched battle. Cleomenes advanced with his army to [[Dyme]] and was met by the entire Achaean army.<ref name="Plutarch14">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 14</ref> In the battle that followed, the Spartans routed the Achaean [[phalanx]] killing many of the Achaeans and capturing others. Following this victory, Cleomenes captured the city of Lasium and gave it to the Elians.<ref name="Green258">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 258</ref><ref name="Plutarch14">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 14</ref>

The Achaean League was demoralized by this battle, Aratus declined the generalship and when both [[Athens]] and the Aetolian League turned down their appeals, they asked Cleomenes for peace.<ref name="Habicht185">Habicht, ''Athens from Alexander to Antony'', 185</ref> At first, Cleomenes made only small requests from the Achaean delegates; the Achaeans kept sending ambassadors, however, and Cleomenes demanded that leadership of the League be surrendered to him; in exchange he would return to the Achaeans the prisoners and the strongholds he had seized.<ref name="Plutarch15">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 15</ref><ref name="Green258">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 258</ref> The Achaeans invited Cleomenes to [[Lerna]], where they were holding council. Cleomenes, while marching there, drank too much water; this caused him to lose his voice and bring up blood, forcing a return to Sparta.<ref name="Plutarch15">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 15</ref><ref name="Green258">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 258</ref>

Aratus took advantage of this event, and started plotting with King [[Antigonus III Doson]] of [[Macedon]]. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis were sent to Macedon requesting help. Antigonus was not interested at the time, and these efforts failed.<ref name="Grainger252">Grainger, ''The League of Aitolians, 252</ref> He wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes in return for control of [[Acrocorinth]].<ref name="Plutarch16">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 16</ref> This was not a sacrifice the League was willing to make.<ref name="Green258">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 258</ref> The German historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] criticizes Aratus' alliance with Macedon, arguing that "old Aratus sacrificed the freedom of his country by an act of high treason, and gave up Corinth rather than establish the freedom of Greece by a union among the Peloponnesians, which would have secured to Cleomenes the influence and power he deserved."<ref name="Barthold Georg Niebuhr">[[#Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] [http://ia340925.us.archive.org/3/items/niebuhrslectures02niebiala/niebuhrslectures02niebiala_djvu.txt]</ref>

When the Achaeans arrived at [[Argos]] for an assembly, Cleomenes came down from Tegea to meet them.<ref name="Plutarch17">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 17</ref> But Aratus – who had reached an agreement with Antigonus – demanded that Cleomenes give 300 hostages to the Achaeans and come to the city alone, or approach the city with all his forces. When this message reached Cleomenes, he declared that he had been wronged and once again declared war on the Acheans.<ref name="Plutarch17">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 17</ref>

Achaea was now in turmoil and some cities were close to revolting; they were angry that Aratus had invited the Macedonians into the Peloponnese. They also hoped that Cleomenes would impose constitutional changes in their cities. Encouraged by this, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus and Penteleium.<ref name="Plutarch17">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 17</ref> The Achaeans, worried about developing treachery in [[Corinth]] and [[Sicyon]], dispatched their mercenaries to garrison the cities, then went to [[Argos]] to celebrate the [[Nemean Games]].<ref name="Plutarch17">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 17</ref>

Cleomenes estimated that Argos would be easier to capture while filled with festival-goers and spectators to cause panic. During the night, he seized the rugged area above the city's theatre. The people of the city were too terrified to offer resistance. They accepted a garrison, delivered twenty hostages to Cleomenes and became Spartan allies.<ref name="Plutarch17">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 17</ref><ref name="Green259">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 259</ref> The capture of Argos gave Cleomenes' reputation a massive boost, since no Spartan King had ever managed to seize Argos. Even [[Pyrrhus]], one the most famous generals of the age, was killed while trying to take the city.<ref name="Plutarch18">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 18</ref>

Soon after the seizure of Argos, [[Cleonae]] and [[Phlius]] surrendered themselves to Cleomenes. Meanwhile, Aratus was in Corinth investigating those suspected of supporting Sparta. When he heard what had happened at Corinth, Aratus expected the city to fall to Sparta. He summoned an assembly and, with all the citizens present, he took his horse and fled to [[Sicyon]].<ref name="Plutarch19">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 19</ref> The Corinthians did surrender the city to Cleomenes, but the Spartan king criticized them for failing to arrest Aratus.<ref name="Green259">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 259</ref><ref name="Plutarch19">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 19</ref> Cleomenes sent his step-father Megistonous to Aratus, asking for the surrender of [[Acrocorinth]] – the [[citadel]] of Corinth, which had a Achaean garrison – in return for a large amount of money.<ref name="Plutarch19">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 19</ref>

In quick succession, [[Hermione]], [[Troezen]] and [[Epidaurus]] surrendered to Cleomenes, who went from Argos to Corinth and started besieging the citadel. He sent a messenger to Aratus proposing that Acrocorinth should be garrisoned jointly by both the Spartans and the Achaeans, and that he would deliver a twelve [[Talent (measurement)|talent]] pension.<ref name="Green259">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 259</ref><ref name="Plutarch19">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 19</ref> Aratus faced the hard decision of whether to give the city to Antigonus or to let it fall to Cleomenes.<ref name="Green259">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 259</ref> He chose to conclude an alliance with Antigonus and sent his son as a hostage to Macedon. Cleomenes invaded the territory of Sicyon and ravaged it.<ref name="Plutarch19">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 19</ref>

==Macedonian Intervention==
[[Image:Antigonus Doson.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coin of Antigonus III Doson]]

Meanwhile, Antigonus, who had brought with him a large force of 20,000 infantry and 1,400 cavalry, was marching through [[Euboea]] towards the Peloponnese.<ref name="Plutarch">Plutarch, [http://www.attalus.org/old/aratus2.= Life of Aratus]"</ref> The hostile [[Aetolian League]] occupying [[Thessaly]] had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than [[Thermopylae]], despite their neutrality to this point in the war.<ref name="Polybius 2.52">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.52 2.52]</ref><ref name="Grainger252">Grainger, ''The League of Aitolians, 252</ref> When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and [[palisade]] running from Acrocorinth to the [[Isthmus]].

Despite numerous attempts to break through the defensive line and reach [[Lechaeum]], Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses.<ref name="Plutarch20">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 20</ref> These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus that he considered advancing his attack of the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos; they invited Antigonus to come to their city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of [[Aristoteles]], as they were irritated that Cleomenes had not made any reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategus for the year, [[Timoxenos]], advanced with more men from Sicyon.<ref name="Plutarch20">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 20</ref> When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was in the hands of the Argives.<ref name="Plutarch21">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 21</ref>

[[Image:Lechaeum.png|right|300px|thumb|A map of the area around Corinth]]

When Cleomenes heard about the revolt at Argos, he sent his step-father with 2,000 men to try and save the situation. Megistonous was killed while assaulting the city, however, and the relief force retreated, leaving the Spartans in the citadel to continue resisting. Cleomenes abandoned his much stronger position at the Isthumus for fear of being encircled; he left Corinth to fall into the hands of Antigonus.<ref name="Plutarch21">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 21</ref><ref name="Polybius 2.53">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.53 2.53]</ref> Cleomenes advanced his troops upon Argos and forced his way into the city, rescuing the men stuck in the citadel. He retreated to Mantinea when he saw Antigonus' army on the plain outside the city.<ref name="Plutarch21">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 21</ref>

After retreating into Arcadia, Cleomenes returned to Sparta, after receiving news of his wife's death.<ref name="Plutarch22">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 22</ref> This left Antigonus free to advance through Arcadia and on the towns that Cleomenes had fortified, including Athenaeum – which he gave to Megalopolis. He continued to [[Aegium]], where the Achaeans were holding their council.

Antigonus took the opportunity to revive the [[Hellenic League]] of [[Philip II]] of Macedon, under the name League of Leagues. Most of the Greek city states took part in the league.  These included Macedon, Achaea, [[Boeotia]], Thessaly, [[Phocis]], [[Locris]], [[Acarnania]], [[Euboea]] and [[Epiros]].<ref name="Habicht178">Habicht, ''Athens from Alexander to Antony'', 178</ref> [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]] claims that for Antigonus the League was just a way to further Macedon's power.<ref name="Green260">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 260</ref>

In the early spring of 223 BC, Antigonus advanced upon [[Tegea]].  He was joined there by the Achaeans and together they laid siege to it.  The Tegeans held out for a few days before being forced to surrender by the Macedonians' siege weapons.<ref name="Polybius 2.54">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.54 2.54]</ref><ref name="Plutarch23">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 23</ref> After the capture of Tegea, Antigonus advanced to [[Laconia]], where he found Cleomenes' army waiting for him.  When his scouts brought news that the garrison of Orchomenus was marching to meet Cleomenes, however, Antigonus broke camp and ordered a forced march; this caught the city by surprise and forced it to surrender. Antigonus proceeded to capture Mantinea, Heraea and Telphusa, which confined Cleomenes to Laconia.<ref name="Polybius 2.54">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.54 2.54]</ref><ref name="Plutarch23">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 23</ref> Antigonus then returned to Aegium, where he gave another report about his operations before dismissing the Macedonian troops to winter at home.<ref name="Polybius 2.54">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.54 2.54]</ref>

Knowing that Cleomenes got the money to pay for his mercenaries from Ptolemy, Antigonus, according to Peter Green, seems to have ceded some territory in [[Asia Minor]] to Ptolemy in return for Ptolemy withdrawing his financial support of Sparta. Whether this assumption is accurate or not, Ptolemy certainly withdrew his support, which left Cleomenes without money to pay for his mercenaries.<ref name="Green260">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 260</ref> Desperate for money, Cleomenes freed all [[helots]] able to pay five Attic minae; in this way he accumulated 500 talents of silver.<ref name="Plutarch23">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 23</ref><ref name="Green260">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 260</ref> He also armed 2,000 of the ex-helots in Macedonian style to counter the White Shields, the Macedonian crack troops, before planning a major initiative.<ref name="Plutarch23">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 23</ref>

Cleomenes noted that Antigonus had dismissed his Macedonian troops and only traveled with his mercenaries. At the time Antigonus was in Aegium, a three day march from Megalopolis. Most of the Achaeans of military age had been killed at Mount Lycaeum and Ladoceia.<ref name="Polybius 2.55">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.55 2.55]</ref> Cleomenes ordered his army to take five days' worth of rations and sent his troops toward [[Sellasia]], to give the appearance of raiding the territory of Argos.<ref name="Plutarch23">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 23</ref> From there he went to the territory of Megalopolis; during the night he ordered one of his friends, Panteus, to capture the weakest section of the walls, while Cleomenes and the rest of the army followed. Panteus managed to capture that section of the wall after killing the sentries. This allowed Cleomenes and the rest of the Spartan army to enter the city.<ref name="Plutarch23">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 23</ref>

When dawn came, the Megalopolitans realised that the Spartans had entered the city; some of them fled Megalopolis, while others stood and fought against the invaders.<ref name="Plutarch24">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 24</ref> Cleomenes' superior numbers forced the defenders to retreat, but their rearguard action allowed most of the population to escape – only 1,000 were captured.<ref name="Polybius 2.55">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.55 2.55]</ref> Cleomenes sent a message to [[Messene]], where the exiles had gathered, offering to give back their city if they became his allies. The Megalopolitans refused; in retaliation the Spartans ransacked the city and burnt it to the ground.<ref name="Plutarch24">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 24</ref> Nicholas Hammond estimated that Cleomenes managed to accumulate around 300 talents of loot from the city.<ref name="Hammond326">Hammond, ''The Macedonian State: Origins, Institutions and History'', 326</ref>

== Battle of Sellasia ==
The capture of Megalopolis shook the Achaean League. Cleomenes set off with his army to raid the territory of Argos, knowing that Antigonus would not resist him due to a lack of men. Cleomenes also hoped that his raid would cause the Argives to lose confidence in Antigonus because of his failure to protect their territory.<ref name="Polybius 2.64">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.64 2.64]</ref>

In the summer of 222 BC, Antigonus summoned his troops from Macedon, who arrived together with other allied forces. According to Polybius, the Macedonian army consisted of:

Cleomenes had fortified all the passes into Laconia with [[barricades]] and [[trenches]] before setting off with his army of 20,000 men to the pass at [[Sellasia]]. Overlooking the pass at Sellasia were two hills, Evas and Olympus. Cleomenes positioned his brother with the allied troops and the Perioeci on Evas; he stationed himself on Olympus with 6,000 Spartan hoplites and 5,000 mercenaries.<ref name="Polybius 2.65">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.65 2.65]</ref>

When Antigonus reached Sellasia with his army, he found it well guarded and decided against storming the strong position. Instead he pitched [[camp]] near Sellasia and waited for several days. During this time, he sent scouts to [[reconnoiter]] the areas and feign attacks on Cleomenes' position.<ref name="Polybius 2.66">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.66 2.66]</ref>

Unable to force a move from Cleomenes, Antigonus decided to risk a pitched battle. He positioned some of his Macedonian infantry and [[Illyrians]] facing the Evas hill. The Epirots, the Acarnanians and 2,000 Achaean infantry stood behind them as reinforcements. The cavalry took a position opposite Cleomenes' cavalry, with 1,000 Achaean and Megalopolitan infantry in reserve. Together with the rest of his Macedonian infantry and mercenaries Antigonus took his position opposite that of Cleomenes.<ref name="Polybius 2.66">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.66 2.66]</ref>

[[Image:Phalanx.jpg|300px|right|thumb|A drawing of a Macedonian phalanx, similar to the one that fought at the Battle of Sellasia]]

The battle started when the Illyrian troops on the Macedonian right wing attacked the Spartan force on Evas. The Spartan light infantry and cavalry, noticing that the Achaean infantry was not protected at the rear, launched an assault on the back of the Macedonian right wing, and threatened to route it.<ref name="Polybius 2.67">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.67 2.67]</ref> However, at the critical moment, [[Philopoemon]] of Megalopolis (who later became one of the greatest heroes of the Achaean League, eventually conquering Sparta), tried to point out the danger to the senior cavalry commanders. When they did not take notice of him, Philopoemon gathered a few other cavalrymen and charged the Spartan cavalry. The Spartans attacking from the rear broke off their engagement with the enemy, which encouraged the Macedonians to charge at the Spartan positions. The Spartan left flank was eventually forced back and thrown from their position; they fled the field.<ref name="Polybius 2.68">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.68 2.68]</ref>

Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on the left [[flank]] engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries.<ref name="Polybius 2.69">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.69 2.69]</ref> The Macedonians had 32 ranks instead of the usual 16.<ref name="Hammond326">Hammond, ''The Macedonian State: Origins, Institutions and History'', 326</ref> At the initial assault the Macedonian phalanx gave a considerable amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by the larger Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape with a small group of men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; most of their army was routed. Of the 6,000 Spartans that fought, only 200 were still living at the end of the battle.<ref name="Polybius 2.69">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.69 2.69]</ref><ref name="Plutarch28">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 28</ref>

== Aftermath ==
Following his defeat at Sellasia, Cleomenes briefly returned to Sparta and urged the citizens to accept Antigonus' terms.<ref name="William Smith">Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=entry%3D%234662;layout=;loc= Cleomenes III]"</ref><ref name="Plutarch29">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 29</ref> Under cover of darkness, he fled from Sparta with some friends and went to the city's port of [[Gythium]], where he boarded a ship heading to Egypt.<ref name="Polybius 2.69">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.69 2.69]</ref><ref name="Plutarch29">Plutarch, ''Life of Cleomenes'', 29</ref><ref name="Green261">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 261</ref>

== Notes ==
{{Cnote|a|The position of the ephors was first introduced in Sparta according to Plutarch in 700 BC by King [[Theopompus (king of Sparta)|Theopompus]].  The ephors were five men who were elected annually by the Spartan assembly and once they held the post once they could not do so again.<ref name="Plutarch7">Plutarch, ''Plutarch on Sparta'', 7</ref> The ephors looked after the day to day running of the state and where the arbiters of war and peace. The position was created to check and restrain the power of the King.<ref name="Lempiere252">Lempiere, ''Classical Dictionary'', 252</ref>}}

In the Achaean League, the position of strategus was the highest. A strategus was elected annually by the Achaean ekklesia or assembly and he was the lead general of the League for the year as well as the chief magistrate. Someone could not hold the position for more than one year.<ref name="Yonch and Shatzman434">Yonch and Shatzman, ''Illustrated Encyclopaedia of the Classical World'', 434</ref>
