As [[European Commissioner for Multilingualism]] in the Barroso Commission, Orban is responsible for the [[languages of the European Union|language policy of the European Union]], i.e. promoting [[multilingualism]] for the citizens  and the institutions of the [[European Union]]. He is the first to hold this [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]]. Multilingualism was previously a responsibility of the [[European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism]], [[Ján Figeľ]], the first Commissioner whose portfolio explicitly included multilingualism.

Politically, the portfolio is focused on promoting [[language learning|foreign languages learning]],<ref name=Communication>''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&lg=en&type_doc=COMfinal&an_doc=2005&nu_doc=596 Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the Regions - A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism]'' COM(2005) 596 final, [[November 22]], [[2005]].

Though awareness for [[linguistic diversity]] is a policy target, the [[language rights]] of speakers of [[Regional language|regional]], [[Minority language|minority]], lesser-used and migrant languages are not legally protected. In the European Union, [[language policy]] is the responsibility of member states and European Union does not have a "common language policy." Based on the "principle of [[subsidiarity]]", European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in their language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html#anArt150 Consolidated version of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Articles 149 to 150], ''Official Journal C 321E of 29 December 2006''.

Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes, protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the member states. Orban is also responsible for the effective functioning of the European Union's extensive [[interpretation]], [[translation]] and [[publication]] services in the 23 official languages of the Union. Language policy affects the overall European Union strategy of communication with its citizens and the effort to establish a European identity.<ref name="statement">Leonard Orban, [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/commission/2006_enlarg/speeches/speech_orban_en.pdf Introductory statement - European Parliament Hearing], (PDF) ''European Parliament website'', [[November 27]], [[2006]].

In [[October 30]], [[2006]], in agreement with the President of the Commission, Barroso, the Romanian government nominated Leonard Orban as Commissioner designate for Romania. Barroso assigned him the portfolio of multilingualism. Before Orban, [[Varujan Vosganian]], the current Romanian [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] [[Ministry of Economy and Commerce of Romania|Minister of Economy and Commerce]], had been nominated, but withdrew his candidature due to allegations concerning his past involvement with the secret police under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]] and party financing by a tycoon. National Liberal Party foreign minister [[Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu]] refused a nomination.<ref name="nomination"/><ref>[http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/romania-proposes-new-commissioner-candidate/article-159271 Romania proposes new commissioner candidate], ''EurActiv.com'', [[October 30]], [[2006]].

The assignment of the multilingualism portfolio to the Romanian Commissioner by Barroso was highly controversial. Barroso was severely criticized for creating a new Commissioner portfolio so that the accessing countries in 2007 could hold a post.  The portfolio was criticized for being too "light" for such a high-rank official, that there would be an overlap of responsibilities with other Commissioners and the good functioning of the Commission would be endangered. The portfolio was considered insubstantial for a Commissioner due to the limited jurisdiction of the EU in affecting language policy and the more administrative (rather than political character) of the post. In addition, it appeared that the portfolio had been created to complete a 27-strong Commission; Romania's appointment of a technocrat rather than a politician, given the country's deficits in interior and justice policies, especially in terms of corruption, would result in the Romanian Commissioner taking a degraded portfolio. This criticism came from the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), Romania's main opposition party,<ref>[http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=world_news&month=november2006&file=world_news2006110224558.xml Romanian oppn wants better EU portfolio], ''The Peninsula'' (Reuters), [[November 2]], [[2006]].

Orban said that he intended to spearhead the Commission's work on a portfolio that has become more important with every [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] and assured the [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] that his portfolio was a substantial one, covering a range of important political and managerial responsibilities. He also described how his portforlio would contribute to economic [[competitiveness]], the social dimension of the EU and the intercultural dialogue and stated that it would provide a forum for European political dialogue.<ref name="statement"/>

Orban told the Committee that the multilingual dimension of the EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes and should not be seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, "Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the [[internal market]]: [[Cultural policies of the European Union|culture]], [[Education in the European Union|education]] and competitiveness."<ref name="statement"/> In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [... but] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism."<ref name="statement"/> According to Orban, multilingualism promotes [[labour mobility]], [[tolerance]] and a sense of [[European citizenship]] and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy.<ref name="statement"/> Within the [[Lisbon Strategy|Lisbon strategy]], the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient.<ref name="statement"/> To address this, Orban aims to improve [[language teaching]] and to make the media and new [[Information technology|communication technologies]] more language-friendly. He underlined that, "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]."<ref name="statement"/> He added that, "The promotion of language learning and [[linguistic diversity]] is a general objective of the new [[EU Integrated programme|programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007]]. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union as well as to the languages of the EU's main trading partners."<ref name="statement"/> Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against [[discrimination]] on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, "Europe's linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted," which presumably includes all languages, [[national language|national]], [[regional language|regional]], [[minority language|minority]] and [[migrant language|migrant]].<ref name="statement"/> However, Orban agreed that the protection of [[language rights]] was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, "When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States."<ref name="summary of hearing"/>

Orban's remit includes the development of the European Indicator of Language Competence, the creation of a Business Forum on Multilingualism and a [[translation]] contest between schools from all over Europe as part of the events marking the 50th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]].<ref name="statement"/> In addition to the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013 and other educational and cultural programmes, Orban will promote multilingualism within other relevant policies and programmes, including the [[Seventh Framework Programme|Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development]], the [[European Social Fund]] and [[immigration]] initiatives.<ref name="statement"/> He also intends to contribute to the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, where multilingualism plays a fundamental part.<ref name="statement"/> On planning further policy, Orban promised to, "carefully analyse the results from the Action Plan for the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity, the recommendations from the High Level Group on Multilingualism and the activities of the Commission internal network for multilingualism. Before the end of 2007, I would organise a [[Council of the European Union|Ministerial conference]] to discuss the way forward. I would then propose a new Action Plan in 2008 to continue work in this area."<ref name="statement"/>

His views on multilingualism fall in line with the current European Union language policy as described in the Communication from the Commission "A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism" on [[November 22]], [[2005]].<ref name="Communication"/>
