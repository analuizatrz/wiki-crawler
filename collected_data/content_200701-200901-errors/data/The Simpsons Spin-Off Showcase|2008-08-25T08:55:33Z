"'''The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase'''" is the twenty fourth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on [[May 11]], [[1997]].<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00-638898-1|pages=p. 228}}</ref> The episode centers on fictional [[pilot episode]]s of non-existent [[television series]] derived from ''The Simpsons'', and is a parody of the tendency of network executives to try to find any reason to [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] characters from a hit series. As such it includes references to many different TV series. The first fictional spin-off is ''Chief Wiggum P.I.'', a cop-drama featuring [[Chief Wiggum]] and [[Seymour Skinner]]. The second is ''The Love-matic Grampa'', a sitcom featuring [[Moe Szyslak]] who receives dating advice from [[Abraham Simpson]], whose ghost is possessing a love testing machine. The final segment is ''The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour'', a variety show featuring the [[Simpson family]] except for Lisa, who has been replaced. 

The episode was written by [[David X. Cohen|David S. Cohen]], [[Dan Greaney]] and [[Steve Tompkins]], with [[Ken Keeler]] coming up with the story and the general idea of intentionally bad writing. It was directed by [[Neil Affleck]],<ref name="book"/> and [[Tim Conway]], [[Gailard Sartain]] and [[Phil Hartman]] guest starred.<ref name="book"/><ref name="BBC">{{citeweb|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season8/page24.shtml|title=The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase|accessdate=2007-02-15||author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as they feared that the purposely bad writing would pass off as actual bad writing. The episode, however, now figures on several lists of the most popular ''The Simpsons'' episodes.

==Plot==
[[Troy McClure]] hosts a television special from the museum of television introducing three spin-offs productions, created using characters from ''The Simpsons''. The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] only has three filled slots for the next season and so commissions the producers of ''The Simpsons'' to create thirty-five new shows. The producers instead decided to create just three new shows.

'''''Chief Wiggum, P.I.''''' is a cop-drama spin-off, which follows [[Chief Wiggum]], [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] and [[Seymour Skinner]]. Chief Wiggum and his son Ralph move to [[New Orleans]] with Seymour Skinner as Wiggum's sidekick. Wiggum has proclaimed that he will "clean up the city" of New Orleans, but it doesn't take long before he meets his nemesis, Big Daddy, who warns Wiggum to stay out of his business. After they have experienced the [[Mardi Gras]], Ralph is kidnapped by Big Daddy. Wiggum tracks him down and the two people chase each other to Big Daddy's house. Chief Wiggum then threatens Big Daddy with a gun and he gives back Ralph and swims away in the water. He ultimately lets the villain escape, feeling that he will meet him again the following week "in a more exciting and sexy way".  

'''''The Love-matic Grampa''''' is a [[sitcom]]-style television series about [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'s love life.  He receives advice from the [[ghost]] of [[Abraham Simpson]], who was crushed by a store shelf containing cans of figs that toppled on him and subsequently "got lost on his way up to Heaven" and now possesses Moe's [[Love Tester]] machine.  Moe ends up getting a date he meets at the bar. On Granpa's advice he takes his date out to a French restaurant and hides the Love Tester on the toilet, so he can get advice while at the restaurant. His dependence on the machine is revealed, and he confesses to receiving advice.  His date is actually happy when she hears this, flattered that Moe would go to all that trouble for her. After taking the device, [[Kearney (Simpsons)|Kearney]], [[Dolph (Simpsons)|Dolph]] and other thugs whack the machine because it said they were [[gay]].

'''''The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour''''' is a [[comedy]] show featuring various [[songs]] and sketches. It features Homer, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]].  [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] refuses to participate, but is replaced by an attractive [[blonde]] [[bombshell]]. After the introduction there is a sketch, where  the family are portrayed as beavers living in a [[dam]] with [[Tim Conway]] as a [[skunk]] and Homer's boss. The show ends with a medley of songs sung by the family, [[Jasper Beardley]] and [[Waylon Smithers]]. 

Troy ends the special with a look at the upcoming season of ''The Simpsons'', filled with ridiculous plot twists, such as Homer turning Lisa into a frog using magic powers, the discovery of Bart's two long lost identical brothers, [[Selma Bouvier|Selma]] marrying [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]], [[Bumblebee Man]], and [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy]], and Homer meeting an alien named Ozmodiar that only he can see.

==Production==
[[Image:Tim Conway cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tim Conway]] appears as himself in the episode's third segment.]]
[[Ken Keeler]] came up with the idea for the episode from the one sentence statement: "Let's do spin-offs".<ref name="Kencom">{{cite video | people=Keeler, Ken|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> His idea was to use intentionally bad writing and "crazy plots", which underlines their critique of spin-offs in general.<ref name="al1st">Alberti, pp. 155-156</ref> After he had pitched the idea it was decided that "it was an idea that ought to work pretty well" and production went ahead.<ref name="Kencom"/> Creator [[Matt Groening]] was uneasy about the idea, feeling that it could be mistranslated as actually bad sitcom writing. He also did not like the idea of breaking the [[fourth wall]] and the concept of saying that the Simpsons were just actors in a television show.<ref name="Mattcom">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The idea was later explored in the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|season 11]] episode "[[Behind the Laughter]]".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Behind the Laughter|episodelink=Behind the Laughter
|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Long, Tim; Meyer, George; Scully, Mike; Kirkland, Mark|network=Fox |airdate=2000-05-21|season=11|number=248}}</ref> One of the "crazy" ideas was the inclusion of the character of Ozmodiar, who was originally included in the script for an earlier episode but was considered too ridiculous for the time. When this episode came along the character seemed to fit with the story and was included.<ref name="Joshcom">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh |year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Even though Keeler came up with the story, David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins wrote the scripts for the three segments.<ref name="BBC"/> Cohen wrote ''Chief Wiggum P.I.'',<ref name="Cohencom">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X.|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Greaney wrote ''Love-matic Grampa'' and Tompkins wrote ''The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour''.<ref>{{cite video | people=Greaney, Dan |year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The episode demanded a different approach to directing than a usual ''The Simpsons'' episode. Director [[Neil Affleck]] had to animate each segment so that it fitted the style of the show it parodied. ''The Love-matic Grampa'' segment for instance emulates a three camera setup, as is normally used in sitcoms.<ref name="Kencom"/>

Three guest stars appear in the episode; [[Phil Hartman]] as [[Troy McClure]], [[Tim Conway]] as himself and [[Gailard Sartain]] as Big Daddy.<ref name="BBC"/> McClure is used as a host of the episode, something he had previously done in the episode "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]".<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular|episodelink=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, John; Silverman, David; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1995-12-03 |season=7 |number=138}}</ref> Conway appears as himself. Conway, a comic veteran, is known for his work on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', which has a similar format to ''The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour''.<ref name="al3rd">Alberti, pp. 158-159</ref> Due to Lisa being substituted for an older teenager in the third segment, [[Yeardley Smith]] only has one line in the entire episode.<ref name="Yeardleycom">{{cite video | people=Smith, Yeardley |year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Proposed real spin-offs===
Over the course of the show, the staff have considered producing several spin-off television series and films, based on ''The Simpsons''. In 1994, [[Matt Groening]] pitched a [[live action]] spin-off from ''The Simpsons'' that centered on Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta. He and Michael Weithorn<ref name="empire">{{cite news | author = Olly Richards | title = Life In Development Hell | pages = 76 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2007-05-24]] | accessdate = 2007-10-19}}</ref>  wrote a pilot script where Krusty moved to [[Los Angeles]] and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by [[American beaver|beavers]]. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to stop work on the project.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84306,00.html|title=Send in the Clown|accessdate=2008-04-04|date=[[1999-04-15]]|author=Dan Snierson|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref>

"[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]" sparked the idea amongst the staff for a spin-off series entitled ''Tales from Springfield''. The proposed show would focus on the town in general, rather than the Simpson family. Every week would be a different scenario: three short stories, an adventure with young Homer or a story about a background character that was not tied in to the Simpson family at all.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The idea never came to anything, as Groening realized that the staff did not have the manpower to produce another show as well as ''The Simpsons''.<ref name="empire"/> The staff believe it is something that they would still be interested in doing,<ref>{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and that "could happen someday."<ref name="empire"/> 

Groening also expressed a wish to make ''Simpstasia'', a parody of ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''; it was never produced, partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature-length script.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[A Streetcar Named Marge]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Before his death, [[Phil Hartman]] had said he had wished to make a live action [[Troy McClure]] film, and several of the show's staff had expressed a desire to help create it.<ref>{{cite video|people=Oakley, Bill|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homerpalooza]]"|medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Matt Groening]] later told ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' that the idea never "got further than enthusiasm", but "would have been really fun".<ref name="empire"/>

==Cultural references==
[[Image:Ozmodiar.png|thumb|right|200px|A small green alien called Ozmodiar, that only Homer can see, was inserted as a reference to [[The Great Gazoo]] from [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[The Flintstones]]''.]]
The whole episode is a satire of unoriginal, poor television writing and references and parodies many TV shows. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots for the next season, the three shows are ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', and ''[[The X-Files]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> On the museum of television Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as ''[[The Ropers]]'' (spun off from ''[[Three's Company]]''), ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]'' (spun off from ''[[Happy Days]]''), ''[[Rhoda]]'' (spun off from ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'')<ref name="BBC"/> and ''[[Fish (TV series)|Fish]]'' (spun off from ''[[Barney Miller]]''),<ref name="al154">Alberti, p. 154</ref> to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (a spin-off of ''[[All in the Family]]'') twice, because the writers could not think of any more spin-offs.<ref name="Joshcom"/>

''Chief Wiggum, P.I.'' is a parody of police-dramas, such as ''[[Miami Vice]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' and ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]''. Skinner emulates Don Johnson from ''Miami Vice'' in order to look scruffier.<ref name="al1st"/> The character of Big Daddy is based on [[Dr. John]], who comes from [[New Orleans]].<ref name="Cohencom"/>

''The Love-matic Grampa'' is a parody of sitcoms such as ''[[Mister Ed]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[Bewitched]]''<ref name="BBC"/> as well as having similarities to ''[[My Mother the Car]]''.<ref name="Mattcom"/> The Love-matic Grampa machine singing "[[Daisy Bell]]" in a distorted manner when its electrical circuits are failing is a reference to [[HAL 9000|HAL]] from the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> Grampa also references ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', when Moe says he "wrote the book on love".<ref name="al2nd"/> Moe's date, Betty, looks somewhat like [[Tress MacNeille]], the actress who voiced her.<ref name="Yeardleycom"/>

''The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour'' is a parody of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is a parody of ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour]]'', an short-lived spin-off of the 1970s sitcom ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''.  The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of [[Jan Brady]] in the ''Brady Bunch Hour'' when [[Eve Plumb]] refused to participate.<ref name="al2nd">Alberti, pp. 156-157</ref> The Simpson family is made to look like ''[[The Partridge Family]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> Also, the segment holds numerous references to ''[[Laugh-In]]''. [[Kent Brockman]] introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to ''Laugh-In'', there is a joke wall similar to the one in ''Laugh-In'' where [[The Sea Captain]] opens a pothole. There is also a ''Laugh-In''-like montage wherein other characters comments on the skit itself.<ref name="al3rd"/> When [[Hans Moleman]] reads a poem, it is based on [[Henry Gibson]] reading a poem on ''Laugh-In''.<ref name="Joshcom"/> Other shows parodied during the variety show include ''[[The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]]'',<ref name="Yeardleycom"/> and ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''.<ref name="al3rd"/>

The songs parodied during the third segment are:
* "[[I Want Candy]]" by [[The Strangeloves]], performed by the Simpson family.<ref name="BBC"/>
* "[[Peppermint Twist]]" by Joey Dee and the Starlighters, performed by [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]].<ref name="BBC"/>
* "[[Lollipop (1950s pop song)|Lollipop]]" by [[The Chordettes]], performed by [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Jasper Beardly|Jasper Beardley]].<ref name="BBC"/>
* "[[Whip It]]" by [[Devo]], performed by [[Waylon Smithers]].<ref name="BBC"/>

In the planned future for the show, Homer meets an green space alien named Ozmodiar that only he can see. This is a reference to [[The Great Gazoo]], a character added into some of the final episodes of ''[[The Flintstones]]''.<ref name="al160">Alberti, p. 160</ref>

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase" finished 61st place in the weekly ratings for the week of May 5–[[May 11]], [[1997]] with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 7.3. It was the seventh highest rated show on the [[Fox Network]] that week. Even though Troy mentions that ''The Simpsons'', ''Melrose Place'', and ''The X-Files'' are the only shows worth a slot in the next season's lineup, three other Fox shows actually did better than ''The Simpsons'' that week. These were ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', and ''[[Married… with Children]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Prime-time Ratings|date=[[May 14]], [[1997]]|accessdate=2008-06-26|page=F02|publisher=[[The Orange County Register]]}}</ref>

This episode split the fans into two groups. One group that loved it and another one who hated it. The question was if they understood that they were intentionally having bad writing in order to parody bad writing.<ref name="Joshcom"/> Matt Groening feared that the fans would interpret the episode in a negative light and was uneasy about the episode when it was in production. He later went on to say that the episode "turned out great".<ref name="Mattcom"/> The writers of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'' Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood called it, "A very clever spin on the alternates offered by the Treehouse of Horrors run. Each of the spin-offs is very clever in its own way."<ref name="BBC"/> It has also figured as one of the most favorite episodes on a number of "best of" lists. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' placed the episode 19th in their top 25 Simpsons episode list.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_4,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|date=[[2003-02-06]]|accessdate=2007-02-02|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> In an interview for ''Star-News'', ''The Simpsons'' writer [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]] revealed that the episode was in his personal top six of the best ''The Simpsons'' episodes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wilmington Walk of Fame 'Simpsons' writer Don Payne - Master of his D'oh-main Don Payne left the Port City years ago for Springfield, but he'll always be a celebrity in his hometown|author=Ballard, Allison|publisher|Star-News (Wilmington, NC)|date=[[August 21]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2008-06-28|page=1D, 5D}}</ref> Additionally, Gary Mullinax, a staff writer for ''[[The News Journal]]'', picked the episode as part of his top-ten list.<ref>{{cite news|title=Homer's Odyssey|author=Mullinax, Gary |publisher|[[The News Journal]]|date=[[March 16]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2008-06-28|page=14, 15, 16H}}</ref>
