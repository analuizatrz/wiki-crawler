'''Karnātakā''' {{audio|Karnataka.ogg|pronunciation}} ([[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ಕನಾ೯ಟಕ) ({{IPA2|kəɹnɑːʈəkɑː}}) is one of the four [[South India|southern]] [[States and territories of India|state]]s of [[India]].  The state was [[Unification of Karnataka|created]] in 1956 with the passing of the [[States Reorganisation Act]].  Originally named ''[[Mysore State|State of Mysore]]'', it was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973.  It is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the  north, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the southwest. The state covers an area of 191,791 km² or 5.83% of the total geographical area of India.  It is the [[List of states of India by area|eighth largest Indian state by area]], [[List of states of India by population|the ninth largest by population]] and comprises 29 [[Districts of India|districts]].  [[Kannada language|Kannada]] is the official and most widely spoken language.

Though [[Origin of Karnataka's name|several etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that ''Karnataka'' is derived from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''nādu'', meaning ''elevated land''. ''Karu nadu'' may also be read as ''Karu'' (black) and ''nadu'' (region), as a reference to the [[Vertisol|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayaluseeme]] region of Karnataka. During the [[British Raj]], the word ''Carnatic'' or ''Karnatak'' was used to describe this part of the region in general. 

With an antiquity that dates to the [[paleolithic]], Karnataka has also been home to [[Political history of medieval Karnataka |some of the most powerful empires of ancient India]]. Great philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements whose ennobling effects have been felt far and wide. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the [[Carnatic music |Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani music |Hindustani]] traditions. Writers in the Kannada language have received the most number of [[Jnanpith|Jnanpith awards]] in India.  [[Bangalore]], also known as Bengalūru, is the capital city of the state and is at the forefront of the rapid economic and technological development that India is experiencing.


==History==
[[Image:Belur4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hoysala Empire]] architecture in [[Belur]]]]
{{main|History of Karnataka|Political history of medieval Karnataka|Origin of Karnataka's name}}
The history of Karnataka can be traced back to a [[paleolithic]] hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region. Evidence of [[neolithic]] and [[megalithic]] cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in [[Harappa]] was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesize about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in 3000 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070121024542/http://metalrg.iisc.ernet.in/~wootz/heritage/K-hertage.htm|title=THE Golden Heritage of Karnataka|author=S.

Four centuries of [[Satavahana Dynasty|Satavahana]] rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the [[Kadambas]] and the [[Western Gangas]], marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The [[Kadamba Dynasty]], founded by [[Mayurasharma]], had its capital at [[Banavasi]];<ref name="origin">From the Talagunda inscription (Dr. B. L.

At the turn of the first millennium, the [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]] gained power in the region. [[Hoysala architecture|Art and architecture]] flourished during this time, which led to the distinctive Kannada [[meter (music)|literary metres]] and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the [[Hoysala architecture|Vesara style of architecture]].<ref name="sang1">Kamath (2001), pp132–134</ref><ref name="sang">Sastri (1955), pp. 358-9, p 361</ref><ref name="chenna">Foekema (1996), p14</ref><ref name="chenna1">Kamath (2001), pp. 122-4</ref> The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought parts of modern [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] under its rule. In the early 14th century, [[Harihara]] and [[Bukka Raya]] established the [[Vijayanagara empire]] with its capital, ''Hosapattana'' (later named [[Vijayanagara]]), on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries.<ref name="vij">Kamath 2001, pp. 157–160</ref><ref name="vij1">Kulke and Rothermund (2004), p188</ref> 

In 1565, Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara Empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the [[Battle of Talikota]].<ref name="bin">Kamath (2001), pp. 190-191</ref> The [[Bijapur Sultanate]], which had risen after the demise of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] of Bidar, soon took control of the Deccan; it was defeated by the [[Moghul empire|Moghuls]] in the late 17th century.<ref name="conf">Kamath (2001), p201</ref><ref name="erst">Kamath (2001), p202</ref> The Bahamani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style.<ref name="gol">Kamath (2001), p207</ref>   
[[Image:GolGumbaz2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gol Gumbaz]] at [[Bijapur]]]]
In the period that followed, parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the [[Maratha empire|Marathas]], the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], the [[British India|British]], and other powers. In the south, the [[Wodeyar|Mysore Wodeyars]], former [[vassal]]s of the Vijayanagara Empire, were briefly independent.<ref name="ind">Kamath (2001), p171</ref> With the death of [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar II]], [[Haidar Ali]], the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region.

As the "[[doctrine of lapse]]" gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country, [[Kittur Chennamma]], [[Sangolli Rayanna]] and others spearheaded rebellions in Karnataka in 1830, nearly three decades before the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Other uprisings followed, such as the ones at [[Supa]], [[Bagalkot]], [[Shorapur]], [[Nargund]] and [[Dandeli]]. These rebellions which coincided with the 1857 war of independence were led by [[Mundargi Bhimarao]], [[Bhaskar Rao Bhave]], the [[Halagali Beda uprising|Halagali Bedas]], [[Venkatappa Nayaka]] and others. By the late 19th century, the freedom movement had gained momentum; [[Karnad Sadashiva Rao]], [[Aluru Venkata Raya]], [[S. Nijalingappa]], [[Kengal Hanumanthaiah]] and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/May202007/sundayherald200705192574.asp|title=The rising in the south|work=Online Edition of The Deccan Herald, dated 2007-05-20|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=The Printers (Mysore) Private Limited|author=Suryanath Kamath}}</ref>

After India's independence, the Maharaja, [[Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar]], allowed his kingdom's accession to India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name; the former Maharaja served as its ''Rajpramukh'' (head of state) until 1975.  Following the long-standing demand of the  [[Unification of Karnataka|Ekikarana Movement]], Kodagu and Kannada speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the [[States Reorganization Act]] of 1956. The thus expanded state was renamed  Karnataka, seventeen years later, in 1973.<ref name="Unification">{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/images/Rajyotsava12352120051031.asp|title=History in the making|work=Online Edition of The Deccan Herald, dated 2005-11-01|author=Prem Paul Ninan|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Karnataka|Rainfall in Karnataka}}
The state has three principal geographical zones: the coastal region of [[Karavali]], the hilly [[Malnad]] region comprising the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Bayaluseeme]] region comprising the plains of the [[Deccan plateau]]. The bulk of the state is in the Bayaluseeme region, the northern part of which is the second largest [[arid]] region in [[India]].<ref name="arid"> {{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1817/18170420.htm|author=Parvathi Menon|title=Karnataka's agony|work=Online Edition of the Frontline, Volume 18 - Issue 17, Aug. 18 - 31, 2001|publisher=Frontline|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> The highest point in Karnataka is the [[Mullayanagiri]] hills in [[Chikkamagaluru district]] which has an altitude of {{convert|1929|m|ft|0|lk=on}}.

Karnataka consists of four main types of geological formations<ref name="geology">{{cite web|url=http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/paper/TR109/TR109_TVR.pdf|author=Ramachandra T.V. and Kamakshi G.|title=Bioresource Potential of Karnataka|work=Technical Report No. 109, November 2005|publisher=Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore|accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> — the ''[[Archean]] complex'' made up of [[Dharwad]] [[schist]]s and granitic [[gneiss]]es, the ''[[Proterozoic]]'' non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the ''Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits'' and the tertiary and recent [[laterite]]s and alluvial deposits.  Significantly, about 60% of the state is comprised of the ''Archean complex'' which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks.  Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the [[Deccan Traps]] were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. [[Entisol]]s, [[Inceptisols]], [[Mollisol]]s, [[Spodosol]]s, [[Alfisol]]s, [[Ultisol]]s, [[Oxisol]]s, [[Aridisol]]s, [[Vertisol]]s, [[Andisol]]s and [[Histosol]]s.<ref name="geology"/> Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. Red, [[Lateritic soil|lateritic]], [[Black soil|black]], alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.

Karnataka experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May, the monsoon season between June and September and the post-monsoon season from October till December. [[Meteorology|Meteorologically]], Karnataka is divided into three zones — coastal, north interior and south interior. Of these, the coastal zone receives the heaviest rainfall with an average rainfall of about {{convert|3638.5|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=on|0}} per annum, far in excess of the state average of {{convert|1139|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}. [[Agumbe]] in the [[Shivamogga district]] receives the second highest annual rainfall in India.<ref name="second"> Agumbe's receiving the second highest rainfall in India is mentioned by {{cite web|url=http://www.centralchronicle.com/20070328/2803302.htm|title=Link Godavari, Krishna & Cauvery|author=Arabinda Ghose|work=Online Edition of the Central Chronicle, dated 2007-03-28|publisher=2007, Central Chronicle|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|45.6|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=on|0}} at [[Raichur]] and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|2.8|°C|°F|abbr=on|0}} at [[Bidar]].

About 38,724 km² of Karnataka (i.e. 20% of the state's geographic area) is covered by forests. The forests are classified as reserved, protected, unclosed, village and private forests. The percentage of forested area is slightly less than the all-India average of about 23%, and significantly less than the 33% prescribed in the National Forest Policy.

Each district is governed by a district commissioner or district magistrate. Each district is divided into sub-divisions, which are governed by sub-divisional magistrates; sub-divisions comprise blocks containing panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities.

As per the 2001 census, Karnataka's six largest cities sorted in order of decreasing population were, [[Bangalore]], [[Hubli]]-[[Dharwad]], [[Mysore]], [[Gulbarga]], [[Belgaum]] and [[Mangalore]]. Bangalore is the only city with a population of more than one million. [[Bangalore Urban]], [[Belgaum district|Belgaum]] and [[Gulbarga district|Gulbarga]] are the most populous districts, each of them having a population of more than three million. [[Gadag district|Gadag]], [[Chamarajanagar district|Chamarajanagar]] and [[Kodagu]] districts have a population of less than one million.

{{main|Art and culture of Karnataka|Carnatic Music|Cuisine of Karnataka}}

The diverse linguistic and religious ethnicities that are native to Karnataka combined with their long histories have contributed immensely to the varied cultural heritage of the state.  Apart from [[Kannadiga]]s, Karnataka is home to [[Tuluva]]s, [[Kodava]]s and [[Konkanis]].  Minor populations of [[Tibetan Buddhist]]s and tribes like the [[Soliga]]s, Yeravas, [[Toda]]s and [[Siddhis of Karnataka|Siddhis]] also live in Karnataka.  The [[Folk arts of Karnataka|traditional folk arts]] cover the entire gamut of music, dance, drama, storytelling by itinerant troupes, etc. [[Yakshagana]] of coastal Karnataka, a classical [[folk play]], is one of the major theatrical forms of Karnataka. Contemporary theatre culture in Karnataka remains vibrant with organizations like [[Ninasam]], [[Ranga Shankara]], [[Rangayana]] and [[Prabhat Kalavidaru]] continuing to build on the foundations laid by [[Gubbi Veeranna]], [[T. P. Kailasam]] and [[List_of_people_from_Karnataka#Theatre|others]]. [[Veeragase]], [[Kamsale]] and [[Dollu Kunitha]] are popular dance forms. [[Bharatanatyam|Bharatanatya]] also enjoys wide patronage in Karnataka.

Karnataka also has a special place in the world of Indian classical music with both [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani music|Hindustani]] styles finding place in the state and Karnataka has produced a number of [[List of people from Karnataka#Music|stalwarts in both styles]]. The [[Haridasa]] movement of the sixteenth century contributed seminally to the development of [[Carnatic music]] as a performing art form.  [[Purandara Dasa]], one of the most revered [[Haridasa]]s, is known as the ''Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha'' ('Father of Carnatic music').<ref name="father">{{cite web|title=Purandara Dasa|url=http://www.kamat.com/indica/faiths/bhakti/purandara.htm|author=Dr. Jytosna Kamat|publisher=Kamats Potpourri|work=|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> Celebrated Hindustani musicians like [[Gangubai Hangal]], [[Mallikarjun Mansur]], [[Bhimsen Joshi]] and [[List of people from Karnataka#Classical Music - Hindustani|several others]] hail from Karnataka and some of them have been recipients of the [[Kalidas Samman]], [[Padma Bhushan]] and [[Padma Vibhushan]] awards.

The three most important schools of Hindu philosophy, ''[[Advaita]]'', ''[[Vishistadvaita]]'' and ''[[Dvaita]]'' blossomed in Karnataka.  While [[Madhvacharya]] was born in Karnataka, [[Adi Shankaracharya]] chose [[Sringeri]] in Karnataka to establish the first of his four ''[[matha]]s''.  [[Ramanujacharya]], who fled persecution by the Cholas in modern Tamil Nadu, spent many years in [[Melkote]].<ref name="persecution">Fearing persecution by the Cholas who were staunch [[Shaiva]]ites, Ramanujacharya came to Karnataka in 1098 and lived there until 1122. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana Temple and a well organised [[Matha]] were built. He was patronized by the Hoysala king, Vishnuvardhana. (Kamath 2001), pp. 150-152</ref>  In the twelfth century, [[Veerashaivism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were [[Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]], who established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] where the philosophy of ''Shakti Vishishtadvaita'' was expounded. This was the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith which today counts millions among its followers.<ref name="basa">Kamath (2001), pp. 152-154</ref> The [[Jain]] philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. [[Islam]], which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka.<ref name="bam">Sastri (1955), p396</ref>  [[Christianity]] reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[St. Francis Xavier]] in 1545.<ref name="chris">Sastri (1955), p398</ref>  Buddhism was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as [[Gulbarga]] and [[Banavasi]]. A chance discovery of edicts and several [[Maurya]]n relics at Sannati in [[Gulbarga district]] in 1986 has proven that the Krishna River basin was once home to both [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Tulu, Kodava Takk and Konkani are other major native languages that share a long history in the state. [[Urdu]] is spoken widely by the [[Muslim]] population. Less widely spoken languages include [[Beary bashe]] and certain dialects such as [[Sankethi language|Sankethi]]. Kannada features a rich and ancient body of literature covering topics as diverse as [[Jainism]], [[Vachana]]s, and [[Haridasa|Haridasa Sahitya]]. Evidence from edicts during the time of [[Ashoka the Great]] suggest that the Kannada script and its literature were influenced by Buddhist literature. The [[Halmidi inscription]], the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, dates to 450 CE while the earliest available literary work, the [[Kavirajamarga]], has been dated to 850 CE. References made in the Kavirajamarga, however, prove that Kannada literature flourished in the ''Chattana'', ''Beddande'' and ''Melvadu'' metres during earlier centuries.<ref name="kavi5">Narasimhacharya (1988), p12, p17</ref> [[Kuvempu]], the renowned Kannada poet and writer who wrote [[Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate]], the state anthem of Karnataka<ref name="anthem">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/01/11/stories/2004011103410400.htm|title=Poem declared `State song'|work=Online webpage of The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2007-07-15}}</ref> was the first recipient of the "[[Karnataka Ratna]]" award, the highest civilian award bestowed by the [[Government of Karnataka]].
