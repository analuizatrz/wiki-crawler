'''West Virginia University''' is an institution of higher learning based in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], [[United States of America|USA]], with off-site campuses in [[West Virginia University at Parkersburg|Parkersburg]], [[West Virginia University Institute of Technology|Montgomery]], [[Potomac State College of West Virginia University|Keyser]] and [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]]. WVU was founded in [[1867]] as a [[land-grant university]] with the help of the [[Morrill Act]], and was originally called the "Agricultural College of West Virginia." The university gained its current name in [[1868]].  Enrollment for Fall semester of [[2005]] was 26,051 with school projections estimating enrollment reaching 30,000 before the year [[2010]].

The university offers 171 different majors in 13 different colleges and has produced 25 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], including current WVU president [[David C. Hardesty, Jr.]].  There are only 6 other public universities with more.  The university has also produced 29 Goldwater Scholars, 16 Truman Scholars, 5 members of USA Today's All-USA College Academic First Team, and 2 Udall Scholarship winners.

==Colleges and schools==

===Forensics program===
In addition to the above listed colleges/schools, WVU also has a nationally recognized [[forensic science]] program.  Originally created through a partnership with the [[FBI]], the program is fully accredited by the [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]] and is the official library holdings repository for the [[International Association for Identification]].

The program focuses on several aspects of forensics including:

*[[Forensic accounting]] and [[fraud]]
*[[Forensic entomology]]
*[[Bloodstain pattern analysis]] and Biological Evidence aging
*[[Criminology]] and Forensic Investigations
*[[Dactylography]] and Fractal Analysis of Fingerprints
*[[Forensic toxicology]]
*[[Forensic odontology]]
*[[Computer forensics]] and Database Research
*Forensic Textile Research

Forensic facilities include special "crime-scene" houses and vehicles that can be altered and adapted to give student investigators hands-on experience, as well as traditional laboratories and classrooms.

== Institutional advancements ==
In addition to the high technological advancements the university has made, there is currently over $800 million in new construction processes pending on the Morgantown campus. These include a joint venture with the [[Johns Hopkins University]] that involves the creation of a new research institute devoted solely to the study of human memory and neurological disease called the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute. The Institute [http://www.brni.org BRNI] will be housed in a state-of-the-art facility priced at $87 million. It is scheduled for completion in mid-2007.

The University has also received growing national recognition for its engineering programs. Upcoming projects include an engineering research park, advancements to the [[NASA]]/WVU IV&V Facility, as well as combined research with the Institute for Scientific Research [http://www.isr.us/], who is building its national research headquarters within 20 miles of WVU's Morgantown campus in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]] (A move from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]).

[[Image:WVRHClogo.gif|right|150px]]
Also located on campus is the [[West Virginia and Regional History Collection]], the world's largest collection of West Virginia related research material. It is located in the Wise Library on the Downton Campus.  According to the university, the collection includes over 4,500,000 [[manuscript]] documents, 30,000 books, 15,000 pamphlets, 1,200 [[newspapers]], 100,000 [[photographs]] and prints, 5,000 maps, and 25,000 [[microfilm]]s, [[oral histories]], films and [[folk music]] recordings. It is often called simply the "West Virginia Collection." 

The university co-publishes, with the [[United Association for Labor Education]], ''[[Labor Studies Journal]]''.

==Campus==
An interesting aspect of the West Virginia University campus is the fact that it is actually split into three smaller sections or sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is located in historic downtown Morgantown. Because expansion of the downtown area was virtually impossible, a newer campus, called the Evansdale Campus, was constructed in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] about a mile down the [[Monongahela River]] from the historic Downtown Campus on a high rise above the river. The third campus is the Health Sciences Campus, which, although located relatively close to Evansdale, functions as its own area (also lying well above the Monongahela Valley).

== PRT system ==
{{main|Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit}}
Because of the issue of WVU's split campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, Health Sciences) one of the major icons at the school is the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|Personal Rapid Transit]] system that links them.

In [[1974]], [[Boeing]] began construction on the major PRT project in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], designed to shuttle students between WVU's three campuses. The school's original main campus, the Downtown Campus, is located in the valley of the Monongahela River. The Evansdale Campus, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, is on a high rise directly above the river, taking it out of the flood plain, but still in the valley. Because it proved impossible to develop any more valley land, WVU expanded to a separate parcel a couple of miles away on the other side of a ridge (today's Health Sciences Campus).

The WVU PRT began operation in [[1975]]. There was an interruption in service during the 1978/1979 school year to allow system expansion from the Engineering station to new stations at the "Towers" dormitories and the WVU Medical Center. During this time, WVU provided bus service between the campuses.  The PRT handles about 16,000 riders per day (as of 2005). The system uses about 70 vehicles, with an advertised capacity of 20 people each (although a more practical number is more like 15). The system has five stations (Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical) and a 4 mile (6 km) track. The vehicles are rubber-tired and run along electrified rails. [[Steam]] heating keeps the elevated guide way free of snow and ice. Most students habitually use it. This system was not sold to other sites because the heated track has proven too expensive.  The system will occasionally break down, yet it is usually only for about ten minutes.  Otherwise, it reliably transports students between Downtown, Evansdale and Health Sciences. In order to board the PRT, one may either pay a fare of fifty cents, or swipe their Mountaineer Card, an ID that also acts as debit plan, library card and unlimited transit pass. The cars are blue with gold trim and the school logo, as well as the school name printed on the front of each. Inside, the seats are light beige [[fiberglass]] and the interior carpet is brown. As only eight seats are available per car, four in the front and rear, passengers are asked to give precedence to physically impaired or elderly riders.

The PRT has also been the recipient of favorable recognition.  The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] named the WVU PRT one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972, and in 1998 The New Electric Railway Journal picked the WVU PRT over [[PeopleMover|Walt Disney World's monorail]] as the greatest people mover in the United States.

Each autumn during the annual Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is brought in front of the [[MountainLair]] [[student activity center|student union]] where students participate in the "PRT Cram."  The purpose of the event is for student organizations to organize groups who attempt to squeeze as many people into the PRT car as possible.  The current record was set in [[2000]] with 97 people.

==Residential education==
[[Image:Boreman_Hall_South.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Boreman Hall]], one of the oldest residence halls on campus.]]
One of the flagship programs of the University is the Residential Education (ResEd) program also enacted in 1995.  This program works hand-in-hand with other University initiatives to promote a healthy and responsible living environment for students while focusing on academics and responsible decisions.  As part of '''Operation Jump-Start''', the current ResEd program focuses primarily on "promoting student success by easing the transition from high school to college and to personalize the freshman experience. [http://admissions.wvu.edu/undergraduate/discover/resident_faculty.asp]"  During the Move-In or Welcome Weekend, returning upperclassmen sometimes volunteer to help the new students and are known as Residential Education HOTSHOTS. They help carry in items, give directions, answer questions, and are easily spotted in their gold t-shirts. Other Operation Jump-Start programs include FallFest, WVUp All Night, Freshman Convocation, and the Festival of Ideas, a lecture series featuring different speakers.

Although a campus-wide plan, the ResEd and Operation Jump-Start programs are primarilly focused on [[residence halls]].  The 11 residence hall have an intricate administrative network that works to improve the life of student residents and provide them with guidance and academic support.  Each individual hall is assigned a '''Resident Faculty Leader''' (RFL, pronounced riffle), that oversees all programming aspects of the hall and lives in a house (usually next door to the hall) where students meet for Hall Council meetings and other planned events.  Each hall is also assigned a '''[[Residence Hall Coordinator]]''' (RHC) who works closely with the RFL to oversee hall programming and is responsible for more hands-on daily operations of the hall.  Along with these two positions is the '''[[Resident Assistant]]''' (RA), who is either an undergraduate or graduate student who has lived in the residence halls for at least one year and who take responsibility for the daily operations of one floor each.  This three part system or RFL, RHC, and RA have signifcantly improved the day to day lives of students living in the residence halls and have been nationally recognized and duplicated.

== Athletics ==
{{main|West Virginia Mountaineers}}
The school's sports teams are called the Mountaineers and compete in the [[Big East Conference]], a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I.  The school has teams in 13 college sports and has won several national championships (including multiple [[NCAA Rifle team championship]]s, track, and wrestling.)

Mountaineer sports were started in [[1891]] when a group of students organized the first football game at the school.  

Some of the most notable athletes at West Virginia University are; Stan "The Man" Boskovich, [[Jerry West]] (NBA Logo), [[Sam Huff]], [[Rod Hundley|"Hot Rod" Hundley]], [[Rod Thorn]], [[Joe Stydahar]], [[Jeff Hostetler]], [[Major Harris]], [[Jerry Porter]], [[Kevin Pittsnogle]], [[Marc Bulger]], [[Avon Cobourne]], [[Mike Vanderjagt]], [[Todd Sauerbrun]], [[Pacman Jones|Adam "Pacman" Jones]], [[Greg Jones]] (Three-time national champion in wrestling), Nate Carr (wrestling), Mike Mason (Wrestling), Georgann Wells (1st Woman to dunk in league competition), [[Amos Zereoue]], [[Quincy Wilson]], [[Chris Henry]], [[Mike Gansey]].

==School Traditions==
One of the reasons WVU has such a strong history in athletics is perhaps because of the many traditions at the university. Several of the school traditions and icons are listed below:

===Flying WV===
[[Image:Goldoutline115w.gif|right|The "Flying WV"]]
The logo of the university is known as the "Flying WV," which is one of the most popular items to emerge from the Don Nehlen era of Mountaineer football.  The logo was quickly adopted as the official university logo.

===The Mountaineer===
The Mountaineer was adopted in [[1890]] as the official school mascot.  A new Mountaineer is selected every year by the school's senior honorary, The Mountain.  The new Mountaineer is given a custom tailored outfit and carries a traditional rifle which is fired to mark the opening of sporting events.  Male Mountaineers traditionally grow a beard and wear a coonskin cap.

===Take Me Home, Country Roads===
The [[John Denver]] song ''Take Me Home, Country Roads'', which has become a ''de facto'' anthem for the state, has also been adopted by WVU as its unofficial theme song.  It is commonly played at most home sporting events as well as other occasions on campus.  John Denver himself showed up in [[1980]] to help dedicate the new Mountaineer Field, now called Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium, and led the crowd in ''Take Me Home, Country Roads.''
It is now part of a new tradition:  After a victory, fans are encouraged to stay in the stands and sing "Take Me Home, Country Roads" along with the football team.

===The Pride of West Virginia—The Mountaineer Marching Band===
[[Image:sugar_bowl06.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Pride of West Virginia at the 2006 Nokia Sugar Bowl]]
The [http://www.wvuband.org/ WVU Marching Band], nicknamed the Pride of West Virginia, was formed in 1901 as an all-male ROTC band. The band performs at every home football game and makes many other appearances on- and off-campus throughout the year.

During its traditional pre-game performance, the band enters [[Milan Puskar Stadium|Milan Puskar Stadium at Mountaineer Field]] from end-zone tunnels to a spirited, 220-beats per minute "run on" cadence. The band plays several university songs and favorites including: "Fight, Mountaineers," "Mountain Dew," "Simple Gifts" (from ''[[Appalachian Spring]]''), "West Virginia University's Alma Mater," "The Star Spangled Banner," "Country Roads," and "Hail West Virginia!" The band also forms several iconic images during its pre-game show including the [[#Flying WV|Flying WV]], WVU, expanding circles, and an outline of the state of [[West Virginia]]. Each season's pre-game show is similar but unique.

The Mountaineer Marching Band is renowned for its high energy performances, outstanding musical arrangements, and innovative drill moves.  In 1997, the WVU Band was awarded the [[Sudler Trophy]] by the [[John Philip Sousa Foundation]] in recognition of its tradition of excellence.

The WVU band is also known for being one of the few college marching band to include a male baton twirler.

===Fight song===
''"Hail, West Virginia"'' is the fight song for the university.  It was composed by WVU alumni Earl Miller and Ed McWhorther in [[1915]].  The lyrics were written by Fred B. Deem, who later became a lawyer in Clarksburg.  The Mountaineer Marching Band performs the second verse of "Hail, West Virginia" as part of its pregame performance at [[West Virginia Mountaineers|Mountaineer]] football games. The lyrics are available at the [http://alumni.wvu.edu/traditions/hail_west_virginia/ WVU Alumni page].

===Roll out the carpet!===

One of college basketball’s great traditions was introduced by Fred Schaus at West Virginia University in 1955. It was during that time that Schaus and Mountaineer supporter Alex Mumford came up with the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for the Mountaineer players to run out on during pregame warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue painted basketball. 

West Virginia University continued this tradition during the George King era until it was interrupted in the late 1960s. Former Mountaineer player Gale Catlett reintroduced the carpet when he returned to West Virginia in 1978, and it has since become the highlight of pregame introductions at the WVU Coliseum
