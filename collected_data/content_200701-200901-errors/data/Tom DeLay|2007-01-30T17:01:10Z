}}'''Thomas Dale DeLay''' (born [[April 8]] [[1947]]) is a former member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]], [[Texas]]. He was [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] from 2003-2006 and is a prominent [[American conservatism|conservative]] member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

DeLay was first elected to the House in 1984. He became known as "The Hammer" for his enforcement of party discipline in close votes and his reputation for taking political retribution on opponents. He was appointed [[Minority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|Deputy Minority Whip]] in 1988 and was elected [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] in 1995 after helping [[Newt Gingrich]] to lead the [[Republican Revolution]]. In the 1990s, he helped to start the [[K Street Project]], an effort to pressure [[lobbying]] firms to hire Republicans to top positions. He was a driving force behind the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]] of President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1998. DeLay was elected House Majority Leader after the [[U.S. House election, 2002|2002 midterm elections]], and compelled House Republicans to unite to an unprecedented degree, especially in support of President [[George W. Bush]]'s agenda.

In the early 2000s, DeLay helped to coordinate efforts to [[2003 Texas redistricting|redistrict congressional districts]] in Texas to favor the election of more Republicans. In 2005, a Texas [[grand jury]] [[indictment|indicted]] DeLay on criminal charges that he had conspired to violate [[campaign finance]] laws during that period. DeLay denied the charges, saying that they were politically motivated, but [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|Republican Conference]] rules forced him to resign temporarily from his position as Majority Leader. In January 2006, under pressure from fellow Republicans, DeLay announced that he would not seek to return to the position. In the months before and after this decision, two of his former aides were convicted in the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal|Jack Abramoff scandal]]. DeLay ran for re-election in [[United States House elections, 2006|2006]], and won the Republican [[primary election]] in March 2006, but, citing the possibility of losing the general election, he announced in April 2006 that he would withdraw from the race and resign his seat in Congress. He resigned on [[June 9]] [[2006]], and sought to remove his name from the ballot. The court battle that followed forced him to remain on the ballot, despite having withdrawn from the race.

==Biography and early political career==
DeLay was born in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], Texas. He spent part of his childhood in [[Venezuela]], due to his father's work in the [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] industry. He later attended Calallen High School in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], and spent two years as a pre-med student at [[Baylor University]] before he was expelled for drinking and [[vandalism]]&ndash;DeLay was caught painting a building at rival [[Texas A&M University]] green and gold, Baylor's colors. DeLay married Christine Furrh, whom he had known since high school, in 1967. The DeLays had a daughter, Danielle, in 1972.

DeLay received a [[Bachelor of Science]] [[academic degree|degree]] with a major in biology from the [[University of Houston]] in 1970. He spent three years working for Redwood Chemical before founding Albo Pest Control. This work was the source for his nickname "the Exterminator". In the eleven years for which DeLay ran the company, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] imposed [[tax lien]]s on him three times for not paying payroll and income taxes.<ref name="absolutetruth">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A6825-2001May9&no | title=Absolute Truth | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | date=May 13, 2001 | author=Peter Perl}}</ref> The [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s ban on a certain [[pesticide]] that was used in extermination work led DeLay to oppose government regulation of businesses, a belief that he has carried with him throughout his political career.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.texasobserver.org/showArticle.asp?ArticleID=143 | title=The DeLay Chronicles|publisher=[[The Texas Observer]] | date=February 4, 2000 | author=Julie Hollar | accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref>

In 1978, DeLay won the election for an open seat in the [[Texas House of Representatives]]. He was the first Republican to represent [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort Bend County]] in the state House. During his time in the Texas Legislature, he struggled with [[alcoholism]] and gained a reputation as a playboy, earning the nickname "Hot Tub Tom". By the time of his election to Congress, he drank "eight, ten, twelve [[martini cocktail|martinis]] a night at receptions and fundraisers."<ref name="absolutetruth" /> In 1985, DeLay became a [[born again|born-again Christian]], and later gave up hard liquor. In 1994, Christine DeLay began volunteering as a court-appointed special advocate for children in [[foster care]], and soon thereafter, the DeLays became foster parents to three teenage boys.

DeLay has declined to comment on reports in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that he is estranged from much of his family, including his mother and one of his brothers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/062199delay-profile.html | title=Tom DeLay Holds No Gavel, But a Firm Grip on the Reins | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 21, 1999 | author=Melinda Henneberger}}</ref> DeLay has not spoken to his younger brother, Randy, a [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] lobbyist, since 1996, when a complaint to the [[U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]] prompted Tom DeLay to cut his brother off in order to avoid the appearance of a [[conflict of interest]].<ref name="absolutetruth" />

DeLay was elected to the House in [[U.S. House election, 1984|1984]], representing the [[United States House of Representatives, Texas District 22|Texas 22nd congressional district]], after his predecessor, Republican [[Ron Paul]], declined to run for re-election to run in the Republican primary for the 1984 [[U.S. Senate]] race.

==Early Congressional career==
As a member of the Republican minority in the 1980s, DeLay made a name for himself by criticizing the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the Environmental Protection Agency. During his first term in Congress, DeLay was appointed to the Republican Committee on Committees, which assigned representatives to [[House committee]]s, and in his second term, he was appointed to the powerful [[House Appropriations Committee]], a position that he retained until his election as Majority Leader in 2003. He was reappointed to the committee in 2006 after leaving his position as Majority Leader. He also served for a time as chairman of a group of conservative House Republicans known as the [[Republican Study Committee]], and as secretary of the Republican Conference.

In 1988, questions were raised about Republican vice-presidential nominee [[Dan Quayle]]'s alleged use of family connections to get into the [[Indiana]] [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] to avoid possible combat service in the [[Vietnam War]]. DeLay reportedly defended Quayle by saying that he had tried to enlist himself at the same age, but was told ethnic minorities had already filled most of the available positions.<ref name="whatdidyoudo">{{cite news | url=http://www.slate.com/id/1002713/ | title=What Did You Do in the War, Hammer?|publisher=[[Slate.com]] | date=May 4, 1999 | author=Timothy Noah}}</ref>

No one close to DeLay corroborated that DeLay attempted to serve. ''The Washington Post'' reported that he had received student deferments while at Baylor and had kept the deferment after his expulsion from Baylor in 1967. He received a high [[draft lottery (1969)|draft lottery]] number in 1969, and graduated from University of Houston in 1970.<ref name="whatdidyoudo" />

DeLay was appointed deputy whip by then-[[Minority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|Minority]] [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] [[Dick Cheney]] in 1988. When the Republican Party gained control of the House in 1995 following the [[U.S. House election, 1994|1994 election]], DeLay was elected [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]] against the wishes of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]]-elect [[Newt Gingrich]].

DeLay was not always on good terms with Gingrich or [[Dick Armey]], the House Majority Leader from 1995 to 2003, and he reportedly considered them uncommitted to [[Christian values]]. In 1997 DeLay unsuccessfully tried to remove Gingrich from his position as Speaker. Nevertheless, in the heyday of the 104th Congress (1995-1997), DeLay described the Republican leadership as a [[triumvirate]] of Gingrich, "the visionary"; Armey, "the [[policy wonk]]"; and himself, "the ditch digger who makes it all happen".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.texasobserver.org/showArticle.asp?ArticleID=142 | title=DeLay, Incorporated | publisher=The Texas Observer | author=Robert Dreyfuss | date=February 4, 2000 | accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref>

In keeping with his opposition to environmental regulation, DeLay criticized proposals to phase out the use of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs), which lead to the depletion of the [[ozone layer]]. In 1995, DeLay introduced a bill to revoke the CFC ban and to repeal provisions of the [[Clean Air Act]] dealing with stratospheric ozone, arguing that the science underlying the ban was debatable.

As Majority Whip, DeLay earned the nickname "The Hammer" for his enforcement of party discipline in close votes and his reputation for wreaking political vengeance on opponents. DeLay has expressed a liking for his nickname, pointing out that the [[hammer]] is one of a [[carpenter]]'s most valuable tools.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tomdelay.com/home/2006/12/20/pelosi-stumbling-out-of-the-gate.html | author=DeLay, Tom | title=Pelosi, Stumbling out of the Gate | date=December 20, 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-09}}</ref><!-- Should this be noted as an explicitly Christian metaphor?--> In the 104th Congress, DeLay successfully whipped 300 out of 303 bills.<ref>{{cite book | last=Dubose | first=Lou | coauthors=Jan Reid | title=The Hammer: Tom DeLay: God, Money, and the Rise of the Republican Congress | date=2004-09-28 | publisher=PublicAffairs | id=ISBN 1-58648-238-6 | pages=p. 98}}</ref>

In 1998, DeLay worked to ensure that the House vote on impeaching President [[Bill Clinton]] was successful.<ref name="absolutetruth" /> DeLay rejected efforts to [[censure]] Clinton, who, DeLay said, had lied under oath.<ref name="bigpush">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1998/12/07/impeachment.html | title=The big push to impeach | publisher=[[TIME]] | author=Carney, James and John F.

===Contributions from Russian oil executives===
In December 2005, the ''Washington Post'' reported that, in 1998, a group of [[Russia]]n oil executives had given money to a non-profit advocacy group run by a former DeLay staffer and funded by clients of [[lobbyist]] [[Jack Abramoff]] in an attempt to influence DeLay's vote on an [[International Monetary Fund]] bailout of the Russian economy.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/30/AR2005123001480_pf.html | title=The DeLay-Abramoff Money Trail | publisher=The Washington Post | date=December 31, 2005 | author=R. Jeffrey Smith | page=A01}}</ref> Associates of DeLay advisor [[Ed Buckham]], the founder of the [[U.S. Family Network]], said that executives from the oil firm [[Naftasib]] had offered a donation of $1,000,000 to be delivered to a [[Washington, D.C.]]-area airport in order to secure DeLay's support. On [[June 25]] [[1998]], the U.S. Family Network received a $1 million check via money transferred through the London law firm James & Sarch Co. This payment was the largest single entry on U.S. Family Network's donor list. The original source of the donation was not recorded.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/08/wus08.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/01/08/ixnewstop.html | title=British lawyers linked to $1 million payment for favours at US Congress|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=January 8, 2006}}</ref> DeLay denied that the payment had influenced his vote. Naftasib denied that it had made the payment and that it had ever been represented by James & Sarch Co. The now-dissolved law firm's former partners declined to comment due to confidentiality requirements.

===Settlement in civil suit===
In early 1999, the ''[[The New Republic]]'' picked up a story, first reported by Houston-area alternative weeklies,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.texasobserver.org/showArticle.asp?ArticleID=964 | title=One-Day Stories | publisher=The Texas Observer | date=February 19, 1999 | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> alleging that DeLay had committed [[perjury]] during a civil lawsuit brought against him by a former business partner in 1994.<ref>{{cite news | title=Delayed Justice | pages=11-12+|publisher=[[The New Republic]] | date=February 15, 1999 | author=Bardach, Anne-Louise}}</ref>

The plaintiff in that suit, Robert Blankenship, charged that DeLay and a third partner in Albo Pest Control had breached the partnership agreement by trying to force him out of the business without buying him out. Blankenship filed suit, charging DeLay and the other partner with breach of [[fiduciary duty]], [[fraud]], [[wrongful termination]], and loss of [[corporate expectancy]]. While being [[deposition (law)|deposed]] in that suit, DeLay claimed that he did not think that he was an officer or [[board of directors|director]] of Albo and that he believed that he had resigned two or three years previously.<ref name="absolutetruth" /> However, his congressional disclosure forms, including one filed subsequent to the deposition, stated that he was either president or chairman of the company between 1985 and 1994. Blankenship also alleged that Albo money had been spent on DeLay's congressional campaigns, in violation of federal and state law.

DeLay and Blankenship [[settlement (law)|settled]] for an undisclosed sum. Blankenship's attorney said that had he known about the congressional disclosure forms, he would have referred the case to the [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] district attorney's office for a perjury prosecution. These allegations have never been investigated and DeLay has never been charged with a crime in connection with this case.

==Majority Leader==

After serving as his party's Whip for eight years, DeLay was elected Majority Leader upon the retirement of Dick Armey in 2003. His tenure as Majority Leader was marked by strong Republican party discipline and by parliamentary and redistricting efforts to preserve Republican control of the House.

After being indicted on [[September 28]] [[2005]], DeLay stepped down from his position as Majority Leader. He was the first congressional leader ever to be indicted.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-delay-investigation,1,1414739.story?coll=chi-news-hed | title=DeLay Steps Down From House Post | publisher=The Associated Press | author=Margasak, Larry | date=September 29, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-23}}</ref> Rep. [[Roy Blunt]] of Missouri took over as acting leader.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9507677/ | title=DeLay indicted in campaign finance probe | publisher=[[The Associated Press]] | date=September 28, 2005|accessdate=2006-04-14}}</ref> On [[January 7]] [[2006]], after weeks of growing pressure from Republican colleagues, and particularly from Reps. [[Charlie Bass]] and [[Jeff Flake]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/06/AR2006010601763.html | title=Tide Turning Against DeLay | publisher=The Washington Post | author=Weisman, Jonathan | date=January 7, 2006 | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> who wanted to avoid being associated with DeLay's legal issues in an election year, DeLay announced that he would not seek to regain his position as Majority Leader.

===Legislative and electoral methods===
DeLay was known to "primary" Republicans who resisted his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican [[primary election|primary]] challenge to the disobedient representative),<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060801342.html | title=DeLay Pulls No Punches In Final Speech to House | publisher=The Washington Post | author=Grunwald, Michael | date=June 9, 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-09}}</ref> and, like many of his predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the rank-and-file members of the party.{{fact}}

Employing a method known as "[[catch and release (congress)|catch and release]]," DeLay allowed [[centrist]] or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal.{{fact}}

In the 108th Congress, a preliminary [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] vote passed 216-215, a vote on [[Head Start]] passed 217-216, a vote on [[school voucher]]s for Washington, D.C. passed 209-208, and "[[Fast track]]," usually called "trade promotion authority", passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as "growing the vote".

DeLay was also noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills. One lobbyist said, "I've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill - at least like they are asking us to whip bills now."<ref>Dubose and Reid, p. 93</ref>

DeLay's ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.asp?strid=C00292946&cycle=2004 | title=Political Action Committees: Americans for a Republican Majority | publisher=Center for Responsive Politics | accessdate=September 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Partly as a result of DeLay's management abilities, the House Republican caucus under him displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-04-04-delay-usat-analysis_x.htm | title=DeLay's hardball tactics coming back on him|publisher=[[USA Today]] | author=Drinkard, Jim | date=April 5, 2006 | accessdate=2006-04-29}}</ref>

On [[September 30]] [[2004]], the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay because he "offered to endorse Representative [[Nick Smith (U.S. politician)|[Nick] Smith]]'s son in exchange for Representative Smith's vote in favor of the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare bill]]."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.house.gov/ethics/Medicare_Report.pdf|format=[[PDF]] | title=Investigation of Certain Allegations Related to Voting on the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 | publisher=U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct | date=September 30, 2004 | accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref>

===Domestic policy===
In 2001, DeLay defied President George W. Bush when DeLay refused to increase the [[Earned Income Credit]] (EIC) welfare entitlement during the congressional battle over Bush's [[tax cut]]s for people making between $10,500 and $26,625 a year; when reporters asked DeLay about what he would do about increasing the EIC, DeLay simply stated, "[It] ain't going to happen." When Bush's press secretary [[Ari Fleischer]] reiterated the president's desire for a low-income tax cut, DeLay retorted, "The last time I checked they [the [[executive branch]]] don't have a vote."<ref>{{cite news | title=G.O.P. Leader Brushes Off Pressure by Bush on Taxes | publisher=The New York Times | page=1 | date=June 11, 2003}}</ref>

DeLay was rated a 2.77 out of 100 by Progressive Punch for his votes regarding corporate subsidies, government checks on corporate power, human rights and civil liberties, labor rights and environmental policy.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.progressivepunch.com/ | title=Progressive Punch | publisher=www.progressivepunch.com | accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> 

On [[economic policy]], DeLay was rated 95 out of 100 by [[Americans for Tax Reform]], and 95 to 100 by the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], a pro-business lobby. On environmental policy, he earned ratings of 0 from the [[Sierra Club]] and [[League of Conservation Voters]]. He has been a fervent critic of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], which he has called the "[[Gestapo]] of government".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/EARTH/9512/congress_enviro/ | title=Year in Review: Congress vs. Environment|publisher=[[CNN]] | date=December 29, 1995 | accessdate=2006-04-15 | author=Bruce Burkhard}}</ref>
DeLay is for gun rights in the [[gun politics]] debate.<ref name="absolutetruth" /> The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] measured that his voting history aligned with their civil liberties platform 0% of the time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://action.aclu.org/site/VoteCenter?page=congScorecard | title=National Freedom Scorecard|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

DeLay blamed Senate Democrats and what he called "[[BANANA]] (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything) [[environmentalism|environmentalists]]" for blocking legislative solutions to problems such as the [[2003 North America blackout]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030818-122326-3716r.htm | title=Feds investigate cause of blackout|publisher=[[The Washington Times]] | date=August 18, 2003 | accessdate=2006-04-15 | author=Hudson, Audrey}}</ref>

DeLay maintained public silence on Houston's 2003 [[METRORail]] [[light rail]] initiative, though in the past, he had opposed expanding light rail to Houston. Public filings later showed that DeLay had his [[Americans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee]] (ARMPAC) and his congressional campaign committee send money to [[Texans for True Mobility]], an organization that advocated against the initiative. The proposal passed by a slim margin.<ref>{{cite news | title=DeLay PACs funded efforts to defeat rail; $30,000 given to opposition group | page=1|publisher=[[The Houston Chronicle]] | date=March 24, 2004}}</ref> Despite his earlier opposition, following the passage of the initiative, DeLay helped to obtain funding for the light rail program.<ref>{{cite news | title=New transit plan is leaning more toward buses | publisher=The Houston Chronicle | date=June 13, 2005 | page=1 | author=Sallee, Rad}}</ref>

DeLay is [[pro-life]].<ref name="absolutetruth" /> In 2005, he voted 100% in line with the views of the National Right-to-Life Committee and 0% with the [[National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/choice-action-center/in-congress/congressional-record-on-choice/state.html?state=TX | title=Congressional Record on Choice by State|publisher=[[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-06-25}}</ref>

DeLay supported the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005]]. Critics of this law argued that it unduly favors creditors over consumers, and noted that the [[credit card]] industry spent millions of dollars lobbying in support of the act.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53688-2005Apr14.html | title=Bankruptcy Bill Passes; Bush Expected to Sign | publisher=The Washington Post | author=Day, Kathleen | date=April 15, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-24}}</ref>

In 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay for his actions related to a 2002 energy bill. A Committee memo stated that DeLay "created the appearance that donors were being provided with special access to Representative DeLay regarding the then-pending energy legislation."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.house.gov/ethics/DeLay_memo.htm | title=DeLay Memo | publisher=U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct | accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref>

In 2005, DeLay, acting against the president's wishes, initiated the "safe harbor" provision for [[MTBE]] in the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], together with Rep. [[Joe Barton]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7574562/|publisher=[[MSNBC]] | title=House approves $12 billion energy package | date=April 21, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> This provision would have retroactively protected the makers of the gasoline additive from lawsuits. The provision was dropped from the final bill.

DeLay opposes the teaching of the theory of evolution.  After the [[Columbine High School massacre]], he entered into the congressional record a statement saying that shootings happened in part "because our school systems teach our children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized [''sic''] out of some primordial soup of mud."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html | title=Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in Prosperous Democracies | publisher=''The Journal of Religion & Society'' | author=Paul, Gregory S., Ph.D .| date=2005 | accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
DeLay has been a strong supporter of the State of [[Israel]], saying, "The Republican leadership, especially that leadership in the House, has made pro-Israel policy a fundamental component of our [[foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy]] agenda and it drives the Democrat leadership crazy&ndash;because they just can’t figure out why we do it!"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5822374/ | title=DeLay makes intense appeal for Jewish voters | publisher=MSNBC | date=September 1, 2004 | accessdate=2006-04-15 | last=Curry | first=Tom}}</ref> In a 2002 speech, DeLay promised to "use every tool at my disposal to ensure that the Republican Conference, and the House of Representatives, continues to preserve and strengthen America's alliance with the State of Israel."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.acpr.org.il/Israel's_friends/Tom_DeLay-nov2002.html | title=A Night to Honor Israel | publisher=Ariel Center for Policy Research | accessdate=April 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On a 2003 trip to Israel, DeLay toured the nation and addressed members of the [[Knesset]]. His opposition to land concessions is so strong that [[Aryeh Eldad]], the deputy of Israel's conservative [[National Union Party]], remarked, "As I shook his hand, I told Tom DeLay that until I heard him speak, I thought I was farthest to the right in the Knesset."<ref>{{cite news | title=House's DeLay Bonds With Israeli Hawks | publisher=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | page=A.5 | date=July 31, 2003 | last=Stack|first=Megan K.}}</ref> Former [[Mossad]] chief [[Danny Yatom]] said "The [[Likud]] is nothing compared to this guy."<ref>Dubose and Reid, p. 236</ref>

In 2005, in a snub to the Bush administration, DeLay was the "driving force behind the rejection of direct aid" to the [[Palestinian Authority]]. The deal was "brokered" by the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]]. In the wake of the legislation, some Jewish leaders expressed concern "about the degree to which the Texas Republican, an evangelical Christian who opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, will go to undercut American and Israeli attempts to achieve a [[two-state solution]]."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.forward.com/articles/2826 | title=House Sets Limits on Palestinian Aid As DeLay Defies Calls of Bush, Rice|publisher=[[The Forward]] | last=Nir | first=Ori | date=March 18, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

DeLay has long been a strong critic of [[Cuba]]n leader [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime, which DeLay has called a "thugocracy", and a supporter of the U.S. [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo against Cuba]].

During the Texas [[redistricting warrant]] controversy, several Democratic members of the [[Texas legislature|Texas House of Representatives]] fled to [[Oklahoma]] to prevent the House from establishing a [[quorum]] of members, thereby preventing the House from acting on any legislation. Although not a member of the Texas legislature, DeLay became involved, by contacting several federal agencies in order to determine the location of the missing legislators. DeLay's staff contacted the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) for assistance in tracking down a plane that one of the legislators was flying to Oklahoma, an action that the FAA believed to be a result of safety concerns about the aircraft.<ref name="drawingtheline">{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060306fa_fact | title=Drawing the Line | author=Toobin, Jeffrey | publisher=[[The New Yorker]] | date=February 27, 2006 | accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref> A review by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] found that a total of thirteen FAA employees spent more than eight hours searching for the airplane.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/18/politics/main649927.shtml | title=Texas Redistricting Fight Not Over | publisher=The Associated Press | date=October 18, 2004 | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref> Members of DeLay's staff asked the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to arrest the missing Democrats.

U.S. Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]] requested an investigation into the Congressman's involvement in the requests, and asked that any [[White House]] involvement be reported.

===The K Street Project===
{{see also|K Street Project}}
DeLay's involvement with the lobbying industry included a pointed effort on the part of the Republican Party to parlay the Congressional majority into dominance of [[K Street]], the lobbying district of Washington, D.C. DeLay, Senator [[Rick Santorum]], and [[Grover Norquist]] launched a campaign in 1995 encouraging lobbying firms to retain Republican officials in top positions. Firms that had Democrats in positions of authority, DeLay suggested, would not be granted the ear of majority party members. 

In 1999, DeLay was privately reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee after he pulled an important intellectual property rights bill off of the House floor when the Electronics Industries Alliance hired a former Democratic Congressman, [[Dave McCurdy]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/04/08/scandals/index1.html | title=Broken Hammer?|publisher=[[Salon.com]] | last=Dubose | first=Lou | date=April 8, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

Firms initially responded to the campaign, but it waned during 2004, when the possibility of Senator [[John Kerry]]'s winning the presidency gave lobbying firms some incentive to hire Democrats.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21972-2004Jul1.html | publisher=The Washington Post | title=Going Left on K Street | last=Birnbaum | first=Jeffrey H. | date=July 2, 2004 | accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref>

DeLay has long been a strong critic of [[Cuba]]n leader [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime, which DeLay has called a "thugocracy", and a supporter of the U.S. [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo against Cuba]]. However, in April 2005, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' published a photo from a July 2003 trip to Israel, in which DeLay is seen [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] a Cuban [[cigar]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1054968,00.html | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | title=But Did He Inhale? | date=27 April 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-16 | author=Tumulty, Karen}}</ref> The consumption or purchase of Cuban cigars is illegal in the United States (but was, at the time, not illegal abroad). Since September 2004, the [[U.S. Treasury Department]]'s enforcement of the law has been toughened to forbid consumption (smoking) or purchase of Cuban cigars by U.S. citizens anywhere in the world.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.treasury.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/legacy/ccigar2.pdf | title=Cuban Cigar Update | format=[[PDF]]|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] | accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref> As Cuban cigars have been a (if not ''the'') central symbol of the U.S. embargo on Cuban trade, DeLay's action - apparently contradicting his well-known and strongly-stated personal convictions regarding Cuba - was widely reported.

===Terri Schiavo===
{{see also|Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case}}
DeLay made headlines for his role in the [[Terri Schiavo]] controversy. On [[Palm Sunday]] weekend in March 2005, several days after the brain-damaged Florida woman's feeding tube was disconnected for the third time, the House met in emergency session to pass a bill allowing Schiavo's parents to petition a federal judge to review the removal of the feeding tube. DeLay called the removal of the feeding tube "an act of barbarism." DeLay faced accusations of hypocrisy from critics when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' revealed that he had consented to ending [[life support]] for his father, who had been in a [[coma]]tose state because of a debilitating accident in 1988.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/03/27/MNGTRBVFV01.DTL | title=In '88, accident forced DeLays to choose between life, death | publisher=The Los Angeles Times | date=March 27, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

DeLay was accused of endorsing violence in the wake of a series of high-profile violent crimes and death threats against judges when he said, "The men responsible [for Terri Schiavo's death] will have to answer to their behavior." DeLay's comments came soon after the [[February 28]] [[2005]] homicide of the mother and husband of Chicago Judge [[Joan Lefkow]], and the [[March 11]] [[2005]] killing of Atlanta Judge [[Rowland Barnes]]. DeLay's opponents accused him of rationalizing violence against judges when their decisions were unpopular with the public. [[Ralph Neas]], President of [[People for the American Way]], said that DeLay's comments were "irresponsible and could be seen by some as justifying inexcusable conduct against our courts."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26236-2005Apr4.html | publisher=The Washington Post | title=Senator Links Violence to 'Political' Decisions | author=Babington, Charles | date=April 5, 2005|accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> DeLay publicly apologized for the remark after being accused of threatening the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].

===Jack Abramoff===
{{Jack Abramoff}}
{{see also|Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal}}

DeLay may be one of the targets of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] investigation into Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff's actions. Abramoff allegedly provided DeLay with trips, gifts, and political donations in exchange for favors to Abramoff's lobbying clients, which included the government of the U.S. Commonwealth of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[internet gambling]] services, and several Native American tribes.<ref name="underscrutiny">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/25/AR2005112501423_pf.html | title=Lawmakers Under Scrutiny in Probe of Lobbyist | publisher=The Washington Post | author=Schmidt, Susan, and James V. Grimaldi | date=November 26, 2005|accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref> Two of DeLay's former political aides, [[Tony Rudy]] and [[Michael Scanlon]], as well as Abramoff himself, pled guilty in 2006 to charges relating to the investigation. Political columnist [[Robert Novak]] has since reported that Abramoff "has no derogatory information about former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and is not implicating him as part of his plea bargain with federal prosecutors."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://townhall.com/opinion/columns/robertnovak/2006/03/25/191300.html | title=Abramoff clearing DeLay | date=March 25, 2006 | accessdate=2006-04-16 | author=[[Bob Novak|Novak, Robert]]}}</ref>

According to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[20/20]]'' television program, Abramoff lobbied DeLay to stop legislation banning [[sex shop]]s and [[sweatshop]]s that forced employees to have abortions in the Northern Mariana Islands when Abramoff accompanied DeLay on a 1997 trip to the U.S. commonwealth. While on the trip, DeLay promised not to put the bill on the legislative calendar.<ref name="islandgetaway">{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=647725&page=1 | title=DeLay's Lavish Island Getaway | publisher=[[ABC News]]|author=[[Brian Ross (journalist)|Ross, Brian]] | date=April 6, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref>

In 2000, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a worker reform bill to extend the protection of U.S. labor and [[minimum wage|minimum-wage]] laws to the workers in the Northern Mariana Islands. DeLay, then the House Republican Whip, stopped the House from considering the bill.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/09/real.delay/ | title=The real scandal of Tom DeLay | publisher=CNN | author=[[Mark Shields|Shields, Mark]] | date=May 9, 2005|accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref> DeLay later blocked a fact-finding mission planned by Rep. [[Peter Hoekstra]] by threatening Hoekstra with the loss of his subcommittee chairmanship.<ref name="islandgetaway" />

DeLay received gifts from Abramoff, including paid golfing holidays to [[Scotland]], concert tickets, and the use of Abramoff's private [[skybox]]es for fundraisers. In May 2000, ARMPAC received the free use of one of Abramoff's private skyboxes to host a political fundraiser. At the time, campaign finance laws did not require the use of the skybox, valued at several thousand dollars, to be disclosed or for Abramoff to be reimbursed for its use.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7577057/ | title=DeLay used lobbyist's concert skybox | publisher=The Associated Press | date=April 20, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref>

Later that month, the DeLays, Rudy, another aide, and Abramoff took a trip to [[London]] and Scotland. Abramoff paid for the airfare for the trip, and lobbyist Ed Buckham paid for expenses at a hotel at [[St. Andrews]] golf course in Scotland.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12416-2005Apr23.html | title=DeLay Airfare Was Charged to Lobbyist's Credit Card | publisher=The Washington Post | author=Smith, R. Jeffrey | date=April 24, 2005 | accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> Abramoff was reimbursed by The National Center for Public Policy Research, the nonprofit organization that arranged the trip. On the day that the trip began, The National Center received large donations from two of Abramoff's clients, internet lottery service eLottery, Inc., and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Both organizations denied that they had intended to pay for DeLay's trip.<ref name="gamblinginterests">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28252-2005Mar11.html | title=Gambling Interests Funded DeLay Trip | publisher=The Washington Post | author=Grimaldi, James V., and R.

DeLay denied knowing that lobbyists had paid for travel expenses. In July 2000, DeLay voted against a bill that would have restricted internet gambling. Both eLottery and the Choctaws opposed the bill.<ref name="gamblinginterests" /> Rudy, who was then DeLay's deputy chief of staff, doomed the bill by engineering a parliamentary maneuver that required a two-thirds majority vote, rather than a simple majority, in order for the bill to pass. Rudy's actions on behalf of Abramoff's clients during this time were mentioned in Abramoff's guilty plea in January 2006.<ref name="Rudyinvestigation">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/09/AR2006010900952.html | title=Abramoff Probe Turns Focus on DeLay Aide | publisher=The Washington Post | author=Weisman, Jonathan | date=January 8, 2006 | accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref>

In January 2006, ''The Associated Press'' reported that in 2001, DeLay co-signed a letter to [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] calling for the closure of a casino owned by the [[Alabama-Coushatta Tribe]] of Texas. Two weeks earlier, the Choctaws had donated $1,000 to DeLay's [[Texans for a Republican Majority]] PAC (TRMPAC). A DeLay spokesman denied that the donations had influenced DeLay's actions.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/10/politics/main1196412.shtml | title=Report: DeLay Pushed To Shut Casino | publisher=The Associated Press | date=January 10, 2006 | accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref> Currently, and at the time of the letter, casinos or other private gambling establishments are illegal in Texas, even on Indian reservations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.010.00.000047.00.htm | title=Texas Penal Code, Chapter 47: Gambling | accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref>

Scanlon, who became Abramoff's lobbying partner, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to conspiracy charges.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/21/scanlon.plea/ | title= DeLay ex-aide pleads guilty in Abramoff case | publisher=CNN | author=Frieden, Terry | date=November 21, 2005 | accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> Abramoff pleaded guilty to fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy charges on [[January 3]] [[2006]], and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation. His cooperation may have forced DeLay to abandon his efforts to return to his position as House Majority Leader,<ref name="Rudyinvestigation" /> a decision that DeLay announced only a few days after Abramoff's plea bargain. Rudy pleaded guilty on [[March 31]] [[2006]] to illegally acting on Abramoff's behalf in exchange for gifts.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/31/AR2006033101742.html | title=A Force Behind the Power | publisher=The Washington Post | author=Eilperin, Juliet, and Jeffrey H. Birnbaum | date=April 1, 2006 | accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref>

Abramoff referred clients to Ed Buckham's [[Alexander Strategy Group]] (ASG), a lobbying firm. In addition, Abramoff clients gave more than $1.5 million to Buckham's U.S. Family Network. U.S. Family Network then paid ASG more than $1 million.<ref>{{cite news | title=Former DeLay Aide Enriched By Nonprofit | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/25/AR2006032501166_pf.html | last=Smith | first=R. Jeffrey | publisher=The Washington Post | date=March 26, 2006}}</ref>

From 1998 to 2002, ASG paid Christine DeLay a monthly salary averaging between $3,200 and $3,400. DeLay's attorney, Richard Cullen, initially said the payments were for telephone calls she made periodically to the offices of certain members of Congress seeking the names of their favorite charities, and that she then forwarded that information to Buckham, along with some information about those charities. But in early June 2006, Cullen said the payments were also for general political consulting she provided to her husband. In all, Christine DeLay was paid about $115,000 directly by ASG, and got another $25,000 via money put into a retirement account by the firm.<ref>{{cite news | title=Retirement Account of DeLay's Wife Traced: With Disclosure, Family's Known Benefits From Ties With Lobbyist Exceed $490,000 | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/06/AR2006060601320.html | last=Smith | first=R.

==Investigation of misconduct in Texas fundraising and indictments==
{{main|Tom DeLay corruption investigation}}
In the [[reapportionment]] following the [[U.S. Census, 1990|1990 census]], Texas Democrats drew what Republican political analyst Michael Barone argued was the most effective partisan [[gerrymander]] in the country.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-preston052703.asp | title=Red River Run | publisher=National Review | author=Bryan Preston | date=May 27, 2003 | accessdate=2006-04-19}}</ref> The Democrats won 70% of the Texas congressional seats in 1992, the first year in which the new districts were in effect, while taking slightly under 50% of the total number of votes cast for Congress statewide.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://clerk.house.gov/members/electionInfo/1992/92Stat.htm#43 | title=92 Presidential and Congressional Election Statistics | author=Donnald K. Anderson | publisher=Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives | date=May 31, 1993|accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref> After the [[U.S. Census, 2000|2000 census]], which increased Texas's representation in the House from 30 to 32, Republicans sought to redraw the district lines to support a [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] majority in the congressional delegation, while Democrats desired to retain a plan similar to the existing lines. The two parties reached an impasse in the Texas Legislature, where Republicans controlled the Senate and Democrats controlled the House. As a result, the new district lines were drawn by a three-judge federal court panel that made as few changes as possible while adding the two new seats.<ref name="drawingtheline" />

In 2001 the Texas Legislative Redistricting Board (a panel composed of the state's Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller, Speaker of the House, Attorney-General, and Land Commissioner) redrew state legislative districts in accordance with the census. The new map that was adopted by the Republican-dominated board gave the GOP an edge in winning the Texas House of Representatives, which was still controlled by the Democrats, in 2002. During the [[U.S. House election, 2002|2002 elections]] under these new maps, DeLay aggressively raised funds for Republican candidates under TRMPAC. It has since been alleged that TRMPAC was used to funnel illegal corporate donations into the campaigns of Republican candidates for State Representative.<ref name="TRMPACindicted">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/08/AR2005090800973.html | title=DeLay PAC Is Indicted For Illegal Donations | publisher=The Washington Post | author=R.

Republican victories in 2002 resulted in their control of the Texas House in addition to the Senate. As a result, the Texas Legislature was called into session in 2003 to [[2003 Texas redistricting|redistrict the state's congressional lines]] in favor of the Republican Party. A number of Democratic legislators left the state, going to Oklahoma, and later [[New Mexico]], to deny a quorum for voting. They eventually returned, and the legislation passed. The new redistricting caused five Texas congressional seats to change hands from Democrats to Republicans during the 2004 elections.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/08/ap/politics/mainD8F0924G8.shtml | title=Tenacious Tom DeLay Has Had Wild Ride | publisher=The Associated Press | date=January 7, 2006 | accessdate=2006-04-18}}</ref>

===Grand jury indictments===
{{wikinews|U.S. house majority leader DeLay indicted, steps down temporarily|date=September 28, 2005}}

On [[September 8]] [[2005]], a federal grand jury indicted TRMPAC, which allegedly accepted an illegal political contribution of $100,000 from the Alliance for Quality Nursing Home Care and the Texas Association of Business, on four charges, including unlawful political advertising, unlawful contributions to a political committee and unlawful expenditures such as those to a graphics company and political candidates.<ref name="TRMPACindicted"/>

On [[September 28]] [[2005]], a Travis County grand jury operating under Travis County District Attorney [[Ronnie Earle]] indicted DeLay for conspiring to violate Texas state election law stemming from issues dealing with his involvement in TRMPAC. Texas law prohibits corporate contributions in state legislative races. The indictment charged that TRMPAC accepted corporate contributions, laundered the money through the [[Republican National Committee]], and directed it to favored Republican candidates in Texas.

On [[September 30]] [[2005]], in response to a motion to dismiss his initial indictment, Earle sought a second indictment of DeLay from a second grand jury. That jury refused to indict. On [[October 3]] [[2005]], Earle sought and received a new indictment of DeLay from a third grand jury in Austin on charges of conspiracy and money laundering. The next day, in a written statement, Earle publicly admitted that he had presented the case to three grand juries, and that one of the three had refused to indict DeLay. Earle said that he had presented the new money-laundering charge to another grand jury because the previous grand jury had expired. DeLay's lawyers said that Earle should not have waited to make the statement until after 5 P.M. that day.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/metrostate/content/metro/stories/10/5earle.html | title=Prosecutor reveals third grand jury had refused DeLay indictment | publisher=Austin American-Statesman | last=Copelin | first=Laylan | date=October 4, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-18}}</ref> DeLay's attorneys later filed a motion in court to have the latest indictment thrown out, charging that Earle had coerced the grand jury and that he had illegally discussed grand jury information and had encouraged others to do the same.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9623710/ | title=DeLay lawyers want charges thrown out | publisher=The Associated Press | date=October 7, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref>

Also on [[October 3]], DeLay's lawyers filed a motion to throw out the charge of conspiracy to violate election law as fraudulent, claiming it was a violation of the U.S. Constitution's ban on [[ex-post facto]] applications of law. DeLay's lawyers claim that, in 2002, the crime of conspiracy did not apply to Texas election law. However, George Dix, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that charges of criminal conspiracy could legally be applied to any felony (including violation of election law) committed prior to the 2003 law. He characterized the 2003 change cited by DeLay's lawyers as a clarification of existing law, saying, "It isn't unheard of&ndash;the Legislature passing a law to make clear what the law is."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/metrostate/content/metro/stories/10/4delay.html | title=DeLay indicted on 2 new counts | publisher=Austin American-Statesman | author=Laylan Copelin | date=4 October 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-18}}</ref>

Because the Texas Penal Code defines laundered money only as money gained as the "proceeds of criminal activity",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.007.00.000034.00.htm#34.02.00 | title=Texas Penal Code, Chapter 34, Section 2: Money Laundering | accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref> DeLay's lawyers maintain that misuse of corporate donations, even if it occurred, could not constitute money laundering.

Ellis|Jim Ellis]] and TRMPAC's former executive director [[John Colyandro]], who already faced charges of [[money laundering]] in the case, as well as 13 counts of unlawful acceptance of a corporate political contribution.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/metrostate/content/metro/stories/09/14trmpac.html | title=Texas Republican PAC officials indicted | publisher=Austin American-Statesman | author=Laylan Copelin | date=September 13, 2005|accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref> The charges were brought before the grand jury by Earle. Joe Turner, who represents Colyandro, has said that he does not want a [[jury trial]] in Austin, because he believes that "DeLay and Republicans are hated [there]".<ref name="mediaoffensive">{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/metrostate/content/metro/stories/09/30delay.html | title=U.S. Rep. DeLay goes on a media offensive | publisher=Austin American-Statesman | date=September 30, 2005 | accessdate=2006-04-18}}</ref>

The indictment charged that DeLay, Colyandro and Ellis conspired to pass corporate contributions to candidates for the Texas legislature in violation of Texas [[campaign finance]] law. Allegedly, several corporations made contributions to TRMPAC. The indictment charged that TRMPAC then sent a check for $190,000 to the [[Republican National Committee]], made payable to "RNSEC" (the [[Republican National State Elections Committee]]), along with a list of state-level Republican candidates who should receive the money. According to the indictment, the Republican candidates in Texas received the money so designated.<ref>{{cite news | title=Delay [''sic''] Is Indicted in Texas Case and Forfeits G.O.P. House Post | publisher=The New York Times | date=September 28, 2005 | page=1}}</ref>

===Reaction to indictments===
{{wikinews|DeLay's lawyer claims that indictment was based on non-existent law|date=October 6, 2005}}
DeLay denounced the charges as a "sham" and an act of "political retribution," perpetuated by his opponents. He added, "I have done nothing wrong, I have violated no law, no regulation, no rule of the House."<ref name="delayindictedcnn">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/28/delay.indict/ | title=DeLay indicted, steps down as majority leader | publisher=CNN | date=September 29, 2005 | accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>

Earle, a Democrat, has indicted both Democratic and Republican office-holders in Texas, including an unsuccessful 1993 investigation of Republican Sen. [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] on charges of official misconduct and records tampering. DeLay said that Earle has a history of indicting his political enemies.<ref name="mediaoffensive" />

===Resignation of Majority Leadership===
The rules of the GOP conference call for members to give up leadership posts if they are indicted. That requirement was dropped in a push led by DeLay's allies last year, only to be restored after a storm of criticism.  As such, the indictment forced DeLay to immediately relinquish his post of House Majority Leader.  White House spokesman [[Scott McClellan]] said that President Bush still viewed DeLay as "a good ally, a leader who we have worked closely with to get things done for the American people."<ref name="delayindictedcnn" />

==2006 campaign==
{{main|Texas 22nd congressional district election, 2006}}
[[Image:Delayclose.jpg|left|thumb|190px]]
DeLay won the Republican primary on [[March 7]] [[2006]], taking 62% of the vote in the four-way race. DeLay outspent his closest opponent, Tom Campbell, by a near 20-1 ratio.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/conason/2006/03/10/delay/ | title=Broken Hammer | publisher=Salon.com | last=Conason | first=Joe | date=March 10, 2006 | accessdate=2006-04-20}}</ref>
This was his lowest showing in a primary election, and it prompted questions about whether he could win the general election.

=== Resignation and decision not to run for re-election===
On [[April 3]] [[2006]], DeLay announced that he would not run for re-election. He explained that polls showed him beating Democratic opponent [[Nick Lampson]] in the general election, but that the possibility of losing the election was too risky.<ref name="delaytostepdown">{{cite news | url=http://news.galvestondailynews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=c1d788cf5a967e2f | title=Tom DeLay to step down | publisher=[[The Galveston County Daily News]] | date=April 4, 2006 | last=Aulds | first=T.J.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/03/delay.election/index.html | title=Sources: DeLay to leave House re-election race | publisher=CNN | date=April 3, 2006 | accessdate=2006-04-19 | last=Bash|first=Dana}}</ref> Also, in the months prior to DeLay's announcement, former aides Scanlon and Rudy pleaded guilty to various charges of corruption relating to the Jack Abramoff scandal. The announcement itself came only three days after Rudy's guilty plea. DeLay announced his resignation effective [[June 9]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/DeLay_notifies_Speaker_of_House_he_0511.html | title=DeLay Notifies Speaker of House He Will Resign | publisher=Raw Story | date=May 11, 2006}}</ref> DeLay said that he planned to move to a condominium that he owns in Virginia near Washington, D.C. He stated that he could serve "the conservative cause" best by forming a lobbying firm that would work to support conservative issues.<ref name="delaytostepdown" /> 

On [[May 24]] [[2006]], DeLay's final bill, the Safe and Timely Interstate Placement of Foster Children Act of 2006, passed in the House with unanimous support. In his farewell speech on [[June 9]] to the House, he praised political partisanship for its contributions to democracy, and made a final appeal for better treatment of foster children.<ref>{{cite news | publisher=The Chicago Tribune | first=Jill | last=Zuckman | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/14773433.htm | title=Tom DeLay says his goodbyes | date=June 8, 2006}}</ref>

===Determination of eligibility and withdrawal of name===
Following DeLay's resignation and the Texas Republican Party chairwoman's declaration that DeLay was ineligible for re-election, Texas Democrats filed a lawsuit arguing that the Republican Party could not legally name another candidate for the 2006 election.<ref>{{cite news | publisher=The Houston Chronicle | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4004711.html | title=Judge says DeLay 'withdrew': Statement may spell trouble for GOP, but 22nd District issue still awaits ruling | date=June 27, 2006 | first=Janet | last=Elliot}}</ref> In July 2006, a district judge ruled that DeLay was still eligible, in part finding that allowing the Texas GOP to find DeLay ineligible based on his current residency would effectively impose an unconstitutional residency requirement.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4028453.html | title=Judge's ruling keeps DeLay on ballot | last=Radcliff | first=R.G. |date=July 6, 2006| publisher=The Houston Chronicle}}</ref> On [[August 3]], [[2006]] a 3-member panel of the [[Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] unanimously upheld the decision and affirmed the District Court's constitutional argument.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C06/06-50812-CV0.wpd.pdf | title=Texas Democratic vs. Benkiser | publisher=United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit | author= | date=August 3, 2006|accessdate=2006-08-04}}</ref>. Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] denied the stay on the same day, ruling that DeLay's name must stay on the ballot pending an appeal. This effectively ended the GOP's attempt to substitute another Republican for DeLay on the November ballot, as the Supreme Court could not hear and decide the case before the November election. 

On [[August 8]], [[2006]], DeLay announced his withdrawal from the race in order for the GOP to organize a campaign for a write-in candidate.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6001553,00.html | title=DeLay Vows to Take Name Off Texas Ballot | publisher=Guardian Unlimited|date=August 8, 2006 |author=Espo, David}}</ref> As a result, no Republican was listed on the ballot for the two-year term that begins in January 2007.<ref>[http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/candidates/2006gen.pdf Texas Secretary of State list of candidates for the November 7, 2006 general election], accessed September 16, 2006</ref>  The only two candidates on the ballot for the race were Democrat [[Nick Lampson]] and Libertarian [[Bob Smither]]. The Republicans attempted to conduct a write-in campaign for [[Shelley Sekula-Gibbs]]; however, in the general election Lampson defeated Sekula-Gibbs 51% to 43%. On the same day, Sekula-Gibbs won a special election to fill the vacant seat for the remainder of the [[109th Congress]].

==Post-Congressional career==

On [[December 10]], [[2006]], DeLay launched a [[weblog]] that is, [[as of 2006]], [[Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] based on DeLay's ideas.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nb/fortbend/news/4395103.html | title=DeLay hoping to GAIN trust of conservatives | publisher=The Houston Chronicle | author=Mittelstadt, Michelle | date=[[December 12]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Olbermann_mocks_DeLay_for_ghost_blogging_1212.html | title=Olbermann mocks DeLay for 'ghost blogging' | publisher=The Raw Story | author=Edwards, David and Ron Brynaert | date=[[December 12]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref>
