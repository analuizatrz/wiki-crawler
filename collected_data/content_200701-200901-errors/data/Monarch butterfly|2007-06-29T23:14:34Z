The '''Monarch butterfly''' (''Danaus plexippus'') is a well-known [[North America]]n [[butterfly]]. Since the 19th century, it is also found in [[New Zealand]], and in [[Australia]] where it is also known as the '''Wanderer Butterfly'''. In Europe it is resident in the [[Canary Islands]] (except [[Lanzarote]]) and [[Madeira]], and is found as a migrant in the [[Azores]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]. Its wings feature an easily recognizable orange and black pattern, with a wingspan of 8.5&ndash;12.5 cm (3.34 in&ndash;4.92in). The females have darker veins on their wings, and the males have a spot in the center of each hindwing from which [[pheromone]]s are released.

==Migration==

Monarchs are especially noted for their lengthy annual migration. They make massive southward migrations from August through until the first frost. A northward migration takes place in the spring. Female Monarchs deposit eggs for the next generation during these migrations. The population east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] in the area of [[Angangueo]], [[Michoacán]], El Rosario, [[Mexico]], and the western population overwinters in various sites in central coastal [[California]], [[United States]], notably in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]] and [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]. The length of these journeys exceeds the normal lifespan of most Monarchs, which is less than two months for butterflies born in early summer. The last generation of the summer enters into a non-reproductive phase known as diapause and may live up to 7 months. During diapause, butterflies fly to one of many overwintering sites. The generation that overwinters generally does not reproduce until it leaves the overwintering site sometime in February and March. It is thought that the overwinter population may reach as far north as Texas and Oklahoma during the spring migration. It is the second, third and fourth generations that return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring. How the species manages to return to the same overwintering spots over a gap of several generations is still a subject of research; the flight patterns appear to be inherited, based on a combination of [[circadian rhythm]] and the position of the sun in the sky.<ref>

Monarch butterflies are one of the few insects capable of making transatlantic crossings. They are becoming more common in [[Bermuda]] due to increased usage of [[milkweed]] as an ornamental plant in flower gardens. Monarch butterflies born in Bermuda remain year round due to the island's mild climate. 

A few Monarchs turn up in the far southwest of [[Great Britain]] in years when the wind conditions are right. Monarchs can also be found in New Zealand during summer, but are absent the rest of the year. On the island of [[Hawaii]] no migrations have been noted.

Monarchs can live a life of six to eight weeks in a garden having their host ''[[Asclepias]]'' plants and sufficient flowers for nectar.  This is especially true if the flower garden happens to be surrounded by native forest that seems to be lacking in flowers.

== Reproduction ==
[[Image:Monarch Butterfly Danaus plexippus Mating 2150px.jpg|thumb|right|Monarch butterflies mating]]
The mating period for the overwinter population occurs in the spring, just prior to migration from the overwintering sites. The courtship is fairly simple and less dependent on chemical pheromones in comparison with other species in its genus. Courtship is composed of two distinct stages, the aerial phase and the ground phase. During the aerial phase, the male pursues, nudges, and eventually takes down the female. Copulation occurs during the ground phase and involves the transfer of a spermatophore from the male to the female. Along with sperm, the spermatophore is thought to provide the female with energy resources that aid her in carrying out reproduction and remigration.  The overwinter population returns only as far north as they need to go to find the early milkweed growth; in the case of the eastern butterflies that is commonly southern Texas.

Once they reach their breeding grounds, the females lay their eggs on milkweed host plants. The egg and larval period is temperature dependent and lasts about 2 weeks. At the end of this period, the larva enter a period of pupation as a chrysalis for 9 to 15 days, after which an adult butterfly emerges to continue the next step of the annual migration. On some remote islands, the monarch never migrates but remains in the garden where it was "born".

The life cycle of a Monarch includes a change of form called complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The Monarch goes through four radically different stages:

# The eggs are laid by the females during spring and summer breeding months.
# The eggs hatch, revealing worm-like larva, the [[caterpillar]]s.  The caterpillars consume their egg cases, then feed on [[milkweed]], and sequester substances called [[cardenolide]]s, a type of [[cardiac glycoside]]s. During the caterpillar stage, Monarchs store energy in the form of [[fat]] and [[nutrient]]s to carry them through the non-feeding pupa stage.
# In the [[pupa]] or [[Pupa#Chrysalis|chrysalis]] stage, the caterpillar spins a silk pad on a twig, leaf, etc. and hangs from this pad by its last pair of prolegs. It hangs upside down in the shape of a 'J', and then molts, leaving itself encased in an articulated green [[exoskeleton]]. At this point, hormonal changes occur, leading to the development of a butterfly.
# The mature butterfly emerges after about two weeks and feeds on a variety of flowers, including milkweed flowers, red clover, and goldenrod.

==Systematics==
[[Image:albino monarch butterfly.jpg|200px|thumb|left|An albino Monarch butterfly]]
This butterfly is closely related to one or two very similar [[species]] which were formerly considered to form the ''Danaus (Danaus)'' [[subgenus]] (see Smith ''et al.'' 2005). One is the [[Jamaican Monarch]] (''Danaus cleophile'') of [[Jamaica]] and [[Hispaniola]].

The other is a  butterfly which is almost indistinguishable from the Monarch as an adult (the pupae are somewhat more different) and occurs south of the [[Amazonas]] river. This [[taxon]], ''Danaus erippus'' ("[[Southern Monarch]]"), is often considered a [[subspecies]] of the Monarch Butterfly proper. Analysis of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]], [[mtDNA]] 12S [[rRNA]] and [[Cytochrome c oxidase|cytochrome ''c'' oxidase]] [[subunit]] I, and [[nuclear DNA]] 18S rRNA and [[Elongation factor|EF1]] subunit α [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data (Smith ''et al.'' 2005) indicates that it is better considered a distinct species.

However, as a species the Southern Monarch is only comparatively recently [[evolution|evolved]]. In all likelihood, its ancestors separated from the Monarch's population some 2 [[mya (unit)|mya]], at the end of the [[Pliocene]], when [[sea level]]s were higher and the entire Amazonas lowland was a vast expanse of [[brackish]] swampland that offered hardly any butterfly habitat (Smith ''et al.'' 2005).
{{clear}}

Following the review of Smith ''et al.'' (2005), two subspecies are nowadays recognized:

* ''Danaus plexippus plexippus''
*:The migratory subspecies known from most of the USA
* ''Danaus plexippus megalippe''
*:The non-migratory subspecies which is found from [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] southwards, throughout the [[Caribbean]] and [[Central America]] to the [[Amazon River]]. This has several local [[form (zoology)|form]]s:
** ''Danaus plexippus megalippe'' forma ''leucogyne''
** ''Danaus plexippus megalippe'' forma ''portoricensis''
** ''Danaus plexippus megalippe'' forma ''tobagi''

As seen in the photo above, [[albino]] individuals are also occasionally found.

== Defense against predators ==
Monarchs are foul-tasting and poisonous due to the presence of [[cardenolide aglycones]] in their bodies, which the caterpillars ingest as they feed on milkweed. Both forms advertise their unpalatability with bright colors and areas of high contrast on the skin or wings. This phenomenon is known as [[aposematism]].

Monarchs share this defense with the even more unpleasant-tasting and similar-appearing [[Viceroy butterfly]], in an example of Batesian [[mimic]]ry. (Viceroys were at one time believed to be Batesian mimics of Monarchs.)

==Relationship with humans==
The Monarch is the insect of Alabama, Idaho, Illinois, and Texas, and the state butterfly of Minnesota and West Virginia. It was nominated in 1989 as the national insect of the United States of America, and is the national insect of Canada. 

Many people like to attract Monarchs by making a [[Butterfly gardening|butterfly garden]], sometimes referred to as a [http://www.monarchwatch.org/ws/index.html waystation].  Others enjoy raising them for pleasure or for educational purposes. For migrating flocks, sanctuaries have been created at favorite wintering locations; considerable revenue from [[tourism]] is generated thus.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Threats==
[[Image:ButterflyOnFlowerInBotanicalGardens.jpg|thumb|Monarch in Washington, D.C.]]
Recent illegal deforestation of the Monarch's overwintering grounds have led to a drastic reduction in the butterfly's population. Efforts to classify it as a protected species and to restore its habitat are under way. Mexican authorities expected a significant increase in the Monarch population in the 2005-2006 season.

Monarch butterflies are susceptible to ''[[Ophryocystis elektroscirrha]]'', a [[protozoa]]n which parasitizes them. It is present on the abdomen of adult butterflies and passed to their offspring when the spores rub off during egg-laying and are then ingested by the caterpillars. The effects of the parasite on Monarchs include decreased weight, shortened lifespan, weakened wings, rapid weightloss, or inability to close, though this varies between butterfly populations and parasite strains.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Popular culture==
[[The Monarch]] is a [[supervillain]] from the [[Adult Swim]] cartoon ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' He claims to have been raised by Monarch butterflies after surviving a plane crash that killed his parents, although his mannerisms and personality demonstrate almost no knowledge of their biology or behavior.

A monarch butterfly appeared in the [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] episode, [[Wormy]].

An episode of ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' simply entitled "Butterflies" has a plot with Reese raising hundreds of Monarch caterpillars. Eventually, they all become adult butterflies which flock Harrison Lenz's room and begin to cover up Reese, to his horror. Real caterpillars and butterflies were used, though the enormous fluttering flock near the end was done with [[computer-generated imagery]].
