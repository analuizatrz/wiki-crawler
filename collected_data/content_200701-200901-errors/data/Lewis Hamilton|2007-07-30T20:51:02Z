'''Lewis Carl Hamilton''' (born January 7, 1985 in [[Stevenage]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Formula One]] (F1) [[Auto racing#Single-seater racing|driver]]. Hamilton started racing [[karting|karts]] at the age of eight. When he was nine, he approached [[McLaren]] F1 team boss [[Ron Dennis]] at an awards ceremony and told him he would drive for McLaren one day; four years later, Hamilton was signed to the McLaren driver development support programme. Hamilton became European karting champion in 2000 with maximum points and made a successful transition to racing cars the following year. He progressed through the junior formulae, achieving titles in [[Formula Renault]], [[Formula 3]] and [[GP2 series|GP2]]. He was appointed as a Formula One driver for McLaren in 2007. In his first season in the top international single seater category he became the first [[rookie]] driver to lead the world championship, finishing on the podium in his first nine races and winning twice by the mid point of the season.

==Personal and early life==
Hamilton's [[paternal]] grandparents emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] from [[Grenada]] in the 1950s. His grandfather worked on the [[London Underground]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Grenadian roots of first black F1 driver |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2006/11/061127_grenadaf1.shtml |date=[[2006-11-27]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> His mother Carmen and father Anthony, (who is now an IT consultant), named him after the US Olympic gold medal winning athlete [[Carl Lewis]].<ref>Sourced from [[ITV]]'s 2007 Bahrain Grand Prix commentary</ref> Hamilton's parents separated when he was two and, until he was ten, he lived with his mother. After that he lived with his father, step-mother Linda and half-brother Nicholas who has [[cerebral palsy]].

==Racing career==
===Karting===
Hamilton began [[kart racing|karting]] in 1993 at the age of eight,<ref name="BBC_07-06-19">{{cite news

I'm going to race for McLaren". From the Cadet ranks (1993-6), he progressed though the Junior Yamaha (1997) and Junior Intercontinental A (1998-9) divisions, earning him attention from [[McLaren|Team McLaren]], who signed him to the McLaren driver development support programme. This contract included an option of a future F1 seat, thus making Hamilton the youngest ever driver to secure an F1 contract.<ref name="BBC_07-06-19" />

Lewis Hamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In [[Formula A]] and [[Formula Super A]], racing for TeamMBM.com, his team mate was [[Nico Rosberg]], who would later drive for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team in Formula One. Following his karting successes, the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]] made him a ‘Rising Star’ Member in 2000.<ref>{{cite web

Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth overall. This led to a full 2002 [[Formula Renault#United Kingdom|Formula Renault UK]] campaign with Manor Motorsport. Hamilton finished third overall with three wins and three pole positions. He remained with Manor for another year and won the championship with ten wins and 419 points to the two wins and 377 points of this nearest rival, [[Alex Lloyd (racing driver)|Alex Lloyd]]. Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the [[British Formula Three Championship]]. Here he was less successful: in the first race he was forced out with a puncture,<ref>{{cite news

Hamilton and Manor then made their debut in the [[2004]] [[Formula Three Euroseries]]. They won just one race and Hamilton was fifth in the championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix and raced one of the [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau F3 Grand Prix]]. Hamilton first tested for [[McLaren]] in late 2004, at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].<ref>{{cite news

He moved to reigning Euroseries champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds. He also won the [[Ultimate Masters of Formula 3|Marlboro Masters of Formula 3]] at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]].<ref>{{cite news

After the season, British magazine ''[[Autosport]]'' featured him in their “Top 50 Drivers of 2005” issue, ranking Hamilton 24th. After Hamilton's success in Formula Three, he was signed by [[ART Grand Prix]] for the [[2006 GP2 Series season]]. Like ASM in F3, ART were the class of the field and reigning champions having taken the 2005 GP2 crown with [[Nico Rosberg]]. Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt.

Among his notable performances was a dominant win at the fifth round held at the [[Nürburgring]], despite serving a penalty for speeding in the [[pit stop|pit lane]]. At his home race at [[Silverstone]], supporting the [[British Grand Prix]], Hamilton impressed again by overtaking two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed (up to 150&nbsp;mph in a GP2 car) bends where overtaking is rare. He demonstrated his overtaking prowess again at the race in Istanbul, when he recovered from a spin that left him 18th, to take second place in the final corners. He became GP2 champion in unusual circumstances. [[Giorgio Pantano]] won the penultimate race at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], and set the fastest lap on the final lap, initially taking this bonus point from Hamilton. However, it transpired that he had set this under a yellow flag, indicating to the officials that he had not slowed enough to avoid potential danger, leading to him losing the fastest lap, which therefore gave Hamilton the single point he needed to clinch the title.<ref>{{cite web

Hamilton has been widely praised. [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team boss [[Frank Williams]] described him as "superhuman", while triple world champions [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Niki Lauda]] are among those who have speculated that Hamilton could win the 2007 championship. Ex-[[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] owner [[Eddie Jordan]] disagreed, believing that while Hamilton has exceptional talent, he will not win the championship this season. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher said that Hamilton's potential was evident during his GP2 season, but he was surprised at the consistency Hamilton has shown so early in his career.<ref name="schumacher video">{{cite video|url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8q1g6aP18|title = Michael Schumacher on Lewis Hamilton| medium =Youtube | publisher = Sky News | accessdate = 2007-06-12| date = 2007-04-23}} </ref> However, Hamilton suffered criticism from former driver and [[1997 Formula One season|1997]] champion [[Jacques Villeneuve]], who accused him of "chopping" at the start of Grands Prix.

Controversy surrounded Hamilton's finishing position in [[2007 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]]. After comments made by Hamilton post-race which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA initiated an inquiry to determine whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders. McLaren denied favouring double world champion [[Fernando Alonso]], and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that: "McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars. They did nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result."<ref>{{cite news| title =FIA McLaren-Monaco Full statement | publisher =Formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/news/6178.html| date =[[2007-05-30]]| accessdate =2007-06-05}}</ref>

[[Image:Hamilton leading Silverstone 2007.jpg|thumb|Hamilton took pole position at the [[2007 British Grand Prix]], but faded to third place in the race. Nevertheless, it was his ninth consecutive podium finish.]]

Hamilton gained the first [[pole position]] of his F1 career in the [[2007 Canadian Grand Prix]]. On race day, Hamilton led almost continuously from start to finish, despite having his lead cut on the four occasions the safety car was deployed. The win strengthened his championship challenge.<ref>{{cite news| title =Canadian Grand Prix | publisher =BBC Sport| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6739373.stm| date =[[2007-06-10]]| accessdate =2007-06-11}}</ref> A week later, Hamilton won the [[2007 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]] also from pole position, becoming the first Briton since [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] in [[1983 United States Grand Prix West|1983]] to win a Formula One World Championship race in the US, and only the second person to win more than one race in his first F1 Championship season since the first year of the Championship itself. 

By finishing third at [[2007 French Grand Prix|Magny-Cours]] behind [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] drivers [[Kimi Räikkönen]] and Felipe Massa, Hamilton extended his lead in the Driver's Championship to 14 points. This was the first time in his F1 career that he finished a race in a lower position than he started, and the first time he had been passed on the racetrack in Formula One. At [[2007 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]], Hamilton's home Grand Prix, he started from pole and led for the first 16 laps of the race. He was unable to maintain this pace for the full race, finishing 40 seconds behind Räikkönen and Alonso but still leading the championship.

During final qualifying for the [[2007 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]], Hamilton crashed heavily at the renamed [[Nürburgring#1984: The new Grand Prix track|Schumacher chicane]] after a problem with the [[Lug nut|wheel nut]] air gun caused the wheel to be incorrectly fitted.<ref name="canada.com">{{cite news| title =Hamilton unhurt but uncertain for race| publisher =canada.com| url =http://www.canada.com/topics/sports/story.html?id=c1e59613-294c-4a77-abf3-30356bada34d&k=31118| date =[[2007-07-21]]| accessdate =2007-07-21}}</ref> He was taken to the [[Nürburgring|circuit's]] medical centre on a stretcher with an oxygen mask and drip, but was conscious throughout.<ref name="reuterscrash"/><ref>{{cite news| title =Hamilton crashes in qualifying for European Grand Prix, taken away in ambulance| publisher =iht.com| url =http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/21/sports/EU-SPT-CAR-F1-European-GP-Hamilton.php| date =[[2007-07-21]]| accessdate =2007-07-21}}</ref> As he did not set a representative lap time in the final session, he qualified in tenth position.<ref>{{cite news| title =Raikkonen storms to pole as Hamilton crashes out| publisher =formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/7/6508.html| date =[[2007-07-21]]| accessdate =2007-07-21}}</ref> After a final medical check on Sunday morning, Hamilton was cleared to race.<ref>{{cite news| title =Hamilton cleared to race in the Euro GP| publisher =itv-f1.com| url =http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=40127| date =[[2007-07-22]]| accessdate =2007-07-22}}</ref> During a heavy rainstorm which caused the race to be red-flagged, Hamilton slid off into a gravel trap. However as he kept his engine running he was lifted back on to the circuit and able rejoin the race after the restart. His 9th place finish in this race was both his first non-podium and non-points finish, enabling title contenders Alonso and Massa to reduce Hamilton's lead in the Driver's Championship.
