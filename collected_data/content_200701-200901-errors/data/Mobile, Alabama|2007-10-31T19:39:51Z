==History==
{{See also|History of Mobile, Alabama}}
The settlement of Mobile, then known as [[Old Mobile Site|''Fort Louis de La Mobile'']], was first established in [[1702]], at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the [[Mobile River]], as the first capital of the [[French colonial empires|French colony]] of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. This period also saw the arrival of the first [[African]] [[slaves]] aboard a French supply ship from [[Saint-Domingue]]<ref>Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 21. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>.  Following [[yellow fever]] outbreaks and a series of floods, the town was relocated downriver to its present location at the confluence of the [[Mobile River]] and [[Mobile Bay]] in [[1711]].<ref>Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 17-27. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  A new earth and palisade ''Fort Louis'' was constructed at the new site during this time.<ref name=MoMfort>"Other Locations: Historic Fort Conde" (history),Museum of Mobile, Mobile, Alabama, 2006, webpage:[http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php MoM-Other]</ref>  The capital of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] was moved to [[Biloxi]] in [[1720]],<ref name=MoMfort/> leaving Mobile relegated to the role of trading post.  In [[1723]] the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began<ref name=MoMfort/>, and was renamed as [[Fort Conde|Fort Condé]] in honor of [[Louis Henri, Duc de Bourbon]] and [[Princes of Condé|prince of Condé]].<ref name="conde1"|>{{cite web|title="Historic Fort Conde"|work="Museum of Mobile"|url=http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>
[[Image:West Florida Map 1767.jpg|thumb|left|The expanded West Florida territory in 1767.]]
In 1763, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, ending the [[French and Indian War]]/[[Seven Years' War]]. The treaty [[ceded]] Mobile and the surrounding territory to [[Great Britain]], who made it into the expanded [[West Florida]] colony.<ref name="setmob1">{{cite web|title="Early European Conquests and the Settlement of Mobile"|work="Alabama Department of Archives and History"|url=http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec02qs.html|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref>   The British renamed the city [[Fort Charlotte (Mobile)|Fort Charlotte]], after the English queen<ref name="setmob2">{{cite web|title="Mobile: Alabama's Tricentennial City"|work="Alabama Department of Archives and History"|url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/mobile/mobile3.html|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref>, and re-energized the port. Major exports included timber, naval stores, indigo, hides, rice, pecans and cattle.

[[Battle of Fort Charlotte|The Spanish captured]] the port town in [[1780]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]] at the invitation of the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen "United Colonies"]] due to the fact that [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the [[British Crown]].<ref>Delaney, Caldwell. ''The Story of Mobile'', page 45. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN 0940882140</ref>  The fort was renamed as [[Fort Conde|Fortaleza Carlota]], and the Spanish held Mobile as a part of Spanish [[West Florida]] until [[1813]], when the weakly defended port city was seized by the U.S. General [[James Wilkinson]] during the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="wilkinson">{{cite web|title="James Wilkinson"|work="War of 1812"|url=http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/people/wilkinson.html|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref>

From the [[1830s]] onward Mobile expanded into a city of commerce.  During the [[American Civil War]], Mobile was a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] city.  The first [[submarine]] to successfully sink an enemy ship, the [[Hunley|H. L. Hunley]], was built in Mobile.<ref name="Hunley">{{cite web|title="H. L. Hunley"|work="Naval Historical Center"|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org12-3.htm|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref>   One of the most famous [[naval engagement]]s of the [[American Civil War|war]] was the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] in [[1864]], resulting in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] taking possession of [[Mobile Bay]] on [[5 August]] [[1864]].<ref name="newhist1">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 113. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  On [[12 April]] [[1865]], the city surrendered to the [[Union army]] to avoid destruction following the Union victories at the [[Battle of Spanish Fort]] and the [[Battle of Fort Blakely]].<ref name="newhist1">  Ironically, on [[25 May]] [[1865]], the city suffered loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an explosion at a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[ammunition depot]] on Beauregard Street.  The explosion left a 30 foot deep hole at the depot's location, sunk ships docked on the [[Mobile River]], and the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city.<ref>Delaney, Caldwell.

[[Image:LOC2.jpg|thumb|left|The Mobile waterfront in 1906.]]

[[World War II]] led to a massive military effort causing a considerable increase in Mobile's population, largely due to the huge influx of workers coming into Mobile to work in the shipyards and at the [[Mobile Downtown Airport|Brookley Army Air Field]].<ref name="thomason2">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 213-217. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  Between [[1940]] and [[1943]] 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.<ref name="thomason2"/>  Mobile was one of eighteen U.S. cities producing [[Liberty ships]] at its [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] to support the war effort by producing ships faster than the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] could sink them.<ref name="thomason2"/>  [[Chickasaw Shipyard Village Historic District|Gulf Shipbuilding]] focused on building [[freighter]]s, [[Fletcher class destroyer]]s, and [[minesweeper]]s.<ref name="thomason2"/>  The [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] brought about post war changes in Mobile's economy. Mobile's downtown was the recipient of [[urban renewal]] and saw the [[demolition]] of some of the city's oldest buildings.  Instead of shipbuilding, the paper and chemical industries began to take over as the primary economic force and most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses.

==Geography==
Mobile is located at 30°40'46" North, 88°6'12" West (30.679523, -88.103280).{{GR|1}} This is in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Alabama.

Mobile's&nbsp;geographical location on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] provides a mild [[subtropical]] [[climate]], with an average annual temperature of 67.5°F. January through December temperatures range from 40°F min. and 91°F max.

Mobile's French, British, Spanish, African, Creole and Catholic heritage distinguish it from all others in the state of Alabama. The city is home to an array of cultural influences.  The annual [[Mardi Gras]] celebration is perhaps the best illustration of this.  Mardi Gras in Mobile has evolved over the course of 300 years from a sedate French Catholic tradition into a mainstream multi-week celebration across the spectrum of cultures and religions.

===Mardi Gras===
{{see also|Mardi Gras in Mobile}}
Mobile first celebrated [[Mardi Gras]] in [[1703]] when French settlers began the festivities at the [[Old Mobile Site]]. Mobile's first Mardi Gras society was organized in [[1711]] with the ''Boeuf Gras Society''.<ref name=MMtime>"Carnival/Mobile Mardi Gras Timeline" (list of events),The Museum of Mobile, 2002, webpage:[http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/mardi_gras_timeline.php MoM-timeline](events at 1850).</ref>  The idea of mystic societies was exported to [[New Orleans]] in [[1856]] when six businessmen, formerly of Mobile, gathered at a club room in New Orleans' French Quarter to organize a secret society that would observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade.  They founded New Orleans' first and oldest mystic society, the ''[[Mistick Krewe of Comus]]''.<ref name="LaCour">Arthur B. LaCour, ''New Orleans Masquerade:  Chronicles of Carnival'' (Pelican Publishing 1952)</ref>  Part of their inspiration was a Mobile mystic society, the ''Cowbellion de Rakin Society'', which was the first formally organized ([[1830]]) and masked mystic society in the United States to celebrate with a parade.<ref name=MMtime/>  

In [[1845]] Mobile passed the first city ordinance prohibiting free blacks and slaves from holding balls at their place of residence, though this did not include the city's [[Creole peoples|Creole]] population.<ref name=MMtime/>  Mardi Gras celebrations in Mobile were cancelled for several years during the American Civil War.  Mardi Gras parades were revived by [[Joe Cain]] in [[1866]] when he paraded through the city streets on [[Fat Tuesday]] while costumed as a fictional [[Chickasaw]] chief named ''Slacabamorinico'', irreverently celebrating the day in front of the occupying [[Union Army]] troops.<ref name=JChist>

</ref>  The Mobile Carnival Association was formed in [[1871]] to coordinate the events of Mardi Gras.  The ''Continental Mystic Crew'' mystic society was founded in [[1890]], it was Mobile's first Jewish mystic society.<ref name=MMtime/>  The ''Order of Doves'' mystic society was founded in [[1894]] and held its first Mardi Gras ball. It was the first organized Arican American mystic society in Mobile.<ref name=MMtime/>  The Colored Carnival Association was founded and had its first parade in [[1939]], it would later be renamed the Mobile Area Mardi Gras Association.<ref name=MMtime/>

Mardi Gras in Mobile is known for its family-friendly celebration, in contrast to the sometimes bawdy celebration seen in New Orleans.<ref name="mbcvb1">{{cite web|title="Mardi Gras"|work="Mobile Bay Convention and Visitors Bureau"|url=http://www.mobile.org/vis_mardigras.php|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref>  The mystic societies build colorful Mardi Gras floats and parade through downtown Mobile during the weeks preceding Mardi Gras day with masked society members tossing small trinkets, known as ''throws'', to the parade spectators.  Mobile's mystic societies also feature formal masked balls, which are oriented to adults.  The Mardi Gras celebrations end promptly at the stroke of midnight on [[Fat Tuesday]], signaling the beginning of [[Ash Wednesday]] and the first day of [[Lent]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Houston |authorlink= |title=Mobile; It Has History |work=The News & Observer  |publisher=News & Observer Publishing Company, (Raleigh, NC) |date=2007-02-04 |accessdate=2007-05-22 }} </ref>
