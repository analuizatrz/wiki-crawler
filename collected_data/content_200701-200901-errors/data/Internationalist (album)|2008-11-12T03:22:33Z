'''''Internationalist''''' is the third [[studio album]] by Australian [[alternative rock]] [[rock band|band]], [[Powderfinger]]. The album was released on 7 September 1998 and was often labelled Powderfinger's most adventurous work, with greater [[experimentation]] than in previous works.

''Internationalist'' followed in the success of its predecessor, ''[[Double Allergic]]'', and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|five times platinum]] in Australia. ''Internationalist'' received four [[ARIA Music Awards]], including "Album of the Year". The album produced four singles for the band; "[[The Day You Come]]", "[[Don't Wanna Be Left Out]]/[[Good-Day Ray]]", "[[Already Gone (Powderfinger song)|Already Gone]]" and "[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]", which all appeared on [[Triple J]]'s [[Triple J Hottest 100|Hottest 100]] poll in two consecutive years.

''Internationalist'' received fairly positive reviewers in the Australian press, and cemented Powderfinger's position on the local music scene; however, the album failed to launch the band in the overseas market.

== Background ==
Powderfinger spent much of early 1997 [[concert|touring]], after the success of ''[[Double Allergic]]''. Songwriter [[Bernard Fanning]] then spent much of 1997 writing songs for ''Internationalist'' in [[Brisbane]], drawing on inspiration from a mid-1997 band trip to the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hot Ticket|publisher=''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''|date=2 November 1997|author=Fountaine, Angus}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/article9.htm --></ref>

The album's title refers to [[escapism]]—namely, the ability that an "[[wikt:internationalist|internationalist]]" has to escape from [[racism|racial]] and [[sociology|social]] tension. When asked in a ''Juice'' interview, [[Bernard Fanning]] summarised the title of the album by stating;
{{cquote|It’s about the idea of all this tension that is around at the moment, all this racial and political tension...The idea is that an ‘internationalist’ has an escape from all that. Music can be a vehicle for that escape.<ref name=TakingFlight />}}

== Recording and production ==
''Internationalist'' was recorded at [[Melbourne]]'s Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by American [[record producer|producer]] [[Nick DiDia]] for the first time. As the band had already prepared "about 30 or 40" songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. [[Bassist]] [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]] said of DiDia; "Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was that he wanted to record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didn’t want to play around too much."<ref name=TakingFlight />  As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was [[Audio mixing|mixed]] by DiDia soon after.<ref name=TakingFlight>{{cite news|title=Taking Flight|publisher=''Juice''|author=Clode, Samantha|date=October 1998}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl38.htm --></ref>  Powderfinger used the extra time to play [[table tennis]], which was the band's recreation of choice during the ''Internationalist'' and ''[[Odyssey Number Five]]'' recording sessions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mission Impossible|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|date=August 2000}}<!-- http://www.hindleysite.com/media/mag/Powderfinger_rollingstone_missionimpossible.htm --></ref>

Collins described the album as not being as easy listening as their previous work,<ref name=TakingFlight /> and that it contained numerous experiments in songwriting that they had not put into previous albums.<ref name=TakingFlight /> Fanning later said ''Internationalist'' was "a better record" than ''[[Double Allergic]]'', but acknowledged that it was not as easily likeable—it was just an improvement in songwriting.<ref name=Glory /> Collins and Fanning acknowledged that the album's experimental nature could lose them some old fans, but the pair drew parallels with bands such as [[U2]], who Collins said had "constantly re-invented themselves, and with success".<ref name=TakingFlight /> He said Powderfinger's reinvention was as much for the band's own interest as it was for the "public's perception".<ref name=TakingFlight /> Meanwhile, [[guitarist]] [[Ian Haug]] described the album as a "moderation" between ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]'' ("the complicated beast") and ''Double Allergic'' ("totally simplified"), Powderfinger's two previous albums.<ref name=BeckoningFinger>{{cite news|title=The Beckoning Finger|publisher=''Juice''|author=Watts, Benedict|date=November 1998}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl37.htm --></ref> He also agreed that the album was much more experimental, and described the album as the band's "most successful", as well as stating that the album that best replicated "the sound we have live".<ref name=AI>{{cite news|title=Allergic Internationalists|publisher=''hEARd Online Music Magazine''|year=1999}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl21.htm --></ref>

Numerous songs on ''Internationalist'' were [[politics|politically]] and [[sociology|socially]] influenced, although the band denied it being a deliberate [[Motif (narrative)|motif]].<ref name=TPolitics /> Fanning explaining that the band did not intentionally discuss political issues, saying "we don't try to do anything in particular".<ref name=TPolitics /> He noted, however, that the songs, as his emotional responses to recent events, could inevitably be interpreted as being political.<ref name=TPolitics>{{cite news|title=Talkin' Politics?|publisher=''Beat''|author=Johnson, Neala|date=December 1998}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl12.htm --></ref> When "[[The Day You Come]]" was released, there was speculation that it alluded to [[Pauline Hanson]]'s [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] [[political party]], although the band claimed the song was vague and didn't specifically refer to one person. Fanning said of "The Day You Come";
{{cquote|I wouldn't certainly say that we've written any protest songs – "The Day You Come" is the closest to that kind of song, and that typically, like most of our songs can be construed in many ways. And  it was particularly about the way Australian electorate I suppose is moving, and thinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/songs/dayoutcome.htm|title=Day You Come (The)|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref>}}

== Single releases ==
{{Sound sample box align right|Music sample:}}
{{Listen|filename=Powderfinger-Don't_Wanna_be_Left_Out-18s.ogg|title="Don't Wanna Be Left Out"|description=An 18-second sample from "Don't Wanna Be Left Out", which was described as "one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date".<ref name=Feted />|format=[[Ogg]]}}

{{sample box end}}

The first single from the album was "[[The Day You Come]]", a politically and socially influenced song that mused about [[Pauline Hanson]]'s [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] party. The band did not intend for it to be the first single, and released it only when they could not decide on anything else. Haug said it being "a pretty inoffensive song musically" helped Powderfinger make that decision.<ref name=BeckoningFinger /> "The Day You Come" spent nine weeks on the [[ARIA Charts]], peaking at #25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=286146&cat=s|title=Powderfinger - The Day You Come|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref>

The second single was the double [[a-side]], "[[Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray]]", released on 9 November 1998. "Don't Wanna Be Left Out", a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, was one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date.<ref name=Feted /> Drummer [[Jon Coghill]] described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so "fast and offbeat".<ref name=Cogsy>{{cite web|title=Powderfinger (Int. With Jon Coghill)|url=http://www.australianmusician.com.au/mag/spring99/powderfinger.html|publisher=''[[Australian Musician]]''|month=September | year=1999|author=Eliezer, Christie|accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref> The music video for "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" was unpopular and drew criticism from band members.<ref name=BestOf /> "Good-Day Ray" was dedicated to Australian television presenter [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]] and his public disagreements with former ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' host [[Stuart Littlemore]]. Its lyrics verged on [[punk rock|punk]], though Coghill denied that Powderfinger were a punk band.<ref name=Feted>{{cite news|title=Fingers feted at home|author=Yorke, Ritchie|date=15 November 1998|publisher=''[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]]''}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl15.htm --></ref> He also described the [[music video]] for "Good-Day Ray" as being one of the better videos the band had made.<ref name=Cogsy />

''Internationalist'''s third single was "[[Already Gone (Powderfinger song)|Already Gone]]", released on 12 February 1999. The song was a tribute to [[The Beatles]] and their influence on Powderfinger's music.<ref name=BestOf>[[Powderfinger]] (2004). ''[[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000]]'' companion booklet.</ref> The fourth and final single from the album was "[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]", released on 9 August 1999.  "Passenger" was influenced by [[Elvis Presley]], and included a [[horn (music)|big horn]] section, as well as backing vocals from [[folk music|folk]] group [[Tiddas]].<ref name=P2K>{{cite news|title=Primed for P2K Tour|author=Pascuzzi, Carmine |publisher=''Media Search''}}</ref> "Passenger" won the [[ARIA Awards|ARIA Award]] for "Song Of The Year" in 1999.<ref name=Jackets>{{cite news|title=Trusty Old Jackets|publisher=''Massive''|author=Yates, Rod|date=September 2000|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films.<ref name=P2K /><ref name="fifty">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiftyfifty.tv/cgi-bin/CMS.pl?T=1&P=0|title=www.fiftyfifty.tv|publisher=Fifty Fifty films|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> "Passenger" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=286152&cat=s|title=Powderfinger - Passenger|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref> It appeared at #48 on [[Max (channel)|Max]]'s top 100 songs from the 90s list.<Ref>{{cite web|url=http://maxtv.com.au/Max/Article.aspx?id=1282 |title=MAX's Top 500 90s Songs - Essential 100|publisher=[[Max (channel)|MAX]]|accessdate=2008-08-10|date=2 August 2007}}</ref>

== Touring and promotion ==
Powderfinger went on a nationwide tour after the release of ''Internationalist'', performing with [[United Kingdom|British]] band [[Swervedriver]] and fellow Brisbane band [[Not From There]] in capital cities across Australia.<ref name=Feted /><ref name=Fish /> In 1999, the band also toured with [[Something for Kate]] and [[Alex Lloyd]].<ref name=Glory>{{cite news|title=Powder And The Glory|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|pages=3|author=Mathieson, Craig|date=23 July 1999}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl20.htm --></ref> Collins described the process of choosing who the band would play with as a simple matter of choosing whose music the band preferred, stating "we had played with most of the bands, and if you're going on tour with someone you may as well go with someone you get along with and whose music you enjoy."<ref name=Fish /> Despite being fans of Swervedriver, who were renowned for "their capability to reproduce their album sound perfectly in the live setting" according to ''Beat'''s Neala Johnson,<ref name=TPolitics /> Fanning said Powderfinger would never attempt to replicate them, because he believed their live shows to be much more "emotionally powerful" than recordings.<ref name=TPolitics />

With ''Internationalist'', Powderfinger first set their sights overseas, appearing at numerous [[music festival]]s in the U.S., including [[South by Southwest]] in [[Texas]].<ref name=Dream>{{cite news|title=Day Dream Believers|publisher=''[[The Courier-Mail]]''|author=Six, Nicola|date=19 November 1998}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl16.htm --></ref> While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]]. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult due to the lack of any homegrown fan support.  He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as he had hoped.<ref name=Pulse>{{cite news|title=Finger On The Pulse|publisher=''HIT''|author=Bolster, Teresa|date=December 1998}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl13.htm --></ref> Coghill, however, described the showcases, and the performances in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], as "worthwhile" and "fun".<ref name=P2K /> After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of Canada. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as "people [in Australia] are going to get sick of you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially."<ref name=Dream />

== Reception ==
''Internationalist'' debuted at the top of the [[ARIA Albums Chart]], and was [[Music recording sales certification|certified gold]] in its first week, selling over 35,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-1998.htm|title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 1998 Albums|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> It then went on to go platinum,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-1999.htm|title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 1999 Albums|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> and is currently certified platinum five times, for 350,000 copies.<ref name=2007albums>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/httpwww.aria.com.aupagesARIACharts-Accreditations-2007Albums.htm |title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 2007 Albums|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> At the 1999 [[ARIA Awards]], the album received three awards—"Album of the Year", "Best Rock Album", and "Best Cover Art". "The Day You Come" also won "Single of the Year". In 2000, "Passenger" was nominated for three awards, but did not win any.<ref name="ARIA-history" />

Haug said he was amazed with the highly positive critical response the album had received, surprised that "even Molly <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Molly Meldrum|Meldrum]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> gave it nine out of ten." The positivity of the album's reception created a feeling of surrealism, and Haug told ''Juice'' "I wish someone would write a really bad [review]."<ref name=BeckoningFinger /> Nonetheless, he appreciated the credibility the album helped Powderfinger develop.<ref name=BeckoningFinger /> Coghill agreed with Haug on the album's popularity, stating "you couldn't ask for much better", and saying he really took notice of the album's positive critical commentary.<ref name=Feted /> ''Juice''{{'}}s Benedict Watts said it received "a level of universal praise not yet dished out on an Australian release since [[You Am I]]'s ''[[Hi Fi Way]]''".<ref name=BeckoningFinger />  Despite [[Polydor]] telling the band the album would be heavily marketed, Fanning still found its success surprising.<ref name=Fish>{{cite news|title=Fish Tales|publisher=Juice|author=Clode, Samantha|date=December 1998}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl11.htm --></ref> ''HIT''{{'}}s Teresa Bolster suggested Fanning feared the worst during songwriting; "Celebrity Head", a song on the album, was seen as a "pre-emptive, scathing attack on music writers", which he argued was intended as a joke.<ref name=Pulse />

''Internationalist''{{'}}s critical reception was positive, following in its chart success. ''[[The Courier-Mail]]''{{'}}s Nicola Six called it the band's most diverse album yet, using "The Day You Come" as an example; its "opening [[staccato]] guitar [[riff]] to the way the bass blends with Bernard Fanning's almost-[[falsetto]] in the final chorus" made it the "perfect first single".<ref name=Dream /> Watts said it "brilliantly pre-empts the mood and progressive nature of the album",<ref name=BeckoningFinger /> and [[Allmusic]]'s Jonathan Lewis described it as the best track on the album.<ref name=AMG>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hbftxq8jldje |title=Internationalist > Review|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|author=Lewis, Jonathan|accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref> ''[[The Weekend Australian]]'''s Iain Shedden said it was "one of the best Australian rock songs of the decade".<ref name=UpClose>{{cite news|title=Up Close (And Not Too) Personal|publisher=''[[The Weekend Australian]]''|author=Shedden, Iain|date=10 July 1999}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl17.htm --></ref>

"The Day You Come" was not the only single to draw praise; "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" was described as "surf guitar-fuelled",<ref name=Dream /> "Good Day Ray" as "thrashy", and ''HIT'''s  Teresa Bolster wrote that the released of the two as an a-side displayed the album's true scope to the public.<ref name=Pulse /> Allmusic approved of the "rocking" "Don't Wanna Be Left Out", but said Powderfinger sacrificed their uniqueness on "Good Day Ray", which Lewis argued was heavily [[Foo Fighters]] influenced.<ref name=AMG /> Lewis approved of the "melodic" "Already Gone",<ref name=AMG /> while ''Juice''{{'}}s Simon Wooldridge said it and "Passenger" demonostrated Powderfinger's "flair for the big hook".<ref name=Sporting>{{cite news|title=This Sporting Life|publisher=''Juice''|author=Wooldridge, Simon|date=September 2000}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl39.htm --></ref>

''Beat'''s Neala Johnson compared the album's political motifs to the [[Manic Street Preachers]]—"an earnest, sometimes cynical, social and personal conscience displayed in the lyrics".<ref name=TPolitics /> Noel Mangel of ''The Courier-Mail'' said it had "a lightness of touch and boisterous spirit", especially compared to the distorted guitars on debut album ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]''.<ref name=Budding>{{cite news|title=Budding Internationalists|author=Mangel, Noel|publisher=''[[The Courier-Mail]]''|date=16 November 1999}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl24.htm --></ref> ''[[Time Off]]''{{'}}s Geoff Nicholson said ''Internationalist'' was "a blend of shimmering pop songs and thought-provoking probing".<ref name=Keel>{{cite news|title=Keeping An Even Keel |publisher=''[[Time Off]]''|author=Nicholson, Geoof|date=17 November 1999}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl23.htm --></ref>
