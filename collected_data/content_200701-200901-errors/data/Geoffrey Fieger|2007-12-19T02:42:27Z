Fieger is also known for his abrasive nature, which included public accusations against current Michigan Attorney General [[Mike Cox]], who was involved in an extramarital affair.  During the 1998 Michigan governor's race, he insinuated that his Republican opponent was the product of a human/animal mating.  He also was reported to have said, "rabbis are closer to Nazis than they think." <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces98/stories/mi092498.htm ''Brash Candidate a Problem in Michigan'' - WashingtonPost.com], 9/24/98</ref>

Fieger appeared as one of the attorneys on the [[reality TV]] show ''[[Power of Attorney (TV series)|Power of Attorney]]'', and was opposing counsel in an episode of NBC's ''[[The Law Firm]]''. He is developing another reality show, ''[[Fieger and Associates]]''.

Fieger was involved with other high profile cases:
*He represented the family of [[Scott Amedure]] against ''[[Jenny Jones (talk show)|The Jenny Jones Show]]''.
*He defended Ralf Panitz, a guest who appeared on a segment of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' that aired called "Secret Mistresses Confronted" with his new wife Eleanor Panitz and ex-wife Nancy Campbell-Panitz, convicted of murdering his ex-wife Nancy Campbell-Panitz in July 2000. He was considering representing Nancy Campbell-Panitz's sons, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit against [[Jerry Springer]], his producers, and his distributors in July 2002.  Both Gary & Jeffrey Campbell claim that Springer created "a mood that led to murder".
*On [[April 10]] [[2006]], Fieger announced that he plans to file suit against the City of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] for not taking seriously a 911 call by Robert Turner, a 6 year old boy, resulting in the death of his mother, Sherrill.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/04/10/911.lawsuit/index.html ''Suit filed over boy's ignored 911 call'' - CNN.com], 4/10/06</ref>
* One day following the announcement of the Turner case, he announced that he is also representing Lorraine Hayes, who called 911 on [[January 12]] [[2005]], because her boyfriend shot her in the head and chest. Her call was ignored, and as a result she became paralyzed from the waist down <ref>[http://www.wxyz.com/wxyz/nw_local_news/article/0,2132,WXYZ_15924_4612957,00.html ''Second 911 Lawsuit'' - WXYZ News],  4/11/06</ref>.

Fieger is the older brother of [[Doug Fieger]], lead vocalist of the late-70s/early-80s rock group [[The Knack]], best known for their hit song, ''[[My Sharona]]''.

Fieger graduated from the Detroit College of Law, now the [[Michigan State University College of Law]], where he donated four million dollars to start the nation's first trial practice institute for law students, which was named the Geoffrey Fieger Trial Practice Institute in his honor.<ref>[http://newsroom.msu.edu/site/indexer/861/content.htm ''Gift Establishes First Institute For Law Students'' - newsroom.msu.com], 9/08/07</ref>

In 2005 a federal grand jury began investigating Fieger regarding allegations that he, his employees, their families, and law firm vendors donated more than $100,000 to the 2004 Democratic presidential campaign of John Edwards in violation of federal election laws.  On August 21, 2007 the grand jury returned a 30-page, 10-count indictment against Fieger and his law partner Ven Johnson, charging Fieger with conspiracy, obstruction of justice, making illegal campaign contributions and causing false statements.
