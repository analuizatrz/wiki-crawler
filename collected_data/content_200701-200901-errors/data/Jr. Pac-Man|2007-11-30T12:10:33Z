'''''Jr. Pac-Man''''' is an [[arcade game]] released in [[1983]] by [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]].  It is based on ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and its derivatives, but is not officially part of the ''Pac-Man'' series &mdash; along with ''[[Baby Pac-Man]]'', this game was created without the authorization of [[Namco]].  This was one of the games that eventually led to the termination of the [[license|licensing agreement]] between Namco and Midway.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of ''Jr. Pac-Man'' is largely identical to that of its predecessors, with a few differences.  The maze is now two times the width of the display, and a virtual camera pans left and right along the maze to follow Jr. Pac-Man, sometimes resulting in the ghosts being off-screen.  A total of seven mazes appear throughout the game, and unlike previous ''Pac-Man'' games, none of the mazes have tunnels that wrap from one side of the screen to the other.

As in prior games, bonus prizes appear in each level.  (These prizes were called fruits in ''Pac-Man'', but none of the prizes in this game are fruits.)  Similar to ''Ms. Pac-Man'', prizes appear in the middle of the maze and bounce around for a time, but as a prize encounters dots, it changes them into larger dots that slow Jr. Pac-Man down but are worth more points.  If not eaten beforehand, a prize self-destructs with an energizer (also known as a "power pellet"), taking the energizer with it.

There are also a few cosmetic differences: The main character is Jr. Pac-Man (who wears a [[beanie|propeller beanie]]); Clyde, the orange ghost, is now called Tim; and the game's graphics and sound have been updated, including a lower-case [[anti-aliased]] [[font]] for scores and game text.  The game's intermissions center around the developing relationship between Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum (apparently the daughter of Blinky).

==Home versions==
Between the effects of the [[video game crash of 1983]] and the unauthorized status of this game, the only sanctioned port of this game was released for the [[Atari 2600]] in [[1987]] with a 1984 copyright date.  It is generally considered a faithful port of the arcade game, especially given the console's limitations.  A version for the [[Atari 5200]] was nearly completed, but was never officially released.  A [[Read-only memory|ROM]] image for this game can be played with an [[emulator]].

A similar game called ''[[Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures#Side quests|Pac-Jr.]]'' was released as a minigame in the [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] version of ''[[Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures]]'' in [[1994]].  This version is an official release by [[Namco]] and bears only a passing resemblance to ''Jr. Pac-Man'', playing much more like ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'' instead.
