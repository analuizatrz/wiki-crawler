'''Eone Odile Harington''' (born [[1961]]) was an alleged [[South Africa]]n agent. 

==Early life==
Harington lived in [[Johannesburg]]. At the age of 23 Harington was an agent of South African [[military intelligence]] and was sent to [[Zimbabwe]] to infiltrate the [[African National Congress]] and to send back plans of the organizations' buildings in [[Harare]].

==Arrest and trial==
Harington was detected, arrested by police and interrogated by the [[Central Intelligence Organization]]. At her trial before the [[Zimbabwe High Court]] in November 1987 Odile testified that she had been [[torture]]d before February 1987 at a place called [[Daventry]] House, while she was being held at [[Mabelreign]] police station in Harare, and after May 1987 at the CIO detention centre in [[Goromonzi]]. She described repeated [[sexual assault]]s, severe beatings, burnings with cigarettes and other humiliating treatment. She alleged that when she was tortured at Daventry House the ANC official who had been her superior took part. According to her testimony, the ANC official beat her on the soles of the feet with a [[hosepipe]] and half-drowned her by ducking her head repeatedly in a container of water. This evidence was not challenged in court. Chief Justice [[Dumbutshena]] cited her torture in mitigation when he reduced her sentence on appeal.

Odile was sentenced to 25 years in jail on November 27, 1987. On December 3, 1987, the South Africa Commissioner of Police said that Odile was not a spy and had not received any training or compensation. [http://70.84.171.10/~etools/newsbrief/1996/news1127]

==Release and return to South Africa==
[[Clandestine Radio Watch]] cited a report from ''[[Clandestine Calling]]'' magazine in December 1990 linking the closure of [[Radio Truth]] to Odile's release. Sources in Harare stated that she was handed to South African officials on November 1, 1990,  and flown to South Africa within hours. Odile had spent about six and a half years in jail when released. Her release followed years of pressure by South African officials.  

The report stated that no confirmation of Odile's release could be obtained from [[Pretoria]] that Thursday night. The ''[[Pretoria News]]'', however, did cover further reports confirming her release.
