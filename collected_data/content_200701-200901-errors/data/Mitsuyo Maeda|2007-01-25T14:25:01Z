'''Mitsuyo Maeda''' was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[judoka]], and prize-fighter often referred to as Count Combat (or Conde Koma in [[Brazil]], although he actually earned the nickname in [[Spain]] by [[1908]]).

==Biography==
Maeda was the teacher of the Gracie brothers and build the foundation for [[Gracie Jiu-Jitsu]] (now universally known as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]]). He entered the [[Kodokan]] during what was called the "Newaza revolution", where [[Judo]] became much more heavily ground-oriented due to the recent co-opting of the ground-centric '''Fusen Ryu Jujutsu''' masters into the Kodokan (following successive matches over the Kodokan at their hands).

==World Travels and Expulsion from the Kodokan{{fact}}== 

During the Meiji period, Maeda left [[Japan]] and travelled the globe. He entered in various challenge matches, intent upon serving as an ambassador of Kodokan judo to the world. He performed in open fights, with fighters from different styles in nearly every country he visited. It was as a result of these constant challenge matches that Maeda began to adjust his judo towards the end of greater efficiency against different styles of fighting. It should also be noted that in his travels, Maeda competed and trained extensively in the Western [[martial art]] of [[catch wrestling]], where it has been said that he learned to perfect the art of submitting his opponent from his back (due to the preference wrestlers generally held for the top position). 

However, ironically enough, as a member of the [[Kodokan]] (the [[Judo]] organization) Maeda was in fact barred from competing either in non-Kodokan events or events with a set of rules other than the Kodokans. For his breach, he was expelled from the school. In later years, his name was removed from the Kodokan registry.{{fact}}

==Theory of Combat==

Based on his travels competing and training alongside catch-wrestlers, boxers, [[savate]] practitioners and the other various fighters his travels brought him into contact with, he developed a theory that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases. In Maeda's mind, it was a smart fighter's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat that best suited his own strengths. Because Maeda's strength lay primarily in [[grappling]], he put much effort towards finding means to efficiently close the distance between himself and fighters specialized in striking.

==His Influence on the creation of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu==

Maeda immigrated to [[Belém]], Brazil in the 1910s, where a local influential businessman named Gastão Gracie helped him get established. In return for his aid, Maeda shared his knowledge of martial arts &mdash; which he referred to as jujutsu &mdash; with Gastão's son Carlos, who then passed it on to his brothers, including [[Hélio Gracie]]. Together, the brothers would found the system of grappling known as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].

Being small and lacking in physical strength, Helio Gracie was forced to improvise heavily upon Maeda's teachings. Ultimately, this would give rise to what Helio's son, [[Rorion Gracie]], trademarked as [[Gracie Jiu Jitsu]]. However, Carlos and his son, [[Carlson Gracie]] both referred often to Maeda's teachings both on the phases of combat and closing the distance in order to make use of grappling, such that it has become an integral part of their own style of [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].

It is not clearly known why Maeda chose to call his style of judo, [[Jujutsu]]. One accepted theory states that Judo wasn't so popular at those times and the ancient, general and established term for defining Japanese martial-art schools was Jujutsu (in Brazil it adopted the slightly different spelling Jiu-Jitsu). Judo itself was considered a school of Jujutsu (Kano school, or Kano Ryu), as attests the famous Jujutsu contest between the greatest Kodokan judoka and jujutsu masters all around Japan, held in June 11, 1886 at the Shiba Park's Yayoi shrine. Being just another school of Jujustu, Judo and Jujustu were considered interchangeable terms in the past.

==Legacy==

By sowing the seeds for Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Maeda can be arguably called one of the most influential judoka of modern times. His accomplishments across the globe as a judoka, catch wrestler and prize-fighter mark him as one of the early 20th century's most successful mixed martial artists. Furthermore, as a finalist in the world catch-wrestling champions who was reportedly unbeaten in judo bouts, he achieved what must be regarded as a phenomenal balance of success in those two sports. Whether or not another athlete has attained equal or greater accolades in both judo and wrestling is up for debate. Certainly, if such athletes exist, they are few in number.
