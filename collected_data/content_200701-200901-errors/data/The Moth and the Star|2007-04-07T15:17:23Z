"'''The Moth and the Star'''" is a [[fable]] by [[James Thurber]]. A young moth aspired to fly up to a star, and kept trying to reach that impossible goal. The other moths laughed at him. They told him he should have a realistic goal, such as flying to a candle. Indeed, they all flew to candles and were burnt to ashes. The dreamy, unrealistic young moth kept focused on flying to a star. He lived a long and happy life.
