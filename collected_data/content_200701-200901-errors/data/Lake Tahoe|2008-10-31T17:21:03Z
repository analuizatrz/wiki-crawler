'''Lake Tahoe''' is a large [[Fresh water|freshwater]] [[lake]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains of the [[United States]].  It is located along the border between [[California]] and [[Nevada]], west of [[Carson City, Nevada]]. Lake Tahoe is the largest [[alpine lake]] in [[North America]].<ref name=ltva2>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluelaketahoe.com/page.php?p=amaz&l=1 |title=Amazing Lake Tahoe |accessdate=2008-10-26 |work= |publisher=[[Lake Tahoe Visitors Authority]] |date= }}</ref> Its depth is {{convert|1645|ft|m|abbr=on}} making it America's second-deepest.<ref name=usgs20080103>{{cite web |url= http://tahoe.usgs.gov/facts.html |title= Facts About Lake Tahoe |accessdate=2008-10-26 |work= |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |date=2008-01-03 }}</ref> 

The lake was formed about 2 million years ago and is a part of the [[Lake Tahoe Basin]] with the modern Lake being shaped during the [[Ice Age]]s.  The lake is known for the clarity of its water and the panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://keeptahoeblue.org/facts/water.php |title=Water Quality |accessdate=2008-10-26 |work= |publisher=[[The League To Save Lake Tahoe]] |date= }}</ref>  The area surrounding the lake is also referred to as '''Lake Tahoe''', or simply '''Tahoe'''.

Lake Tahoe is a major tourist attraction for both California and Nevada.  It is home to a number of [[ski resorts]], summer outdoor recreation, and [[tourist attraction]]s.  Snow and skiing are a significant part of the area's economy and reputation.<ref name="porterstahoe">{{cite web |url=http://www.porterstahoe.com/lake-tahoe-resorts.asp |title=Lake Tahoe Resorts Winter sports |accessdate=2008-10-26 |work= |publisher=porterstahoe.com |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

==Natural history==
===Geology===
[[Image:LakeTahoeFromSpace.JPG|right|thumb|Lake Tahoe from space (north is to the right)]]
The '''Lake Tahoe Basin'''<!-- redirect target --> was formed by a geologic block (normal) [[Geologic fault|faulting]] about 2 million years ago. A geologic block fault is a fracture in the earth's crust causing blocks of land to move up or down. Uplifted blocks created the [[Carson Range]] on the east and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] on the west. Down-dropped blocks (a [[graben]]) created the Lake Tahoe Basin in between.<ref name="Tahoe Facts"/>

More technically, Lake Tahoe is the youngest of several extensional basins of the [[Walker Lane Deformation Belt]] that accommodates nearly 12 mm/yr of [[dextral shear]] between the [[Sierra Nevada Microplate]] and [[North American Plate|North America]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Oldow|first=J.S.|coauthors=C.L.V.

Some of the highest peaks of the Lake Tahoe Basin that formed during process of Lake Tahoe creation are [[Freel Peak]] at 10,891 ft (3,320 m), [[Monument Peak (Sierra Nevada)|Monument Peak]] at 10,067 ft (3,068 m) (the present [[Heavenly Ski Resort]]), [[Pyramid Peak (California)|Pyramid Peak]] at 9,983 ft (3,043 m) (in the [[Desolation Wilderness]]), and [[Mount Tallac]] at 9,735 ft (2,967 m).

Eruptions from the extinct [[volcano]] [[Mount Pluto, California|Mount Pluto]] formed a [[dam]] on the north side. Melting snow filled the southern and lowest part of the basin to form the ancestral Lake Tahoe. Rain and runoff added additional water.<ref> [http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/ltbmu/faqs/ "Frequently Asked Questions about Lake Tahoe and the Basin" Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture] accessed 20 June 2007</ref>

Modern Lake Tahoe was shaped and landscaped by scouring [[glacier]]s during the [[Ice Age]]s, which began a million or more years ago. Lake Tahoe is fed from 63 tributaries with the [[Truckee River]] as the only outlet.<ref name=ltva2/> The Truckee flows northeast through [[Reno, Nevada]] and into [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], Nevada which has no outlet.

Soils of the basin come primarily from [[andesitic]] volcanic rocks and [[granodiorite]], with minor areas of [[metamorphic rock]]. Some of the valley bottoms and lower hill slopes are mantled with glacial [[moraine]]s, or glacial outwash material derived from the parent rock. Cryopsamments, Cryumbrepts, rockland, rock outcrops and rubble and stony [[colluvium]] account for over 70% of the land area in the basin (see USA soil taxonomy). The basin soils (in the < 2 mm fraction) are generally 65-85% sand (0.05–2.0 mm).

Given the great depth of Lake Tahoe, and the locations of the normal faults within the deepest portions of the lake, modeling suggests that earthquakes on these faults can trigger [[tsunami]]s. Wave heights of these tsunamis are predicted to be on the order of {{convert|10|to|33|ft|0|abbr=on}}) in height, capable of traversing the lake in just a few minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ichinose |first=G.A.|coauthors=Anderson, J.G.; Satake, K.; Schweickert, R.A.; Lahren, M.M.|title=The potential hazard from tsunami and seiche waves generated by large earthquakes within Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada|year=2000|month=April|journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=27 |number=8 |pages=1203–1206 |doi=10.1029/1999GL011119}}</ref>  A massive collapse of the western edge of the basin that formed McKinney Bay around 50,000 years ago is thought to have generated tsunami/[[seiche|seiche wave]] with height approaching {{convert|330|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Gardner|first=J.V.|title=The Lake Tahoe debris avalanche|conference=Geological Society of Australia|booktitle=15th Annual Geological Conference |year=2000|month=July}}</ref>

While Lake Tahoe is a natural lake, it is also used for water storage by the [[Truckee-Carson Irrigation District]] (TCID). The lake level is controlled by a dam at the lake's only outlet, the [[Truckee River]], at Tahoe City. The 6 foot (2 m) high dam can increase the lake's capacity by {{convert|732000|acre.ft|km3|abbr=on}}.

===Climate===
[[Image:Fallen Leaf Lake and Lake Tahoe South Shore.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fallen Leaf Lake, California|Fallen Leaf Lake]] and Lake Tahoe in background from Angora Ridge Rd. to the [[Angora Lakes]] Resort]]
Mean annual precipitation ranges from over {{convert|55|in|abbr=on}} in watersheds on the west side of the basin to about 26 inches (660 mm) near the lake on the east side of the basin. Most of the precipitation falls as snow between November and April, although rainstorms combined with rapid snow melt account for the largest floods. There is a pronounced annual runoff of snowmelt in late spring and early summer, the timing of which varies from year to year. In some years, summertime [[monsoon]] storms from the Great Basin bring intense rainfall, especially to high elevations on the east side of the basin.

August is normally the warmest month at the [[Tahoe Valley Airport]] (elevation {{convert|6254|ft|m|abbr=on}}) with an average maximum of 78.7 °F (29.5 °C) and an average minimum of 39.8 °F (4.3 °C).  January is the coolest month with an average maximum of 41.0 °F (5.0 °C) and an average minimum of 15.1 °F (-9.4 °C).  The all-time maximum of 99 °F (37.2 °C) was recorded on July 22, 1988.  The all-time minimum of -29 °F (-33.9 °C) was recorded on December 9, 1972, and February 7, 1989.  Temperatures exceed 90 °F (32.2 °C) on an average of 2.0 days annually.  Minimum temperatures of 32 °F (0 °C) or lower occur on an average of 231.8 days annually, and minimum temperatures of 0 °F (-17.8 °C) or lower occur on an average of 7.6 days annually.  Freezing temperatures have occurred every month of the year.<ref>{{cite web

===Ecology===
Vegetation in the basin is dominated by a mixed conifer forest of [[Jeffrey pine]] (''Pinus jeffreyi''), [[lodgepole pine]] (''P. contorta''), [[white fir]] (''Abies concolor''), and [[red fir]] (''A. magnifica'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northstarattahoe.com/info/ski/media/tahoe_environment.asp |title= Trees Indigenous to Lake Tahoe |accessdate=2008-10-31 |work=[[
Northstar-at-Tahoe Resort]] |publisher=[[Booth Creek Ski Holdings|Booth Creek Ski Holdings, Inc.]] |date= }}</ref> The basin also contains significant areas of [[wet meadow]]s and [[riparian]] areas, dry [[meadow]]s, brush fields (with ''[[Arctostaphylos]]'' and ''[[Ceanothus]]'') and rock [[outcrop]] areas, especially at higher elevations. ''Ceanothus'' is capable of [[Nitrogen fixation|fixing nitrogen]], but [[mountain alder]] (''Alnus tenuifolia''), which grows along many of the basin’s streams, springs and seeps, fixes far greater quantities, and contributes measurably to nitrate-N concentrations in some small streams.

==Human history==
===Native people===
The area around Lake Tahoe was originally inhabited by the [[Washoe people|Washoe]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Lake Tahoe was the center and heart of Washoe Indian territory, including the upper valleys of the [[Walker River|Walker]], [[Carson River|Carson]], and Truckee Rivers. The English name for Lake Tahoe derives from the [[Washo language|Washo]] ''dá’aw'', "lake".<ref>Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 34</ref>

===Exploration===
Lt. [[John C. Frémont]] was the first non-indigenous person to see Lake Tahoe, during Fremont's second exploratory expedition on February 14. 1844.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trpa.org/default.aspx?tabindex=5&tabid=95 |title= Lake Tahoe Facts and Figures |accessdate=2008-10-26 |work= |publisher= [[Tahoe Regional Planning Association]] |date= }}</ref> [[John Calhoun Johnson]], Sierra explorer and founder of "Johnson's Cutoff" (now [[U.S. Route 50 (California)|U.S. Route 50]]), was the first white man to see Meeks Bay and from a peak above the lake he named [[Fallen Leaf Lake (California)|Fallen Leaf Lake]] after his Indian guide. His first job in the west was in the government service, carrying the mail on snowshoes from [[Placerville, California|Placerville]] to [[Nevada City]], during which time he named the lake "Lake Bigler" in honor of California’s governor [[John Bigler]]. In 1853 William Eddy, the surveyor general of California, identified Tahoe as Lake Bigler. In 1862 the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] first introduced the name Tahoe. Both names were used until well into the next century. The lake didn't receive its official and final designation as Lake Tahoe until 1945.

California and Nevada reached the compromise to partition Tahoe between the two when California became a state. With the state line east of the approximate centerline of the lake and then at 39 degrees north latitude, the state border runs southeasterly towards the [[Colorado River]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://water.nv.gov/WaterPlanning/truckee/truckee1.cfm#N_13_ |title= Truckee River Chronology |accessdate=2008-10-26 |work= |publisher= Nevada Department of Conservation & Natural Resources |date= }}</ref>

===Mining era===
[[Image:Boat on Lake Tahoe 200802.jpg|thumb|Boat at Lake Tahoe]]
Upon discovery of [[gold]] in the [[South Fork of the American River]] in 1848, thousands of gold seekers going west passed near the basin on their way to the gold fields. European civilization first made its mark in the Lake Tahoe basin with the 1858 discovery of the [[Comstock Lode]], a silver deposit just 15 miles (24 km) to the east in [[Virginia City, Nevada]]. From 1858 until about 1890, logging in the basin supplied large timbers to shore up the underground workings of the Comstock mines. The logging was so extensive that loggers cut down almost all of the native forest. In 1864, Tahoe City was founded as a resort community for Virginia City, the first recognition of the basin’s potential as a destination resort area.<ref name="usgs water">{{cite web|title=Stream and Ground-Water Monitoring Program, Lake Tahoe Basin, Nevada and California|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/FS-100-97/|publisher=United States Geological Survey and Tahoe Regional Planning Agency|date=1997-08-08}}</ref>

===Development===
Public appreciation of the Tahoe basin grew, and during the [[Sixty-second United States Congress|1912, 1913]], and [[Sixty-fifth United States Congress|1918 congressional session]]s, congressmen tried unsuccessfully to designate the basin as a [[United States National Park|national park]]. During the first half of the 20th century, development around the lake consisted of a few vacation homes. The post-[[World War II]] population and building boom, followed by construction of gambling casinos in the Nevada part of the basin during the mid-1950s, and completion of the interstate highway links for the [[1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Squaw Valley Olympics]], resulted in a dramatic increase in development within the basin. From 1960 to 1980, the permanent residential population increased from about 10,000 to greater than 50,000, and the summer population grew from about 10,000 to about 90,000.<ref name="usgs water"/> Since the 1980s, development has slowed due to controls on land use.

===Government and Politics===
Lake Tahoe lies within the borders of both California and Nevada, and as such is not governed by any single entity.  In California, Lake Tahoe is divided between [[Placer County, California|Placer County]] and [[El Dorado County, California|El Dorado County]].  In Nevada, Lake Tahoe is divided among [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], [[Douglas County, Nevada|Douglas County]] and [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] (an [[independent city]]).

The [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]] (TRPA) is a federal regulatory agency which is charged with environmental protection of the Lake Tahoe Basin through land-use regulation and planning.<ref>[http://www.trpa.org Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]</ref>

==Environmental issues==
===Water quality===
[[Image:Secret Beach - Lake Tahoe East Shore.jpg|left|thumb|Secret Beach on Lake Tahoe's Nevada side]]
In spite of land-use planning and export of treated [[sewage]] effluent from the basin, the lake is becoming increasingly [[eutrophic]] (having an excessive richness of nutrients), with primary productivity increasing by more than 5% annually, and clarity decreasing at an average rate of 0.25 meters per year. Fine [[sediment]], much of it resulting from land disturbance in the basin, accounts for about half of the loss in clarity. [[Charles Goldman]] from [[UC Davis]] was directly responsible for prompting Tahoe officials to pump all sewage effluent from the basin when Tahoe was being greatly developed in the 1950s. Goldman made local officials understand that even treated sewage would greatly affect the water quality of Lake Tahoe.<ref>{{cite web | title = Charles Goldman: Environmental Studies Recipient 1992-1993 | work = | publisher = UCDavis | date = | url = http://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/award/bios/goldman.html | accessdate = 2007-11-09 }}</ref>

Until the early 1980s, nutrient-limitation studies showed that primary productivity in the lake was nitrogen-limited. Now, after a half-century of accelerated nitrogen input (much of it from direct atmospheric deposition), the lake is phosphorus-limited. ''Because the volume of the lake is so large {{convert|156|km3|abbr=on}} and its hydraulic residence time so long (about 650 years), its eutrophication may be essentially irreversible.''<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.geocities.com/dtmcbride/tahoe/conservation.html |title= Tahoe Conservation |accessdate=2008-10-31 |work= |publisher= www.geocities.com |date=2007-02-15 }}</ref>

Lake Tahoe is a tributary watershed drainage element within the [[Truckee River Basin]], and its sole outlet is the Truckee River, which continues on to discharge to [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. Because of the sensitivity of Truckee River water quality (involving two protected species, the [[cui-ui]]<ref>{{IUCN2006|assessors=Gimenez Dixon|year=1996|id=4586|title=Chasmistes cujus|downloaded=10 May 2006}} Listed as Critically Endangered (CR B1+2b v2.3)</ref> [[sucker fish]] and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]]), this drainage basin has been studied extensively. The primary investigations were stimulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], who funded the development of the [[DSSAM]] model to [[hydrology transport model|analyze water quality]] below Lake Tahoe.

Lake Tahoe never freezes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skiheavenly.com/lake_tahoe/things_to_do/points_interest/q_a/ |title=Lake Tahoe Q&A |accessdate=2008-10-26 |work= |publisher= [[Heavenly Mountain Resort]] |date= }}</ref> Since 1970, it has mixed to a depth of at least {{convert|1300|ft|abbr=on}} a total of 6 or 7 times. Dissolved oxygen is relatively high from top to bottom.  Analysis of the temperature records in Lake Tahoe has shown that the lake warmed (between 1969 and 2002) at an average rate of 0.015 °C per year. The warming is caused primarily by increasing air temperatures, and secondarily by increasing downward long-wave radiation.  The warming trend is reducing the frequency of deep mixing in the lake, and may have important effects on water clarity and nutrient cycling.

===Ecosystem changes===
Since the 1960s, the Lake's food web and [[zooplankton]] populations have undergone major changes. In 1963&ndash;65, [[Mysidacea|opossum shrimp]] (''[[Mysis relicta]]'') were introduced to enhance the food supply for the introduced [[Kokanee salmon]] (''Onchorhynchus nerka''). The shrimp began feeding on the lake's [[cladoceran]]s (''[[Daphnia]]'' and ''[[Bosmina]]''), and their populations virtually disappeared by 1971. The shrimp provide a food resource for salmon and [[trout]], but also compete with juvenile fish for zooplankton. Since the 1970s, the cladoceran populations have somewhat recovered, but not to former levels.

In June 2007, the [[Angora Fire]] burned approximately {{convert|3100|acre|abbr=on}} throughout the [[South Lake Tahoe]] area. While the impact of ash on the lake's ecosystem is predicted to be minimal, the impact of potential future erosion is not yet known.<ref>"Raging Tahoe Fire's Roots: 150 Years of Mismanagement," Carl T. Hall, 'San Francisco Chronicle', June 26, 2007, A-1 </ref>

===Environmental protection===
Until recently, [[construction]] on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of wealthy real estate developers. Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]] is regulating construction along the shoreline (and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions). These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.

[[Image:EmeraldBay LakeTahoe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emerald Bay (Lake Tahoe)|Emerald Bay]], Lake Tahoe]]
The [[League to Save Lake Tahoe]] (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been the public interest watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake&mdash;with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay&mdash;was proposed in 1957, the League has repeatedly thwarted poorly designed development projects and environmentally unsound planning. Currently evaluating the "Pathways 2007" comprehensive plan being developed by TRPA, the League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake's resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keeptahoeblue.org/about/history.php |title=History of The League to Save Lake Tahoe |publisher=keeptahoeblue.org |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref>

Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.

== Tourist activities ==
Much of the area surrounding Lake Tahoe is devoted to the tourism industry and there are many restaurants, ski slopes and [[casino]]s catering to visitors. 

===Winter sports===
[[Image:Tahoe.JPG|right|thumb|Ski slopes overlooking Lake Tahoe]]

*[[Mount Rose Ski Resort]]: a medium sized ski area north-east of the Lake, on Slide Mountain

The majority of the ski resorts in the Lake Tahoe region are on the northern end of the lake, near [[Truckee, California]] and [[Reno, Nevada]]. [[Kirkwood Mountain Resort|Kirkwood]], [[Sierra-at-Tahoe]] and [[Heavenly Ski Resort|Heavenly]] are located on the southern side of the lake, approximately 80 miles (129 km) from Reno. It is common for visitors to ski amongst these 3 resorts when staying in Southern Lake Tahoe and not venture to the northern lake resorts ([[Squaw Valley Ski Resort|Squaw Valley]], [[Northstar at Tahoe]], [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort|Sugar Bowl]], etc.). 

Scattered throughout Tahoe are public and private [[sled]] parks. Some, such as Granlibakken are equipped with [[rope tow]]s to help sledders get up the hill.

Many ski areas around Tahoe also have [[snow tubing]], such as Squaw Valley. Snow tubing is popular among people who are interested in alternative sports. Throughout Tahoe, [[cross country skiing]], [[snowmobile]] riding, and [[snowshoe]]ing are also popular, thus there are many trails for them.

During late Spring to early Fall, the lake is popular for [[List of water sports|water sports]] and beach activities. The two cities most identified with the Lake Tahoe [[tourist]] area are [[South Lake Tahoe, California]] and the smaller Stateline; smaller centers on the northern shoreline include Tahoe City and [[Kings Beach, California|Kings Beach]].

Boating is a primary activity in Tahoe in the summer. There are lake front restaurants all over the lake, most equipped with [[pier|dock]]s and [[buoys]] (See the restaurants section). There are all sorts of boating events, such as sailboat racing, firework shows over the lake, guided cruises, and more. As an [[interstate]] [[waterway]], Lake Tahoe is subject to the [[United States Coast Guard]].  Lake Tahoe is home to [[Coast Guard Station Lake Tahoe]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Joanna |last= Hartman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Tahoe Coast Guard changes command |url=http://www.tahoe.com/article/SS/20070805/NEWS/70805008/0/COMMUNITY06 |work=tahoe.com |publisher= [[Sierra Sun]] |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26 }}</ref>

[[SCUBA diving]] is popular at Lake Tahoe, with some dive sites offering dramatic drop-offs or wall dives.  Diving at Lake Tahoe is considered advanced due to the increased risk of [[decompression sickness]] (DCS) while diving at such a high altitude.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tdconline.com/training/specialty/altitude.html |title=Altitude Diving |accessdate=2008-10-26 |work= |publisher= |date= }}</ref>

===Hiking and bicycling===
There are hundreds of hiking and mountain biking trails all around the lake. They range in length, difficulty, and popularity. One of the most famous of Tahoe's trails is the [[Tahoe Rim Trail]], a 165 mile (270 km) trail that circumnavigates the lake. Directly to the west of the lake is the [[Granite Chief Wilderness]], which provides great hiking and wilderness camping. Also, to the southwest is the very popular [[Desolation Wilderness]]. One of the most popular trailheads is the [[Eagle Lake Trailhead]].  There are also several paved off-road bicycle paths.

===Gambling===
[[Gambling]] is legal on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe.  [[Casino]]s, each a variety of [[slot machine]]s and [[table game]]s, are located on the South Shore in Stateline, and on the North Shore in Crystal Bay and Incline Village.

North Shore - Crystal Bay:
*[[Cal Neva Lodge & Casino]]
*[[Crystal Bay Club]]
*[[Jim Kelley's Tahoe Nugget]]
*[[Tahoe Biltmore Lodge & Casino]]

North Shore - Incline Village:
*[[Hyatt|Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa & Casino]]

South Shore - Stateline:
*[[Bill's Casino Lake Tahoe]]
*[[Harrah's Lake Tahoe]] - now owned by Harvey's
*[[Harveys Lake Tahoe|Harvey's Lake Tahoe Casino and Resort]]
*[[Lake Tahoe Horizon Casino|Horizon Casino Resort]]
*[[Lakeside Inn (Lake Tahoe)|Lakeside Inn]]
*[[MontBleu Resort Casino & Spa]]

==Transportation==
Lake Tahoe is accessible via [[Reno-Tahoe International Airport]] or [[Sacramento International Airport]]. General aviation access is available via the [[Lake Tahoe Airport]] in [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]].

The nearest passenger train service is the [[Truckee (Amtrak station)|Amtrak station in Truckee]].  

===Highways===
Visitors can reach Lake Tahoe under ideal conditions within 2 hours from the [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] area, 1 hour from [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] or 30 minutes from [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]]. In winter months, chains or snow tires are often necessary to reach Tahoe from any direction.  Traffic can be heavy on weekends due to tourists if not also from weather.

The primary routes to Lake Tahoe are on [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] via [[Truckee, California|Truckee]], [[U.S. Route 50 in California|US Highway 50]] via [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]] and [[Nevada State Route 431|Nevada Highway 431]] via [[Incline Village, Nevada|Incline Village]].  All of the highways accessing and encircling Lake Tahoe are paved 2-lane mountain roads.  US 50 traverses part of the eastern shore of the lake.

[[California State Route 89|California Highway 89]] follows the western shore of the lake through the picturesque wilderness and connects camping, fishing and hiking locations such as those at [[Emerald Bay State Park]], [[D. L. Bliss State Park|DL Bliss State Park]] and [[Camp Richardson, California|Camp Richardson]]. Farther along are communities such as [[Meeks Bay, California|Meeks Bay]] and Tahoe City. Finally, the highway turns away from the lake and heads northwest toward [[Truckee, California|Truckee]].

[[California State Route 28|California Highway 28]] completes the circuit from Tahoe City around the northern shore to communities such as [[Kings Beach, California|Kings Beach]], [[Crystal Bay, California|Crystal Bay]], and into [[Incline Village, Nevada]] where the road becomes [[Nevada State Route 28|Nevada Highway 28]]. Highway 28 returns along the eastern shore to US Highway 50 near [[Spooner Lake, Nevada|Spooner Lake]].

== In the media ==
The [[Ponderosa Ranch]] of the TV series [[Bonanza|''Bonanza'']] is located on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tvland.com/shows/bonanza/ |title= Bonanza |accessdate=2008-10-31 |work=[[TVLand]] |publisher=Viacom International Inc. |date= }}</ref>  The opening sequence of the TV series was filmed at the McFaul Creek Meadow, with [[Mount Tallac]] in the background.

In the motion picture ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', the [[Corleone family]] lived in a compound on the shores of the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe. In a famous scene from the final minutes of the film, [[Fredo Corleone]] is taken out onto the lake for a fishing trip, only to be executed for treachery, on the orders of his brother [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] ([[Al Pacino]]), who watches from the shore. The house and grounds portrayed in the film are actually located on the [[California]] side of Lake Tahoe: Fleur du Lac, the summer estate of [[Henry J. Kaiser]]. The only structures used in the movie that still remain are the complex of old native stone boathouses with their wrought iron gates. Although Fleur du Lac is private property and no one is allowed ashore there, the boathouses and multi-million dollar condominiums are easily viewed from the lake.

Most of the film ''[[Smoking Aces]]'' was filmed In South Lake Tahoe and Stateline. Many of the hotels and casinos are visible in the film with their older names.  The climactic scenes of the 1987 [[Charles Bronson]] film ''[[Assassination]]'' were filmed around and on Lake Tahoe.
