'''James Bond''', codename '''007''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[UK|British]] [[espionage|agent]]<ref>[http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/literary/casino_royale.php3 In Fleming's first novel, ''Casino Royale'', he refers to Bond as an agent.]</ref> created in [[1952]] by writer [[Ian Fleming]], featured in several [[novel]]s and [[Short story|short stories]]. After Fleming's death in 1964, subsequent James Bond novels were written by [[Kingsley Amis]] (as [[Robert Markham]]), [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]], [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], [[Raymond Benson]] and [[Charlie Higson]]. Moreover, [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] novelised two screenplays, while other writers have authored unofficial versions of the secret agent character. 
 
Initially famed through the novels, James Bond is best known from the [[EON Productions|Eon Productions]] [[film series]], twenty-one of which have been made as of 2007. The [[Bond 22|22nd EON-produced Bond adventure]] is currently in production.  In addition there are two independent productions and one Fleming-licenced [[United States|American]] television adaptation of the first novel. The Eon Productions films are generally described as the "official" films and, although its origin is unclear, this term is used throughout this article. [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. "Cubby" Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] co-produced the official films until [[1975]], when Broccoli remained the sole producer until his death in 1996. Since 1995, Broccoli's daughter [[Barbara Broccoli|Barbara]] and stepson [[Michael G. Wilson]] have co-produced them.

From 1962 through 2006, six actors have portrayed James Bond in "official" films:
<!---Please do not add Barry Nelson or David Niven to this list as they were not in official Bond films-->
*Sir [[Sean Connery]] (1962–1967; 1971)<!---Never Say Never was not an official Bond film; please do NOT add 1983 (it's noted in the paragraph following). The 2005 "From Russia with Love" video game is not considered a movie, either.-->
*[[George Lazenby]] (1969)
*Sir [[Roger Moore]] (1973&ndash;1985)
*[[Timothy Dalton]] (1987&ndash;1989)
*[[Pierce Brosnan]] (1995&ndash;2002)
*[[Daniel Craig]]   (2006&ndash;present)

The "unofficial" (that is non-Eon) versions were subject to separate licensing from Fleming. In the first version, [[Barry Nelson]] straight-forwardly portrayed James Bond in an [[Americanization|Americanised]] 1954 television episode adaptation of ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. In the second unofficial version, [[David Niven]] was James Bond in the Columbia Pictures spy [[spoof]] ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', in 1967. Moreover, Sean Connery reprised James Bond in the non-Eon film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983), an update of his own film, the fourth in the series, ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' of 1965.

Notably it is the first Bond film to be released in China.

Broccoli's and Saltzman's [[Family business|family company]], [[Danjaq|Danjaq, LLC]] has held ownership of the James Bond film series (through Eon), and maintained co-ownership with [[United Artists]] Corporation since the mid-1970s, when Saltzman sold his share of Danjaq to United Artists. As of 2007, [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/United Artists]] co-distribute the franchise.

In addition to the novels and films, James Bond is a prominent character in many [[James Bond games|computer and video games]], [[James Bond comic strips|comic strips]] and [[James Bond comic books|comic books]], and has been subjected to many [[James Bond parodies|parodies]].

==Ian Fleming's creation and inspiration==
{{main|James Bond (character)|Inspirations for James Bond}}

[[Image:007.svg|thumb|300px|The James Bond 007 gun logo]]

Commander James Bond, [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve|RNVR]] is an agent of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS) (more commonly, [[MI6]]). He was created in February 1952, by British journalist [[Ian Fleming]] while on holiday at his [[Jamaica]]n estate, Goldeneye. The hero, 'James Bond', was named after an [[United States|American]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|ornithologist]], a [[Caribbean]] bird expert and author of the definitive field guide book ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''. Fleming, a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]], had a copy of Bond's [[field guide]] at Goldeneye. Of the name, Fleming once said in a Readers Digest interview "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers' . Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure &ndash; an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department."<ref>{{cite book | last = Chancellor | first = Henry | year = 2005 | title = James Bond: The Man and His World | publisher = John Murray | id = ISBN 0-7195-6815-3}}</ref> 

Nevertheless, news sources speculated about real [[espionage|spies]] or other [[covert operations|covert agents]] after whom James Bond might have been named. Although they are similar to Bond, Fleming confirmed none as the source figure, nor did [[Ian Fleming Publications]] nor any of Fleming's biographers, such as [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]] or Andrew Lycett. 

It has also been suggested{{Fact|date=March 2007}} that the name 'James Bond' originated in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], when [[Naval Intelligence Division|British Naval Intelligence]] Commander Ian Fleming was invited by Sir [[William Stephenson]] (codename 'Intrepid'), to participate in the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] subversive warfare training Syllabus at [[Camp X|STS-103]]. Fleming had a private residence in [[Avenue Road]],  [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], because the training camp barracks was full. On Avenue Road, there was the [[St. James-Bond Church (Toronto)]], its address was 1066 Avenue Road, and the military building address  was 1107 Avenue Road (Double ones 0 and 7, thus number 007). The building does not exist, but in its place is [[Marshall McLuhan]] Catholic [[High school|Secondary School]] — erected by Bondfield Construction in 2001. 

James Bond's parents are Andrew Bond, a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] and Monique Delacroix, from Canton de [[Vaud]], Switzerland; their nationalities were established in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service''. 
Fleming emphasised Bond's Scottish heritage in admiration of Sean Connery's cinematic portrayal, whereas Bond's mother is named after a Swiss fiancée of Fleming's; a planned, but unwritten, novel would have portrayed Bond's mother as a Scot. Ian Fleming was a member of a prominent Scottish banking family.<ref>http://salon.com/books/feature/2006/11/25/fleming/</ref> In his fictional biography of secret agent 007, John Pearson gave Bond's birthdate as 11 November ([[Armistice Day]]) 1920; however, there is no evidence of it in Fleming's novels. Fleming was inspired by the playboy and real secret agent [[Tricycle (spy)|Dušan Popov]], a Serb [[double agent]] for the British and the Germans. Bond's family motto is Orbis non sufficit (The world is not enough).<ref>[http://www.themanspage.org/bond.shtml Biography of the Literary James Bond]</ref>

After completing the manuscript for ''Casino Royale'', Fleming allowed his friend, the poet [[William Plomer]] (later his editor), to read it, who liked it and submitted it to [[Jonathan Cape]], who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother [[Peter Fleming|Peter]], an established [[Travel literature|travel writer]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

[[Image:HoagyCarmichael.jpg|thumb|Photo of the young Hoagy Carmichael]]
Most researchers agree that the James Bond is a romanticised version of Ian Fleming, himself a jet-setting [[womanizer|womaniser]]. Both Fleming and Bond attended the same schools, preferred the same foods ([[scrambled eggs]], [[coffee]]), maintained the same habits (drinking, smoking, wearing short-sleeve shirts), shared the same notions of the perfect woman (in terms of looks and style), and had similar naval career paths (both rising to the rank of naval [[Commander]]). They also shared similar height, hairstyle and [[Eye color|eye colour]]. Bond's suave and sophisticated persona is based on that of a young [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. In ''Casino Royale'', the [[anti-heroine]] [[Vesper Lynd]] remarks, "[Bond] reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless". 

Fleming did admit to being partly inspired by his service in the [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Naval Intelligence Division]] of the [[Admiralty]], most notably an incident depicted in ''Casino Royale'', when Fleming and [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence Director]] [[John Henry Godfrey|Admiral Godfrey]] went on a mission to [[Lisbon]] en route to the United States during [[World War II]]. At the [[Estoril Casino]] (which harboured spies of warring regimes due to [[Portugal]]'s neutrality), Fleming was 'cleaned out' by a "chief [[Germany|German]] agent" in a game of [[Baccarat#Baccarat Chemin de Fer|Chemin de Fer]]. Admiral Godfrey's account differs in that Fleming played Portuguese businessmen, whom Ian fantasised as German agents he defeated at cards. Moreover, references to 'Red Indians' in Casino Royale, (four times, twice in the final page) are to his own [[30th Assault Unit|30 Assault Unit]].

==Books==
{{main|James Bond (novels)}}
In February 1952, Ian Fleming began writing his first James Bond novel. At the time, Fleming was the foreign manager for Kemsley Newspapers, owners of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in London. Upon accepting the job, Fleming asked for two months yearly vacation in his contract; time spent writing in Jamaica. Between 1953 and his death in 1964, Fleming published twelve novels and one short-story collection (a second collection was published posthumously). Later, continuation novels were written by [[Kingsley Amis]] (as [[Robert Markham]]), [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], and [[Raymond Benson]], the last published in 2002. The [[Young Bond]] series of novels was begun in 2005, they are written by [[Charlie Higson]].

In the late 1950s, [[EON Productions|Eon Productions]] guaranteed the [[film]] adaptation rights for every 007 novel except for ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' (those rights were recovered in the 1990s<ref>[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=12092&si=128 Bond, from the beginning?]</ref>) So in 1962, the first adaptation was made in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', that starred [[Sean Connery]] as 007.  Connery starred in 5 more films, and after his initial portrayal, he was followed by [[George Lazenby]] (1 film), [[Roger Moore]] (7 films), [[Timothy Dalton]] (2 films), [[Pierce Brosnan]] (4 films) and [[Daniel Craig]] (currently 1 film).  There have been currently 21 films, the [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|latest one]] with a [[reboot]] in the series. The [[Bond 22|22nd film]] is currently in production.  

The twenty-one Bond films have grossed over $4 billion worldwide, being the second most successful film series ever (behind ''[[Star Wars]]'').

===Non-Eon Films, Radio and Television Programmes===
In 1954, [[CBS]] paid Ian Fleming for the rights to adapt ''Casino Royale'' into a one hour [[television]] adventure as part of their ''[[Climax! (television)|Climax!]]'' series. However, Barry Nelson played a CIA agent named Jimmy Bond, and Clarence Lieter was a British agent. ''Casino Royale'' was later made into a [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 film spoof]]. A legal issue made [[Kevin McClory]] make a remake of ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', returning [[Sean Connery]] as 007 in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. MGM bought the name "James Bond" so future non-Eon productions are very unlikely.

==Dealing with the changing actor==
{{main|James Bond (character)#Alternative biographies and theories}}

The Bond films rarely explicitly acknowledge the changes in cast members which have affected several of the recurring characters including [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Blofeld]], [[Felix Leiter]], [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[Miss Moneypenny]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. However, there are a few instances of reference to this, including:
* In the early scenes of the 1967 ''Casino Royale'', David Niven's retired Bond berates M for giving his number and his name to a brash new agent; the description he gives fits Sean Connery's Bond.
* In ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', when Tracy leaves George Lazenby's Bond alone on the beach, he complains, "This never happened to the other fellow."  Similarly, a reference to Bond's return from holiday is included in the following film "Diamonds Are Forever," which featured Sean Connery's return to the role.
* In the non-EON film ''Never Say Never Again'', M states that he has taken over the post from another individual.
* In ''GoldenEye'', [[Valentin Zukovsky]] comments on how "the new M is a lady."  
* In ''The World Is Not Enough'' (1999) [[Major Boothroyd]]'s Q (played by [[Desmond Llewelyn]]) is preparing to retire, and introduces his successor, (jokingly referred to by Bond as "R"), played by [[John Cleese]]. Boothroyd has presumably retired by the time of ''Die Another Day'' (2002) as the character does not appear. In fact, Desmond Llewelyn had been killed in a car accident shortly after finishing the filming of The World is not Enough. Bond refers to Cleese's character first as Quartermaster, then as Q.  He was absent from "Casino Royale".

==James Bond's influence on movies and television==
{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}
{{main|James Bond parodies}}
James Bond has long been a household name and remains a huge influence within the spy genre. The ''[[Austin Powers]]'' series by writer and actor [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] and other parodies such as ''[[Johnny English]]'' (2003), ''[[OK Connery]]'', the "[[Our Man Flint|Flint]]" series starring [[James Coburn]] as Derek Flint, the "[[Matt Helm]]" movies starring [[Dean Martin]], and ''Casino Royale'' (1967) are testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture.

1960s TV imitations of James Bond such as ''[[I Spy]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', and ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' went on to become popular successes in their own right, the latter having enjoyed contributions by Fleming towards its creation: the show's lead character, "[[Napoleon Solo]]," was named after a character in Fleming's novel ''Goldfinger''; Fleming also suggested the character name April Dancer, which was later used in the spin-off series ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' A reunion [[television movie]], ''[[The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1983), is notable for featuring a cameo by George Lazenby as James Bond in tribute to Fleming (for legal reasons, the character was credited as "JB").

The animated series US Acres (which aired with the Garfield cartoons) featured a "secret agent" episode with many Bond references. For instance, the one-letter names used to apply to the high-ranking MI6 individuals were parodied.

The Nickelodeon animated series Doug had a secret agent character named Smash Adams, who was obviously inspired by Bond. The character's theme music even resembled Monty Norman's classic 007 theme.

Nickelodeon's sketch comedy series All That once did a James Bond parody called Jimmy Bond.

In ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', some time after the departure of the character ''[[Cathy Gale]]'' (played by actress [[Honor Blackman]]), the character of ''[[John Steed]]'' (played by [[Patrick Macnee]]) receives a Christmas card from her. He comments, "It's from Mrs Gale! I wonder what she's doing in Fort Knox?" &ndash; the intended destination for Honor Blackman's ''[[Pussy Galore (James Bond)|Pussy Galore]]'' in ''Goldfinger''. In further coincidence, this comment is made to ''[[Emma Peel]]'' &ndash; played by [[Diana Rigg]] who would later appear as ''[[Tracy Bond]]'' in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service''. Macnee himself, a friend of Roger Moore, would later appear as ''Sir Godfrey Tibbett'' in ''A View to a Kill''. Joanna Lumley (Purdey in the late Avengers series) can also be seen in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' in a little role with only one or two words.

A story line in ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' has Jethro ([[Max Baer, Jr.]]) forsaking his lifelong ambition to become a [[Neurosurgery|brain surgeon]] in favour of "double-nought spy." He outfits the Clampetts' truck with various Q-inspired gadgetry, none of which work according to plan.

In an apparent homage to the 'James Bond will return in...' credits, each of the season-ending episodes to date in the new (2005-present) series of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' has featured the ending credit, 'Doctor Who will return in...' followed by the title of the next episode (in each case, a [[Christmas special]]).{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Similarly, four episodes of the TV series ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' ([[For British Eyes Only]], [[Forget-Me-Now]], [[Notapusy]] and [[Mr. F]]) referenced the James Bond films. The spoofing of the Bond films is evident in the episode titles, vocal and instrumental music cues, and the gun barrel shot at the end of the episode accompanied by the subtitle "Michael Bluth will return in..."

[[George Lucas]] has said on various occasions that Sean Connery's portrayal of Bond was one of the primary inspirations for the [[Indiana Jones]] character, a reason Connery was chosen for the role of Indiana's father in the third film of that series.

In the episode "[[A Head in the Polls]]" of the animated television show [[Futurama]], the robot Bender asks for a martini from a bartender, who pours the ingredients directly into a hole in the top of Bender's head.  Bender then says, "Shaken, not stirred."

More of an imitation or homage (or possibly an unintentional parody),  at the start of the French film "Taxi 3", after a Bond-style opening stunt sequence that end when a spy (played by [[Sylvester Stallone]]) is taken away by helicopter, a Bond-style theme music / opening credits sequence is performed before the main story proceeds.

On the popular Internet series, ''[[Red vs Blue]]'', the character Donut is sent on a spy mission in the season 2 episode "Nut. Doonut.," and for around a quarter of the episode he makes references to James Bond and parodies some of the movie titles. The episode also has alternative titles based on Bond film titles.

==Music==
{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}
{{Main|James Bond music}}

"[[The James Bond Theme]]" was written by [[Monty Norman]] and was first orchestrated by the [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] Orchestra for 1962's ''Dr. No'', although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years. However, in 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from the British paper ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1229406.stm | title = Monty Norman sues for libel | work = Bond theme writer wins damages | accessdate = March 9 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Barry did go on to compose the [[Film score|scores]] for eleven Bond films in addition to his uncredited contribution to ''Dr. No'', and is credited with the creation of "[[The 007 Theme|007]]," used as an alternate Bond theme in several films, as well as the popular orchestrated theme "On Her Majesty's Secret Service." Both "The James Bond Theme" and "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" have been [[remix]]ed a number of times by popular artists, including [[Art of Noise]], [[Moby]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], and the [[Propellerheads]]. The British/Australian [[string quartet]] also named [[Bond (band)|bond]] (purposely in lower case) recorded their own version of the theme, entitled "Bond on Bond." 

Barry's legacy was followed by [[David Arnold]], in addition to other well-known composers and [[record producer]]s such as [[George Martin]], [[Bill Conti]], [[Michael Kamen]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and [[Eric Serra]]. Arnold is the series' current composer of choice, and recently completed the score for his fourth consecutive Bond film, ''Casino Royale''.

The Bond films are known for their theme songs heard during the title credits sung by well-known popular singers (which have included [[Tina Turner]], [[Wings (band)|Paul McCartney and Wings]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], among many others). [[Shirley Bassey]] performed three themes in total. ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' is the only Bond film with a solely instrumental theme, though [[Louis Armstrong]]'s ballad "[[We Have All the Time in the World]]," which serves as Bond and his wife Tracy's [[love song]] and whose title is Bond's last line in the film, is considered the unofficial theme. Perhaps one of the best known compositions is the title song to ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', which is also known as Nobody Does It Better. Written by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] with lyrics by [[Carole Bayer Sager]] and sung by [[Carly Simon]] it features both lyric and orchestral arrangements in the credit sequences of the film. The main theme for ''Dr. No'' is the "James Bond Theme," although the opening credits also include an untitled [[bongo]] interlude, and concludes with a vocal [[Calypso music|Calypso]]-flavoured rendition of "[[Three Blind Mice]]" entitled "Kingston Calypso" that sets the scene. ''From Russia with Love'' also opens with an instrumental version over the title credits (which then segues into the "James Bond Theme"), but Matt Monro's vocal version also appears twice in the film, including the [[closing credits]]; the Monro version is generally considered the film's main theme, even though it doesn't appear during the opening credits.  The only singer, to date, to appear within the titles is [[Sheena Easton]], who sang the theme for ''For Your Eyes Only''.  The only singer of a title song to appear within the film itself as a character, to date, is [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who appeared (uncredited) as a fencing instructor, Verity, as well as contributing the theme for ''Die Another Day''. [[Chris Cornell]] performs "[[You Know My Name]]" in ''Casino Royale''. He is the first male [[Singer|lead vocalist]] to perform a 007 song since [[a-ha]] in 1987 for "The Living Daylights." This is also the first Bond theme song since 1983's Octopussy to use a different title than the film.  Although many of the theme songs were successful hits, the only theme song to hit #1 in the U.S. was Duran Duran's "A View to a Kill" which hit the top of the Billboard HOT 100 chart in 1985.

In [[1998]], Barry's music from ''You Only Live Twice'' was adapted into the hit song ''[[Millennium (song)|Millennium]]'' by producer and composer [[Guy Chambers]] for British recording artist [[Robbie Williams]]. The music video features Williams parodying James Bond, and references other Bond films such as ''Thunderball'' and ''From Russia With Love''. It should also be noted that the video was filmed at Pinewood Studios, where most of the Bond films have been made.

==Video games==
{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}
{{main|James Bond (games)}}
[[Image:Everything or Nothing.jpg|thumb|''[[Everything or Nothing]]'' Pierce Brosnan as James Bond]]

In 1983, the first Bond video game, developed and published by [[Parker Brothers]], was released for the [[Atari 2600]], the [[Atari 5200]], the [[Atari 800]], the [[Commodore 64]], and the [[Colecovision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/3774/HTML/Games/JB_007.html|title=James Bond Games: James Bond 007|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on the films or using original storylines.

Bond video games, however, didn't reach their popular stride until 1997's ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'' by [[Rare (video game company)|Rare]] for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Subsequently, virtually every Bond video game has attempted to copy ''GoldenEye 007''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s accomplishment and features to varying degrees of success &ndash; even going so far as to have a game entitled ''[[GoldenEye: Rogue Agent]]'' that had little to do with either the video game ''GoldenEye'' or the film of the same name. Bond himself plays only a minor role in which he is "killed" in the beginning during a '[[virtual reality]]' mission, which served as a tutorial for the game.

Since acquiring the licence in 1999, [[Electronic Arts]] has released 8 games, 5 of which have original stories (i.e., not based on a film) including the popular ''[[Everything or Nothing]]'', which broke away from the [[first-person shooter]] trend that started with ''GoldenEye 007'' and went to a [[third-person shooter|third-person]] perspective. It also featured well known actors including [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Heidi Klum]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond, although several previous games have used Brosnan's likeness as Bond. In 2005, Electronic Arts released another game in the same vein as ''Everything or Nothing'', this time a video game adaptation of ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'', which allowed the player to play as Bond with the likeness of [[Sean Connery]]. This was the second game based on a Connery Bond film (the first was a 1980s [[text adventure]] adaptation of ''Goldfinger'') and the first to use the actor's likeness as agent 007. Connery himself recorded new voiceovers for the game, the first time the actor played Bond in 22 years.

In 2006 [[Activision]] secured the licence to make Bond-related games, currently shared with EA. The deal will become exclusive in September 2007.<ref>{{cite web | first=Ben | last=Fritz | title=Action traction: Bond, Superman games on the move | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117942524?categoryid=18&cs=1 | publisher=Variety | date=[[2006-05-03]]|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

==Comic strips and comic books==
{{main|James Bond comic strips|James Bond comic books}}

In 1957 the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a newspaper owned by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. After initial reluctance by Fleming who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed and the first strip ''[[Casino Royale#Comic strip adaptation|Casino Royale]]'' was published in 1958. Since then many illustrated adventures of James Bond have been published, including every Ian Fleming novel as well as [[Kingsley Amis|Kingsley Amis's]] ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', and most of Fleming's short stories. Later, the comic strip produced original stories, continuing until 1983.

[[Titan Books]] is presently reprinting these comic strips in an [[ongoing series]] of [[graphic novel]]-style collections; by the end of 2005 it had completed reprinting all Fleming-based adaptations as well as ''Colonel Sun'' and had moved on to reprinting original stories.

Several [[comic book]] adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years, as well as numerous original stories.

==Bond characters==
{{main|List of James Bond allies|List of James Bond villains|Bond girl}}

The James Bond series of novels and films have a plethora of allies and villains. Bond's superiors and other officers of the British Secret Service are generally known by letters, such as [[M (James Bond)|M]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. In the novels (but not in the films), Bond has had two secretaries, [[List of James Bond allies#Ponsonby, Loelia|Loelia Ponsonby]] and [[List of James Bond allies#Goodnight, Mary|Mary Goodnight]], who in the films typically have their roles and lines transferred to M's secretary, [[Miss Moneypenny]]. Occasionally Bond is assigned to work a case with his [[Friendship|good friend]], [[Felix Leiter]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. In the films, Leiter appeared regularly during the Connery era, only once during Moore's tenure, and in both Dalton films; however, he was only played by the same actor twice. Absent from the Brosnan era of films, Felix returned in Craig's first James Bond film ''Casino Royale'' in 2006.

Bond's women, particularly in the films, often have [[double entendre]] names, leading to coy jokes, for example, "[[Pussy Galore (James Bond)|Pussy Galore]]" in ''Goldfinger'' (a name invented by Fleming), "[[Plenty O'Toole]]" in ''Diamonds Are Forever'', and "[[Xenia Onatopp]]" (a [[villainess]] sexually excited by [[strangling]] men with her thighs) in ''GoldenEye''. 

Throughout both the novels and the films there have only been a handful of [[recurring character]]s. Some of the more memorable ones include [[List of James Bond allies#Tanner, Bill|Bill Tanner]], [[List of James Bond allies#Mathis, Rene|Rene Mathis]], [[Felix Leiter]], [[List of James Bond allies#Wade, Jack|Jack Wade]], [[Jaws (James Bond)#|Jaws]] and recently [[List of James Bond allies# Robinson, Charles|Charles Robinson]].

==Vehicles and gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets|List of James Bond firearms}}

[[Image:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Aston Martin DB5]] is probably the most famous and recognised Bond car]]

Exotic espionage equipment and vehicles are very popular elements of James Bond's literary and cinematic missions; these items often prove critically important to Bond removing obstacles to the success of his missions.

Fleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as ''From Russia with Love's'' booby-trapped [[attaché case]]; in ''Dr. No'', Bond's sole gadgets were a [[Geiger counter]] and a wristwatch with a luminous (and [[radioactive]]) face. The gadgets, however, assumed a higher, spectacular profile in the 1964 film ''Goldfinger''. The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to 007. In the opinion of many critics and fans, some Bond films have included too many outlandish gadgets and vehicles, such as 1979's [[science fiction]]–oriented ''Moonraker'' and 2002's ''Die Another Day'', in which Bond's [[Aston Martin]] could actually become [[Cloaking device|invisible]] thanks to a technology Q refers to as [[active camouflage|adaptive camouflage]]. Since ''Moonraker'', subsequent productions struggled with balancing gadget content against the story without depicting a technology-dependent man, to mixed results.

Bond's most famous car is the silver grey [[Aston Martin DB5]] seen in ''Goldfinger'', ''Thunderball'', ''GoldenEye'', ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' and ''Casino Royale''. The films have used a number of different Rover 214s for filming and publicity; one of them was sold in January 2006 at an auction in [[Arizona]] for $2,090,000 (USD) to an unnamed European collector. That specific car was originally sold for £5,000 in 1970.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4633986.stm | title = Aston Martin DB5 auction | work = James Bond car sold for over £1m | accessdate = February 8 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

In Fleming's books, Bond had a penchant for "battleship grey" [[Bentley]]s, while Gardner awarded the agent a modified [[Saab 900]] Turbo nicknamed the [[Licence Renewed#The Silver Beast|Silver Beast]] and later a [[Bentley Mulsanne]] Turbo.

In the James Bond films, Bond has been associated with several well-known watches  usually outfitted with high-tech features not found on the production models.  Perhaps the most famous of these is the Rolex Submariner, which appeared during the Sean Connery films.  Roger Moore's James Bond was fond of Seiko quartz watches. Pierce Brosnan's and Daniel Craig's James Bonds were both devotees of [[Omega Watches|Omegas]].  The selection of James Bond's watch has been a matter of both style and finance, as product placement agreements with the watch manufacturers have frequently been arranged.

Bond's weapon of choice in the beginning of ''Dr. No'' is a [[Beretta]] in 6.35mm Browning caliber, also called "Lilliput", later replaced by the German made [[Walther PPK]] in 7.65mm Browning. The PPK was used in every subsequent film and became his [[signature weapon]] until the ending of ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', when Bond required extra [[fire power]] and upgraded to the [[Walther P99]].  He used the pistol in ''The World Is Not Enough'' and ''Die Another Day'', and continued using it in ''Casino Royale''.

===Locations===
*Both ''Thunderball'' (1965) and ''Casino Royale'' (2006) were filmed at the casino resort on [[Paradise Island]] in the [[Bahamas]].
*''[[The Man With The Golden Gun]]'' (1974) was filmed in [[Bangkok]] and [[Phang Nga Bay]] in [[Thailand]]. The island in Pha Nga  which is featured in the movie is a popular tourist destination, and has been nicknamed "James Bond Island" due to this association.

===Other===
*German [[disco]] group [[Dschinghis Khan]] performed a song called "James Bond' on their 1982 album [[Helden, Schurken und der Dudelmoser]].<ref>[http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Dschinghis+Khan&titel=Helden%2C+Schurken+und+der+Dudelmoser&cat=a swisscharts.com]</ref>
*English [[rock (music)|rock]] group [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]] performed a song called "Miss Moneypenny" on their 1997 single "Nancy Boy"
*Swiss rock group [[Tunnelkid]] performed a song called "[[007]]“ on their 2006 album "Hang Me Now or Shoot Me Later"
*Swiss rock group [[Blotch]] performed a song called "Roger Moore" on their 2004 album "Passion, Love and Hurt"
*Desmond Dekker & the Aces had a UK Top 10 hit with the single "007" in 1967.
*On their second album "More Specials", released in 1980, The Specials closed side 1 with the track "Sock It To 'Em, J.B." Taking the song title at face value, the obvious musical JB inspiration is James Brown. However as the lyric name checks all the pre-1980 movies, inspiration for the track lies elsewhere.
*Kanye West and Jay-Z collaborate on [[Diamonds From Sierra Leone]], a song about the atrocities in Sierra Leone, but samples the theme from [[Diamonds Are Forever (soundtrack)|Diamonds Are Forever]].
*Two disco versions of the James Bond theme were released: one by the [[Biddu Orchestra]] called "James Bond Disco Theme" in 1978, and one by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] called "Bond '77" in 1977. The latter was composed for [[The Spy Who Loved Me]].
