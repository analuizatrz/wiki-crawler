"'''Fantasy'''" is a song co-written and co-produced by American singer [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Dave Hall (record producer)|Dave Hall]], and recorded for Carey's sixth album ''[[Daydream (album)|Daydream]]'' (1995). It is built around a sample of the [[Tom Tom Club]]'s single "[[Genius of Love]]" (1982), which was written by [[Tina Weymouth]], [[Chris Frantz]], [[Steven Stanley]] and [[Adrian Belew]]. It was released as the album's first [[single (music)|single]] in [[1995]] (see [[1995 in music]]), and is one of Carey's most popular songs. The urban remix of "Fantasy" features [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. The album version of the song was nominated for the 1996 [[Grammy Award]] for "[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]", losing to "No More 'I Love Yous'" by [[Annie Lennox]].

==Release and reception==
"Fantasy" became one of the biggest hits of Carey's career and was her ninth number-one single on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart. It was the first single by a female artist to debut at number one in the U.S., and only the second single to do so after "[[You Are Not Alone]]" by [[Michael Jackson]]. It spent eight weeks at the top of the chart, from [[September 24]] to [[November 18]] [[1995]], Carey's longest stay at the time alongside "[[Dreamlover]]" (1993). It replaced "[[Gangsta's Paradise (song)| Gangsta's Paradise]]" by [[Coolio]], and was replaced by [[Whitney Houston]]'s "[[Exhale (Shoop Shoop)]]". "Fantasy" spent twenty-three weeks in the top forty and was successful on other ''Billboard'' formats, including the [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[dance music|dance]] charts. Its strong sales led it to be certified double [[platinum single|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], Carey's first single to do so. It was ranked seventh on the Hot 100 year-end charts for 1995 and forty-ninth on the 1996 year-end charts.

The single was very successful outside the U.S., topping the charts in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] and producing another top five hit for Carey in the [[United Kingdom]]. It remained at the top of the Canadian Singles Chart for twelve weeks, a record it shared with six other singles until the release of "[[I'll Be Missing You]]" (1997) by [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]] featuring [[Faith Evans]].<ref>http://www.mariah-charts.com/chartdata/Canada.htm</ref> "Fantasy" also reached the top ten in most countries across [[Continental Europe]], and the top twenty on the [[Oricon|official singles chart]] in [[Japan]].

The single's [[music video|video]] was the first that Carey directed entirely on her own. She can be seen exploring an amusement park ([[Playland (New York)|Playland]], located in [[Rye, New York]]), on roller blades and riding on a [[roller coaster]], before joining a group of [[hip hop dance]]rs after nightfall. The video also contains a scene involving an [[overweight]] young girl who tries to emulate Carey and whose character reappears in the video for Carey's single "[[Shake It Off]]" (2005).

The song is featured in the film ''[[Rush Hour (film)|Rush Hour]]'' (1998), and [[Owen Pallett]] (a.k.a. Final Fantasy) has covered it live at various gigs.

==Remixes==
Carey worked with producer Sean Combs (Puff Daddy) to create the "[[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]" remix of Fantasy. The album version of "Fantasy" combines sensibilities of pop and [[hip hop music]], but the "Bad Boy" remix developed that concept by using guest raps from the late [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] (ODB). Carey had previously been famous for pop/[[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] ballads, though her own personal tastes leaned towards R&B and hip hop. Some of the song's pop elements were removed for the remix, while the [[bassline]] and "Genius of Love" sample were emphasised.  Part of the beat from "Fantasy" was also used in Mase's "That's the Way" as well in [[Akwid]]'s "Asi Es". It can be listened [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swIKY1meQXI here.]

It is perhaps most known for the participation of Ol' Dirty Bastard. The idea of an allegedly "clean" pop singer and a rapper working on the same song caused some controversy, further enforced with lines by ODB in the remix such as "Me and Mariah/go back like babies on pacifiahs". A video was created for the remix, compiled from footage shot for the original video and scenes involving ODB rapping. John Norris of [[MTV]] argued that it is "the single most important recording that she ever made".<ref>http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0504/30/pitn.01.html</ref>
 
Carey re-recorded vocals for club remixes of the song by [[David Morales]]. One of these remixes won the Winter Music Conference National Dance Award for "Dance Record of the Year".
