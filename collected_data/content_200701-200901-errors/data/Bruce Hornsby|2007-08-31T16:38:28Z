'''Bruce Randall Hornsby''' (born [[November 23]], [[1954]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[singer]], [[pianist]], [[accordion]] player, and [[songwriter]].  Known for the spontaneity and creativity of his live performances, Hornsby draws frequently from [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk]], [[motown]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[blues]], and [[jam band]] musical traditions with his songwriting and the seamless improvisations contained within. 

Hornsby's recordings have been recognized on a number of occasions with industry awards, including the Best New Artist [[Grammy]] for [[1986 in music|1986]] with '''Bruce Hornsby and the Range''', the Best Bluegrass Recording Grammy in [[1989 in music|1989]], and the Best Pop Instrumental Grammy in [[1993 in music|1993]].  

Hornsby has also achieved recognition for his solo albums and performances, his current live act '''Bruce Hornsby & the Noise Makers''', his bluegrass project with [[Ricky Skaggs]], his jazz act '''The Bruce Hornsby Trio''', and his wide-ranging appearances as a session- and guest-musician.  He also collaborated with the [[Grateful Dead]].

==Early years/background information==
Hornsby grew up listening to all types of music.<ref name="paulzollo">{{cite journal | last=Zollo | first=Paul | title=Bruce Hornsby: Straddling Worlds | journal=Performing Songwriter Magazine | issue=March/April 2001 | pages=28-33 | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/20010301_performing_songwriter_magazine_article.swf | format=[[SWF]] | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  He studied music at the [[University of Richmond]], as well as the highly regarded [[Berklee College of Music]] and the [[University of Miami]], from which he graduated in 1977.<ref name="officialbio">{{cite web | title=Biography: Bruce Hornsby | publisher= brucehornsby.com | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/bio.htm | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref><ref name="hamptonroadsmag">{{cite journal | last=Khandelwal | first=Michael Jon | title=Live from Williamsburg | journal=Hampton Roads Magazine | issue=March/April 2007 | pages=86-91 | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/20070301HRM.swf | format=[[SWF]]}}</ref>

In the spring of 1974, Hornsby's brother Bobby, who was a brother of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity at the [[University of Virginia]], formed a band, "Bobby Hi-Test and the Octane Kids" to play fraternity parties, featuring Bruce on [[Fender Rhodes]] and vocals.<ref name="bobbyhitest">{{cite web | title=Bobby High Test and the Octane Kids | url= http://www.realhornsby.com/octanekids.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  The band, which is listed in ''Skeleton Key: A Dictionary for Deadheads'', performed covers of [[Allman Brothers Band]], [[The Band]], and predominantly [[Grateful Dead]] songs.<ref name="bobbyhitest" />  Although Hornsby's collaboration with Bobby Hornsby would be relatively short-lived, at present, his brother Bobby's son, R. S., is a recurring guest-guitarist with Hornsby's band and periodically tours with his uncle.<ref name="officialbio" /><ref name="hamptonroadsmag" />

Following his graduation from the [[University of Miami]], in 1980, he and his brother (and songwriting partner) [[John Hornsby]] moved to [[Los Angeles]], where they spent three years writing for [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web | last=Ruhlmann | first=William | title=Bruce Hornsby: Biography | publisher=All Media Guide, LLC | url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:difqxqe5ldae~T1 | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  Hornsby also spent time in [[Los Angeles]] as a [[session musician]] and touring with [[Sheena Easton]]'s band<ref>{{cite web | last=Tortorici | first=Frank | title=Bruce Hornsby | publisher=MTV Networks | date=[[1998-11-23]] | url= http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/504164/19981121/hornsby_bruce.jhtml | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref> before moving back to his native southeastern [[Virginia]].<ref name="hamptonroadsmag" />

Outside the realm of music, Hornsby is an excellent [[basketball]] player and an avid fan of the sport.<ref name="vh1-birthday">{{cite web | title=You Say It's Your Birthday: Bruce Hornsby | publisher=MTV Networks | date=[[1997-11-21]] | url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1955/19971121/hornsby_bruce.jhtml | accessdate =2007-05-04}}</ref>  As such, he can frequently be seen at college [[basketball]] games around the state of [[Virginia]].<ref name="hamptonroadsmag" />

==Range years==

In 1984 he formed '''Bruce Hornsby and the Range''', who were signed to [[RCA Records]] in [[1985 in music|1985]].  Besides Hornsby, Range members were [[David Mansfield]] ([[guitar]], [[mandolin]], [[violin]]), George Marinelli (guitars and [[backing vocals]]), [[Joe Puerta]] ([[bass guitar]] and backing vocals), and [[John Molo]] ([[drums]]).

Hornsby's recording career started with the biggest hit he would ever have, entitled "[[The Way It Is]]".  It topped the American music charts in 1986.<ref name="againstthegrain">{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=John | title=Against the Grain: An Interview with Bruce Hornsby | journal=The Music Box | volume=7 | issue=11 | date=November 2000 | url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> With a propulsive yet contemplative piano riff and the refrain, ''That's just the way it is, some things will never change'', the song was catchy and described aspects of the [[American Civil Rights movement]] and institutional racism.<ref name="songfacts-thewayitis">{{cite web | title=Songfacts: "The Way It Is" by Bruce Hornsby | url= http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=5494 | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> The song also hit a nerve with the American public, reflecting dissatisfaction with economic decline in the early-to-mid 1980s.  Many U.S. factories were closing nationwide, workers were being forced into unemployment (virtually unheard of since the [[Great Depression]]), farms were being auctioned off, and [[Reaganomics]] initially bogged down in creating personal wealth.<ref name="songfacts-thewayitis" />  In years to come, the song would be sampled by at least six [[rapping|rap]] artists, including [[Tupac Shakur]], [[E-40]], and [[Ma$e|Mase]].<ref name="againstthegrain" />
  
With the success of the single worldwide, the album ''[[The Way It Is (Bruce Hornsby album)|The Way It Is]]'' went [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Bruce Hornsby | publisher=JamBase | url=http://www.jambase.com/search.asp?bandID=1186&display=bio| accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref> and produced another top five hit with "[[Mandolin Rain]]" (co-written, as many of Hornsby's early songs were, with [[John Hornsby]]).<ref name="againstthegrain" />  "Every Little Kiss" also did respectably well.<ref name="againstthegrain" />  Other tracks on the album helped establish what some labeled the "Virginia sound", a mixture of [[rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with an observational [[Southern United States|Southern]] feel.<ref name="cathalenaeburch">{{cite news | last=Burch | first=Cathalena E | title=Musician tells it 'the way it is' | work=Arizona Daily Star | date=[[2005-12-29]] | url= http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/20051229_interview_ADS.swf | format=[[SWF]] | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  Bruce Hornsby and the Range would go on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1986.

{{Bruce Hornsby timeline}}
Hornsby and the Range's second album, ''[[Scenes From The Southside]]'' (on which Peter Harris replaced Mansfield) was released in [[1988 in music|1988]].  It featured such hits as "Look Out Any Window" and "The Valley Road" which many critics noted due to their "more spacious" musical arrangements, allowing for "more expressive" [[piano]] solos from Hornsby.<ref name="vh1-birthday" /><ref name="allmusic-scenesfromthesouthside">{{cite web | last=Iyengar | first=Vic | title=Scenes From the Southside: Overview | publisher=All Media Guide, LLC | url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:difqxq85ldae | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> The song "[[Jacob's Ladder (Huey Lewis & The News song)|Jacob's Ladder]]" was featured as well, having originally been written by Hornsby for musician friend [[Huey Lewis]]; Lewis' version became a number one hit from his album ''[[Fore!]]''.<ref name="deadnet">{{cite web | title=Bruce Hornsby | publisher=DeadNet | date=May 1995 | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/19950501_dead_net.swf | format=[[SWF]] | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> ''Scenes'' was successful as an album, once again offering slices of "Americana" and "small-town nostalgia,"<ref name="allmusic-scenesfromthesouthside" /> but it would be the group's last album to perform so well in the singles market.<ref name="vh1-birthday" />
 
In 1988, Hornsby first appeared on stage with the [[Grateful Dead]], a recurring collaboration that would continue until the band's dissolution.<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend">{{cite web | last=Heisler | first=Brett I. | title=Grateful Family and Friend: Bruce Hornsby | publisher=philzone.com | date=[[2000-10-09]] | url=http://www.philzone.com/interviews/hornsby/ | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>  Hornsby went on to appear on stage frequently as a guest before becoming a regular fixture in the touring lineup for the Dead a few years later.  During the late 1980s and early 1990s Hornsby worked extensively as a producer and sideman, notably producing a comeback album for [[Leon Russell]], an idol of Hornsby's.<ref name="allmusic-bio" />  In 1989 Hornsby co-wrote and played piano on [[Don Henley|Don Henley's]] big hit "[[The End of the Innocence (song)|The End of the Innocence]]".  In [[1991 in music|1991]] Hornsby played piano on [[Bonnie Raitt|Bonnie Raitt's]] popular hit "[[I Can't Make You Love Me]]".  Hornsby would feature both of these songs in his own concerts.  He also appeared on albums by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Robbie Robertson]], [[Crosby Stills and Nash]], and [[Squeeze]] during this time period.<ref name="vh1-birthday" />

During this era, Hornsby slowly began to slip jazz and bluegrass elements into his music, first in live performance settings and later on studio work.<ref name="againstthegrain" />  In 1989, he first performed at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. He also reworked his hit "The Valley Road" with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], which scored a [[Grammy]].  

''[[A Night On The Town]]'' was released in [[1990 in music|1990]], on which he teamed up with jazz musicians [[Wayne Shorter]] and [[Charlie Haden]] as well as bluegrass pioneer [[Bela Fleck]].  A change in style became apparent as the album was much more rock- and [[guitar]]-driven, making use of [[Jerry Garcia]]'s guitar work on a number of tracks, perhaps most prominently on "Across the River".<ref name="allmusic-anightonthetown">{{cite web | last=Newsom | first=Jim | title=A Night on the Town: Overview | publisher=All Media Guide, LLC | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fifqxq85ldae | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>  In concert, Hornsby and the Range began to stretch out their songs, incorporating more and more "freewheeling musical exchanges."<ref name="againstthegrain" />  Critics received the album quite well, praising it for its production, its political relevance, and Hornsby's gestures toward expanding out of a strictly pop sound by incorporating jazz and bluegrass.<ref name="allmusic-anightonthetown" />  Ultimately, though, the core "rock band" sound of the Range limited Hornsby's aspirations, and after a final three-week tour in 1991, Hornsby disbanded the outfit to enter a new phase of his career.<ref name="againstthegrain" />  Drummer [[John Molo]] continued to perform regularly with Hornsby, although other members pursued separate musical endeavors.

==Hornsby & the Grateful Dead==

Bruce Hornsby played [[piano]] (and frequently [[accordion]]) nightly with the [[Grateful Dead]] from [[September]] 1990 through [[March 24]], [[1992 in music|1992]]. Hornsby played with the band following the death of [[Brent Mydland]] and preceding the acceptance of [[Vince Welnick]] as sole keyboardist.  

Hornsby's own music evolved significantly during this time period, although his primary performative project remained the Grateful Dead.  Critics have suggested that Dead's vibrant tradition of melding [[folk music]] and the [[blues]] with [[psychedelic rock]] in  "loose-knit expressions" and extended jamming "further pushed [Hornsby] outside the confines of mainstream pop."<ref name="againstthegrain" />  Critics have also commented upon the "close musical connection"<ref>{{cite web | last=Schwartz | first=Greg M. | title=Intersections of Musical Directions: An Interview with Keyboard Great Bruce Hornsby | publisher=PopMatters Media, Inc | date=[[2006-09-21]] | url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/hornsby-bruce-060921.shtml | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> formed between Hornsby and [[Jerry Garcia]], suggesting that Hornsby's particular style of jazz-fueled improvisation added to the band's repertoire<ref>{{cite journal | last=Silberman | first=Steve | title=Chills in the Hot Seat: An Interview with Bruce Hornsby, 1993 | journal=Dupree's Diamond News | issue=29 | date=[[1993-10-14]] | url=http://www.levity.com/digaland/hornsby93.html | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>, and helped to revitalize and refocus Jerry Garcia's guitar solos in the band's sound.<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend" />  Hornsby's friendship with Garcia would continue, both inside and outside the band, as the two would "challenge" each other to expand their musicianship through several other album and live collaborations.<ref name="paulzollo" />  Above all, Hornsby's musical versatility and ability to slip in and out of extended freeform jams won over longtime Grateful Dead fans.<ref name="johnwbarry">{{cite web | last=Barry | first=John W | title=Bruce Hornsby Live Set Puts New Spin On Old Tunes | date=[[2000-11-07]] | url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1224281/20001107/hornsby_bruce.jhtml | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>  

Hornsby originals "The Valley Road" and "Stander on the Mountain" appeared several times in the Dead's setlists.  Hornsby also co-performs the improvisation "Silver Apples of the Moon" for the Grateful Dead's ''[[Infrared Roses]]''. His relationship to the Grateful Dead would continue on a less regular basis until the Grateful Dead ended in [[1995 in music|1995]]; in all he made over a hundred concert appearances with them.  Beginning in the early 1990s, and continuing to the present, Hornsby's live shows have drawn [[Deadhead]]s; Hornsby reflects upon this phenomenon as follows:  "I've always liked the group of fans that we've drawn from the Grateful Dead time, because those fans are often adventurous music listeners."<ref name="officialbio" />  Hornsby has paid tribute to his time with the Dead by performing a number of their songs during his concerts and by various homages on studio and live albums.<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend" />

In [[1994 in music|1994]] the Grateful Dead were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] at the ninth annual induction dinner.  Bruce Hornsby was their presenter.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Grateful Dead | publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc | url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/the-grateful-dead | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}</ref>  To this day, Hornsby continues to work with Dead-related projects, such as [[Bob Weir]]'s [[Ratdog]], [[Mickey Hart]]'s solo projects, and in [[2005 in music|2005]] participated in a tribute concert to Jerry Garcia, "Comes a Time."

==Solo years==
===The solo records===

Hornsby would go on to release his first solo album, ''[[Harbor Lights (album)|Harbor Lights]]'', in [[1993 in music|1993]].  This record showcased Hornsby in a more jazz-oriented setting and featured an all-star lineup, including [[Pat Metheny]], [[Branford Marsalis]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Phil Collins]], and [[Bonnie Raitt]].  Unlike earlier albums, ''[[Harbor Lights (album)|Harbor Lights]]'' allowed more space for Hornsby's and guest-players' "extended instrumental" solos to "flow naturally" out of the songs.<ref name="allmusic-harborlights">{{cite web | last=Miller | first=Skyler | title=Harbor Lights: Overview | publisher=All Media Guide, LLC | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gvfqxq8gldke | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  The tone was set by the opening title track, which after 50 seconds of expansive solo piano lurches into an up-tempo jazz number, ending with [[Pat Metheny|Metheny]]'s guitar runs.  The album closes in a similar fashion with "Pastures of Plenty", this time with an extended guitar solo from Garcia intertwined with Hornsby's piano.  Hornsby also quotes the main musical phrase from the [[Grateful Dead]]'s "[[Dark Star (song)|Dark Star]]" as the jazz head to his song about tensions surrounding a biracial relationship, "Talk of the Town".<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend" />  The mid-tempo "Fields of Gray", written for Hornsby's recently-born twin boys, received some modest radio airplay.  ''[[Harbor Lights (album)|Harbor Lights]]'' was well-received by critics and fans, who praised it for its "cooler, jazzier sound" and its "affinity for sincere portraits of American life, love, and heartache."<ref name="allmusic-harborlights" />  Hornsby would also secure his third Grammy in 1993 for Best Pop Instrumental for "Barcelona Mona" (composed with [[Branford Marsalis]] for the [[Barcelona Olympics]]).

[[Image:HornsbyHotHouse.jpg|right|thumb|250px|'''''Hot House''''' (1995) cover art, featuring an imagined jam session with Charlie Parker and Bill Monroe]]  

In 1995, ''[[Hot House (album)|Hot House]]'' was released with its cover art, featuring an imagined jam session between [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] legend [[Bill Monroe]] and [[jazz]] legend [[Charlie Parker]], serving as an apt metaphor for the rich fusion of musical styles Hornsby was currently developing and expanding. This album would find Hornsby expanding upon the foray into jazz sound from ''[[Harbor Lights (album)|Harbor Lights]]'', this time reintroducing elements of bluegrass from ''[[A Night On The Town]]'' and his earlier collaborations.<ref>{{cite web | last=Miller | first=Skyler | title=Hot House: Overview | publisher=All Media Guide, LLC | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:f9fwxqthldae | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  Much like the socially-conscious lyrics of his earlier work, the underlying messages behind the catchy tunes are often very dark, such as on "Country Doctor", "Hot House Ball" and "White Wheeled Limousine", where story-telling lyrics build around spousal [[murder]], [[nuclear accidents|nuclear disaster]], and wedding-day [[adultery]], respectively.<ref name="deadnet" />  The album featured many of the same guests as on his previous record, such as [[Pat Metheny]] and [[Jimmy Haslip]].  [[Béla Fleck]] also collaborates again on banjo.  

As a testament to Hornsby's willingness to allow songs space to grow and evolve, it is worth noting that the song "White Wheeled Limousine" had debuted five years earlier as an encore to Branford Marsalis's opening act for the Grateful Dead's 12/31/90 New Year's Concert, (Marsalis and [[Rob Wasserman]] joined Hornsby in the performance).<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend" />  The ''Hot House'' version of "White Wheeled Limousine" pairs [[Pat Metheny]]'s guitar with Béla Fleck's banjo for a blisteringly intricate call-and-response alongside Hornsby's piano runs.<ref name="deadnet" />  ''Hot House'' also makes an homage to Hornsby's years with the Dead via his recasting of the chorus/bridge of the Dead's song "Estimated Prophet" as the newly-lyricized Hornsby tune "Tango King."<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend" />  The album also boasts a more prominent role for ''[[Harbor Lights (album)|Harbor Lights]]'' alum John D'earth on trumpet and introduces Bobby Read on woodwinds and J. V. Collier on bass.  Read and Collier continue to perform with Hornsby to this date.

| style="text-align: left;" | "To be creative, spontaneous in the moment and make music in the present tense, that's what we're all about live. I write the songs, we make the records and then the records become a departure point, the basic blueprint, the basic arrangement. I'm fairly restless creatively. I was never a very good Top 40 band guy because I never liked to play the same thing every time. Too often songwriters approach their songs like museum pieces. I don't subscribe to that. I think of my songs as living beings that evolve and change and grow through the years."<ref name="officialbio" />
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | — Bruce Hornsby
|}During this time period, "even his concerts conveyed a looser, more playful mood, and Hornsby began taking requests from the audience."<ref name="againstthegrain" />  Hornsby's concerts became "departure points" for his album compositions, which would be blended with and reworked into "lengthy spontaneous medleys".<ref name="officialbio" /><ref name="againstthegrain" />  Both in terms of audience requests and in terms of spontaneous on-stage decisions, Hornsby's performances became opportunities for him to challenge himself by trying to "find a way to seamlessly thread these seemingly disparate elements together."<ref name="againstthegrain" />

Hornsby next worked with several Grateful Dead reformation projects, including several Furthur Festivals and the ultimate formation of [[The Other Ones]], which resulted in the release a live album, ''[[The Strange Remain]]''.  Hornsby's [[piano]] and vocals factor heavily into the band's performance of classic Dead tunes "Jack Straw" and "Sugaree" (which features Hornsby on lead vocal, in Jerry Garcia's absence), and Hornsby-originals "White-Wheeled Limousine" and "Rainbow's Cadillac" receive reworkings in the hands of The Other Ones.<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend" /> 

[[Image:HornsbySpirit.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Hornsby's uncle's goofy pose set the tone for '''''Spirit Trail''''' (1998), Hornsby's first double-album effort]]

Three years after ''Hot House'', Hornsby released a [[double album]], ''[[Spirit Trail]]''. Featuring a decidedly goofy picture of his uncle on the cover, the collection blends instrumental tracks with the story-telling, [[Rock music|rock]], jazz, and other musical forms Hornsby had delved into over his career.  Over the two discs, Hornsby weaves a tapestry of varied textures, from the fervent spirituality then almost [[gospel]] dirge of "Preacher in the Ring, parts I & II," to the catchy chord progressions of "Sad Moon."<ref name="aribendersky">{{cite web| last=Bendersky | first=Ari | title=Bruce Hornsby Redefines Himself | publisher=Rolling Stone | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/brucehornsby/articles/story/5919218/bruce_hornsby_redefines_himself | date=[[1998-10-15]] | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref> Among other homages, the song "Sunflower Cat (Some Dour Cat) (Down With That)" samples and loops the main lick from the Grateful Dead song "China Cat Sunflower."<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend" />  In some of the songwriter's most poignant lyrics to date, ''Spirit Trail'' considers "very Southern" themes with "songs about race, religion, judgment and tolerance" and "struggles with these issues."<ref name="aribendersky" />

Throughout the sequence of ''[[Harbor Lights (album)|Harbor Lights]]'', ''Hot House'', and ''Spirit Trail'', Hornsby's piano playing steadily gained further complexity, taking on a more varied array of musical styles and incorporating more and more difficult techniques, as evidenced by his two-hand-independence on ''Spirit Trail'''s "King of the Hill."<ref name="aribendersky" />  During this same span of solo album years, Hornsby made several mini-tours playing solo piano gigs for the first time in his career.<ref name="deadnet" />  These shows allowed Hornsby limitless possibilities for seguing songs into other songs, often blurring lines between classical compositions, jazz standards, traditional bluegrass, [[folk music|folk]], and [[fiddle]] tunes, Grateful Dead songs, and, of course, reworkings of Hornsby originals.<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend" />  Hornsby reflected on these periods of intensive solo performances stating that these solo tours helped him "recommit [himself] to the study of piano" and "take [his] playing to a whole new level", explorations and improvisations that would not be possible in a band setting.<ref name="aribendersky" />

===Hornsby & the Noise Makers===

Hornsby's own touring band line up underwent extensive changes during the period from [[1998 in music|1998]] to [[2000 in music|2000]] as well, not the least of which was the apparent end of musical collaboration with long time drummer [[John Molo]], who then became former [[Grateful Dead]] bassist [[Phil Lesh]]'s regular drummer in his post-Dead band [[Phil Lesh & Friends]].<ref name="gratefulfamilyandfriend" />  A set of twenty consecutive shows performed by Hornsby and his band at Yoshi's jazz club in [[Oakland, CA]] would mark a particularly innovative period of evolution for his live shows; here Hornsby and his band were "able to explore songs in a completely spontaneous fashion".<ref name="musicbox-herecomethenoisemakers">{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=John | title=Bruce Hornsby: Here Come the Noisemakers | journal=The Music Box | volume=7 | issue=12 | date=December 2000 | url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-noise.html | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  As Hornsby experimented with a different sound, ushering in frequent collaborations with such musicians as [[Steve Kimock]] on guitar and Bobby Read on heavily effects-driven electronic woodwinds, his current band, dubbed '''Bruce Hornsby & the Noise Makers''', took shape.  In 2000, Hornsby chronicled this journey with a compilation live album entitled ''[[Here Come The Noise Makers]]'', and did extensive touring with his new band featuring John "J. T."

His next studio album of new material was not until [[2002 in music|2002]]: ''[[Big Swing Face]]''.  This album marked Hornsby's most experimental effort to date; ''Big Swing Face'', the only album on which Hornsby does not play any [[piano]], relies heavily on post-electronica beats, drum loops, Pro Tools editing, and dense [[synthesizer]] arrangements.<ref name="allmusic-bigswingface">{{cite web | last=Erlewine | first=Stephen Thomas | title=Big Swing Face: Overview | publisher=All Media Guide, LLC | url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:djftxqw0ldje | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  The album also boasts a "stream-of-consciousness wordplay" of lyrics that are in many ways more eccentric and humorous than previous work.<ref name="musicbox-bigswingface">{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=John | title=Bruce Hornsby: Big Swing Face | journal=The Music Box | volume=9 | issue=8 | date=August 2002 | url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-swing.html | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  The [[jazz fusion]] jam on "Cartoons & Candy" and the gesture towards Hornsby's [[jam band]] influence with [[Steve Kimock]]'s extended [[guitar solo]] on "The Chill" highlight some of the album's only familiar territory<ref name="musicbox-bigswingface" />, and Hornsby cites the opening track, "Sticks and Stones," as his partial homage to [[Radiohead]]'s "Everything in its right place."<ref name="intersectionsliner">{{cite book|title=Liner notes from ''Intersections'' Box Set| author = Hornsby, Bruce| date = 2006}}</ref>  ''Big Swing Face'' met mixed reviews ranging from "a new and improved Bruce Hornsby"<ref name="allmusic-halcyondays">{{cite web | last=Miller | first=Skyler | title=Halcyon Days: Overview | publisher=All Media Guide, LLC | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wjfpxqraldhe | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref> to feeling as if "someone else is singing" to the album being called one of the "strangest records of 2002."<ref name="allmusic-bigswingface" /> Album sales were not helped by poor promotion from RCA, perhaps prompting Hornsby's decision to leave the label.<ref name="intersectionsliner" />

In [[2004 in music|2004]], after 19 successful years on RCA Records, Hornsby returned to a more acoustic, piano-driven sound on his [[Columbia Records]] debut ''[[Halcyon Days (Bruce Hornsby album)|Halcyon Days]]'', which reviewers referred to as "pure Hornsby".<ref name="rollingstone-halcyondays">{{cite web | last=Wild | first=David | title=Bruce Hornsby: Halcyon Days | publisher=Rolling Stone | date = September 2, 2004 | url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/brucehornsby/albums/album/6415110/review/6416461/halcyon_days | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref> Guests included [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Elton John]], and [[Eric Clapton]].  The tracks "Gonna Be Some Changes Made,"  "Candy Mountain Run," "Dreamland," and "Circus On The Moon" would become quick concert staples, each showcasing the diversity of Hornsby's improvisations and the Noise Makers' live sound.  Notably, ''Halcyon Days'' also includes a suite of solo piano songs&mdash;"What The Hell Happened To Me," "Hooray For Tom," and "Heir Gordon"&mdash;which all have a "[[Randy Newman]] pastiche."<ref name="allmusic-halcyondays" />  Although the album was markedly less-risk-taking than ''[[Big Swing Face]]'', it would be well-received as a "winning balance of [Hornsby's] tuneful and adventurous sides."<ref name="rollingstone-halcyondays" />  Throughout tours following the album's release, both with the Noise Makers and in solo performances, Hornsby continued to demonstrate his desire to "grow" as a [[singer]] and [[performer]] and to expand the instrumental possibilities of the piano in various genres.<ref name="cathalenaeburch" />  During this time period, Hornsby also began to offer CD-sets/digital downloads of digitally-mastered soundboard recordings of live concerts via the ''Bruce Hornsby Live'' website; selected concerts have been offered from 2002 to the present.    
  
In July [[2006 in music|2006]], Hornsby released a 4 CD/1 DVD box set titled ''[[Intersections (1985-2005)]]''.  The discs are thematically broken into three categories: “Top 90 Time,” “Solo Piano, Tribute Records, Country-Bluegrass, Movie Scores,” and “By Request (Favorites and Best Songs)” (2 CDs), with a full third of the music previously unreleased, and the majority of the remaining tracks from single “B” sides and aforementioned collaborations and/or tribute albums and movie soundtracks.<ref name="allaboutjazz-intersections">{{cite web | last=Kelman | first=John | title=Bruce Hornsby: Intersections &#91;1985-2005&#93; | publisher=All About Jazz | date=2006 | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/20061103_allaboutjazz_review.swf | format=[[SWF]] | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  Some noteworthy collaborations include a piano-and-[[saxophone]] duet with [[Ornette Coleman]] and a performance with [[Roger Waters]] of [[Pink Floyd]]'s "Comfortably Numb."<ref name="stewartoksenhorn">{{cite web | last=Oksenhorn | first=Stewart | title=Hornsby reworks classics and takes a bluegrass ride: A Review | publisher=The Aspen Times | date=[[2007-03-09]] | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/20070309_aspentimes_review.swf | format=[[SWF]] | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  The set also offers a number of excellent examples of Hornsby's re-inventiveness with his own compositions, particularly in a live setting<ref>{{cite web | last=Tamarkin | first=Jeff | title=Intersections &#91;1985-2005&#93;: Overview | publisher=All Media Guide, LLC | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gxfixqqdldse | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>, for instance three different versions of “The Valley Road” are included--a live "bluesy funk" version with the Noise Makers, a [[Grammy]]-winning [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] version with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], and "a loose and sloppy but totally grooving boogie" take with the Grateful Dead.<ref name="allaboutjazz-intersections" />  Critics have said that Hornsby's particular integrations of different musical genres, and his passion for reinventing his own compositions, create a kind of music many might "never hear" otherwise as it is "a kind of music no one else is making."<ref name="paulzollo" />  All ticketholders on Hornsby's 2006 Solo Piano tour received a free copy of this set.  Among ''Intersections (1985-2005)'' is the Grammy nominated track "Song H," a new composition which competed for Best Pop Instrumental at the 2007 [[Grammy Awards]].

==Skaggs & Hornsby/The Bruce Hornsby Trio (2007-present)==

With the arrival of 2007, Hornsby would see two new musical projects come to fruition with the release of two new albums.

[[Image:SkaggsHornsby.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The bluegrass album '''''Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby''''' (2007) topped Billboard's Bluegrass charts for several weeks after its release in March]]

Dating back to a [[2000 in music|2000]] collaboration on the track "Darlin' Cory" for ''Big Mon'', a [[Bill Monroe]] [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tribute album, Bruce Hornsby and [[Ricky Skaggs]] had discussed launching a project together.<ref name="musicbox-skaggsandhornsby">{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=John | title=Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby: Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby | journal=The Music Box | volume=14 | issue=4 | date=April 2007 | url=http://www.musicbox-online.com/reviews-2007/ricky-skaggs-bruce-hornsby.html | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  In [[March]] 2007, the duo, backed by Skaggs's band Kentucky Thunder, released the bluegrass album ''[[Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby]]'', and set several tourdates together.   '''Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby''' combine bluegrass, traditional [[country]], "a tinge of Hornsby's jazzy piano and a splash of humor" on a spectrum of songs from the traditional "Across the Rocky Mountain" and "Hills of Mexico" to new compositions such as the opening track "The 
Dreaded Spoon," "a humorous tale of a youthful ice cream heist."<ref name="skaggs-hornsby-review">{{cite web | title=Music reviews of The Rounders, Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby and Uncle Earl | publisher=The Evansville Courier Co | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/20070323_courierpress_review.swf | format=[[SWF]] | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>  The pair also reinvent Hornsby's hit "Mandolin Rain" as a minor key acoustic ballad and "give his cautionary tale of backwoods violence", "A Night On the Town," a treatment highlighting the "Appalachian storytelling tradition that was always at the song's heart."<ref name="skaggs-hornsby-review" /> 
The album ends a surprise cover of [[Rick James]]'s [[funk]] hit "[[Super Freak]]" in a bluegrass arrangement.  ''Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby'' would top [[Billboard]]'s bluegrass charts for several weeks after its release.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Skaggs and Hornsby on Conan Tonight; NY Times Praises Live Show | publisher=Shore Fire Media | date=[[2007-04-27]] | url=http://www.shorefire.com/index.php?a=pressrelease&o=970 | accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref>  As Hornsby carves out a newfound place for [[piano]] within traditional bluegrass, disproving the notion that the piano is not compatible with "string-oriented" bluegrass<ref name="stewartoksenhorn" />, critics have called his playing and songwriting "centered, focused, and inspired."<ref name="musicbox-skaggsandhornsby" /> 

[[Image:Hornsbycamp.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The album '''''Camp Meeting''''' (2007), set for release on August 7, marks Hornsby's first jazz release and first album with The Bruce Hornsby Trio]]  Simultaneous to the bluegrass project, Bruce Hornsby has formed '''The Bruce Hornsby Trio''' and recorded a [[jazz]] album titled ''[[Camp Meeting (album)|Camp Meeting]]''.  Hornsby is joined in his trio by jazz giants [[Christian McBride]] ([[Double bass|bass]]) and [[Jack DeJohnette]] ([[drums]]).  A release in [[August]] 2007 is expected.<ref>{{cite web | title=Newsletter | publisher=Bruce Hornsby | date=2005 | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/newsletter.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  Alongside original compositions by Hornsby, the trio delivers "newly reharmonized versions" of tunes by [[John Coltrane]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Bud Powell]], and a previously unrecorded Ornette Coleman work titled "Questions and Answers" as well as an early [[Keith Jarrett]] composition "Death and the Flower."<ref>{{cite web | title="Camp Meeting" Press Release | publisher=Legacy Recordings | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/2007_camp_meeting_release.swf | accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref>  The trio will make a series of appearances in the summer of 2007, at the [[Playboy Jazz Festival]], the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], and at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], among other bookings.<ref name="hamptonroadsmag" /><ref>{{cite web | title=Tour dates | publisher=Bruce Hornsby | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/tour.htm | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>

During 2007, Hornsby made concert appearances of historical import.  On [[January 4]], former [[Grateful Dead]] members [[Bob Weir]], [[Bill Kreutzmann]] and [[Mickey Hart]] reunited along with Hornsby, [[Mike Gordon]] (of [[Phish]] and the [[Rhythm Devils]]) and [[Warren Haynes]] to play two sets at a post-inauguration fundraising party for [[Nancy Pelosi]], the first woman to serve as [[Speaker of the House]] in the [[United States Congress]].  They were billed as "Your House Band" and performed some Dead classics such as "[[Truckin']]" and "[[Touch of Grey]]". Other performers appearing at the event included [[Tony Bennett]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Carol King]]. <ref>{{cite web | last=Pryor | first=Tom | title=Dead, Phish, Allmans Members Serve as "House Band" for Pelosi-palooza | publisher=Relix LLC | date=[[2007-01-05]] | url=http://www.relix.com/content/view/2053/112/ | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  Additionally, Bruce Hornsby & The Noise Makers hosted an evening of [[rock music|rock]], [[R&B]] and progressive bluegrass on [[May 12]], 2007, to honor America's beginnings 400 years ago at [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. Hornsby was joined by some of his [[Grammy]]-winning friends, including legendary [[funk]] and R&B artist [[Chaka Khan]] and progressive bluegrass master Ricky Skaggs and his band Kentucky Thunder.<ref>{{cite web | title=Grammy Award Winners Bruce Hornsby, Chaka Khan and Ricky Skaggs Headline America's 400th Anniversary Concert | publisher=SYS-CON Media Inc. | date=[[2007-03-08]] | url=http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/20070308_marketwire_jamestown.swf | format=[[SWF]] | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref> 

Bruce Hornsby has also been writing songs for a [[Broadway Musical]].  One song from this project, a playful biographical tune titled "Donald Trump Song," has made several appearances in setlists during Hornsby's early-2007 solo piano performances.<ref name="hamptonroadsmag" />

Outside of music composition and performance, Hornsby has taken an ownership interest in Williamsburg area radio station "The Tide", WTYD 92.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]], and he has endowed a [[scholarship]] at [[University of Miami]]'s School of Music, encouraging recipients to study songwriting broadly across traditional genres.<ref name="hamptonroadsmag" />  He continues to reside with his family outside of [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].
