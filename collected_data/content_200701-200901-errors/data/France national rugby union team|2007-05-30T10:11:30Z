The '''France national rugby union team''' is a national sporting side, representing [[France]] in [[rugby union]]. Rugby union is a popular sport in France, and the national team are one of the best in the world. France compete annually with [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] in the [[Six Nations Championship]]. They have won the competition outright on 14 occasions, shared in another eight wins and completed eight [[Grand_Slam_%28Rugby_Union%29#Six_Nations_Championship|grand slams]]. They are the [[IRB World Rankings|second-ranked team]] in the world, behind only the [[All Blacks]].<ref name=WorldRank>{{cite web | publisher=irb.com|title=IRB World Rankings |url=http://www.irb.com/EN/World+Rankings/  |accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> France have competed at every [[Rugby World Cup]] and been runners-up twice. Six former French players have been inducted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]].

Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by the British and on [[New Year's Day]], [[1906]] the national side played its first [[Test match]] - against the All Blacks in Paris. France played irregularly against the [[Home Nations]] until they joined them to form a Five Nations tournament (today, the Six Nations) in 1910. France also competed in early [[Summer Olympics]] when rugby was included - winning one gold and two silver medals.

France came of age during the 1950s and 1960s, winning their first of many Five Nations. They won their first [[Grand Slam (rugby union)#Six Nations Championship|Grand Slam]] in 1968, and won numerous titles in the following years. Since the inaugural World Cup in 1987, France qualified for the  knock out stage of every tournament, and were runners-up to the All Blacks in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and to [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]].

France traditionally play in [[blue]] shirts with [[white]] shorts and [[red]] socks, and are commonly referred to as the ''les tricolors'' or ''les bleus''. The French emblem is a red badge with a [[rooster]]. Their alternative strip is mainly white. French internationals are played at a variety of venues throughout the country, but it is [[Stade de France]] in the [[Paris]] suburb of [[Saint-Denis]] that is used for their games during the Six Nations. France are the host nation of the upcoming [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].

==Strip==
[[Image:Logo XV de france.JPG|250px|thumb|A uniform of the French rugby team, with the traditional rooster symbol.]]
Until 1912, the uniform of the French team was not blue and did not have a rooster on it, but was white with two rings, one red and one blue. The rings were chosen by France  as its symbol for the Olympic games, there were only two rings because only two continents, America and Europe, participated in the Olympic games at that time.<ref name="logo1">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://www.sncf.com/actu/rugby/LSDT-premier-maillot-Equipe-France.html| title=Le premier maillot de l'Equipe de France | publisher=Sncf.com | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

After the first game won by France, against Scotland in 1911, Marcel Communeau who was then captain of the French team, asked that the team adopt the ''coq'' (rooster) as its symbol.<ref name="logo2">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://rugby-nomades.qc.ca/info-nomades/histoire_1911.php| title=2 janvier 1911 : la naissance d’une Nation | publisher=Rugby-nomades.qc.ca | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The rooster was probably chosen because it is considered as a proud and combative animal, that can be sometimes aggressive. The rooster was used previously as a symbol by a French team, a former soccer player, Jean Rigal, wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910.<ref name="logo3">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-02.pdf| title=Le coq dans le sport  | publisher=Crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

The badge was initially white and red, then was embroidered and multicoloured after 1945, and golden since 1970.<ref name="logo4">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-01.pdf| title=Le coq sportif | publisher=Crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The representation of the rooster was first realistic and detailed, later the outline was simplified; it is now abstract and stylized.

The symbol used by the French rugby team was a great success, and was later adopted by the French delegation at the Olympic games of 1920 where the rooster is perched on five Olympic rings.<ref name="logo5">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://www.museedusport.fr/histoire_objet.php| title=Ecusson en forme de coq, devenu emblème national | publisher=Musee du Sport | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The rooster is a well known symbol of French teams. French players are sometimes called ''les coqs'' and some French supporters used to release a rooster on the playing field before a game.

The French team traditionally played in Blue shirts, whites shorts, and red socks, and as such they were nicknamed ''les tricolores''. Due to the mostly blue [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] strip the French team currently plays in, the team being is often referred to as ''les Bleus'' (The Blue). When necessary (home games against Scotland and Italy), French players wear white colours. The reason for the home side changing strip is due to the rugby tradition of the home side changing strips in the event of a colour clash. New strips have been developed for the 2007 World Cup - one which is a darker blue - which would likely see the All Blacks wear grey if they were to meet in the tournament.<ref name="new">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/default.aspx?id=72647&cat=977| title=All Blacks may not be all black | publisher=NZ City | accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> It was rumoured to be a move to gain a psychological edge over the All Blacks, but this was dismissed.<ref name="new"/>

==Home grounds==
[[Image:France All Blacks 16-11-2002.jpg|thumb|250px|left|France hosting the All Blacks at the Stade de France.]]
France plays internationals at a number of grounds throughout the country. Home matches during the Six Nations are played at [[Stade de France]], [[Saint Denis]] ([[Paris]]).<ref name=sixnationsvenues>{{cite web | publisher=rbs6nations.com | title=Stade de France|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/stadium_france.htm|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> During the 2005 and 2006 seasons, France also played home internationals at venues such as [[Stade Gerland]], [[Lyon]]; [[Stade Vélodrome]], [[Marseille]]; [[Stade de la Beaujoire]], [[Nantes]] and [[Stadium Municipal|Stadium de Toulouse]], [[Toulouse]].<ref>An archive of international results can be found at [http://www.irb.com/EN/Fixtures+and+Results/ www.irb.com] accessed [[2007-05-06]]</ref>

At the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], there are ten venues being used for matches throughout the country (Cardiff, Wales and Edinburgh, Scotland will also host some games).<ref name=wcvenues>{{cite web | publisher=rugbyworldcup.com | title=Destination France|url=http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/EN/Destination+France/|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> The French cities hosting matches at the World Cup are [[Stade Félix Bollaert]], [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]]; Stade de France, Saint-Denis; [[Parc des Princes]], [[Paris]]; Stade de la Beaujoire, Nantes; [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], [[Bordeaux]], Stade Gerland, Lyon; [[Stade Geoffroy-Guichard]], [[Saint-Étienne]], [[Stade de la Mosson]], [[Montpellier]]; Stadium de Toulouse, Toulouse and Stade Vélodrome, Marseille.<ref name="wcvenues"/> The final of the World Cup will be played at Stade de France.

Though 2007 is the first Rugby World Cup hosted by France, there have been multiple games played in France earlier during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]] tournaments (primarily hosted by England and Wales respectively). In 1991, all Pool D matches (France's pool) were held around France, along with two quarter finals (England v France at Parc des Princes and New Zealand v Canada at [[Stadium Lille-Metropole]]).<ref name="1991RWCVenues">{{cite web| url=http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/1991.asp |publisher=worldcupweb.com |accessdate=2007-05-06 |title=1991 Rugby World Cup Results}}</ref> In 1999, similar to 1991, all Pool C (France's pool) matches were held around France along with one second round play-off and quarter final (at Stade de France).<ref name="1999RWCvenues">{{cite web| url=http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/1999.asp |title=1999 Rugby World Cup Results |publisher=worldcupweb.com |accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref>

During the early years France played internationals at venues such as Parc des Princes in Paris and the [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir|Stade Olympique de Colombes]] (also in Paris).<ref name=parc>{{cite web | publisher=2rugby.com | title=Parc des Princes|url=http://2rugby.com/ground/26/|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref><ref name=colom>{{cite web | publisher=2rugby.com | title=Stade Colombes|url=http://2rugby.com/ground/27/|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> The Stade Olympique de Colombes, or the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, was the main venue at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], where rugby was also a sport.<ref name="olympics"/> The largest stadium that France currently plays at is the Stade de France, which is where the [[Top 14]] final is also held - it has a capacity of 80,000.<ref name=sixnationsvenues/>

==Record==
===Six Nations===
Frances' only annual tournament is the [[Six Nations Championship]], which is played against five other European Nations; England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. France first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations (Italy would later join in 2000).<ref name="RollofHonour">{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/3422419.stm |title=Six Nations roll of honour |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-05-03 |date=[[2004-01-29]]}}</ref> Not playing during the 1932–1939 seasons, they would join again in 1947. They first won in 1954, sharing the championship with both England and Wales. France shared with Wales again the next season, but won it alone for the first time in 1959.<ref name="RollofHonour"/> France's longest wait for a championship spanned 37 tournaments (1910 to 1954).

==Training and selection==
===Coaches===
Historically the role of French rugby coach (or ''trainer'') has varied significantly. Due to the status of rugby union as an amateur sport for most of it's history, the job of deciding tactics and running team trainings has often been that of the captain or senior players. Therefore a comprehensive list of national coaches is impossible. 

Although coached by [[Jean Desclaux]] between 1973 and 1980, the French team's main influence during the late 1970 was captain [[Jacques Fouroux]]. Fouroux played {{scrum-half}} and captained France to their 1977 Five Nations Grand Slam where France played a very forward oriented style of rugby.<ref name="Dine155">Dine (2001), pg 155.</ref> Although the style of ''Fouroux's Gang'' was successful it was criticised because it contrasted with the traditional open attacking style of French rugby.<ref name="Dine155"/> Fouroux was given the nickname "the little Corporal" - the same as [[Napolean Bonaparte]].<ref name="FourouxTelObituary">{{cite web| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/20/db2002.xml |title=Jacques Fouroux |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date=[[2005-12-20]] |accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> Fouroux was named as Cazenave's successor in 1981 at the age of just 33. He continued to promote a forward oriented style of play and France won six Five Nations titles, including two Grand Slams while he was coach. After nearly ten years as French coach he resigned in 1990 after a defeat to Romania.<ref name="Dine160">Dine (2001), pg 160.</ref>

Fouroux was succeeded by [[Daniel Dubroca]] who coached the team to the 1991 Rugby World Cup.<ref name="Brine172">Brine (2001), pg 172-173.</ref> Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long however as he resigned after violently confronting referee [[David Bishop]] following France's World Cup quarter-final against England.<ref name="Brine172"/><ref name="1992IHT">{{cite news| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/03/19/rugb.php |title=French, in Anglo-Saxon Game, Can No Longer Rest on Latin Laurels |publisher=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=2007-05-06 |date=[[1992-03-19]] |last=Patel |first=Tara}}</ref> Dubroca was replaced by [[Pierre Berbizier]] who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup.<ref name="BerbizierAttack">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/6311205.stm |title=Berbizier launches Laporte attack |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-05-06 |date=[[2007-01-29]]}}</ref> Berbizier's replacement [[Jean-Claude Skrela]] coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they got the wooden spoon in 1999.<ref name="SkrelaQuit">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/rugby_union/523219.stm |title=Sport: Rugby Union Skrela steps down as French coach |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-05-06 |date=[[1999-11-16]]}}</ref> He told the FFR he would step down prior to the 1999 Rugby World Cup, and officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the tournament final. [[Bernard Laporte]] was appointed as Skrela's successor in November 1999 and has held the position ever since.<ref name="LaporteAppointed">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/rugby_union/532229.stm |title=Laporte gets France job |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-05-06 |date=[[1999-11-22]]}}</ref>
