'''''The Daily Show''''' (known in its current incarnation as '''''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''''') is a [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[news satire|satirical]] [[television program]] airing each Monday through Thursday on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States. The half-hour long show premiered on Monday, July 22, 1996, and was hosted by [[Craig Kilborn]], who acted as its [[anchorman]] until his departure in December 1998. [[Jon Stewart]] took over as host in January 1999, bringing a number of changes to the show's content.  Under Stewart ''The Daily Show'' has become more strongly focused around politics and the national media, in contrast with the more character-driven focus during Kilborn's tenure.

Describing itself as a "fake news" program, ''The Daily Show'' draws its comedy from recent news stories, satirizing political figures and media organizations.  The show typically opens with a [[monologue]] from the host relating to recent headlines and frequently features exchanges with one or more of several [[List of The Daily Show correspondents|correspondents]], who adopt absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against Stewart's [[straight man]] persona.  The final act is reserved for a celebrity interview, with guests ranging from actors and musicians to nonfiction authors and political figures.

The program has increasingly grown in popularity since Stewart took over hosting with organizations such as the [[Pew Research Center]] claiming that it has become a primary source of news for many young people, an assertion the show's staff have repeatedly rejected.  Critics, including series co-creator [[Lizz Winstead]], have chastised Stewart for not conducting hard-hitting enough interviews with his political guests, some of whom he may have previously lampooned in other segments; while others have criticized the show as having a [[liberal bias]].  Stewart and other ''Daily Show'' writers have responded to both criticisms by saying that they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment.

In 2005, Comedy Central launched a [[spin-off]] show, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', starring long-time ''Daily Show'' correspondent [[Stephen Colbert]].  The two shows run back-to-back and continue to have regular interaction with one another, and Stewart will frequently "toss" to Colbert at the end of an episode.  A weekly "Global Edition" of ''The Daily Show'' has been created for overseas markets and airs on foreign networks as well as [[CNN International]].

Each episode begins with voiceover artist Drew Birns announcing the date and the introduction, "From Comedy Central's World News Headquarters in New York, this is ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart."''<ref name="dailynews" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Staff writer|url=http://www.backstage.com/bso/news_reviews/other_news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003156883&inp=true|title=Drew Birns, Voiceover Artist|work=Backstage|date=2006-09-25|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> The host, Jon Stewart, then opens the show with a monologue of news headlines. Previously, the show divided its news commentary into sections known as "Headlines", "Other News", and "This Just In"; these titles were dropped sometime around 2003. The monologue is often followed by an exchange with a correspondent—typically introduced as the show's "senior" specialist in the subject at hand—either at the anchor desk with Stewart or reporting from a false location in front of a [[green screen]].  Their stated areas of expertise vary depending on the news story that is being discussed, and can range from relatively general (such as "Senior Political Analyst") to absurdly specific (such as "Senior Child Molestation Expert").<ref>{{cite web|author=Humphrey, Steven|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=39695&category=34029|title=The Best Paintball Movie You'll See All Year!|work=The Portland Mercury|date=2006-06-08|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>   The correspondents typically present absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against Stewart's [[Comic foil|straight man]].<ref name="Age">{{cite web|author=Nguyen, Keneth|url=http://www.theage.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2004/01/21/1074360828900.html|title=News Takes a Beating|work=The Age|date=2004-01-22|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>  While correspondents stated to be reporting abroad are usually performing in-studio in front of a green screen, on rare occasions cast members have recorded pieces on location.  For instance, during the week of August 20, 2007, the show aired a series of segments called "Operation Silent Thunder: The Daily Show in Iraq" in which correspondent [[Rob Riggle]] reported from Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff writer|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1003628299|title=From Green Screen to Green Zone: 'Daily Show' Goes to Iraq -- for Real -- And Airs First Report|work=Editor & Publisher|date=2007-08-20|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref>  In August 2008, Riggle traveled to China for a series of segments titled "Rob Riggle: [[Chasing the dragon|Chasing the Dragon]]", which focused on the ongoing [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Bauder, David|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/776/story/636475.html|title=Rob Riggle's off the hook in China|work=Miami Herald|date=2008-08-11|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref>

The news portion is often followed by correspondent field pieces and interviews, the order of which varies from episode to episode. These field segments feature a rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members traveling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people related to the featured issue. Topics have varied widely; during the early years of the show they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as [[Bigfoot]] enthusiasts, but since Stewart began hosting in 1999 the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to closer reflect current issues and debates.<ref name="Colbert interview" />  Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were not aware or entirely aware of the comedic nature of ''The Daily Show''.  However, since the show began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed are "in" on the comedic element.<ref name="Larris" />

[[The Daily Show recurring elements|Some segments]] recur periodically, such as "Back in Black" with [[Lewis Black]], "This Week in God" and "Are You Prepared?!?" with [[Samantha Bee]], "Trendspotting" with [[Demetri Martin]] and "Wilmore-Oliver Investigates" with [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] and [[Larry Wilmore]]. Since the early days of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], a common part of the show has been "[[Mesopotamia|Mess O' Potamia]]", focusing on the United States' policies in the [[Middle East]], especially [[Iraq]].<ref name="Kurtz">{{cite web|author=Kurtz, Howard|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55440-2004Oct22.html|title=The Campaign of a Comedian|work=The Washington Post|date=2004-10-23|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> Elections in the United States have been a prominent focus in the show's "Indecision" coverage throughout Stewart's time as host.  During the 2000, 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, the show was taken on the road to record week-long specials from the cities hosting the [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-18-jon-stewart_x.htm|title=Jon Stewart to remain at 'Daily Show'|work=USA Today|date=2004-03-18|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>  For the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], a week of episodes was recorded in the contested state of [[Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-08-25-daily-ohio_x.htm|title='Daily Show' to take road trip to Ohio|work=USA Today|date=2006-08-25|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>  The "Indecision" coverage of the 2000 and 2004 elections culminated in a live [[Election Day|Election Night]] special.<ref>{{cite web|author=CBC Arts|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/08/05/candidates-daily-show.html|title=Comedic campaign stop: Presidential candidates hit The Daily Show|work=CBC.ca|date=2007-08-05|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

In the show's third act, the host conducts an interview with a celebrity guest. Guests come from a wide range of cultural sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, pundits and political figures.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff writer|url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2006/12/03/dailyshow-karlin-leaves.html|title=Executive producer quits The Daily Show, Colbert Report|work=CBC News|date=2006-12-03|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>   Since Stewart became host, the show's guest list has tended away from celebrities and more towards non-fiction authors and political pundits, as well as many prominent elected officials.<ref name="Kurtz" />  While in the show's earlier years it struggled to book high-profile politicians—in 1999, for an ''Indecision 2000'' segment, [[Steve Carell]] struggled to talk his way off Republican candidate [[John McCain]]'s press overflow bus and onto the [[Straight Talk Express]]—it has since risen in popularity, particularly following the show's coverage of the 2000 and 2004 elections.  In 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described ''The Daily Show'' under Stewart as "the hot destination for anyone who wants to sell books or seem hip, from presidential candidates to military dictators", while ''[[Newsweek]]'' calls it "the coolest pit stop on television".<ref>{{cite web|author=Dowd, Maureen|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors|title=America's Anchors|work=Rolling Stone|date=[[2006-10-31]]|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref><ref name="most trusted" />  Prominent political guests have included former [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Clinton]], former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]], former [[Pakistan]]i President [[Pervez Musharraf]], [[Bolivia]]n President [[Evo Morales]], [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Al Gore]] and [[Second Lady of the United States]] [[Lynne Cheney]].  The show has played host to former and current members of the Administration and Cabinet as well as members of Congress and presidential candidates.  [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]], [[John Edwards]], [[John Kerry]], [[Chris Dodd]], [[Joe Biden]], [[John McCain]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Bill Richardson]], [[Howard Dean]], [[Ron Paul]] and [[Ralph Nader]] have each appeared on the show while running for president.  On September 13, 2006, a new portion of the interview segment began called "The Seat of Heat", wherein the host would ask a guest one challenging or bizarre question to be answered. The segment was short-lived, and by the end of 2006 it had been discontinued.

In a closing segment sometimes referred to as the "toss," Stewart has a short exchange with "our good friend, [[Stephen Colbert]] at ''[[The Colbert Report]]''", which airs immediately after. This check-in first appeared following ''The Colbert Report'''s premiere in October 2005 and was initially featured daily, but in 2007 was cut back to twice per week.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=87169&title=comrades Comrades] | episodelink =  | series = The Daily Show | airdate = 2007-05-21 | season = 12 | number = }}</ref>  After this, there is a segue to the closing credits in the form of "Your Moment of Zen", a humorous piece of video footage that has been part of the show's wrap-up since the series began in 1996.<ref name="zen">{{cite web|author=Scott, A.

=== Studio ===
[[Image:Daily Show studio.JPG|thumb|upright|The outside of the current ''Daily Show'' studio]]
The program features Stewart sitting at a desk on an elevated island stage in the style of a traditional news show. The show relocated from its original New York studio in mid-1998 to offices in [[New York City|New York City's]]  [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood where it remained until 2005, when the studio was claimed by ''Daily Show'' spin-off series ''The Colbert Report''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Huff, Richard|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/08/11/1998-08-11_jon_stewart_to_anchor__daily.html|title=Jon Stewart to Anchor 'Daily Show' Comedy Central Names Comic as Craig Kilborn's Replacement|work=New York Daily News|date=1998-08-11|accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref>  On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio at 733 11th Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, a few blocks west of its former location.  NEP Studio 52 is owned by [[NEP Broadcasting]] which is New York City's largest production facility owner and also owns the show's previous NEP Studio 54.<ref>{{cite web|author=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122505|title=Colbert set for 'Daily Show' spinoff|work=Pittsburgh Tribune Review|date=2005-09-10|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>

The set of the new studio was given a sleeker, more formal look, including a backdrop of three large projection screens.  The traditional guests' couch, which had been a part of the set since the show's premiere, was done away with in favor of simple upright chairs. The change was initially not well-received, spawning a backlash among some fans and prompting a "Bring Back the Couch Campaign". The campaign was mentioned on subsequent shows by Stewart and [[Media:PSA-BAW.jpg|supported]] by ''Daily Show'' contributor [[Bob Wiltfong]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Stevens, Dana|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122505|title=Talk Show Feng Shui|work=Slate|date=2005-07-12|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Susman, Gary|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2005/07/daily_show_scan.html|title='Daily Show' scandal: That new set|work=EW.com|date=2005-07-20|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> The couch was eventually made the prize in a ''Daily Show '' sweepstakes in which the winner received the couch, round trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show and a small sum of money.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ebenkamp, Becky|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/branding-brand-development/4682113-1.html|title=The Biz: Food Net Unwraps Pop Secrets; Stewart's Sofa Sent to Suburbia|work=Brandweek|date=2005-06-30|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>

On April 9, 2007 the show debuted a new set. The projection screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, a more open studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all streamlined.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sandberg, Marian|url=http://livedesignonline.com/venues/daily_dose/|title=Daily Dose|work=Live Design Online|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>

===Production===
The show's writers begin each day with a morning meeting where they review material researchers have gathered from major newspapers, the [[Associated Press]], [[cable television|cable]] news channels and websites, and discuss headline material for the lead news segment. Throughout the morning they work on writing deadline pieces inspired by recent news, as well as longer-term projects.  By lunchtime, Stewart—who describes his role as that of a [[managing editor]]—has begun to review headline jokes.  The script is submitted by 3 p.m., and at 4:15 there is a rehearsal.  An hour is left for rewrites before a 6 p.m. taping in front of a live studio audience.<ref name="dailynews">{{cite web|author=Levin, Gary|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-10-06-daily_x.htm|title=Fans like their dose of 'Daily' news Stewart dishes some seriously funny stuff|work=USA Today|date=2003-10-07|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref><ref name="most trusted">{{cite web|author=Kakutani, Michiko|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/arts/television/17kaku.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2|title=The Most Trusted Man in America?|work=New York Times|date=2008-08-15|accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref>  While the studio capacity is limited, tickets to attend tapings are free and can be obtained if requested far enough in advance.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sisario, Ben|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/16/arts/television/16chea.html?ex=1329282000&en=bf58681b71ecdfd4&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=Live From New York, It's Cold People Waiting in Line|work=New York Times|date=2007-02-16|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>

The program is rerun several times the next day, including an 8 PM Eastern/7 PM Central [[primetime]] broadcast.

==History==
===With Craig Kilborn (1996–1998)===
[[Image:DailyShowKilborn.jpg|thumb|Craig Kilborn is seen hosting an episode of ''The Daily Show'' in 1997.]]

''The Daily Show'' was created by [[Lizz Winstead]] and [[Madeleine Smithberg]] and premiered on Comedy Central in the summer of 1996, having been marketed as a replacement for ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' (a successful Comedy Central program that had moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] earlier that year).<ref>{{cite web|author=Lambert, Brian|url=http://members.tripod.com/~lizzland/news/060897.html|title="Daily Show" is Morning Drive Radio for TV|work=St. Paul Pioneer-Press|date=1997-06-08|accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> Aimed to parody conventional newscasts, it featured a comedic monologue of the day's headlines, [[mockumentary]] style on-location reports, in-studio segments, guest commentary, and debates. Parodying the habit of entertainment news programs to lead out to commercials with trivia such as celebrity birthdays, the show featured such segments as "This Day in [[David Hasselhoff|Hasselhoff]] History" and "Last Weekend's Top-Grossing Films, Converted into [[Lira]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=James, Caryn|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1DD143FF932A3575BC0A960958260|title=A Parody Of Shows Covering Pop News|work=The New York Times|date=1996-08-01|accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref>  In each show Kilborn would conduct celebrity interviews, ending with a segment called "Five Questions", in which the guest was made to answer a series of questions that were typically a combination of obscure fact and subjective opinion.<ref>{{cite web|author=Schillaci, Jack|url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/feb/02-07-97/arts/arts6.html|title=Kilborn provides daily fun|work=The Michigan Daily|date=1997-02-07|accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref>  These are highlighted in a 1998 book titled ''The Daily Show: Five Questions'', which contains transcripts of Kilborn's best interviews.<ref>{{cite book |author=Comedy Central |title= The Daily Show: Five Questions |publisher= Andrews Mcmeel Publishing |year= 1998 |month= April |isbn= 0-8362-5325-6 }}</ref>  Each episode was capped off with a segment called "Your Moment of Zen" that showed random video clips of humorous and sometimes morbid interest such as visitors at a Chinese zoo feeding baby chicks to the alligators.<ref>{{cite web|author=Beale, Lewis|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1996/10/07/1996-10-07_a__daily__dose_of_irreverence.html|title=A "Daily" Dose of Irreverance|work=New York Daily News|date=1996-10-07|accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref>  Originally the show was recorded without a studio audience, featuring only the laughter of its own off-camera staff members.

The show was much less politically-focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Colbert described as a "local news" feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor.<ref name="Colbert interview" />  Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate as to how political the show should be, with the network pushing for "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics".  There was concern that the more news-driven focus Winstead wanted would not be as appealing to viewers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Winstead, Lizz|url=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2008/04/qa_with_daily_show_creator_liz.php|title=Q&A With Daily Show Creator Lizz Winstead|work=Westword|date=2008-04-23|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a fact acknowledged by some of the show's cast.  Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, "You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces."<ref>{{cite web|author=Thompson, Stephen|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22599|title=Interview: The Daily Show's Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms, and Mo Rocca|work=The A.V.

There were reports of backstage friction between Kilborn and some of the female staff, particularly the show's co-creator Lizz Winstead. Winstead had not been involved in the hiring of Kilborn, and disagreed with him over what the focus of the show should be.  "I spent eight months developing and staffing a show and seeking a tone with producers and writers. Somebody else put him in place. There were bound to be problems. I viewed the show as content-driven; he viewed it as host-driven," she said.<ref>{{cite web|author=C.J.|url=http://members.tripod.com/~lizzland/news/020898a.html|title=Winstead walks over crude quips|work=The Minneapolis Star-Tribune|date=1998-02-08|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>  In a 1997 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine interview, Kilborn made offensive comments about his female coworkers, describing them as "emotional people" and "bitches" and making a sexually explicit remark about Winstead. Comedy Central responded by suspending Kilborn without pay for one week, and Winstead quit soon after.<ref>{{cite web|author=Carter, Bill|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E6DD133FF934A25751C1A961958260|title=TV Notes; Comedy Host In Hot Water|work=The New York Times|date=1997-12-17|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

In 1998 Kilborn left ''The Daily Show'' in order to replace [[Tom Snyder]] on CBS's ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]''.

===With Jon Stewart (1999–present)===

==== Shift in content ====
Comedian Jon Stewart took over as host of the show, which was retitled ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'', on Monday, January 11, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=McConville, Jim|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1999/99_0125electronic.html|title=Jon Stewart: Building His Own House At Comedy Central|work=Electronic Media|date=1999-01-25|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref> Stewart had previously hosted two shows on [[MTV]] (''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'' and an [[The Jon Stewart Show|eponymous talk show]]), as well as a syndicated late-night talk show, and had been cast in films and television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Howard, Susan|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/94_0000record.html|title=Nighttime Talk, MTV Style|work=The Record|date=1994|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>  In taking over hosting from Kilborn, Stewart retained much of the same staff and on-air talent, allowing many pieces to transition without much trouble, while other features like "God Stuff", with [[Joe Bob Briggs|John Bloom]] presenting an assortment of actual clips from various televangelists, and "Backfire", an in-studio debate between Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown, evolved into the similar pieces of "This Week in God" and Stephen Colbert and [[Steve Carell]]'s "Even Stevphen". Since the change, a number of new features have been, and continue to be, developed. The ending segment "Your Moment of Zen", previously consisting of a random selection of humorous videos, was expanded to sometimes include recaps or extended versions of news clips shown earlier in the show.<ref name="zen" /> The show's theme music, "Dog on Fire" by [[Bob Mould]], was re-recorded by [[They Might Be Giants]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Menconi, David|url=http://blogsarchive.newsobserver.com/beat/index.php?m=20061104|title=The fine print of truthiness|work=The News & Observer|date=2006-11-04|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Leopold, Todd|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/12/tmbg/|title=They Might Be Giants: It's OK to call us whatever|work=CNN|date=2001-04-12|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>

Unlike Kilborn, whose dialogue and character were written entirely by others, Stewart served not only as host but also as a writer and executive producer of the series.  Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of ''[[The Onion]]'', [[Ben Karlin]], who, along with fellow ''Onion'' writer [[David Javerbaum]], joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer.  Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things "[started] to take shape".  Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, "The main thing, for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying things that you know they don't believe."<ref name="Larris">{{cite web|author=Larris, Rachel|url=http://cct.georgetown.edu/academics/theses/RachelLarris.pdf|title=The Daily Show Effect: Humor, News, Knowledge and Viewers|work=Georgetown University|date=2005-05-02|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref>

Under Stewart and Karlin ''The Daily Show'' developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Former correspondent Stephen Colbert says that whereas under Kilborn the focus was on "human interest-y" pieces, with Stewart as host the show's content became more "issues and news driven", particularly after the beginning of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] campaign with which the show dealt in its "[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2000|Indecision 2000]]" coverage.<ref>{{cite web|author=Schneider, Jacqueline|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a238.asp|title=So What Do You Do, Stephen Colbert?|work=Media Bistro|date=2003-05-06|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref><ref name="Colbert interview">{{cite web|author=Plume, Ken|url=http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/433/433111p1.html|title=An Interview with Stephen Colbert|work=IGN|date=2003-08-11|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>  Colbert recalls that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gross, Terry|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4464017|title=A Fake Newsman's Fake Newsman: Stephen Colbert|work=Fresh Air|date=2005-01-20|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

During Stewart's tenure, the role of the correspondent has broadened to encompass not only field segments but also frequent in-studio exchanges.  Under Kilborn, Colbert says that his work as a correspondent primarily involved "character driven [field] pieces—like, you know, guys who believe in Bigfoot."  However, as the focus of the show has become more news-driven, correspondents have increasingly been used in studio pieces, either as "experts" discussing issues at the anchor desk or as field journalists reporting from false locations in front of a green screen.  Colbert says that this change has allowed correspondents to be more involved with the show, as it has permitted them to work more closely with the host and writers.<ref name="Colbert interview" />

The show's 2000 and 2004 election coverage, combined with a new satirical edge, helped to catapult Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' to new levels of popularity and critical respect.<ref>{{cite web|author=Goodman, Tim|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/29/DDGSO9HI5F17.DTL|title=Jon Stewart, seriously, here to stay|work=SFGate|date=2004-10-29|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> Since Stewart became host, the show has won ten Emmy Awards and two Peabody Awards, and its ratings have dramatically increased.   In 2003, the show was averaging nearly a million viewers, an increase of nearly threefold since Stewart replaced Kilborn as host.<ref>{{cite web|author=Levin, Gary|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-10-06-daily-show_x.htm|title=Stewart elects to skewer recall live on 'Daily Show'|work=USA Today|date=2003-10-06|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

==== Writers' strike ====
Due to the [[2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]], the show went on [[hiatus]] on November 5, 2007.  Although the strike continued until February, 2008, the show returned to air on January 7, 2008, without its staff of writers. In solidarity with the writers, the show was referred to as ''A Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' rather than ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,'' until the end of the strike.<ref name="Introducing A Daily Show">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=147108&title=introducing-a-daily-show Introducing A Daily Show] | episodelink =  | series = The Daily Show | airdate = 2008-01-07 | season = 13 | number = }}</ref> As a member of the [[Writers Guild of America, East|Writers Guild of America]], Stewart was barred from writing any material for the show himself which he or his writers would ordinarily write.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Daily Show to return in January |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7155335.stm |publisher=''[[BBC]]'' |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>  As a result, Stewart and the correspondents largely [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]] the show around preplanned topics.<ref>{{cite web |last=Finn |first=Natalie |title=''Daily Show'', ''Colbert'' returning |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=aea7d8c1-9d37-4f12-a73e-bf128981ad32 |publisher=''[[E!]]'' |date=2007-12-20 |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> In an effort to fill time while keeping to these restrictions, the show aired or re-aired some previously recorded segments, and Stewart engaged in a briefly recurring [[Who Made Huckabee?|mock feud]] with fellow late-night hosts Stephen Colbert and [[Conan O'Brien]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23017599/  Conan, Stewart, Colbert unite in TV feud].

==Correspondents, contributors, and staff==
{{main|List of The Daily Show correspondents|List of The Daily Show writers}}

[[Image:Tds cast 2007-1.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart with correspondents Samantha Bee, Aasif Mandvi, Jason Jones, John Oliver and Rob Riggle]]
The show's correspondents have two principal roles: "experts" with satirical "senior" titles that Stewart interviews about certain issues, or hosts of field reporting segments which often involve humorous commentary and interviews relating to a current issue. The current team of correspondents includes [[Samantha Bee]], [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]], [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]], [[Rob Riggle]], [[Aasif Mandvi]], [[Larry Wilmore]], and [[Wyatt Cenac]].  Contributors such as [[Lewis Black]], [[Demetri Martin]], [[John Hodgman]]  and [[Kristen Schaal]] appear on a less frequent basis, often with their own unique recurring segment or character.  Ben Karlin says that the on-air talent contribute in many ways to the material they perform, playing an integral role in the creation of their field pieces as well as being involved with their scripted studio segments, either taking part early on in the writing process or adding improvised material during the rehearsal.<ref name="Karlin chat" />

The show has featured a number of well-known comedians throughout its run and is notable for boosting the careers of several of these.  [[Scott Dikkers]], editor-in-chief of ''The Onion'', describes it as a key launching pad for comedic talent, saying that "I don't know if there's a better show you could put on your resume right now."<ref>{{cite web|author=Gordon, Devin|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56882|title=Turning Fake News Into Real Careers|work=Newsweek|date=2006-02-13|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref>  Steve Carell, who was a correspondent between 1999 and 2005 before moving on to a movie career and starring television role in ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', credits Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' with his success.<ref>{{cite web|author=Carell, Steve|url=http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=281781179|title=Podcast: Stephen Colbert interviews Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway|work=Apple|date=2008-06-19|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref>  In 2005 the show's longest-serving correspondent, Stephen Colbert, became the host of the spin-off ''Colbert Report'', earning critical and popular acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|author=Coyle, Jake|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2008035067_colbertreport07.html|title=Colbert's "Report" rapport still strong|work=The Seattle Times|date=2008-07-07|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref>

==As a news source==
[[Nielsen Ratings|Television ratings]] show that the program generally has 1.45 to 1.6 million viewers nightly, a high figure for cable television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/01/stewarts_ratings_down_15_colbe.html|title=Jon Stewart's Nielsen Ratings Down 15 Percent; Colbert's Up 11 Percent|publisher=New York Magazine|year=2008|month=January|accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref> In [[demographics|demographic]] terms, the viewership is skewed to a relatively young audience compared to traditional news shows. A 2004 [[Nielsen Media Research]] study commissioned by Comedy Central put the median age at 35. During the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]], the show received more male viewers in the 18-34 year old age demographic than ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', ''[[Meet the Press]]'', ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' and all of the evening news broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/02/apontv.stewarts.stature.ap|title=Young America's news source: Jon Stewart|date=2004-03-02|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=2006-07-22}}</ref> Because of this, commentators such as [[Howard Dean]] posit that Stewart serves as a real source of news for young people, regardless of his intentions.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=114993&title=howard-dean-pt.-2 Howard Dean interview] | episodelink =  | series = The Daily Show | airdate = 2005-06-23 | season = 10 | number = }}</ref>  ''Nightline'' anchor [[Ted Koppel]] has said that "A lot of television viewers&mdash;more, quite frankly, than I'm comfortable with&mdash;get their news from the Comedy Channel on a program called ''The Daily Show''."<ref>{{cite web| author=de Moraes, Lisa|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27439-2004Aug23.html?nav=rss_politics|title=Seriously: Kerry on Comedy Central|date=2004-08-24|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>

The show's writers reject the idea that ''The Daily Show'' has become a source of news for young people.  Stewart argues that Americans are living in an "age of information [[osmosis]]" in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events.  "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense." He argues.  "We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, you would just watch our show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'"<ref>{{cite video  | people = Jon Stewart  | title = A Conversation with Jon Stewart  | medium = Video  | publisher = Harvard University  | location = Harvard Institute of Politics  | year2 = 2002}}</ref>

In late 2004, the National Annenberg Election Survey at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] ran a study of American television viewers and found that fans of ''The Daily Show'' had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] than most others, including those who primarily got their news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers.<ref>National Annenberg Election Survey, ''{{cite web |url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf |title=Daily Show viewers knowledgeable about presidential campaign, National Annenberg Election Survey shows |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050308165738/http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf |archivedate=2005-03-08}}'', press release, September 21, 2004. PDF file.</ref>. However, in a 2004 campaign survey conducted by the Pew Research Center those who cited comedy shows such as ''The Daily Show'' as a source for news were among the least informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates' backgrounds while those who cited the Internet, [[National Public Radio]], and news magazines were the most informed. Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, while those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=200|title=Cable and Internet Loom Large in Fragmented Political News Universe|publisher=Pew| accessdate = 2006-10-24}}</ref>

A more recent survey, released by the Pew Research Center on April 15, 2007, indicates that regular viewers of ''The Daily Show'' tend to be more knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of ''The Daily Show'' viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by [[Jim Lehrer]]'s program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=319|title=Summary of Findings: Public Knowledge of Current Affairs Little Changed by News and Information Revolutions|publisher=Pew| year=2007|month=April| accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref> The [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] released a content analysis report suggesting that ''The Daily Show'' comes close to providing the complete daily news.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eggerton|first=John|title=PEJ: 'The Daily Show' Borders on News Show|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6558923.html?rssid=193|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=2008-05-08|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref>

A 2006 study published by [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] tried to compare the substantive amount of information of ''The Daily Show'' against prime time [[network news]] broadcasts, and concluded that when it comes to substance, there is little difference between ''The Daily Show'' and other news outlets.  The study contended that, since both programs are more focused on the nature of "[[infotainment]]" and ratings than on the dissemination of information, both are broadly "equal" in terms of the amount of substantial news coverage they offer.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fox, Julia R., Koloen, Glory and Sahin, Volkan |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m6836/is_2_51/ai_n25010532|title=No joke: a comparison of substance in The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and broadcast network...|work=Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|date=2007-06-01|accessdate = 2008-08-21}}</ref>

==Criticism==
===Accusations of liberal bias===
Critics, including [[Adam Clymer]], have argued that ''The Daily Show'' has a [[liberal bias]].<ref>{{cite web| author = Wilson, Brad| work = Fox News| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,126226,00.html| title =Late-Night Leaning?| date = 2004-07-20| accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref> Stewart says that while the show does have a more liberal point of view, it is not "a [[American Liberalism|liberal]] organization" with a political agenda and its duty first and foremost is to be funny.  He acknowledges that the show is not necessarily an "equal opportunity offender", explaining that Republicans tended to provide more comedic fodder because "I think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it, not."<ref name="tease">{{cite web| author = Younge, Gary | work = Guardian.co.uk| url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1582009,00.html| title = Such A Tease| accessdate = 2007-04-10}}</ref> In an interview in 2005, when asked how he responded to critics claiming that ''The Daily Show'' is overly liberal, Stephen Colbert said likewise. "We are liberal, but Jon's very respectful of the Republican guests, and, listen, if liberals were in power it would be easier to attack them, but Republicans have the [[President of the United States|executive]], [[United States Congress|legislative]] and [[United States federal courts|judicial]] branches, so making fun of Democrats is like kicking a child, so it's just not worth it."<ref>{{cite web| author = Berkowitz, Elana and Schiller, Amy| work = CampusProgress.org | url = http://www.campusprogress.org/features/375/five-minutes-with-stephen-colbert| title = Five Minutes With: Stephen Colbert| accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref>

Stewart is critical of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politicians for being weak, timid, or ineffective.  He said in an interview with Larry King, prior to the 2006 elections, "I honestly don't feel that [the Democrats] make an impact. They have 49 percent of the vote and three percent of the power. At a certain point you go, 'Guys, pick up your game.'"<ref name="transcripts1">{{cite web|author=King, Larry|url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/27/lkl.01.html|title=Larry King Live Transcript: Interview With Jon Stewart|work = CNN|date=2006-02-27|accessdate = 2008-07-12}}</ref>  He has targeted them for failing to effectively stand on some issues, such as the war in Iraq, describing them as "incompetent" and "unable... to locate their asses, even when presented with two hands and a special ass map."<ref>{{cite web| author=The Daily Show | work = Comedy Central| url = http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=83638&title=withdrawal-method| title = Withdrawal Method | date=2007-03-13 | accessdate = 2008-08-22}}</ref>

Karlin, then the show's [[executive producer]], said in a 2004 interview that while there is a collective sensibility among the staff which, "when filtered through Jon and the correspondents, feels uniform," the principal goal of the show is comedy. "If you have a legitimately funny joke in support of the notion that gay people are an affront to God, we'll put that motherfucker on!" He quipped.<ref>{{cite web| work = Zulkey.com :: Diary| url = http://www.zulkey.com/diary_archive_111904.html| title = "The Ben Karlin Interview: Just Under Twenty Questions"| accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref>

=== Interviews ===
Critics, including [[Tucker Carlson]] and [[Lizz Winstead]], one of ''The Daily Show''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s creators, have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face.  Winstead has expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, "When you are interviewing a [[Richard Perle]] or a [[Henry Kissinger|Kissinger]], if you give them a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary."<ref name="Winstead">{{cite web|url = http://www.motherjones.com/arts/qa/2004/05/04_100.html|title = Taking Back the Dial|work = Mother Jones|date=2004|accessdate = 2008-07-04}}</ref>  She has argued that ''The Daily Show'''s success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show.<ref name="Serious">{{cite web|author=Cave, Damien|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/24/weekinreview/24cave.html|title=Jon Stewart Gets Serious: If You Interview Kissinger, Are You Still a Comedian?|work = New York Times|date=2004-10-24|accessdate = 2008-07-05}}</ref>  Stewart has said that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_stewart.html|title =Transcript: Bill Moyers Interviews Jon Stewart|work = [[NOW with Bill Moyers]]|date=2003-07-11|accessdate = 2008-07-06}}</ref>  

During Stewart's appearance on CNN's [[Crossfire (TV series)|''Crossfire'']], Stewart criticized that show and said that it was "hurting America" by sensationalizing debates and enabling political [[spin (public relations)|spin]]. When co-host Carlson argued that Stewart himself had not asked John Kerry substantial questions when Kerry appeared on ''The Daily Show'', Stewart countered that it was not his job to give hard-hitting interviews and that a "fake news" comedy program should not be held to the same standards as real journalism. "You're on CNN!" Stewart said, "The show that leads into me is [[Crank Yankers|puppets making crank phone calls]]! What is wrong with you?"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html|title = Jon Stewart's America|work = CNN|date=2004-10-15|accessdate = 2008-07-05}}</ref>  Media critic Dan Kennedy says that Stewart came off as disingenuous in this exchange, stating that "you can't interview Bill Clinton, Richard Clarke, Bill O'Reilly, Bob Dole, etc., etc., and still say you're just a comedian."<ref name="Serious">{{cite web|author=Cave, Damien|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/24/weekinreview/24cave.html|title=Jon Stewart Gets Serious: If You Interview Kissinger, Are You Still a Comedian?|work = New York Times|date=2004-10-24|accessdate = 2008-07-05}}</ref>

=== Enabling complacency ===
Critics such as Michael Kalin have expressed concerns that Jon Stewart's comedy comes at the expense of idealism and encourages American college students to adopt a self-righteous attitude toward politics, rendering them complacent and apathetic, and deterring intelligent young people from considering political careers.  "Stewart," Kalin argues, "leads to a 'holier than art thou' attitude [among students]... Content to remain perched atop their Olympian ivory towers, these bright leaders head straight for the private sector."<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/oscars/articles/2006/03/03/why_jon_stewart_isnt_funny/|title = Why Jon Stewart Isn't Funny|work = Boston Globe|last = Kalin|first = Michael|date = [[2006-03-03]]|accessdate = 2006-07-09}}</ref></blockquote>

A 2004 study into the effect of ''The Daily Show'' on viewers' attitudes found that participants had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry after watching Stewart's show.  Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media.<ref>{{cite news|title = Jon Stewart, Enemy of Democracy?|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/22/AR2006062201474.html|last = Morin|first = Richard|publisher = The Washington Post|date = [[2006-06-23]]|accessdate = 2008-07-14}}</ref>  However it is unclear whether the program truly increases cynicism or whether already cynical people are just more drawn to this type of satirical television program.  Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state that it is not clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers.  While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.reflector.com/local/content/news/stories/2006/05/29/5_30_06__daily_show.html|title = Study focuses on the effect of ''The Daily Show'' satire|last = Ryals|first = Jimmy|publisher = [[The Daily Reflector]]|date = [[2006-05-30]]|accessdate = 2006-07-09}}</ref>  Rachel Larris, who has also conducted an academic study of ''The Daily Show'', disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, and that it would be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing ''The Daily Show'' and thinking or acting in a particular way.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/05/24/the_daily_show_cause_and_effect.php|last = Larris|first = Rachel Joy|publisher = TomPaine.com|title = "The Daily Show" Cause And Effect|date = [[2006-06-24]]|accessdate = 2008-08-12}}</ref>  Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of [[The Huffington Post]] argue that it is not Stewart's fault if viewers are cynical, but that of the political and media figures he satirizes.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/27/blogophile/main1754241.shtml|last = McNamara|first = Melissa|publisher = [[CBS News]]|title = Bloggers Laugh Over Jon Stewart Study|date = [[2006-06-28]]|accessdate = 2006-07-09}}</ref>

Stewart himself says that he does not perceive his show as cynical.  "It's so interesting to me that people talk about late-night comedy being cynical," he says. "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it 'fair and balanced'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism."<ref>{{cite news

"We're not the guys at the craps table betting against the line," he said on ''[[Larry King Live]]''.  "If government suddenly became inspiring... we would be the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots like, you know, media people, no offense."<ref name="transcripts1"/>

== Editions for various markets ==
[[Image:TDSglobal.png|thumb|The disclaimer displayed at the beginning of ''The Daily Show: Global Edition'']]
<!-- Please don't list broadcast details (ie. times, days and channels) specific to your country or region in this section. -->
''The Daily Show'' airs on various networks worldwide; in addition, an edited version of the show called ''The Daily Show &ndash; Global Edition'' was devised specifically for overseas networks in late 2002.  The ''Global Edition'' has been run outside of the U.S. on CNN International once a week on several weekend time slots. This edition runs for half an hour and contains a selection of segments including one guest interview from the preceding week's shows, usually from the Monday and Tuesday episodes.  Stewart provides an exclusive introductory monologue in front of an audience, usually about the week's prevalent international news story, and closing comments without an audience present.<ref name="global">{{cite news

Its stories are not fact checked. Its reporters are not journalists. And its opinions are not fully thought through."  Between 2001 and 2006, [[Westwood One]] broadcast small, 90-second portions of the show to many radio stations across America.<ref>{{cite news

== Spin-offs ==
{{main|The Colbert Report}}
A spin-off, ''The Colbert Report'', was announced in early May 2005. The show stars former correspondent Stephen Colbert, and serves as Comedy Central's answer to the programs of media pundits such as Bill O'Reilly. Colbert, Stewart, and Ben Karlin developed the idea for the show based on a series of faux-television commercials that had been created for an earlier ''Daily Show'' segment.  They pitched the concept to Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog, who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without first creating a pilot.<ref name="TCR">{{cite news

Initial ratings satisfied Comedy Central and less than three weeks after its debut the show was renewed for a year.<ref>{{cite news

Comedy Central announced in October 2007 that it had picked up another series from Busboy.  ''[[Important Things with Demetri Martin]]'' features the ''Daily Show'' contributor but is not a spin-off.<ref>{{cite news
