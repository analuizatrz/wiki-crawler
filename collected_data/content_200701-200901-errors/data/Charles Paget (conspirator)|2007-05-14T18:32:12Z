'''Charles Paget''' (''c.'' [[1546]]&ndash;[[1612]]) was a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] conspirator, involved in the [[Babington plot]] to [[assassination|assassinate]] [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] of [[England]].

Born around 1546, Charles Paget was the younger son of the English statesman [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|William Paget, the first Baron Paget]] and his wife, Anne. He studied at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], but left without taking a degree. Around 1581, he went to France, to avoid the [[religious persecution]] in England.

In 1586, [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary, Queen of Scots]] was accused by the British Government of having received and written letters about a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth. Paget was named in Mary's trial as one of the correspondents, and a letter to him dated [[17 July]] [[1586]] formed part of the evidence at her trial. Queen Elizabeth demanded Paget's extradition from France, and threatened to have him assassinated if he remained.

Early in 1588, Paget moved to Brussels, where he remained for the next eleven years before returning to Paris. After the death of Queen Elizabeth, it was safe for him to return to England, and he returned on 13 July 1603. He died at the beginning of February 1612.<ref name=Holmes>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21103?docPos=2 Peter Holmes: "Charles Paget"] in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''.</ref>
