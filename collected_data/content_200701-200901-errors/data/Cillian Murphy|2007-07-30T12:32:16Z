==Biography==
===Early life===
Murphy was born in [[Douglas, County Cork|Douglas]], [[County Cork]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref name="Premiere 2005 best">Lytal, Cristy.

"Western Hero", ''RTÉ Guide'', [[6 February]] [[2004]].</ref>

Murphy attended the Catholic school [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork]]. He did well in school, although he was not keen on sport, which was a major part of life at PBC.<ref name="Independent action hero">Walsh, John. [http://arts.independent.co.uk/film/features/article2405029.ece "Murphy's lore: Meet the action hero who looks on the verge of tears"], ''The Independent'', [[31 March]] [[2007]]. Accessed [[18 July]] [[2007]].</ref> But it was there that Murphy got his first taste of performing, when at 16, he attended a drama module presented by Pat Kiernan, the director of the [[Corcadorca Theatre Company]]. Murphy later described the experience as a "huge high" and a "fully alive" feeling that he set out to chase.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham">Jackson, Joe. "From Cork to Gotham", ''Sunday Independent Life Magazine'', [[8 February]] [[2004]].</ref> But at this stage, performing meant dreams of becoming a rock star.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004">O'Donoghue, Donal. "Western Hero", ''RTÉ Guide'', [[6 February]] [[2004]].</ref>

===From music to acting===
Originally, Murphy worked toward a career as a [[rock musician]], playing guitar in several bands alongside his brother in his late teens.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004">O'Donoghue, Donal. "Western Hero", ''RTÉ Guide'', [[6 February]] [[2004]].</ref> Then, in 1996, their band The Sons of Mr. Greengenes, a [[Frank Zappa]]-influenced outfit that took its name from a [[Hot Rats|1969 Zappa song]], was offered a record deal. They did not sign the contract, partly because Pádraig was still in secondary school, so their parents did not approve, and partly because the contract offered little money and would have ceded the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham">Jackson, Joe. "From Cork to Gotham", ''Sunday Independent Life Magazine'', [[8 February]] [[2004]].</ref>

By then, Murphy was studying [[law]] at [[University College Cork]] (UCC), but flunked his first year exams because his heart wasn't in it.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham">Jackson, Joe. "From Cork to Gotham", ''Sunday Independent Life Magazine'', [[8 February]] [[2004]].</ref> Not only was he busy with his band,<ref name="RTE Guide 2004">O'Donoghue, Donal. "Western Hero", ''RTÉ Guide'', [[6 February]] [[2004]].</ref> but he had known within days after starting at UCC that law was the wrong fit for his artistic personality.<ref name="Electric Mail">Clayton-Lea, Tony.

Accessed [[24 July]] [[2007]].</ref> Also, after seeing a stage production of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', acting had begun to pique his interest.<ref name="LAT pale blue eyes">Abramowitz, Rachel.

Accessed [[10 March]] [[2007]].</ref> His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society production of ''[[Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme]]'', but, according to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women rather than to start an acting career.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004">O'Donoghue, Donal. "Western Hero", ''RTÉ Guide'', [[6 February]] [[2004]].</ref> Nonetheless, his transition from music to acting had begun, about which he later remarked, {{cquote|''I think there's such a thing as a performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there.

===Acting career===
In September 1996, Murphy landed his first professional role on the stage, originating the part of antisocial teenager "Pig" in [[Enda Walsh]]'s ''[[Disco Pigs]]'', directed by Pat Kiernan for Corcadorca.<ref name="RTE interview">Guerin, Harry.

Accessed [[18 July]] [[2007]].</ref> He later reprised his ''Disco Pigs'' role for the 2001 independent film version by [[Kirsten Sheridan]]. The closing credits feature Murphy performing his original song "So New", and he sings [[The Kinks]]' "[[You Really Got Me]]" in a [[pub]] [[karaoke]] scene.<ref name="So New">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236157/soundtrack Soundtracks for ''Disco Pigs''] IMDb.</ref>

From 1997 to 2002, Murphy starred in independent feature films, [[Short film|shorts]], plays and in the BBC miniseries adaptation of ''[[The Way We Live Now]]'', but it was not until director [[Danny Boyle]]'s ''[[28 Days Later]]'' became a [[sleeper hit]] in [[United States of America|America]] in 2003, that he came to the attention of a wider audience. His performance as pandemic survivor Jim earned him nominations for Best Newcomer at the 2003 [[Empire Awards]] and Breakthrough Male Performance at the [[2004 MTV Movie Awards]], among others.<ref name="IMDb awards">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/awards Cillian Murphy - Awards], IMDb.</ref> ''ComingSoon.net''&#39;s rave review of the film said, "Cillian Murphy is a superb find... and he gives a breakout performance as a man torn apart by the new world into which he's awakened."<ref name="ComingSoon 28DL">Douglas, Edward.

In late 2003, Murphy starred as a lovelorn, hapless supermarket stocker who plots a bank heist with [[Colin Farrell]] in ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'', which became the highest-grossing Irish [[independent film]] in Irish box office history (until ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'' broke the record in 2006).<ref name="RTE press watch">[http://www.rte.ie/business/2006/0808/presswatch.html "Loach Film Sets New Money Mark"], RTE.ie, [[8 August]] [[2006]].

For the latter film, he learned to chop meat in an abattoir to prepare for his role as a butcher, even though he is a vegetarian.<ref name="Irish Tatler">Crewe, Charity.

[[Image:RedEye05.jpg|left|thumb|Cillian as Jackson Rippner in ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]'' with [[Rachel McAdams]]]]

2005 was the year that Murphy won wider recognition for two high-profile villain roles, as Dr. Jonathan Crane/[[supervillain]] [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] in ''[[Batman Begins]]'', and  as Jackson Rippner in the thriller ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. He originally auditioned for the role of [[Batman]] in ''Batman Begins''. Though the part was given to [[Christian Bale]], director [[Christopher Nolan]] was reportedly very impressed with Murphy's audition and persuaded him to take the role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, whose alter ego is the villain [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]]. In [[Wes Craven]]'s critical<ref name="Red Eye reviews">[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_eye/ ''Red Eye''] Rotten Tomatoes.</ref> and box office smash<ref name="Red Eye biz">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421239/business Box office information for ''Red Eye''] IMDb.</ref> ''Red Eye'', Murphy played an operative in an assassination plot who terrorizes [[Rachel McAdams]] on an overnight flight. Film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] raved that Murphy made "a picture-perfect villain" and that his "baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors."<ref name="Dargis">Dargis, Manohla.

In late 2005 (early 2006 in Europe), Murphy starred as Patrick "Kitten" Braden, a [[transgendered]] Irish orphan in search of his mother, in [[Neil Jordan]]'s [[dramedy]] ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Patrick McCabe]]. Murphy auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, ''[[The Crying Game]]'' director was hesitant to revisit transgender and [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] issues. For several years, Murphy lobbied Jordan to make the film before the actor became too old to play the part. In 2004, Murphy prepared for the role by meeting with a [[transvestite]] who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. Taking notice of the group's quick wit, Murphy attributed it to their constantly having to respond to insults from prejudiced people around them.<ref name="TONY 2005">Kaufman, Anthony.

Against ''Breakfast on Pluto''&#39;s kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s [[glitter rock]] fashion, magic shows, red light districts and IRA violence, Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to high [[drag (clothing)|drag]] [[blond bombshell]]. ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Ruthe Stein said of his performance, {{cquote|''Murphy projects enormous energy onscreen, as he's already shown in ''28 Days Later...'' and ''Red Eye''. He's supremely well cast as the androgynous Kitten. ...Murphy smoothly makes the transition from broad comedy to drama.
