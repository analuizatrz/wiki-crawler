==Career==
===Youth and early career (1957-1993)===

He was born at [[Sandwell General Hospital]], and grew up at 189 Bristnall Hall Road, a council house in neighbouring [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]]. He was the youngest of four children born to [[West Cornforth|West Cornforth-born]] former semi-professional footballer John Collins and his wife Doris. He has two older brothers, Keith and Terry, as well as an older sister called Norah. His father had played for [[Spennymoor United F.C.|Spennymoor United]] before the [[Second World War]], and met his mother in a local pub after Spennymoor had played [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in an [[FA Cup]] game in 1937. He attended Moat Farm Infant School from 1961 to 1964, St. Hubert's Roman Catholic Junior School from 1964 to 1968, and then [[Warley High School|Oldbury Technical Secondary School]] from September 1968.

He passed 2 [[O-level]]s in the summer of 1973 and was allowed to take [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] in English Language and Art, along with several O-level re-sits, at Oldbury Technical School Sixth Form. He took 4 A-levels (including English Language and Literature) at [[Warley College of Technology]] and then graduated from Birmingham Polytechnic (now [[Birmingham City University]]) in 1981 with a degree in English. This was followed by a Masters degree in English Literature at the [[University of Warwick]], the following year. After graduating, he spent four years as a lecturer in English at [[Halesowen College]], whilst being a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] on the side, before quitting his job in 1989 to pursue his comedy career full-time. During this period a bout of [[influenza]] made him give up drinking, and remains one of the UK's most high-profile recovering [[alcoholic]]s.

Collins took on the pseudonym '''Frank Skinner''' when the actors' union [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] told him there was already someone of the same name on their books (their rules do not permit two members with identical names). He took the name from a member of his late father's [[dominoes]] team. Skinner had performed his first stand-up gig in 1987 and made his [[television]] debut a year later. In 1990 he co-wrote and starred in a weakly-received [[sitcom]], ''[[Packet of Three (TV series)|Packet Of Three]]'', on [[Channel 4]] but continued to see his reputation as a stand-up grow. He won the 1991 [[Perrier Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], beating [[Jack Dee]] and [[Eddie Izzard]].

===Career peak (1994-2005)===
He often works with best friend and ex-flatmate [[David Baddiel]], notably on the popular late night entertainment show ''[[Fantasy Football League]]'', from 1994 to 2004 and on ''[[Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned]]'' from 2000 to 2005.

The duo also co-wrote and performed the [[soccer|football]] song "[[Three Lions]]" with the [[Lightning Seeds]] and the [[England national football team]] for [[Euro 96]], and re-released it for the [[1998 World Cup]]. Both times the song reached #1 in the UK charts and it is widely regarded as the best of the English football anthems{{Fact|date=November 2007}}. In 2001, he released his [[autobiography]] "Frank Skinner by Frank Skinner", which became an instant bestseller. An accompanying TV show, "Frank Skinner on Frank Skinner", in which Skinner showed where he lived as a child and interviews with Skinner, his friends and family members, was recorded and shown on [[ITV]] in 2001. From 1995 to 1998, Skinner had his own chat show on [[BBC]] One, and moved it to [[ITV]] in 1999, where it ran until late 2005. He has appeared in a number of self-written sitcoms, including ''[[Blue Heaven]]'' (1994) and ''[[Shane (UK TV series)|Shane]]'' (2004). In 2003, he was listed in [[The Observer]] as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. He has lived in London since 1991, but still supports [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]]<ref>{{cite web

===Post ITV (2006-present)===

In 2005, Skinner announced he was going to leave behind his television work in favour of returning to the stand-up comedy circuit. A second series of ''Shane'' has been made, but not shown. In February 2006, he received an [[honorary degree]] from [[Birmingham City University]].<ref>{{Citation

The podcasts received a nomination for the 2007 Sony Radio Academy Awards. In May 2006, he appeared as a guest speaker at the [[Oxford Union]]. Skinner learned to play the banjo for a celebrity reality show, [[Play It Again#2: Frank Skinner.2C playing the banjo.|Play It Again]], which was broadcast on the BBC in March 2007. He had 3 months to learn the instrument before competing in a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] festival. Unfortunately for Frank, when it came to the festival, nerves got the better of him and he played very poorly.

In 2007, he announced a new live stand-up tour, his first for 10 years. On 1 May he performed a warm-up gig before a sell-out crowd at the [[Swindon]] [http://www.swindon.gov.uk/artscentre Arts Centre], and followed this up on 26 May at the 150 capacity Forest Arts, [[New Milton]]. His final preview performance was at the Junction Theatre, [[Cambridge]] on 29 July. In August Frank returned to the Edinburgh Festival for 2 weeks at The Pleasance, the venue where he won the [[Perrier Award]].

In the Autumn Frank returned to the live circuit performing a 69 date national tour including three sold out homecoming performances at the [[National Indoor Arena]] in Birmingham which were recorded for a forthcoming DVD.

Skinner returned to ITV to take part in a new show, ''[http://www.itv.com/entertainment/comedy/toughgig/frankskinner Tough Gig]'', which [http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=1824734606694166109&hl=en-GB aired] on Tuesday 12 June 2007 at 10pm, chronicling his visit to an [[Osho]] commune in Dorset.

He is also producing a [[CBS]] pilot version of ''Shane''.<ref>http://www.sitcom.co.uk/news/news.php?story=00097</ref>

In November 2008 and in the light of senior broadcasting figures such as ITV boss [[Michael Grade]] and Sir [[Terry Wogan]] calling for TV to clean up its act regarding use of swear words, Skinner decided to experiment with removing swear words altogether from his stand up live act although stated that it would be a shame if 'clever swearing' was lost.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7732000/7732899.stm</ref> He also stood in for an ill [[Paul Merton]] as a team captain on the November 21 edition of ''[[Have I Got News For You]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a136261/merton-misses-have-i-got-news-with-illness.html|title=Merton misses 'Have I Got News' with illness|author=Alex Fletcher|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2008-11-21|date=2008-11-21}}</ref>

He revealed on 28 November 2008 on the BBC political show ''[[This Week (BBC One TV series)|''This Week]]'' that he earns £150,000 a year.
