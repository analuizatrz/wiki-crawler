{{redirect|Exponent}}
'''Exponentiation''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]], written '''''a''<sup>''n''</sup>''', involving two numbers, the '''[[base (mathematics)|base]]''' ''a'' and the '''exponent''' ''n''. When ''n'' is a [[Positive number|positive]] [[integer]], exponentiation corresponds to repeated [[multiplication]]:

:<math>a^n = \underbrace{a \times \cdots \times a}_n,</math>

just as multiplication by a positive integer corresponds to repeated [[addition]]:

:<math>a \times n = \underbrace{a + \cdots + a}_n.</math>
The exponent is usually shown as a [[superscript]] to the right of the base. The exponentiation ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> can be read as: ''a raised to the n-th power'', ''a raised to the power [of] n'' or possibly ''a raised to the exponent [of] n'', or more briefly: ''a to the n-th power'' or ''a to the power [of] n'', or even more briefly: ''a to the n''. Some exponents have their own pronunciation: for example, ''a''<sup>2</sup> is usually read as ''a squared'' and ''a''<sup>3</sup> as ''a cubed''.

The power ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> can be defined also when ''n'' is a negative integer, at least for nonzero ''a''. 
No natural extension to all real ''a'' and ''n'' exists,
but when the base ''a'' is a positive real number, ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> can be defined for all real and even complex exponents ''n'' via the [[exponential function]] ''e''<sup>''z''</sup>.  [[trigonometry|Trigonometric functions]] can be expressed in terms of complex exponentiation.

Exponentiation where the exponent is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is used for solving systems of [[linear differential equation]]s.

Exponentiation is used pervasively in many other fields as well, including economics, biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science, with applications such as  [[compound interest]], [[population growth]], chemical [[reaction kinetics]], [[wave]] behavior, and [[public key cryptography]].

[[Image:Expo02.svg|thumb|315px|Exponentiation with various bases; from top to bottom, [[#Powers of ten|base 10]] (<span style="color:green">green</span>), [[#Powers of e|base ''e'']] (<span style="color:red">red</span>), [[#Powers of two|base 2]] (<span style="color:blue">blue</span>), base ½ (<span style="color:cyan">cyan</span>).  Note how all of the curves pass through the point (0,&nbsp;1). This is because, in accordance with [[Exponentiation#Exponents one and zero|the properties of exponentiation]], any nonzero number raised to the power 0 is 1. Also note that at x=1, the y value equals the base. This is because any number raised to the power 1 is that same number.]]

==Exponentiation with integer exponents==
The exponentiation operation with integer exponents requires only [[elementary algebra]].

===Positive integer exponents===
The expression ''a''<sup>2</sup> = ''a''·''a'' is called the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of ''a'' because the area of a square with side-length ''a'' is ''a''<sup>2</sup>.

The expression
''a''<sup>3</sup> = ''a''·''a''·''a''  is called the [[Cube (arithmetics)|cube]], because the volume of a cube with side-length ''a'' is ''a''<sup>3</sup>. 

So 3<sup>2</sup> is pronounced "three squared", and 2<sup>3</sup> is "two cubed".

The exponent says how many copies of the base are multiplied together. For example, 3<sup>5</sup> = 3·3·3·3·3 = 243. The base 3 appears 5 times in the repeated multiplication, because the exponent is 5.
Here, 3 is the ''base'', 5 is the ''exponent'', and 243 is the ''power'' or, more specifically, ''the fifth power of 3'', ''3 raised to the fifth power'', or ''3 to the power of 5''.

The word "raised" is usually omitted, and very often "power" as well, so 3<sup>5</sup> is typically pronounced "three to the fifth" or "three to the five".

Formally, powers with positive integer exponents may be defined by the initial condition   ''a''<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''  and the [[recurrence relation]]   ''a''<sup>''n''+1</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''·''a''<sup>''n''</sup>.

===Exponents one and zero===
Notice that 3<sup>1</sup> is the product of only one 3, which is evidently 3.

Also note that 3<sup>5</sup> = 3·3<sup>4</sup>. Also 3<sup>4</sup> = 3·3<sup>3</sup>. Continuing this trend, we should have
:3<sup>1</sup> = 3·3<sup>0</sup>.
Another way of saying this is that when ''n'', ''m'', and ''n'' − ''m'' are positive (and if ''x'' is not equal to zero), one can see by counting the number of occurrences of ''x'' that
:<math> \frac{x^n}{x^m} = x^{n - m}.</math>
Extended to the case that ''n'' and ''m'' are equal, the equation would read
:<math> 1 = \frac{x^n}{x^n} = x^{n - n} = x^0 </math>
since both the numerator and the denominator are equal.  Therefore we take this as the definition of ''x''<sup>0</sup>.

Therefore we '''define''' 3<sup>0</sup> = 1 so that the above equality holds. This leads to the following rule:
*Any number to the power 1 is itself.
*Any nonzero number to the power 0 is 1; one interpretation of these powers is as [[empty product]]s. The case of 0<sup>0</sup> is discussed [[#Zero to the zero power|below]].

===[[Combinatorics|Combinatorial]] interpretation===

For nonnegative integers ''n'' and ''m'', the power ''n''<sup>''m''</sup> equals the [[cardinality]] of the set of ''m''-[[tuple]]s from an ''n''-element [[Set (mathematics)|set]], or the number of ''m''-letter words from an ''n''-letter alphabet.

:0<sup>5</sup> = | {} | = 0. There is no 5-tuple from the empty set. 
:1<sup>4</sup> = | { (1,1,1,1) } | = 1. There is one 4-tuple from a one-element set.
:2<sup>3</sup> = | { (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (2,1,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), (2,2,2) } | = 8. There are eight 3-tuples from a two-element set.
:3<sup>2</sup> = | { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) } | = 9. There are nine 2-tuples from a three-element set.
:4<sup>1</sup> = | { (1), (2), (3), (4) } | = 4. There are four 1-tuples from a four-element set.
:5<sup>0</sup> = | { () } | = 1. There is exactly one empty [[tuple]].

See also '''[[Exponentiation#Exponentiation over sets|exponentiation over sets]]'''.

===Negative integer exponents===
By definition, raising a nonzero number to the &minus;1 power produces its [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]:
:<math>a^{-1} = \frac{1}{a}.</math>

One also defines
:<math>a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}</math>
for any nonzero ''a'' and any positive integer ''n''.  Raising 0 to a negative power would imply [[Division by zero|division by 0]], so it is left undefined.

The definition of ''a''<sup>−''n''</sup> for nonzero ''a'' is made so that the identity ''a''<sup>''m''</sup>''a''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''<sup>''m+n''</sup>, initially true only for nonnegative integers ''m'' and ''n'', holds for ''arbitrary'' integers ''m'' and ''n''.  In particular, requiring this identity for ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''−n'' is requiring
:<math>a^{-n} \, a^{n} = a^{-n\,+\,n} = a^0 = 1,</math>
where ''a''<sup>0</sup> is defined above, and this motivates the definition ''a''<sup>−''n''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>''a''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> shown above.

Exponentiation to a negative integer power can alternatively be seen as repeated [[division (mathematics)|division]] of 1 by the base.
For instance, 
:<math>3^{-4} = (((1/3)/3)/3)/3 = \frac{1}{81} = \frac{1}{3^{4}}</math>.

===Identities and properties===
The most important [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] satisfied by integer exponentiation is
:<math> a^{m + n} = a^m \cdot a^n. </math>
This identity has the consequence
:<math>a^{m - n} =\frac{a^m}{a^n}</math>
for ''a'' ≠ 0, and
:<math>(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}.</math>
Another basic identity is
:<math>(a \cdot b)^n = a^n \cdot b^n.</math>

While addition and multiplication are [[commutative]] (for example,
2+3 = 5 = 3+2 and
2·3 = 6 = 3·2), exponentiation is not commutative:
2<sup>3</sup> = 8, but 3<sup>2</sup> = 9.

Similarly, while addition and multiplication are [[associative]] (for example,
(2+3)+4 = 9 = 2+(3+4) and
(2·3)·4 = 24 = 2·(3·4), exponentiation is not associative either:
2<sup>3</sup> to the 4th power is 8<sup>4</sup> or 4096, but 2 to the 3<sup>4</sup> power is
2<sup>81</sup> or 2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352. Without parentheses to modify the order of calculation, the order is usually understood to be top-down, not bottom-up:
:<math>a^{b^c}=a^{(b^c)}\ne (a^b)^c=a^{(b\cdot c)}=a^{b\cdot c}.</math>

===Powers of ten===
:''See [[Scientific notation]]''
In the base ten ([[decimal]]) number system, integer powers of 10 are written as the digit 1 followed or preceded by a number of zeroes determined by the sign and magnitude of the exponent.  For example, 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000 and 10<sup>&minus;4</sup> = 0.0001.

Exponentiation with base [[10 (number)|10]] is used in [[scientific notation]] to describe large or small numbers. For instance, 299,792,458 (the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, in meters per second) can be written as 2.99792458·10<sup>8</sup> and then [[approximation|approximated]] as 2.998·10<sup>8</sup>.

[[SI prefix]]es based on powers of 10 are also used to describe small or large quantities. For example, the prefix [[Kilo-|kilo]] means 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000, so a kilometre is 1000 [[metre]]s.

===Powers of two===
The positive [[Power of two|powers of 2]] are important in [[computer science]] because there are 2<sup>''n''</sup> possible values for an ''n''-[[bit]] [[variable]]. See [[Binary numeral system]].  

Powers of 2 are important in [[set theory]] since a set with ''n'' members has a [[power set]], or set of all [[subset]]s of the original set, with 2<sup>''n''</sup> members.

The negative powers of 2 are commonly used, and the first two have special names: [[One half|half]], and [[quarter]].

In the base 2 (binary) number system, integer powers of 2 are written as 1 followed or preceded by a number of zeroes determined by the sign and magnitude of the exponent. For example, two to the power of three is written 1000 in binary.

===Powers of one===
The integer powers of one are one: 1<sup>''n''</sup> = 1.

===Powers of zero===
If the exponent is positive, the power of zero is zero: 0<sup>''n''</sup> = 0, where ''n'' > 0.

If the exponent is negative, the power of zero (0<sup>''n''</sup>, where ''n'' < 0) is undefined, because division by zero is implied.

If the exponent is zero, some authors define 0<sup>0</sup>=1, whereas others leave it undefined, as discussed [[#Zero to the zero power|below]].

===Powers of minus one===

If ''n'' is an even integer, then (&minus;1)<sup>''n''</sup> = 1.

If ''n'' is an odd integer, then (&minus;1)<sup>''n''</sup> = &minus;1.

Because of this, powers of &minus;1 are useful for expressing alternating sequences.  For a similar discussion of powers of the complex number ''i'', see the section on [[exponentiation#Powers of the imaginary unit|powers of the imaginary unit]].

===Large exponents===
The [[limit of a sequence]] of powers of a number greater than one diverges, in other words they grow without bound:
:''a''<sup>''n''</sup> &rarr; &infin; as ''n'' &rarr; &infin; when ''a'' > 1 .
This can be read as "''a'' to the power of ''n'' tends to [[infinity]] as ''n'' tends to infinity when ''a'' is greater than one".

Powers of a number with [[absolute value]] less that one tend to zero:
:''a''<sup>''n''</sup> &rarr; 0 as ''n'' &rarr; &infin; when |''a''| < 1 .
Powers of one, are one:
:''a''<sup>''n''</sup> &rarr; 1 as ''n'' &rarr; &infin; when ''a'' = 1 .

If the number ''a'' varies tending to 1 as the exponent tends to infinity then the limit is not necessarily one of those above. A particularly important case is 
:(1+''n''<sup>&minus;1</sup>)<sup>''n''</sup> &rarr; ''e'' as ''n''&rarr;&infin; 
see the section below [[#Powers of e|Powers of e]].

Other limits, in particular of those tending to [[indeterminate forms]], are described in [[#Limits of powers|limits of powers]] below.

==Real powers of positive real numbers==

Raising a positive real number to a power that is not an integer can be accomplished in two ways.
*[[Rational number]] exponents can be defined in terms of  [[Nth root|''n''<sup>th</sup> root]]s, and arbitrary nonzero exponents can then be defined by continuity. <!-- This method is perhaps the one most widely taught in schools.  This needs a source to be reinserted -->
*The [[natural logarithm]] can be used to define real exponents using the exponential function.

The [[#Identities and properties|identities and properties]] shown above are true for noninteger exponents as well. 

===Principal ''n''-th root===

[[Image:Root graphs.svg|right|thumb|300px|From top to bottom: ''x''<sup>1/8</sup>, ''x''<sup>1/4</sup>, ''x''<sup>1/2</sup>, ''x''<sup>1</sup>, ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ''x''<sup>4</sup>, ''x''<sup>8</sup>.]]

{{Main|n-th root}}

An ''' ''n''-th root''' of a [[number]] ''a'' is a number ''x'' such that ''x<sup>n</sup>'' = ''a''.  

If ''a'' is a positive real number and ''n'' is a positive integer, then there is exactly one positive real solution to ''x<sup>n</sup>'' = ''a''.
This solution is called the principal [[Nth root|''n''-th root]] of ''a''.
It is denoted <sup>''n''</sup>√<span style="text-decoration:overline">''a''</span>,
where √<span style="text-decoration:overline">&ensp;</span> is the '''radical''' [[symbol]]; alternatively, it may be written <math>a^{1/n}</math>.
For example: 4<sup>1/2</sup> = 2, 8<sup>1/3</sup> = 2, 

When one speaks of ''the'' ''n''-th root of a positive [[real number]] ''a'', one means the '''principal ''n''-th root'''.

===Rational powers ===

A power with a [[rational number|rational]] exponent ''m''/''n'' in lowest terms satisfies

:<math>a^{m/n} = \left(a^m\right)^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}</math>

whenever this makes sense.

===Powers of e===

{{main|Exponential function}}

The important mathematical constant [[E (mathematical constant)|''e'']], sometimes called [[Euler's number]], is approximately equal to 2.718 and is the base of the [[natural logarithm]].  It provides a path for defining exponentiation with noninteger exponents. It is defined as the following limit where the power goes to infinity as the base tends to one: 
:<math>e =\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac 1 n \right)^n  .</math>

The '''[[exponential function]]''', defined by 
:<math>e^x =\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac x n \right)^n  ,</math>
has the ''x'' written as a power as it satisfies the basic exponential identity
:<math>e^{x+y} = e^{x} \cdot e^{y} .</math>
The exponential function is defined for all integer, fractional, real, and [[complex number|complex]] values of ''x''. It can even be used to extend exponentiation to some nonnumerical entities e.g. [[square matrix|square matrices]], however the exponential identity only holds when ''x'' and ''y'' commute.

A short proof that ''e'' to a positive integer power ''k'' is the same as ''e''<sup>''k''</sup> is:
:<math>(e)^k = \left(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac{1}{n} \right) ^n\right)^k = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\left(1+\frac{1}{n} \right) ^n\right)^k = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac k {n\cdot k} \right)^{n \cdot k}</math>
:<math> = \lim_{n \cdot k \rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac k {n\cdot k} \right)^{n \cdot k} = \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac k m \right)^m = e^k .  </math>

This proof shows also that ''e''<sup>''x''+''y''</sup> satisfies the exponential identity when ''x'' and ''y'' are positive integers. These results are in fact generally true for all numbers, not just for the positive integers.

===Real powers ===

Since any [[real number]] can be approximated by rational numbers, exponentiation to an arbitrary real exponent ''x'' can be defined by [[continuous function|continuity]] with the rule
 
:<math> b^x = \lim_{r \to x} b^r,</math>
where the limit as ''r'' gets close to ''x'' is taken only over rational values of ''r''.

For example, if 
:<math>x  \approx 1.732 </math>
then 
:<math>5^x  \approx 5^{1.732} =5^{433/250}=\sqrt[250]{5^{433}} \approx 16.241 .</math>

Exponentiation by a real power is normally accomplished using logarithms instead of using limits of rational powers.

The [[natural logarithm]] ln(''x'') is the [[inverse function|inverse]] of the exponential function ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>.
It is defined for <math>b>0</math>, and satisfies 
:<math>b = e^{\ln b}.\,</math>
If ''b''<sup>''x''</sup> is to be defined to as to preserve the logarithm and exponent rules,
then one must have
:<math>b^x = (e^{\ln b})^x = e^{x \cdot\ln b}.\,</math>
This motivates the ''definition''
:<math>b^x = e^{x\cdot\ln b}\,</math>
for each real number ''x''.

This definition of the real number power ''b''<sup>''x''</sup> agrees with the definition given above using rational exponents and continuity.  The definition of exponentiation using logarithms is more common in the context of complex numbers, as discussed below.

==Powers of negative real numbers==

If ''a'' is negative and ''n'' is [[Parity (mathematics)|even]], then ''x<sup>n</sup>'' = ''a'' has no real solutions,
If ''a'' is negative and ''n'' is [[Parity (mathematics)|odd]], then ''x<sup>n</sup>'' = ''a'' has one negative solution.

Neither the logarithm method nor the rational exponent method can be used to define ''a''<sup>''k''</sup> as a real number for a negative real number ''a'' and an arbitrary real number ''k''. In some special cases, a definition is possible: integral powers of negative real numbers are real numbers, and rational powers of the form ''a''<sup>''m''/''n''</sup> where ''n'' is odd can be computed using roots. But since there is no real number ''x'' such that ''x''<sup>2</sup> = &minus;1, the definition of ''a''<sup>''m''/''n''</sup> when ''n'' is even and ''m'' is odd must use the [[imaginary unit]] ''i'', as described more fully in the next section.

The logarithm method cannot be used to define ''a''<sup>''k''</sup> as a real number when ''a'' ≤ 0: indeed, ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> is positive for every real number ''x'', so ln(''a'') is not defined as a real number.  (On the other hand, arbitrary [[Exponentiation#Powers of complex numbers|complex powers]] of negative numbers ''a'' can be defined by choosing a [[complex logarithm|''complex'' logarithm]] of ''a''.)

The rational exponent method cannot be used for negative values of ''a'' because it relies on [[continuous function|continuity]]. The function ''f''(''r'') = ''a''<sup>''r''</sup> has a unique continuous extension from the rational numbers to the real numbers for each ''a'' > 0.  But when ''a'' < 0, the function ''f'' is not even continuous on the set of rational numbers ''r'' for which it is defined. 

For example, take ''a'' = &minus;1. The ''n''<sup>th</sup> root of &minus;1 
is &minus;1 for every odd natural number ''n''. So if ''n'' is an odd positive integer, (&minus;1)<sup>(''m''/''n'')</sup> = &minus;1 if ''m'' is odd, and (&minus;1)<sup>(''m''/''n'')</sup> = 1 if ''m'' is even.  Thus the set of rational numbers ''q'' for which &minus;1<sup>''q''</sup> = 1 is [[dense set|dense]] in the rational numbers, as is the set of ''q'' for which &minus;1<sup>''q''</sup> = &minus;1. This means that the function (&minus;1)<sup>''q''</sup> is not continuous at any rational number ''q'' where it is defined.

==Complex powers of positive real numbers==

===Imaginary powers of e===
{{main|Exponential function}}

[[Image:ExpIPi.gif|300px|thumb|right|The [[exponential function]] ''e''<sup>''z''</sup> can be defined as the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of {{nowrap|(1 + ''z''/''N'')<sup>''N''</sup>}}, as ''N'' approaches infinity, and thus ''e''<sup>''iπ''</sup> is the limit of {{nowrap|(1 + ''iπ''/''N'')<sup>''N''</sup>}}. In this animation ''N'' takes various increasing values from 1 to 100. The computation of {{nowrap|(1 + ''iπ''/''N'')<sup>''N''</sup>}} is displayed as the combined effect of ''N'' repeated multiplications in the [[complex plane]], with the final point being the actual value of {{nowrap|(1 + ''iπ''/''N'')<sup>''N''</sup>}}. It can be seen that as ''N'' gets larger {{nowrap|(1 + ''iπ''/''N'')<sup>''N''</sup>}} approaches a limit of &minus;1. Therefore, {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>''iπ''</sup> = &minus;1,}} which is known as [[Euler's identity]].]]

The [[Complex number#Geometric interpretation of the operations on complex numbers|geometric interpretation of the operations on complex numbers]] and the definition of [[Exponentiation#Powers of e|powers of ''e'']] is the clue to understanding ''e''<sup>''ix''</sup> for real ''x''. Consider the [[right triangle]] {{nowrap|(0, 1, 1 + ''ix''/''n'').}} For big values of ''n'' the triangle is almost a [[circular sector]] with a small central angle equal to ''x''/''n'' [[radian]]s. The triangles {{nowrap|(0, (1 + ''ix''/''n'')<sup>''k''</sup>, (1 + ''ix''/''n'')<sup>''k''+1</sup>)}} are mutually [[Similarity (geometry) #Similar triangles|similar]] for all values of ''k''. So for large values of ''n'' the limiting point of {{nowrap|(1 + ''ix''/''n'')<sup>''n''</sup>}} is the point on the [[unit circle]] whose angle from the positive real axis is ''x'' radians. The [[polar coordinates]] of this point are {{nowrap|1=(''r'', ''θ'') = (1, ''x''),}} and the [[cartesian coordinate]]s are (cos ''x'', sin ''x''). So {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup> ''ix''</sup> = cos ''x'' + ''i''sin ''x'',}} and this is [[Euler's formula]], connecting [[algebra]] to [[trigonometry]] by means of [[complex number]]s.

The solutions to the equation ''e''<sup>''z''</sup> = 1 are the integer multiples of 2''iπ'':
:<math>\{ z : e^z = 1 \} = \{ 2k\pi i : k \in \mathbb{Z} \}.</math>
More generally, if e<sup>''b''</sup> = ''a'', then every solution to ''e''<sup>''z''</sup> = ''a'' can be obtained by adding an integer multiple of 2π''i'' to ''b'':
:<math>\{ z : e^z = a \} = \{ b + 2k\pi i : k \in \mathbb{Z} \}. </math>
Thus the complex exponential function is a [[periodic function]] with period 2π''i''.

More simply: ''e''<sup>''iπ''</sup> = &minus;1; ''e''<sup>''x'' + ''iy''</sup> = ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>(cos ''y'' + ''i'' sin ''y'').

===Trigonometric functions===
{{main|Euler's formula}}
It follows from [[Euler's formula]] that the [[trigonometric functions]] cosine and sine are 

:<math>\cos(z) = \frac{e^{i\cdot z} + e^{-i\cdot z}}{2} \qquad \sin(z) = \frac{e^{i\cdot z} - e^{-i\cdot z}}{2\cdot i}.\,</math>

Historically, cosine and sine were defined geometrically before the invention of complex numbers. The above formula reduces the complicated formulas for [[List_of_trigonometric_identities#Angle_sum_and_difference_identities|trigonometric functions of a sum]] into the simple exponentiation formula 
:<math>e^{i\cdot (x+y)}=e^{i\cdot x}\cdot e^{i\cdot y}.\,</math>
Using exponentiation with complex exponents many problems in  trigonometry can be reduced to algebra.

===Complex powers of e===
The power ''e''<sup>''x''+''i''·''y''</sup> is computed ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> · ''e''<sup>''i''·''y''</sup>. The real factor ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> is the [[absolute value]] of ''e''<sup>''x''+''i''·''y''</sup> and the complex factor ''e''<sup>''i''·''y''</sup> identifies the [[direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] of ''e''<sup>''x''+''i''·''y''</sup>.

===Complex powers of positive real numbers===

If ''a'' is a positive real number, and ''z'' is any complex number, the power ''a''<sup>''z''</sup> is defined as ''e''<sup>''z''·ln(''a'')</sup>, where ''x'' = ln(''a'') is the unique real solution to the equation ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> = ''a''. So the same method working for real exponents also works for complex exponents.
For example: 
:2<sup> ''i''</sup> = ''e''<sup> ''i''&middot;ln(2)</sup> = cos(ln(2))+''i''&middot;sin(ln(2)) = 0.7692+''i''&middot;0.63896
:''e''<sup> ''i''</sup> = 0.54030+''i''&middot;0.84147
:10<sup> ''i''</sup> = &minus;0.66820+''i''&middot;0.74398
:(''e''<sup> 2&middot;''&pi;''</sup>)<sup> ''i''</sup> = 535.49<sup> ''i''</sup> = 1

==Powers of complex numbers==

Integer powers of complex numbers are defined by repeated multiplication or division as above. Complex powers of positive reals are defined via ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> as above. These are continuous functions. Trying to extend these functions to the general case of noninteger powers of complex numbers that are not positive reals leads to difficulties. Either we define discontinuous functions or [[multivalued function]]s. Neither of these options is entirely satisfactory.

The rational power of a complex number must be the solution to an algebraic equation. Therefore it always has a finite number of possible values. For example, ''w'' = ''z''<sup>1/2</sup> must be a solution to the equation ''w''<sup>2</sup> = ''z''. But if ''w'' is a solution, then so is &minus;''w'', because (&minus;1)<sup>2</sup> = 1 . A unique but somewhat arbitary solution called the [[principal value]] can be chosen using a general rule which also applies for nonrational powers.

Complex powers and logarithms are more naturally handled as single valued functions on a [[Riemann surface]]. Single valued versions are defined by choosing a sheet. The value has a discontinuity along a [[branch cut]]. Choosing one out of many solutions as the principal value leaves us with functions that are not continuous, and the usual rules for manipulating powers can lead us astray.

Any nonrational power of a complex number has an infinite number of possible values because of the multi-valued nature of the [[complex logarithm]] (see [[#Complex logarithms|below]]). The [[principal value]] is a single value chosen from these by a rule which, amongst its other properties, ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part give the same value as for the corresponding real numbers.

Exponentiating a real number to a complex power is formally a different operation from that for the corresponding complex number. However in the common case of a positive real number the principal value is the same. The powers of negative real numbers are not always defined and are discontinuous even where defined. When dealing with complex numbers the complex number operation is normally used instead. For example: (−1)<sup>1/3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;−1 as a real, but when dealing with complex numbers (−1)<sup>1/3</sup> normally means either the principal value e<sup>π''i''/3</sup> or the set of values {e<sup>π''i''/3</sup>,&nbsp;e<sup>−π''i''/3</sup>,&nbsp;−1}.

===Powers of the imaginary unit===
If ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]] and ''n'' is an integer,
then ''i''<sup>''n''</sup> equals 1, ''i'', &minus;1, or &minus;''i'', according to whether the integer ''n'' is congruent to 0, 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. Because of this, the powers of ''i'' are useful for expressing [[sequence]]s of [[Root of unity#Periodicity|period 4]].

===Complex power of a complex number===

For complex numbers ''a'' and ''b'' with ''a''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0, the notation ''a''<sup>''b''</sup> is ambiguous in the same sense that [[complex logarithm|log&nbsp;''a'']] is.

To obtain a value of ''a''<sup>''b''</sup>, first choose a [[complex logarithm|logarithm]] of ''a''; call it log&nbsp;''a''.  Such a choice may be the [[complex logarithm#Definition of principal value|principal value]] Log&nbsp;''a'' (the default, if no other specification is given), or perhaps a value given by some other [[complex logarithm#Branches of the complex logarithm|branch of log&nbsp;''z'']] fixed in advance.  Then, using the [[complex exponential function]] one defines

:<math>a^b = e^{b \log a}</math>

because this agrees with the [[exponentiation#Real powers|earlier definition]] in the case where ''a'' is a positive real number and the (real) principal value of log&nbsp;''a'' is used.

If ''b'' is an [[integer]], then the value of ''a''<sup>''b''</sup> is independent of the choice of log&nbsp;''a'', and it agrees with the [[exponentiation#Exponentiation with integer exponents|earlier definition of exponentation with an integer exponent]].

If ''b'' is a [[rational number]] ''n''/''m'' in lowest terms with ''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, then the infinitely many choices of log&nbsp;''a'' yield only ''m'' different values for ''a''<sup>''b''</sup>; these values are the ''m'' complex solutions ''z'' to the equation ''z''<sup>''m''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>.

If ''b'' is an [[irrational number]], then the infinitely many choices of log&nbsp;''a'' lead to infinitely many distinct values for ''a''<sup>''b''</sup>.

The computation of complex powers is facilitated by converting the base ''a'' to [[polar form]], as described in detail [[#Computing complex powers|below]].

===Complex roots of unity===
{{main|Root of unity}}

A complex number ''a'' such that ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = 1 for a positive integer ''n'' is an ''' ''n''th root of unity'''.  Geometrically, the ''n''th roots of unity lie on the unit circle of the complex plane at the vertices of a regular ''n''-gon with one vertex on the real number 1.

If ''z''<sup>''n''</sup> = 1 but ''z''<sup>''k''</sup> ≠ 1 for all natural numbers ''k'' such that 0 < ''k'' < ''n'', then ''z'' is called a '''primitive ''n''th root of unity.'''   The negative unit &minus;1 is the only primitive square root of unity. The [[imaginary unit]] ''i'' is one of the two primitive 4-th roots of unity; the other one is &minus;''i''.

The number ''e''<sup>2''πi'' (1/''n'')</sup> is the primitive ''n''th root of unity with the smallest positive [[complex argument]].  (It is sometimes called the '''principal ''n''th root of unity''', although this terminology is not universal and should not be confused with the [[principal value]] of <sup>''n''</sup>√<span style="text-decoration:overline">1</span>, which is 1.<ref>This definition of a principal root of unity can be found in:

* "[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrincipalRootofUnity.html Principal root of unity]", MathWorld.</ref>) 

The other ''n''th roots of unity are given by 
:<math>\left( e^{2\pi i (1/n)} \right) ^k = e^{2\pi i k/n}</math>
for 2 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''.

===Roots of arbitrary complex numbers===
Although there are infinitely many possible values for a general complex logarithm, there are only a finite number of values for the power ''a<sup>z</sup>'' in the important special case where ''z'' = 1/''n'' and ''n'' is a positive integer. These are the '''''n''th roots''' of ''a''; they are solutions of the equation ''x<sup>n</sup>'' = ''a''.  As with real roots, a second root is also called a square root and a third root is also called a cube root. 

It is conventional in mathematics to define ''a''<sup>1/''n''</sup> as the principal value of the root. If ''a'' is a positive real number, it is also conventional to select a positive real number as the principal value of the root ''a''<sup>1/''n''</sup>.  For general complex numbers, the ''n''th root with the smallest argument is often selected as the principal value of the ''n''th root operation, as with principal values of roots of unity. 

The set of ''n''th roots of a complex number ''a'' is obtained by multiplying the principal value ''a''<sup>1/n</sup> by each of the ''n''th roots of unity. For example, the fourth roots of 16 are 2, &minus;2, 2''i'', and &minus;2''i'', because the principal value of the fourth root of 16 is 2 and the fourth roots of unity are 1, &minus;1, ''i'', and &minus;''i''.

===Computing complex powers===
<!-- {{main|Polar coordinate system}} This is not the MAIN article on complex powers -->
It is often easier to compute complex powers by writing the number to be exponentiated in [[complex number#polar form|polar form]].  Every complex number ''z'' can be written in the polar form
:<math>z = re^{i\theta} = e^{\log(r) + i\theta} \,,</math>
where ''r'' is a nonnegative real number and θ is the (real) [[complex argument|argument]] of ''z''.  The polar form has a simple geometric interpretation: if a complex number ''u'' + ''iv'' is thought of as representing a point (''u'', ''v'') in the [[complex plane]] using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]], then (''r'', θ) is the same point in [[polar coordinates]].  That is, ''r'' is the "radius" ''r''<sup>2</sup> = ''u''<sup>2</sup> + ''v''<sup>2</sup> and θ is the "angle" θ = [[atan2]](''v'', ''u'').  The polar angle θ is ambiguous since any multiple of 2π could be added to θ without changing the location of the point.  Each choice of θ gives in general a different possible value of the power.  A [[branch cut]] can be used to choose a specific value.  The principal value (the most common branch cut), corresponds to θ chosen in the interval (&minus;π, π]. For complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part using the principal value gives the same result as using the corresponding real number.

In order to compute the complex power ''a''<sup>''b''</sup>, write ''a'' in polar form: 
:<math>a = r e^{i\theta} \,</math>.
Then 
:<math>\log a = \log r + i \theta \,,</math>
and thus
:<math>a^b = e^{b \log a} = e^{b(\log r + i\theta)}. \,</math>
If ''b'' is decomposed as ''c'' + ''di'', then the formula for ''a''<sup>''b''</sup> can be written more explicitly as
:<math>\left( r^c e^{-d\theta} \right) e^{i (d \log r + c\theta)} = \left( r^c e^{-d\theta} \right) \left[ \cos(d \log r + c\theta) + i \sin(d \log r + c\theta) \right].</math><!-- e^{c \log r - d\theta + i (d \log r + c\theta)}  -->
This final formula allows complex powers to be computed easily from decompositions of the base into polar form and the exponent into Cartesian form.  It is shown here both in polar form and in Cartesian form (via Euler's identity).

The following examples use the principal value, the branch cut which causes θ to be in the interval (&minus;π, π]. To compute ''i''<sup>''i''</sup>, write ''i'' in polar and Cartesian forms:
:<math>i = 1 \cdot e^{i \pi/2},\,</math>
:<math>i = 0 + 1i.\, </math>
Then the formula above, with ''r'' = 1, θ = π/2, ''c'' = 0, and ''d'' = 1, yields:
:<math>\ i^i = \left( 1^0 e^{-\pi/2} \right) e^{i(1\cdot \log 1 + 0 \cdot \pi/2)} = e^{-\pi/2} \approx 0.2079.</math>

Similarly, to find (&minus;2)<sup>3 + 4''i''</sup>, compute the polar form of &minus;2,

:<math>-2 = 2e^{i \pi} \, ,</math>
and use the formula above to compute
:<math>(-2)^{3+4i} = \left( 2^3 e^{-4\pi} \right) e^{i(4\log(2) + 3\pi)} \approx (2.602 - 1.006 i) \cdot 10^{-5}.</math>

The value of a complex power depends on the branch used.  For example, if the polar form ''i'' = 1''e''<sup>''i''(5π/2)</sup> is used to compute ''i'' <sup>''i''</sup>, the power is found to be ''e''<sup>&minus;5π/2</sup>; the principal value of ''i'' <sup>''i''</sup>, computed above, is ''e''<sup>&minus;π/2</sup>. The set of all possible values for ''i'' <sup>''i''</sup> is given by:<ref>[http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/complex.shtml Complex number to a complex power may be real] at Cut The Knot gives some references to ''i''<sup>''i''</sup></ref>
:<math>i = 1 \cdot e^{i \pi/2 + i 2 \pi k}, \ \text{where } k \text{ is an integer},\,</math>
:<math>i^i = e^{i \left(i \pi/2 + i 2 \pi k\right)} ,</math>
::<math> = e^{-\left(\pi/2 + 2 \pi k\right)} .</math>
So there is an infinity of values which are possible candidates for the value of ''i''<sup>''i''</sup>, one for each integer ''k''. All of them have a zero imaginary part so one can say ''i''<sup>''i''</sup> has an infinity of valid real values.

=== Failure of power and logarithm identities ===

Some identities for powers and logarithms for positive real numbers will fail for complex numbers, no matter how complex powers and complex logarithms are defined.

For example,

* The identity log(''a''<sup>''b''</sup>) = ''b'' · log&thinsp;''a'' holds whenever ''a'' is a positive real number and ''b'' is a real number.  But for the [[principal branch]] of the complex logarithm one has
::<math> i\pi = \log(-1) = \log((-i)^2) \neq 2\log(-i) = 2(-i\pi/2) = -i\pi.</math>
:Regardless of which branch of the logarithm is used, a similar failure of the identity will exist. The best that can be said is that:
::<math>\log(a^b) = b \cdot \log(a) \pmod {2 \pi i} .</math>

:This identity does not hold even when considering log as a multivalued function. The possible values of log(''a''<sup>''b''</sup>) contain those of ''b'' · log&thinsp;''a'' as a subset. Using Log(''a'') for the principal value of log(''a'') and ''m'', ''n'' as any integers the possible values of both sides are:
::<math>\left\{\log(a^b)\right\} = \left\{ b \cdot \operatorname{Log}(a) + b \cdot 2 \pi i n + 2 \pi i m \right\} ,</math>
::<math>\left\{b . \log(a)\right\} = \left\{ b \cdot \operatorname{Log}(a) + b \cdot 2 \pi i n \right\} .</math>

* The identities (''ab'')<sup>''c''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''c''</sup>''b''<sup>''c''</sup> and (''a''/''b'')<sup>''c''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''c''</sup>/''b''<sup>''c''</sup> are valid when ''a'' and ''b'' are positive real numbers and ''c'' is a real number.  But a calculation using principal branches shows that 
::<math>1 = (-1\cdot -1)^{1/2}   \not = (-1)^{1/2}(-1)^{1/2} = -1,</math>
:and
::<math>i = (-1)^{1/2} = \left (\frac{1}{-1}\right )^{1/2} \not = \frac{1^{1/2}}{(-1)^{1/2}} = \frac{1}{i} = -i.</math> 
:On the other hand, when ''c'' is an integer, the identities are valid for all nonzero complex numbers.

:If exponentiation is considered as a multivalued function then the possible values of (−1.−1)<sup>1/2</sup> are {1, −1}. The identity holds but saying {1} = {(−1.−1)<sup>1/2</sup>} is wrong.

* The identity (e<sup>''a''</sup>)<sup>''b''</sup> = e<sup>''ab''</sup> holds for real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', but assuming its truth for complex numbers leads to the following paradox, discovered in 1827 by [[Thomas Clausen (mathematician)|Clausen]]:<ref>Thomas Clausen, [[Crelle's Journal|Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]] '''2''' (1827), 286–287.</ref> For any integer ''n'',
::e<sup>1+2&pi;''in''</sup> = e<sup>1</sup>e<sup>2&pi;''in''</sup> = e·1 = e,
::(e<sup>1+2&pi;''in''</sup>)<sup>1+2&pi;''in''</sup> = e,
::e<sup>1+4&pi;''in''−4&pi;<sup>2</sup>''n''<sup>2</sup></sup> = e,
::e<sup>1</sup>e<sup>4&pi;''in''</sup>e<sup>−4&pi;<sup>2</sup>''n''<sup>2</sup></sup> = e, and
::e<sup>−4&pi;<sup>2</sup>''n''<sup>2</sup></sup> = 1,
:but this is false when the integer ''n'' is nonzero.

:There are a number of problems in the reasoning:
:The major error is that changing the order of exponentiation in going from line two to three changes what the principal value chosen will be.
:From the multi valued point of view the first error occurs even sooner, it is implicit in the first line and not obvious. It is that e is a real number whereas the result of  e<sup>1+2&pi;''in''</sup> is a complex number better represented as e+0''i''. Substituting the complex number for the real on the second line makes the power have multiple possible values. Changing the order of exponentiation from lines two to three also affects how many possible values the result can have.

==Zero to the zero power==
[[Image:X^y.png|right|thumb|300px|Plot of z = abs(x)<sup>y</sup> with red curves yielding different limits as (x,y) approaches (0,0). The green curves all yield a limit of 1.]]
 
Most authors agree with the statements related to 0<sup>0</sup> in the two lists below, but come to differing conclusions when it comes to ''defining'' 0<sup>0</sup> or not: see the next subsection.

In most settings ''not involving continuity'' (for instance, those in which only integral exponents are considered), interpreting 0<sup>0</sup> as 1 simplifies formulas and eliminates the need for special cases in theorems. (See the next paragraph for some settings that ''do'' involve continuity.)
For example:
*Regarding 0<sup>0</sup> as an [[empty product]] of zeros suggests a value of 1.
*The [[Exponentiation#Combinatorial interpretation|combinatorial interpretation]] of 0<sup>0</sup> is the number of empty [[tuples]] of elements from the empty set. There is exactly one empty tuple. 
*Equivalently, the [[#Exponentiation over sets|set-theoretic interpretation]] of 0<sup>0</sup> is the number of functions from the empty set to the empty set.  There is exactly one such function, the [[empty function]].<ref name="Bourbaki">N. Bourbaki, Elements of Mathematics, Theory of Sets, Springer-Verlag, 2004, III.§3.5.</ref>
*It greatly simplifies the theory of [[polynomial]]s and [[power series]] that a constant term can be written ''ax''<sup>0</sup> for an arbitrary ''x''. For example:
** The formula for the coefficients of a product of polynomials would lose much of its simplicity if constant terms had to be treated specially.
** Identities like <math>\textstyle \frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n</math> and <math>\textstyle e^{x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}</math> are not valid for ''x'' = 0 unless 0<sup>0</sup> = 1.
**The [[binomial theorem]] <math>\textstyle(1+x)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k</math> is not valid for ''x'' = 0 unless 0<sup>0</sup> = 1.<ref>"Some textbooks leave the quantity 0<sup>0</sup> undefined, because the functions ''x''<sup>0</sup> and 0<sup>''x''</sup> have different limiting values when ''x'' decreases to 0. But this is a mistake. We must define ''x''<sup>0</sup> = 1, for all ''x'', if the binomial theorem is to be valid when ''x'' = 0, ''y'' = 0, and/or ''x'' = −''y''. The binomial theorem is too important to be arbitrarily restricted! By contrast, the function 0<sup>''x''</sup> is quite unimportant".{{cite book|title=[[Concrete Mathematics]]|edition=1st edition|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Publishing Co|date=1989-01-05|isbn=0-201-14236-8|author=[[Ronald Graham]], [[Donald Knuth]], and [[Oren Patashnik]]|pages=162|chapter=Binomial coefficients}}</ref>
*In [[differential calculus]], the [[power rule]] <math>\textstyle\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}</math> is not valid for ''n'' = 1 at ''x'' = 0 unless 0<sup>0</sup> = 1.

On the other hand, 0<sup>0</sup> must be handled as an [[indeterminate form]] in settings where the exponent varies continuously:
*When ''f''(''t'') and ''g''(''t'') are real-valued functions approaching 0 (as ''t'' approaches a real number or ±∞), with ''f''(''t'') > 0, the function ''f''(''t'')<sup>''g''(''t'')</sup> need not approach 1.  In fact, depending on ''f'' and ''g'', the limit of ''f''(''t'')<sup>''g''(''t'')</sup> can be any nonnegative real number or +∞, or it can be undefined. Limits involving algebraic operations can often be evaluated by replacing subexpressions by their limits; if the resulting expression does not determine the original limit, the expression is known as an [[indeterminate form]].<ref>{{cite book|first=S. C.|last=Malik |coauthors=Savita Arora|year=1992|title=Mathematical Analysis|pages=223|isbn=978-8122403237|quote=In general the limit of φ(''x'')/ψ(''x'') when ''x''=''a'' in case the limits of both the functions exist is equal to the limit of the numerator divided by the denominator. But what happens when both limits are zero? The division (0/0) then becomes meaningless. A case like this is known as an indeterminate form. Other such forms are ∞/∞ 0&times;∞,  ∞&minus;∞, 0<sup>0</sup>, 1<sup>∞</sup> and ∞<sup>0</sup>}}</ref>

:For example, the following expressions are all of the form ''f''(''t'')<sup>''g''(''t'')</sup> with ''f''(''t''),''g''(''t'')&nbsp;→&nbsp;0 as [[one-sided limit|''t''&nbsp;→&nbsp;0<sup>+</sup>]], and have the stated limits for any positive constant ''a'':
::<math> \lim_{t \to 0^+} {t}^{t} = 1, \quad \lim_{t \to 0^+} (e^{-1/t^2})^t = 0, \quad \lim_{t \to 0^+} (e^{-1/t^2})^{-t} = +\infty </math>
::<math> \lim_{t \to 0^+} (e^{-a/t})^{t} = e^{-a}, \quad \lim_{t \to 0^+} (e^{-a/t})^{-t} = e^a </math>.
:The limits are all different so clearly no single value of 0<sup>0</sup> can be defined as the limit for every case. This behavior results from the fact that the two-variable function ''x''<sup>''y''</sup>, though continuous on the set {(''x'',''y''): ''x'' > 0}, cannot be extended to a [[continuous function]] on any set containing (0,0), no matter how 0<sup>0</sup> is defined.<ref>{{cite journal|author=L. J. Paige|title=A note on indeterminate forms|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=61|issue=3|month=March | year=1954|pages=189&ndash;190|doi=10.2307/2307224}}</ref> 

*The function ''z''<sup>''z''</sup> is defined for nonzero [[complex number]]s ''z'' by choosing a [[principal branch|branch]] of log ''z'' and setting ''z''<sup>''z''</sup> := ''e''<sup>''z''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''z''</sup>, but there is no [[principal branch|branch]] of log ''z'' defined at ''z'' = 0, let alone in a neighborhood of 0.<ref>"... Let's start at ''x'' = 0. Here ''x''<sup>''x''</sup> is undefined."  Mark D. Meyerson, The ''X''<sup>''x''</sup> Spindle, ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''69''', no. 3 (June 1996), 198-206.</ref>  There is no [[holomorphic function]] defined in a neighborhood of 0 that agrees with ''z''<sup>''z''</sup> for all positive real numbers ''z''.

===History of differing points of view===

Different authors interpret the situation above in different ways:
* Some argue that the best value for 0<sup>0</sup> depends on context, and hence that [[defined and undefined|defining]] it once and for all is problematic.<ref>Examples include Edwards and Penny (1994). ''Calculus'', 4th ed,, Prentice-Hall, p. 466, and Keedy, Bittinger, and Smith (1982). ''Algebra Two.'' Addison-Wesley, p. 32.</ref>  According to Benson (1999), "The choice whether to define 0<sup>0</sup> is based on convenience, not on correctness."<ref>Donald C. Benson, ''The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies.'' New York Oxford University Press (UK), 1999. ISBN 9780195117219</ref>
* Others argue that 0<sup>0</sup> is 1.  According to p. 408 of [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] (1992), it "''has'' to be 1".<ref name="Knuth1992">[[Donald Knuth|Donald E. Knuth]], Two notes on notation, ''[[American Mathematical Monthly|Amer. Math. Monthly]]'' '''99''' no. 5 (May 1992), 403–422.</ref>  

The debate has been going on at least since the early 1800s.
At that time, most mathematicians agreed that 0<sup>0</sup> = 1, but in 1821 [[Cauchy]]<ref>[[Cauchy|Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], ''Cours d'Analyse de l'École Royale Polytechnique'' (1821).  In his ''Oeuvres Complètes'', series 2, volume 3.</ref> listed 0<sup>0</sup> along with expressions like 0/0 in a table of undefined forms.
In the 1830s Libri<ref>Guillaume Libri, Note sur les valeurs de la fonction 0<sup>0<sup>x</sup></sup>, ''[[Crelle's Journal|Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]'' '''6''' (1830), 67–72.</ref><ref>Guillaume Libri, Mémoire sur les fonctions discontinues, ''[[Crelle's Journal|Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]'' '''10''' (1833), 303–316.</ref> published an unconvincing argument for 0<sup>0</sup> = 1, and [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]]<ref>[[August Ferdinand Möbius|A. F. Möbius]], Beweis der Gleichung 0<sup>0</sup> = 1, nach [[Johann Friedrich Pfaff|J. F. Pfaff]], ''[[Crelle's Journal|Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]'' '''12''' (1834), 134–136.</ref> sided with him, erroneously claiming that 
<math>\lim_{t \to 0^+} f(t)^{g(t)} = 1</math> whenever <math>\lim_{t \to 0^+} f(t) = \lim_{t \to 0^+} g(t) = 0.</math> 
A commentator who signed his name simply as "S" provided the counterexample of (''e''<sup>−1/''t''</sup>)<sup>t</sup> (which can be obtained in one example above by taking ''a'' = 1), and this quieted the debate for some time, with the apparent conclusion of this episode being that 0<sup>0</sup> should be undefined.
More details can be found in [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] (1992).<ref name="Knuth1992" />

===Treatment in programming languages and calculators===
Computer programming languages that evaluate 0<sup>0</sup> to 1<ref>For example, see {{cite paper|title=Rationale for International Standard &mdash; Programming Languages &mdash; C|version=Revision 5.10|date=April 2003|author=John Benito|url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf|page=182|format=PDF}}</ref> include [[bc programming language|bc]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[J (programming language)|J]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[MATLAB]], [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[R programming language|R]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], and [[SQL]]. In the [[.NET Framework]], the [[method (computer science)|method]] <code>System.Math.Pow</code> treats 0<sup>0</sup> to be 1.

[[Microsoft Excel]] issues an error when it evaluates 0<sup>0</sup>.

[[Microsoft Windows]]' Calculator and the calculator in [[Google search]]<ref>http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=0%5E0</ref> evaluate 0<sup>0</sup> to 1.

[[Maple (software)|Maple]] simplifies ''a''<sup>0</sup> to 1 and 0<sup>''a''</sup> to 0, even if no constraints are placed on ''a'', and evaluates 0<sup>0</sup> to 1. 

[[Mathematica]] simplifies ''a''<sup>0</sup> to 1,  even if no constraints are placed on ''a''. It does not simplify 0<sup>''a''</sup>, and it takes 0<sup>0</sup> to be an indeterminate form.

==Limits of powers==

The section [[#zero to the zero power|zero to the zero power]] gives a number of examples of limits which are of the [[indeterminate form]] 0<sup>0</sup>. The limits in these examples exist, but have different values, showing that the two-variable function ''x''<sup>''y''</sup> has no limit at the point (0,0). One may ask at what points this function does have a limit.

More precisely, we consider the function ''f''(''x'',''y'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>''y''</sup> defined on ''D''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{(''x'',''y'')&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}. We view ''D'' as a subset of <span style="text-decoration: overline">'''R'''</span><sup>2</sup> (that is, the set of all pairs (''x'',''y'') with ''x'',''y'' belonging to the [[extended real number line]] <span style="text-decoration: overline">'''R'''</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;[&minus;∞,&nbsp;+∞], endowed with the [[product topology]]), and ask at what points the function ''f'' has a limit. 

In fact, ''f'' has a limit at all [[accumulation point]]s of ''D'', except for (0,0), (+∞,0), (1,+∞) and (1,−∞).<ref>N. Bourbaki, ''Topologie générale'', V.4.2.</ref> Accordingly, this allows one to define the powers ''x''<sup>''y''</sup> by continuity whenever 0&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;+∞, −∞ ≤&nbsp;y&nbsp;≤&nbsp;+∞, except for 0<sup>0</sup>, (+∞)<sup>0</sup>, 1<sup>+∞</sup> and 1<sup>−∞</sup>, which remain indeterminate forms. 

Under this definition by continuity, we obtain: 

* ''a''<sup>+∞</sup> = +∞ and ''a''<sup>-∞</sup> = 0, when 1 < ''a'' ≤ +∞.
* ''a''<sup>+∞</sup> = 0 and ''a''<sup>-∞</sup> = +∞, when 0 ≤ ''a'' < 1. 
* 0<sup>''b''</sup> = 0 and (+∞)<sup>''b''</sup> = +∞, when 0 < ''b'' ≤ +∞.
* 0<sup>''b''</sup> = +∞ and (+∞)<sup>''b''</sup> = 0, when -∞ ≤ ''b'' < 0.

It should be borne in mind that these powers are obtained by taking limits of ''x''<sup>''y''</sup> for ''positive'' values of ''x''. This method does not permit a definition of ''x''<sup>''y''</sup> when ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0, since pairs (''x'',''y'') with ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0 are not accumulation points of ''D''.

On the other hand, when ''n'' is an integer, the power ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> is already meaningful for all values of ''x'', including negative ones. This may make the definition 0<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+∞ obtained above for negative ''n'' problematic when ''n'' is odd, since in this case ''t''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;→&nbsp;+∞ as ''t'' tends to 0 through positive values, but not negative ones.

==Efficiently computing a power==
The simplest method of computing ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> requires ''n''&minus;1 multiplication operations, but it can be computed more efficiently as illustrated by the following example.  To compute 2<sup>100</sup>, note that 100 = 96 + 4 and
96 = 3*32.  Compute the following in order:
:2<sup>2</sup> = 4
:(2<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> =  2<sup>4</sup> = 16
:(2<sup>4</sup>)<sup>2</sup> =  2<sup>8</sup> = 256
:(2<sup>8</sup>)<sup>2</sup> =  2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536
:(2<sup>16</sup>)<sup>2</sup> =  2<sup>32</sup> = 4,294,967,296
: 2<sup>32</sup> 2<sup>32</sup> 2<sup>32</sup>2<sup>4</sup> = 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376 = 2<sup>100</sup>
This series of steps only requires 8 multiplication operations instead of 99.

In general, the number of multiplication operations required to compute 
''a''<sup>''n''</sup> can be reduced to [[asymptotic notation|&Theta;]](log ''n'') by using [[exponentiation by squaring]] or (more generally) [[addition-chain exponentiation]].  Finding the ''minimal'' sequence of multiplications (the minimal-length addition chain for the exponent) for ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> is a difficult problem for which no efficient algorithms are currently known, but many reasonably efficient heuristic algorithms are available.

==Exponential notation for function names==
Placing an integer superscript after the name or symbol of a function, as if the function were being raised to a power, commonly refers to repeated [[function composition]] rather than repeated multiplication. Thus ''f''<sup>3</sup>(''x'') may mean ''f''(''f''(''f''(''x'')));
in particular, ''f''<sup> −1</sup>(''x'') usually denotes the [[inverse function]] of ''f''. [[Iterated function]]s are of interest in the study of [[fractal]]s and [[dynamical systems]]. [[Babbage]] was the first to study the problem of finding a [[functional square root]] ''f''<sup>1/2</sup>(''x'').

However, for historical reasons, a special syntax applies to the [[trigonometric functions]]: a positive exponent applied to the function's abbreviation means that the result is raised to that power, while an exponent of &minus;1 denotes the inverse function. That is, sin<sup>2</sup>''x'' is just a shorthand way to write (sin&nbsp;''x'')<sup>2</sup> without using parentheses, whereas sin<sup>&minus;1</sup>''x'' refers to the inverse function of the [[sine]], also called arcsin&nbsp;''x''. There is no need for a shorthand for the reciprocals of trigonometric functions since each has its own name and abbreviation; for example,
1/sin ''x'' = (sin&nbsp;''x'')<sup>&minus;1</sup> is csc&nbsp;''x''.  A similar convention applies to logarithms, where log<sup>2</sup>''x'' usually means (log ''x'')<sup>2</sup>, not log log ''x''.

==Generalizations of exponentiation ==
===Exponentiation in abstract algebra===
Exponentiation for integer exponents can be defined for quite general structures in  [[abstract algebra]].

Let ''X'' be a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] with a [[power-associative]]  [[binary operation]] which is written multiplicatively,. Then ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> is defined for any element ''x'' of ''X'' and any nonzero [[natural number]] ''n'' as ''x'' multiplied by itself ''n'' times.

* <math>\ (x^i x^j) x^k = x^i (x^j x^k),</math> Power associative
* <math>\ x^1=x </math>
* <math>\ x^{m+n}=x^m x^n </math>
* <math>\ (x^m)^n=x^{mn} </math>

If the operation has a two-sided [[identity element]] 1 (often denoted by ''e''), then ''x''<sup>0</sup> is defined to be equal to 1 for any ''x''.

* <math>\ x1 = 1x = x, </math> Two sided identity
* <math>\ x^0=1 </math>

If the operation also has two-sided [[inverse element|inverses]], and multiplication is associative then the [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] is a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The inverse of ''x'' can be denoted by ''x''<sup>−1</sup> and follows all the usual rules for exponents. 

* <math>\ x x^{-1} = x^{-1} x = 1, </math> Two sided inverse
* <math>\ (x y) z = x (y z), </math> Associative
* <math>\ x^{-n}=\left(x^{-1}\right)^n </math>
* <math>\ x^{m-n}=x^m \cdot x^{-n}</math>

If the multiplication operation is [[commutative]] (as for instance in [[abelian group]]s), then  the following holds:
* <math>\ (xy)^n = x^n y^n </math>

If the binary operation is written additively, as it often is for [[abelian groups]], then "exponentiation is repeated multiplication" can be reinterpreted as "[[multiplication]] is repeated [[addition]]". Thus, each of the laws of exponentiation above has an [[analogy|analogue]] among laws of multiplication.

When one has several operations around, any of which might be repeated using exponentiation, it is common to indicate which operation is being repeated by placing its symbol in the superscript. Thus, ''x''<sup>*''n''</sup> is ''x'' * ··· * ''x'', while ''x''<sup>#''n''</sup> is ''x'' # ··· # ''x'', whatever the operations * and # might be.

Superscript notation is also used, especially in [[group theory]], to indicate [[Conjugacy class|conjugation]]. That is, ''g''<sup>''h''</sup> = ''h''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''gh'', where ''g'' and ''h'' are elements of some [[group (math)|group]]. Although conjugation obeys some of the same laws as exponentiation, it is not an example of repeated multiplication in any sense. A [[quandle]] is an [[algebraic structure]] in which these laws of conjugation play a central role.

===Exponentiation over sets===
{{main|Cartesian product}}

If ''n'' is a natural number and ''A'' is an arbitrary set, the expression ''A''<sup>''n''</sup> is often used to denote the set of ordered ''n''-tuples of elements of ''A''. This is equivalent to letting ''A''<sup>''n''</sup> denote the set of functions from the set {0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n''&minus;1} to the set ''A''; the ''n''-tuple (''a''<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;''a''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''a''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;a<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>) represents the function that sends ''i'' to ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>.    

For an infinite [[cardinal number]] κ and a set ''A'', the notation ''A''<sup>κ</sup> is also used to denote the set of all functions from a set of size κ to ''A''.   This is sometimes written <sup>κ</sup>''A'' to distinguish it from cardinal exponentiation, defined below. 

This generalized exponential can also be defined for operations on sets or for sets with extra [[Mathematical structure|structure]]. For example, in [[linear algebra]], it makes sense to index [[direct sum]]s of [[vector space]]s over arbitrary index sets.
That is, we can speak of
: <math>\bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} V_{i},</math>
where each ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> is a vector space.
Then if ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''V'' for each ''i'', the resulting direct sum can be written in exponential notation as ''V''<sup>(+)''N''</sup>, or simply ''V''<sup>''N''</sup> with the understanding that the direct sum is the default.
We can again replace the set ''N'' with a cardinal number ''n'' to get ''V''<sup>''n''</sup>, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality ''n'', this is defined only [[up to isomorphism]].
Taking ''V'' to be the [[field (algebra)|field]] '''R''' of [[real number]]s (thought of as a vector space over itself) and ''n'' to be some [[natural number]], we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.

If the base of the exponentiation operation is a set, the exponentiation operation is the [[Cartesian product]] unless otherwise stated. Since multiple Cartesian products produce an ''n''-[[tuple]], which can be represented by a function on a set of appropriate cardinality, ''S''<sup>''N''</sup> becomes simply the set of all [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s from ''N'' to ''S'' in this case:
: <math>S^N \equiv \{ f: N \to S \}.\,</math>
This fits in with the exponentiation of cardinal numbers, in the sense that |''S''<sup>''N''</sup>| = |''S''|<sup>|''N''|</sup>, where |''X''| is the cardinality of ''X''.
When ''N''=2={0,1}, we have |2<sup>''X''</sup>| = 2<sup>|''X''|</sup>, where 2<sup>''X''</sup>, usually denoted by '''P'''''X'', is the [[power set]] of ''X''; each [[subset]] ''Y'' of ''X'' corresponds uniquely to a function on ''X'' taking the value 1 for ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''Y'' and 0 for ''x''&nbsp;∉&nbsp;''Y''.
<!-- (This is where the term "power set" comes from. This needs a source -->

=== Exponentiation in category theory ===
{{main|Cartesian closed category}}
In a [[Cartesian closed category]], the [[exponential (category theory)|exponential]] operation can be used to raise an arbitrary object to the power of another object.  This generalizes the [[Cartesian product]] in the category of sets.

===Exponentiation of cardinal and ordinal numbers===
{{main|Cardinal number#Cardinal arithmetic|l1=cardinal arithmetic|ordinal arithmetic}}

In [[set theory]], there are exponential operations for [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[ordinal number|ordinal]] numbers. 

If κ and λ are cardinal numbers, the expression κ<sup>λ</sup> represents the cardinality of the set of functions from any set of cardinality λ to any set of cardinality κ.<ref name="Bourbaki">N. Bourbaki, Elements of Mathematics, Theory of Sets, Springer-Verlag, 2004, III.§3.5.</ref>  If κ and λ are finite, then this agrees with the ordinary arithmetic exponential operation.  For example, the set of 3-tuples of elements from a 2-element set has cardinality 8 = 2<sup>3</sup>.

Exponentiation of cardinal numbers is distinct from exponentiation of [[ordinal number]]s, which is defined by a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] process involving [[transfinite induction]].

== Repeated exponentiation ==
Just as exponentiation of natural numbers is motivated by repeated multiplication, it is possible to define an operation based on repeated exponentiation; this operation is sometimes called [[tetration]].  Iterating tetration leads to another operation, and so on.  This sequence of operations is expressed by the [[Ackermann function]] and [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]].

==Exponentiation in programming languages==
The superscript notation ''x''<sup>''y''</sup> is convenient in handwriting but inconvenient for [[typewriter]]s and [[computer terminal]]s that align the baselines of all characters on each line. Many [[programming language]]s have alternate ways of expressing exponentiation that do not use superscripts:
* x ↑ y: [[Algol programming language|Algol]], [[Commodore BASIC]]
* x ^ y: [[BASIC]], [[J programming language|J]], [[Matlab]],  [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[TeX]] (and its derivatives), [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (for integer exponents), and most [[computer algebra system]]s
* x ** y: [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Bash]], [[COBOL]], [[Fortran]], [[FoxPro]], [[Perl]], [[PL/I]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[SAS programming language|SAS]], [[ABAP]], Haskell (for floating-point exponents), [[Turing (programming language)|Turing]]
* x * y: [[APL programming language|APL]]
* Power(x, y): Microsoft Excel, Delphi/Pascal (declared in "Math"-unit)
* pow(x, y): [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[PHP]]
* Math.pow(x, y): [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Modula-3]]
* Math.Pow(x, y): [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]
* (expt x y): [[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]

In Bash, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby, the symbol ^ represents bitwise [[XOR]]. In Pascal, it represents [[indirection]].

==History of the notation==
The term ''power'' was used by [[Euclid]] for the square of a line. [[Nicolas Chuquet]] used a form of exponential notation in the 15th century, which was later used by [[Henricus Grammateus]] and [[Michael Stifel]]. [[Samuel Jeake]] introduced the term ''indices'' in 1696.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|class=Miscellaneous|id=Mathematical_notation|title=Etymology of some common mathematical terms}}</ref> In the 16th century [[Robert Recorde]] used the terms square, cube, zenzizenzic (fourth power), surfolide (fifth), zenzicube (sixth), second surfolide (seventh) and [[Zenzizenzizenzic]] (eighth). ''Biquadrate'' has been used to refer to the fourth power as well.

Some mathematicians (e.g., [[Isaac Newton]]) used exponents only for powers greater than two, preferring to represent squares as repeated multiplication. Thus they would write polynomials, for example, as ''ax'' + ''bxx'' + ''cx''<sup>3</sup> + ''d''.

Another historical synonym, '''involution''',<ref>This definition of "involution" appears in the OED second edition, 1989, and Merriam-Webster online dictionary [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/involution].  The most recent usage in this sense cited by the OED is from 1806.</ref> is now rare and should not be confused with [[Involution (mathematics)|its more common meaning]].
