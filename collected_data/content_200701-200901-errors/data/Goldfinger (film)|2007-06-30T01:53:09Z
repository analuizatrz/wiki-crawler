'''''Goldfinger''''' is the [[Academy Award]] winning third [[film]] in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]] and the third to star [[Sean Connery]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. Released in December [[1964 in film|1964]], the film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and was the first of four directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The film's plot centers around [[James Bond]] attempting to stop the gold-obsessed tycoon [[Auric Goldfinger]] from detonating a [[dirty bomb]] inside of [[Fort Knox]], irradiating the gold reserves and thereby increasing the value of his private stock.

The film is generally regarded as the first official Bond [[blockbuster]] as well as being the template for all future Bond films; it is usually credited with triggering what is known as the James Bond craze.  The film made cinematic history when it recaptured its production costs in a record setting three weeks, despite a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. ''Goldfinger'' was also the first Bond film to use a pop star to sing the theme song; which would follow for every Bond film since except ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', which had an orchestral theme with no vocal. The theme song [[Goldfinger (song)|Goldfinger]] was an international smash, cracking the [[Billboard]] Top 5 and turning Welsh-born [[Shirley Bassey]] and her sassy, bravura delivery into the benchmark for Bond theme's that followed.  It is also one of the most critically acclaimed entries in the Bond franchise. In 1965 [[Norman Wanstall]] received an [[Academy Award for Sound Editing]] for his work on the film. The [[American Film Institute]] has also honoured the film four times ranking it No. 90 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|best movie quote]] ("A martini. [[Shaken, not stirred]]."), No. 53 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Songs|best song]] ("Goldfinger"), No. 49 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|best villain]] ([[Auric Goldfinger]]), and No. 71 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills|most thrilling film]].

''Goldfinger'' was the first James Bond film broadcast on [[United States|U.S.]] television, on [[September 17]], [[1972]] by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Simultaneously, it garnered the highest [[Nielsen Ratings]] of any film broadcast on television at that time: 49 percent of all viewers. The other "first" the film is famous for: Bond Girls with sexually conspicuous names, i.e. [[Honor Blackman|Honor Blackman's]] notorious and legendary, "[[Pussy Galore]]".

It was recently announced that Goldfinger would be theatrically re-released in the UK on 27th July 2007 on new digital prints distributed to around 150 multiplex cinemas.

==Production==
[[Image:007Connery.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Sean Connery]] in the white tuxedo as James Bond in the pre-title sequence]]
Goldfinger was the first Bond film with the budget to showcase bits of high technology that became a staple of the film series. ''Goldfinger'' had what was then considered a large budget of $3.5 million dollars, and was the first James Bond film classified as a box-office [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].

[[Jack Lord]] initially was slated to reprise the Felix Leiter role, originated in the first James Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.  Different stories abound as to why he was replaced at the last minute, by [[Cec Linder]], ranging from Lord demanding more money and equal billing with Connery to scheduling conflicts, to the producers not wanting Lord back as Leiter, concerned he might upstage Connery.  The next actor to play Felix Leiter in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', [[Rik Van Nutter]], took on  an appearance that more resembled Jack Lord's in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.

Concerned about censors, the film's producers thought about changing Pussy Galore's name to "Kitty Galore". They kept the original name when British newspapers began to refer to Honor Blackman as "Pussy" in the lead up to production. Pussy's name is actually connected to her leadership of a circus group of cat-burglar, cat-women Amazon lesbian acrobats (called "abrocats") in the novel, but that connection, and other complications, did not survive to the screen adaptation.

In the film, Goldfinger’s ethnicity is Teutonic, given Gert Fröbe's heavy German accent (which required dubbing) and dyed red-blond hair. Fröbe was chosen as the villain because producers Saltzman and Broccoli had seen his performance in a German thriller titled 'Es geschah am hellichten Tag' ('It happened in broad daylight', 1958). In that film, Fröbe was a psychopathic serial killer. Broccoli and Saltzman had seen the movie and decided upon the 'big bad German' for the role. In the film, a new Goldfinger fascination with Nazi gold history is revealed when Bond tempts him to betting high stakes against a lost, historical Nazi gold bar, an incident not in the novel (the golf game is merely for a large amount of cash).

The film was temporarily banned in [[Israel]] due to [[Gert Fröbe]]'s connections with the actual [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]]. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a [[Jewish]] family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during [[World War II]].

Sean Connery never traveled to the United States to film this movie. Bond's American scenes were filmed in Pinewood Studios, London. The scene where Bond pushes ''down'' the light switch to turn ''on'' his suite's light, discovering the dead, golden Jill, is an English light switch on an English sound stage. Fleming visited the set of ''Goldfinger'', but died in 1964 shortly before it was released.

The golf club scene was shot at Stoke Poges Golf Club in [[Buckinghamshire]]. When Oddjob decapitates the statue, the statue's head falls onto its arm, causing it to move and miraculously reposition. Later, when Bond switches on his car's radar scanner, the Golf Club's actual location is correctly show on the screen.

For security reasons, the filmmakers were not allowed to film inside [[Fort Knox]]. All sets for the interior of Fort Knox were designed and built from scratch.  However, a letter from a real-life Fort Knox controller complimented Ken Adam and the production team on their vivid imaginations. The three-dimensional scale-model outdoor map Goldfinger used during his mission briefing, is currently displayed at the [[Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor]].

==Plot==
[[Image:Miamibeachnorth.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Miami Beach]]
[[Image:Frobe1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Gert Frobe]] as [[Auric Goldfinger]]]]

In the pre-title sequence, Bond destroys a Mexican drug lord's base with plastic explosives, and defeats a Mexican thug in a bedroom brawl. The film's story-proper begins in [[Miami Beach]], [[Florida]], U.S.A., with CIA agent Felix Leiter delivering to Bond a message from M to watch Auric Goldfinger.
Bond foils Goldfinger's cheating at [[gin rummy]], by distracting his woman employee, [[Jill Masterson]], who is reporting Goldfinger's opponent's hand by using binoculars. After foiling the scheme and forcing Goldfinger to lose, Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship in Bond's hotel suite. Afterwards, as Bond fetches fresh champagne from the kitchen, he is struck unconscious  by Oddjob, Goldfinger's Korean manservant. Upon waking, Bond discovers Jill covered with gold paint, dead of epidermal suffocation.

Later in London, Bond learns that his true mission is determining  how Goldfinger transports gold among countries, and to determine if he is doing so illegally. Bond meets Goldfinger, socially, on a golf course. They play a high-stakes golf game; Bond lures Goldfinger with the prospect of winning a [[Nazi]] gold bar from [[World War II]]; Goldfinger cheats, Bond discovers him, yet allows the cheating to continue, switching Goldfinger's golf ball and forcing his loss, as they were playing strict rules. After settling the bet, Goldfinger warns Bond, by having Oddjob decapitate a statue with his steel-rimmed [[top hat]]. 

Bond implants a homing device in Goldfinger's automobile and follows him to [[Switzerland]], where he meets Tilly Masterson, Jill's sister. Tilly shoots at Goldfinger with a [[sniper rifle]], missing him, but almost shoots Bond instead. As Tilly flees the scene in her Ford Mustang, Bond catches up to her and slashes two of her car's tires; subsequently, Bond takes her to a service station.

That night, Bond reconnoiters Goldfinger's plant, learning that Goldfinger has a foundry and is casting parts of his [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]] in 18 kt. gold (white gold in the novel), to smuggle the gold from England to Europe. He also overhears Goldfinger talking with a Red Chinese agent about 'Operation Grandslam'. Leaving, he encounters Tilly re-trying to shoot Goldfinger, and accidentally trips an alarm. During their escape, Oddjob breaks Tilly's neck with a throw of his hat and Bond is captured.  However, since Bond is made to drive his own car, the spy uses its special modifications first remove the guard riding with him with the passenger [[ejector seat]] and then attempts to escape the facility.  Unfortunately, he confuses a mirror image of his own car as another car about to ram him and is captured after crashing his car trying to avoid it.

[[Image:007Goldfingerlaserclassic.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The laser scene]]
Bond wakes tied to a gold table underneath an industrial [[laser]], the beam of which is set to slowly slice the table, and Bond, in half. Bond asks "Do you expect me to talk?" Goldfinger's reply is "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to ''die''!" Bond then bluffs his way out of impending death by telling Goldfinger that another Double-O agent will replace him and possesses the same information about Operation Grand Slam that Bond does. Goldfinger realizes that he cannot take the risk of a new unknown agent, and will have less trouble if he convinces Bond's superiors that Bond is doing well on the mission, meanwhile keeping Bond neutralized. He orders the laser to be shut down. Bond is shot with a [[tranquilizer dart]] and passes out.

Bond awakes aboard Goldfinger's private [[Lockheed JetStar]] aircraft, piloted by Pussy Galore. She tells Bond that they are en route to Goldfinger's Kentucky stud farm, near [[Fort Knox]]. During the flight, Pussy points a revolver at Bond; Bond lectures her that a .45 caliber bullet would explosively depressurize the cabin. In flight, he activates the [[homing device]] in the heel of his left shoe; Leiter detects its signal and informs M of 007's whereabouts.

On landing, Bond is imprisoned in the stud farm, where Goldfinger is meeting with representative U.S. mafiosi, who have delivered the operational materials he needs for Operation Grand Slam. In his cell, Bond overcomes his guard, escapes, and then spies on the gangster meeting, learning that Goldfinger intends to kill the soldiers of [[Fort Knox]] with Delta-9 nerve gas, and then (supposedly) steal the depository's gold; at lecture's end, a henchman gasses the gangsters. Goldfinger has lectured men he is about to kill, admitting to Bond that he did so, just for the pleasure of explaining to an audience what Goldfinger believes is the height of all criminal schemes ever to be attempted (comparing it with climbing Mt. Everest and splitting the atom).
[[Image:FortKnoxGoldVault.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Fort Knox]]]]
After the lecture, Bond manages to place a note on Goldfinger's plans, along with his small tracking device, in the pocket of an early-leaving gangster, Mr. Solo. However, this signal is lost when Solo is shot and killed in a car that is then crushed, with the gangster's cadaver inside, into a metal cube in an auto junkyard compactor. Meanwhile, Pussy Galore and guards re-capture Bond and returns him to his cell, now guarded by several Koreans to ensure he stays put.

Later, Bond and Goldfinger discuss the practical details of Operation Grandslam; Bond notes that the gold (10,500 tons) would take too long to steal; the U.S. military would have plenty of time to stop the theft. Goldfinger admits he does not intend to remove the gold, but instead plans to merely place into the depository a "dirty" "atomic device" (see [[salted bomb]]) supplied by the Red Chinese government. The bomb would irradiate the U.S.'s gold supply, rendering it useless for fifty-eight years, multiplying the value of Goldfinger's gold holdings at least tenfold. The ultimate purpose of this Communist plot is to disrupt the economy of the Western world.

As Operation Grandslam begins, the women pilots of Pussy Galore's Flying Circus gas metropolitan Fort Knox from the air, seemingly killing thousands of soldiers, civilians, and Felix Leiter and partner. 

All is not as it seems, however. Yet earlier, Bond had seduced Pussy Galore, unknowingly persuading her to contact the CIA, who have substituted a harmless gas in place of Delta-9. Goldfinger had deceived Galore to believe that Delta-9 was an anesthestic, not a nerve gas: she'd not planned mass murder and called the gas-dispersion operation "Operation Rock-A-Bye Baby." Bond had told her the truth about Delta-9, seemingly at the time without effect, but later commenting wryly that he must've "appealed to her maternal instincts". 

Goldfinger's communist Chinese destroy the depository's electrified gate with an explosive, then use the laser to cut their way into the vault building, and use a stolen combination to open the vault door. Bond is then handcuffed to the atomic bomb and lowered into the vault. Outside, the U.S. Army which had been faking death, revives to fight Goldfinger's communist forces; Goldfinger escapes the battle, disguised as a U.S. Army Colonel. 
[[Image:HaroldSakata007.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Odd Job]]
In the vault, Bond fights with and eventually kills Oddjob (whose lethal metal hat proves electrically fatal to him, as a conductor). Afterwards, Bond vainly tries to deactivate the atomic bomb; Leiter and an expert deactivate it seven seconds shy of detonation — the timer indicates 007.

Later, Bond is scheduled to meet the President for a personal, thank-you meeting; Bond's Washington, D.C.-bound flight in a government [[Lockheed JetStar]] (oddly similar to Goldfinger's) is hijacked by Goldfinger and Pussy Galore, who plan to escape in it to communist [[Cuba]]. Bond and Goldfinger struggle for the revolver, which fires, shatters a window, and begins to depressurise the cabin. Bond managed to hang on, but Goldfinger is sucked through the small window by the pressure. The damage causes the plane to go into a downward plunge which Pussy cannot stop. Before it crashes, however, Bond and Galore parachute from it and safely land on a tropical beach, to catch up on their kissing under cover of the parachute canopy.

{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}
[[Image:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Aston Martin DB5]]
*[[Aston Martin DB5]] - This car is Bond's first company car in the films, and is equipped with a number of Q Branch's modifications, including bulletproof front and rear windshields, oil slick dispenser, smoke screen, front machine guns, rotating licence plates, and a passenger ejector seat. This would later appear in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''.
*Homing beacons - Bond  is given two '''homing beacons''' from Q-branch.  The first is larger and used when Bond tracks the villain, Auric Goldfinger, to his base.  The second is smaller and allows [[MI6]] to know where Bond is.  Bond hides it in a secret compartment in the heel of his shoe.  Later, Bond removes it from the shoe and attempts to send a message to headquarters by wrapping the note around the transmitter and slipping it into someone's pocket.  The plan fails because the pocket's owner is killed and disposed of in a car crusher, which destroys the device.
*Attaché case - Reference is made to Bond having an [[attaché case]] that Bond is told was damaged (possibly destroyed) when examined by Goldfinger's personnel.
*[[Top hat]] weapon - [[Oddjob]], [[Auric Goldfinger|Goldfinger]]'s henchman, uses a special [[top hat]] with a metal disc under the brim as a throwing weapon.  The hat is capable of slicing through stone and metal when thrown hard enough. In the novel this weapon is a [[bowler hat]], but the movie version hat has a flat top.

==In popular culture==
* In an episode of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', when Will meets his new teacher, he shouts, "Were you the bad guy in Goldfinger?!"

* In the English [[Trip Hop]] group [[Sneaker Pimps]], the track "Golden Girl" was sampled on their 1996 song "[[6 Underground]]".

* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer to the Max]]," Homer sings a song to the tune of the "Goldfinger" title song (with similar lyrics) when he introduces himself to his family as "Max Power."

* In another ''The Simpsons'' episode, "[[You Only Move Twice]]", the scene with Bond and the laser is parodied. The end credits song about [[Hank Scorpio]] is based on the "Goldfinger" theme.

* In an episode of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', [[John Steed]] received a Christmas card from [[Cathy Gale]], who is apparently working at Fort Knox. Cathy Gale was played by Honor Blackman, who left ''The Avengers'' to work on ''Goldfinger''.

* In a first series episode of [[I'm Alan Partridge]], Alan sings the title song while walking down the dual-carriageway to the petrol station, with comic effect.

==''Mythbusters''==
Two controversial incidents in this film have been subjected to special examination by [[Discovery Channel]]'s program ''[[MythBusters]]'': skin asphyxiation and bullet-induced airplane explosive decompression. 

====Asphyxiation argument====
In one scene, the villain's girlfriend, Jill Masterson, is murdered by "skin suffocation." She is painted with gold paint and dies because her [[skin]] is unable to breathe. According to [[urban legend]], the concept was based on the death of a Swiss fashion model who painted herself and asphyxiated. Another urban legend in Europe involved Italian children who were painted gold as part of a religious parade, and died. Yet another urban legend suggested actress Shirley Eaton, the actress who portrayed Auric Goldfinger's doomed girlfriend, [http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/goldfing.htm died herself] while filming the scene from skin asphyxiation. 

''MythBusters'' has twice attempted to prove or disprove whether skin suffocation due to paint was possible. In both experiments one of the hosts of the series was covered head-to-toe in gold paint. The first experiment was called off when the subject began experiencing breathing and blood pressure problems. In a follow-up experiment, a different subject was covered but this time showed no ill effects. The series' conclusion was that if one did try murder via gilding, the victim would die of [[heat stroke]], but only after a long period and not in the manner shown in the movie. The gold paint would clog the pores and prevent [[perspiration]], rendering the body unable to properly regulate its temperature. Dying in this fashion, however, would take several days and is a very inefficient manner of killing.

===Explosive decompression airplane window argument===
In a 2003 episode of ''MythBusters'', the mythbusters attempted to recreate a scene in several movies (including ''Goldfinger'') in which a window in a jet at high altitude is broken by a bullet, resulting in a passenger being sucked through the window hole by the force of the decompression. The popular idea that this was a realistic possibility almost certainly<!--- {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Get serious, it was a mega-mega-hit, seen by millions who would have never thought of such a thing. Answer: what, do you want "certainly" instead?---> dates from the Goldfinger book and film (Bond in the film claims a .45 bullet fired at 35,000 feet will cause people to be sucked into "outer space"), and it had settled into the national consciousness firmly enough to be mentioned in the 1970 film ''[[Airport (film)|Airport]]'' (where a character tells of seeing this happen). 

''MythBusters''' attempted a recreation of the phenomenon by over-pressurizing a commercial airliner sitting on the ground to a differential of 8 p.s.i. (the normal pressure difference between inside and outside a commercial airliner at cruising altitude), then firing a handgun at the window. They were unable to re-create any kind of window blowout or sudden cabin decompression, using a firearm (instead, a small hole merely appeared in the plastic). Even when explosives were used to blow a window out entirely, a dummy passenger near the window stayed in the cabin. A claim was later made by the ''MythBusters'' team in a ''[[Skeptic Magazine]]'' interview, that the U.S. government had sought data from this particular segment, since federal agencies and their contractors had been seriously contemplating the same sort of tests, in relation to its armed sky-marshal program, after the events of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The Mythbusters tests found that 737 airliner windows apparently do not behave in the same way as the window in the [[Lockheed JetStar]] used to represent a jet at 35,000 ft in the film.
