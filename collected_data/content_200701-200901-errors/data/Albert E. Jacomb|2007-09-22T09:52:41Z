'''Albert E. Jacomb''' (c. [[1873]]–[[1946]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[printer (publisher)|printer]] and founding member of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]].

Originally with his brother Josiah, Jacomb ran a printing shop in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] where he produced much early SPGB literature, including the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'' from [[1904]] to [[1914]], as well as work for [[trade union]]s.

In [[1906]] the Jacomb brothers were involved in a scandal regarding the book ''[[Womanhood (book)|Womanhood]]'' which they printed and sold. Although this book probably dealt with [[contraception]] and the like, it was deemed [[obscene]] by the authorities. The brothers were arrested and charged with selling indecent literature.<ref>''The Times'', 4 October 1906</ref>

Jacomb wrote two Socialist Party pamphlets, ''Socialism'' ([[1920]]) and ''The Socialist Party: Its Principles and Policies'' ([[1934]]), and was a prolific writer for the ''[[Socialist Standard]]''. He was an Executive Committee member from [[1909]] to [[1919]] and was also on the Editorial Committee. At a local level he was branch secretary for [[East London, England|East London]] in [[1905]] and [[East Ham]] in [[1906]].

Towards the end of the [[1930s]] he came into conflict with the Party, primarily over the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Essentially Jacomb thought the Party should support the Republican side in a ‘war for democracy’. During the [[Second World War]] his differences became stronger, and in a letter of [[25 April]] [[1942]] he stated that he intended to publicly attack the SPGB as “a hindrance to the revolution”. This was too much and on [[30 June]] he was charged with action detrimental to the interests of the Party. The results of the party poll on his expulsion (207 votes in favour, 1 against) were announced on [[15 December]] [[1942]]. Subsequently he produced two pamphlets, ''AE Jacomb’s case against the Socialist Party'' and ''Jacomb Again''.

He died in [[1946]] aged 73.<ref>Obituary in the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'', November 1946</ref>
