'''Karnātakā''' {{audio|Karnataka.ogg|pronunciation}} ([[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ಕನಾ೯ಟಕ) ({{IPA2|kəɹnɑːʈəkɑː}}) is one of the four [[South India|southern]] [[States and territories of India|state]]s of [[India]]. The modern state of Karnataka came into existence with the passage of the ''[[States Reorganisation Act]]'' (1956), with the incorporation of districts under the dominion of [[Bombay (state)|Bombay]], [[Hyderabad (state)|Hyderabad]], [[Madras State]] and [[Coorg]] within the existing state of [[Mysore State]]. 

Karnataka's capital, [[Bengaluru]]/[[Bangalore]], is the capital city of the state with a population of more than 6 million. Other major cities include [[Mysore]], [[Mangalore]], [[Hubli-Dharwad]], [[Davanagere]], [[Bellary]], [[Hassan]], [[Shimoga]],[[Belagavi]] and [[Gadag]]. [[Kannada]] is the official language of the state. Karnataka is the [[List of states of India by area|8th largest Indian state by area]] and [[List of states of India by population|9th largest by population]].

==Origin of name==
{{main|Origin of Karnataka's name}}
Several [[etymology|etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka. One accepted derivative comes from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''nādu'' meaning ''elevated land'' (highest elevation 1500 ft.).  Another etymological derivative of the name comes from ''lear'' or ''black'' &mdash; a reference to the [[black soil|black cotton soil]] of the region.<ref>http://19.1911encyclopedia.org/C/CA/CARNATIC.htm</ref> 

During the [[British Raj]], the words ''Carnatic'' or ''Karnatak'' were used to describe this part of the region in general. Historically, the name ''[[Carnatic region]]'' applied to the regions below the [[Western Ghats]] ([[Coorg]] and [[Kerala]]) as well as regions in present day [[Andhra Pradesh]] ([[Telingana]]).<ref>http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V09_308.gif</ref> The 1956 [[Mysore state]] was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Karnataka}}
[[Image:Karnataka-districts-numbered with legend.png|thumb|200px|A map showing the 27 districts of Karnataka]]
<!--[[Image:Flag of Karnataka.svg|thumb|250px|The official flag of Karnataka]]-->
Karnataka is situated in the Deccan Plateau and is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the north, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the east and southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the southwest. It is situated at the angle where the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]] of South India converge into the [[Nilgiri|Nilgiri Hill]]s.

The state has three principal physical zones;
* The coastal strip, between the [[Western Ghats]] and the Arabian Sea, which is lowland, with moderate to high rainfall levels. This strip is around 320 km in length and 48-64 km wide.
* The [[Western Ghats]], a mountain range inland from the Arabian Sea, rising to about 900 m average height, and with moderate to high rainfall levels.
* The [[Deccan]] [[Plateau]], comprising the main inland region of the state, which is drier and verging on the semi-arid. The humidity in these plains or maidans never exceeds 50%.

Karnataka has one of the highest average elevations of Indian states at 1,500 feet. The highest recorded temperature was 45.6 C (114.08 F) at [[Raichur]] on May 23, 1928. The lowest recorded temperature was 2.8 C (37.04 F) at [[Bidar]] on December 16, 1918.<ref>{{cite web | title=Karnataka Temperatures | work=Karnataka.com Website | url=http://www.karnataka.com/profile/temperature.shtml | accessmonthday=July 20 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

;Cities and towns
Karnataka has around 20 major cities and hundreds of towns. Usually capital of a district is a city (of Population 100,000 -500,000) and taluq centres are towns (10,000-100,000) though there are exceptions. Major cities are [[Bangalore]], [[Mangalore]], [[Mysore]], [[Belgaum]], [[Gulbarga]] and [[Hubli-Dharwad]].

==History==
<!--[[Image:Belur4.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hoysala Empire]] architecture in [[Belur]].]]-->
[[Image:GolGumbaz2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gol Gumbaz]] is the mausoleum of Muhammad Adil Shah II (1627-57) of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Indian sultans, who ruled the Sultanate of Bijapur from 1490 to 1686.The structure consists of a massive square chamber measuring nearly 50 m on each side and covered by a huge dome 37.9 m in diameter making it one of the largest domes in the world.]]
{{main|History of Karnataka}} {{main|The great Karnataka Expansion}}

Evidence of [[Neolithic]] habitation of areas in modern Karnataka and [[celt (tool)|celt]]s dating back to the 2nd century [[Before Common Era|BCE]] were first discovered in 1872 CE. There are reports that a polished [[stone axe]] was discovered at Lingsugur in the [[Raichur district]]; however the authenticity of these reports remains unverifiable.<ref name="Hindu.com 2005011001090500">http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/10/stories/2005011001090500.htm</ref> [[Megalithic]] structures one of them of [[Gomateshwara]] is considered to be the monument of Ganga period and burial grounds were discovered in 1862 CE in the regions of [[Kodagu]] and [[Moorey Betta]] hills, while [[Neolithic]] sites were discovered in north Karnataka. 

Scholarly hypothesis postulates of contacts between the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] city of [[Harappa]] in 3000 BCE, citing the discovery of gold found in the Harappan sites that was imported from mines in Karnataka.<ref>http://metalrg.iisc.ernet.in/~wootz/heritage/K-hertage.htm</ref><ref>http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka7.htm</ref><ref>http://www.ancientindia.co.uk/staff/resources/background/bg16/home.html</ref><ref>http://www.hindunet.org/saraswati/html/artefacts.htm</ref>In the third century BCE, most of Karnataka was part of the [[Mauryan Empire]], ruled by [[Ashoka|Emperor Ashoka]]. Rock [[edict]]s of Ashoka, written in [[Prakrit]], were discovered in [[Chitradurga]] and Raichur. In the [[4th century BCE]], the [[Satavahana]] dynasty came to power and its rule lasted nearly 3 centuries. 

The disintegration of the Satavahana dynasty led to the ascent of the first native kingdoms, the [[Banavasi]] [[Kadambas]](325-540 CE) from [[Uttara Kannada]] region, and the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] (325-550 CE) in southern Karnataka. These were the first kingdoms to give administrative status to Kannada language as evidenced by the [[Halmidi inscription]] of 450 CE, attributed to King [[Kakusthavarma]] of the [[Kadamba Dynasty]]. Also, recent discovery of 5th century CE copper coin in [[Banavasi]], ancient capital of the [[Kadambas]], with [[Kannada script]] inscription on it, further proves the usage of Kannada at an official level.<ref>{{cite web

Nripa Kama established the [[Hoysala Empire]] at the turn of the millennium. Art and architecture flourished in the region during the time that resulted in the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the ''Vesara'' style of architecture.  The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought large parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under their rule.<ref name="arbiters">The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] city of Kannanur Kuppam near [[Srirangam]] became the second capital of the Hoysalas during the rule of [[Vira Narasimha II]]. During the time of [[Veera Ballala III]], Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu had been made an alternate capital, from where the Hoysala fought the Sultan of Madurai. The Hoysalas were regarded as practically the arbiters of [[South Indian]] politics. With the waning of Chola and Pandya power, the Hoysalas took up the leadership role in the South India, according to Prof. B.S.K. Iyengar, ''A Concise History of Karnataka'', Dr. S.U. Kamath. The Hoysala rule saw the consolidation and domination of Southern [[Deccan]] as a single empire, Dr. Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India''</ref>

In early 14th century the Vijayanagara empire with its capital at Hosapattana (later to be called [[Vijayanagara]]) rose to successfully challenge the Muslim invasions into the South.  This empire was established by Harihara and Bukka Raya, commanders of the last Hoysala King [[Veera Ballala|Veera Ballala III]].
The [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani sultans]] of [[Gulbarga]] and the [[Adil Shahi]] sultans of [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] ruled over the region after the defeat and disintegration of the Vijayanagara Empire in battle at Talikota. The Bahamani rulers encouraged [[Urdu]] and Persian literature and [[Islamic architecture]]. The [[Gol Gumbaz]] was constructed during this time. With the defeat of the Bahmani sultans, the entire region came into the dominion of the [[Mughal Empire]].

[[Image:Mysorepalace.jpg|thumb|250px|Mysore Palace]]The [[Wodeyar]]s of Mysore, former vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire, leased the state from the Mughal king [[Aurangzeb]] in the 15th century CE. With the death of [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar II]], [[Haidar Ali]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Mysore Army, assumed control over the region, until the rule of the kingdom was passed to [[Tippu Sultan]], after Haidar Ali's death. 

In attempting to contain [[Europe]] an expansion in South India, Tippu Sultan, known as the Tiger of Mysore fought four significant [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]], the last of which resulted in his death and the incorporation of Mysore into the [[British Raj]] in 1799 AD.  

After Indian independence, the [[Wodeyar]] Maharaja acceded to India. In [[1950]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] became an Indian state, and the former Maharaja became its [[Rajpramukh]], head of state, until 1975 CE. 

The [[Unification of Karnataka|Ekikarana movement]] started in the late 19th century and culminated in the formation of Karnataka state in 1956, nine years after [[Indian independence|independence]].  The [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956 provided for parts of [[Coorg]], [[Madras State|Madras]], [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], and [[Bombay state]]s to be incorporated into the state of Mysore. Mysore state was renamed Karnataka in 1973.  The state of Mysore was formed on [[November 1]] [[1956]] and since then [[November 1]] of every year is celebrated as [[Kannada Rajyotsava]] / [[Karnataka Rajyotsava]].

==Government and administration==
[[Image:Soudha.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Vidhana Soudha]] is the seat of Karnataka's [[Legislative assembly]]]]
{{main|Unification of Karnataka|Government of Karnataka}}
Karnataka took its present shape in [[1956]], when the states of [[Mysore state|Mysore]] and [[Coorg]] (Kodagu) were merged with the Kannada-speaking districts of the former states of [[Bombay state|Bombay]] and [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], and [[Madras State|Madras]]. Mysore state was made up of ten districts, Bangalore, Kolar, Tumkur, Mandya, Mysore, Hassan, Chikmagalur (Kadur), Shimoga and Chitradurga; [[Bellary]] had been transferred from [[Madras]] state to Mysore in 1953, when the new state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] was created out of Madras' northern districts. Kodagu became a district, and [[Dakshina Kannada]] (South Kanara) district was transferred from Madras state, [[North Kanara]], [[Dharwad]], [[Belgaum District]], and [[Bijapur District]]  from Bombay state, and [[Bidar District]], [[Gulbarga District]], and [[Raichur District]] from Hyderabad state.

In 1989 Bangalore Rural district was split from Bangalore. and in 1997 Bagalkot district split from Bijapur, Chamrajnagar district split from Mysore, Gadag district split from Dharwad, Haveri district split from Dharwad, Koppal district split from Raichur, Udupi district split from Dakshina Kannada, and Davanagere district was created from parts of Bellary, Chitradurga, Dharwad, and Shimoga.

;Administration
For administrative purposes, Karnataka has been divided into 27 districts grouped under four divisions - the ''Mysore'', ''Bengaluru'', ''Gulbarga'' and ''Hubli-Dharwad'' divisions.  Government administration under the Indian constitution is divided into three main arms – the legislative, executive and judicial.  The Karnataka legislature has two houses: upper and lower. Lower house members are elected directly from people. Some of the upper house members are elected by assembly, some are elected by special category of people like teachers and graduates and some are nominated by governor. Each house has a speaker. Chief minister and his cabinet are selected from among the members of both houses.

The executive is headed by [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy commissioners]] or District magistrates in each of the 28 districts.  These officers belong to the [[Indian Administrative Service]]. The district magistrate or the deputy commissioner is assisted by a number of officers belonging to Karnataka Civil Service and other Karnataka state services.

A [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Police Service]] is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining law and order and related issues of the district. He is assisted by the officers of the Karnataka Police Service and other Karnataka Police officials.  Apart from these, a [[Deputy Conservator of Forests (India)|Deputy Conservator of Forests]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Forest Service]] also serves the government.  Sectoral development is looked after by the district head of each development department such as PWD, Health, Education, Agriculture, Animal husbandry, etc. These officers belong to the various State Services.

The judiciary is headquartered at Bangalore where the ''Attaara Kacheri'' houses the Karnataka High court.  There are courts in every district centres and some taluq centres.

[[Image:Bangalore_HighCourt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Karnataka High Court]], also called "Attara Kacheri" (which once housed the original "Eighteen Departments"), is the supreme judicial body in Karnataka and is located in Bangalore.]]

;Politics
{{Main|Karnataka Politics}}
Karnataka politics is dominated by Congress and Janata Parties (like Janata Dal). Current chief minister is H.D.Kumarasamy, son of former Prime minister H.D.Deve Gowda, from a splinter group of Janata Dal. [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] is also part of the government and the deputy chief minister , B.S.Yediyurappa is from this party..

==Language==
{{see also |Kannada language |Tulu |Konkani |Kodava |Beary}}
Language was the main basis for the formation of the Indian states after independence and the present day Karnataka was formed by unifying majority Kannada-speaking regions from the many districts of erstwhile [[Madras State]] (present day [[Tamil Nadu]]), erstwhile Bombay presidency (present day [[Maharashtra]]) and the erstwhile princely state of Hyderabad (present day [[Andhra Pradesh]]) to the former [[Kingdom of Mysore]], known as the [[Mysore State]] (post independence) around the years 1950-1957. In 1973, the [[Mysore State]] was officially christened as Karnataka. [[Kannada]], [[Kodava Takk]], [[Konkani]] and [[Tulu language|Tulu]] are written in the [[Kannada script]] though Tulu has its own script. There are efforts to promote Tulu script.

'''Literature and inscriptions''' 
{{See also|Kannada literature|Karnataka literature|Rashtrakuta literature|Western Chalukya literature|Hoysala literature|Vijayanagara Empire Literature}} 	 
The earliest full length Kannada language inscription in ''Hale Kannada'' script is the [[Halmidi]] Inscription of 450CE.<ref name="Oldest inscription">A report on Halmidi inscription, {{cite web|title=Halmidi village finally on the road to recognition |url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/11/03/stories/2003110304550500.htm|author=Muralidhara Khajane |publisher=The Hindu|work=The Hindu, Monday, November 03, 2003 |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> 	 			
[[Kannada]] has had an unbroken literary tradition of at least 1500 years. Though the earliest extant book on Kannada literature is ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' 850 AD, references made in this book refer back to early Kannada literature of 6th century.<ref name="6century">Dr. Nilakanta Sastri, K.A., ''A History of South India'', p355</ref> The earliest extant poetry in ''tripadi'' meter are the [[Kappe Arabhatta]] records of 700 AD.<ref name="poetry">Dr. S.U.Kamath, ''A Concise history of Karnataka'', p67</ref> Literature in [[Kannada]] has been prolific ever since. Some early extinct works are ''Chudamani'' (a 96,000 verse-measures), a commentary on logic ''Tatwarthamahashastra'' by Tambuluruacharya of 650 AD, ''Prabhrita'' by Syamakundacharya of 650 AD,<ref name="earlyworks">According to R. Narasimhacharya, ''History of Kannada Literature'', p4</ref> ''Karnateshwara Katha'' with [[Pulakesi II]] as its hero from the 7th century and ''Gajastaka'' a work on elephant management by king Shivamara II of [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] of the 8th century.<ref name="early_works">Dr. Suryanath. U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka'', p50, p67</ref> [[Vachana]] sahitya and [[Haridasa]] sahitya are two unique contributions of Kannada to the world of devotional literature. 	 
Modern Kannada in twentieth century has been influenced by many movements. Notable among them are Navodaya, Navya, Dalita/Bandaya. Presently Kannada literature is ahead of all other languages in [[India]] with seven [[Jnanpith award]]s, the highest literary honour in India. Writers in Kannada have also bagged forty eight Sahitya Academy awards. 	 
		 
Some [[inscription]]s in the [[Tulu language]] are found in and around the [[village]] of [[Barkur]].The ruins and inscriptions are in need of being preserved.

==Transportation==
;Air transport
[[Image:flykingfisher.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A Toyota F1 car sponsored by [[Kingfisher Airlines]], which is based in Bangalore, Karnataka]]

''For a list of flights operating out of cities in Karnataka, please see the article: [[List_of_Destinations_to/from_all_Karnataka_Airports|Destinations to/from all Karnataka airports]]''

[[Mangalore]] and [[Bangalore]] are the only two cities in the state that have International flights operating from their airports. While the international flights from [[Mangalore]] are only to countries located in the [[Middle East]], [[Bangalore]] has good international connectivity with flights from different nations landing here. The airport at Bangalore is termed as [[HAL Airport]] and [[Lufthansa]], [[British Airways]], [[Singapore Airlines]] and [[Malaysian Airlines]] are some of the important airlines that operate out of this airport. With Bangalore being the 'IT capital' of India, the air traffic to this city has increased manifold. The existing HAL airport does not have sufficient infrastructure to handle this increase in air traffic, and hence a new airport (currently called as [[Bangalore_International_Airport_Limited|Bangalore International Airport]]) is being constructed at [[Devanahalli]] in the outskirts of [[Bangalore]]. This airport is expected to be operational by April 2008.

Bangalore is the headquarters of the low-cost airline [[Air Deccan]] which has been instrumental in opening up the previously unused airports of [[Hampi]], [[Bellary]], [[Hubli]] and [[Belgaum]] to passenger air traffic. It is also the headquarters of [[Kingfisher Airlines]]. [[Mysore]] is one of the major cities in Karnataka that is lacking an airport.

;Rail transport
Karnataka does not have a good internal rail network though the South Western Railway's headquarters are located here in the city of [[Hubli]]<ref name="rail"> The state of Railways in Karnataka is discussed by {{cite web|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/issues/karnataka_railways.htm|author=GS Prasanna Kumar|title=Karnataka and Indian Railways, Colossal wastage of available resources or is it sheer madness of the authorities concerned|work=Online webpage of OurKarnataka.com|publisher=© 1998-00 OurKarnataka.Com,Inc|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref>. Only [[Bangalore]] is connected well by trains to other cities in [[India]]. [[Mangalore]], one of the major towns in [[Karnataka]] has no trains to other major cities like [[Bangalore]], [[Mysore]] and [[Hubli]]. Metre gauges tracks from [[Shimoga]] to Talguppa and [[Mysore]] to [[Chamarajanagar]] have still to be converted to broad gauge. District capitals like [[Chikkamagaluru]] and [[Madikeri]] are not connected by a rail network. Proposals to lay new tracks that would have been hugely beneficial to the state like those between [[Hubli]] - [[Ankola]], [[Kadur]] - [[Sakleshpur]], [[Chamarajanagar]] - [[Mettupalayam]] and Talguppa - [[Konkan Railway]] have remained as proposals. Even doubling of the track between [[Bangalore]] and [[Mysore]] is yet to be completed. Though the state has [[Konkan Railway]] within it; it has remained isolated with no trains running from other parts of the state to places that exist on the [[Konkan Railway]].

;Water transport
Karnataka has 20 ports, of these [[Mangalore]] and [[Karwar]] are the biggest and most important. The [[New Mangalore port]] is currently the 9th busiest in India in terms of Cargo handled. Karwar is currently set to become the largest naval base in Asia with the completion of [[Project Seabird]] which will result in the naval base [[INS Kadamba]]. The deep water port at INS Kadamba will have more than 50 berths and will be able to accommodate India's aircraft carriers. The port shall also have a new ship lift, the first of its kind in Asia which will enable the navy to repair her ships on land.

;Bus transport
The [[Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation]] (KSRTC) was set up in the year 1961 with 1792 buses and is wholly owned by the Government of Karnataka. The Government of [[India]] is also a shareholder in this corporation. The total transportable road is 9590 km. and connected by N.H.-13 nationwide, it is 3967 km. from Delhi. The KSRTC operates its services to all the villages in the state which have motorable roads. The corporation serves over 2.2 million passengers on a daily basis.

Till August 1997, KSRTC was holding a fleet of 10,400 buses, operating about 9500 schedules. In August 1997, KSRTC was divided and a new corporation by the name [[Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation]] (BMTC) was carved out of KSRTC. Currently, the KSRTC operates 5400 buses with 5100 different schedules, and employs over 25,000 people. The KSRTC is also the only state run bus corporation that is profitable.

In November 1997, another new road transport corporation called North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) was formed to cater to the transportation needs of North Western parts of Karnataka. Recently, the North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC) was also formed with its corporate office in [[Gulbarga]].

:''Main article'' [[Carnatic Music]]
The Kannada haridasa movement sowed the seeds of this art in the 13th-15th century AD. With the rise of [[Vaishnavism]] and the [[Haridasa]] movement came Karnataka composers like [[Purandaradasa]], whose Kannada language works were complex, devotional and philosophical. Other haridasas of medeval times were [[Kanakadasa]], [[Vyasatirtha]], [[Jayatirtha]], [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vadirajatirtha]] and others who composed several ''devara nama''. One of the earliest and prominent composers in South India was the saint, and wandering divine singer of yore [[Purandara Dasa]] (1480-1564 AD). Purandara Dasa is believed to have composed 475,000 songs in [[Kannada]] and was a source of inspiration to the later composers like [[Tyagaraja]]. He also invented the tala system of [[Carnatic]] music. Owing to his contribution to the Carnatic Music he is referred to as the ''Father of Carnatic Music'' or ''Karnataka Sangeeta Pitaamaha''. 
Later in the 17th and 18th centuries, the haridasa movement would once again contribute to music in Karnataka the form of haridasas like Vijayadasa, Gopaladasa, Jagannathadasa and others.

Karnataka has played a very important role in shaping present day Indian religion and philosophy.  The three most important schools of Hindu philosophy, ''[[Advaita]]'', ''[[Dvaita]]'' and ''[[Vishistadvaita]]'' blossomed in Karnataka.  While [[Madhvacharya]](1238-1317 AD) was born and belonged to Karnataka, [[Adi Shankaracharya]] chose [[Sringeri]] in Karnataka to set up the first of his four ''mathas''.  [[Ramanujacharya]] who fled persecution at the hands of a Shaivaite Chola king also settled down in [[Melkote]] in Karnataka,<ref name="persecution">Fearing persecution by the Cholas who were staunch [[Shaiva]], Ramanujacharya came to Karnataka in [[1098]] and lived there till [[1122]] C.E. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana temple and a well organised [[Matha]] were built. Hoysala Vishnuvardhana became his devotee and converted from Jainism to Hinduism. This helped popularise his Vishva adviata philosophy in the region, ''A Concise History of Karnataka'', Dr. S.U. Kamath, ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', by Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri</ref> which is today a fountainhead of the Vishishtadvaita faith.  

Following these developments, [[Veerashaivism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste systems.  Leading figures of the movement such as [[Basavanna|Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]] established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] where the philosophy of ''[[Veerashaivism|Shakti Vishishtadvaita]]'' was expounded.  This was to form the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith and today counts millions among its followers.   

The [[Jainism|Jaina]] faith also has its fountainhead in Karnataka.  [[Rishabhadeva]] is said to have spent his final days in Karnataka.  Both Jain philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka.  The Jain influence on literature and philosophy is particularly evident in the literatures of Kannada and Tamil.

Islam gained a foothold in Karnataka with the arrival of the Bahamani sultans who ruled Karnataka and many other parts of southern India following the fall of the [[Vijayanagar]] empire.  Christianity reached Karnataka in the 16th century with the arrival of the Portuguese.  Today, both Islam and Christianity have a sizeable following in Karnataka and have contributed richly to the cultural cosmopolitanism of the state.  Buddhism also thrives in Karnataka.  Karnataka is home to the Dzogchen monastery and the Dhondeling Tibetan refugee camps.

[[Udupi]], [[Sringeri]], [[Gokarna]] and [[Melkote]] are well known places of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] learning. [[Shravanabelagola]], [[Mudabidri]], [[Karkala]] are famous for Jain history and monuments.  

<!--===Temples===
{{See also|Badami Chalukya Architecture|Hoysala architecture|Vijayanagar Architecture}}
The Empires and Kingdoms that came to rule from Karnataka were prolific builders. The [[Badami]] [[Chalukyas]] spawned the ''[[Vesara]]'' style of architecture and experimented with several myriad styles with frequent intermixing of ''Nagara'' and [[Dravida]] concepts. This period is the beginning of Hindu rock cut architecture, both in stand alone and [[cave]] temple idioms, numerous examples of which exist in [[Pattadakal]], [[Aihole]] and [[Badami]] - ([[Badami Cave temple]]). Their successors, the [[Rashtrakuta]] created master piece temples further favoring [[Indian architecture#Hindu architecture|Dravidian]] concepts. Most of their temples in Karnataka are scattered over northern Karnataka districts.
The [[Ganga Dynasty]] of [[Talakad]] built many Jaina monuments including the monolithic statue of Gomateshwara at [[Shravanabelagola]]. The [[Western Chalukyas]] used the ''In-between'' style, implying a bridge between Chalukya - Rashtrakuta  and [[Hoysala]] styles, with the best temples of their style located in the central districts of [[Gadag district]], [[Koppal district]] and [[Haveri district]]. It was during the reign of the Hoysalas that the temple architecture reached its epoch and gained recognition as an independent style called (Henry Ferguson, Percy Brown) owing to its many unique features. Later the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] would incorporate all these various styles and create a unique blend called Vijayanagar style,
the best examples of which are in the vast open air theater of monuments at [[Hampi]].
