The '''Battle of Baia''', which took place on the [[15 December]] [[1467]], was an important battle in the history of [[medieval]] [[Moldavia]]. The battle was a confrontation between the [[Moldavia|Moldavian]] prince [[Stephen the Great]] and [[Mathias Corvinus]], [[List of Hungarian rulers|Hungarian king]].

The (immediate) cause of the battle was the taking of the Hungarian controlled fortress of [[Kilia|Chilia]] by Moldavian forces. Mathias Corvinus reacted by launching a military expedition against [[Moldavia]]. The main Hungarian army, unaware of the trap set out for them, entered Moldavia and headed for the city of [[Baia]]. The Moldavians set fire to the city on the night of [[15 December]], and then charged the main Hungarian army. 

The Hungarian side suffered extensive casualties. Mathias Corvinus himself was wounded by three arrows. At the beginning of the battle the Hungarian army was estimated to have numbered about 40,000, the Moldavians about 12,000.
