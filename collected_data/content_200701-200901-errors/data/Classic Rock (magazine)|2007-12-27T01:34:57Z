'''''Classic Rock''''' is a [[magazine]] dedicated to the radio format of [[classic rock]], published by [[Future Publishing]], who are also responsible for its "sister" publication ''[[Metal Hammer]]''. Although firmly focusing on key bands from the 1960s through early 1990s, such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Free (band)|Free]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Status Quo]],[[AC/DC]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Metallica]] and [[The Who]], it also includes articles and reviews of contemporary and upcoming artists it deems worthy of note, such as [[The Answer (band)|The Answer]] and [[Wolfmother]]. Despite starting as a one-off project it has become one of the UK's best selling music magazines, and attracts much attention and respect of many of classic rock's biggest names. It recently published its 100th issue.


==Beginnings==
''Classic Rock'' was an idea formulated by ex-''Metal Hammer'' Deputy Editor Jerry Ewing (subsequently Editor of ''Classic Rock''), along with ''Metal Hammer'' colleague Dave Ling and art editor Andy Ryan at Dennis Publishing. They suggested a one-off title dedicated to classic rock. They felt it was neglected in publication and would attract a large audience. In 1998 original publishers Dennis Publishing allegedly begrudgingly authorised the first issue of ''Classic Rock'' featuring [[Guns N' Roses]] and including an article by [[Mick Wall]], a journalist who became something of a renowned name when [[Axl Rose]] insulted him on the track "[[Get in the Ring]]" on ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]''. It sold better than expected and was continued. Wall is one of six writers, along with Ewing and Ling who where involved in that publication and still write for the magazine today. The magazine attracted a niche audience initially but sales grew as ''Classic Rock'' featured artists such as [[Black Sabbath]]. [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Aerosmith]] on its cover in the first year. It attracted those who saw mainstream music publications such as ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' and ''[[NME]]'' to be stale, and too focused on discovering the "next big thing". It also came at a time when the charts were even more dominated by pop bands than usual, as record companies seemed unwilling to risk money on bands who wrote their own material. ''Classic Rock'' soon became a regular fixture in newsagents the UK, Ireland and Europe, and now publishes 13 issues a year.

==Key Acts==
The magazine focuses on established bands with credentials dating back to the 1960's. Indeed, many of the artists who have appeared on its cover are deceased ([[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Phil Lynott]] of [[Thin Lizzy]] featured on early covers, as did bands with deceased members such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[The Who]]). 
Acts to have appeared on the front cover 3 times or more to date include [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Black Sabbath]] / [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Led Zeppelin]] ([[Jimmy Page]] has been on the cover on his own right 3 times), [[Metallica]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Mötley Crüe]]. More recent acts to have been on the cover include [[The Darkness]] and despite only having released one album to date, [[Velvet Revolver]] have been on it twice, though it comprised of members well known to ''Classic Rock'' enthusiasts, such as [[Slash (musician)|Slash]].
Despite the dominating nature of acts undeniably falling into the category of classic rock, the magazine takes an inclusive attitude to its genre and is happy to include [[heavy metal]], [[progressive rock|prog rock]], [[blues]] and [[grunge music|grunge]] acts. Recent features have included [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]], and are happy to review acts as diverse as [[Porcupine Tree]], [[Buckcherry]] and [[Rodrigo y Gabriela]]. Monthly updates on '[[sleaze rock|sleaze]]' and prog releases are a regular feature.

==Contemporary Acts==
''Classic Rock'' review any release that even comes close to being classified as rock, including albums, DVDs, concerts and books. It includes an annual award for best new band. Acts such as [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[DragonForce]], [[Wolfmother]] and [[The Answer (band)|The Answer]] have all been featured in recent months, indeed The Answer's debut album ''[[Rise (The Answer album)|Rise]]'' received rave reviews.

==100 Greatest British Albums==
For the 91st issue ([[April]], [[2006]]), the magazine presented 'The 100 Greatest [[Great Britain|British]] Rock Albums Ever', which were voted for by ''Classic Rock'' staff and various people associated with rock music (including [[Glenn Hughes]] of [[Deep Purple]] and [[Black Sabbath]] fame, [[Lemmy]] of [[Motörhead]] and [[Francis Rossi]] of [[Status Quo]]). The magazine decided to let [[AC/DC]] be classed as a British act, although the band was formed in [[Australia]]. Two of the band's singers ([[Bon Scott]] and [[Brian Johnson]]) and guitarists [[Angus Young|Angus]] and [[Malcolm Young]] are British. Led Zeppelin's ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' reached first place.

==100th Issue==
The 100th issue, quite a landmark considering the haphazard nature of the magazine's origin, contained all the regular features, but only one article, in which 100 names in rock were asked to write a piece on their nomination for a "rock icon". Contributors included such notable figures as [[Brian May]], Lemmy (who nominated [[Tina Turner]], who was then himself nominated by Ian Camfield) [[Ian Gillan]], [[Gary Moore]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Sebastian Bach]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Jerry Cantrell]], [[Chris Cornell]], [[Paul Rodgers]], [[Chad Smith]], [[Jack Black]], [[Zakk Wylde]] and [[Matt Bellamy]].

==Special Issues==
''Classic Rock'' has also published, in conjunction with ''Metal Hammer'', special decade issues featuring 70s (Issue I), 80s (Issue II), and 90s (Issue III) hard rock and metal bands, throughout 2006. In 2007, three special editions were also published with bonus DVDs for £7.50. These each focussed on one genre of rock music - first blues rock (Issue I), then progressive rock (Issue II), and finally, heavy metal (Issue III). A special 2007 collectors edition ''bookazine'' was produced entitled "High Voltage", featuring stories by Mick Wall and photographs by [[Ross Halfin]] on Jimmy Page, Ozzy Osbourne, Axl Rose et al. This issue replaced the regular Christmas/Winter issues from previous years.
