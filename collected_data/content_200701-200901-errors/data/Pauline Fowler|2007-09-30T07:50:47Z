'''Pauline Fowler''' ([[Married and maiden names|née]] '''Beale''')<ref name="profile">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_pauline_f.shtml|title=EastEnders character Pauline Fowler|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]||accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref> is a [[fictional character]] in the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played continuously by actress [[Wendy Richard]].<ref name="gone">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5165860.stm|title=Wendy Richard to leave EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[10 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> Her first appearance in ''EastEnders'' was on [[19 February]] [[1985]], the show's first episode; she remained on-screen for twenty-one years and ten months. Pauline Fowler is the second longest-running character in the programme's history, surpassed only by [[Adam Woodyatt]]'s character, [[Ian Beale]]. 

Pauline was depicted as the matriarchal stalwart of the fictional London community of [[Albert Square]]. Quintessentially [[working-class]], her storylines focused on drudgery, money worries and family troubles, which were all confronted with steely determination and stoicism—traits that consistently typified the character. She was most often portrayed as an opinionated, sombre, battle-axe—a family-oriented woman who often alienated her kin due to overbearing interference. 

Pauline's marriage to the downtrodden [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] was central to the character for the first eleven years of the programme, ending with his screen death in 1996. Pauline was often featured with another long running character, fellow launderette colleague, [[Dot Branning]]; their scenes were generally used for comedic purposes. Her narrative also included many feuds, most notably with her daughter-in-law, [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]], and [[Den Watts]]; a family-friend who got her daughter [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]] pregnant at just 16. Actress Wendy Richard announced her character's retirement from the serial in 2006. Pauline was killed off in a "[[whodunnit]]?" murder storyline,<ref>{{cite news|title=EastEnders set for another murder plot?|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0115/eastenders.html|publisher=''RTÉ Entertainment''|date=[[15 January]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref> and made her final appearance on Christmas Day, [[25 December]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Vicar of Dibley tops Christmas TV viewing|url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=1915232006|publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]''|date=[[26 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref>

During her time in ''EastEnders'', Pauline evoked both praise and criticism from viewers and the British media—she has been described as a [[Cultural icon|television icon]], but also as the "Wicked Witch of Walford". Away from the on-screen serial, Pauline has been the subject of television documentaries, behind-the-scenes books, fictional tie-in novels and comedy sketch shows.
== Character creation ==
===Background===
Pauline Fowler was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Holland had drawn on his own London background for inspiration, naming some of the characters after his cousins, the fraternal twins Pete and Pauline and their mother Lou; a family set-up recreated on-screen as the first family of ''EastEnders'', [[The Beale/Fowler family|the Beales and Fowlers]].<ref name="insidestory">{{cite book|last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink=Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title=[[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders—The Inside Story]]|year=1987|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-20601-2|pages=49—50}}</ref>

Pauline's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''.

{{cquote|[[Pete Beale|Pete]]'s twin sister. Forty, and a chip off the [[Lou Beale]] block. Plucky, and determined to battle through whatever the odds. A warm, practical, unsophisticated woman: you stand by your man, do your duty, fight for your kids and have a roast for [[Sunday dinner]] … She's also pregnant … She actually remembers her dad [Albert] saying ''"Two things we don't discuss in this house are religion and politics".'' She also remembers her dad smoked a pipe, and wishes her husband did too. She loved her dad very much … Maybe she didn't go into her marriage with quite the right spirit? She was due to be chief bridesmaid at her sister's wedding but she'd got [[influenza|the flu]] and was confined to bed. Arthur, someone she'd known from school, was given permission to visit the invalid upstairs. He found himself proposing to her. Years later he said ''"It was to cheer her up really."'' And Pauline found herself accepting too … She's very fond of her twin brother, Pete (and knows that he's mum's favourite). She's very conventional, and the salt of the earth. Jolly, rounded, someone you can get your arms round. She doesn't trust skinny people…<ref>Smith, Julia; Holland, Tony pp. 53—54</ref>}}

===Casting===
From the beginning, Smith had considered the role would be ideal for [[Wendy Richard]], who she had worked with on the 1960s BBC soap ''[[The Newcomers (TV series)|The Newcomers]]''. In fact, Richard has since claimed that the part was created especially for her.<ref name="titbits">{{cite news|url=http://pages.prodigy.net/glc/wrhp/html/wr_wat85.htm |title=Heartbreak Behind Wendy's TV Role|publisher=''Weekend and Titbits''|date=[[14 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> Holland and Smith decided to approach her about the role, even though their casting policy was not to use “stars”—Richard was already well known in the UK for playing glamorous roles, such as [[List of Are You Being Served? characters#Miss Shirley Brahms|Shirley Brahms]] in the successful sitcom ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' There were initial fears that Richard’s glamorous image would not work for the character and Richard has since commented “When I arrived to talk about [the role], I realised Julia had got an image of how I could be, but it conflicted with everyone else's image of me so far”. Smith also feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age. In an interview in 1985, Richard stated: “I’m in my 25th year in show business, I can't go on playing dolly birds forever…I took this job to prove something."<ref>{{cite news|title=Why It's So Worthwhile For Wendy|url=http://pages.prodigy.net/glc/wrhp/html/wr_de85.htm|publisher=''[[Daily Express]]''|date=[[3 October]] [[1985]]|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref><ref name="insidestory2">Smith, Julia; Holland, Tony pp. 129—130</ref> 

Richard was subsequently cast as Pauline and she was given a make over to make her appearance more in keeping with Pauline’s unglamorous lifestyle. Richard has said “Having my hair cut was the most traumatic aspect of joining EastEnders. I'd worn it long for 19 years. I was hysterical when I came out of the hairdresser's. Then someone said I looked like [[Judith Chalmers]]!”<ref name="titbits"/> Richard's casting was considered to be "a giant leap of faith" by Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately "landed on its feet",<ref name="insidestory2"/> because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in ''EastEnders''' history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.

==Character development and impact==
===Lineage and personality===
The character of Pauline was a [[wiktionary:cornerstone|cornerstone]] of ''EastEnders'' for the first 22 years of its existence; the [[linchpin]] of the Fowler/Beale family around which the soap was originally structured. At the beginning of the ''EastEnders'' serial in 1985, Pauline was shown to be a working wife–attendant at the local launderette–with two teenage children–daughter Michelle ([[Susan Tully]]) and eldest son Mark (played originally by [[David Scarboro]] but later recast to [[Todd Carty]] in 1990), and another child on the way. The fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind-the-scenes books such as ''EastEnders: The Inside Story'', and also the second tie-in novel by [[Hugh Miller (writer)|Hugh Miller]], ''Swings and Roundabouts.'' The books firmly linked the character to the area in which the soap is set; born and raised at [[45 Albert Square]]—where she lived for her entire life—marrying Arthur Fowler in 1965 and raising her own children in the same house.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Hugh|authorlink=Hugh Miller (writer)|title=[[EastEnders books#Novels|EastEnders—Book Two: Swings and Roundabouts]]|year=1986|pages=69|publisher=Inner Circle Books|id=ISBN 1-85018-050-4}}</ref> 

As the serial progressed, Pauline altered somewhat from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the show's early years, she became a sombre "[[wiktionary:battle-ax|battle-axe]]", hardened by a life of misery in [[Albert Square]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/eastenders/Eastenders+Pauline+Fowler+to+be+Killed+off+at+Christmas-20368.html|title=Eastenders Pauline Fowler to be Killed off at Christmas|publisher=Femalefirst.co.uk|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> She was once described as "the [[Boadicea]] of battle-axes."<ref name="tee">{{cite news|url=http://icteesside.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/columnists/mondayinterview/tm_objectid=15205494&method=full&siteid=50080&headline=star-looks-back--name_page.html|title=Star looks back|publisher=''Evening Gazette''|date=[[18 February]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref>

The initial change in her demeanor can be traced back to the death of her mother, [[Lou Beale]]—a fierce dowager, who ruled over her family with a "rod of iron."<ref name="20years5">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Rupert|title=[[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]]|year=2005|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-52269-0|pages=57}}</ref> Following Lou's screen funeral in episode 359 (July 1988), Pauline retorts: "Shut up Arthur Fowler, no one interrupts Pauline Beale when she's in full flow"; a line that was used by her mother in the episode that preceded her death. This recreation of a scene between Lou and Arthur [[symbolism|symbolised]] the transference of the family's [[matriarch]]al role from Lou to Pauline.<ref name="july1">{{cite episode|title=[[EastEnders]]|credits= Written by [[Tony Holland]], directed by [[Julia Smith]]|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=1988-07-28}}</ref><ref name="july2">{{cite episode|title=EastEnders|credits= Written by [[Tony Holland]], directed by [[Julia Smith]]|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=1988-07-26}}</ref>

Wendy Richard has indicated that both she and show creator, Julia Smith, had always intended for Pauline to become like her mother<ref name="anniversary"/><ref name="DSdisappointed"/> and former ''EastEnders'' executive producer, [[John Yorke]], has commented on the importance of the lineage between the two characters: "[Pauline] endures, stoically and heroically, whatever life may throw at her, just as her mother did before her. This sense of lineage is vitally important, too. Pauline has been in the show since its start and was handed the role of matriarch on Lou Beale's death."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,721140,00.html|title=Queen of all soaps|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[24 May]] [[2002]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> 

Pauline became progressively miserable and stern over the course of the show,<ref name="guardianculture"/> which led to her being nicknamed "Fowler the growler" by several other characters in the programme.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20051204/ai_n15905340|title=Ian Hyland: Nickname of the week|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[4 December]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> Pauline addressed this during an on-screen conversation with her best friend, Dot, in an episode that was broadcast on [[24 June]] [[2004]]. She attributed her sombre personality to the deaths of those around her, saying: "If you want to know why I am the way I am, look no further than that."<ref>{{cite episode|title=EastEnders|network=BBC|station=BBC One|airdate=2004-06-24}}</ref>

===Early storylines===
In the first episode it was revealed that Pauline, aged 40, was pregnant with her third child. The character’s pregnancy quickly became a prominent issue within the soap. Pauline was shown to be determined to keep the baby, despite facing severe opposition from her “formidable” mother, Lou ([[Anna Wing]]), who ordered her to “get rid of it”. In addition to “entertaining” the audience, the storyline was used to put across a public message; when it was revealed that Pauline was expecting a “late baby”, scenes showing the character having [[amniocentesis]] tests were aired in order to highlight the increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies.<ref name="biog">{{cite book|last=Wiggins|first= Lizzie|title=Wendy Richard...No "S" : My Life Story|year=2000|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|id=ISBN 978-0743202800|pages=page 118}}</ref> The storyline eventually culminated in the birth of the serial’s first born baby, [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]], in July 1985—a plot that Wendy Richard has classed as her character's happiest, commenting "Although he was a late baby, he was still very much wanted and loved."<ref name="tee"/>

Pauline’s early storylines mainly concentrated upon family and money troubles—coping with her husband Arthur’s redundancy, mental breakdown and imprisonment, son Mark’s delinquency and daughter Michelle’s teenage pregnancy. Pauline was depicted as “the true backbone of the [Fowler] family…the one to try and hold things together, even when she was laid up in hospital with exhaustion or working all hours at the local launderette.”<ref name="gazette">{{cite news|url=http://www.wgazette.com/aut06-beingpauline.html|title=The Importance of Being Pauline|publisher=''Walford Gazette''|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> In October 1985 Wendy Richard commented “There aren't a lot of laughs in life for Pauline. In fact, since the beginning of the serial I don't think that woman has had one carefree moment.”<ref>{{cite news|title=Family matters in Albert Square|url=http://pages.prodigy.net/glc/wrhp/html/wr_rt8510.htm|publisher=''[[Radio Times]]''|date=[[26 October]] [[1985]]|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref>
{{Quote_box |width=48% |align=right|quote="Pauline was suffering from ill health…It was at this stage of the storyline in 1989 that an attempt was made to write [Pauline] out of ''EastEnders'' all together…I was pretty pissed off…Rumours circulated that some of us were to be replaced and I never really felt secure until [executive producer] Michael Ferguson took over."|source=--Wendy Richard<ref name="axing"/>}}
In 1989 the character was used to highlight an "important" gynecological health issue, [[fibroids]].<ref name="first10">{{cite book |last=Brake|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Brake|title=[[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]]|year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2|pages= 74}}</ref> The storyline saw Pauline ignoring health problems (such as chronic fatigue) and using [[Homeopathy|homeopathic remedies]] rather than seeking medical assistance. In the storyline, her fibroids were discovered by chance—the character [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) knocked her down in his [[mini]], and Pauline spent the [[Boxing Day]] 1989 episode in hospital, recovering from a necessary [[hysterectomy]]. However, Wendy Richard has since revealed that the storyline had originally been scripted differently. Before the outcome of Pauline’s illness was screened, producers had decided that the character was to be killed off with cancer—a decision by the show’s boss, [[Mike Gibbon]], to refresh the format by replacing some of the serial’s older characters. The scriptwriters went as far as giving the character a “mystery illness” before the newly appointed executive producer, [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], decided to scrap the original storyline, believing that one of the soap’s original characters was too valuable an asset to lose. The storyline was rewritten and the character was instead given a treatable gynecological ailment.<ref name="axing">Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 149</ref>

===Marriage to Arthur===
Pauline's marriage to the luckless [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] was central to her character and they have been hailed as "the soap's most famous husband and wife team."<ref name="feud">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960512/ai_n14451573|title=WENDY NEVER INVITED ME TO HER WEDDING|publisher=''[[Sunday Mirror]]''|date=[[12 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> The dynamics of Pauline and Arthur's relationship were clear from the beginning of the programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that held the Fowler family together, while Arthur was depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer [[Jacquetta May]], who once played [[Rachel Kominski]] in the programme, has commented that Pauline and Arthur "represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man…Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved like a little boy while Pauline had to make the decisions and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression."<ref name="kominski">{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|title=Square deal|publisher=redpepper.org|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> 
[[Image:Paul arth fryin.jpg|left|thumb|Pauline hits Arthur with a frying pan (1993).]]
Pauline and Arthur were generally seen as the most stable couple in the show, so the storyline involving Arthur's [[adultery|affair]] with [[Christine Hewitt]] ([[Lizzie Power]]) in 1992 came as a shock to viewers.<ref name="first10years">Brake, Colin, p. 128</ref> The storyline was long running, beginning early in 1992 with the introduction of lonely divorcee Christine, who employed Arthur to tend to her garden. A romance was built steadily throughout the year and the buildup contained many twists and turns, starting with Arthur’s rebuff of Christine’s advances, then a confrontation between Pauline and Christine, which convinced Pauline of Arthur’s innocence and left her feeling "strangely sorry for the pathetic, lonely figure, who obviously drank too much."<ref>Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 164</ref> The episode in which Arthur finally gives into temptation and betrays Pauline by sleeping with Christine aired on Christmas Eve 1992.<ref>Brake, Colin, p. 107</ref> It was labeled "The Bonk of the Year" by the British press and was watched by 24.30 million viewers; reported in 2005 as the eleventh most highly viewed UK television programme of all time.<ref>{{cite news|title= The biggest TV audience ever... it is now|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=346942&in_page_id=1773|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=[[1 May]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref>

The storyline continued throughout 1993 as Christine was shown to make greater demands on Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless he did so himself. The situation finally reached a climax on-screen in September 1993.<ref name="first10years"/> The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would find out about the affair; "should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?"<ref name="first10years"/> In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he did, Pauline became violent and hit him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, "an act of betrayal on a massive scale."<ref name="first10years"/> Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this "iconic" scene: "It was one of the few times when you saw Pauline really, really let rip…you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did."<ref name="revealed"/> This episode (written by [[Tony McHale]] and directed by [[Keith Boak]]) was chosen by writer [[Colin Brake]] as the episode of the year in ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The First Ten Years]]''<ref name="first10years"/> and is described by Wendy Richard as "Pauline's crowning moment."<ref name="tee"/> 

For a while it seemed that ''EastEnders''' "most solid" marriage was over,<ref name="first10years"/> but Arthur spent the rest of 1993 trying to convince Pauline that it was worth saving and they eventually reconciled.<ref>Brake, Colin, p. 118</ref> However, more tragedy was to follow when Arthur was framed by a conman, [[Willy Roper]] (dubbed "Wicked Willy" by the British press),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960505/ai_n14451770|title=WICKED WILLY AND HIS FRIEND CARRY ON UP THE NILE|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[5 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> and wrongfully imprisoned for embezzlement in 1995. The storyline captured the public's imagination and a nationwide "Free Arthur Fowler" campaign was launched—"Arthur Fowler Is Innocent" T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the [[UK singles chart]] promoting the campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61275849.html|title=THE NET; My little Willy is on the Web|publisher=''Daily Record''|date=[[23 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>
[[Image:Pauline Arthur EastEnders.jpg|right|thumb|Pauline collects Arthur from prison in 1996, days before his death.]]
Arthur's imprisonment was a precursor to the final exit of actor [[Bill Treacher]], who decided to leave ''EastEnders'' after 11 years playing Arthur.<ref name="Dartagnan">{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,5-2002290611,00.html|title=D'Arthur to D'Artagnan|publisher=''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''|accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref> While Arthur went to pieces in prison, Pauline was heavily embroiled in the storyline pertaining to his eventual release. For several months viewers witnessed Willy attempt to woo Pauline, but she eventually uncovered his deception and then resorted to uncharacteristic [[seduction]] to gain his confession.<ref name="confess">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960512/ai_n14451377|title=Pauline's one jumper ahead|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[12 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> One critic commented "Pauline Fowler deserves a Golden Cardie Award for her performance in ''EastEnders''. The way which she extracted a confession from Willy Roper over the money he stole was nothing short of brilliant."<ref name="confess"/> Arthur was exonerated, but his joyful reunion with Pauline was brief, as an injury he sustained in prison led to a [[brain haemorrhage]] and he died shortly after his release. His death ended an 11 year screen marriage, the serial's most enduring to date.<ref name="feud"/>

===Importance of family===
Pauline remained a family-oriented character throughout the course of the show. A "fiercely loyal, but overbearing mother";<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1817719,00.html|title=Pauline to leave EastEnders|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> sheltering and taking on the major responsibilities of her children and frequently stressing the importance of family.<ref name="kominski"/> She was portrayed as a traditionalist, with strict rules and beliefs—the first to criticise, but also the first to defend her children, often interfering in their issues and causing rifts in their relationships. The inherent affiliation between Pauline and her family has been discussed by one journalist: "As the first episodes aired and the storylines unfolded, Pauline was there to bolster the family unit, and it was clear that she would be an important part of Albert Square, as well as the Fowler home…she shows her inner strength and backbone from our first introduction to her. It is clear that her family is her life, and though her relationships with her children have never been as close and trouble free as she would have liked, it is also clear that she would move heaven and earth for each of them…The Fowler family were a real family, and Pauline was the one to try and hold things together."<ref name="gazette"/>

Early storylines between Pauline and her two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, showed her to be doting mother—forgiving of Mark’s wayward behavior, and supportive when Michelle decided to become a teenage mum. Furthermore, she was shown to be "devoted" to her twin brother [[Pete Beale|Pete]], dutiful to her mother [[Lou Beale|Lou]], allegiant to her husband Arthur, and a "shoulder for her nephew, [[Ian Beale|Ian]], to cry on."<ref name="salt">{{cite news|url=http://pages.prodigy.net/glc/wrhp/html/wr_rt9012.htm|title=Pauline is the Salt of the Earth|publisher=''Radio Times''|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref><ref name="saveEE">{{cite web|url=http://www.saveeastenders.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=266|title=The folded arms, the trademark scowl, will we miss Pauline Fowler?|publisher=saveeastenders.com|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Wendy Richard commented in 1990 “It's important for her to keep the family together. That's why when her problem son Mark suddenly came home [in 1990], it was like her winning the pools…She had to take a lot of shocks from Michelle and I think she coped remarkably well."<ref name="salt"/>

As the serial progressed, Pauline contended with a plethora of family upsets, which included many deaths—her mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996—as well as her elder son [[Mark Fowler|Mark's]] fatal battle with [[HIV]], a storyline that Richard is particularly proud of.<ref name="tee"/> After a year long buildup, Mark was shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on [[Boxing Day]] 1991, attracting 19 million viewers.<ref name="xmas90s">"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19961201/ai_n14455823 Misery, mayhem and murder.. it's Christmas;]", ''Sunday Mirror''. URL last accessed on [[2007-05-29]].</ref> Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline’s reaction to Mark’s news: “To say she was shell-shocked was an understatement and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from Aids at any moment.”<ref>Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 157</ref> The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggled to come to terms with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when "EastEnders" tackled it in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ww2.aegis.org/news/bbc/2005/BB050401.html|title=How well does TV and film tackle disease?|publisher=''BBC News''|date=[[3 April]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> In fact, when the storyline initially aired, more people went for a [[HIV test]] in Britain than at any other time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2006/10/02/hjuniord02.xml&sSheet=/health/2006/10/06/ixhfeatures.html|title=Trust me, I'm a junior doctor: is the truth stronger in fiction?|publisher=''[[The Telegraph]]''|date=[[2 October]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> Wendy Richard commented: "The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and Aids are not exactly the same thing. The Minister of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across."<ref name="tee"/>

The HIV storyline came to an end on-screen in 2003, when the actor [[Todd Carty]] was written out of the serial after 13 years playing Mark. In the serial, Mark discovered that his HIV medication was failing and he decided to leave Walford to spend the remainder of his life traveling—refusing to let Pauline witness his deterioration.<ref name="14 February 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20030214.shtml#4|title=Episode guide—14 February 2003|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go."<ref name="tee"/>

In the latter years of her time in the soap Pauline changed from “a solid, loving, caring mother to a selfish, domineering, unreasonable shrew" who alienated her youngest son.<ref name="gazette"/> Pauline’s relationship with Martin was often shown to be strained by Pauline’s refusal to release control over his life—one reporter has commented: “Martin is the only member of her family who's left and she's done her best to make his life a misery.”<ref name="saveEE"/> Though initially a teenage delinquent, following Mark’s death in 2004, Martin became Pauline’s "dutiful son" who was frequently forced to put his mother’s wishes above those of his wife—a recurring theme within the serial.<ref name="house">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001330006-2004360023,00.html |title=HOUSE THAT FOR AN OFFER!?|publisher=The Sun|date=[[7 August]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Eventually this was shown to cause a rift between the two characters. When Martin went against his mother’s wishes in 2006 and rekindled a romance with his adulterous ex-wife Sonia, she cut him out of her life. Television personality, [[Paul O'Grady]], has addressed Pauline’s refusal to "share her son like a normal mother", commenting: "she’s suspicious of anybody that comes into the family who wants to take her son away from her. She has already lost one son; she has lost her husband, so she’s hanging onto the last one like a mother tiger with her cub."<ref name="revealed"/>

===Friends and enemies===
The character’s narrative also included various feuds, most notably with the soap’s lothario [[Den Watts]], a family-friend who got her daughter Michelle pregnant at the age of 16. ''EastEnders'' pulled in the biggest television audience of the 1980s when 30.15 m watched the 1986 [[Christmas Day]] episode in which Pauline discovered that Den was the father of her granddaughter, [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20050501/ai_n14609480|title=The nation's favourite TV moment?publisher=''The Sunday Herald''|date=[[1 May]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Wendy Richard has commented on the hostility between the characters "once Pauline realised that Dennis was Vicki's father, she was out to get him one way or another" and actor, [[Leslie Grantham]], who played Den added "from then on it was out and out war, which was great!"<ref name="revealed"/> An array of confrontations between Den and Pauline were then featured as she tried to force him to leave Walford, and keep him away from her family. The feud appeared to end in 1989 when the character Den was shot and presumed dead, but it was reignited once again in 2003 when Den was reintroduced, 14 years after he supposedly died. 2005 saw Den killed off for the final time, and although Pauline was not directly responsible for killing him, the item used to bludgeon him to death turned out to be her dog-shaped iron doorstop, which has been described as “a nice touch of pathos”.<ref>{{cite news |title=EastEnders|url=http://aerialtelly.co.uk/eastenders.php|publisher= ''aerialtelly.co.uk''|accessdate=2007-09-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Square-eyed vision - EastEnders|url= http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/7414|publisher= ''[[The Stage]]''|date=[[19 April]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-09-05 }}</ref>
[[Image:Launderette EE.jpg|left|thumb|An early image of Pauline and her oldest friend Dot, working at the launderette in 1988.]]
A large proportion of the character's scenes took place on the set of Walford's [[List of buildings in EastEnders#Launderette|launderette]], where Pauline worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in ''EastEnders''.<ref name="profile"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=39&ArticleID=1924266|title=The ender Pauline|publisher=''Yorshire Evening Post''|date=[[11 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Here, Pauline was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, [[Dot Branning]]. The two characters shared one of the soap's most enduring screen friendships and their scenes together were often used to provide humour.<ref name="tee"/> Particular emphasis was placed on their differences, which led to numerous petty squabbles and once saw them "buried alive" underneath a collapsed fairground ride, in the midst of a cake-selling war (2004).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv_and_radio/story/0,,1246722,00.html|title=Fairground extraction|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[25 June]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> However, Pauline and Dot were most frequently shown [[gossip]]ing, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo has been described by television personality, [[Paul O'Grady]], as a "fabulous double-act" and he went on to say: "Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd never tell anybody else."<ref name="revealed"/>

Pauline was shown to be particularly hostile to the various female characters that featured in her sons' lives, coming to epitomise the [[archetype|archetypal]] “mother-in-law from hell”.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.thisischeshire.co.uk/2005/7/25/255554.html|title=Sharon searches for her dad|publisher=''thisischesire.co.uk''|date=[[25 July]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> One of Pauline’s most notable feuds was with her youngest son Martin’s wife, [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]]. Animosity between the characters began in 2000, when Sonia gave birth to Pauline’s grandchild and decided to give the baby, [[Rebecca Miller (EastEnders)|Chloe]] (later renamed Rebecca), up for adoption. In the storyline, Pauline tried unsuccessfully to fight for custody, leading Sonia to retort “YOU want to bring up Chloe? You couldn't bring up phlegm!”<ref>{{cite episode|title=EastEnders|network=BBC|station=BBC One|airdate=2001-01-11}}</ref> The feuding over Chloe was revisited in storylines throughout 2005 and 2006, when first Pauline was shown to visit her adopted granddaughter against Sonia and Martin’s wishes, and then, following Sonia’s lesbian affair with [[Naomi Julien]], she refused to give Sonia access to the child after Martin regained custody.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001330006-2005192223,00.html|title=Guide to the soaps

In 2004 Pauline was given a dog in the serial, a stray [[Cairn Terrier]] named Betty who became her inseparable sidekick. Wendy Richard has since revealed that it was her decision for Pauline to own a Cairn, commenting "When EastEnders asked if Pauline should have a dog I said it had to be a Cairn Terrier—and Betty joined us!  She's wonderful, she loves me and I love her."<ref>([[13 January]], [[2006]]). "Real Lives:  'Dogs For Disabled Children Are Vital". [[All About Soap]] magazine, p.5, 10, 12, 42-43</ref>

===Second marriage=== 
[[Image:Pauline&Joe.jpg|right|thumb|Pauline and Joe marry, [[17 February]] [[2006]].]]
Several eligible bachelors were shown to express their interest in Pauline over the years, including the characters [[Derek Taylor (EastEnders)|Derek Taylor]] in 1987, [[Danny Taurus]] in 1993, [[Jeff Healy (EastEnders)|Jeff Healy]] (who proposes) in 1999, [[Eddie Skinner]] in 2000, and [[Terry Raymond]], who she went on a blind date with in 2001.<ref name="22 May 2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20010522.shtml#3|title=Episode guide—22 May 2001|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> However, the character remained staunchly faithful to her late husband's memory, refusing to let the relationships progress beyond companionship. In 2001 [[Derek Harkinson]] ([[Ian Lavender]]) was introduced, an old school friend of Pauline's. Initial scripts indicated that Derek was being groomed as a romantic interest for Pauline, which she was shown to welcome. However, the storyline took a twist when he revealed, to her shock, that he was [[homosexuality|gay]].<ref name="18 December 2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20011218.shtml#4|title=Episode guide—18 December 2001|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> 2002 saw Derek move in with the Fowler family, "unconventionally" settling into the show as a replacement father figure for Mark and Martin and as Pauline’s best friend, which led to the two characters being branded a "geriatric [[Will & Grace]]".<ref name="Queeraswalford">{{cite web|url=http://www.wgazette.com/aut03-queer.html|title=Queer As Walford: How Gays Are Portrayed on EastEnders|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> 

In 2005 Pauline was shown to embark on a romance with a new character, [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks]]), who she met at salsa classes. A relationship was developed and despite her initial trepidation the year 2006 saw Pauline remarrying after almost a decade alone. Pauline's marriage to Joe was an attempt to give the character a "new lease of life"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2005570563,00.html|title=Bride 'n gloom|publisher=''The Sun''|date=[[13 December]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> and her wedding day was screened to coincide with ''EastEnders''' 21st anniversary.<ref name="anniversary">{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1710666,00.html|title=In the early days all I ever got were crying scenes|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[16 February]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled—successfully—for Pauline to keep her surname, Fowler.<ref name="anniversary"/> 

In July 2006 however, Wendy Richard announced that she would be leaving the show. She said she made the decision to leave when the producers of ''EastEnders'' revealed that Pauline was to remarry. Richard thought it was "disloyal" of Pauline to her beloved first husband Arthur, commenting: "I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006360264,00.html|title=Wendy: Why I quit Enders|publisher=''The Sun''|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with Ray Brooks, who played Joe, as she did with Bill Treacher, who played Arthur. She refuted producers' opininions that Pauline and Joe "looked good together" and felt that she and Brooks had to work very hard to turn them into a "realistic-looking couple."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/1083/I-quit-EastEnders-because-I-felt-betrayed,-says-Wendy|title=I QUIT EASTENDERS BECAUSE I FELT BETRAYED, SAYS WENDY|publisher=''[[Sunday Express]]''|date=[[7 August]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>

Just two months after the wedding was screened, Pauline's marriage was shown to sour after she discovered Joe's criminal past.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2006600179,00.html|title=Pauline: Whodun'er?|publisher=''The Sun''|date=[[28 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> Their relationship steadily deteriorated throughout the year, and in episodes that aired in December 2006 Pauline ended the marriage—removing her wedding ring and informing Joe that he "was half the man that Arthur had been, that she had never really loved him and that their sex life was a sham." The resulting row saw Joe insult Pauline's family—suggesting that her "perfect marriage" with Arthur was "nothing but a fantasy" and brandishing Mark "diseased", Michelle a "slapper" and Arthur an "con"—to which Pauline responded by smashing a plate over his head.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvscoop.tv/2006/12/pauline_fowler.html|title=Pauline Fowler RIP|publisher=''Tvscoop''accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> Wendy Richard has commented "It was not just the memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man. That is what caused the marriage to be a non starter. Pauline was not mean to Joe, he used her…and lied to her."<ref name="dsinterview"/>

===Deception, reclusiveness and death===
[[Image:Sonia slaps pauline.jpg|left|thumb|Sonia hits Pauline, Christmas Day 2006.]]
Viewers saw the slow build-up to Pauline's climactic exit throughout the latter part of 2006. The character's bitter decline involved depression, pretending to have a [[brain tumour]] to scupper the revived relationship between her son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] and his ex-wife [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]], marital breakdown and finally [[ostracism]] after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discovered her lie.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2006490182,00.html|title=Pauline's Christmas crack-up|publisher=''The Sun''|date=[[24 October]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref> Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline planned to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard has commented on the reasons behind Pauline’s actions: “she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia is more than just a thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times…Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story."<ref name="dsinterview">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a40799/wendy-richard.html|title=Wendy Richard|publisher=''Digital Spy''|date=[[23 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref>

The character was killed off in a "shocking" and dramatic storyline,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/primetime/british_soap_awards|title=What's on TV|publisher=''whatsontv.co.uk''|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref> which aired on Christmas Day 2006 and was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers.

The Christmas Day episodes, written by [[Simon Ashdown]], drew on the show’s early history to mark the occasion of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasized by the use of flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for ''[[The Times]]'', Tim Teeman, commented that "Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl." In addition, her parting scene with the other ''EastEnders'' long-serving "grand dame" [[Dot Branning]] (played by [[June Brown]]) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: "The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot … Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved."<ref name="times"/> 

Richard herself has been less complimentary about her alter ego's departure and has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's "changing character" and "depressing final storyline". In an interview with the [[The Biography Channel|Biography Channel]] she explained: "I did say, promise me you won’t make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did…I wasn’t too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline’s character…Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That’s what [show creator] Julia Smith wanted, and that’s what I felt was right, so I resigned…I think it’s a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now … There was so much history with that family."<ref name="DSdisappointed">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds41025.html|title=Richard disappointed by 'Enders exit|publisher=''[[Digital Spy]]''|date=[[23 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>

As a final tribute to Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special television programme entitled ''[[EastEnders Revealed]]: Goodbye Pauline'', which provided an emotional look back at Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates, [[Todd Carty]] and [[James Alexandrou]] (Mark and Martin respectively) and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and ''EastEnders'' actors such as [[Anna Wing]] and [[Pam St. Clement]] (Lou and [[Pat Evans|Pat]]).<ref name="EErevealed">{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/display.var.1097748.0.eastenders_revealed_goodbye_pauline_bbc1.php|title=EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, BBC One|publisher=''This Is Lancashire''|date=[[2 January]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> During the programme—which aired on [[New Year's Day]], 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how "proud" she was of her character, commenting: "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well.

Pauline is the second-longest running character to feature in ''EastEnders'' and one of only two original characters to remain in the show for almost 22 years.

Lucy Mangan, the culture critic from ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, summed up the character: "Pauline Fowler, is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable … She was presumably intended to be the anchoring force for ''EastEnders'', but because of the writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show."<ref name="guardianculture"/> This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35<sup>th</sup> most annoying person of 2006 in a [[BBC Three]] poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list.<ref name="BBC Three">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0931335/ The Most Annoying People of 2006] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC Three]] | city = London, England | airdate = 2006-12-27}}</ref> In a [[Radio Times]] poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 13% chose Pauline Fowler as the soap character they would most like to see retired.

She's such a large character", and another said "If she goes then I think ''EastEnders'' is finished."<ref name="bbcnewsclip"/> BBC controller of continuing drama, [[John Yorke]], commented "Richard occupies a huge place in people's hearts",<ref name="gone"/> and executive producer [[Kate Harwood]] said, "For many years Wendy simply was ''EastEnders'' for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the ''EastEnders''' spirit…We thank her for everything she has done for the show…"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/11/richard.shtml|title=Wendy Richard MBE to leave EastEnders|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

''[[Inside Soap]]'' editor, Steven Murphy, said that the fact Pauline has been such an "enduring staple" will make it hard for fans to cope with her departure. "It's huge in soap terms…She's a character people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever."<ref name="soaplife"/> When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [EastEnders] has very few of those now."<ref name="bbcnewsclip"/> Jonathan Hughes, editor of ''[[All About Soap]]'' magazine, added "[Pauline's] an absolute legend…You can't imagine the show without her…People will miss her because she's been such an important part of ''EastEnders'' for so many years."<ref name="soaplife"/> However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting "It's the best thing that's ever happened to television getting rid of her. I would have blown her up years ago".<ref name="bbcnewsclip"/>

Pauline's exit in December 2006 was described by ''[[The Times]]'' critic, Tim Teeman, as a "landmark" episode and a"significant sayonara". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as "the most moving in a soap this year" and added that it was a "delight" to "alight" on an episode that was "so satisfying."<ref name="times"/> Conversely, Pauline's exit was described as a "mess" by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! … I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead."<ref name="mess">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20061231/ai_n17087968|title=XMAS EXIT WAS A PAULINE MESS|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[31 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref>

==In popular culture and other media==
''EastEnders'' was the first television show to have a "dial-a-soap" facility. Run by [[British Telecom]] in 1985, the facility allowed people who had missed an episode to ring a number and get an instant update. The synopses were scripted to be no longer than one minute and twenty-eight seconds per episode. Wendy Richard, in character as Pauline, was chosen to be the voice at the other end of the line and narrated each episode.<ref>Smith, Julia; Holland, Tony p. 173</ref>

The character of Pauline was mentioned in the successful BBC drama ''[[This Life]]'' in 1997. In one episode of the show two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watched an episode of ''EastEnders'' on television and mocked Pauline's hysterics and her well documented tendency to wear cardigans.<ref name="thislife">{{cite episode |title=This Life |series= This Life|serieslink=This Life |credits= Including [[Daniela Nardini]], [[Andrew Lincoln]], [[Ramon Tikaram]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]]|began=1997-03-17 |ended=1997-08-07|season= 2}}</ref>

The character has also been spoofed in the successful BBC comedy sketch show, ''[[The Real McCoy (TV series)|The Real McCoy]]'' (1991–1995). One of the show's regular sketches featured a spoof version of ''EastEnders'', with [[black (people)|black]] comedians taking over roles of well known ''EastEnders'' characters who frequented a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian [[Llewella Gideon]] played the role of Pauline and the sketches placed considerable emphasis on her high-pitched voice and tendency to whinge.<ref name="rub">{{cite episode |title=The Real McCoy |series= The Real McCoy|serieslink=The Real McCoy (TV series) |credits= Including [[Llewella Gideon]], [[Meera Syal]], [[Felix Dexter]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]]|airdate=1996-02-02|season= 6|number=5}}</ref>

Pauline has been featured in numerous ''EastEnders'' related merchandise, including calenders, cast-cards, annuals, a knitting pattern book and a greeting card.<ref name="EEbook">{{cite book |last= Lynch|first= Tony|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders Special]] |year=1986|publisher=BBC books|id=ISBN 0-86227-384-6}}</ref> A promotional picture of Pauline and Joe was used on the official ''[[Torchwood]]'' website, in a fictional magazine article about aliens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torchwood.org.uk/html/gadgets/magazine.shtml|title=MAGAZINE ARTICLE, 2007|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref>
