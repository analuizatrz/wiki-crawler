The '''United States of America''' (commonly referred to as the '''United States''', the '''U.S.''', the '''USA''', '''the States''', or '''America''') is a [[federal republic|federal]] [[constitutional republic]] comprising [[U.S. state|fifty states]] and a [[federal district]]. The country is situated mostly in central [[North America]], where its [[Contiguous United States|forty-eight contiguous states]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]], lie between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s, bordered by [[Canada]] to the north and [[Mexico]] to the south. The state of [[Alaska]] is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and [[Russia]] to the west across the [[Bering Strait]]. The state of [[Hawaii]] is an [[archipelago]] in the mid-Pacific. The country also possesses [[Territories of the United States|several territories]], or [[insular area]]s, scattered around the [[Caribbean]] and Pacific.

At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km²) and with about 305 million people, the United States is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|third or fourth]] largest country by total area, and third largest by land area and [[List of countries by population|by population]].

==Etymology==
In 1507, [[Martin Waldseemüller]] produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere [[Americas|"America"]] after the first name of Italian explorer and [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[Amerigo Vespucci]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-24-america-turns-500_N.htm?csp=34|title=Cartographer Put 'America' on the Map 500 years Ago|work=USA Today|date=2007-04-24|accessdate=2008-11-30}} </ref> The former British colonies first used the country's modern name in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which was the "unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America" adopted by the "Representatives of the united States of America" on July 4, 1776.<!--Do not uppercase "united" here: it is unambiguously lowercased in the Declaration--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters.html|title=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> The current name was finalized on November 15, 1777, when the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first of which states, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'" The short form ''United States'' is also standard. Other common forms include the ''U.S.'', the ''USA'', and ''America''. Colloquial names include the ''U.S. of A.'' and ''the States''. ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'', a once popular name for the United States, was derived from [[Christopher Columbus]]. It appears in the name "[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]". 
The standard way to refer to a citizen of the United States is as an ''[[American (word)|American]].'' Though ''United States'' is the formal adjective, ''American'' and ''U.S.'' are the most common adjectives used to refer to the country ("American values," "U.S. forces"). ''American'' is rarely used in English to refer to people not connected to the United States.<ref>Wilson, Kenneth G. (1993). ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English''. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 27–28. ISBN 0231069898.</ref>

The phrase "the United States" was originally treated as plural—e.g., "the United States are"—including in the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1865. It became common to treat it as singular—e.g., "the United States is"—after the end of the Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html|author=Zimmer, Benjamin|date=2005-11-24|title=Life in These, Uh, This United States|publisher=University of Pennsylvania—Language Log|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>

[[Image:USATopographicalMap.jpg|left|thumb|[[Topography|Topographic map]] of the [[contiguous United States]]]]

The United States is situated almost entirely in the [[Western Hemisphere]]: the [[contiguous United States]] stretches from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east, with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the southeast; it is bordered by Canada on the [[Canada – United States border|north]] and Mexico on the [[Mexico–United States border|south]]. Alaska is the largest state in area; separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, it touches the Pacific on the south and the Arctic Ocean on the north. Hawaii occupies an [[archipelago]] in the central Pacific, southwest of North America. After Russia and Canada, the United States is the world's third or fourth [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|largest nation by total area]], ranking just above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is calculated: the CIA ''World Factbook'' gives {{convert|3794083|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="WF"/> the United Nations Statistics Division gives {{convert|3717813|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/DYB2005/Table03.pdf|title=Population by Sex, Rate of Population Increase, Surface Area and Density|publisher=UN Statistics Division|work=Demographic Yearbook 2005|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> and the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives {{convert|3676486|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:2lOa44xXcrgJ:www.britannica.com/eb/article-9111233/United-States+United+States+Area+encyclopedia+britannica&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us|title=United States|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> Including only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/factbook/countrycompare/area/3d.html;_ylt=As1XMsN8kgSx746VWazy_s7PecYF| title = World Factbook: Area Country Comparison Table| publisher = Yahoo Education| accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> The United States also possesses several [[Territories of the United States|insular territories]] scattered around the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] (e.g., the [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]]) and the Pacific (e.g., [[Guam]]).

The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to [[deciduous]] forests and the rolling hills of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]. The [[Appalachian Mountains]] divide the eastern seaboard from the [[Great Lakes]] and the grasslands of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]–[[Missouri River]], the world's [[List of rivers by length|fourth longest river system]], runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile [[prairie]] of the [[Great Plains]] stretches to the west, interrupted by [[U.S. Interior Highlands|a highland region]] in the southeast. The [[Rocky Mountains]], at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000&nbsp;feet (4,300&nbsp;m) in [[Colorado]]. Farther west are the rocky [[Great Basin]] and deserts such as the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]]. The [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] mountain ranges run close to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]]. At 20,320&nbsp;feet (6,194&nbsp;m), Alaska's [[Mount McKinley]] is the country's tallest peak. Active [[volcano]]es are common throughout Alaska's [[Alexander Archipelago|Alexander]] and [[Aleutian Islands]], and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The [[supervolcano]] underlying [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/supervolcano/under/under.html|title=Supervolcano: What's Under Yellowstone?| author=O'Hanlon, Larry|publisher=Discovery Channel|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>

To the east of the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]], the climate ranges from [[humid continental]] in the north to [[humid subtropical]] in the south. The southern tip of [[Florida]] is tropical, as is Hawaii. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains are [[Alpine climate|alpine]]. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in [[coastal California]], and [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] in coastal [[Oregon]] and [[Washington]] and southern Alaska.

In 1492, [[Genoa|Genoese]] explorer [[Christopher Columbus]], under contract to the Spanish crown, reached several Caribbean islands, making [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] with the indigenous people.  On April 2, 1513, Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]] landed on what he called "[[History of Florida|La Florida]]"—the first documented European arrival on what would become the U.S. mainland. Of Spain's settlements in the region, only [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], founded in 1565, remains. Later Spanish settlements in the present-day [[southwestern United States]] drew thousands through Mexico. French [[fur trade]]rs established outposts of [[New France]] around the [[Great Lakes]]; France eventually claimed much of the North American interior, down to the Gulf of Mexico. The first successful English settlements were the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 and the [[Pilgrim]]s' [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620. The 1628 chartering of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] resulted in a wave of migration; by 1634, [[New England]] had been settled by some 10,000 [[Puritan]]s. Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, about 50,000 convicts were shipped to Britain's American colonies.<ref>{{cite web|work=Butler, James Davie|url=http://www.dinsdoc.com/butler-1.htm|title=British Convicts Shipped to American Colonies | publisher = Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History|work=American Historical Review 2|date=October 1896| accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Beginning in 1614, the Dutch settled along the lower [[Hudson River]], including [[New Amsterdam]] on [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]].

In 1674, the Dutch ceded their American territory to England; the province of [[New Netherland]] was renamed New York. Many new immigrants, especially to [[History of the Southern United States|the South]], were [[indentured servants]]—some two-thirds of all Virginia immigrants between 1630 and 1680.<ref>Russell, David Lee (2005).

With the 1729 division of [[the Carolinas]] and the 1732 colonization of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the thirteen British colonies that would become the United States of America were established. All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient [[rights of Englishmen]] and a sense of self-government stimulating support for [[republicanism]]. All legalized the [[African slave trade]]. With high birth rates, low death rates, and steady immigration, the colonial population grew rapidly. The Christian [[Revivalism|revivalist]] movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty. In the [[French and Indian War]], British forces seized Canada from the French, but the [[francophone]] population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (popularly known as "American Indians"), who were being displaced, those thirteen colonies had a population of 2.6 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain; nearly one in five Americans were black slaves.<ref>Blackburn, Robin (1998).

Proclaiming that "[[all men are created equal]]" and endowed with "certain [[inalienable rights|unalienable Rights]]," the Congress adopted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]], on July 4, 1776. That date is now celebrated annually as America's [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]. In 1777, the [[Articles of Confederation]] established a weak federal government that operated until 1789.

After the [[Siege of Yorktown|British defeat]] by American forces who were [[France in the American Revolutionary War|assisted by the French]], Great Britain [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|recognized the independence of the United States]] and the states' [[sovereignty]] over American territory west to the [[Mississippi River]]. A [[Philadelphia Convention|constitutional convention]] was organized in 1787 by those wishing to establish a strong national government, with powers of taxation. The [[United States Constitution]] was ratified in 1788, and the new republic's [[1st United States Congress|first Senate, House of Representatives]], and [[President of the United States|president]]—George Washington—took office in 1789. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.

Attitudes toward [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] were shifting; a [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|clause in the Constitution]] protected the African slave trade only until 1808. The Northern states abolished slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the [[slave state]]s of the South as defenders of the "[[peculiar institution]]." The [[Second Great Awakening]], beginning about 1800, made [[evangelicalism]] a force behind various social [[reform movement]]s, including [[abolitionism]].

[[Image:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|right|thumb|Territorial acquisitions by date]]
Americans' eagerness to [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|expand westward]] prompted a long series of [[Indian Wars]] and an [[Indian removal]] policy that stripped the native peoples of their land. The [[Louisiana Purchase]] of French-claimed territory under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size. The [[War of 1812]], declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. [[nationalism]]. A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led [[Spanish Cession|Spain to cede]] it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The United States annexed the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1845. The concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] was popularized during this time.<ref>Morrison, Michael A. (1999). ''Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 13–21. ISBN 0807847968.</ref> The 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]]. The U.S. victory in the [[Mexican-American War]] resulted in the 1848 [[Mexican Cession|cession]] of [[California]] and much of the present-day [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. The [[California Gold Rush]] of 1848–49 further spurred western migration. [[Rail transport in the United States#History|New railways]] made relocation easier for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million [[American bison]], or buffalo, were slaughtered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the buffalo, a primary resource for the [[plains Indians]], was an existential blow to many native cultures.

===Civil War and industrialization===

[[Image:Battle of Gettysburg, by Currier and Ives.png|thumb|left|''[[Battle of Gettysburg]]'', lithograph by [[Currier and Ives|Currier & Ives]], ca. 1863]]
[[Origins of the American Civil War|Tensions]] between slave and [[Free state (United States)|free states]] mounted with arguments over the relationship between the [[states' rights|state and federal governments]], as well as [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflicts]] over the spread of slavery into new states. [[Abraham Lincoln]], candidate of the largely antislavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was elected president in 1860. Before he took office, seven slave states declared their [[secession]]—which the federal government maintained was illegal—and formed the [[Confederate States of America]]. With the Confederate [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack upon Fort Sumter]], the [[American Civil War]] began and four more slave states joined the Confederacy. Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] committed the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] to ending slavery. Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S. Constitution [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|ensured freedom]] for the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860a-02.pdf | title = 1860 Census | publisher = U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate = 2007-06-10}} Page 7 lists a total slave population of 3,953,760.</ref> [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|made them citizens]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|gave them voting rights]].

[[Image:Ellis island 1902.jpg|thumb|Immigrants landing at [[Ellis Island]], New York, 1902]]
After the war, the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination of Lincoln]] [[Radical Republican (USA)|radicalized Republican]] [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] policies aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves. The resolution of the disputed [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 presidential election]] by the [[Compromise of 1877]] ended Reconstruction; [[Jim Crow laws]] soon [[Disfranchisement after the Civil War|disenfranchised many African Americans]]. In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented [[Immigration to the United States#Immigration 1850 to 1930|influx of immigrants]] from [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] hastened the [[United States technological and industrial history#Technological systems and infrastructure|country's industrialization]]. The wave of immigration, lasting until 1929, provided labor and transformed American culture. High tariff protections, national infrastructure building, and new banking regulations encouraged growth. The 1867 [[Alaska purchase]] from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The [[Wounded Knee massacre]] in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the [[Indian Wars]]. In 1893, the [[Ancient Hawaii|indigenous monarchy]] of the Pacific [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was overthrown in a coup led by American residents; the United States annexed the archipelago in 1898. Victory in the [[Spanish-American War]] the same year demonstrated that the United States was a [[Great power|world power]] and led to the annexation of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [[Philippines]]. The Philippines gained independence a half-century later; Puerto Rico and Guam remain U.S. territories.

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the United States remained neutral. Most Americans sympathized with the British and French, although many opposed intervention.<ref>Foner, Eric, and John A. Garraty (1991). ''The Reader's Companion to American History.''

After his election as president in 1932, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] responded with the [[New Deal]], a range of policies increasing government intervention in the economy. The [[Dust Bowl]] of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.

The United States, effectively neutral during [[World War II]]'s early stages after [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, began supplying [[materiel]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in March 1941 through the [[Lend-Lease]] program.

===Cold War and protest politics===
{{main|Cold War|African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Vietnam War}}
[[Image:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] delivering his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, 1963]]

The United States and Soviet Union jockeyed for power after World War II during the [[Cold War]], dominating the military affairs of Europe through [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States promoted [[liberal democracy]] and capitalism, while the Soviet Union promoted communism and a centrally [[planned economy]]. Both supported dictatorships and engaged in [[proxy war]]s. American troops fought [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese]] forces in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–53. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] pursued a series of investigations into suspected leftist subversion, while Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] became the figurehead of anticommunist sentiment.

The 1961 Soviet launch of the [[Vostok 1|first manned spaceflight]] prompted President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call for the United States to be first to land [[Apollo program|"a man on the moon,"]] achieved in 1969. Kennedy also faced a [[Cuban Missile Crisis|tense nuclear showdown]] with Soviet forces in Cuba. Meanwhile, the United States experienced sustained economic expansion. A growing [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]], led by African Americans such as [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], fought segregation and discrimination. Following [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy's assassination]] in 1963, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] were passed under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Johnson and his successor, [[Richard Nixon]], expanded a proxy war in Southeast Asia into the unsuccessful [[Vietnam War]]. A widespread [[Counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural movement]] grew, fueled by [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the war]], [[black nationalism]], and the [[sexual revolution]]. [[Betty Friedan]], [[Gloria Steinem]], and others led a [[Second-wave feminism|new wave of feminism]] that sought political, social, and economic equality for women.

As a result of the [[Watergate scandal]], in 1974 Nixon became the first U.S. president to resign, rather than be [[impeachment|impeached]] on charges including obstruction of justice and abuse of power; he was [[United States presidential line of succession|succeeded]] by Vice President [[Gerald Ford]]. The [[Jimmy Carter]] administration of the late 1970s was marked by [[stagflation]] and the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. The election of [[Ronald Reagan]] as president in 1980 heralded a significant [[Conservatism in the United States|rightward shift in American politics]], reflected in major changes in [[Reaganomics|taxation and spending priorities]]. His second term in office brought both the [[Iran-Contra affair|Iran-Contra scandal]] and significant [[Cold War (1985–1991)|diplomatic progress with the Soviet Union]]. The subsequent Soviet collapse ended the Cold War.

The leadership role taken by the United States and its allies in the UN–sanctioned [[Gulf War]], under President [[George H. W. Bush]], and the [[Yugoslav wars]], under President [[Bill Clinton]], helped to preserve its position as a superpower. The longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history—from March 1991 to March 2001—encompassed the Clinton administration and the [[dot-com bubble]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Voyce, Bill |url=http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/ArticleReader?itemid=00003700&print=1|title=Why the Expansion of the 1990s Lasted So Long|publisher=Iowa Workforce Information Network|date=2006-08-21|accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref> A [[Paula Jones|civil lawsuit]] and [[Lewinsky scandal|sexual scandal]] led to [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton's impeachment]] in 1998, but he remained in office.

[[September 11 attacks|On September 11, 2001]], [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists struck the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City and [[The Pentagon]] near Washington, D.C., killing nearly three thousand people.

==Government and elections==
{{main|Federal government of the United States|Elections in the United States}}
[[Image:Capitol Building Full View.jpg|thumb|right|The west front of the [[United States Capitol]], which houses the [[United States Congress]]]]
The United States is the world's oldest surviving [[federation]]. It is a [[constitutional republic]], "in which [[majority rule]] is tempered by [[minority rights]] protected by [[Law of the United States|law]]."<ref>Scheb, John M., and John M. Scheb II (2002). ''An Introduction to the American Legal System''. Florence, KY: Delmar, p. 6. ISBN 0766827593.</ref> It is fundamentally structured as a [[representative democracy]], though U.S. citizens residing in the territories are excluded from voting for federal officials.<ref>Raskin, James B. (2003). ''Overruling Democracy: The Supreme Court Vs. the American People''. London and New York: Routledge, pp. 36–38. ISBN 0415934397.</ref> The government is regulated by a system of [[separation of powers|checks and balances]] defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document and as a [[social contract]] for the American people. In the [[Federalism#United States|American federalist system]], citizens are usually subject to [[Political divisions of the United States|three levels of government]], federal, state, and local; the [[Local government in the United States|local government]]'s duties are commonly split between [[County (United States)|county]] and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]] of citizens by district. There is no [[proportional representation]] at the federal level, and it is very rare at lower levels. Federal and state judicial and [[cabinet]] officials are typically nominated by the executive branch and approved by the legislature, although some state judges and officials are elected by popular vote.

[[Image:WhiteHouseSouthFacade.JPG|thumb|left|The South Portico of the [[White House]], home and work place of the U.S. president]]

The federal government is composed of three branches:
* [[legislature|Legislative]]: The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[United States Congress|Congress]], made up of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], makes [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]], and has the power of [[impeachment]], by which it can remove sitting members of the government.
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of the United States|president]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, can veto [[Bill (proposed law)|legislative bills]] before they become law, and appoints the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary|Judicial]]: The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and lower [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, appoints, interpret laws, and can overturn laws they deem [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

The House of Representatives has 435 members, each representing a [[congressional district]] for a two-year term. House seats are [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] among the states by population every tenth year. As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], seven states have the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, has fifty-three. The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected [[at-large]] to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office [[Term limits in the United States|no more than twice]]. The president is [[United States presidential election|not elected by direct vote]], but by an indirect [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] system in which the determining votes are apportioned by state. The Supreme Court, led by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], has nine members, who serve for life. The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; [[Nebraska]] uniquely has a [[unicameral]] legislature. The [[Governor#United States|governor]] (chief executive) of each state is directly elected.

[[Image:USSupremeCourtWestFacade.JPG|thumb|right|The front of the [[United States Supreme Court building]]]]

All laws and procedures of both state and federal governments are subject to review, and any law ruled in violation of the Constitution by the judiciary is voided. The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] protects the right to the "great writ" of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]], and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]] guarantees the [[Jury trial#The United States|right to a jury trial]] in all criminal cases. [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Amendments to the Constitution]] require the approval of three-fourths of the states. The Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times; the first ten amendments, which make up the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] form the central basis of Americans' individual rights.

===Parties, ideology, and politics===

[[Image:President George W. Bush and Barack Obama meet in Oval Office.jpg|thumb|President-elect [[Barack Obama]] (right) meets with current President [[George W. Bush]] (left) in the [[Oval Office]], November 10, 2008]]
The United States has operated under a [[two-party system]] for most of its history. For elective offices at all levels, state-administered [[primary election]]s choose the major party nominees for subsequent [[general election]]s. Since the [[United States presidential election, 1856|general election of 1856]], the major parties have been the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], [[History of the United States Democratic Party|founded in 1824]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], [[History of the United States Republican Party|founded in 1854]]. Since the Civil War, only one [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] presidential candidate—former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]], running as a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive]] in [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]]—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote.

Within American [[political culture]], the Republican Party is considered "center-right" or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and the Democratic Party is considered "center-left" or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. The states of the [[Northeastern United States#Politics|Northeast]] and [[Western United States#Politics|West Coast]] and some of the [[Great Lakes]] states, known as "[[Red states and blue states|blue states]]", are relatively liberal. The "[[red states]]" of the [[Politics of the Southern United States|South]] and much of the [[Midwestern United States#Political trends|Great Plains]] and [[Western United States#Politics|Rocky Mountains]] are relatively conservative. A plurality of Americans identify as Democrats, yet significantly more Americans identify as conservative than liberal.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Associated Press–Yahoo Poll|date=2008-09-20|publisher=AP|url=http://surveys.ap.org/data/KnowledgeNetworks/AP_Election_Wave6_Topline_W6%20ALL%20weight5_091808.pdf|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> Among the rights explicitly addressed in the Constitution, [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|gun ownership]] is the subject of [[Gun politics in the United States|particularly contentious debate]].

The incumbent president, Republican [[George W. Bush]], is the [[List of Presidents of the United States|43rd U.S. president]]. All presidents to date have been men of European descent. After winning the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], Democrat [[Barack Obama]] will be the first president of mixed European and African descent. The [[United States general elections, 2008|2008 elections]] also saw the Democratic Party strengthen its control of both the House and the Senate. Every member of the U.S. Congress is a Democrat or a Republican except two [[Independent (politician)|independent]] members of the Senate. An [[Political party strength in U.S. states|overwhelming majority]] of state and local officials are also Democrats or Republicans.

==Geographic divisions==
{{main|U.S. state|Territorial evolution of the United States|Territorial acquisitions of the United States}}
The United States is a [[federation|federal union]] of fifty states. The original thirteen states were the successors of the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] that rebelled against British rule. Most of the rest have been carved from territory obtained through war or purchase by the U.S. government. The exceptions are [[Vermont]], [[Texas]], and Hawaii; each was an independent republic before joining the union. Early in the country's history, three states were created out of the territory of existing ones: [[Kentucky]] from [[Virginia]]; [[Tennessee]] from [[North Carolina]]; and [[Maine]] from [[Massachusetts]]. [[West Virginia]] broke away from Virginia during the [[American Civil War]]. The most recent state—Hawaii—achieved statehood on August 21, 1959. The states [[Texas v. White|do not have the right]] to [[secession|secede]] from the union.

The states compose the vast bulk of the U.S. land mass; the two other areas considered integral parts of the country are the District of Columbia, the [[federal district]] where the capital, Washington, is located; and [[Palmyra Atoll]], an uninhabited but [[territories of the United States|incorporated territory]] in the Pacific Ocean. The United States also possesses five major overseas territories: [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]] in the Caribbean; and [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] in the Pacific. Those born in the territories (except for American Samoa) possess [[Birthright citizenship in the United States of America|U.S. citizenship]].

The United States exercises global economic, political, and military influence. It is a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and New York City hosts the [[United Nations Headquarters]]. Almost all countries have [[List of diplomatic missions in the United States|embassies]] in Washington, D.C., and many host [[Consul (representative)|consulates]] around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host [[Diplomatic missions of the United States|American diplomatic missions]]. However, [[Cuba-United States relations|Cuba]], [[United States-Iran relations|Iran]], [[North Korea-United States relations|North Korea]], [[Bhutan]], [[Sudan]], and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States.

The United States enjoys a [[Special Relationship (US-UK)|special relationship]] with the [[Anglo-American relations|United Kingdom]] and strong ties with [[United States-Australia relations|Australia]], [[New Zealand-United States relations|New Zealand]], [[Japan-United States relations|Japan]], [[Israel-United States relations|Israel]], and fellow NATO members. It also works closely with its neighbors through the [[Organization of American States]] and [[United States free trade agreements|free trade agreements]] such as the trilateral [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with [[Canada – United States relations|Canada]] and [[United States-Mexico relations|Mexico]]. In 2005, the United States spent $27 billion on [[official development assistance]], the most in the world. However, as a share of [[Gross National Income|gross national income]] (GNI), the U.S. contribution of 0.22% ranked twentieth of twenty-two donor states. Nongovernmental sources such as private foundations, corporations, and educational and religious institutions donated $96 billion.

[[Image:Kerouac by Palumbo.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Jack Kerouac]], one of the best known figures of the [[Beat Generation]]]]
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]] established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. [[Mark Twain]] and poet [[Walt Whitman]] were major figures in the century's second half; [[Emily Dickinson]], virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet. A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), Twain's ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1885), and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925)—may be dubbed the "[[Great American Novel]]."

Eleven U.S. citizens have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], most recently [[Toni Morrison]] in 1993. [[Ernest Hemingway]], the 1954 Nobel laureate, is often named as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century.<ref>Meyers, Jeffrey (1999). ''Hemingway: A Biography''. New York: Da Capo, p. 139. ISBN 0306808900.</ref> Popular literary genres such as the [[Western fiction|Western]] and [[Hardboiled|hardboiled crime fiction]] developed in the United States. The [[Beat Generation]] writers opened up new literary approaches, as have [[postmodern literature|postmodernist]] authors such as [[John Barth]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], and [[Don DeLillo]].

The [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]], led by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and Thoreau, established the first major American [[philosophical movement]]. After the Civil War, [[Charles Peirce]] and then [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] were leaders in the development of [[pragmatism]]. In the 20th century, the work of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and [[Richard Rorty]] helped popularize [[analytic philosophy]] among U.S. academics.

In the visual arts, the [[Hudson River School]] was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]]. The 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York City, an exhibition of European [[Modern art|modernist art]], shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.<ref>Brown, Milton W. (1988 1963). ''The Story of the Armory Show''. New York: Abbeville. ISBN 0896597954.</ref> [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Marsden Hartley]], and others experimented with new styles, displaying a highly individualistic sensibility. Major artistic movements such as the [[abstract expressionism]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] and the [[pop art]] of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then [[postmodernism]] has brought fame to American architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Frank Gehry]].

One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario [[P. T. Barnum]], who began operating a lower [[Manhattan]] entertainment complex in 1841. The team of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]] produced a series of popular [[musical theatre|musical]] comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; the songs of musical theater composers such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]] have become [[Traditional pop music|pop standards]]. Playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] winners [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Edward Albee]], and [[August Wilson]].

Though largely overlooked at the time, [[Charles Ives]]'s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition; other experimentalists such as [[Henry Cowell]] and [[John Cage]] created an American approach to classical composition. [[Aaron Copland]] and [[George Gershwin]] developed a unique synthesis of popular and classical music. [[Choreography|Choreographers]] [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Martha Graham]] helped create [[modern dance]], while [[George Balanchine]] and [[Jerome Robbins]] were leaders in 20th century ballet. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of [[photography]], with major photographers including [[Alfred Stieglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]] and [[Ansel Adams]]. The newspaper [[comic strip]] and the [[American comic book|comic book]] are both U.S. innovations. [[Superman]], the quintessential comic book [[superhero]], has become an American icon.

Mainstream American [[culinary art]]s are similar to those in other Western countries. [[Wheat]] is the primary [[cereal]] grain. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[white-tailed deer]] [[venison]], [[potato]]es, [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize|corn]], [[squash (plant)|squash]], and [[maple syrup]], indigenous foods employed by Native Americans and early European settlers. Slow-cooked pork and beef [[barbecue]], [[crab cake]]s, [[potato chip]]s, and [[chocolate chip cookie]]s are distinctively American styles. [[Soul food]], developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere. [[Syncretism|Syncretic]] cuisines such as [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana creole]], [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]], and [[Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex]] are regionally important. Characteristic dishes such as [[apple pie]], [[fried chicken]], [[pizza]], [[hamburger]]s, and [[hot dog]]s derive from the recipes of various immigrants. [[French fried potatoes|French fries]], Mexican dishes such as [[burrito]]s and [[taco]]s, and [[pasta]] dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.<ref name="IFT">{{cite web |url=http://www.ift.org/cms/?pid=1000496 |author=Klapthor, James N. |title=What, When, and Where Americans Eat in 2003 |publisher=Institute of Food Technologists |date=2003-08-23|accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Americans generally prefer coffee to tea.

[[Image:Ldt tackle.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pro Bowl]] (2006), [[American football]]'s annual [[all-star game]]]]
Since the late 19th century, [[baseball]] has been regarded as the [[national sport]]; [[American football]], [[basketball]], and [[ice hockey]] are the country's three other leading professional team sports. [[College football]] and [[College basketball|basketball]] attract large audiences. Football is now by several measures the most popular [[spectator sport]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Krane, David K. |title=Professional Football Widens Its Lead Over Baseball as Nation's Favorite Sport |url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=337 |publisher=Harris Interactive |date=2002-10-30|accessdate=2007-09-14}} Maccambridge, Michael (2004).

ISBN 0375504540.</ref> [[Boxing]] and [[horse racing]] were once the most watched individual sports, but they have been eclipsed by [[golf]] and [[auto racing]], particularly [[NASCAR]]. [[Association football|Soccer]] is played widely at the youth and amateur levels and is growing in popularity as a professional spectator sport. [[Tennis]] and many outdoor sports are popular as well.

While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, [[volleyball]], [[skateboarding]], and [[snowboarding]] are American inventions. [[Lacrosse]] and [[surfing]] arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact. Eight [[Olympic Games]] have [[United States at the Olympics|taken place in the United States.]] The United States has won 2,301 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]], more than any other country,<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Medal Standings, 1896–2004 | publisher = Information Please|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0115108.html | accessdate=2007-06-14}} {{cite web|title=Distribution of Medals—2008 Summer Games| publisher = Fact Monster|url=http://www.factmonster.com/sports/olympics/2008/distribution-medals-summer-games.html| accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> and 216 in the [[Winter Olympic Games]], the second most.<ref>{{cite web |title=All-Time Medal Standings, 1924–2006 |publisher=Information Please |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0115207.html |accessdate=2007-06-14}} Norway is first; the Soviet Union is third, and would be second if its medal count was combined with Russia's.</ref>
