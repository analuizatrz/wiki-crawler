[[Image:Waterhouse a mermaid.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A Mermaid'' by [[John William Waterhouse]].]]A '''mermaid''' (from the [[Middle English]] ''mere'' in the obsolete sense 'sea' (as in ''[[maritime]]'', the Latin [[mare]], "sea") + ''maid(en)'') is a [[legendary creature|legendary]] [[aquatic]] creature with the head and torso of human female and the tail of a fish. The male version of a mermaid is called a [[merman]]; gender-neutral plurals could be ''merpeople'' or ''merfolk''. Various cultures throughout the world have similar figures.
'''

Much like [[sirens]], mermaids in stories would sometimes sing to sailors and enchant them, distracting them from their work and causing them to walk off the deck or cause shipwrecks. Other stories would have them squeeze the life out of drowning men while trying to rescue them. They are also said to take them down to their underwater kingdoms. In [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' it is said that they forget that humans cannot breathe underwater, while others say they drown men out of spite. 

The [[Siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]] are sometimes portrayed in later [[folklore]] as mermaid-like; in fact, some languages use the same word for both creatures. Other related types of [[mythology|mythical]] or [[legend]]ary creature are [[water fairies]] (e.g. various [[Nymph|water nymphs]]) and [[selkie]]s, animals that can transform themselves from seals to humans.

Prior to the mid 19th century, mariners referred to [[Manatee]] and [[Dugongs]] as mermaids.

==Legend and myth==
[[Image:John Collier - The Land Baby.jpg|300px|thumb|left|''The Land Baby'', by [[John Collier (artist)| John Collier]] (1899)]]
Legends of these half-human, half-fish humanoids have circulated for millennia, even as far back as 5000 BC.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}
It has been widely suggested or implied that [[manatee]]s or [[dugong]]s could be behind the myth of the mermaid. An example supporting this theory would be that [[Christopher Columbus]] had logged that he had seen mermaids on his journey to the new world, but thought they would be more attractive. These large aquatic [[mammal]]s are notable for the way in which they carry their young, cradled in their arms much as a human would carry a baby. It is possible that sailors seeing these unfamiliar beasts for the first time, would assume that they had in fact stumbled across some sort of [[humanoid]] species, and consequently spread their accounts of the sightings through their homelands on their return from voyages. It has even been posited that the traditional image of a mermaid with long flowing hair could be attributed to manatees breaking the ocean surface underneath patches of [[seaweed]], and giving the unfamiliar observer the impression of having long hair. Sightings from first-hand witnesses generally describe mermaids who do not talk and have green or black hair.<ref>http://www.newanimal.org/merfolk.htm</ref>

===Ancient Near East===

Tales of mermaids are nearly universal.  The first known mermaid [[folklore|stories]] appeared in [[Assyria]], ca. [[1000s BC|1000 BC]]. [[Atargatis]], the mother of Assyrian queen [[Semiramis]], was a goddess who loved a mortal shepherd and in the process killed him. Ashamed, she jumped into a lake to take the form of a fish, but the waters would not conceal her divine beauty. Thereafter, she took the form of a mermaid &mdash; human above the waist, fish below &mdash; though the earliest representations of Atargatis showed her as being a fish with a human head and legs, similar to the [[Babylonia]]n [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]]. The Greeks recognized Atargatis under the name Derketo, where she was often [[wiktionary:conflate|conflated]] with [[Aphrodite]].

Prior to 546 BC, the [[Milesian]] philosopher [[Anaximander]] proposed that mankind had sprung from an aquatic species of animal. He thought that humans, with their extended [[infancy]], could not have survived early on. This idea does not appear to have survived Anaximander's death.

A popular Greek legend has [[Alexander the Great]]'s sister, [[Thessalonice of Macedon|Thessalonike]], turn into a mermaid after her death.<ref> {{PDFlink|[http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/mpt/alexander/guide/teachers_guide.pdf Teacher's Guide]|246&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 252547 bytes -->}}</ref> She lived, it was said, in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and when sailors would encounter her, she would ask them only one question: ''"Is Alexander the king alive?"'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Ζει ο βασιλιάς Αλέξανδρος;''), to which the correct answer would be ''"He lives and still rules"'' (Greek: ''Ζει και βασιλεύει''). Any other answer would spur her into a rage, where she transformed into a [[Gorgon]] and meant doom for the ship and every sailor onboard.

[[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] in [[Syria]] (2nd century AD) in ''De Dea Syria'' ("Concerning the Syrian Goddess") wrote of the Syrian temples he had visited:
:"Among them - Now that is the traditional story among them concerning the temple. But other men swear that Semiramis of [[Babylonia]], whose deeds are many in Asia, also founded this site, and not for Hera [[Atargatis]] but for her own Mother, whose name was [[Atargatis|Derketo]]"
:"I saw the likeness of Derketo in [[Phoenicia]], a strange marvel. It is woman for half its length, but the other half, from thighs to feet, stretched out in a fish's tail. But the image in [[Jerusalem|the Holy City]] is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fishes to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other fowls, they do not eat the dove, for she is holy so they believe. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and [[Semiramis]], the first because Derketo has the shape of a fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a [[dove]]. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the [[Egyptians]], some people do not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo."<ref>Lucian of Samosata, ''De Dea Syria'' Part 2, Chapter 14</ref>

===Arabian Nights===

The [[Arabian Nights]] include several tales featuring "Sea People", such as ''Djullanar the Sea-girl''. Unlike the depiction in other mythologies, these are anatomically identical to land-bound humans, differing only in their ability to breathe and live underwater. They can (and do) interbreed with land humans, the children of such unions inheriting the ability to live underwater.

Mermaids were noted in British folklore as both ominous, foretelling disaster, and provoking it.<ref name="briggs">Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermaids", p 287. ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>  Several variants of the [[ballad]] ''[[Sir Patrick Spens]]'' depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships; in some, she tells them they will never see land again, and in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing.  They can also be a sign of rough weather.<ref>Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 2, p 19, Dover Publications, New York 1965</ref>

Some mermaids were described as monstrous in size, up to 160 feet.<ref name="briggs"/>

Mermaids could also swim up rivers to freshwater lakes.  One day, in a lake near his house, the Laird of Lorntie saw, as he thought, a woman drowning, and went to aid her; a servant of his pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed after that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant.<ref>K. M. Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'', p 57 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967</ref>

One freshwater mermaid-like creature from European folklore is [[Melusine]], who is sometimes depicted with two fish tails, and other times with the lower body of a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]].  It is said in [[Japan]] that eating the flesh of a mermaid can grant unaging [[immortality]]. In some [[Europe]]an legends mermaids are said to grant wishes.

Also, some people claim they have seen dead or living mermaids in places like [[Scotland]], [[Malaysia]] and [[British Columbia]]. Two recent Canadian reports took place in the [[Strait of Georgia]]. <ref>http://www.tourismvictoria.com/Content/EN/747.asp</ref> <ref>

Mermaids and mermen are also characters of [[Philippine folklore]], where they are locally known as ''[[Philippine mythical creatures|sirena'' and ''siyokoy]]'', respectively.<ref name="TE">"Tagalog-English Dictionary by Leo James English, Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, Manila, distributed by National Book Store, 1583 pages, ISBN 971910550X</ref>

Mermaids are said to be known for their vanity, but also for their innocence. They often fall in love with human men, and are willing to go to great extents to prove their love with humans (see [[mermaid problem]]). Unfortunately, especially younger mermaids, often tend to forget humans cannot breathe underwater. Their male counterparts, [[mermen]], are rarely interested in human issues, but in the [[Finnish mythology]] mermen are able to grant wishes, heal sickness, lift curses and brew magic potions.

According to [[Dorothy Dinnerstein]]’s book, ''The Mermaid and the Minotaur'', human-animal hybrids such as the minotaur and the mermaid convey the emergent understanding of the ancients that human beings were both one with and different from animals and that, as such, humans' "nature is internally inconsistent, that our continuities with, and our differences from, the earth's other animals are mysterious and profound; and in these continuities, and these differences, lie both a sense of strangeness on earth and the possible key to a way of feeling at home here".<ref name=Dinnerstein>

==Representations in Art and Literature==
One influential image was created by [[John William Waterhouse]], from 1895 to 1905, entitled ''A Mermaid'', (see the top of this article). An example of late British Academy style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse's place as a member of the [[Royal Academy]]), but disappeared into a private collection and did not resurface until the 1970s. It is currently in the collection of [[Lord Lloyd-Webber|Andrew Lloyd-Webber]].

[[Image:Zennor_Mermaid_Chair.JPG|thumb|right|100px|[[16th Century]] [[Zennor]] mermaid chair]]

The most famous in more recent centuries is [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairytale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ([[1836]]), which has been translated into many languages.  Andersen's portrayal, immortalized with a famous bronze sculpture in [[Copenhagen]] harbour, has arguably become the standard and has influenced most modern Western depictions of mermaids since it was published.

The most famous musical depictions of mermaids are those by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] in his ''Fair Melusina'' overture and the three "Rhine daughters" in [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]. A more recent depiction in contemporary concert music is ''The Weeping Mermaid'' by Taiwanese composer [[Fan-Long Ko]].

===Representations in Heraldry===
[[Image:POL Warszawa COA 1.svg|thumb|right|100px|Coat of arms of Warsaw]]
In [[heraldry]], the charge of a mermaid is commonly represented with a comb and a mirror, and blazoned as a 'mermaid in her vanity.' Merfolk were used to symbolize eloquence in speech.

A shield and sword-wielding mermaid (''[[Siren|Syrenka]]'') is on the official [[Coat of arms of Warsaw]], the capital of [[Poland]].  The city of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] also uses a mermaid as a symbol, and a civic art project with variously decorated mermaid sculptures has been displayed all over the municipal area.

The personal coat of arms of [[Michaëlle Jean]], Canada's [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], features two [[Simbi]], mermaid-like spirits from [[Haiti]]an [[Vodou]], as [[supporters]].

==Representations in Popular Culture==
{{main|Mermaids in popular culture}}
Like many creatures from mythology and folklore, mermaids appear regularly in popular media. The two most ubiquitous images are surely the [[Walt Disney|Disney]] character based on the tale by Andersen (see "Art and Literature," above) and the logo for the [[Starbucks]] coffee chain, which features a twin-tailed mermaid wearing a crown under a star. In Disney the two-fold nature of mermaids is exploited to tell a [[coming-of-age story]] in which the sea represents childhood and land represents adult life--a place where one stands on one's "own two feet." For most of the story the adolescent heroine is torn between the two worlds. The Starbucks mermaid echoes the nautical implications in the name of the franchise (drawn from the famous Starbuck character in [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'') while the representation itself is indebted to the pictures of mermaids often encountered on the "Star" card in [[Tarot]] decks.

==Hoaxes==
During the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] eras, [[dugong]]s, [[Jenny Haniver|fraud]]s and victims of [[sirenomelia]] were exhibited in [[wunderkammer]]s as mermaids.

In the [[19th century]], [[P. T. Barnum]] displayed in his museum a [[taxidermy|taxidermal]] hoax called the ''[[Fiji mermaid]].'' Others have perpetrated similar hoaxes, which are usually [[papier-mâché]] fabrications or parts of deceased creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together for the appearance of a grotesque mermaid. In the wake of the [[2004 tsunami]], pictures of Fiji "mermaids" were passed around on the internet as something that had washed up amid the devastation, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit.<ref>http://www.snopes.com/photos/tsunami/mermaid.asp</ref>

==Sirenomelia==
[[Sirenomelia]], also called "mermaid syndrome", is a rare [[congenital]] [[disease|disorder]] in which a child is born with his or her legs fused together and the [[Sex organ|genitalia]] are reduced. This condition is about as rare as [[conjoined twins]] and is usually fatal within a day or two of birth because of [[kidney]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] complications. Three survivors are known to be alive today, with one of them, a 19 year old girl, having undergone a successful operation to separate her legs.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
