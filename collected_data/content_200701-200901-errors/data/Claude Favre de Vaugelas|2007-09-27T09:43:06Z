'''Claude Favre de Vaugelas''' ([[January 6]], [[1585]] - February [[1650]]) was a French [[grammar]]ian and man of letters.

Born at [[Meximieux]], in the [[Ain]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' of [[France]], he became gentleman-in-waiting to [[Gaston, Duke of Orleans]], and continued faithful to this prince in his disgrace, although his fidelity cost him a pension from the crown on which he was largely dependent.

His thorough knowledge of the [[French language]] and the correctness of his speech won him a place among the original members of the [[Académie française]] in [[1634]]. On the representation of his colleagues his pension was restored so that he might have leisure to pursue his ''Remarques sur la langue française'' ([[1647]]). In this work he maintained that words and expressions were to be judged by the current usage of the best society, of which, as a regular of the [[Hotel de Rambouillet]], Vaugelas was a competent judge. He shares with [[François de Malherbe]] the credit of having purified French diction. His book fixed the current usage, and the classical writers of the [[17th century]] regulated their practice by it.

Protests against the academical doctrine were not lacking. [[Scipion Dupleix]] in his ''Liberté de la langue française dans sa pureté'' ([[1651]]) pleaded for the richer and freer language of the [[16th century]], and [[François de La Mothe-Le-Vayer]] took a similar standpoint in his ''Lettres à [[Gabriel Naudé]] tombant les Remarques sur la langue française''.

Towards the end of his life Vaugelas became tutor to the sons of [[Thomas Francis of Savoy]], Prince of [[Carignano]]. He died in [[Paris]] in February 1650.

His translation from [[Quintus Curtius]], ''La Vie d'Alexandre'' (posthumously published in [[1653]]) deserves notice as an application of the author's own rules.
