The '''1991 Hamlet chicken plant fire''' took place at the [[Imperial Foods]] chicken processing plant in [[Hamlet, North Carolina|Hamlet]], [[North Carolina]], [[United States|U.S.]], on [[September 3]], [[1991]] after a faulty repair to a hydraulic line. Twenty-five people were killed and fifty-four injured after being trapped behind locked fire doors. The fire resulted in the owner receiving a 20-year [[prison]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]], and the plant never reopened. However, the investigation has also highlighted failings in the authoritive enforcement of existing regulations, and has resulted in a number of safety laws being passed.

==Background==
[[Image:Imperial Plant Front.png|right|width=250px|thumb|A view of the front of the plant, taken shortly after the fire. The door to the right is the main office.]]
The building was eleven years old, although the basic structure dated back to the early 1900s.<ref name="officialreport"/> Previously an [[ice cream]] factory, although it had been used for various food processing aplications,<ref name="officialreport"/> the building was 30,000 square-[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] in size, and was actually a series of adjoining structures.<ref name="UnitVII">[http://www.eduref.org/Virtual/Lessons/crossroads/sec4/Unit_7/Unit_VIIQ10R3.html Describe the working conditions in factories in the late 19th century - Imperial Foods Company Reading] - eduref.org - consisting of two articles originally published by the [[Associated Press]] and two by [[Time Magazine]] - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref> The factory was constructed with bricks and metalwork, and was a single storey high.<ref name="officialreport"/> The interior was a "maze of large rooms separated by moveable walls",<ref name="UnitVII"/> and both workers and the product moved around the interior from process to process, going from front to rear.<ref name="UnitVII"/> Imperial's owners usually kept the doors of the chicken plant padlocked and the windows boarded-up.<ref name="Organica">[http://www.organicanews.com/news/article.cfm?story_id=103 Hamlet: the Untold Tragedy] - Organica News - Obtained January 29, 2007.</ref> This was done to prevent people from stealing chickens, vandalizing the premises and/or committing other petty criminal acts - a decision that was to later have fatal consequences. There had been no safety inspections by the state due to a lack of inspectors.<ref name="emergency.com"/> However, the poultry inspector had visited the site daily, and was aware of the various fire violations as well as the fact that much of the chicken meat was found to be rotten, and that the reason it was processed into [[chicken nuggets]] was to disguise the foul taste. However, for unknown reasons, he did not report these violations.<ref name="Organica"/><ref name="chicken nuggets">[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0203/p02s01-usgn.html Lessons from a factory fire] - The Christian Science monitor - Obtained January 30, 2007.</ref> The factory had had three previous non-fatal fires, but despite this, no action was taken to prevent recurrence or to unlock the doors.<ref name="Organica"/> Some workers were made nervous by the locked doors, but did not voice their concerns for fear of losing their jobs.<ref name="UnitVII"/>

The company always had a poor safety record, although it had had no previous fatal accidents. It was cited in the 1980s after safety violations in its plant at [[Moosic]], [[Pennsylvania]] were discovered. These included poorly marked or blocked emergency exits.<ref name="safety record">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDD1138F935A2575AC0A967958260 Company in Fatal Fire Cited in Third State] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained February 2, 2007.</ref> The offending factory had been closed by the time of the fire. Also, in its plant at [[Cumming, Georgia|Cumming]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], it had two major fires, one of which, in [[1989]], caused [[United States Dollar|$]]1.2 million worth of damage.<ref name="safety record"/>

[[Image:Imperial Foods Front and Side.png|left|width=250px|thumb|Another view of the plant from front and side, taken at the same time, showing the loading facility and giving a good general view of the building.]]
This particular plant was also less than ideal. The plant tended to have a workload of one hundred chickens a minute, and this high rate of speed kept temperatures low, leading to many workers contracting [[parrot fever]], a type of [[pneumonia]]<ref name="WisCOSH">[http://www.wiscosh.org/work.htm Work : It Can Be dangerous to Your Health] - Wisconsin Committee on Occupational Safety and Health - Obtained on February 2, 2007.</ref> There was also a high rate of repetitive motion injuries, and an average of 23% of workers fell seriously ill or were badly injured every year.<ref name="WisCOSH"/>

There was a general lack of flammable materials throughout the complex, other than some packing materials towards the rear, so an extensive fire was considered unlikely.<ref name="officialreport"/> As a result, there were open spaces between rooms in place of doors, to allow for easy access by [[forklift truck]]s. The only barrier to any of these was curtains of plastic strips between some, to hold in refrigerated air.<ref name="officialreport"/> This allowed for rapid spread of smoke and heat in the deadly blaze. Also, the building's previous use as an ice cream production facility meant that the walls and floor were hard, smooth surfaces, which would severely limit the amount of material that was available to absorb heat and smoke during the fire.<ref name="officialreport"/> The plant had been hit by fires before Imperial took over as well, although these, too, were non-fatal.<ref name="officialreport"/>

==Fire==
[[Image:Imperial Foods Cooker 1.png|right|width=250px|thumb|A view of the cooker vat where the fire started.]]
The fire began when a twenty-five [[foot (unit of length)|foot]] long [[deep fat fryer]] [[vat]] apparently [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously ignited]] at around 8:30 AM.<ref name="emergency.com">[http://www.emergency.com/nc-fire.htm FIRE VIOLATIONS KILL TWENTY-FIVE IN CHICKEN PLANT] - emergency.com - Obtained on January 18 2007.</ref> This cooker was temperature controlled via thermostat and was maintained at a constant 375 degrees fahrenheit, variable by design by fifteen degrees either way.<ref name="officialreport"/> There were ninety employees in the facility at the time. There were no [[sprinkler]]s in the building,<ref name="Organica"/> so the fire spread rapidly, causing trauma-related injuries to some of the survivors as they rushed to escape.<ref name="emergency.com"/> Large quantities of thick, acrid smoke were produced by a combination of burning [[soybean oil]] and chicken, and melting roof insulation. One worker later described being overtaken by this smoke while running at full speed to the rear of the facility.<ref name="UnitVII"/> The smoke was later found to be [[hydrocarbon]]-charged, and therefore had the potential to disable someone within a few breaths.<ref name="officialreport"/> The facility also contained a quantity of [[asbestos]], and had no [[fire alarm]] system to warn workers further back in the plant.<ref name="no fire alarm">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616FD3A5A0C738DDDAA0894DA494D81 Chicken Plant Operators Indicted] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained February 2, 2007.</ref><ref name="Organica"/> Several gas lines embedded in the ceiling also caught fire and exploded.<ref name="fedlock">[http://www.fedlock.com/public_relations/Still_Burning.htm Still Burning] - www.fedlock.com - Obtained February 3, 2007.</ref>

[[Image:Imperial Foods Cooker 2.png|left|width=250px|thumb|The same cooker, viewed from further back to give a better view of the general area. Note the heavy damage to the metal roof girders, testimony to the extreme heat of the fire.]]Workers attempted to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; casualties were high, with twenty-five fatalities; in addition, fifty-four people received injuries such as severe [[burns]], [[blindness]], respiratory disease from [[smoke inhalation]], [[neurology|neurological]] and [[brain damage]], and [[post traumatic stress disorder]].<ref name="emergency.com"/><ref name="Organica"/> Of the fatally injured, eighteen were female and seven were male.<ref name="officialreport"/> Many of the survivors either died early deaths from their injuries or still suffer the effects, and others have become [[addiction|addicted]] to their medication, or to [[alcohol]].<ref name="fedlock"/> Those who were able to escape unharmed worked in the front of the building, and escaped through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke.<ref name="UnitVII"/> The rest of the survivors escaped via a loading bay. The bay was originally blocked by a [[tractor-trailer truck]], but three workers went into the rear of the truck and pounded on the walls until they were heard by rescuers, who moved the vehicle.<ref name="UnitVII"/> Others were able to escape when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, although for many the open doors came too late.<ref name="fedlock"/> The injured were sent to several different hospitals for treatment for their injuries. One of the deceased worked for an external company and was resuplying the on-site vending machines; no-one even realised he was inside the plant until the company he worked for reported his truck as missing.<ref name="AFSCME">[http://www.afscme.org/publications/2718.cfm Elements of an Emergency Action Plan] - [[AFSCME]] - Obtained February 6, 2007.</ref> The fire remains the worst disaster ever to strike North Carolina.<ref name="UnitVII"/>

==Emergency response==
[[Image:Imperial Floor Plan.png|right|width=1000px|thumb|Floor plan of the factory, showing location of the origin of the fire, and of the killed and injured. Click image to enlarge.]]
The emergency response was slow to start because the telephones inside the building could not be used, so the owner's son drove down to the fire station and informed them there that the factory was on fire, but neglected to say that workers were still in the plant.<ref name="fedlock"/> Over 100 medical and emergency service personnel attended the scene,<ref name="emergency.com"/> some of whom ran from a local hospital, and nearby towns provided [[air ambulance|emergency evacuation for the wounded via four helicoptors]] from the local hospital to nearby burns units, although they did not attend the scene itself.<ref name="officialreport"/> The emergency response has, however, come under heavy criticism in the aftermath of the blaze. Fire Chief Fuller, in charge of the emergency response, refused help several times from nearby Dobbins Heights fire department, located just five minutes drive away. The department was comprised of [[African-American]] [[Volunteer fire department|volunteers]], and there have been allegations that there was racial prejudice on the part of the [[Fire Chief]], especially since the workers were also of an ethnic minority.<ref name="Organica"/> However, Fuller has defended his decision, saying at the time he refused assistance he did not realize the doors were locked, and adding "In a fire like this you need good, seasoned people."<ref name="Organica"/> Witnesses have also said that there were only two oxygen tanks on site, hopelessly inadequate for the large number of casualties.<ref name="Organica"/>


For the purposes of the investigation, Fuller was asked to evaluate the emergency response. He told investigators that he felt there were "more than adequate numbers of personnel and equipment given the layout of the incident site."<ref name="officialreport"/>

==Immediate aftermath==
[[Image:Imperila Foods Ariel View.png|left|width=250px|thumb|A view of the plant taken from an ariel ladder accross the street, showing a collapsed section of roof directy above the origin of the fire.]]It was immediately clear that the workers had been trapped by locked fire doors, garnering much controversy. A spokesman for the company admitted that "certain doors" in the plant were locked at "certain times", but refused to elaborate on which doors.<ref name="emergency.com"/> Clark Staten, of the [[Emergency Response and Research Institute]] in [[Chicago]] said in response to the blaze, "If the initial reports can be believed, this is an intolerable set of circumstances that should result in criminal charges being placed against those responsible for having the fire doors locked... Our past experience with fires and fire deaths shows that we must ensure an adequate number of open exits from any occupied building... It's hard to believe, in today's day and age that any business owner or manager would be so insensitive to fire safety as to allow this sort of incident to happen."<ref name="emergency.com"/>

The Imperial processing facility in Cumming, Georgia was shut down for 24 hours immediately after the fire, when a resulting inspection by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] found an inoperative sprinkler system, "improper" fire exits and a total lack of any kind of [[evacuation plan]].<ref name="safety record"/> Imperial Foods were told that the plant posed an "imminent danger" to workers because it lacked an automatic fire extinguisher over the cooker similar to the one installed in the Hamlet plant, which failed to prevent the disaster, but did prevent the oil in the vat from catching fire.<ref name="imminent danger">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20613FE3B540C758CDDA00894D9494D81 U.S. Tells Poultry Processor Its Plant in Georgia Poses Risks] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained February 2, 2007.</ref><ref name="officialreport"/>

==Investigation==  
An investigation was immediately launched by state investigators, who were joined one month later by federal ones.<ref name="fed. investigators">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FB3E5C0C778EDDA90994D9494D81 U.S. Agents to Join Carolina Safety Inspectors] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained on February 2, 2007.</ref> Investigators found indentations left on at least one door by people attempting to kick it down.<ref name="emergency.com"/> They also discovered concentrations of bodies around [[fire exits]].<ref name="emergency.com"/> There was also a concentration inside a large [[walk in freezer]], where panicked workers had sought shelter. Some sources say they instead quickly froze to death, in temperatures as low as minus 28 degrees.<ref name="UnitVII"/> However, the official report into the fire states that they were in fact killed by smoke filtration around the door, which hadn't been shut properly.<ref name="officialreport"/> A total of twelve fatalities occured in this area, but five people did survive in the freezer, albeit with injuries.<ref name="officialreport"/> The investigation concluded that the high number of deaths and injuries were caused by the locked fire doors; doors that weren't locked were blocked by parked vehicles.<ref name="WisCOSH"/> Timothy Bradly, then North Carolina's Deputy Commissioner of Insurance, said that technicaly "There was not a single door in the plant that met the criteria of a fire exit."<ref name="WisCOSH"/>

[[Image:Failed Hydraulic Line.png|right|width=250px|thumb|The remains of the failed hydraulic line. Note the seperated end connector lying on the bench]]The fire was caused by failure of a [[hydraulic]] line, which powered a [[conveyor belt]] which supplied the cooker vat. The original line had developed a leak, so it was replaced by a maintenance worker. The line it was to be replaced with was a [[mass production|mass produced]] factory line, and was longer than was necessary, causing it to snake across the floor in a fashion that was determined to pose a hazard of tripping.<ref name="officialreport"/> The worker therefore requested and received permission to cut the line down to the required size. He did so, and then replaced the factory end connector with the original end connector from the failed line, before recoupling the line to the conveyor.<ref name="officialreport"/> The line was rated to 3,000 psi, while normal operating pressure never fluctuated higher than 1,500 psi.<ref name="officialreport"/> When the line was brought up to normal operating pressure, the line separated from this end connector at somewhere between 800 and 1,500 psi, and [[hydraulic fluid]] was forced out at this pressure at an elevation of four to six feet above the concrete floor.<ref name="officialreport">[http://www.interfire.org/res_file/pdf/Tr-057.pdf Chicken Processing Plant Fires
Hamlet, North Carolina (September 3, 1991) and North Little Rock, Arkansas (June 7, 1991)] - [[United States Fire Administration]] report - obtained February 6, 2007.</ref> This fluid spattered onto the heating plumbs for the cooker, and was immediately vaporised. This vapour then went directly into the flame of the gas-fired cooker.<ref name="officialreport"/> The vapor had a relatively low [[flashpoint]], and erupted into a fireball.<ref name="officialreport"/> The ruptured hydraulic line went on to pump a total of fifty to fifty-five [[gallon]]s of hydraulic fluid into the fire before electrical failure shut it down.<ref name="officialreport"/>

A state-of-the-art automatic [[carbon dioxide]] [[fire extinguisher]] designed to cope with such fires had been installed over the vat after a non-fatal fire in [[1983]] at the fire department's request. This prevented the oil itself from igniting until the later stages of the fire.<ref name="UnitVII"/><ref name="WisCOSH"/><ref name="officialreport"/>

Some of the blame was also laid upon the authorities. The state Labor Secretary at the time, [[John Brooks]], blamed his department's failure to inspect the plant on shortage of money and staff, but also blamed Federal government for not enforcing stricter standards.<ref name="blame on authorites">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20613FF38580C768CDDA00894D9494D81 North Carolina Examines Inspection Lapses in Fire] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained February 2, 2007.</ref>

==Criminal prosecution==
===Prosecution of the owners===
Emmett J. Roe, owner of Imperial Foods Products inc., his son Brad, who was operations manager for the company, and plant manager James N. Hair all surrendered to face prosecution on [[March 13]] [[1992]], and were charged with non-negligent [[manslaughter]].<ref name="NYT2">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDE1731F930A25750C0A964958260 3 Surrender in Plant Fire] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref> There was no trial. Instead, on [[September 15]], [[1992]] owner Roe senior pleaded guilty to 25 counts of involuntary manslaughter, while his son and another man went free as part of a [[plea bargain]] agreement. It was Roe who had personally ordered the doors to be locked from the outside.<ref name="VA-Pilot">[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950126/01260568.htm OWNER OF HAMLET PLANT IS UP FOR PAROLE] - scholar.lib.vt.edu (originally published by Knight-Rider Newspapers) - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref><ref name="UnitVII"/> He received a prison sentence of aproximatly 19 years and 11 months, although the exact amount is disputed between various sources.<ref name="prosecution">Henry, Stuart; Mark M. Lanier (1998). Essential Criminology, p. 1.</ref><ref name="Organica"/><ref name="NYT">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10610F63C550C768DDDA00894DA494D81&showabstract=1 Meat-Plant Owner Pleads Guilty In a Blaze That Killed 25 People] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref><ref name="VA-Pilot"/> The sentence is unpopular among many of the workers and their families, who point out that it amounts to less than a year for each dead person.<ref name="VA-Pilot"/> He first became eligible for [[parole]] in [[March 1994]], and was ultimately released just under four years into his sentence, another fact unpopular with victims of the disaster.<ref name="VA-Pilot"/><ref name="fedlock"/>

===Prosecution of Imperial Foods===
Imperial Foods themselves, as a company, whilst not strictly speaking prosecuted, were fined a total of [[United States Dollar|$]]808,150 over the incident, for offences such as the locked doors and inadequate [[emergency light|emergency lighting]]. The amount is comparatively small compared to [[federal law|federal]] penalties that can total millions because the state administers its own safety programme.<ref name="UnitVII"/> It is thought that were the Occupational Safety and Health Administration responsible the fines would have totaled between $2.8 million and $10 million.<ref name="WisCOSH"/> Despite this, the fine was still the highest in the history of North Carolina.<ref name="fedlock"/>

===References as a textbook example===

The disaster and subsequent prosecution have been used as textbook cases. One such book states:
<blockquote>
...the case of the Imperial chicken plant in Hamlet, North Carolina, where twenty-five deaths occurred when the factory caught fire. Imperial's owners had padlocked the plant's fire exits to stop petty pilfering of chicken; each of the owners received a ten-year prison sentence for non-negligent manslaughter. -''Henry, Stuart; Mark M. Lanier ([[1998]]). ''[[Essential Criminology]]'', p. 1.''</blockquote>

The incident is also the basis of a chapter in ''Political Crime in Contemporary America: a Critical Approach'' (1993).<ref>Aulette, J.R. & Michaelowski, R. (1993). "Fire in Hamlet: a Case Study of State-Corporate Crime" in ''Political Crime in Contemporary America: a Critical Approach'', (ed. Tunnell, K). New York: Garland (pp.171-206).</ref>

==Long-term aftermath==
After the fire, the factory was permanently closed, with the loss of 215 jobs.<ref name="VA-Pilot"/> Within two years of the accident, [[Insurance company|insurance companies]] and the North Carolina [[business lobby]] collaboratively introduced legislation to severely limit the compensation available to injured workers and the relatives of the deceased.<ref name="Organica"/> Insurance companies had originally agreed to pay $16.1 million to the injured and the families of the deceased.<ref name="$16.1 million">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616FF3B590C7B8CDDA80994DA494D81 Victims of Poultry-Plant Fire to Get $16.1 Million] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained January 31, 2007.</ref> Some of the workers became activists as a result, to fight what they see as "bureaucratic injustice." They had originally hired [[John Coale]], an [[attorney]] who had worked on the [[Bhopal disaster]], but he could not legally practice in NC.<ref name="Organica"/>

On [[January 9]], 1992, the then [[Labor Secretary]] [[Lynn Martin]] told North Carolina state officials that they had a deadline of 90 days to improve enforcement of [[health and safety|job safety and health regulations]] or federal agencies would take over.<ref name="NC told to improve enforcement of job safety and health regulations">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10617FC395D0C7A8CDDA80894DA494D81 North Carolina Is Told to Improve Safety Role] - [[New York Times]] - Obtained on February 2, 2007.</ref> The [[North Carolina General Assembly]] passed a number of new worker safety laws as a result.<ref name="fedlock"/>

Two separate monuments were erected due to a dispute. Many of the workers and their families wanted the Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]] to speak in the city's memorial effort. But then mayor [[Abbie Covington]] didn't want him involved, and was backed up by many other local authority figures.<ref name="fedlock"/> The argument is often seen as being discriminatory on the grounds of race or class.<ref name="fedlock"/> The result was that a group of the survivors held their own service, separate to that provided by the authorities, which included Jesse. Both services unveiled near-identical monuments, which are situated just 50 [[yard]]s from each other.<ref name="fedlock"/>

Many firefighters also suffered psychological problems after the fire, as due to the small size of the community many of the firefighters knew some or all of the victims. Fifty to sixty of them attended counseling sessions as a result.<ref name="officialreport"/>

A memorial service was held in [[2000]], but by then many survivors had passed away, mostly due to complications from their injuries.<ref name="fedlock"/> The burned-out shell of the factory remained for many years, but eventually it was bulldozed by the state in [[2001]], after they declared it "a public health nuisance", due to the [[psychology|psychological]] impact it had on the victims, many of whom still lived within sight of the structure.<ref name="fedlock"/>
