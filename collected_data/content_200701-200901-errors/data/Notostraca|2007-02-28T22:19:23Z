The [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Notostraca''' (colloquially referred to as '''notostracans''', called '''''Triops''''', '''tadpole shrimp''' or '''shield shrimp''') are small [[crustacean]]s in the [[Class (biology)|class]] [[Branchiopoda]].  Triops have two internal [[compound eye|compound eyes]] and one [[naupliar ]] eye in-between, a flattened [[carapace]] covering its head and [[arthropod leg|leg]]-bearing [[body segment|segments of the body]]. The order contains a single [[family (biology)|family]], with only two [[extant]] [[genus|genera]]. Their external morphology has apparently not changed since the [[Triassic]] appearance of ''Triops cancriformis'' around 220 million years ago. ''Triops cancriformis'' may therefore be the "oldest living animal species on earth"&nbsp;<ref>Kelber, K.-P. (1999). ''Triops cancriformis'' (Crustacea, Notostraca): Ein bemerkenswertes Fossil aus der Trias Mitteleuropas. — ''In'': Hauschke, N. & Wilde, V. (''eds.''): Trias - Eine ganz andere Welt, '''III.16''': ''383-394''. Verl. Dr. F. Pfeil, Munich.</ref>.

==Ecology==
Tadpole  shrimps usually live near the ground of astatic pools, where they move with their [[ventral]] side down. However, [[hypoxia (environmental)|lack of oxygen]] can force them to swim upside-down with their gill-like legs close under the surface of the water. Notostraca are [[omnivore|omnivorous]]; they dig around in the mud using the frontal part of their shield, looking not only for [[plankton]] but also for larger prey such as [[worm]]s, [[chironomid]] [[larva]]e and even weak [[tadpole]]s. [[Fairy shrimp|Anostraca]]ns, often associated with notostracans, can also be a considerable part of their prey (especially when weak or dying).

Notostracans sometimes even [[cannibalism|cannibalise]] freshly [[ecdysis|moulted]] members of the same species. In [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[central Europe]], with few exceptions, all tadpole shrimps are female, whereas the sexes in [[Southern Europe|southern]] and [[western Europe]] as well as in northern [[Africa]] are nearly equal in number. These "females" possess hermaphroditic glands, but instead of selfing, [[parthenogenesis]] takes place. Modified [[appendage]]s of the 11th pair of limbs bear the ovisacs with the mature [[egg (biology)|eggs]].

''Triops'' survives in temporary pools all over the world, and are correspondingly short-lived. These ponds usually dry up during certain times of the year when there is no rainfall. Although the adult ''Triops'' die during these droughts, their embryos remain in a state of [[diapause]] (suspended animation) and can survive for several years until the next rains fill up the pools again, allowing them to hatch. Diapause was first discovered  by a German scientist.

''Triops'' are often the [[Apex predator|top predators]] in [[vernal pool]]s, and they will eat anything smaller than themselves. They also are an important food source for visiting birds. In some areas, certain species of ''Triops'' are considered pests, as they damage young [[rice|rice plants]].

The [[maximum life span]]s in the lab agree with data from field observations on ''Triops'' survival. In the lab, ''T. longicaudatus'' has a maximum lifespan of about 50 days and ''T. cancriformis'' a maximum lifespan of about 90 days, with some individuals beginning to die off as soon as two weeks after [[hatching]]. Secondarily, some may suffer premature deaths from [[ecdysis|moulting]] complications or other reasons.

==Distribution==

Notostracans can be found on every continent except [[Antarctica]].

In [[Austria]], two notostracan species (one spring species and one summer species) are documented: ''Lepidurus apus'' and ''Triops cancriformis''. In [[Americas|the Americas]], several species have been identified, including ''Triops longicaudatus'' and ''Triops newberryi''. In [[Australia]], ''Triops australiensis'' is found. Other common types are ''Triops numidicus'' from Africa, although it has been said that some papers refer to this as an outdated name for ''Triops granarius'', which is from South Africa, China, Japan and Italy&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/channum/triops_species2.htm |title=Species descriptions |date=2001 |accessdate=2006-07-31}}</ref>. ''Triops cancriformis'' is also found in Britain, but is endangered, occurring only in pools in two areas, one in [[England]] at [[New Forest]] and one in [[Scotland]] at [http://www.wwt.org.uk/visit/caerlaverock/ Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust Caerlaverlock], which is near [[Dumfries]].

== Etymology of the word "Triops"==
"Triops" is originally a [[Greek language|Greek]] phrase, meaning "three eyes." Notostracans, indeed, have three eyes.The two compound eyes look out for food or predators, but they can only see clearly for a short distance.  The naupliar  ocellus senses light, acting as an internal "compass".(In their natural habitat, the sun shines from above,  therefore the animals believe that light is where "up" is.) . The [[English language]] borrowed the word. Both the singular and plural is ''Triops''.&nbsp;<ref>[http://mytriops.com/]</ref>

===Notostracans in the aquarium===

Notostracans are often sold to children in small packets as eggs as an interesting science project or as a beginner's kit for their first [[aquarium]]. One pours distilled or spring water onto the eggs, and they will hatch out very quickly--often within less than a day. They will also grow at a remarkable pace; growth is actually noticeable from one day to the next until they reach their maxiumum size of approximately 2 inches, including their caudal appendages. If food is not available in plenty--and sometimes even if it is--they will not hesitate to eat each other.

These creatures can make a useful addition to a freshwater aquarium, as they keep the substrate very clean and eat almost anything they find. They may, however pose a slight danger to very small fish or other crustaceans, and may in turn be eaten by large fish. Also, they may damage the roots of aquarium plants they encounter if not kept well fed. They are also very short-lived pets, but are easily replaceable.
