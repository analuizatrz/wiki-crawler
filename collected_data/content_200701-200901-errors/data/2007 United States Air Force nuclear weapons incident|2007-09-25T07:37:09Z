The '''2007 United States Air Force Bent Spear incident''' was an incident at [[Minot Air Force Base]] in which six "live" [[AGM-129 ACM]] [[cruise missile]]s (each armed with a [[W80|W80-1]] [[variable yield]] [[nuclear warhead]]) were mistakenly loaded on a [[B-52H]] [[heavy bomber]] in place of six unarmed AGM-129 missiles that were awaiting transport to [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] for disposal. The live missiles were not reported missing, and stood unsecured and unguarded while mounted to the aircraft for a period of 36 hours.

The transport was to have consisted of 12 unarmed AGM-129 missiles, installed with blue dummy warheads, with three missiles per pylon mounted on the two underwing pylons. The flight officer who conducted the inspection at Minot before takeoff only closely inspected the six missiles on the right wing, which were all properly unarmed, before signing the manifest listing the cargo as a dozen unarmed AGM-129 missiles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Warrick| first = Joby| coauthors = Walter Pincus| year = September 23, 2007| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2007/09/23/ST2007092300048.html?sid=ST2007092300048| title = Missteps in the Bunker| format =| work = The Washington Post| accessdate = 2007-09-24}}</ref>

The AGM-129 ACM is a "stealth missile" incorporating a low-observable radar-absorbent paint scheme which prevents use of the traditional colored marking bands or stenciling used to identify different missile "loads", rendering the missiles externally identical. Thus, the only available external method for easily determining the missile's current status is to directly look at the warhead through a postage-stamp sized Plexiglas window on the casing; the normal W80 Mod-1 warhead is polished silver, whereas the dummy warhead inserted into de-armed missiles (to maintain weight balance) is blue in color. 

The live nuclear missiles were mounted on the left wing pylons of a B-52H, left unsecured and without special guard for more than 15 hours, then flown from [[Minot Air Force Base]] to Barksdale Air Force Base. The missiles were then left mounted on the B-52H overnight for a period of 9 hours. The missiles were not reported as missing until discovered by the Barksdale AFB ground crews the next morning.

The incident was reported to the [[National Military Command Center]] as a [[Bent Spear]] incident, which indicates a nuclear weapon incident that is of significant concern, but does not involve the immediate threat of nuclear war ([[United_States_military_nuclear_incident_terminology|Pinnacle - Nucflash]]) or the accidental detonation of or severe damage to a nuclear weapon ([[Broken Arrow|Pinnacle - Broken Arrow]]). The incident would also not qualify as a [[Empty Quiver|Pinnacle - Empty Quiver]] incident, since the weapons were not technically "lost" at any point, having never left US Air Force custody. The incident was the first of its kind in 40 years in the United States.
