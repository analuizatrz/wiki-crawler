==Biography==

===Early life===
McDiarmid was born in [[Carnoustie, Angus|Carnoustie]]. He became a theatre aficionado when he was five years old, when his father took him to see an act by the name of ''Tommy Morgan'' in a theatre located in [[Dundee]]. In 2001 he stated, "It sort of fascinated me, and it also scared me. All those lights, all that make-up. I said to myself, 'I don't know what this is, but I want it.'"<ref name=Simonchange>{{cite web | author=Simon Hattenstone | title=Force for change | date=2001-12-17 | work=The Guardian | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,620076,00.html | accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref> However, fearing his father's disapproval, McDiarmid attended the [[University of St Andrews]], where he received an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|M.A.]] in [[psychology]]. Soon after, he decided to pursue a career in the theatre instead, and took acting training courses at the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] in [[Glasgow]]. In 1968, McDiarmid received a [[gold medal]] for his work. This would later prove to be the first of many recognitions given to him for his work in the theatre. McDiarmid claimed he became its recipient "by doing all the boring jobs you have to do when you are young, to eke out an existence."<ref>[http://www.nerf-herders-anonymous.net/IanMcDiarmid.html/ Star Wars Actors Database at Nerf-Herders-Anonymous.net]; last accessed [[August 23]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Theatre ===
McDiarmid is renowned for his work in [[United Kingdom|British]] theatre, having won plaudits as an actor and director from a wide variety of sources. He has starred in a variety of [[Shakespearean]] plays, including ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1972), ''[[The Tempest]]'' (1974, 2000), ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1976), ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1984), and ''[[King Lear]]'' (2005). While at the Almeida, he directed plays such as ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]'' (1986) and ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'' (1991).<ref name="IanBroadway"> Ian McDiarmid's stage credits at [http://www.broadway.com/gen/Buzz_Star_File.aspx?ci=531308 Broadway.com]; last accessed [[November 27]] [[2006]].</ref>

He also played the part of Ivanov in [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Every Good Boy Deserves Favour]]'' at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] in 1978.

In 2001, McDiarmid won Almeida Theatre's Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his role as Teddy in a [[Revival (play)|revival]] of [[Brian Friel]]'s ''[[Faith Healer]]''. Five years later in 2006, he reprised this role in his debut on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=HorwitzNewRole>{{cite web |author=Simi Horwitz |title=The Emperor's New Role |date=2001-09-05 |work=BackStage |url=http://backstage.com/bso/news_reviews/features/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002577371&imw |accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref> Directed by Kent, he performed alongside [[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Cherry Jones]], and won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play]].<ref name="IanHollywood"> Ian McDiarmid at [http://www.hollywood.com/celebs/fulldetail/id/195431 Hollywood.com]; last accessed [[October 23]] [[2006]].</ref> He has appeared most recently in the title role of ''[[John Gabriel Borkman]]'', running at the Donmar Theatre in [[London]].

One theatrical performance of note is his portrayal of Harry Hackamore in [[Sam Shepard]]'s play ''Seduced''. By McDiarmid's own description, Hackamore was a [[Howard Hughes]]-type character. To play the part, he was made-up in [[prosthetic]]s, including a false beard and long fingernails, to resemble Hackamore. McDiarmid was only 37 at the time, and this convinced [[George Lucas]] and [[Richard Marquand]] that he could convincingly play a much older character in extreme cinematic close-up, which helped him land the role of Palpatine.<ref name=IanDatabase>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001519/bio Ian McDiarmid at the Internet Movie Database]; last accessed [[August 26]] [[2006]].</ref>

From 1990 until 2001, McDiarmid and Jonathan Kent served as the artistic directors of the Almeida Theatre, located in [[Islington]], [[London]]. In 1998 they shared the Special Evening Standard Award for Theatrical Achievement of the Year.<ref name="IanHollywood"/> Their tenure was marked by a string of highly successful performances involving 'big name' actors usually seen in films such as [[Kevin Spacey]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]].<ref name=GibbonsCelebrated>{{cite web |author=Fiachra Gibbons |title=Celebrated double act quits Almeida theatre |date=2001-09-05 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,546925,00.html |accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref>

===''Star Wars''===
{{further|[[Palpatine#Ian_McDiarmid_on_Palpatine|Ian McDiarmid on Palpatine]]}}
Though McDiarmid believes himself to be first and foremost a stage actor, he is happy to work in a film for the right part.<ref name=IanDatabase>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001519/bio Ian McDiarmid at the Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> After a minor part in the film ''[[Dragonslayer]]'', McDiarmid was cast by George Lucas in ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' as Emperor Palpatine, the principal villain. Sixteen years after appearing in ''Return of the Jedi'', he reprised the role as a younger Senator and [[Supreme Chancellor|Chancellor]] in the ''Star Wars'' prequel films. He attributes the opportunity to reprise his role to having been much younger than his character the first time he played the part. 

The prequels had him play two faces to his character; he re-created his diabolical interpretation of Palpatine from ''Return of the Jedi'' when playing Darth Sidious, the Chancellor's [[Sith Lord|Sith]] [[alter ego]], but created an attractive, pleasant, and seductive character in Palpatine's public persona. While he had previously achieved little recognition for this role, due to the extensive prosthetics used for the character which made him unrecognizable, he received widespread attention and critical acclaim for his expanded role in the prequels.<ref name=IanHollywood/> 

In the [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#2004 Star Wars trilogy|2004 re-release]] of ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'', a brief scene between [[Darth Vader]] and a [[hologram]] of Emperor Palpatine was updated to have him depicted by McDiarmid (the Emperor was originally voiced by [[Clive Revill]] for that scene, and visually depicted by superimposing the eyes of a [[chimpanzee]] on the face of an old woman).<ref name="PalpatineDatabank">Palpatine, at the [http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/palpatine/?id=bts/ Star Wars Databank]; last accessed [[October 22]], [[2006]].</ref> With this addition to ''The Empire Strikes Back'', McDiarmid has now appeared in every film version in which Palpatine appears.

===TV and radio ===
McDiarmid took an early role as Mickey Hamilton, a killer intent on avenging the death of his wife and child in ''[[The Professionals]]'' for Granada TV. He played the role of police detective Porfiry Petrovich in the BBC's 2002 TV adaptation of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', also starring in an episode of ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' several years earlier, as murderous conman Hugo DeVries. In 2003 McDiarmid took the role of the Stuart statesman [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], in the BBC series ''[[Charles II: The Power and The Passion]]''.

In 2005, he portrayed the part of [[Satan]] in the 41 part [[BBC Four]] [[radio drama]] based on [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', which was subsequently re-broadcast on [[BBC7]].<ref name=PLost>{{cite web |author= Ed Pettit |title=Of Man's first disobedience | date=2006-11-23 | url=http://bibliothecary.squarespace.com/blog/2006/11/23/of-mans-first-disobedience.html | accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> Recently, he played the writer and pioneer of policing, [[Henry Fielding]], in the Channel 4 historical drama series ''[[City of Vice]]''.
