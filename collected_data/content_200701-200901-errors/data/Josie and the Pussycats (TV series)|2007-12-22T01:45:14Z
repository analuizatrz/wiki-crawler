'''''Josie and the Pussycats''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] produced for [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning television]] by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in [[1970 in television|1970]] for [[CBS]]. In [[1972 in television|1972]], Hanna-Barbera produced a spin-off called '''''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space,''''' which ran until [[1974 in television|1974]]. Based upon the [[Archie Comics]] [[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|series of the same name]] created by [[Dan DeCarlo]], ''Josie and the Pussycats'' featured an all-girl pop music band that toured the world with their entourage, getting mixed up in strange adventures, spy capers, and mysteries. The show, more similar to Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' rather than the original ''Josie'' comic book, is famous for its music, the girls' leopard print [[leotard]]s (replete with "long tails and ears for hats," as the theme song states), and for featuring the first regularly appearing [[African American|black]] character in a Saturday morning cartoon show. <ref>Charles, Don. Long Tails and Ears for Hats: The Story of Josie and The Pussy Cats.</ref>

==Creation and development==
===Origins===
During the [[1968 in television|1968]] - [[1969 in television|1969]] television season, the first ''[[Archie Comics|Archie]]''-based Saturday morning cartoon, ''[[The Archie Show]],'' was a huge success, not only in the ratings on [[CBS]], but also on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts: [[The Archies]]' song "[[Sugar, Sugar]]" hit the #1 spot on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts in September 1969.  Animation studio [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] wanted to duplicate the success their competitors [[Filmation]] were having with ''[[The Archie Show]]''. After a failed attempt at developing a teenage-music-band show of their own called ''Mysteries Five'' (which eventually became ''[[Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo, Where are You!]]''), they decided to go to the source and contacted [[Archie Comics]] about possibly adapting one of their remaining properties into a show similar to ''The Archie Show.'' Archie Comics responded by offering to re-develop their comic [[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie]] into a TV series about a teenage music band, allowing Hanna-Barbera to adapt it into a music-based Saturday morning show.

===The music===
''Main entry: [[Josie and the Pussycats (music)]]''

In preparation for the upcoming cartoon series, Hanna-Barbera began working on putting together a real-life [[Josie and the Pussycats (music)|Josie and the Pussycats]] girl group, who would provide the singing voices of the girls in the cartoons and also record an album. Many of the songs on the album would be used in the cartoon as well.

The [[Josie and the Pussycats (music)|Josie and the Pussycats]] recordings were produced by La La Productions, run by Danny Janssen and Bobby Young. They held a talent search to find three girls who would match the three girls in the comic book in both looks and singing ability, and, after interviewing over 500 finalists, settled upon casting Kathleen Dougherty (Cathy Dougher) as Josie, [[Cheryl Ladd|Cherie Moor]] (actress Cheryl Ladd) as Melody, and the late [[Patrice Holloway]] as Valerie.

Janssen presented the newly formed band to [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] to finalize the production deal, but was in for a surprise. Hanna-Barbera wanted Janssen to recast Patrice Holloway, because they had decided to portray "Josie and the Pussycats" as an all-white trio and had altered Valerie, who was [[African-American]] in the comic book, to make her white. Janssen refused to recast Holloway and threatened to walk away from the project. After a three-week-long stand-off between Janssen and Hanna-Barbera, Hanna-Barbera finally relented and allowed Janssen to keep Holloway, and changed Valerie back to being African-American. 

Valerie was actually the very first [[African-American]] cast member on a regular Saturday morning cartoon. (In 1969, [[Bill Cosby]]'s [[Fat Albert]] appeared in a one-shot animated prime-time special, but would not get his own show until 1971. During the summer of 1970, CBS aired the Hanna-Barbera animated sitcom ''[[Where's Huddles?]]'' in prime time; this show featured the first African-American character to appear on a regular original animated TV program.)  Valerie only holds this position in history thanks to the CBS scheduling department: ''Josie and the Pussycats'' debuted at 9:30 AM EST on [[September 12]] [[1970]], while another new Hanna-Barbera show, ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'' (on which all but one of its major human characters were African-American) debuted on the same day &mdash; but at 10:00 AM.

==Series overview==
''Josie and the Pussycats'' debuted on the [[CBS]] [[Saturday morning]] lineup on [[September 12]], [[1970]], with the episode "The Nemo's a No-No Affair." The animated version of ''Josie'' was an amalgam of plot devices, villain types, settings, moods, and tones from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''[[Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Space Ghost]]'', and ''[[Shazzan]]''.

Like ''[[Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''Josie and the Pussycats'' contained a [[laugh track]].

===Plot===

Every episode of the show would find the Pussycats (along with Josie's boyfriend and band roadie Alan, their cowardly manager Alexander, Alexander's scheming sister Alexandra, and the equally scheming pet Sebastian the cat) en route to perform a gig or record a song in some exotic location. Somehow (more often than not due to something Alexandra did) they would accidentally find themselves mixed up in an adventure/mystery. The antagonist was always a diabolical mad scientist, spy, or criminal who wanted to take over the world using some hi-tech device. The Pussycats would usually find themselves in possession of the plans for an invention, an item of interest to the villains, a secret spy message, etc., and the villains would give chase.

Towards the end of the episode, the villain would succeed in capturing the Pussycats and would begin executing their diabolical plan to take over the world. The gang would break free (usually thanks to Sebastian), and would proceed to "disconboomerate" (their word) the device/lab and capture the bad guys. This would result in a final chase sequence, set to one of the songs recorded for the Capital Records releases.

The Pussycats would succeed in capturing the villain and get back to their gig/recording session/etc. The final gag always centered around one of Alexandra's attempts to (a) interfere with/put an end to The Pussycats' performance, (b) steal Alan away from Josie, or (c) achieve both at the same time. More often than not, she would enlist Sebastian to carry out her dirty work, and Sebastian would always bumble the job in some way, which would result in Alexandra getting in trouble and/or being made a fool of. Alexandra and Sebastian cat parallel another set of [[comic relief]] villains-[[Dick Dastardly]] and [[Muttley]] from Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Wacky Races]]''. Sebastian even had the same laugh as Muttley, supplied by [[Don Messick]]. 

At least two of the 1970-1972 plots were based on H.G. Wells stories: ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' and the ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]''.

===Style and similarites===
The art styling for the show was a cross between Dan DeCarlo's artwork and Hanna-Barbera's late-1960s adventure shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Space Ghost]]'', and ''[[The Herculoids]]''. ''Josie and the Pussycats'' was somewhat less realistic and more cartoony than ''Scooby-Doo,'' from which much of its tone, [[laugh track]], pacing, and plot elements were derived.  Both shows also feature the same [[Ted Nichols]] background score cues, sound effects and Casey Kasem in the voice cast. Many viewers who are unaware of ''Josie's'' Archie Comics origins would argue that it is a complete rip-off of ''Scooby.'' Also, the animated version of Alexander Cabot III's voice sounded very similar to Shaggy, and Alan looked remarkably like  Fred, respectively, from ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!''. There were some notable differences. Compared to the mysteries in Scooby Doo, Josie and friends found themselves in life or death situations more regularly. The villains encountered by Josie and friends were potentially much deadlier (sometimes using guns) and willing to murder than the relatively tame (only wanting to frighten) villains encountered by the Scooby gang although no one ever got killed on the show. 

Nevertheless, ''Josie and the Pussycats'' was a ratings success for the [[1970]]-[[1971]] TV season. Sixteen episodes were produced, and the series was rerun for the [[1971]]-[[1972]] season.

In September 1972, a spin-off series called ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' debuted on CBS. The gang was lost in [[outer space|space]] (thanks--no surprise--to Alexandra's bumbling) and were trying to return back to Earth.  A typical plot would involve the gang encountering some alien race, being kidnapped by said alien race, escaping, solving the problems the aliens are having (while performing a musical number or two), and then be sent on their way back to Earth by the thankful aliens.  Inevitably, however, Alexandra would find a way (unintentionally) to have them go off-course again. The 16 episodes of ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' were re-run for the [[1973]]-[[1974]] season until [[January 26]] [[1974]], when CBS canceled it and ordered no more new ''Josie'' episodes from Hanna-Barbera.

==Afterlife==
[[Image:ScoobygangPussyCats.JPG|left|thumb|Josie and the Pussycats and the Mystery, Inc. gang from ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' join forces in a 1973 episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', "The Haunted Showboat."]]

Josie and The Pussycats made one last hurrah as animated characters in a guest shot on the September 22, 1973 installment of '' [[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', "The Haunted Showboat." Early production art for 1977's ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' featured Josie and The Pussycats and Jeannie (from the 1973-75 CBS series ''[[Jeannie (animated series)|Jeannie]]'') as members of the "Scooby Doobies" team, but last-minute legal problems prevented it.

In 1976, [[Rand McNally]] published a children's book based on the ''Josie'' TV show, ''Hanna-Barbera's Josie and The Pussycats: The Bag Factory Detour''.

''Josie and the Pussycats'' (but not ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'') was re-run on [[NBC]] Saturday morning for the [[1975]]-[[1976]] season.  In the mid-[[1980s]], both series, along with a number of other 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoons (including ''[[Jabberjaw]]'', ''Jeannie'', and ''[[Help! It's the Hair Bear Bunch]]''), were shown on the [[USA Network]]'s ''USA Kids Club''.  They would next appear on [[Cartoon Network]] in [[1992]] (where all 32 episodes were run in the same timeslot). ''Josie and the Pussycats'' and ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' are often seen today on Cartoon Network's spinoff channel [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]]. A Cartoon Network bumper, called "Musical Evolution", featured the Pussycats performing their theme song through the various eras of pop music, including pop, [[disco]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]-like [[heavy metal]], [[country music|country]], and [[grunge]] (this may have been an inspiration for the similar [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]' video for ''[[Dani California]]''). Different animation styles are used for each era.

In 2001 ''Josie and the Pussycats'' was adapted into a [[Josie and the Pussycats (movie)|live action motion picture]]. The film, produced by [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], was based more on the comic rather than the cartoon series, but a punk rock cover of the popular theme song from the series (written by [[Hoyt Curtin]], [[William Hanna]], and [[Joseph Barbera]]) is featured during the end credits.

==Home video releases==
A [[VHS|VHS videocassette]] of ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' containing 3 episodes was issued by [[Worldvision Enterprises|Worldvision Home Video]] in the early 1980s, and a second videocassette, ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, Volume 2'' was released in 1985. Two VHS volumes of ''Josie and the Pussycats'', each containing four episodes of the original 1970 series, minus their laugh tracks, was released by [[Warner Home Video]] in 2001 to coincide with the release of the live-action film.

A DVD box set of ''Josie and the Pussycats'' was released in [[Region 1]] on [[September 18]], [[2007]].<ref>http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=7349</ref> All sixteen episodes, again minus their laugh tracks, were included, as well as a half-hour documentary on the life and career of DanDeCarlo. There has been no announcement as to a DVD release of ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space''.
