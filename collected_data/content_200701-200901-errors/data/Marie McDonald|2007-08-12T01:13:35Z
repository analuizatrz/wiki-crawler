'''Marie McDonald''' ([[July 6]], [[1923]] â€“ [[October 21]], [[1965]]) was an [[United States|American]] singer and actress born with the name '''Cora Marie Frye''' in [[Burgin, Kentucky]]. She was the daughter of a [[Ziegfeld Follies]] girl who divorced her father when she was a child and she eventually moved with her mother and stepfather to [[Yonkers, New York]]. Marie wanted to pursue a career in journalism but her mother encouraged her to go into show business. She competed in numerous beauty pageants including Miss America. In her early teens Cora Frye began doing [[Model (person)|modeling]] work and was signed by the prominent [[John Robert Powers Agency]] in [[New York City]]. Nicknamed "The Body" because of her shapely physique, she was only seventeen years old when she landed a [[showgirl]] role in a 1940 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production at the [[Earl Carroll Theatre]] called ''Earl Carroll's Vanities.'' Shortly thereafter, she moved to [[Hollywood]] hoping to develop a career in [[show business]]. She continued to work for the owner of the Broadway theatre as a showgirl at his [[Sunset Boulevard]] nightclub.

Marie McDonald's singing voice brought work with [[Tommy Dorsey]] & His Orchestra on his radio show and she later performed with other [[Big band]]s. Seen as a multi-talented young star, in [[1942 in film|1942]] she was put under contract by [[Universal Studios]] and immediately appeared in several minor roles. The following year she co-starred in ''A Scream in the Dark'', a [[B movies|"B"]] detective mystery for [[Republic Pictures]] that met with reasonable success. However, that would be it as far as starring roles until 1945 when she worked for a small independent production company in another "B" film called ''Getting Gertie's Garter''.

During the [[Second World War]], McDonald was a volunteer [[pin-up girl]] for the [[United States military]] magazine, [[YANK]]. She had married for the first time in 1940 but this marriage quickly ended. Her second marriage, to her agent Vic Orsatti, lasted four years. In all, she married seven times, including twice to Harry Karl who later married and bankrupted [[Debbie Reynolds]]. She also had a torrid affair with gangster [[Bugsy Siegel]]. Her personal life was thrown into turmoil by her addictions to alcohol and prescription drugs. She was arrested for drunk driving and later attempted suicide. In 1957 she made headlines by faking her own kidnapping. Between [[1945 in film|1945]] and [[1950 in film|1950]] she appeared in only two films and then again not until [[1958 in film|1958]] when she was cast in a [[slapstick comedy]] opposite [[Jerry Lewis]] in ''[[The Geisha Boy]]'' . Eight years later the 40-year-old McDonald made her last appearance in a "spicy" film, ''[[Promises! Promises!]]'', that featured a topless [[Jayne Mansfield]].

In 1965, at [[Calabasas, California]], 42-year-old Marie McDonald ended her own life with a [[drug overdose]]. She was put to rest in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]] with her last husband, Donald F. Taylor. It is unclear whether Marie committed suicide or whether her death was accidental. Her husband committed suicide in January 1966. Marie's three children were raised by Harry Karl and his new wife, Debbie Reynolds.
