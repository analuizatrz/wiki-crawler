[[Image:BayMare.jpg|thumb|Pasture grazing is a natural source of nutrition for a horse]]
'''Equine nutrition''' refers to the feeding of [[horse]]s, [[pony|ponies]], [[mule]]s, [[donkey]]s and other [[equid]]s. Correct and balanced [[nutrition]] is a critical component of proper [[horse care]].

Horses are [[herbivores]], a type of non-[[ruminant]] known as a "hind-gut fermentor."  What this means is that horses have only one stomach, similar to humans.  However, unlike humans, they also have to digest plant fiber that comes from [[grass]] and [[hay]].  Therefore, unlike [[ruminant]]s, who digest [[fiber]] in plant matter by use of a multichambered [[stomach]], horses use bacterial fermentation that occurs in the organ known as the ''[[cecum]]'' (or ''caecum'') to break down [[cellulose]].  <ref name="Rutgers">[http://www.esc.rutgers.edu/publications/factsheets_nutrition/FS038.htm  Williams, Carey A.,Ph.D., Extension Specialist. "The Basics of Equine Nutrition"  ''from'' FS #038, Equine Science Center, Rutgers University, Revised: April 2004.]  Web site accessed February 9, 2007</ref> 

In practical terms, horses prefer to eat small amounts of food steadily throughout the day, as they do in nature when [[grazing]] on [[pasture]].<ref>[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_13.html "Horse Nutrition - Frequency." Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.] Web site accessed February 9, 2007.</ref>  Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, it is important to remember the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities. 

The digestive system of the horse is somewhat delicate.  Because horses are unable to [[regurgitate]] food, if they overeat or eat something poisonous, [[vomit]]ing is not an option.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Horses are also very susceptible to [[horse colic|colic]], which is a leading cause of death.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Therefore, horses require clean, high-quality feed, provided at regular intervals, and may become ill if subjected to abrupt changes in their diets. <ref name="March">[http://www.auspet.com/horse05.html March, Linda. "Feeding Your Horse To Avoid Problems," ''from'' University of Illinois, College of Veterinary Medicine.] Web site accessed February 16, 2007</ref>  Because horses are also sensitive to molds and  toxins, they must never be fed fermentable materials such as [[silage]]<ref name="Carbohydrates">[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_7.html "Horse Nutrition - Carbohydrates and fats."

==The digestive system==
Horses and other Equids evolved as [[grazing]] animals, adapted to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, the horse adapted to eating [[prairie]] grasses in semi-arid regions and traveling significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition.<ref>Budiansky, Stephen. ''The Nature of Horses.'' Free Press, 1997. ISBN 0-684-82768-9</ref>  

===The mouth===
Digestion begins in the mouth, also called the "oral cavity." The front [[horse teeth|teeth]] of the horse, called [[incisor]]s, clip [[forage]], and horses pick up finer foods, such as grain, with their [[lip]]s. Food is then pushed back in the mouth by the tongue, and ground up for swallowing by the [[premolar]]s and [[molars]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

When swallowing occurs, the [[soft palate]] (a flap of tissue in the back of the mouth) closes over the [[pharynx]] of the animal, which prevents food from going down the [[trachea]], but momentarily prevents the horse from being able to breathe. This soft palate is also the reason why horses cannot breathe through their mouth when they are in respiratory distress.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
 
===The esophagus===
The [[esophagus]] is about 4-5 feet in length, and carries food to the stomach. Due to the [[coronary sphincter]], the esophagus only allows the passage of food in one direction, and this is why horses cannot [[vomit]]. It is also the area of the digestive tract where horses get [[choke (horse)|choke]], or ''esophageal obstruction'', due to eating something that is too large or dry to pass down the length of the esophagus. Therefore, unlike humans, equine choke does not prevent the animal from breathing, but is still a very serious problem that can eventually lead to [[pneumonia]] if left untreated.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===The stomach===
Horses have a relatively small [[stomach]] for their size that limits the amount of feed a horse can take in at one time.  The average sized horse (800 to 1200 lbs) has a stomach with a capacity of only 2 to 4 gallons,<ref name="Rutgers"/> and works best when it is about 2/3 full.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Therefore, best management allows horses to have continuous access to forage or at least several small meals, as opposed to one or two large meals a day.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Food arrives into the stomach from the esophagus. The majority of [[gastric juice]] is made up of [[hydrochloric acid]], which turns [[pepsinogen]] into the enzyme [[pepsin]]. Pepsin allows for the partial breakdown of proteins. Other enzymes include [[resin (enzyme)|resin]] and [[lipase]]. Additionally, the stomach absorbs some water, as well as ions and lipid soluble compounds. The main purpose of the stomach, however, is to break down food into [[chyme]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} It then leaves the stomach through the [[pyloric valve]], which controls the flow of food out of stomach.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===The small intestine===
The horse’s [[small intestine]] is 50 to 70 feet long and holds 10 to 23 gallons. This is the major digestive organ, and where most nutrients are absorbed.<ref name="Rutgers"/><ref name="Digestive system">[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_5.html "Horse Nutrition - The Horse's Digestive System." Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.]  Web site accessed February 9, 2007.</ref>

Additionally, the pancreas and liver both play a role in the small intestine, by secreting a very alkaline digestive juice about 5-6 inches from the [[pyloric valve]]. This counteracts the acidity of the chyme arriving from the stomach and prevents it from eating through the tissue of the intestine.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===The cecum and large intestine===
Most liquids are passed to the [[cecum]], also known as the "water gut" or "hind gut." It is a cul-de-sac pouch,<ref name="Digestive system"/> about 3 to 4 feet long that holds 7 to 8 gallons. It contains [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] that digest plant [[fiber]] (through [[fermentation]]) and any soluble carbohydrates.<ref name="Rutgers"/>  Horses must have their diets changed slowly so that the bacteria in the cecum are able to modify and adapt to the different chemical structure of new feedstuffs.<ref name="Digestive system"/> Too abrupt a change in diet can cause colic, as the new food is not properly digested.

The large [[colon]], small colon, and [[rectum]] make up the [[large intestine]]. The large colon is about 12 feet long and holds up to 20 gallons. Its main purpose it to absorb carbohydrates which were broken down from cellulose in the cecum. Due to its many twists and turns, it is a common place for a type of [[horse colic]] called an impaction.<ref name="Rutgers"/><ref name="Digestive system"/>

The small colon leads is 10-12 feet in length and holds only 5 gallons of material. It is the area where the majority of water in the horse's diet is absorbed, and is also the place where [[fecal]] balls are formed.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The [[rectum]] is about one foot long, and acts as a holding chamber for fecal matter, which is passed out the [[anus]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Nutrients==
Equines require six main classes of nutrients to survive: [[water]], [[fats]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[minerals]].<ref name="Rutgers"/>

===Water===
Water is necessary for life.  Horses can only live about 72 hours without [[water]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  Therefore, it is critically important that horses have access to a fresh, clean, and adequate supply of water. 

An average horse drinks 10 to 12 gallons of water per day, more in hot weather or when eating dry forage such as [[hay]], less in cool weather or when on lush [[pasture]]. When under hard work, or for the [[lactating]] [[mare (horse)|mare]], water requirements may be up to four times greater than normal.<ref name="Rutgers"/><ref name="water">[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_6.html "Horse Nutrition - Diet Factors - Water." Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.]  Web site accessed February 9, 2007.</ref> 

Water plays an important part in digestion. The forages and grains horses eat are mixed with saliva in the mouth to make a moist bolus that can be easily swallowed.  Therefore, horses produce up to 10 gallons (85 lb.) of [[saliva]] per day.<ref name="Digestive system"/>  

===Energy nutrients and protein===
Nutritional sources of energy for horses are [[fat]] and [[carbohydrate]]s.<ref name="Carbohydrates"/>  [[Protein]] is a critical building block for muscles and other tissues.<ref name="Protein">[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_8.html "Horse Nutrition - Protein." Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.]  Web site accessed February 9, 2007.</ref> Horses that are heavily exercised, growing, [[pregnant]] or [[lactating]] need increased energy and protein in their diet.<ref name="Rutgers"/> However, if a horse has too much energy in its diet and not enough exercise, it can become too high-spirited and difficult to handle.<ref name="Myths">[http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/hrs3243 Warren, Lori K.  "Horse Feeding Myths and Misconceptions" Horse Industry Section, Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development] Web site accessed February 16, 2007</ref>
 
[[Fat]] exists in low levels in plants and can be added to a feed to increase the energy density of the diet. Fat has 9 Mcal/kg of energy,<ref name="Rutgers"/> which is 2.25 times that of any carbohydrate source.<ref name="fat">[http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/resources/livestock/horses/ag558-7.html Mowrey, Robert A. "Horse Feeding Management - High-Fat Diets for Horses". ''from'' North Carolina Cooperative Extension Center], web site accessed February 14, 2007</ref> Unlike humans, horses do not have a [[gall bladder]].<ref name="Rutgers"/> Therefore [[bile]] flows continuously from the [[liver]] directly into the stomach.<ref>[http://www.cvm.okstate.edu/instruction/mm_curr/histology/HistologyReference/HRD2.htm "Digestive System 2"], web site accessed February 14, 2007</ref> Thus [[fat]], though a necessary [[nutrient]], is difficult for horses to digest and utilize in large quantities, though they are able digest a greater amount than can [[cattle]].<ref name="Myths"/>  Horses benefit from up to 8% fat in their diets, but more does not always provide a visible benefit.  Horses can only have 15%-20% fat in their diet without ill effects.  Above this amount, horses may develop [[diarrhea]].<ref name="fat"/>

[[Carbohydrates]] are usually fed in the form of [[hay]], [[grass]] and [[grain]].  They are the main energy source in most feeds. [[Soluble]] carbohydrates such as [[starch]]es and [[sugar]]s are readily broken down to [[glucose]] in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not  digested by enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large intestine to break down and release their energy sources, the volatile [[fatty acid]]s.<ref name="Rutgers"/>

Soluble carbohydrates are found in nearly every feed source; [[corn]] has the highest amount, then [[barley]] and [[oats]]. [[Forage]]s normally have only 6 to 8% soluble carbohydrate, but under certain conditions can have up to 30%. Sudden ingestion of large amounts of starch or high sugar feeds can cause colic or [[laminitis]].<ref name="Carbohydrates"/> 
 
[[Protein]] is used by all body cells, especially muscle, enzymes, blood, hormones, hooves, and hair cells.<ref name="Horse sense">[http://www.admani.com/allianceequine/TechBulletins/Applying%20Horse%20Sense%20To%20Horse%20Nutrition.htm  "Applying Horse Sense to Horse Nutrition"  Alliance Nutrition Equine.] Web site accessed February 14, 2007</ref>  The main building blocks of protein are [[amino acid]]s. [[Alfalfa]] and other [[legumes]] in [[hay]] are good sources of protein that can be easily added to the diet.  Most adult horses only require 8 to 10% protein in their diet; however, higher protein is important for lactating mares and young growing [[foal]]s.<ref name="Protein"/>

===Vitamins and minerals===
Horses that are not subjected to hard work or extreme conditions usually have more than adequate amounts of vitamins in their diet if they are receiving fresh green forage and/or premixed rations.  Horses sometimes need a vitamin supplement when feeding low-quality hay, if a horse is under stress (traveling, showing, racing, etc.), or not eating well due to illness.  Most of the vitamins used by horses are found in green, leafy forages, so a very high-grain diet also requires specialized supplementation to prevent an imbalance of vitamins and minerals.<ref name="Rutgers"/>

Minerals are required for maintenance of  the skeleton, nerves and muscles. Minerals needed by horses include [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[chloride]], and are commonly found in most good-quality feeds.  Horses also need trace minerals such as [[magnesium]], [[selenium]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] and [[iodine]]. Normally, if adult horses at maintenance levels are consuming fresh hay or on pasture, they will receive adequate amounts of minerals in their diet, with the exception of sodium chloride ([[salt]]), which must be provided, preferably free choice.<ref name="minerals">[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_9.html  "Horse Nutrition - Minerals." Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.]  Web site accessed February 14, 2007.</ref> 

Calcium and phosphorus are needed in a specific ratio of between 1:1 and 2:1.  Adult horses can tolerate up to a 5:1 ratio, foals no more than 3:1.  Horses never should have a greater ratio of phosphorus than calcium. <ref name="minerals"/>

[[Foal]]s and young growing horses through their first three to four years have special nutritional needs and require feeds that are balanced with a proper Calcium:Phosphorus ratio and other trace minerals.   A number of [[skeleton|skeletal]] problems may occur in young horses with an unbalanced diet.<ref name="minerals"/> Working horses also have increased needs; plus, sweating depletes sodium, potassium, and chloride from the horse’s system, therefore, supplementation with [[electrolyte]]s may be required for horses in intense training, especially in hot weather.<ref name="Rutgers"/> 
 
==Types of feed==
[[Image:GrassHay1.jpg|thumb|Good quality grass hay is green and has visible leaves and young seed heads.]] Horses and other equids can consume approximately 2% to 2.5% of their body weight in dry feed each day. Therefore, a 1000 lb adult horse could eat up to 25 pounds of food.<ref name="Penn">[http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/FreePubs/pdfs/uc099.pdf Hall, Marvin H. and Particia M. Comerford. "Pasture and Hay for Horses - Argonomy facts 32," 1992 University of Pennsylvania, Cooperative Extension Service.]  Web site accessed Feberary 14, 2007.</ref> [[Foal]]s less than six months of age eat 2 to 4% of their weight each day.<ref name="Feeding factors">[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_12.html "Horse Nutrition - Feeding factors." Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.] Web site accessed February 9, 2007.</ref>  

Solid feeds eaten by horses are placed into three categories:  forages (hay, grass, etc.), concentrates (grain, etc.) and supplements (such as prepared vitamin or mineral pellets).  Equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal's diet by weight should be [[forage]]s.<ref name="Feeding factors"/>  If a horse is working hard and requires more energy, the use of [[grain]] is increased and the percentage of forage decreased so that the horse obtains the nutrient balance it needs for the work it is performing.  However, forage amount should never go below 1% of the horse's body weight per day.<ref name="Penn"/>

===Forages===
Forages, also known as "roughage," are plant materials classified as [[legume]]s or [[grass]]es, found in [[pasture]]s or in [[hay]]. Often, pastures and hayfields will contain a bland of both grasses and legumes. Nutrients available in forage vary greatly with maturity of the grasses, fertilization, management, and environmental conditions.<ref name="Penn"/> 

Grasses are tolerant of a wide range of conditions and contain most necessary nutrients.  Some commonly used grasses include orchard grass, brome, timothy, bluegrass, and fescue.  Grasses alone are quite adequate nutritionally for mature horses who are not subjected to intense work.<ref name="Carbohydrates"/>

Legumes such as [[clover]] or [[alfalfa]] are usually higher in [[protein]], [[calcium]], and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil to produce the best nutrients. Legume hays are generally higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium-phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.<ref name="Carbohydrates"/>

[[Hay]] is a dried mixture of [[grass]]es and [[legume]]s. It cut in the field and then dried and baled for storage.<ref name="Penn"/>  Hay is most nutritious when it is cut early on, before the seed heads are fully mature and before the stems of the plants become tough and thick.  Hay that is very green can be a good indicator of the amount of nutrients in the hay, however, color should not be used as sole indicator, smell and texture are also important.<ref>[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_21.html "Horse Nutrition - Hay quality." Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.] Web site accessed February 9, 2007</ref> Hay can be analyzed by many laboratories and that is the most reliable way to tell the nutritional values it contains.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Moldy or dusty hay should not be fed to horses.<ref name="Rutgers"/>

Another type of forage sometimes provided to horses is [[beet pulp]], a byproduct left over from the processing of [[sugar beet]]s, which is high in energy as well as fiber.<ref name="Myths"/>

Occasionally, horses may be fed [[straw]].  However, this is roughage with little nutritional value. It is not recommended by nutritionists as a horse feed, though is sometimes used as a filler in areas where hay is difficult to obtain and the horse must meet most nutritional needs via concentrated feeds, but still needs roughage for proper digestive health.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  It is usually used as a bedding in stalls to absorb wastes.  

===Concentrates===
[[Image:Haverkorrels Avena sativa.jpg|thumb|Oats]]
====Grains====
[[Oat]]s are the most popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower digestible energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the horse's digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible for horses than other grains.<ref name="Horse sense"/><ref name="Carbohydrates"/>

[[Corn]] is the second most palatable grain for horses. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn should never be fed because it is lethal to horses.<ref name="Rutgers"/> 

[[Barley]] is also fed to horses, but needs to be  processed to crack the seed hull and allow easier digestibility.  [[Wheat]] is generally not used as a concentrate.  However, [[wheat bran]] is also sometimes added to the diet of a horse for supplemental nutrition.<ref name="Carbohydrates"/>

Many feed manufacturers combine various grains and add additional vitamin and mineral supplements to create a complete premixed feed that is easy for owners to feed and of predictable nutritional quality.<ref name="Horse sense"/>  Some of these prepared feeds are manufactured in pelleted form, others retain the grains in their original form.<ref>[http://horse.purinamills.com/products/complete_list.asp Purina list of horse feeds]</ref><ref>[http://www.nutrenaworld.com/Products/default.aspx Nutrena Product lines]</ref> In many cases [[molasses]] as a binder to keep down dust and for increased palatability.<ref name="Carbohydrates"/>

====Supplements====
 
Extra fat and protein are sometimes added to the horse's diet, along with vitamin and mineral supplements.<ref name="fat"/> The average modern horse on good hay or pasture with light work usually does not need feed supplements; however, horses subjected to stress due to age, intensive athletic work, or reproduction may need additional nutrition.<ref name="Penn"/>

[[Soybean]] meal is a common protein supplement, and averages about 44% crude protein. The protein in soybean meal is usually a high-quality protein with the proper ratio of dietary essential [[amino acid]]s for equids.  [[Cottonseed]] meal, [[Linseed]] meal, and peanut meal are also used, but are not as common.<ref name="Protein"/>

Brewer’s grains are the mash removed from [[malt]] when making [[beer]].  Horses like the taste, it is about 25% crude protein, high in fat (13%) and contains B vitamins.<ref name="Rutgers"/>

[[Vegetable oil]] is a commonly used fat source in horse feeds.  [[Corn oil]] is particularly popular, but other oils are used as well.<ref name="fat"/> [[Rice bran]] is another fat supplement on the market. There are several commercial products available through feed dealers.<ref name="Rutgers"/> Ground [[flax]] seed is another good source of fat, though it must ground up for horses to digest it.<ref>[http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-health/horse-weight-feed-26310.aspx  Christie, Sarah. "Horse Nutrition -  Balancing Your Horse's Diet to Achieve an Ideal Weight." ''Horse Illustrated'', May 3006]</ref>  Some commercial feed manufacturers now make products containing both flaxseed and rice bran.<ref>[http://www.nutrenaworld.com/Products/default.aspx Nutrena Product lines - Nutrena Empower]</ref>

There are hundreds, if not thousands of commercially prepared vitamin and mineral supplements on the market, many tailored to horses with specialized needs.<ref>[http://www.smartpakequine.com/BrowseSupplements.aspx  SmartPak Equine supplement categories]</ref>

==How to feed==
Most horses only need quality forage, water and a salt or mineral block.<ref name="Rutgers"/> Grain or other concentrates are often not necessary.<ref name="March"/>  But, when grain or other concentrates are fed, quantities must be carefully monitored. To do so, horse feed is measured by weight, not volume.  For example, 1 lb. of Oats has a different volume than 1 lb. of Corn.<ref name="Rutgers"/> When feed has to be restricted, it is more consistent with the horse's natural feeding behavior to provide three small feedings instead of one or two large ones.  However, even two feedings a day is preferable to only one.<ref name="Nevada"/> 

===Feeding forages===
Horses always require forage.  When possible, nutritionists recommend forage be available at all times, at least when doing so does not overfeed the horse and lead to [[obesity]].  Horses can safely eat a ration that is 100% forage,<ref name="March"/> (along with water and supplemental salt) and any feed ration should be at least 50% forage.<ref name="Feeding factors"/> Hay with alfalfa or other legumes has more concentrated nutrition and so is fed in smaller amounts than grass hay, though many hays have a mixture of both types of plant.  

When [[beet pulp]] is fed, a ration of 2 to 5 pounds is usually soaked in water for 3 to 4 hours prior to feeding in order to make it more palatable, and to minimize the risk of choke and other problems.  Beet pulp is usually fed in addition to hay, but occasionally is a replacement for hay when fed to very old horses who can no longer chew properly.<ref name="Myths"/>

===Feeding concentrates===
Concentrates, when fed, are recommended to be provided in quantities no greater than 1% of a horse's body weight per day,<ref name="Penn"/> and ideally no more than 0.5% per feeding.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  If a ration needs to contain a higher percent of concentrates, such as that of a [[horse racing|race horse]], bulky grains such as oats should be used as much as possible; a loose mass of high fiber food helps prevent colic.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

In general, the portion of the ration that should be grain or other concentrated feed is 0 to 10% grain for mature idle horses, and 20 to 70% for horses at work, depending on age, intensity of activity and energy requirements.<ref name="Feeding factors"/> 

Concentrates should not be fed to horses within one hour before or after a heavy workout.<ref name="March"/> Concentrates also need to be cut back (as much as 50%) on days that a horse is not worked.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Not only can excess grain and inadequate exercise lead to behavior problems,<ref name="Myths"/> it may also trigger [[Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis]], or "tying up," in horses prone to the condition.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Access to water===
Horses normally require free access to all the fresh, clean [[water]] they want.  However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources. But, a hot horse that has ceased work needs to be cooled out and walked for 30—90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so horses '''do''' need to be offered some water during the cooling off process.  A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked.  Sometimes the horse's thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.<ref name="water"/><ref name="Myths"/>

===Feed storage===
All feed must kept dry and free of mold, [[rodent]] feces and other types of contamination that may cause illness in horses.<ref name="March"/> Never give a horse feed contaminated by the remains of a dead animal, it is a potential source of [[botulism]].<ref>[http://www.ces.uga.edu/Agriculture/asdsvm/LVSeptOct2001.pdf  Heusner, Gary. "Horse Feed Quality and Contamination."] Web site accessed February 16, 2007.</ref> For example, [[mouse|mice]] can get into poorly stored grain, and hay bales sometimes accidentally contain [[snake]]s, mice, or other small animals that were caught in the baling machinery in the harvesting process.

===Feeding behavior===
Horses were designed to eat small amounts often. They also do best when they are fed on a regular schedule, they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine.<ref name="Rutgers"/>  When horses are in a herd, their [[horse behavior|behavior]] is hierarchical;<ref>[http://www.esc.rutgers.edu/publications/general/fs525.htm Williams, Carey A.Ph.D., Extension Specialist. "The Basics of Equine Behavior," FS #525 ''from''  Equine Science Center, Rutgers University, 2004.]  Web site accessed February 14, 2007</ref>  the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first, and sometimes low-status animals may not get to eat enough food, or any at all.  Unless a herd is on pasture that meets all their nutritional needs, it is important to either feed horses separately or spread their feed out in separate feeders to be sure all animals get enough to eat.<!--widely known info, need to find source-->

===Treats===
Many people like to feed horses special treats such as [[carrot]]s, sugar cubes, peppermint candies or specially manufactured horse "cookies."  Horses do not need treats, and due to the risk of colic or choke, many horse owners do not allow their horses to be given treats, especially by other people.  However, carrots and compressed hay pellets are common nutritious treats and generally not harmful.  Horse "cookies" are often specially manufactured with ordinary concentrates and some added molasses and generally will not cause any nutritional problems when fed in small quantities.  There are also behavioral issues that some horses may develop if given too many treats, particularly a tendency to bite if hand-fed, and for this reason many horse trainers and riding instructors discourage the practice.<ref> "The Debate Over Treats." ''Equus'' no. 345, June 2006, p. 42</ref> In addition, any type of human food is potentially dangerous to a horse and should not be fed.  This includes bread products, meat products, candy, and carbonated beverages.  

It was also once a common practice to give horses a weekly ''bran mash'' of wheat bran mixed with warm water and other ingredients.  It is still done regularly in some places.  While a warm soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy, and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect, it is not nutritionally necessary.  An old horse with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water, a mash may help provide extra hydration, and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather, but horses have far more fiber in their regular diet than do humans, and so any laxative effect is unneeded. There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a once-weekly feed of unusual contents could trigger a bout of colic.<ref name="Myths"/> 

==Dental issues==
Horses' [[horse teeth|teeth]] continually grow throughout their life, are worn down as they eat, and can develop uneven wear patterns that can interfere with chewing.  For this reason, all horses' teeth need to be examined at least once a year, and particular care must be paid to the dental needs of older horses.<ref>[http://www.admani.com/allianceequine/TechBulletins/The%20Old%20Horse%20Dilemma.htm  Reynolds, Judith A, Ph.D., P.A.S. "The 'Old Horse' Dilemma," ADM Alliance Nutrition.] Web site accessed February 14, 2007</ref> The process of grinding off uneven wear patterns on a horse's teeth is called ''floating'' and can be performed by a [[veterinarian]] or a specialist in equine dentistry.

==Illnesses related to improper feeding==
{{Main|Horse colic|Laminitis|Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis}}
[[Horse colic]] can occur due to any number of digestive upsets, from mild bloating due to excess intestinal gas to life-threatening impactions.  Colic is most often caused by a change in diet, either a planned change that takes place too quickly, or an accidental change, such as a horse getting out of its barn or paddock and ingesting unfamiliar plants. But colic has many other possible triggers including an irregular feeding schedule, stress and illness.  Because the horse cannot vomit and has a limited capacity to detoxify harmful substances, anything upsetting to the horse must travel all the way through the digestive system to be expelled.  

Choke is less common than colic, but can occur, particularly if a horse "bolts" its food, that is, eats too rapidly, particularly when there has been insufficient access to water.  It is exceedingly difficult for a horse to expel anything from the esophagus, and so immediate treatment is often required. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Horses are also susceptible to [[laminitis]], an inflammation of the lamina of the [[horse hoof|hoof]].  Laminitis has many causes, but the most common is related to a sugar and starch overload from a horse overeating certain types of food, particularly too much [[pasture]] grass high in [[fructan]] in early spring and late fall, or by getting into excessive quantities of grain.<ref>[http://www.safergrass.org/ Safergrass.org web site, accessed February 26, 2007]</ref>

Colic and laminitis can be life-threatening conditions when a horse is severely affected, and [[veterinarian|veterinary]] care is necessary to properly treat both conditions.<ref>[http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/AS/AS_555_W.pdf Brady.

Young horses that are overfed or are fed a diet with an improper calcium:phosphorus ratio over time may develop a number of growth and metabolic disorders, some permanent.  Adult horses with an unbalanced diet may also develop metabolic problems.  However, these conditions develop slowly, and if caught in time can often be helped by corrected feeding practices.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis]], or "tying up," is a condition to which only some horses are susceptible, but for those that are, a day of rest on full grain ration may often lead to severe muscular cramping when work is resumed, a set of symptoms that led to the [[archaic]] nickname for the condition, "Monday morning sickness."  Cutting back or eliminating concentrates for a horse on days it is not worked appears to minimize the risk of an ER attack.
