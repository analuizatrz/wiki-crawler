'''Princess Viktoria of Baden''' (Sophie Marie Viktoria) ([[August 7]], [[1862]] – [[April 4]], [[1930]]), later '''Queen Victoria of Sweden''', was a member of the [[Zähringen|Badish Grand Ducal Family]], who became the [[Queen Consort]] of [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustav V of Sweden]].

==Birth==
Princess Viktoria was born on [[August 7]], [[1862]] at the castle in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]]. Her father was [[Friedrich I, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden]], the fourth child of [[Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke Leopold I of Baden]] and [[Sophie of Sweden|Grand Duchess Sophie of Baden (''née'' Princess Sofia of Sweden)]]. Her mother was [[Princess Louise of Prussia|Princess Luise of Baden (''née'' Princess Luise of Prussia)]], the second child of [[William I, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany]] and [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar|Empress Augusta of Germany (''née'' Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar)]]. Victoria was also great-granddaughter (by her paternal grandmother) of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] and [[Frederica of Baden|Queen Fredrika of Sweden (''née'' Princess Frederika of Baden)]].

==Marriage==
Princess Viktoria married on [[September 20]], [[1881]] [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and Norway]], the son of [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway]] and [[Sofia of Nassau|Queen Sofia of Sweden and Norway (''née'' Princess Sophia of Nassau)]]. Princess Viktoria then became Princess Victoria.

==Children==
Together, Princess Victoria and Prince Gustaf had three children:
#'''[[Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden|King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]]''' ([[November 11]], [[1882]] – [[September 15]], [[1973]]).
#'''[[Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland|Prince Vilhelm of Sweden, Duke of Södermanland]]''' ([[June 17]], [[1884]] – [[June 5]], [[1965]]).
#'''[[Prince Erik, Duke of Västmanland|Prince Erik of Sweden, Duke of Västmanland]]''' ([[April 20]], [[1889]] – [[September 20]], [[1918]]).

==Life as a Queen==
She became Queen of Sweden at her father-in-law's death on [[September 8]], [[1907]]. Gustaf became the new King as ''Gustaf V''. Princess Victoria then became Queen Victoria.

Queen Victoria had substantial political influence over her husband, who was often considered Pro-German. She and her husband were brought together by their royal families, and their marriage are reported not to have been such a happy one (although is said to have been improved towards the end of their lives). They both had affairs outside of the marriage, but the marriage produced three children.
 
Queen Victoria suffered from a very poor health (much due to mistreatment from several doctors in her youth), and she often went abroad on trips to make her health better (she suffered from [[bronchitis]] and possibly [[tuberculosis]]). As Crown Princess these trips were very common, but became much less so once she became Queen Consort.

From [[1892]] until her death, [[Axel Munthe]] was her personal physician and recommended for health reasons that she spend winters on the Italian island of [[Capri]]. While initially hesitant, in the autumn of [[1910]] she traveled to Capri, arriving to an official welcome and a crowd which escorted her from the Marina Grand to the Hotel Paradise. From then on, except during [[World War I|the first world war]] and for the last two years of her life, she spent several months a year on Capri. After some time, she decided to purchase her own residence on Capri, an intimate rustic two-story farmhouse she named [[Casa Caprile]], which she had extensively landscaped, surrounding it with a dense park. In the 1950s, some years after her death, this property became a hotel.

The Queen went to Munthe's residence, the [[Villa San Michele]], most mornings in order to join Munthe for walks around the island. Munthe and the Queen also arranged evening concerts at San Michele, at which the Queen played piano. They also shared a love of animals, with the Queen frequently being seen with a leashed dog, and she was known to support Munthe's (eventually successful) efforts to purchase [[Mount Barbarossa]] for use as a bird sanctuary. Perhaps inevitably given the small local population and their close friendship, it was rumored that Munthe and the Queen were lovers, but this has not been substantiated.

Although Queen Victoria lost a lot of popularity among the [[Swedes]] for her often notable Pro-German attitude (particularly politically during [[World War I]] when she is said to have influenced her husband to large extents) she was respected and admired for her strong female personality. She has also by Swedish historians in later years been somewhat revalued considering her horrendously strict [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] upbring and constant painful health problems that haunted her all her life (during her difficult pregnancies for example, she was treated with mercury/quicksilver and undue heavy medications - people think that this is the reason for her main health problems). She is regarded as probably the most talented of the Swedish queens ever: she was an incredibly accomplished amateure [[photographer]] and [[painter]]. On her travels in [[Egypt]] and [[Italy]] she both photographed and painted extensively, and experimented with all kinds of photo developing techniques, producing very high quality photographic work. She was also an excellent [[pianist]] and, for example, could play through the complete ''[[Ring of the Nibelung]]'' by [[Wagner]] without notes (she had had a phenomenal music education and in her youth she had turned the notes on court concerts for [[Franz Liszt]]). Her favourite composers were [[Schubert]] and [[Beethoven]].

She was also devoted to various kinds of charity, both in [[Sweden]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. 

==Death==
Towards the end of her life, with her health declining, Munthe recommended she no longer spend time in Capri, and she returned to Sweden for some time, building a Capri-styled villa there. She then moved to Rome.

Her final visit to Sweden was on her husband's 70th birthday in [[1928]], and 
Queen Victoria died on [[April 4]], [[1930]] in her home Villa Svezia in [[Rome]] at age 67.
