'''Ladislav Pataki''' ([[June 20]], [[1946]]–[[April 5]], [[2007]]) was an [[United States|American]] coach, [[sports scientist]], and masters track and field thrower.  He defected from [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1985 with his wife and daughter, settling in [[Los Gatos, California]].  He influenced the training of several world-class athletes living in the [[SFBA#South Bay|South Bay Area]], where he continued his sports science career and developed nutritional supplements.  As a [[masters (athletics)|masters]] competitor in track and field, he won several world championships and set world records in shot put and discus.<ref>[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_states_olympic_committee/index.html?query=PATAKI,%20LADISLAV&field=per&match=exact Robert McG. Thomas Jr., ''New York Times,'' "SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Imagery in Motion:] When Ladislav Pataki sneaked out of a Rome hotel with his wife and daughter last July and sought asylum at the United States Embassy, the move boded well for American athletics. Pataki, a former discus and hammer-throw coach who, as a biomechanical specialist, had been coordinator of a Czechoslovak training-research project, was the highest-ranking Soviet-bloc sports scientist ever to defect to the West."

He had surgery for brain cancer in the Czech Republic in 2006, after declining chemotherapy.  When the tumor could not be completely removed, he entered an assisted living residence in [[San Jose, California]].<ref>[http://www.mercurynews.com/search/ci_5216700 Elliott Almond, ''San Jose Mercury News,'' "Ladislav Pataki has brain cancer: A Valley Fixture Since Defection," [[February 13]], [[2007]]], accessed April 11]], [[2007]]</ref>  He died at age 60.  

== Early life and education ==
Pataki grew up in [[Nové Zámky]], in the former [[Soviet-bloc]] state of Czechoslovakia.<ref>[http://www.mercurynews.com/search/ci_5635404 Elliott Almond, ''San Jose Mercury News,'' "Renowned throwing specialist Pataki to be memorialized," [[April 10]], [[2007]]], accessed [[April 11]], [[2007]]</ref> Nové Zámky is located in the [[Nitra Region]] in the southwest of modern [[Slovakia]]. According to his resumes, Pataki was the 1964 Czechoslovak Junior Champion and record holder in shot put.  After competing in sports internationally as a youth, he earned two [[Doctorate]] of Research degrees from [[Comenius University in Bratislava|Bratislava Komenski University]], with a 1971 thesis in [[kinesiology]] and a 1977 thesis in [[sport science]].<ref>[http://www.powerlean.com/Brochures/DrPataki.html "Who is Ladislav Pataki?"] (resume with links to a longer autobiography), accessed [[April 12]], [[2007]]</ref>

After completing his first doctorate, he started his career in 1972 as head coach for discus throwing of the Czechoslovak National Team.

In the U.S., Pataki continued his sports science career, influencing the training of a group of world-class throwers in the South Bay who were competing in [[shot put]], [[discus throw|discus]], and [[hammer throw]].  The concentration of strength-event athletes became known as "Weight City."  (Nearby [[San Jose State University]] had been nicknamed Speed City during its period of track and field success in the 1960s.)<ref>[http://www.speedcityera.com/index.html The Speed City Era], accessed [[April 12]], [[2007]]</ref> He also began a business career developing and marketing nutritional supplements.

In 2006, Pataki helped develop a [[nanotechnology]]-based skin care product at AmerElite Solutions, where he was the director of research and development.<ref>[http://losgatosobserver.com/los-gatos/Article.php?article_id=0273 Alastair Dallas, ''Los Gatos Observer,'' "Ladislav Pataki (1946-2007): Cold War defector came to Los Gatos," [[April 11]], [[2007]]], accessed [[April 11]], [[2007]]</ref>
