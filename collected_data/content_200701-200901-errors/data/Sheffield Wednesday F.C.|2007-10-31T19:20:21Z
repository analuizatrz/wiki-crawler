'''Sheffield Wednesday Football Club''' is a professional [[football (soccer)|football]] team based in [[Sheffield]], [[England]] who currently compete in the [[Football League]] of [[England]] in [[Football League Championship|The Championship division]]. Wednesday are one of the oldest professional clubs in the world. 

The Owls have won four [[English football champions|league titles]], three [[FA Cup]]s and one [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], but their League Cup triumph in [[1991 in football (soccer)|1991]] is their only major trophy since [[World War II]]. They did reach both domestic cup finals in [[1993 in football (soccer)|1993]], but lost 2-1 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] each time.

<!-- This section is meant to be just a summary. Please do not add too much detail - the [[History of Sheffield Wednesday F.C.]] article is intended for detailed additions. -->

===Early years===
[[Image:Leaflet advert for blackburn rovers match-1887.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leaflet advertising the opening match at Olive Grove between The Wednesday and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[12 September]] [[1887]]]]

The club was a [[cricket]] team when it formed in [[1820s in sports|1820]] as ''The Wednesday Cricket Club''. A meeting on the evening of Wednesday [[4 September]] [[1867]] at the [[Adelphi Hotel]] established a footballing side to keep the team together and fit during the winter months. They played their first match against the Mechanics on [[19 October]] the same year.<ref name="Sheffield Football">{{cite book|first=Keith|last=Farnsworth|title=Sheffield Football A History:Volume 1 1857–1861|publisher=Hallamshire Press|date=1995|id=ISBN 1-874718-13-X}}</ref>

It soon became apparent that football would come to eclipse the cricketing side of the club. On [[1 February]] [[1868]], Wednesday played their first competitive football match as they entered the [[Cromwell Cup]], a four-team competition for newly formed clubs. They went on to win the cup, beating the Garrick Club 1-0 after extra time in the final at [[Bramall Lane]].<ref name="Cromwell Cup">{{cite web|title=The Cromwell Cup|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~a.drake/sheff/cup/cromwell.htm|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>

[[Charles Clegg (footballer)|Charles Clegg]] joined Wednesday in the 1870s, starting a relationship that would last the rest of his life and eventually lead to his becoming the club's chairman. He also became president and chairman of the [[The Football Association|Football Association]] and known as the "Napoleon of Football".<ref name="Statto">{{cite web|title=Players, Managers and Administrators|publisher=FL Interactive Limited |url=http://www.swfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/StattoDetail/0,,10304~390120,00.html|accessdate=2006-08-17}}</ref> In [[1876 in football (soccer)|1876]] they acquired Scot [[James Lang (footballer)|James Lang]]. Although he was not employed by the club, he was given a job by a member of the Sheffield Wednesday board that had no formal duties. He is now acknowledged as the first professional football player in England.<ref name="In the Beginning">{{cite web|title=In the Beginning|publisher=FL Interactive Limited|url=http://www.swfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0,,10304~65717,00.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>

The 1880s saw two major events that radically changed the face of the club. In [[1882 in football (soccer)|1882]] the cricket and football clubs parted ways;<ref name="Wednesday!">{{cite book|last=Farnsworth|first=Keith| title=Wednesday!|publisher=Sheffield City Libraries|date=1982}}</ref> the cricket club would later go out of existence in 1925. The football club turned professional in [[1887 in football (soccer)|1887]] after pressure from players threatening to defect to other clubs. Sheffield Wednesday won their first game as a professional club against the Mechanics by 3 goals to nil.

===Professional football===
The move to professionalism took the team from [[Bramall Lane]], which had taken a share of the ticket revenue, to the new [[Olive Grove]]. In [[1889 in football (soccer)|1889]] the club became founder members of the [[Football Alliance]], of which they were the first champions in a season where they also reached the [[1890 in football (soccer)|1890]] [[FA Cup]] Final, losing 6-1 to [[Blackburn Rovers]] at the [[Kennington Oval]]. Despite finishing the following season bottom of the Alliance, they were eventually elected to the expanded [[Football League]] in [[1892 in football (soccer)|1892]]. They won the FA Cup for the first time in [[1896 in football (soccer)|1896]], beating [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] 2-1 at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]].

Due to an expansion of the local railway lines, the club were told that they would have to find a new ground for the [[1899-1900 in English football|1899–1900 season]]. After a difficult search the club finally bought some land in the village of Owlerton, which at the time was several miles outside the city boundaries. Construction of a new stadium (now known as [[Hillsborough Stadium]]) was completed within months and the club was secured for the next century. In a strong decade Wednesday won the league twice in the [[1902-03 in English football|1902–03]] and [[1903-04 in English football|1903–04]] seasons and the FA Cup again in [[1907 in football (soccer)|1907]], beating [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], again at Crystal Palace by 2 goals to 1. After this the club went through a relatively fallow period for another two decades.

The team were almost relegated in the [[1928-29 in English football|1928–29]] season, but with 17 points in the last 10 matches they pulled off a great escape, rising from bottom to 14th. Wednesday went on to win the league title the following season ([[1929-30 in English football|1929–30]]), which started a run that would see the team finishing lower than third only once until 1936. The period was topped off with the team winning the FA Cup for the third time in the club's history in [[1935 in football (soccer)|1935]].

===Post-war turmoil===
The 1950s saw Wednesday unable to consistently hold on to a position in the top flight. After being promoted back up in [[1950 in football (soccer)|1950]], they were relegated three times, although each time they bounced back up by winning the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] the following season. The decade ended on a high note with the team finally finishing in the top half of the First Division for the first time since [[World War II]].

This led to a decade of successfully remaining in the First Division, which included a run to the FA Cup Final in [[1966 in football (soccer)|1966]] – notable in that Wednesday played all their ties away from home. Off the field the club was embroiled in the [[British betting scandal of 1964]] where three of their players, [[Peter Swan]], [[David Layne]] and [[Tony Kay]], were accused of [[match fixing]] and [[sports betting|betting]] against their own team in an away game at Ipswich Town. The three were subsequently convicted and, on release from prison, banned from football for life.<ref name="Betting Scandal">{{cite web|title = The 1960s - The Kay, Swan and Layne affair| url=http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/TimeMachineDetail/0,,10301~791880,00.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> The three were reprieved in the early 1970s with Swan and Layne returning to Hillsborough and though their careers were virtually over Swan at least played some league games for the Owls.

Wednesday were relegated at the end of the [[1969-70 in English football|1969–70 season]], starting the darkest period in the club's history. After going into free-fall they dropped to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time in their history and were marooned there for five seasons. The club were almost relegated to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in [[1976 in football (soccer)|1976]], but a revival under the management of [[Jack Charlton]], and the aid of Coach [[Tony Toms]] saw them return to the First Division in [[1984 in football (soccer)|1984]].

===Modern highs and lows===
Sheffield Wednesday spent the majority of the 1980s and 1990s in the top tier of English football. [[1990-91 in English football|1990–91]] was the only season out of sixteen in a row that Wednesday spent in a lower division, but the season is best remembered by fans for Wednesday's swift return to the top flight under the management of Ron Atkinson and their [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] to win their first major trophy for over 50 years. The [[1992-93 in English football|1992–93]] season established Sheffield Wednesday as a top club as they visited [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley]] four times during the season - a League Cup final and an FA Cup semi-final, final and replay. In the FA Cup Semi-Finals they recorded a historic win over the city rivals Sheffield United, 2-1. However Wednesday failed to win any silverware, losing to Arsenal in both League and FA Cup finals, the latter after [[Andy Linighan]]'s late extra-time winner in the replay to give Arsenal the victory.

[[Image:Playoffs 021.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Wednesday lift the 2005 League One Playoff Trophy]]

Wednesday's fortunes took a turn for the worse when a succession of managers failed to maintain this form, first [[David Pleat]] and later [[Danny Wilson (footballer)|Danny Wilson]] spent small fortunes building squads that were ultimately ineffective, and the club's debts got out of control as a result.<ref name="guardian fanzine">{{cite web|title=Sheffield Wednesday |publisher=Guardian Unlimited fanzines|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/fanzines/story/0,,602504,00.html|date=[[20 November]] [[2001]]|accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref> Danny Wilson was sacked in March 2000 and his assistant [[Peter Shreeves]] took temporary charge but was unable to stave off relegation. The club's flirtation with relegation continued in Division One and after yet more managerial changes [[Chris Turner]] was hired as boss and made a strong effort to rejuvenate the side. However, a failure to beat [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.]] in the penultimate game of the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03]] season condemned them to another relegation.

After narrowly avoiding yet another relegation in [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] and a poor start to the [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]] [[Coca-Cola League One]] campaign, Turner was replaced by former [[Southampton F.C.]] manager [[Paul Sturrock]]. Sturrock revitalised Sheffield Wednesday's fortunes and they finished fifth in League One at the end of the 2004–05 season, qualifying for the promotion playoffs. Over 40,000 SWFC fans travelled to [[Cardiff]] to watch the Owls beat [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] 4-2 after extra time in the playoff final, and return to the Championship.<ref name="promotion">{{cite news|title=Brighton 0-2 Sheff Wed|publisher=BBC| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4906626.stm|date=[[17 April]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref> Sturrock guided Sheffield Wednesday to Championship survival in [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]] but was sacked after a poor start to the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07]] season and replaced by [[Brian Laws]].<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/6120136.stm</ref>

==Name and nicknames==
Sheffield Wednesday are the only English League club with a day of the week in their name. 

The club were formerly known as "The Wednesday Football Club" until [[1929 in football (soccer)|1929]], when the club was officially renamed "Sheffield Wednesday Football Club" under the stewardship of manager [[Bob Brown (footballer)|Bob Brown]].<ref name="Complete History 1920-35">{{cite web|title=Brown's Golden Era|url=http://www.swfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0,,10304~65721,00.html|publisher=FL Interactive Limited|accessdate=2006-08-12}}</ref> However the name Sheffield Wednesday dates back as far as [[1883 in football (soccer)|1883]]: the former ground at Olive Grove had the name Sheffield Wednesday painted on the stand roof.

Wednesday's original nickname was "The Blades", a common name for Sheffield clubs during the 19th century due to the city's links to the cutlery industry and now the nickname of their long-term rivals [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. At the start of the 20th century, when a player presented them with an [[owl]] mascot to honour their stadium at Owlerton, adjacent to [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]], the club became known as "The Owls".

==Colours==
Since its founding the club has played their home games in blue and white shirts, traditionally in vertical stripes. However this has not always been the case and there have been variations upon the theme. A monochrome photograph from 1874–75 shows the Wednesday team in plain dark shirts,<ref name="Romance of the Wednesday">{{cite book|last=Spalding|first=Richard A.|date=1926|title=Romance of the Wednesday|publisher=Desert Island Books|id=ISBN 1-874287-17-1}}</ref> while the 1871 "Rules of the Sheffield Football Association" listed the Wednesday club colours as blue and white hoops.<ref name="Football in Sheffield">{{cite book|last=Young|first=Percy M.|date=1962|title=Football in Sheffield|publisher=S. Paul}}</ref> A quartered blue and white design was used in 1887 and a blue shirt with white sleeves between 1965 and 1973.<ref name="Club Colours">{{cite book|last=Bickerton|first=Bob|date=1998|title=Club Colours|publisher=Hamlyn|id=ISBN 0-600-59542-0}}</ref> This design would have received greater notoriety had Wednesday not worn their [[kit (football)|away kit]] for all of their games in the 1966 FA Cup run, when all of their ties were drawn away. Given the option in the final of wearing their first strip, they chose the away strip for luck; but Everton managed to claw back a 2-0 deficit after 54 minutes and eventually won the game 3-2.

There is a superstition among many older Wednesday fans that the team tends to have a poor season when they abandon the traditional evenly spaced blue and white stripe designs in favour of some broad stripe or narrow stripe design. However in an age of marketing-driven decisions, the team only reverts to the familiar style every so often.

Wednesday have often favoured black shorts or, more recently, blue. There have been times where Wednesday have opted to play in white shorts, sometimes to minimise colour clashes with the opposing team. The socks were invariably blue and white hoops but these too have gone through changes including blue with a white roll over top, all blue and all white.

The away strip has changed regularly over the years although an all yellow strip has been used for many of the recent seasons in the club's history. Traditionally white was the second choice for many teams, including Wednesday. Other colours used for away kits in previous years include black, silver, green and orange. Wednesday have always avoided red as an alternative colour but for years had the players' numbers in red on the first-choice shirt backs, which was not easy to discern against blue and white stripes.

The current home strip consists of blue and white vertical stripes with black shorts and black socks. The change strip (used for away or cup fixtures where there is a clash of colours) is all yellow with blue trim. The [[goalkeeper]]'s home strip is all gold with black trim; the change strip is dark grey with yellow trim.

The 2007/08 kit is manufactured by [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]] with the home colours the traditional shirt of blue and white stripes, with blue sleeves, coupled with black shorts and socks (with the top of the socks blue).<ref name="Sheffield Wednesday 2007/08 Kit">{{cite web|title=Pictures of Sheffield Wedneday Kit|url=http://www.football-shirts.co.uk/fans/29|publisher=Football Shirts UK|accessdate=2006-03-21}}</ref> The club's supporters were given the chance to have input on the away kit selection and went for an orange shirt, shorts and socks with some blue piping instead of a green or white shirt.

==Grounds==
[[Image:Hillsborough panorama.jpg|left|thumb|783px|Panoramic view of [[Hillsborough Stadium]] taken from the South stand showing (left to right) West Stand, North Stand and the Kop]]
<br clear="all"/>

Originally, Wednesday played matches at High Field, where [[Highfield Library]] is now located but moved several times before adopting a permanent ground. Other locations included [[Heeley]] and [[Hunter's Bar]]. Major matches would be played at Sheaf House or [[Bramall Lane]], before [[Sheffield United]] made it their home ground.<ref name="Wednesday!" />

Sheffield Wednesday's first permanent home ground was at [[Olive Grove]], a site on Queen's Road originally leased from the [[Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]]. The first game at Olive Grove was a 4-4 draw with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on [[12 September]] [[1887]]. Extensions to the adjacent railway forced the club to move in 1899, when work began on [[Hillsborough Stadium]] at Owlerton, to the northwest of the city. The first game at Hillsborough was played on [[2 September]] [[1899]] and ended in a 5-1 win for Wednesday over [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]]. The stadium was originally named Owlerton Stadium but in 1914 Owlerton became part of the parliamentary constituency of [[Sheffield Hillsborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Hillsborough]] and the ground took on its current name.<ref name="About Hillsborough">{{cite web|title=About Hillsborough|publisher=FL Interactive Limited|url=http://www.swfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HillsboroughDetail/0,,10304~92607,00.html|accessdate=  2006-08-15}}</ref>

===Hillsborough disaster===
{{main|Hillsborough disaster}}

[[Image:Hillsborough Memorial.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Hillsborough disaster memorial]]

On [[15 April]] [[1989]] Hillsborough became the site of Britain's worst ever stadium disaster. The venue was hosting a [[FA Cup]] semi-final between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death after the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of the ground became overcrowded.

In the [[Taylor Report]], the result of the official inquiry into the disaster, Sheffield Wednesday were criticised for the low number of turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end and the poor quality of the crush barriers on the terraces there. However, the report concluded that the root cause of the disaster was the failure of local police to adequately manage the crowds. The police failed to direct fans away from already-full central pens; these pens had an official capacity of 2,000, which should have been reduced to 1,600 as the crush barriers did not conform to the [[Health & Safety Executive]]'s ''Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986''. Over 3,000 people had probably gathered in these pens shortly after kick off at 3.00pm, causing the fatal crush.<ref name="Hillsborough justice">{{cite web|title=The Hillsborough Football Disaster|publisher=Hillsborough Justice Campaign|url=http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/history/index.shtm|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref><ref name="Hillsborough HSE">{{cite web|title=Information relating to the Hillsborough Stadium incident [[15 April]] [[1989]]|publisher=Health & Safety Executive|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/foi/releases/hillsborough.htm|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref>

The Taylor Report gave 76 recommendations designed to improve safety at football matches in Britain. The most noticeable of these was the gradual replacement of terraces with seated areas in all grounds by the end of the 20th century.<ref name="Fire safety">{{cite web|title=Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sports|publisher=Fire Safety Advice Centre|url=http://www.firesafe.org.uk/html/premises/fs&spos.htm|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref> A memorial to the victims of the disaster stands outside Hillsborough's South Stand, near the main entrance on Parkside Road.

==Support==
Wednesday have enjoyed good support despite their recent decline in fortunes. They had the highest average attendance during both seasons in Division Two/League One <ref name="2004-2005 Division 2 Attendances"> {{cite news|title=2004–2005 League One average attendances|publisher=Soccer Stats|url=http://www.soccer-stats.com/divisions/attendances.asp?divno=3&orderby=4&asid=04|date=[[16 May]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> and continued the trend when returning to the Championship with the highest attendances in that division.<ref name="2005–2006 Attendances"> {{cite news|title=Best Supporters|publisher=Sheffield Wednesday official website|url=http://www.swfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/News/0,,10304~832378,00.html|date=[[23 May]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref> At the 2005 playoff final Wednesday took over 41,000 fans to the [[Millennium Stadium]].<ref name="Sturrock salutes fans">{{cite news|title=Sturrock salutes fans|publisher=BBC|date=[[29 May]] [[2005]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/4589659.stm|accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref>

Their most famous fan is Paul Gregory. Known to many as "Tango" or "Tango Man" due to his similarity to a character appearing in [[advertisement]]s for the [[Tango (drink)|eponymous soft drink]] in the 1990s, he takes his shirt off for every match.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|title=Hit or misfit?

Another famous Wednesday institution was the Wednesday Band, a [[brass band]] that played during matches. Although unpopular amongst many rival fans (and some home fans),<ref name="ground guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.yfh45.dial.pipex.com/wednes.htm|title=Sheffield Wednesday|work=Internet Football Ground Guide|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref> they have released several records and have been invited to regularly attend [[England national football team|England]] matches.<ref name="Unofficial history">{{cite web|title=Sheffield Wednesday history|publisher=Sheffield on the Internet|url=http://www.sheffieldontheinternet.co.uk/wed.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> They were often banned from away grounds and have now suffered the same fate at home.

Supporters groups include [[Wednesdayite]], an independent football supporters organisation which owns over 10% of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and The London Owls, an active supporters club for Wednesday fans living in London and South East England.

Sheffield Wednesday have had a large variety of fanzines over the years; examples include ''Just Another Wednesday'', ''Out of the Blue'', ''Spitting Feathers'', ''Boddle'', ''A View From The East Bank'', ''Cheat!'' and ''[[War of the Monster Trucks]]'', which acquired its name from the programme that [[Yorkshire Television]] elected to show instead of the celebrations after the 1991 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory over Manchester United.<ref name="About WOTMT">{{cite news|title=About War of the Monster Trucks|publisher=Guardian|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/fanzines/story/0,,602719,00.html|date=[[20 November]] [[2001]]|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>

==Rivalry==
Wednesday's main rivals are city neighbours [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Other rivals include [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and to a lesser extent [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] and [[Hull City F.C.|Hull City]].  Matches between Wednesday and United are nicknamed [[Steel City derby|Steel City derbies]] (as opposed to Sheffield derbies, which can be between any two Sheffield teams) and are usually the highlight of the season for both sets of fans. Famous matches include ''The Boxing Day Massacre'', a [[Football League Third Division]] match which took place at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] on [[26 December]] [[1979]]. A record Third Division crowd of 49,309 fans watched Wednesday beat United 4-0 and the game has become part of Sheffield Wednesday folklore, even inspiring a song.<ref name="ground guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.yfh45.dial.pipex.com/wednes.htm|title=Sheffield Wednesday|work=Internet Football Ground Guide|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref>

The two teams also met at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley]] for an [[FA Cup]] semi-final match on [[3 April]] [[1993]]. The match was scheduled to take place at [[Elland Road]] but due to pressure from fans and the sheer number of supporters wishing to see the game [[the Football Association]] decided to switch the game to Wembley and 75,365 fans made the trip down to [[London]] to watch the match. Wednesday took the lead through a spectacular [[Chris Waddle]] free kick before United forced extra time courtesy of a goal from veteran striker [[Alan Cork]], despite Wednesday completely dominating the game. [[Mark Bright]] eventually scored the goal that secured victory for Wednesday and earned the Owls bragging rights until the next meeting.<ref name="Derby">{{cite web|title=Steel City Derby|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/articles/2005/11/02/fa_cup_semi_final_1993_feature.shtml|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref>

Sheffield United have a better head to head record in [[Steel City Derby]] games, having beaten Wednesday 44 times. Of the last 10 encounters, Wednesday have won just 2 games against their rivals.

==Crest and mascots==
[[Image:SWFC pre-1970.jpg|right|thumb|125px|The original crest]]
[[Image:SWFC early-90s.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Mid-1990s crest]]

Since their move to Owlerton, the owl has become a theme that has run throughout the club. The original club crest was introduced in 1956<ref name="badge">{{cite web|title=The Club Crest|publisher=A. Drake|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~a.drake/owls/misc/badge.htm|accessdate=2006-09-11 }}</ref>and consisted of a shield showing a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch. The [[White Rose of York]]{{Fact|date=October 2007}} was depicted below the branch alluding to the home county of [[Yorkshire]] and the [[sheaf|sheaves]] of Sheffield ''(Sheaf field)'' were shown at either side of the owl's head. The club's [[Latin]] motto, ''Consilio et Animis'', was displayed beneath the shield.<ref name="crest">{{cite web|title=footballcrests.com|url=http://www.footballcrests.com/sheffieldwednesdayfc.htm|date=[[27 November]] [[2003]]|accessdate=2006-08-19 }}</ref> This translates into English as "By Wisdom and Courage".<ref name="motto">{{cite web|title=Facts and Figures|publisher=Sheffield Wednesday official website|url=http://www.swfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/StattoDetail/0,,10304~390134,00.html|accessdate=2006-09-11 }}</ref>

[[Image:SWFC 1970s.jpg|left|thumb|125px|The minimalist crest]]

The crest was changed in 1970 to a minimalist version that shows a stylised owl with a large round head and eyes perched on the letters ''S.W.F.C.'' Various different colours were used on this badge, regularly changing with the kit design. The predominant colours however were black and yellow. This version remained in use throughout the 1970s and 1980s before being replaced in 1995.<ref name="badge">{{cite web|title=The Club Crest|publisher=A. Drake|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~a.drake/owls/misc/badge.htm|accessdate=2006-09-11 }}</ref>

The new crest reverted to a similar design to the original crest. It again featured a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch although the design of both had changed. The sheaves were replaced by a stylised 'SWFC' logo that had been in use on club merchandise for several years prior to the introduction of the new crest. The Yorkshire Rose was moved to above the owl's head to make way for the words 'Sheffield Wednesday'. The word 'Hillsborough' was also curved around the top of the design. The club motto was absent on the new design. The crest was encased in a new shape of shield. This crest remained in use for only a few years, during which several versions were used with different colouration including a white crest with blue stripes down either side and the colouring of the detail inverted. Most recently the shield shape has remained but the detailed owl logo has been replaced, yet again, by the minimalist version, echoing the badge's course of history in the 70s. The most recent change was the addition of a copyright symbol in 2002.<ref name="crest">{{cite web|title=footballcrests.com|url=http://www.footballcrests.com/sheffieldwednesdayfc.htm|date=[[27 November]] [[2003]]|accessdate=2006-08-19 }}</ref>
