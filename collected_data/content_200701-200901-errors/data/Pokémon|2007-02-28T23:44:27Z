{{nihongo|'''''Pokémon'''''|ポケモン|Pokemon|extra={{IPA2|ˈpoʊ.keɪ.mɑn}}}} is a [[media franchise]] owned by video game giant [[Nintendo]] and created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]] around 1995. Originally released as a pair of interlinkable [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] [[Computer RPG|role-playing]] [[Computer and video games|video games]], ''Pokémon'' has since become the second most successful and lucrative videogame-based media franchise in the world, falling only behind Nintendo's ''[[Mario]]'' series.<ref name="UK paper names top game franchises ">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6164012.html |title=UK paper names top game franchises |accessdate=2007-2-26 |last=Boyes |first=Emma |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[2007-1-10]] |year= |month= |format= |work=GameSpot |publisher=GameSpot UK |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Pokémon properties have since been [[Merchandising|merchandised]] into [[anime]], [[manga]], [[Collectible card game|trading cards]], toys, books, and other media. The franchise celebrated [[Pokémon: Tenth Anniversary|its tenth anniversary]] on [[February 27]], [[2006]], and as of December 1, 2006, cumulative sold units of the video games (including home console versions) have reached more than 155 million copies.<ref name="sales release 12 01 2006">{{cite web |url=http://www.n-sider.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2543 |title=Nintendo sales through end of November revealed |accessdate=2006-12-01 |last=Behrens |first=Matt |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[2006-12-01]] |year= |month= |format= |work=N-Sider |publisher=N-Sider Media |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

The name ''Pokémon'' is the  [[romaji|romanized]] [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of the Japanese brand, {{nihongo|"'''Po'''c'''ke'''t '''Mon'''sters" |'''ポケ'''ット'''モン'''スター|'''Poke'''tto '''Mon'''sutā}}<ref name="The Pokemon Series Pokedex @ Gaming Target">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=6531 |title=The Pokemon Series Pokedex @ Gaming Target |accessdate=2007-2-28 |last=Swider |first=Matt |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work=Gaming Target |publisher=Gaming Target |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>, as such contractions are very common in Japan. The term "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the ''Pokémon'' franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 493 [[List of Pokémon|fictional species]] that have made appearances in ''Pokémon'' media as of the recent two-part [[Nintendo DS]] release of the Pokémon RPGs, the ''[[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|Diamond]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|Pearl]]'' versions. As is the case with the terms [[deer]] and [[sheep]], "Pokémon" does not have differing singular and plural forms, and neither does each individual species name, so it is gramatically correct to refer to many Pokémon just like referring to one Pokémon. Nintendo originally literally translated Poketto Monsutā – indeed, a "Pocket Monsters" game was created in early 1995.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} A naming conflict with the [[Monster in My Pocket]] toy range caused Nintendo to rebrand the franchise as "Pokémon" in early 1996.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The game's [[catchphrase]], in the [[Japanese language]] versions of the franchise is "ポケモンGETだぜ! (Pokémon Getto Daze! - Let's Get Pokémon!)"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}; in [[English language]] versions of the franchise, it used to be "Gotta catch 'em all!," although it is now no longer officially used except in the spin-off anime series ''[[Pokémon Chronicles]]''.

In November 2005, [[4Kids Entertainment]], which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pokémon representation agreement. Pokémon USA Inc., a subsidiary of Japan's Pokémon Co., now oversees all Pokémon licensing outside of Asia.<ref>"[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7615 Pokemon USA Moves Licensing In-House]," ''Gamasutra''.</ref>

==Collecting and playing==

The concept of the ''Pokémon'' universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of ''Pokémon'', stems from the hobbies of insect collecting and [[cockfighting]], the former being a popular pastime which ''Pokémon'' executive director Satoshi Tajiri had enjoyed as a child. Players of the games are designated as "Pokémon trainers", and the two general goals of most ''Pokémon'' RPGs for such trainers are to collect all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where that RPG takes place, and train a team of powerful Pokémon from those caught to compete against the trained teams of Pokémon owned by other trainers. Pokémon are trained and used for battle this way as a form of non-deadly competition in most instances of the ''Pokémon'' franchise. This applies to the video games, the Pokémon anime and manga series, and even the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]].

In any incarnation of the fictional ''Pokémon'' universe, a trainer that comes across a wild Pokémon in its natural habitat is able to capture that Pokémon by throwing at it a specially designed, mass-producible tool called a [[Poké Ball]]. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of a Poké Ball, that Pokémon is officially considered under the ownership of that trainer, and that Pokémon will obey whatever commands its new master and/or friend (depending on how that trainer treats Pokémon in general) issues to it from that point onward, unless the trainer demonstrates enough of a lack of experience that the Pokémon may rather act on its own accord. Trainers can then send out the Pokémon to wage a battle against another Pokémon depending on the circumstance, and if the opponent Pokémon is weakened enough by the trainer's Pokémon's attacks, the trainer can capture that second Pokémon with a Poké Ball and increase his or her collection of creatures. Otherwise, if a Pokémon fully defeats an opponent Pokémon in battle so that the opponent faints, the winning Pokémon gains experience and may [[level up]] like a playable character in a console RPG would if he gained enough experience. When levelling up, the Pokémon's specifications of battling aptitude increase, including strength, resilience, speed, and so on, and from time to time the Pokémon learns new battling moves. Many species of Pokémon possess the ability to undergo a metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger specie of Pokémon, and this is called [[Pokémon evolution]].

In the context of the main RPGs, each game's single-player mode requires the trainer to raise a team of Pokémon warriors to defeat many computer-controlled trainers and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a region for trainers to journey through, complete events, and battle opponents. Each game generally features eight especially strong trainers throughout the land, referred to as Gym Leaders, that trainers must each defeat in a Pokémon battle, and as a reward the trainer gets one of eight Gym Leader Badges. Once all eight badges are collected, that trainer is eligible to challenge that region's Pokémon League, where four immensely talented trainers challenge the trainer to four Pokémon battles in succession, and if the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, he or she must then challenge the Regional Champion, the master trainer who had previously succeeded the Pokémon League. If the trainer can defeat this last battle, he or she becomes the new Champion and gains the title of Pokémon Master.

{{main|Pokémon (video games)}}
The original Pokémon games were Japanese [[Console role-playing game|RPGs]] with an element of strategy, and were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the ''Game Boy''. These role-playing games, and their sequels, remakes, and English language translations, are still considered the "main" Pokémon games, and the games which most fans of the series are referring to when they use the term "Pokémon games." As of December 1, 2006, cumulative sold units (including home console versions) have reached more than 155 million copies.<ref name="sales release 12 01 2006">{{cite web |url=http://www.n-sider.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2543 |title=Nintendo sales through end of November revealed |accessdate=2006-12-01 |last=Behrens |first=Matt |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[2006-12-01]] |year= |month= |format= |work=N-Sider |publisher=N-Sider Media |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> This makes it the second biggest-selling games franchise ever, after Nintendo's [[Mario]] series.

All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by [[The Pokémon Company]] are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly [[chronological]] divisions by release; a handful of Pokémon from a subsequent generation appear in the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]], manga, or [[Pokémon Trading Card Game|trading card game]] before the main Game Boy games which demarcate the generation are released, but the anime, manga, and even (of late) the card game divides itself into sagas or generations by the same scheme as the games.

===First generation===
[[Image:Pokemon red box.jpg|thumb|Box art for the American version of ''Pokémon Red''.]]
This first generation started with [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']]. The first generation introduced the original 151 Pokémon ([[Bulbasaur]] to [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]], not counting the glitch Pokémon [[Notable glitches in the Pokémon video games|Missingno.]]), as well as the basic concepts of trading and battling Pokémon. In Japan, the first generation included ''Pokémon Red'', ''[[Pokémon Green|Green]]'', and later ''Blue'' (with changes to the artwork and dungeon layout), while other regions started with ''Red'' and ''Blue'' (both featuring the updated elements; ''Green'' was never released outside of Japan).<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/data/924467.html "Pokemon Green Info on GameFAQs"] ''gamefaqs.com'' URL Accessed February 23 2007</ref>

[[Image:Bulbasaur pokemon red.png|thumb|left|A level 5 [[Bulbasaur]] involved in a battle with another level 5 [[Charmander]] in [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'']].<ref> MacDonald, Mark; Brokaw, Brian; Arnold; J. Douglas; Elies, Mark. Pokémon Trainer's Guide. Sandwich Islands Publishing, 1999. ISBN 0-439-15404-9. (pg73)</ref>]]
This generation was completed by the game ''[[Pokémon Yellow|Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition]]'', loosely based on the anime, in which the player started with a [[Pikachu]] who refused to go into its [[Poké Ball]] and instead followed the player's character around. By turning around to face the Pikachu, players could get an approximate notion of how much their Pikachu "liked" them. This and other elements of ''Pokémon Yellow'' were similar to the anime. It also altered the progress of the game to more accurately reflect trainers and Pokémon seen in the animé, including the addition of Jessie and James, who are well-known members of [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]] to the storyline. Jessie and James bring along their signature Pokémon ([[Koffing]], [[Ekans]], and [[Meowth]]). Koffing and Ekans evolve later on, but Meowth does not.

These versions of the games revolved around the [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]] [[Pokémon regions|region]], though it was not known as such until the second generation. This generation also introduced the idea of a [[Blue (Pokémon)|rival trainer]] whom the [[Red (Pokémon)|player]] faced a number of times, as well as a team of evil Pokémon trainers.

These games were compatible with the [[Nintendo 64]] games ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]''. Remakes of the first two games, called ''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''Pokémon LeafGreen'', were released in the third "Advance" generation.
{{-}}

===Second generation===
[[Image:Pokemon gold.jpg|thumb|Box art for the American version of ''Pokémon Gold''.]]
Beginning with [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], the second generation introduced the next one hundred Pokémon ([[Chikorita]] to [[Celebi]]), bringing the total number up to 251; it also introduced the new [[Pokémon regions|region]] of [[Johto]]. Innovations included use of the [[Game Boy Color]]'s [[infrared|IR]] port for receiving a "Mystery Gift" item, day and night rotation, the concept of growing and holding [[List of Pokémon items#Berry|Berries]] (items with special healing properties), [[Poké Ball#Johto's Apricorn Poké Balls|Apricorns]] (for creating custom [[Poké Ball]]s with enhanced effects), the separation of the "Special" stat into Special Attack and Special Defense, decorative items to customize the player character's bedroom, and [[Pokémon breeding]], the latter of which allowed the player to obtain [[List of Baby Pokémon|baby Pokémon]] (a new class of Pokémon). Also, two new [[Pokémon types|types of Pokémon]], the [[:Category:Dark Pokémon|Dark]] and [[:Category:Steel Pokémon|Steel]] types, were introduced. Even the Pokémon themselves had some different properties, most notably being assigned [[sex|gender]]s. Previously, the only Pokémon to be specifically gendered was [[Nidoran]], which has an unusually high level of [[sexual dimorphism]]. Another notable, though minor change, is that [[non-player character|NPCs]] were given names and sometimes genders in addition to their basic title.

[[Image:Croconaw screen.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]'', portraying a player's Level 18 [[Croconaw]] battling a Level 13 [[Snubbull]].]]
The games also featured a new tool, the [[Pokégear]], a device which served as a [[mobile phone]], [[radio]], [[map]], and [[watch]]. The mobile phone function was used to communicate with in-game [[Non-player characters|NPC]]s for conversation or a potential battle. The radio station chosen could influence the rate at which wild Pokémon could be found. Several radio stations had specific in-game effects. The watch included the time and day of the week and the [[protagonist]]'s mother could change it from Standard Time to [[Daylight Savings Time|Daylight Savings]] (Summer) Time (and vice versa); keeping track of time was important because different Pokémon appeared or evolved at different times of day, and some events revolved around the time and the day of the week. The sun would shine from 4 a.m. until 6 p.m. (with a morning phase from 4 a.m. until 10 a.m.), and the rest of the time it would be night.

This generation of the games was completed by ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]'', which was most notably the only GBC-exclusive Pokémon RPG and the first which allowed the player to choose the protagonist's gender. It was also the first to feature Pokémon animations (the Pokémon would do its animation when encountered or sent out) and on-screen text to announce when the protagonist entered a new location. ''Crystal'' also featured a slight alteration of the encounter with the three [[Legendary Pokémon]] [[Raikou (Pokémon)|Raikou]], [[Entei (Pokémon)|Entei]] and [[Suicune]], in which the player would eventually encounter and capture Suicune in a battle from which it would not escape. However, the other two still had to be found in the normal way (random wild encounters).

These games were compatible with ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]''.
{{-}}

===Third generation===
[[Image:PokemonRubyEUBoxart.jpg|thumb|Box art for the European version of ''Pokémon Ruby''.]]
Taking somewhat of a step backward, [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] did not have an overt system of either time of day or day of the week, though a clock does exist to ensure that certain Pokémon which only evolve at specific times of day can still evolve. These versions also introduced the ability to grow berries in certain places, each which had set lengths of time for their flowering, and the ability to make "Secret Bases" in trees, bushes, or caves in which dolls, tables, chairs, plants, and other objects could be placed, much like decoration of the bedroom in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']].

The third game in this series was ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]'', which updated the [[PokéNav]]'s Trainers Eyes feature for a return to the mobile phone system of the previous generation (but modified, with no storage limit and informing players of NPC trainers awaiting rematches). ''Emerald'' version also saw a return of the Pokémon battle animation when encountering an enemy Pokémon. It was also possible to visit a special zone, the [[Battle Frontier]], which gave the game good replay value along with the possibility of catching monsters that were unavailable in ''Ruby and Sapphire'' (specifically, [[Sudowoodo]] and [[Smeargle]]). Pokémon Contest centers, formerly spread throughout all of Hoenn, were now concentrated in one single building in [[List of Hoenn locations#Lilycove City|Lilycove City]]. These three 3rd generation versions all appeared on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. 

[[Image:Pokémon Emerald screenshot.png|left|thumb|A [[Pokémon Emerald|''Pokémon Emerald'']] screenshot featuring an enemy [[Pupitar]] and [[Solrock]] fighting in a double battle against a player's [[Aggron]] and [[Smeargle]].]]
This generation was rounded out on the [[Game Boy Advance]] by [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], which were [[enhanced remake]]s of the first two Pokémon games, including: a playable female character (based on concept art for a playable female which was originally considered but unable to be implemented); new items and regions; move tutors; and all the features of the 2nd and 3rd generations, excluding the timekeeping system (an omission which rendered impossible time-based evolution) and, with the exception of the Japanese versions, [[e-Reader]] compatibility. ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' also initially shipped with the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter|GBA wireless adapter]], used in place of the [[Game Link cable]] for wireless battles and trading.

All five Game Boy Advance role playing games are compatible with the storage program ''[[Pokémon Box: Ruby & Sapphire]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]], as well as ''[[Pokémon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]]''. The first Pokémon RPGs for home consoles, these titles introduced the desert country of [[Orre]], as well as corrupted [[shadow Pokémon]], and "Snagging," the ability to steal/rescue them from their trainers and eventually "purify" them.

Unlike games in the second generation, third generation games cannot trade with previous games in the series, due to hardware limitations.
{{-}}

===Fourth generation===
[[Image:PokemonDiamondBox.jpg|thumb|180px|American gamecover of ''Pokémon Diamond Version''.]]
The fourth generation of Pokémon games debuted with [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. Leading up to the games' release were three side games - two versions of ''[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]'' and the stand-alone ''[[Pokémon Ranger]]'' are currently out for the DS in Japan since autumn of 2005 and early 2006 respectively. ''Pokémon Mystery Dungeon'' has since then arrived in North America, and ''Pokémon Ranger'' was released on October 30, 2006. A handful of new Pokémon from this generation, such as [[Weavile]], [[Bonsly]] and [[Munchlax]], have made cameo appearances in the seventh and eighth Pokémon movies (''[[Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys]]'' and ''[[Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]'', respectively), as well as ''[[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]]'' and the aforementioned side games. Many Pokémon were given evolutions or baby forms. Many Pokémon from previous generations, such as [[Electabuzz]] and [[Sneasel]], obtained new evolutions, while others, like [[Mr. Mime]] and [[Snorlax]], obtained "pre-evolutions". Of the 107 new Pokémon that were added in ''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', 25 are related to previously existing Pokémon.

[[Image:Poke12.jpg|thumb|left|An in-game battle between [[Weavile]] and [[Munchlax]] from a [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] of ''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]
The criminal organization antagonist to the player's character is called [[Team Galactic]]. In the summer of 2006, four additional new Pokémon (which made appearances in the ninth movie, (''[[Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]'') were revealed by ''[[CoroCoro]]'' magazine and the [http://www.pokemon-movie.jp Official Movie Website]. As for ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', the day and night system made a return, with two new times (sunset and late-night); and genders were even more different, with slightly edited sprites depending on gender (for example, female [[Butterfree]] have an extra black marking on their lower wings, female [[Wooper]] have shorter antennae than males, and female [[Scizor]] have larger abdomens compared to their male counterparts).<ref> [http://www.thepikaclub.com/web/newpokes.php ''thepikaclub.com''. New Pokémon information] ''thepikaclub.com''.. URL Accessed [[July 21]], [[2006]].</ref>  They are also compatible with the Advance Generation.

''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pokémon Pearl'' were released in Japan on [[September 28]], [[2006 in video gaming|2006]]. In North America, they are to be released on [[April 22]], [[2007 in video gaming|2007]].<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/pokemondiamond/news.html?sid=6163662 "New Pokémon to Make Diamond-and-Pearl-Studded Debut"] URL Accessed [[February 7]], [[2007]].</ref>

===Spin-offs===
[[Image:Torouze.jpg|180px|thumb|right|American Gamecover for ''Pokémon Trozei!'']]
The series has also diversified into various spin-offs, such as [[Pokémon Pinball|pinball]] games, [[Hey You, Pikachu!|virtual pets]], simulated [[Pokémon Snap|photography]], and [[Pokémon Dash|racing]]. A handful of these spin-offs are remade in subsequent "generations"; for example, ''[[Pokémon Pinball: Ruby and Sapphire]]'' is very similar to ''[[Pokémon Pinball]]'' but with newer Pokémon, and ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]'' is largely identical to ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]'' but for the compatibility with ''[[Pokémon Gold and Silver|Pokémon Gold, Silver]], and [[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]''. ''[[Pokémon Dash]]'' is a Pokémon-based racing game for the ''[[Nintendo DS]]'', featuring a Pokémon from the fourth generation, [[Munchlax]]. The second Pokémon game to be released for the ''Nintendo DS'' was ''[[Pokémon Trozei]]'' (also known as ''Pokémon Link!''), which came out on [[March 6]], [[2006]]. Other Pokémon games that came out are ''[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]]'', for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]], respectively. The most recent Pokémon game that came out is [[Pokémon Ranger]].

Nintendo produced a demo for [[Wii]] (exclusively for gaming news outlets such as [[GameSpot]] and [[IGN]]) known as "Big Pokémon Hunter," wherein the goal was to zoom with the controller and find different Pokémon in a ''[[Where's Waldo?]]''-esque scenario. The review of this demo is currently available at among many other sites.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Nintendo President [[Satoru Iwata]] confirmed, on June 7, that the Wii installment in the Pokémon franchise will be sub-titled ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]''. This game will feature online chat provided by the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. It is expected to debut a few months after the release of DS installments, ''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl''.<ref>"[http://www.cubed3.com/news/5349 Cubed3 Pokémon Battle Revolution Confirmed for Wii]" ''Cubed3.com''.

Two Pokémon, [[Pikachu]] and [[Jigglypuff]], were picked to appear as two of the 12 characters in Nintendo's fighter game ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'',<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000J2W7 ''Super Smash Bros.''

Pikachu appeared as an initially available character while Jigglypuff was an unlockable one. 
The pair returned in the 2001 [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] sequel, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. They kept their positions, Pikachu was still an initial character while Jigglypuff was still an unlockable character, but two new Pokémon also appeared, joining Jigglypuff as unlockable characters: [[Mewtwo]] and [[Pichu]].<ref>[http://www.nintendo.com/codegallery?gameid=m-Game-0000-587#m-CodeItem-0000-5887 ''Super Smash Bros.

In both games, many different Pokémon can be used in a match by throwing the Pokéball item. A randomly-chosen Pokémon is released from the Pokéball, using one of its attacks to affect other players. The Pokémon released are only from the first and second generation. (Third generation Pokémon were not included in the game because Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire were released 2 years afterward.)

In ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'', the player can collect many different trophies of a variety of characters from numerous Nintendo games, including several Pokémon characters.<ref>"[http://guides.ign.com/guides/16387/page_54.html Guides:Super Smash Bros.

One of the consistent aspects of most [[Pokémon video games|''Pokémon'' games]] – spanning from [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] on the [[Game Boy line|Nintendo Game Boy]] to the [[Nintendo DS]] game, [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] – is the choice of three different Pokémon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labelled ''Starter Pokémon''.  Players can choose a [[Pokémon type#Water-type|Water-type]], a [[Pokémon type#Fire-type|Fire-type]],<ref name=spy> [http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html ''Pokémon Ruby'' review (page 1)] ''Gamespy.com''.

===Pokédex===
{{Main|Pokédex}}
The [[Pokédex]] is a fictional electronic device featured in the popular ''Pokémon'' [[video game]] and [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]] series. In the games, whenever a Pokémon is first captured, its data will be added to a player's Pokédex, but in the anime or [[Pokémon Adventures|manga]], the Pokédex is a comprehensive electronic reference encyclopedia, usually referred to in order to deliver [[Exposition (plot device)|exposition]]. Of the fictional Pokémon world, Pokédex is used to refer to a list of Pokémon, usually a list of Pokémon by number.

In the video games, a [[Pokémon Trainer]] is issued a blank device at the start of their journey. A trainer must then attempt to fill the Pokédex by encountering and at least briefly obtaining each of the various different species of Pokémon. A player will receive the name and image of a Pokémon after encountering one that was not previously in the Pokédex, typically after battling said Pokémon, either in the wild or in a trainer battle (with the exceptions of link battles and tournament battles, such as [[Battle Frontier]]). More detailed information is typically available after the player obtains a member of the species, either through capturing the Pokémon in the wild, evolving a previously captured Pokémon, hatching a Pokémon egg (from the second generation onwards), or through a trade with another trainer (with a NPC or with another player). This detailed information includes height, weight, species type, and a short description of the Pokémon. Later versions of the Pokédex have more detailed information, like the size of a certain Pokémon compared to the player, or Pokémon being sorted by their habitat (so far, the latter feature is only in the ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''  versions). The [[GameCube]] games have a P*DA which is similar to the Pokédex, but tells you what types are effective against it and gives a description of their abilities.

===Anime series===

[[Image:Kantogroup.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Screenshot of ''Pokémon'' anime, featuring various characters, (from left to right); Brock, May, Max, Misty, Ash and Pikachu.]]

[[Image:Pokémon episode 1 screenshot.png|thumb|left|Ash Ketchum and Pikachu together in the pilot episode, [[Pokémon, I Choose You!]] ]]
After exiting the tournament, Ash, and his companions, proceeded to the [[Orange Islands|Orange Archipelago]], a group of exotic islands, to collect an ancient Poké Ball, dubbed the GS Ball, being studied by [[Professor Ivy]], to be returned to [[Professor Oak]]. After collecting the GS Ball, Brock decided to stay at Professor Ivy's lab, and Ash, accompanied by [[Misty]], and [[Tracey (Pokémon)|Tracey]], an avid Pokémon watcher, continued through the various Orange Islands, battling the gym leaders, collectively known as the Orange Crew, and obtaining Pokémon, such as [[Lapras]], and [[Snorlax]]. Ash finally battled the undefeated leader of the Orange Crew, [[List of Orange Islands Gym Leaders#Drake|Drake]], defeating his strongest Pokémon, [[Dragonite]], with his Pikachu, winning the tournament.

The first, and the most familiar, is ''Pocket Monsters'' or simply ''Pokémon'' (often referred to as ''Pokémon: Gotta Catch Em All'' to distinguish it from the later series), which details the adventures of [[Ash Ketchum]] as he travels through Kanto. ''Pokémon: Adventures in the Orange Islands'' followed his adventures in the Orange Islands, a place not accessible in the games, and ''Pokémon: Johto Journeys'', ''Pokémon: Johto league champions'', and ''Pokémon: Master Quest'' following him in Johto. These series are based on the first and second generation games. Accompanying Ash on his journeys were [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]], the [[List of Kanto locations#Pewter City|Pewter City]] Gym Leader; [[Misty (Pokémon)|Misty]], the youngest of the Gym Leaders sisters from [[List of Kanto locations#Cerulean City|Cerulean City]]; and later on, [[Tracey Sketchit]], an artist and "Pokémon watcher" who accompanied them in the Orange Islands in the second saga.

The saga continued in ''Pokémon: Advanced, Pokémon: Advanced Challenge, and Pokémon: Advanced Battle'' where Ash and company travel to [[Hoenn]], a southern region in the Pokémon World. Ash takes on the role of a teacher and mentor for a novice Pokémon trainer in this series named [[May (Pokémon)|May]]. Her brother [[Max (Pokémon)|Max]] accompanies them, and though he isn't a trainer, he knows massive amounts of handy information. Brock (from the original series) soon catches up with Ash, but Misty has returned to Cerulean City to tend to her duties as a gym leader. This series is based on the third generation games. Eventually, the Advanced Generation was continued with the ''Battle Frontier'' saga, which was based off the ''Emerald'' version and had some aspects of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''. 

The most recent series is the ''Diamond and Pearl'' series, with Max leaving to pick his starter, and May going to the Grand Festival in Johto. Ash, Brock and a new companion named [[Hikari (Pokémon)|Hikari]] then go through the region of [[Sinnoh]].

===Pokémon Trading Card Game===  	 
{{main|Pokémon Trading Card Game}} 	 
[[image:Dragonite Pokémon card.png|right|thumb|A typical ''Pokémon Trading Card Game'' card. ([[Dragonite]]) shown.]] 	 
The ''[[Pokémon (card game)|Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'' is a [[collectible card game]] similar in goal to a Pokémon battle in the video game series; players must use cards (with individual strengths and weaknesses) in an attempt to defeat their opponent by "knocking out" all of his or her cards.<ref> [http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/p_strategy/rulebooks/book_68.jsp#433 ''Pokémon Trading Card Game'' "How to play" guide] ''Pokemon-tcg.com''. URL Accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref> The game was first published in [[North America]] by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 1999.<ref name=wiz> [http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=company/pr/20030312b ''Pokemon Trading Card Game'' News; "Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire TCG Releases"] ''Wizards.com''. URL Accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref>	

However, with the release of [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] [[Game Boy Advance]] [[Computer and video games|video games]], [[The Pokémon Company|Nintendo USA]] took back the card game from Wizards of the Coast and started publishing the cards themselves.<ref name=wiz/> The Expedition expansion introduced the ''Pokémon-e Trading Card Game'', the cards in which (for the most part) were compatible with the Nintendo [[e-Reader]]. Nintendo discontinued its production of e-Reader compatible cards with the release of EX FireRed & LeafGreen. 
 
In 1998, Nintendo released a [[Game Boy Color]] version of the trading card game in Japan. It was also released in the US and Europe in 2000. [[Pokémon Trading Card Game (video game)|This game]] included digital versions cards from the original set of cards and the first two expansions (Jungle and Fossil), but also included several cards exclusive to the game. A sequel to this game exists, but was not released outside of Japan.

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of Pokémon}}

===Racism===
[[image:original Jynx design.png|thumb|right|The original black-skinned Jynx design and source of the controversy.]]
This original design of the Pokémon [[Jynx (Pokémon)|Jynx]] (seen to the right) bore a striking, but possibly coincidental, resemblance to entertainers in [[blackface]]. A strong case can be made for Jynx being a [[parody]] of or [[homage]] to the Japanese [[Ganguro]] and [[Yamanba]] fashion trends, which were extremely popular when Pokémon was first released. Blackface-influenced characters have appeared elsewhere in anime and manga - examples can be found near the beginning of [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s early [[graphic novel]], ''Metropolis'' and also can be found with [[Dragon Ball Z]]'s [[Mr. Popo]].

As Pokémon became more popular in the United States, this perceived similarity to a racist image from United States' past offended some. In particular, it had offended children's book author [[Carole Boston Weatherford]], who accused Jynx of being a racist stereotype in an article titled ''Politically Incorrect Pokémon'' in the magazine ''Black World Today'', shortly after the anime episode ''Holiday Hi-Jynx'' aired. Episodes later on are also either banned or cut in USA. (see anime)

In response to this controversy, in 2002, Nintendo changed Jynx's face from black to purple and its hands from blue to purple in Pokémon games, a change which would be reflected in the anime three years later in ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Advanced Generation]]''.
The act itself of changing Jynx could be seen as offensive and/or ignorant however, to Japanese culture.

===Animal cruelty===
The primary mechanism of Pokémon has been compared to the generally-outlawed practice of [[cockfight]]ing.<ref>"[http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/DS/Pok%E9mon+Mystery+Dungeon:+Blue+Rescue+Team/news.asp?c=1200 Hands on with DS' Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team]," ''Pocket Gamer''. Review dated June 13, 2006. URL last accessed February 23, 2007.</ref> Seen from this point of view, the game consists primarily of Pokémon trainers capturing and bartering in wild animals, coercing them to fight one another. It also sees various performance-enhancing drugs to give them an edge in the fight. Some people believe that this may encourage children towards acts of animal cruelty and illegal gambling.<ref>"[http://www.screenit.com/movies/1999/pokemon_the_first_movie.html Pokémon: The First Movie Parental Review]," ''Screen It!''. URL last accessed April 21, 2006.</ref>

Pokémon maintains a fan base that views the battling as a friendly competition between two teams of Pokémon and their trainers. Seen in this light, Pokémon are not being coerced to battle by their trainers. There are references to some Pokémon being territorial (e.g. [[Pidgeotto]]<ref>"[http://www.dltk-kids.com/pokEMon/adoptions/pidgeotto-p.html Pidgeotto Pokédex information]," ''DLTK-Kids''. URL last accessed April 21, 2006.</ref>), but it is vastly different to the aggressively territorial nature of roosters, who will maim the 'enemy' rooster until it or the other dies. Furthermore, trainers do not relish the idea of allowing two animals (or in this case Pokémon) to fight to the death, while they merely view from the edge of the ‘ring'. In both the games and the television show, the audience is taught that fighting is not necessarily a means to an end. In addition to all of the above, Pokémon do not actually die from battle; they either faint or are in other ways unable to battle. It is also brought up in the animated series that Pokémon trainers are fighting alongside their Pokémon, as opposed to simply issuing commands for them to follow. Team Rocket is often depicted using Pokémon for personal gain with no affection for them. In both the anime and the games, using Pokémon for "evil" purposes is looked down upon.

===Health===<!-- THE SEIZURES WERE CAUSED BY '''FLASHING''' RED IMAGES, STILLS WILL NOT BLIND PEOPLE!-->
{{main|Banned episodes of Pokémon#Dennō Senshi Porygon|l1=Banned episodes of Pokémon}}
[[Image:Pikachu seizure-2.jpg|right|thumb|One frame of the scene that caused the seizures.]]
On [[December 16]], [[1997]], more than 635 Japanese children were admitted to hospitals with convulsive [[Seizure|epileptic seizures]]. It was determined that the seizures were caused by watching an episode of Pokémon, "''Dennō Senshi Porygon''," or "[[Banned episodes of Pokémon#Dennō Senshi Porygon|Computer Soldier Porygon]]" (most commonly translated "Electric Soldier Porygon", season 1, episode 43) and subsequently this episode has not been aired since. In this particular episode, there were bright explosions with rapidly-alternating blue and red color patterns.<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/pokemon.html Pokemon packs a punch] URL accessed [[January 7]], [[2007]].</ref> It was determined in subsequent research that these strobing light effects cause some individuals to have epileptic seizures, even if they haven't had any previous history of [[epilepsy]]. As a consequence, many video game makers (including [[Nintendo]]) added warning labels to their [[video game]] products (or made pre-existing labels more prominent), warning that exposure to video games may trigger seizures in individuals vulnerable to [[photosensitive epilepsy]]. Detailed research of the alleged  incident is detailed at  [http://www.csicop.org/si/2001-05/pokemon.html here] and attributes it to mass hysteria. The incident was also parodied by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode "[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]]"<ref> "[http://web.archive.org/web/20041108175456/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/06/990601080722.htm Color Changes in TV Cartoons Cause Seizures]," ''ScienceDaily'' ([[Waybacked]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|Style Sheet(s)]] missing).</ref> and in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Chinpokomon]]."

==Cultural influence==
A live action show called [[Pokémon Live!]] toured the United States in late [[2000]]. It was based on the popular [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon anime]], but had some continuity errors relating to it. In late [[2002]], it was scheduled to tour Europe, but was canceled for unknown reasons, possibly due to lack of interest.

''Pokémon'', being a popular franchise, has undoubtedly left its mark on [[pop-culture]]. The ''Pokémon'' characters themselves have become pop-culture icons; examples include not one, but two different [[Pikachu]] balloons in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], a [[:Image:ana.b747.pokemon.arp.750pix.jpg|Pokémon-styled]] [[Boeing 747-400]], thousands of merchandise items, and a [[Poképark|theme park]] in [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya, Japan]] in 2005 and [[Taipei]] in 2006. Pokémon also appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] in 1999. The Comedy Central show ''[[Drawn Together]]'' has a character named [[Ling-Ling]] which is a direct parody of Pikachu. Several other shows such as ''[[ReBoot]]'', ''[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo|The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Chinpokomon|South Park]]'' and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' have made references and spoofs of ''Pokémon'', among other series.
