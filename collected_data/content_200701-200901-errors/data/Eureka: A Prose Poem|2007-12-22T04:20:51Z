'''''Eureka''''' (1848) is a lengthy [[non-fiction]] work by American author [[Edgar Allan Poe]] which he subtitled "A [[prose poetry|Prose Poem]]," though it has also been subtitled as "An [[Essay]] on the Material and Spiritual Universe." Adapted from a lecture he had presented, ''Eureka'' describes Poe's intuitive conception of the nature of the [[universe]] with no scientific work done to reach his conclusions. He also discusses man's relationship with [[God]], who he compares to an author. It is dedicated to the German naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].<ref name=Silverman339>Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York City: Harper Perennial, 1991. ISBN 0060923318  p. 339</ref> Though it is generally considered unscientific, many of Poe's theories predate later accepted scientific theories including [[Black Hole]]s.<ref name=Blackholes>[http://www.poedecoder.com/essays/lartigue/#Poe's%20Primary%20Part "Poe Foresees Modern Cosmologists' Black Holes and The Big Crunch"] URL accessed [[July 14]], [[2007]]</ref>

''Eureka'' was received poorly in Poe's day and generally described as absurd, even by friends. Modern critics continue to debate the significance of ''Eureka'' and some doubt its seriousness, in part because of Poe's many incorrect assumptions and his comedic descriptions of well-known historical minds. Presented as a poem, many compare it with his fiction work, especially [[science fiction]] stories such as "[[The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar]]." His attempts at discovering the truth also follow his own tradition of "[[wikt:ratiocination|ratiocination]]," a term used in his [[detective fiction]] tales. Poe's suggestion that the soul continues to thrive even after death also parallels with works in which characters reappear from beyond the grave such as "[[Ligeia]]." The essay is oddly [[Transcendentalism|Transcendental]], considering Poe's disdain for the movement. He considered it his greatest work and claimed it was more important than the discovery of [[gravity]].

==Overview==
{{wikisourcepar|Eureka: A Prose Poem}}

''Eureka'' is Poe's last major work and his longest non-fiction work at nearly 40,000 words in length.<ref name=Sova82/> The work has its origins in a lecture Poe presented on [[February 3]], [[1848]] titled "On The Cosmography of the Universe" at the Society Library in New York.<ref name=Quinn539>Quinn, Arthur Hobson. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biobraphy''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. p. 539. ISBN 0801857309</ref><ref name=Sova82/> He had expected an audience of hundreds; only 60 attended and were confused by the topic.<ref>Krutch, Alfred Wood. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A Study in Genius''. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1926. p. 180-1.</ref> Poe had hoped the profits from the lecture would cover expenses for the production of his new journal ''[[The Stylus]]''.<ref name=Sova82/>

''Eureka'' is Poe's attempt at explaining the universe, using his general proposition "Because Nothing was, therefore All Things are."<ref name=Sova83>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001. p. 83. ISBN 081604161X</ref> In it, Poe discusses man's relationship to God and the universe<ref name=Meyers214>Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 214. ISBN 0815410387</ref> or, as he offers at the beginning: "I design to speak of the Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical – of the Material and Spiritual Universe: of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny."<ref>Poe, Edgar Allan. [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eureka:_A_Prose_Poem ''Eureka'']]. (1848)</ref> He says that matter and spirit are made of the same essence.<ref name=Hoffman245>Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''. Louisiana State University Press, 1972. p. 245. ISBN 0807123218</ref> Poe suggests that people have a natural tendency to believe in themselves as infinite with nothing greater than their soul - such thoughts stem from man's residual feelings from when each shared an original identity with God.<ref name=Silverman340/> Ultimately individual consciousnesses will collapse back into a similar single mass, a "final ingathering" where the "myriads of individual Intelligences become blended."<ref>Whalen, Terence. "Poe and the American Publishing Industry," as collected in ''A Historical Guide to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by J. Gerald Kennedy. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 90. ISBN 0195121503</ref> Likewise, Poe saw the universe itself as infinitely expanding and collapsing<ref name=Meyers215>Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 215. ISBN 0815410387</ref> like a divine heartbeat which constantly rejuvenates itself, also implying a sort of deathlessness.<ref name=Silverman339/> In fact, because the soul is a part of this constant throbbing, after dying, all people, in essence, become God.<ref name=Silverman340/>

==Analysis==
''Eureka'' presents similar themes and sentiments as some of Poe's fiction work, including attempts at breaking beyond the obstacle of death<ref name=Sova83/> and specifically characters who return from death in stories like "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" and "[[Ligeia]]." Similar to his theories on a good [[short story]], Poe believes the universe is a self-contained, closed system.<ref>Peeples, Scott. "Poe's 'constructiveness' and 'The Fall of the House of Usher'," as collected in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe''. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 187. ISBN 0521797276</ref> In coming to his conclusions, Poe, in effect, is utilizing his literary device of "ratiocination," perfected by his character [[C. Auguste Dupin]], as if he was himself a detective charged with solving the mystery of the universe.<ref>Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''. Louisiana State University Press, 1972. p. 274-5. ISBN 0807123218</ref> ''Eureka'', then, is the culmination of Poe's interest in capturing truth through language, an extension of his interest in [[cryptography]].<ref>Rosenheim, Shawn James. ''The Cryptographic Imagination''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997. p. 199. ISBN 9780801853326</ref>

''Eureka'' seems to continue the [[science fiction]] traditions he used in works like "[[MS. Found in a Bottle]]" and "[[The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar]]."<ref name=Meyers214/> He further emphasizes the connection between his theory and fiction by saying that the universe itself is a written work: "The Universe is a plot of God," Poe says, <ref>Peeples, Scott. "Poe's 'constructiveness' and 'The Fall of the House of Usher'," as collected in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', Kevin J. Hayes, ed.. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 188. ISBN 0521797276</ref> and "the plots of God are perfect."<ref>Tresch, John. "Extra! Extra! Poe invents science fiction!" collected in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', Kevin J. Hayes, ed. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 121. ISBN 0521797276</ref> Even so, Poe admits the difficulty in explaining these theories comes in part from the limitations of language, often apologizing for or explaining his use of "common" or "vulgar" terms.<ref>Golding, Alan C. "[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1978101.htm Reductive and Expansive Language: Semantic Strategies in ''Eureka'']", collected in ''Poe Studies'', vol. XI, no. 1, June 1978. p. 1.</ref>

Poe's decision to refer to the piece as a "prose poem" goes against some of his own "rules" of poetry which he laid out in "[[The Philosophy of Composition]]" and "[[The Poetic Principle]]". In particular, Poe called the ideal poem short, at most 100 lines, and utilizing the "most poetical topic in the world": the death of a beautiful woman.<ref>Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''. Louisiana State University Press, 1972. p. 272. ISBN 0807123218</ref> The work also ventures into [[Transcendentalism]], relying strongly on [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], a movement and practice he had despised.<ref>Krutch, Alfred Wood. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A Study in Genius''. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1926. p. 185.</ref> Despite his criticism of that movement's incoherent mysticism, ''Eureka'' is more mystical than most Transcendental works.<ref name=Meyers214/> Poe himself suggested that the work be judged only as a work of art, not of science, possibly dismissing the seriousness of ''Eureka''.<ref name=Meyers215/> Though he is using mathematical and scientific terms, he may really be talking about [[aesthetics]]<ref>Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''. Louisiana State University Press, 1972. p. 279. ISBN 0807123218</ref> and suggesting there is a close connection between science and art.<ref name=PeterPage/> This is an ironic sentiment when compared to his message in the poem "[[To Science]]" where he shows a distaste for modern science encroaching on spirituality and the artist's imagination.<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. "Introduction: Poe in Our Time," as collected in ''A Historical Guide to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by J. Gerald Kennedy. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 11. ISBN 0195121503</ref>

The essay is written in a progressive manner that anticipates its audience. For example, Poe uses more metaphors further into the work in the belief that the reader becomes more interested.<ref name=Golding4>Golding, Alan C. "[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1978101.htm Reductive and Expansive Language: Semantic Strategies in ''Eureka'']", collected in ''Poe Studies'', vol. XI, no. 1, June 1978. p. 4.</ref> Poe's voice [[wikt:crescendo|crescendos]] throughout, starting as the modest seeker of truth, moving on to the satirist of logic, and finally ending as the master scholar.<ref name=Golding4/>

===Allusions===
*"[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]" - The title itself references the famed remark made by [[Archimedes]], meaning, "I have found it."<ref name=Silverman338>Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. Harper Perennial, 1991. ISBN 0060923318 p. 338. ISBN</ref> Archimedes used the term after taking a bath and discovering the concept of [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]].
*[[Epicurus]] - Poe refers to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosopher]] with the term "Epicurean [[atom]]s." Epicurus believed that [[atomism|atoms are attracted to one another in space]]. It has been suggested that Poe's exultation of the "false scientist" Epicurus is an indication that ''Eureka'' is really a [[satire]].<ref>Holman, Harriet R. "[[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1972202.htm Splitting Poe's 'Epicurean Atoms'; Further Speculation on the Literary Satire of ''Eureka'']]" collected in ''Poe Studies'', vol. V, no. 2. December, 1972. p. 33.</ref>
*[[Aristotle]] - Poe refers to the famous student of [[Plato]] as "Aries Tottle," who he claims is [[Turkey|Turkish]] and whose ideas come out of his nose like sneezes.
*[[Francis Bacon]] - The name "Hog" is a reference to the English philosopher and originator of the [[Baconian method]].
*[[Euclid]] - Referred to as "Tuclid," a student of Aries Tottle.
*[[Immanuel Kant]] - Poe describes Kant as the "Dutchman" who originated Transcendentalism.

The comical presentation of these well-known historical theorists, including the [[pun]]s on their names, suggests Poe intended ''Eureka'' to be a [[burlesque]].<ref name=Meyers215/> Alternatively, his criticism of these men indicate Poe's need to challenge their conclusions before making his own.<ref name=Silverman339/>

==Influence and significance==
''Eureka'' has been read in many ways, in part because Poe's sincerity in the work is questionable. It has been considered prophetically scientific, intuitively [[Romanticism|Romantic]], and even calculatingly ironic.<ref name=PeterPage>Page, Peter C. "[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1978201.htm Poe, Empedocles, and Intuition in ''Eureka'']," collected in ''Poe Studies'', vol. XI, no. 2. December 1978. p. 21.</ref> Lacking scientific proof, Poe said it was not his goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.<ref name=Meyers215/>

Though modern critics have dismissed ''Eureka'' for having no scientific worth or merit,<ref name=Meyers214/><ref>Krutch, Alfred Wood. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A Study in Genius''. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1926. p. 181.</ref> Poe's work [[Wiktionary:presage|presage]]s modern science with his own concept of the [[Big Bang]].<ref>Grantz, David. [http://www.poedecoder.com/essays/eureka/ "Edgar Allan Poe's ''Eureka'': I have found it!"] URL accessed [[December 1]], [[2007]]</ref> He postulated that the universe began from a single originating particle or [[gravitational singularity|singularity]], willed by a "Divine Volition."<ref name=Silverman339/> This "primordial particle," initiated by God,<ref>Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''. Louisiana State University Press, 1972. p. 282. ISBN 0807123218</ref>  divides into all the particles of the universe. These particles seek one another because of their originating unity (gravity) resulting in the end of the universe as a single particle. Poe also expresses a cosmological theory that anticipated [[black holes]] and the [[Big Crunch]] theory<ref name=Blackholes/> as well as the first plausible solution to [[Olbers' paradox]].<ref>''Wrinkles in Time'' by [[George Smoot]] and Keay Davidson, Harper Perennial, Reprint edition (October 1, 1994) ISBN 0-380-72044-2</ref> Many of Poe's conclusions, however, are speculative due to his rejection of analytic logic and emphasis on intuition and inspiration.<ref name=Meyers214/> 

''Eureka'' is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed [[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian principles]] regarding the density and rotation of planets.<ref name=Sova83/> He also incorrectly says that [[Johannes Kepler]] came to his conclusions not through science but through guesswork.<ref name=Meyers214/> For this reason, it has been suggested that what Poe demands is true in ''Eureka'' is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates.<ref>Peeples, Scott. "Poe's 'constructiveness' and 'The Fall of the House of Usher'," as collected in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe''. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 188. ISBN 0521797276</ref> If this is the case, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition, as suggested by poet [[Richard Wilbur]].<ref name=Meyers216/>

More modern critics also suggest ''Eureka'' is a sign of Poe's declining mental health at the end of his life.<ref>Krutch, Alfred Wood. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A Study in Genius''. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1926. p. 180.</ref> In the text, Poe wrote that he was aware he might be considered a madman.<ref name=Meyers215/> The lecture on which the essay was based was delivered only a few days after the anniversary of the death of his wife [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia]], suggesting a connection between the event and his new theories.<ref name=Silverman339/> Poe seems to dismiss death in ''Eureka'', thereby ignoring his own anxiety over the problem of death.<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 209. ISBN 0300037732</ref> 

Some modern critics also believe that ''Eureka'' is the key to deciphering meaning in all of Poe's fiction, as if all his works involve similar theories.<ref name=Hoffman274>Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''. Louisiana State University Press, 1972. p. 274. ISBN 0807123218</ref>

==Critical reception==
Response to ''Eureka'' was overwhelmingly unfavorable. Poe's friend Marie Louise Shew, who had helped his wife [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia]] on her death-bed, broke off their friendship because it offended her religious beliefs.<ref name=Silverman340>Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York City: Harper Perennial, 1991. ISBN 0060923318  p. 340</ref> After its publication, a vehement anonymous censure was published in the ''Literary Review''. This was believed by Poe to have been written by John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (1820-1889), a young theological student, who had previously criticized the work as [[pantheistic]] and "a damnable heresy" that "conscience would compel him to denounce."<ref name=Silverman341>Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York City: Harper Perennial, 1991. ISBN 0060923318  p. 341</ref> Literary critic [[George Edward Woodberry]] in 1885 thought the essay was based on a crude understanding of the science a student learns in school "rendered ridiculous" by absurdity and the density of his ignorance.<ref name=Meyers217>Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 217. ISBN 0815410387</ref> The lecture upon which ''Eureka'' was based also received negative reviews. Poe's friend [[Evert Duyckinck]] wrote to his brother that the lecture bored him to death and that it was "full of a ludicrous dryness of scientific phrase - a mountainous piece of absurdity."<ref name=Sova82/> A local newspaper called it "hyperbolic nonsense."<ref name=Meyers218>Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 218. ISBN 0815410387</ref> though one publication, the ''Courier and Enquirer'', called it "a nobler effort than any other Mr. Poe has yet given the world."<ref name=Quinn539/> Audience members said it was not persuasive or simply too long.<ref name=Silverman338/> Even so, Poe considered ''Eureka'' to be his masterpiece.<ref name=Meyers219>Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York City: Cooper Square Press, 1992. ISBN 0815410387 p. 219</ref> He believed the work would immortalize him because it would be proven to be true.<ref name=Silverman339/> In the [[Preface]], Poe said: "It is as a Poem only that I wish this work to be judged after I am dead."<ref name=Sova82>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001. p. 82. ISBN 081604161X</ref> After its publication he wrote to his aunt Maria Clemm saying, "I have no desire to live since I have done ''Eureka''. I could accomplish nothing more."<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 113. ISBN 0300037732</ref> He confided in a friend that he believed his contemporary generation was unable to understand it but that it would be appreciated, if ever, two thousand years later.<ref name=Silverman338/> Some critics, however, respond favorably to ''Eureka''. French writer [[Paul Valéry]] praised it for both its poetic and scientific merit, calling it an [[abstract art|abstract]] poem based on mathematical foundations.<ref name=Meyers216>Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 216. ISBN 0815410387</ref>

==Publication history==
''Eureka'' was published in a small [[hardcover]] edition in March 1848 by Wiley & Putnam<ref name=Sova82/> priced at 75 cents.<ref name=Silverman338/> Poe persuaded [[George Palmer Putnam]], who had previously taken a chance on Poe by printing his only [[novel]] ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' in England, to publish ''Eureka'' after claiming this work was more important than [[Isaac Newton]]'s discovery of gravity. Putnam paid Poe fourteen dollars for the work.<ref name=Meyers219/> Poe suggested an initial printing of at least one million copies; Putnam settled on 750, of which only 500 copies were sold that year.<ref>Tebbel, John. ''A History of Book Publishing in the United States – Volume I: The Creation of an Industry (1630-1865)''.  New York City: R.R. Bowker Co., 1972. ISBN 0835204898  p. 306</ref> Other accounts say Poe only requested 50,000 copies and that 500 were printed.<ref name=Sova83/><ref>Krutch, Alfred Wood. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A Study in Genius''. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1926. p. 183-4.</ref> Poe was given in advance the full payment of $14 from the publisher.<ref name=Quinn539/>
