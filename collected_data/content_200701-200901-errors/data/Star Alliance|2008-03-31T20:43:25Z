'''Star Alliance''' is the largest and most awarded [[airline alliance]] in the world, with the following points of cooperation among its partner [[airline]]s:

*[[Frequent flyer program]] integration allows airline miles to be earned and redeemed on all members of the Alliance at the same level (with the exception of certain deeply discounted classes) and lounge access by Gold card holders when flying in economy class
*Premium customers of the alliance have access to airport lounges of all members
*Flight schedules are coordinated to permit almost seamless travel which may include several different carriers within the alliance, on a single ticket
*Special fares for round-the-world and similar travel on alliance members offer discounts over booking individual itineraries
*Customer service processes are harmonized in an effort to promote a consistent experience
*Cooperation in development of a common information technology platform

== Customer service==

[[Codeshare agreement|Codeshare]] flights between theses airlines are, for the most part, seamless. This tight cooperation led to suspicions of anti-competitive behaviour, and the alliance was investigated by the [[European Union]] as a virtual merger of its members. Indeed, some speculated that if government regulations were relaxed, the members would merge into a single corporation<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/speeches/text/sp1999678_en.html Current issues arising with airline alliances: panel discussion. EUROPEAN AIR LAW ASSOCIATION. 11th Annual Conference. Recent developments in European air transport law and policy Lisbon, November 5, 1999]</ref>, although no evidence has yet materialized. Prior to Star Alliance, [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[KLM]] were operating together as the forerunners of the modern airline alliance system since 1993—although there had been even earlier pairings and groupings of airlines for decades on a less formal level.  The creation of Star Alliance was a milestone in airline history due to its size and sparked the formation of rivals, notably [[SkyTeam]] and [[Oneworld]].

The alliance developed the "regional" concept in 2004, which helps Star Alliance penetrate individual markets with the regional participation of smaller carriers. Regional Star Alliance members have to be sponsored by an existing full Star Alliance member.

Star Alliance members now fly over 17,000 daily flights to 897 airports in 160 countries utilizing a fleet of 3,087 aircraft. Its members carried a total of 405.7 million passengers with a turnover of 95.3 billion US dollars in 2006. The alliance's market share is 28% of the global market based on [[RPK|revenue passenger kilometers]]. All Star Alliance carriers combined employ over 350,000 pilots, flight attendants, and other staff. Star Alliance was voted best airline alliance in the [[Skytrax]] 2007 World Airline Awards.<ref>{{cite web|date=2007|publisher=Skytrax|url=http://www.worldairlineawards.com/Awards_2007/Allnc.htm|title=2007 World Airlines Awards - Best Alliance|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>

[[Image:thai airways b747-400 hs-tgj arp.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Thai Airways International]] in
[[Boeing 747-400]] is one of the founding members of Star Alliance]]  
All aircraft belonging to Star Alliance members display a large Star Alliance logo at the front of the aircraft.

In addition, various Star Alliance members paint their planes with the Star Alliance livery, usually featuring a white fuselage with "STAR ALLIANCE" signature written across and dark-blue tailfin with the Star Alliance logo. [[Singapore Airlines]] still maintains its own corporate logo on the tailfin, the only Star Alliance member to do so. Asiana Airlines was the first Star Alliance member to paint their aircraft in Star Alliance livery.

==Member airlines==

Starting in 2004, Star Alliance has divided its member airlines into "full members" and "regional members". Before being accepted as a regional member, airline must be sponsored by a full member.
Full members may have some affiliate airlines (that either are owned by or are in a contractual relationship with a Star Alliance full member). Affiliate airlines fall under full member umbrella in respect to the Star Alliance rules, policies and benefits. All of the affiliate airlines grant Star Alliance frequent flyer benefits, and usually feature the Star Alliance logo on their aircraft, public relation materials and advertisement. In some cases (such as [[Air New Zealand]] link airlines and [[BMI Regional]]) the branding of the "parent" full member may be so strong as to mean passengers are unaware of the affiliate's independent existence.

==Premium status==

Star Alliance has two premium levels, Silver and Gold, based on a customer's tier status in a member carrier's [[frequent flyer program]]. Each of the member and regional airlines recognizes Star Silver/Gold status, with a few exceptions (mainly pertaining to airport lounge access). The statuses have no specific requirements of their own; membership is based solely on the frequent flyer programs of individual member airlines.  Many member airlines also have an additional premium status beyond Gold which is not recognised across Star Alliance.

===Star Alliance Silver===
Star Alliance Silver status is awarded to customers who have reached a premium level of a member carrier's frequent flyer program.
