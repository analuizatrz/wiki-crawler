'''''The Power of Nightmares''''', subtitled '''''The Rise of the Politics of Fear''''', is a [[BBC]] [[documentary film]] series, written and produced by [[Adam Curtis]]. The series consists of three one-hour films, consisting mostly of a montage of archive footage with Curtis's narration, which were first broadcast in the [[United Kingdom]] in late 2004 and have been subsequently aired in multiple countries and shown in several film festivals, including the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]].

The films compare the rise of the American [[Neoconservatism|Neo-Conservative]] movement and the [[Islamist terrorism|radical]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] movement, making comparisons on their origins and noting strong similarities between the two. More controversially, it argues that the threat of radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organised force of destruction, specifically in the form of [[al-Qaeda]], is in fact a myth perpetrated by politicians in many countries—and particularly American Neo-Conservatives—in an [[Noble lie|attempt to unite and inspire their people]] following the failure of earlier, more [[utopian]] ideologies.

''The Power of Nightmares'' has been praised by film critics in both [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]]. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from conservatives and progressives.

==Synopsis==
{{double image|left|Wolfowitz press briefing, Nov 2001.jpg|135|Ayman al Zawahiri.jpg|145|[[Paul Wolfowitz]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], featured<br> representatives of Neo-Conservatism and Islamism respectively.}}
===Part 1: "Baby It's Cold Outside"===
The first part of the series explains the origins of [[Islamism]] and [[Neo-Conservatism]]. It shows [[Egypt]]ian civil servant [[Sayyid Qutb]], depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thought, visiting America to learn about the education system, but becoming disgusted with what he saw as a corruption of morals and virtues in western society through [[individualism]]. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by [[westernization]] under [[Gamal Abdal Nasser|President Nasser]] and becomes convinced that in order to save society it must be completely restructured along the lines of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] while still using western technology. He also becomes convinced that this can only be accomplished through the use of an elite "vanguard" to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and, after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can justly be killed for the sake of removing their corruption. Qutb is executed in 1966, but he inspires the future mentor of [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the [[1979 Iranian revolution]], Zawahiri and his allies assassinate Egyptian president [[Anwar Al Sadat]], in 1981, in hopes of starting their own revolution. The revolution does not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that the majority of Muslims have been corrupted by their western-inspired leaders and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they do not join him.

At the same time in the United States, a group of disillusioned liberals, including [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]], look to the political thinking of [[Leo Strauss]] after the general failure of [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson's]] "[[Great Society]]". They come to the conclusion that the emphasis on individual liberty was the undoing of the plan. They envisioned restructuring America by uniting the American people against a common evil, and set about creating a mythical enemy. These factions, the Neo-Conservatives, came to power under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, with their allies [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and work to unite the United States in fear of the [[Soviet Union]]. The Neo-Conservatives allege the Soviet Union is not following the terms of disarmament between the two countries, and, with the investigation of "[[Team B]]", they accumulate a case to prove this with dubious evidence and methods. President Reagan is convinced nonetheless.<ref name="trans1">{{cite web| title =Transcript: The Power of Nightmares—Part 1| publisher =DaanSpeak.com| url =http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares1.html| accessdate =2007-06-20}}</ref>

===Part 2: "The Phantom Victory"===
In the second episode, Islamist factions, rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his rich [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] acolyte [[Osama bin Laden]], join the Neo-Conservative-influenced Reagan Administration to combat the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet Union's invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]]. They are successful in repulsing the Soviet armies and, when the [[Eastern Bloc]] [[Revolutions of 1989|begins to collapse]] in the late 1980s, both groups believe they are the primary architects of the "[[Evil Empire]]'s" defeat. Curtis argues that the Soviets were on their last legs anyway, and were doomed to collapse without intervention. 

However, the Islamists see it quite differently, and in their triumph believe that they had the power to create 'pure' Islamic states in Egypt and Algeria. However, attempts to create perpetual Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to create revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by the use of terrorism to scare the people into rising up. However, the people are terrified by the violence and the government in Algeria use their fear as a way to maintain power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries as inherently contaminated by western values, and finally in Algeria turned on each other, each believing that other terrorist groups were not pure enough Muslims either.

In America, the Neo-Conservatives' aspirations to use the United States military power for further destruction of evil are thrown off track by the ascent of [[George H. W. Bush]] to the [[President of the United States|American Presidency]], followed by the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 election]] of [[Bill Clinton]] leaving them out of power. The Neo-Conservatives, with their [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] allies, attempted to demonise Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, however, the American people do not turn against Clinton. The Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the sufficiently safe Afghanistan and declare a new strategy; to fight Western-inspired moral decay they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.<ref name="trans2">{{cite web| title =Transcript: The Power of Nightmares—Part 2| publisher =DaanSpeak.com| url =http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares2.html| accessdate =2007-06-20}}</ref>

===Part 3: "The Shadows in the Cave"===
[[Image:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|200px|The Neo-Conservatives use the September 11th attacks, with al-Fadl's description of al-Qaeda, to launch the War on Terror.]]
The final episode addresses the actual rise of [[al-Qaeda]]. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri had little or no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent upon independent operatives to carry out their new call for [[jihad]]. The film instead argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden ''[[in absentia]]'' for the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]], US prosecutors had to prove he was the head of a criminal organisation responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, [[Jamal al-Fadl]], and pay him to testify that bin Laden was the head of a massive terrorist organisation called "al-Qaeda". With the [[September 11, 2001 attack|September 11th attacks]], Neo-Conservatives in the new Republican government of [[George W. Bush]] use this created concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new evil enemy, leading to the launch of the [[War on Terrorism]].

After the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|American invasion of Afghanistan]] fails to uproot the alleged terrorist network, the Neo-Conservatives focus inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist [[sleeper cell]]s in America. They then extend the war on "terror" to a war against general perceived evils with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq in 2003]]. The ideas and tactics also spread to the [[United Kingdom]] where [[Tony Blair]] uses the threat of terrorism to give him a new moral authority. The repercussions of the Neo-Conservative strategy are also explored with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-[[Taliban]] [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] without actual investigation on the part of the United States military, and other forms of "[[Preemptive war|preemption]]" against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved could later become a threat. Curtis also makes a specific attempt to defuse fears of a [[dirty bomb]] attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others altogether devoid of reality.<ref name="trans3">{{cite web| title =Transcript: The Power of Nightmares—Part 3| publisher =DaanSpeak.com| url =http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares3.html| accessdate =2007-06-20}}</ref>

==Content==
Adam Curtis originally intended to create a film about conflict within the [[conservative]] movement between the ideologies of Neo-Conservative "elitism" and more individualist [[libertarian]] factions. During his research into the conservative movement, however, Curtis first saw similarities in the origins of the Neo-Conservative and Islamist ideologies. The topic of the planned documentary shifted to these latter two ideologies while the libertarian element was eventually phased out.<ref name="cinescope">Koehler, Robert.

To help drive his points, Curtis includes interviews with various political and intellectual figures.

''The Power of Nightmares'' was first aired in three consecutive weeks on [[BBC 2]] in 2004 in the United Kingdom, beginning with ''Baby it's Cold Outside'' on [[October 20]], ''The Phantom Victory'' on [[October 27]] and ''The Shadows in the Cave'' on [[November 3]], although the death of [[Kenneth Bigley]] lead the BBC to curtail their advertising prior to its airing.<ref name="cata1"/><ref name="cata2"/><ref name="cata3"/><ref>{{cite news |first= Andy|last= Beckett|title= The making of the terror myth|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,12780,1327904,00.html|publisher= The Guardian|date= [[2004-10-15]]|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref> It was rebroadcast, in January 2005, over three days, with the third film updated to take note of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lords]] ruling from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial was illegal.<ref>{{cite news| title = The Power of Nightmares: The Shadows In The Cave| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3970901.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = [[2005-01-14]]| accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref>

In May 2005, the film was screened in a 2½ hour edit at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] out of competition.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.festival-cannes.com/index.php/en/archives/films/year/2005|title= All the Films—Festival 2005|accessdate=2007-06-06|publisher= Cannes Film Festival}}</ref> [[Pathé]] has purchased distribution rights for this cut of the film.<ref name="guardcanned"/>

As of [[January 1]], [[2008]], the film has yet to be aired in the United States. Curtis has commented on this failure:

{{cquote|Something extraordinary has happened to American TV since September 11. A head of the leading networks who had better remain nameless said to me that there was no way they could show it. He said, 'Who are you to say this?' and then he added, 'We would get slaughtered if we put this out.' When I was in New York I took a [[DVD]] to the head of documentaries at [[HBO]]. I still haven't heard from him.<ref name="guardcanned"/>

Although the series has not been shown on U.S. television, its three episodes were shown in succession, on [[26 February]] [[2005]], as part of the [[True/False Film Festival]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]], with a personal appearance by Curtis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truefalse.org/2005/films.htm |title=Films 2005 |accessdate=2007-06-06|publisher= True/False Film Festival}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| first = Pete| last = Bland| title = So True| url = http://www.columbiatribune.com/2005/truefalse/blog.asp| work = Inside the Slash| publisher = Columbia Daily Tribune| date = [[2005-03-01]]| accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref> It has also been featured at the 2006 [[Seattle International Film Festival]] and the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], with the latter awarding Curtis their Persistence of Vision Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlefilm.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=16640&fid=13 |title= Films/The Power of Nightmares; The Rise of the Politics of Fear|accessdate=2007-06-18 |publisher= Seattle International Film Festival}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sffs.org/fest05/titleDetail.asp?title_id=77|title= Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear, The|accessdate=2007-06-18 |publisher= San Francisco Film Society}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Thomson|first=David|url= http://www.sffs.org/fest05/awards/adam_curtis.html|title= Secret Histories|accessdate=2007-06-18 |publisher= San Francisco Film Society}}</ref>  The film was also screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, and had a brief theatrical run in New York City during the Summer of 2005.

Among [[conservative|conservative]] and [[neoconservative|neoconservative]] critics in the United States, ''The Power of Nightmares'' has been described as "conspiracy theory",  [[anti-American]] or both.

Davis and British commentator [[David Aaronovitch]] both explicitly labeled the film's message as a conspiracy theory, with the latter saying of Curtis "his argument is as subtle as a house-brick."<ref name="Davis_NRO"/><ref>{{cite news| last =Aaronovitch| first =David| title =Al-Qaida is no dark illusion| publisher =The Guardian| date =[[2004-10-19]]| url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1330499,00.html| accessdate =2007-06-06}}</ref> Attacks in this vein continued after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], with CBN referencing the film as a source for claims by the "British left" that "the U.S. War on Terror was a fraud" and the [[AIJAC|Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council]] calling it "the loopiest, most extreme antiwar documentary series ever sponsored by the BBC."<ref name="AIJAC"/><ref name="cbn">{{cite news| last =Hurd| first =Dale| title =How Leftists Aid Radical Islam| work =CBN.com| publisher =CBN News| url =http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/050715a.aspx| accessdate =2007-06-29}}</ref> In ''The Shadows in the Cave'', Curtis stressed that he did not discount the possibility of any terrorist activity taking place, but that the threat of terrorism had been greatly exaggerated.<ref name="trans3"/> He responded to accusations of creating a conspiracy theory that he believes that the alleged use of fear as a force in politics is not the result of a conspiracy but rather the subjects of the film "have stumbled on it".<ref name="awakened"/>

[[Peter Bergen]], writing for the ''The Nation'', offered a detailed critique of the film. Bergen wrote that even if [[al-Qaeda]] is not as organised as the Bush Administration stresses, it is still a very dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the resources available to bin Laden. On Curtis's claim that al-Qaeda was a creation of neoconservative politicians, Bergen said "This is nonsense. There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in 1988 by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation that implemented the 9/11 attacks."<ref>{{cite news| last =Bergen| first =Peter| title =Beware the Holy War| pages =3| publisher =The Nation| date =[[2005-06-02]]| url =http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050620/bergen/3| accessdate =2007-06-29  }}</ref> Bergen further claimed that, in fact, Curtis's arguments serve as a defence of Bush's failure to capture bin Laden in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and his ignoring warnings of a terror attack prior to September 11th.<ref>{{cite news| last =Bergen| first =Peter| title =Beware the Holy War| pages =5| publisher =The Nation| date =[[2005-06-02]]| url =http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050620/bergen/5| accessdate =2007-06-29}}</ref>

Additional issues have been raised over Curtis's depiction of the [[neoconservative|Neo-Conservatives]]. Davis's article in ''National Review'' showed him displeased with Curtis's depiction of Leo Strauss, claiming "In Curtis's world, it is Strauss, not Osama bin Laden, who is the real evil genius."<ref name="Davis_NRO"/> Peter Bergen claimed the film exaggerated the influence of Strauss over Neo-Conservatism, crediting the political philosophy more to [[Albert Wohlstetter]].<ref>{{cite news| last =Bergen| first =Peter| title =Beware the Holy War| pages =2| publisher =The Nation| date =[[2005-06-02]]| url =http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050620/bergen/2| accessdate =2007-06-29}}</ref> A 2005 review on [[Christopher Null]]'s Filmcritic.com took issue with ''The Phantom Victory'' 's retelling of the attacks on Bill Clinton, crediting these more to the American Religious Right than the "bookish university types" of the Neo-Conservative movement.<ref>{{cite news| last =Barsanti| first =Chris| title =The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear| publisher =FilmCirtic.com| date =2005| url =http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/c346566583f465df882570080065a710?OpenDocument| accessdate =2007-07-18}}</ref>

There are also allegations of omissions in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] was noticed by observers.<ref name="NYT"/><ref name="village"/> Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by experiences [[Germany]] during the [[Weimar Republic]] and alleged the film's failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to display Strauss as concerned with American [[suburban]] culture, like Qutb.<ref name="Davis_NRO"/> [[MediaLens]] criticised the film for failing to explore the role of big business in the situation it described.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.medialens.org/alerts/04/041207_Curtis_Response.html|title= The Power of Nightmares—Adam Curtis Responds|accessdate=2007-06-06 |publisher= MediaLens|date= [[2004-12-07]]}}</ref>

===Comparisons to ''Fahrenheit 9/11''===
After its release, ''The Power of Nightmares'' received multiple comparisons to ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', American filmmaker [[Michael Moore]]'s 2004 critique on the [[George W. Bush's first term as President of the United States|first four years]] of George W. Bush's presidency of the United States. The ''Village Voice'' directly named ''The Power of Nightmares'' as "the most widely discussed docu agitprop since Fahrenheit 9/11."<ref name="village"/> ''The Nation'' and ''Variety'' both gave comments ranking Curtis's film superior to ''Fahrenheit'' and other political documentaries in various fields; the former cited Curtis's work being more "intellectually engaging" and "historically probing" while the latter cited "balance, broadmindedness and sense of historical perspective."<ref name="Variety"/><ref name="BergenNation1"/> Moore's work has also been used as a point of comparison by conservative critics of Curtis.<ref name="Davis_NRO"/>

Curtis has attempted to distinguish his work from Moore's film, dismissing him as "a political [[agitprop]] film-maker"<ref name="guardcanned"/>
