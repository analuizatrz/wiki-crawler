{{nihongo|'''''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'''''|ファイアーエムブレム 蒼炎の軌跡|Faiā Emuburemu: Sōen no Kiseki}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[tactical role-playing game]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]], developed by [[Intelligent Systems]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. It is the ninth game of the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, the third game in the series to be released in [[North America]], and the first game in the entire series to be rendered in a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]], [[cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] manner. It is also the first ''Fire Emblem'' game to be released for a home console in [[North America]].

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'' is set on a fictional continent called [[Tellius]]. The storyline is all-new, and is completely unrelated to any of the previous ''Fire Emblem'' titles. The protagonist, [[Ike (Fire Emblem)|Ike]], the son of [[Greil]], begins the game as the newest member of his father's mercenary company, the Greil Mercenaries. The company operates within the borders of Crimea, a nation of humans (referred to as "beorc") that shares its southern border with Gallia, a nation of beast laguz, or humanoids capable of transforming into animals. A few chapters into the game, another neighboring beorc nation, Daein, invades Crimea, and soon after, Ike comes across an unconscious woman in a forest that turns out to be the Crimean princess, Elincia. Faced with the ruthless Daein assault, Greil leads the mercenaries out of Crimea and towards Gallia, but is mortally wounded by a Daein general known only as the Black Knight. These events mark the beginning of a long journey that will take Ike, Elincia, and the mercenaries across the continent and back in an effort to defeat Daein and restore Crimea's royalty to the throne.

Over the course of the game, Ike and his companions must overcome long-held racial tensions between the beorc and laguz in order to form an alliance against their true enemy, Ashnard, king of Daein. In particular, Ike manages to reestablish relations between the beorc nation of Begnion and the few remaining members of the heron laguz clan, which was annihilated in an act of [[genocide]] during the [[Serenes Massacre]]. With this accomplishment, Ike is given command of a patchwork army that he leads into Daein and finally back to Crimea, where he confronts the Black Knight and ultimately King Ashnard himself.

===The Fire Emblem===
In the Tellius universe, the Fire Emblem takes the form of a simple bronze medallion, also known as Lehran's Medallion, which holds the soul of an evil god whose energies disrupt the level of chaotic energy in a person. One such example was when [[Greil]] touched the medallion. It caused him to go mad and kill everyone in sight, including his wife. It was only when she took the medallion from his hand in her final moments that Greil regained his sanity. Greil cuts the tendons in his sword arm afterwards, thereby inhibiting his ability to wield Ragnell, to prevent causing any more damage. Only a person with the purest of spirits is capable of holding the medallion without losing his or her mind. Ike's mother and his younger sister, Mist, are two such people.

In the final chapter (of Maniac difficulty in the Japanese version and Difficult in the North American version), Ashnard uses the medallion after his initial defeat and gains godlike power, but is somehow able to remain sane. It may be that Ashnard's heart is so dark that he is able to channel the dark god's power from the medallion without losing his senses. Others say that it's because it was not possible for him to go more insane in the first place (hence his nickname "Mad" King Ashnard).

==Gameplay mechanics==
In comparison with previous ''Fire Emblem'' games, there are some changes to the game basics, as some classes have been removed and some have been added. Some of the most intriguing changes are the laguz changelings, humanoid creatures that can transform into powerful animals when a certain meter fills up. There are three species (beasts, birds, and dragons) divided into three classes each, although not all of them are playable. Beast laguz are divided into cats, tigers, and lions, birds into ravens, hawks, and herons, and dragons are divided into red, white, and black. Another useful addition is the Shove command, which allows non-mounted characters with a high weight to push other characters one space over on the map grid. There is also a new weapon forging system which lets players create their own versions of basic weapons or magic tomes at a greater gold cost. 

Like the previous ''Fire Emblem'' games, when a character falls, you cannot use them in battle ever again. Although some characters will not truly die if defeated (they will retreat and stay the sideline for the rest of the game), others will never be seen again, thus causing the chance of missed plot details and secrets left unrevealed. The characters are so integral to your force and so well developed that some players end up reaching for the reset button very often in the later chapters.

This installment of the ''Fire Emblem'' series is the first released in the US where the player does not necessarily need any items to promote a character (where a player changes a character's class to a new and often exponentially more powerful one). While some of the ones for the Super Famicom also had this feature, none of the US-released GBA games did.

Skills, which have appeared in some ''Fire Emblem'' games, have different mechanics in this game. Each character has a gauge that allows for mastery of skills. By mastering a skill (done by using one of many skill scrolls found throughout the game) a certain amount of slots are taken up in the gauge, usually determined by how useful the skill is. The space of the gauge varies between classes and characters. Any unit can learn any skill, with two exceptions. 
*The skill is preassigned to a unit and there is no scroll item capable of teaching it to others. 
*The skill is an occult skill. Occult skills are gained by using an occult scroll on any unit. The actual skill gained is class specific -- most notably, Ike's Aether and Volke's Lethality. Occult skills can only be learned by promoted units.

Bonus Experience is a unique feature to the game. At the end of every chapter, certain factors such as enemies remaining and turns to clear a chapter add towards experience that can be awarded to any unit at the base of any chapter. This function can be helpful for units who are too weak to battle, or units that you wish to level up quickly. This system was inserted due to the lack of arenas in Path of Radiance, which were used in other Fire Emblem games to train party members.

Additionally, this is the first Fire Emblem game released in America to feature a "Base screen" along with the "Battle Preparations" screen. Before the Base Screen appears, Soren provides information on the previous battle, including the units gained, casualties, most used unit in the chapter, and Gold and Bonus Experience gained. The Base allows for easy management of units, buying and selling items and equipment, forging weapons, and the distribution of bonus experience and skills. Furthermore, support conversations, which were triggered during battle in previous games, are now played through the Base screen. The Base screen is also home to special "Info" conversations, or chapter-specific conversations rated on a scale of one to three stars. One star typically denotes conversations that provide story background, two stars mark conversations that provide hints on how to proceed in the coming battle, and three stars indicate that the conversation may yield a special item or a new recruit.

Releases outside of Japan omit the extremely hard "Maniac" mode, replacing it with an "Easy" mode and a recalibrated "Difficult" mode that uses some elements of the Maniac difficulty.

==Graphics engine==
''Path of Radiance'' is the first ''Fire Emblem'' title to feature three-dimensional graphics on the battlefield, replacing two-dimensional sprite animations and landscapes with fully-rendered 3-D models. It is also the first game in the series to make use of [[Full Motion Video]] to present cinematic sequences at key points in the game. The FMV sequences were produced by [[Production I.G.]], an animation company that has produced work for numerous Japanese video games, films and animated series.

==Characters==
{{spoiler}}
This section summarizes only the major characters of the game. For in-depth character information and information about minor characters, please see the ''[[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance]]'' article.

===The Greil Mercenaries and their allies===
The characters listed in this section are members of the Greil Mercenaries, who fight to restore the nation of Crimea to proper order, and the various men and women that provide important assistance to their cause along the way.
*'''[[Ike (Fire Emblem)|Ike]]''' ([[Ranger (character class)|Ranger]])
:The son of Greil, leader of the Greil Mercenaries, who takes over leadership after his father is killed by the [[Black Knight]]. For the majority of the game, he is in the service of Princess Elincia, his employer. He holds a personal grudge against the Black Knight and seeks revenge for his father's death. After chapter 17 of the game, he upgrades to the class of Lord. Ike is the only character in the game that can wield the mighty Ragnell, counter-part of the Black Knight's Alondite. Both swords are blessed by the goddess. Ragnell is the only weapon in the game powerful enough to penetrate King Daein and the Black Knight's enchanted armors. It is notable that Ike is the first (and as of now only) character of the "Lord" class that is not of noble blood.  However, he comes pretty close with the fact that his father Greil was once Known as Gawain, one of the four riders of Daein.
*'''Elincia''' (Princess Crimea)
:Elincia, Princess of Crimea and only remaining member of the Crimean bloodline, employs Greil's Mercenaries for the greater part of this game, eventually joining in Chapter 26. She carries the sword Amiti, a unique blessed weapon that only she can wield. Amiti is similar to the Brave weapons, in that it allows her to double her number of attacks.
*'''Mist''' ([[Cleric (character class)|Cleric]])
:Sister of Ike, Mist is a gentle girl who keeps a medallion that once belonged to her mother with her at all times. Unbeknownst to her, the medallion is actually Lehran's Medallion; the Fire Emblem. Disliking constantly being left behind when her brother enters the battlefield, she eventually forces her way into the mercenary company's ranks by use of her skills with a healing staff. Mist is one of only a few beorc with a spirit gentle enough to keep the medallion's chaotic energies in check when held in her grasp.
*'''[[Greil]]''' ([[Hero]])
:Ike's father, and the founder of the Greil Mercenaries. He was once known as General Gawain, one of the Riders of Daein, but fled his homeland with his wife for reasons that become clear late in the game. Before chapter eight, he dies in a duel with a former pupil, the Black Knight.
*'''Titania''' ([[Paladin]])
:Greil's most trusted companion and co-founder of the Greil Mercenaries. She was formerly a Crimean Knight, but left them for reasons that are not revealed in the game. As an experienced fighter, she aids Ike in his quest by giving advice and providing support in the early chapters of the game.
*'''Soren''' ([[wizard (character class)|Mage]])
:The group's strategist and somewhat of a secretary, he uses a blunt manner of speech that makes him appear heartless, but he is actually rather intelligent and dictates his strategies with logic rather than emotion. His cold attitude often clashes with other members of the group. Ike is his only friend. In actuality, he is one of the 'branded', or a beorc-laguz hybrid commonly shunned by all. He is the first mage to join the mercenaries.
*'''Volke''' ([[Thief]])
:Initially, Volke approaches Ike's company as an old associate of Greil, saying that he has an important intelligence report to give them. However, he refuses to deliver this report until Ike can gather together 50,000 gold as a fee. As it turns out, both the report and Volke's claim that he is a thief are a ruse. Volke is actually an assassin, who was hired by Greil many years ago after being driven berserk by Lehran's Medallion. Volke's job was to constantly tail Greil and kill him should he ever lose his mind again. Volke was also entrusted with passing the history of the medallion on to Ike. Volke can open doors and chests without keys, as well as stealing items and unequipped weapons from enemies, but he will charge you 50 gold each time he provides this service.
*'''The Apostle/Apostle Sanaki'''
:The political and religious leader of the Begnion Theocracy, Apostle Sanaki is a young girl that is said to be the vessel of the goddess Ashera. At first, she treats Ike and Elincia coldly and with disdain, but it is in fact a ruse, as she needs Ike's help in uncovering a laguz slave-trading ring that other Begnion nobles are participating in. Her greatest desire is to atone for the genocide her people committed on the heron tribe twenty years earlier.
*'''Sephiran''' ([[Bishop]])
:The prime minister of Begnion, Sephiran travels the continent in disguise as a monk to learn the whereabouts of the Fire Emblem. Ike first encounters him after setting him free from a prison that was taken over by Daein. Sephiran later explains Elincia's plight to the apostle prior to the mercenaries' arrival in Begnion.  At the end of the game he speaks with Ike about the possible impact of the war with Daien.
*'''Reyson''' (Bird Tribe - Heron)
:The prince of the heron tribe, and one of the few herons that survived the Serenes Massacre. Initially, he bears a hatred for all humans, but after seeing Ike save his sister Leanne from Oliver, he finds it within himself to see that not all beorc are evil.
*'''Leanne''' (Bird Tribe - Heron)
:Reyson's sister, she slept in the remains of Serenes Forest for twenty years before she was discovered by Ike and the Greil Mercenaries. Like all herons, she is frail and delicate, but her lack of contact with beorc prevents her from speaking anything but the ancient language of the heron tribe.
*'''Ena''' (Red Dragon)
:Initially, an enemy to Ike and company. She is introduced at the beginning of the game as a mysterious woman acting as a tactician for Petrine. She is later promoted to general and battles Ike at the Daein capital. It is here that the player finds out Ena is a laguz of the dragon tribe. She is almost killed by the Black Knight after her failure, but Ike saves her. She is the only granddaughter of Nasir.
*'''Nasir''' (White Dragon)
:Hundreds of years old, Nasir is a laguz of the Goldoan dragons who went to great lengths to change his appearance and habits to seem more human. He assists Ike and Elincia a great deal (bringing them to Begnion and also providing information about Daein's Army), but works as a double-agent for Daein in order to aid and protect Ena, his granddaughter.
*'''Ranulf''' (Beast Tribe - Cat)
:The assistant of King Caineghis, Ranulf knows little of the beorc race. After meeting Ike near the beginning of the game, he learns that not all beorc are evil-spirited. He is unable to help Ike, however, until later in the story, having many duties to attend to.
*'''Lethe''' (Beast Tribe - Cat)
:Like Ranulf, she is a loyal servant and fierce warrior of King Caineghis. Her feelings toward beorc are quite distasteful because of the injustice they brought against laguz. As she fights alongside Ike and his mercenaries, she realizes that not all beorc are bad, and grows fond of the ones she trusts.
*'''Mordecai''' (Beast Tribe - Tiger)
:Mordecai is a subordinate of Lethe. He is strong and fearful on the outside, but inside he has a just and kind spirit. He and Lethe join Ike's band of mercenaries as envoys of their nation.
*'''Tibarn''' (Bird Tribe - Hawk)
:The king of Phoenicis, and nicknamed the hawk king. Initially, he held a very deep resentment towards beorc and had already resolved to destroy them. However, Ike changes his perspective and he aids Ike in the war.
*'''Naesala''' (Bird Tribe - Raven)
:The king of Kilvas, Naesala, is first introduced as a villainous laguz of the ravens (or crows). To improve the fortunes of his country, he is willing to do whatever it takes, including betraying his oldest friend Reyson. In Chapter 19, he begins to see the errors of his ways after to talking to Reyson, but remains arrogant and aloof despite choosing to aid Ike's cause.
*'''Caineghis''' (Beast Tribe - Lion)
:The king of Gallia, of the beast tribe. He aids Ike and the group a great deal at the beginning of the game, and his roars from afar cause the Black Knight to retreat without killing Ike. He has a deep respect for Ike's parents as well as the Princess Crimea's, as they were the few beorc who worked hard to reestablish a trusting and peaceful bond between laguz and beorc.

===Major antagonists and villains===
The characters in this section are the most notable of the adversaries that Ike and the mercenaries face on their journey. 
*'''Ashnard''' (King Daein)
:The king of the nation of Daein, Ashnard wages war on Crimea in an effort to ignite a continent-wide conflict. His goal is to obtain Lehran's Medallion, the Fire Emblem, which holds the spirit of an evil god that thrives on chaotic energies. Although he obtains the medallion and makes numerous efforts to sow the seeds of war across Tellius, he is ultimately defeated at the end of the game despite being able to touch the medallion and increase his strength through madness. He was unsuccessful at summoning the dark god, despite his last attempt.
*'''Shiharam''' (Wyvern Lord)
:Jill's father, and a former Begnion soldier. Years before, he and his entire Wyvern unit defected from Begnion to join Daein (in an attempt to end or slow the corruption of the Begnion senate), and he worked hard to make sure that his men and his daughter could be accepted as true Daein soldiers. Petrine orders him and his unit to flood Daein lands in an effort to slow Ike's forces down. Although he doesn't want to open the floodgate since doing so would damage land and crops owned by Daein commoners, he follows orders, but sends Haar away so that he may survive the battle.  If Jill enters combat or gets near Shiharam she will join Daein's side and flee unless she has a B or better support with Lethe.
*'''Oliver''' ([[Bishop]])
:A corpulent, egotistical bishop and senator of Begnion, Oliver secretly deals in the slave trade of laguz, as well as buying valuable items Naesala's crows steal from ships at sea. Upon seeing Reyson, he convinces Naesala to sell the heron prince to him for an enormous sum, thinking of him as a work of art. Oliver's misdeeds are eventually uncovered by the Greil Mercenaries, and he meets his end in Serenes Forest when he tries to capture Leanne, seemingly gone totally mad.

===The Four Riders of Daein===
The Four Riders are a quartet of Daein's most powerful officers. They do not appear in proper battle until the last third of the game.
*'''The Black Knight''' ([[General]])
:One of the most powerful enemies in the game. The Black Knight's identity is kept a secret, save for the fact that he was once a student of the former General Gawain. After killing Greil, he becomes Ike's mortal enemy, and he spends much of the game performing acts to enable Ashnard's efforts. His weapon and armor are blessed by the goddess, making him invulnerable to almost all but an equally blessed weapon.  In fact, even if a player's damage rate is higher than the black knight's defence number, they still will not inflict damage unless the equipped weapon is the Ragnell. He also carries arcane powder that allows him to teleport great distances instantaneously at the cost of stamina.  Some think that The Black Knight may be Zelgius, a General that aids Ike and his forces.  The reason for this belief is that, through hacking, players have obtained Zelgius as a character, and his stats are equal to The Black Knight's.
*'''Petrine''' ([[Paladin]])
:Petrine is a beautiful woman, but also a battle-hardened soldier. She has absolutely no tolerance for incompetence and cowardice; the only person that she fears is her liege, Ashnard, and his right hand, the Black Knight. She faces off with Greil early on in the game and is unable to defeat him (although he didn't defeat her either). She is best known for wielding a magical lance imbued with the power of fire.  Petrine is one of the "Branded" (half Beorc, half Laguz, and generally hated by both races), bearing a mark on her right breast, as revealed in a combat conversation between her and Soren when they face off.

*'''Bryce''' ([[General]])
:One of the Four Riders of Daein, dating back to the era of the previous Daein king. Bryce is a noble soldier and loyal to his nation; even after learning that Ashnard rose to power by killing everyone else that stood in line to ascend to the throne, he remains a Daein soldier to the end and dies honorably in battle. Besides Ashnard, he is also the only general in the Final Battle to have a quote before battling.
*'''Bertram''' ([[Paladin]])
:A mysterious general dispatched to stop Ike's advance to the Crimean capital in Chapter 26. Like the Black Knight, Bertram has never removed his armor and thus his appearance is a mystery. Unlike the other generals, he seems to have little intelligence as he is only able to mutter few words. He may have been suffering or under someone's control as when he finally meets Ike, he asks Ike to kill him. It is thought by many that he is Lord Renning, King Crimea's brother and Elincia's uncle due to the fact that his portrait pose and Renning's portrait pose are almost identical. This theory is provided because earlier in the game/story conversations state that the kings brother is alive but the characters never see him after that point in the story/game, and on the level that Ike and the Griel mercenaries face him, Soren says that he rose quickly to power after Crimea's initial defeat, and nothing is known about his background or heritage, including his family. The truth behind the identities of Bertram and the Black Knight may be revealed in "Fire Emblem: Goddess of Dawn".

==Reviews==
The game received mostly positive reviews after its release. Game Rankings, a website that provides video games with percentile scores based on the score average collected from a variety of review sources rated the game with an 86%.[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/920189.asp]

The following is a sample of the positive review scores that ''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'' received upon its release in North America:

*[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]: 8.0, 8.5, 8.0 out of 10
*[[Nintendo Power]]: 9.5/10
*[[GameSpot]]: 8.6 out of 10
*[[GamePro]]: 4.0 out of 5
*[[X-Play]]: 4 out of 5
*[[IGN]]: 8.7 out of 10
*[[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Games]]: 4 out of 5
*[[Game Informer]]: 9 out of 10
*[[JIVE Magazine|Jive Magazine]]: 5 out of 5 stars

==Trivia==
*Although Greil appears in the game's instruction manual in a picture accompanying the description of the "Hero" unit and in the prologue as a Hero "unit", he is never actually enabled as a playable character. There are rumors suggesting that he may become playable on the bonus maps should the player beat the game twenty times, but these rumors are untrue. But he does contain data in the game and, through cheating devices, can be made playable.
*It is possible to unlock some of the boss characters for use in the bonus trial maps by beating the game multiple times. In order, they are Oliver (3 times), Shiharam (5 times), Petrine (7 times), Bryce (10 times), and Ashnard (15 times).
*Many battle animations in ''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'' are based on those in ''[[Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu]]''. "Side Battle," the musical score used on the trial maps, was also from Chapter 10 in that game.
*Song #30, "Vow", is a remade version of [[Fire Emblem (Game Boy Advance)|Fire Emblem]]'s Song #47, "A Knight's Oath".
*Song #63, "Life Returns" (the credits) is the first song in the Fire Emblem series to have lyrics, supposedly sung in the made-up language Galldr (the language of the Herons), but apparently it's all just backwards Japanese.
*This is the first American released game where the units stay in their position after attacking instead of going back to the space they were occupying before they attacked.
*''[[Fire Emblem: The Goddess of Dawn]]'' for the [[Wii]] will be set in the same universe as ''Path of Radiance'', confirmed to be three years after Path of Radiance events{{fact}}. One of the earliest characters confirmed to appear in the game is Sothe, who appears to be several years older in early promotional artwork for the game.
