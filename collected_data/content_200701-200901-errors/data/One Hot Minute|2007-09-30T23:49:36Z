'''''One Hot Minute''''' is the sixth album by [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released on [[September 12]], [[1995]] on [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The worldwide success of the band's previous album caused guitarist [[John Frusciante]] uncomfortable, and he quit mid-tour in 1992. [[Dave Navarro]] was hired to replace Frusciante on guitar, though his presence would alter the band's sound considerably. ''One Hot Minute'' contained far darker, more suicidal and less sexual themes than previous records, integrating excessive use of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] guitar riffs. Vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]], who had resumed addictions to [[Amphetamine|speed]] and [[heroin]] in 1994 after being sober for more than five years, approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook on drugs and their harsh effects. 

The record produced three successful hits, including "[[Warped]]", "[[My Friends (song)|My Friends]]", and "[[Aeroplane (song)|Aeroplane]]". Although ''One Hot Minute'' would eventually sell over five million copies, it was half of what ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' sold and in comparison became both a commercial and critical disappointment. Navarro was eventually fired from the band due to creative differences in 1997. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[All Music Guide]] said that "''One Hot Minute'' is as musically ambitious as ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', but is even more unfocused, which means it provides the fewest thrills of any of the group's albums."<ref name=OHMAMG>{{Cite web|url=http://wc10.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fpfwxq9hldfe|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''One Hot Minute'' album review|accessdate=2007-09-18|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> 

==Background==
Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988 after original guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]] died of a heroin overdose.<ref name=rhcpbio>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:difrxqr5ldje~T1|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Biography|accessdate=2007-07-22|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> They recorded their first album together in 1989; ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' would peak at #52 on the [[Billboard Top 200]] becoming the band's first gold record [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/more.jsp?tp=albums&pid=5507&aid=14133 | title=Mother's Milk | accessdate=2007-06-07 | publisher=''Billboard Magazine''}}</ref><ref name=RIAA>{{Cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=Certification search|accessdate=2007-09-21|publisher=RIAA}}</ref> Although relatively successful, production was beleaguered by producer [[Michael Beinhorn]], who convinced Frusciante to play with an overly aggressive, heavy metal tone. Beinhorn asked Kiedis to write lyrics that were more musically viable and appealing; it thus caused the band to feel severely restricted and that their creative process was hampered.<ref name=vh1rhcp>Red Hot Chili Peppers; VH1's "Behind the Music". 2002.</ref><ref>Kiedis, 2004. pp. 240–4</ref> 

After switching to [[Warner Bros. Records]] when their contract with [[EMI]] expired in early 1990, the Chili Peppers chose [[Rick Rubin]] to produce their next record. The band sought an unorthodox location to record, and eventually decided upon a mansion formerly owned by magician Harry Houdini.<ref name=p.274>Kiedis, 2004. pp. 274-275</ref> They moved in for the duration of recording, without leaving once and it proved to be an greatly productive experience, allowing each member to concentrate a significant amount of time on their music composition.<ref name=p.274> When the time came to leave the location though, Frusciante had a difficult time adapting to outside life after being in near-seclusion for over thirty days.<ref>Kiedis, 2004. p. 280</ref> He began experimenting with heroin, steadily increasing as time progressed.<ref>Kiedis, 2004. p. 290</ref> ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' was released in 1991 and became a hit, selling seven million copies in the United States alone.<ref name=RIAA/> In 1992, less than a year after ''Blood Sugar'' was released, Frusciante quit the band during their Japanese leg of the tour.<ref name=vh1rhcp/><ref name=p295>Kiedis, 2004. p. 295</ref>

Stunned, the Chili Peppers had no plans as to who could replace Frusciante, hiring [[Arik Marshall]] to finish out the remaining dates after being forced to reschedule.<ref name=vh1rhcp/><ref name=pp298>Kiedis, 2004. pp. 298–304</ref> Upon returning to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], the band placed an ad in the ''L.A. Weekly'' for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time.<ref>Kiedis, 2004. p. 311</ref> After several months of unsuccessful attempts to locate the most suitable person who could bear fruit with the three other members, drummer [[Chad Smith]] suggested Dave Navarro. Navarro had always been their first choice, but had been too busy following the breakup of [[Jane's Addiction]]. Navarro was eventually given the position after several [[jam session|jam sessions]].<ref>Kiedis, 2004. p. 312</ref>

==Recording and production==
Kiedis knew that the band's sound would inevitably change the moment Navarro joined.<ref name=p313>Kiedis, 2004. p. 313</ref> In July of 1994, the band entered the studio to record the album. After completing the basic tracks, Kiedis began encountering trouble with lyrics. Several weeks prior he had a dental problem that required a mild anesthetic, and caused him to once again become dependent on drugs. Kiedis had thus slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he had sworn never to use again. The band took a short hiatus from recording to perform at Woodstock 94'. As the first show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, they played the first few songs in a metallic suit with large light bulbs fashioned as helmets.<ref name=p315323>Kiedis, 2004. p. 315-323</ref> 

After resuming production, Navarro questioned the methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures; he wondered why such a considerable amount of jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for much of the band.<ref>Kiedis, 2004. p. 328</ref> Months went by, and little came from it. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where they realized he had become an addict again. He returned to Hollywood in late January, when he finally finished recording his vocals; the rest of recording was completed later the next month.<ref>Kiedis, 2004. pp. 336-342</ref>

==Writing and composition==
Kiedis had recommence visceral drug use and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, therefore lyrics were written at a far slower rate.<ref name=p315323/> Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: "John had been a true anomaly when it came to [song writing]. He made it even easier than Hillel to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing you knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave."<ref name=p315323/> To compensate, Kiedis and Flea took several vacations together, in which entire songs were often conceived. 

Overall, ''One Hot Minute'' lyrically confronted the dark, melancholy, and remorseful feelings Kiedis confided within himself. Many of the songs were written a time when he was still hiding the resumed addiction.<ref name=p315323/> "Warped" directly faced Kiedis' distraught moods as a hysterical cry for help: "My tendency for dependency is offending me/It's upending me/I'm pretending to be strong and free from my dependency/It's warping me," and "A vacancy that's full of holes/Hold me, please, I'm feeling cold." He also felt disappointed that "no one had suspected that I had slipped from my more than five years of sobriety."<ref>Kiedis, 2004. p. 325</ref> The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state.<ref name=p315323/>

Although "Aeroplane", the album's first single, was more upbeat it still contained various references to Kiedis' issues: "I like pleasure spiked with pain" and "Looking into my own eyes/I can't find the love I want/Somebody'd better slap me before I start to rust, before I start to decompose." The song also featured Flea's daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse.<ref name=vh1rhcp/> "Tearjerker" was a direct tribute to [[Kurt Cobain]]. Kiedis felt the passing "was an emotional blow, and we all felt it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in a some weird way. For all of his screaming and all of his darkness, he was just loveable."

Flea contributed lyrics for the first time as Kiedis had become overwhelmed with his addiction and it hindered the creative output.<ref name=p341>Kiedis, 2004. pp. 341-344</ref><ref name=vh1rhcp/> Flea wrote the majority of "Transcending", and the intro to "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis' youth. He had even written an entire song, which he both sung and played on the record called "Pea". "My Friends" addressed more of Kiedis' own somber thoughts rather than those of "his friends":<ref name=p341/> "My friends are so depressed/I feel the question of your loneliness" and "My friends are so distressed/And standing on the brink of emptiness/No words I know of to express/This emptiness."

''One Hot Minute'' was characterized by significant use of heavy metal guitar riffs and hints of [[psychedelic rock]].<ref name=OHMAMG/> It was a significant divergence from previous Chili Peppers' records, especially ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' which incorporated drier guitar progressions and funkier bass lines. Although ''One Hot Minute'' took almost two years to write, record and produce it was not a smooth process. Navarro continuously believed as though he were an outsider to the reestablished members.<ref name=p315323/> His writing styles in Jane's Addiction were independent with other contributors, whereas the Red Hot Chili Peppers were far more of a collaborative group.<ref name=p315323/>

==Promotion and release==
While piecing together the final components of the album, the band recorded a video for "Warped". They asked Flea's brother in law, who had recorded ''[[Funky Monks]]'' for the band, to direct it. The video involved Kiedis and Navarro kissing towards the end as a way to break the monotony of cumbersome video recording. Thinking nothing of it, they continued to shoot and finished several days later.<ref name=p347>Kiedis, 2004. pp. 347-349</ref> Warner Bros., however, saw the video and instantly wanted it thrown away, considering it to be unmarketable and that the kiss would alienate a large portion of the band's fan base.<ref name=p347/> The band came to a consensus to let the kiss remain on the final cut, prompting a backlash from the college segment of their audience, who took offense at the action. Kiedis said of the situation: "If they couldn't accept what we were doing, we didn't need them anymore."<ref name=p347/> 

''One Hot Minute'' was released on September 12, 1995. It was certified gold just over two months later on [[November 11]]; since then it has gone two times multi-platinum in the United States.<ref name=RIAA/> The album peaked at #4 on the Billboard Top 200.<ref name=billboardohm>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=305&cfgn=Albums&cfn=The+Billboard+200&ci=3024177&cdi=7088024&cid=08%2F10%2F1996|title=''One Hot Minute'' album charting|accessdate=2007-09-22|publisher=Billboard}}</ref><ref name=amgsinglecharts>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:difrxqr5ldje~T51|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers' singles charts|accessdate=2007-09-22|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> "My Friends" peaked at #1 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks|Modern Rock]] and [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] charts.<ref name=ohmsingles>{{Cite web|url=http://wm10.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fpfwxq9hldfe~T31|title=''One Hot Minute'' singles|accessdate=2007-09-23|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> The song also peaked at #29 on the [[UK Top 40]] and "Aeroplane" at #11.<ref name=everyhit>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/|title=UK Top 40 charts|accessdate=2007-09-22|publisher=Everyhit}}</ref> Several days following the album's release, Kiedis continued to get high despite the numerous interviews he was scheduled to attend.<ref name=p347/>

==Critical reception==
''One Hot Minute'' was not as well received as ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' had been, and was generally considered to be a poor follow up. Some, however, praised the record. Daina Darzin of ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]'' said "''One Hot Minute'' dives into the emotionally deep end of drug addiction and loss," and that the album "is a ferociously eclectic and imaginative disc that also presents the band members as more thoughtful, spiritual – even grown-up. After a 10 plus-year career, they're realizing their potential at last."<ref name=rollingstonereview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/albums/album/202361/review/5940344/one_hot_minute|author=Darzin, Daina|date=[[October 5]], [[1995]]|title=''One Hot Minute'' review|accessdate=2007-09-22|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that "''One Hot Minute'' wails and flails like a mosh-pit workout tape, but it also has moments of outright subtlety and maturity." He goes on the praise Kiedis for "keeping his boorish tendencies under control." Browne, however, criticizes the band for "attempts at cosmic philosophy which often trip up on hippie-dippie sentiments," and some songs "fall back on tired frat-funk flop sweat."<ref name=ewreview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,298816,00.html|author=Browne, David|date=[[September 22]], [[1995]]|title=''One Hot Minute'' review|accessdate=2007-09-22|publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''}}</ref> All Music Guide's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that "following up Blood Sugar Sex Magik proved to be a difficult task for the Red Hot Chili Peppers," and "Navarro's metallic guitar shredding should have added some weight to the Chili Peppers' punk-inflected heavy-guitar funk, but tends to make it plodding." Erlewine continued to add that "by emphasizing the metal, the funk is gradually phased out of the blend, as is melody."<ref name=OHMAMG/> [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album a rating of "dud".<ref name=christgau>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1137|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers album reviews|publisher=Robert Christgau|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref>

"My Friends" was considered by Erlewine to be a "blatant attempt to hold on to the mainstream audience gained by "Under the Bridge," and that, in contrast, "the melodies are weak and the lyrics are even more feeble." The song also "tries to be a collective hug for all [Kiedis'] troubled pals."<ref name=OHMAMG/><ref name=ewreview/> ''Rolling Stone'', on the other hand, said the song was "lovely," and incorporates a "vaguely folky chorus, and sports the same sad wishfulness of "Under the Bridge" and "Breaking the Girl." The article went on to praise "Warped" claiming it "mixes harrowing lyrics with a multi-toned, layered intro and a whirling dervish of noises and big-rock rhythms surfing through and over big, funky hooks. It's like, well, a drug rush."<ref name=rollingstonereview/> ''Entertainment Weekly'' said "some of these songs last a little too long and could have benefited from a trimming," though credited Kiedis for sounding "nearly spiritual" on "Falling Into Grace".<ref name=ewreview/> The title track was "funky and fun. It's about love and sex. What the hell. Some things don't have to change."<ref name=rollingstonereview/>

==''One Hot Minute'' tour and Navarro's departure==
[[Image:Kiedis1996.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Anthony Kiedis during the ''One Hot Minute'' tour in 1996]]
The ''One Hot Minute'' tour began several days following the release of the album. The band opened with an introductory leg including part of Europe. Kiedis considered himself to be "lackluster, and as a musician, I was experiencing a slightly broken reed."<ref name=p350>Kiedis, 2004. pp.350-363</ref> The short European leg ended in early November, and the U.S. portion was scheduled to begin ten days later. It was, however, postponed until early February.<ref name=p350/> It began at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York. Several concerts in, while engaging in what he calls "eyes-closed robotic dancing," Kiedis tripped over his monitor and fell off the stage. He broke his foot and received a cast which he wore for the rest of the leg.<ref name=p350/> The band then traveled from the East coast to the West coast, and Kiedis thought it "was nice to see that people were still interested in coming out to see what we do," as there had been a four year gap since the release of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. After concluding the U.S. tour, the Chili Peppers took two weeks off before several Australia and New Zealand performances. Subsequently, the band was scheduled to complete touring in Europe after another two weeks off. During the hiatus, they played the first Tibetan Freedom Fest in San Francisco.<ref name=p350/> 

The Chili Peppers returned to Europe for a culmination leg; by then, Kiedis had remained sober the entire tour. Navarro, though, "wasn't crazy about playing music for the sake of music, and Flea needed that kind of bond," according to Kiedis. In Prague, he received an additional injury while attempting to execute a back flip. Plummeting off stage, he wore a back brace for the next few shows, immobilizing his actions to the confided location of his microphone. After shows in Paris and London to culminate the leg, the band returned home to L.A. Kiedis began taking drug once again, though consciously forcing himself to discontinue after several weeks.<ref name=p350/> The band was then invited to play in the North Pole for roughly 100 contest winners of a concert set up by Molson Beer, a Canadian beer company. The show was mildly motivating to the band and they returned home after two days.<ref name=p364>Kiedis, 2004. p. 364</ref> Nonetheless, months went by without any touring, as ''One Hot Minute'' hadn't sold nearly as well as ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref>Kiedis, 2004. p. 376</ref> Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis and the rest of the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Kiedis, however, got into a car accident while on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his visceral drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. He was, following discharge, forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months thus cancelling any scheduled concerts. Half way through recovery, the band was asked to play [[Fuji Rock Festival]] in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis' cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play.<ref>Kiedis, 2004. pp.280-282</ref>

Prior to the show, a large typhoon had been forecasted to hit the location of the festival. When the Chili Peppers got on stage, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obligated to an impromptu finish.<ref name=p384>Kiedis, 2004. pp. 384-390</ref><ref name=vh1rhcp/> Returning home, the Chili Peppers began parting ways and, for the most part, remained secluded from each other through the rest of the year. No new material was written.<ref name=p384/> It was not until later the next year that the band began rehearsal. Navarro, at this point, had also begun significant drug use while Kiedis struggled to remain sober. The band decided they would have a talk with Navarro and attempt to convince him to become abstemious once again. The discussion escalated into a heated dispute, and Navarro fell over an amplifier in apparition. By April 1998, nothing had been written and Flea and Kiedis decided it was time to fire Navarro. It proved to be a complicated circumstance, as Navarro became enraged at the reality: there was no band.<ref name=pp2>Kiedis, 2004. pp. 390-395</ref><ref name=vh1rhcp/> Flea himself was questioning the situation and thought it may be beneficial to call it quits: "The only way I could imagine carrying on is if we got John back in the band."<ref name=pp2/><ref name=vh1rhcp/>
