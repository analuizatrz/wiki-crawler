'''William McIntosh''' ([[1775]] &ndash; [[April 30]], [[1825]]), also known as White Warrior, was the son of [[Captain William McIntosh]], a member of a prominent [[Savannah, Georgia]] family sent into the Creek Nation to recruit them to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (Captain McIntosh's mother was a sister of [[Lachlan McGillivray]] of the [[Clan MacGillivray]] Chiefs Lineage). His mother, a [[Creek (people)|Creek]] named [[Senoya]] (also spelled Senoia), was a member of the prominent Wind Clan. Raised as an Indian, he never knew his [[Tory#American Revolution|Tory]] father. Because among the Creeks, descent was determined through one's mother; the fact that his father was white was of little importance. To put this more clearly, in the Muskogean mind McIntosh's father was not the one who begot him, but was in fact the eldest brother of his mother. McIntosh was a cousin of [[William Weatherford]] and Georgia Governor [[George Troup|George M. Troup]].

During the [[War of 1812]], a [[Creek War|civil war]] between the Upper and Lower Creeks broke out, and McIntosh was selected to head a kind of national police force established by [[Benjamin Hawkins]], an Indian agent, to deal with the nativistic Creek [[Red Sticks]]. He gained the enmity of (Alabama's) the Upper Creek Indians by leading General [[Andrew Jackson|Andrew Jackson's]] Indian troops during the [[Creek War|Creek Indian War]] of [[1813]] - [[1814]], during which the Upper Creeks were defeated. For his services at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] and elsewhere, he was commissioned a [[Brigadier General]] in the United States Army.

After the Creek Indian War, McIntosh built a plantation on the [[Chattahoochee River]] in [[Carroll County, Georgia|Carroll County]] called Lockchau Talofau (Acorn Bluff) that was worked by 72 slaves. (It is near [[Whitesburg, Georgia|Whitesburg]] and is today maintained as a park by Carroll County.)

In an [[1817]] letter written to President [[James Madison|Madison]] and signed by McIntosh, Madison was told that, while the more influential Cherokees of mixed blood wanted to swap their land, the "not so much civilized" pure bloods feared the mixed-bloods would&mdash;as they did&mdash;swap all their land, leaving them "without any land to walk on." The Creeks feared that these Cherokees might&mdash;as they already had&mdash;take land from the Creeks.

McIntosh also fought for the United States in the [[First Seminole War]]. He gained fame during this war by playing a major role in the capture of the so-called [[Fort Gadsden|Negro Fort]] located on the lower [[Apalachicola River|Apalachicola]]. (Georgia slaves escaped and took refuge with the Seminoles in Spanish-held [[Florida]].) The fort was occupied by about 300 black men, women, and children, 20 renegade Choctaws, and a few Seminole warriors. Its defenders were led by a black named Garcon. The downfall of the fort was brought about by an American cannon ball heated red hot setting off a tremendous explosion when it landed in the fort's magazine.

Despite the fact the Upper Creeks (including McIntosh) had vowed to kill anyone who signed away any more Indian land, McIntosh, along with eight other chiefs, on [[February 12]], [[1825]] signed the [[Treaty of Indian Springs]]; thus relinquishing all the Creeks' land in Georgia in exchange for $400,000. 

According to the fifth article of the treaty it stipulated, "That the treaty commissioners pay the first $200,000 directly to the McIntosh party."

Whether he signed the treaty for personal gain or because he believed signing it was in the best interests of the Creek Nation is still argued.

Despite Governor Troup's promise to protect him, just before daybreak on April 30th about 200 Creeks lead by [[Menawa]], one of the few Red Stick leaders who had survived the Creek War, set fire to McIntosh's plantation and executed him. After having been stabbed in the heart by the point of a long knife, shot an estimated 50 times, McIntosh was scalped and his body thrown in the river. If his enemies had waited much longer, McIntosh wouldn't have been there, as he was planning to leave that morning to look over land promised him along the [[Arkansas River]].
