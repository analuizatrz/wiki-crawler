'''''Homo floresiensis''''' ("Man of [[Flores]]", nicknamed '''[[Hobbit]]''') is the name for a possible [[species]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', remarkable for its small body, small [[brain]], and survival until relatively recent times.<ref name="Brown04">{{cite journal| author = Brown, P. | coauthors = Sutikna, T., Morwood, M.

To date, the only complete [[cranium]] is that of LB1.

==Discovery==
[[Image:Flores map.png|thumb|right|300px|{{legend|#FFFF00|Flores is the island highlighted in yellow. The territory of Indonesia as a whole is in green.|border=#000 solid 1px}}]]
The first specimens were discovered by a joint [[Australia]]n-[[Indonesia]]n team of [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] and [[archaeology|archaeologists]] looking on [[Flores]] for evidence of the original [[human migration]] of ''H. sapiens'' from [[Asia]] into [[Australia]].<ref name = "Brown04" /><ref name = "Morwood04" /> They were not expecting to find a new species, and were quite surprised at the recovery of the nearly complete skeleton of a hominid they dubbed LB1 (for the first skeleton recovered at the [[Liang Bua Cave]]).  Subsequent excavations recovered seven additional skeletons, dating from 38,000 to 13,000 years old, from Liang Bua [[limestone]] cave on Flores.<ref name = "Morwood05" />  An arm bone, provisionally assigned to ''H. floresiensis'', is about 74,000 years old. Also widely present in this cave are sophisticated stone implements of a size considered appropriate to the 1&nbsp;m tall human: these are at horizons from 95,000 to 13,000 years and are associated with juvenile ''[[Stegodon]]'', presumably the prey of LB1.<ref name = "Morwood05" />

The specimens are not [[fossil|fossilized]], but were described in a ''Nature'' news article as having "the consistency of wet [[blotting paper]]" (once exposed, the bones had to be left to dry before they could be dug up). Researchers hope to find preserved [[mitochondrial DNA]] to compare with samples from similarly unfossilised specimens of ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' and ''H. sapiens''. It is unlikely that useful DNA specimens exist in the available sample, as DNA degrades rapidly in warm [[tropical]] environments, sometimes in as little as a few dozen years.  Also, contamination from the surrounding environment seems highly possible given the moist environment in which the specimens were found.

== Anatomy ==
The most important and obvious identifying features of ''H. floresiensis'' are its small body and small cranial capacity.  Brown and Morwood also identified a number of additional, less obvious features, that might distinguish LB1 from modern ''H. sapiens'', including the form of the [[teeth]], the absence of a [[chin]], and the unusually low twist in the forearm bones.  Each of these putative distinguishing features has been heavily scrutinized by the scientific community, with different independent research groups reaching differing conclusions whether these features support the original designation of a new species,<ref name = "Argue06" /> or whether they identify LB1 as a severely pathological ''H. sapiens''.<ref name = "Jacob06" />  The discovery of additional partial skeletons<ref name = "Morwood05" /> has verified the existence of some features found in LB1, such as the lack of a chin, but Jacob and other research teams argue that these features do not distinguish LB1 from local ''H. sapiens'' morphology.<ref name = "Jacob06" />           

=== Small bodies ===
The [[holotype|type specimen]] for the proposed species is a fairly complete [[human skeleton|skeleton]] and near-complete [[skull]] proposed to be that of a 30-year-old [[female]] (LB1), nicknamed ''Little Lady of Flores'' or ''Flo'', about 1.06&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in) in height.<ref name = "Brown04" />  This short stature is also supported by the height estimates derived from the [[tibia]] of a second skeleton (LB8), on the basis of which Morwood and colleagues suggest that LB8 might have stood 1.09&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in) high.<ref name = "Morwood05" />  These estimates are outside the range of normal modern [[human height]] and is considerably shorter than the average adult height of even the physically smallest populations of modern humans, such as the African [[pygmy|Pygmies]] (< 1.5&nbsp;m, or 4&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in), [[Twa]], [[Semang]] (1.37&nbsp;m, or 4&nbsp;ft&nbsp;6 in for adult women), or [[Andamanese]] (1.37&nbsp;m, or 4&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in for adult women).  Mass is generally considered more [[biophysics|biophysically]] significant than a one-dimensional measure of length, and by that measure, due to effects of scaling, differences are even greater. LB1 has been estimated as perhaps about 25&nbsp;kg (55&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]).  This is smaller than not only modern ''H. sapiens'', but also than ''[[H. erectus]]'', which Brown and colleagues have suggested is the immediate ancestor of ''H. floresiensis''.  LB1 and LB8 are also somewhat smaller than the three million years older ancestor [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]]s, not previously thought to have expanded beyond [[Africa]].  Thus, LB1 and LB8 may be the shortest and smallest members of the extended human family discovered thus far. 

Despite the size difference, the specimens seem otherwise to resemble in their features ''H. erectus'', known to be living in [[Southeast Asia]] at times coinciding with earlier finds purported to be of ''H. floresiensis''.<ref name = "Morwood05" /> These [[homology (biology)|observed similarities]] form the basis for the establishment of the suggested [[cladistics|phylogenetic relationship]]. Despite a [[controversial]] reported finding by the same team of alleged material evidence, stone tools, of a ''H. erectus'' occupation 840,000 years ago, actual remains of ''H. erectus'' itself have not been found on Flores, much less [[Transitional fossil|transitional forms]].

To explain the small stature of ''H. floresiensis'', Brown and colleagues have suggested that in the limited food environment on Flores ''H. erectus'' underwent strong [[insular dwarfism]],<ref name ="Brown04" /> a form of [[speciation]] also seen on Flores in several species, including a dwarf ''[[Stegodon]]'' (a group of [[proboscidea]]ns that was widespread throughout Asia during the [[Quaternary]]), as well as being observed on other small islands. However, the "island dwarfing" theory has been subjected to some criticism from Teuku Jacob and colleagues<ref name = "Jacob06" /> who argue that LB1 is similar to local Rampasasa ''H. sapiens'' populations, and who point out that size can vary substantially in pygmy populations.

=== Small brains ===
[[Image:Floresiensis.jpg|thumb|right|The skull of ''H. floresiensis''.]]
In addition to a small body size, ''H. floresiensis'' had a remarkably small [[human brain|brain]].  The type specimen, at 380&nbsp;cm³ (23&nbsp;[[cubic inch|in³]]), is at the lower range of [[chimpanzee]]s or the ancient australopithecines.<ref name = "Brown04" /><ref name = "Falk05" />  The brain is reduced considerably relative to this species' presumed immediate ancestor ''H. erectus'', which at 980&nbsp;cm³ (60&nbsp;in³) had more than double the brain volume of its descendant species.<ref name = "Falk05" /> Nonetheless, the estimated [[brain to body mass ratio]] of LB1 lies between that of ''Homo erectus'' and the great apes.<ref name = "Falk06a">{{cite journal| author = Falk, D. | coauthors = Hildebolt, C., Smith, K., Morwood, M.J., Sutikna, T., Jatmiko, Wayhu Saptomo, E., Brunsden, B. & Prior, F. | date = May 19, 2006 |title = Response to Comment on "The Brain of LB1, ''Homo floresiensis''"|journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 312 | pages = 999c | doi = 10.1126/science.1124972}}</ref>

Indeed, the discoverers have associated ''H. floresiensis'' with [[human behavior|advanced behavior]]s. There is evidence of the use of fire for cooking in Liang Bua cave, and evidence of cut marks on the ''Stegodon'' bones associated with the finds.<ref name = "Morwood04" /><ref name = "Morwood05" /> The species has also been associated with [[stone tool]]s of the sophisticated [[Upper Paleolithic]] tradition typically associated with modern humans, who at 1310&ndash;1475&nbsp;cm³ (80&ndash;90&nbsp;in³) nearly quadruple the brain volume of ''H. floresiensis'' (with body mass increased by a factor of 2.6).  Some of these tools were apparently used in the necessarily [[co-operation|cooperative]] [[hunting]] of local dwarf ''Stegodon'' by this small human species.<ref name = "Morwood05" /> 

An indicator of intelligence is the size of region 10 of the dorsomedial [[prefrontal cortex]], which is associated with [[self-awareness]] and is about the same size as that of modern humans, despite the much smaller overall size of the brain.<ref name = "Falk05" />

===Additional features===
Additional features used to argue that the finds come from a population of previously unidentified hominins include the absence of a chin, the relatively low twist of the arm bones, and the width of the leg bones relative to their length.<ref name = "Brown04" /><ref name = "Morwood04" /><ref name = "Morwood05" />  The presence of each of these features has been confirmed by independent investigators<ref name = "Jacob06" /> but their significance has been disputed.  For example, Jacob and colleagues argue that each of these unusual features indicates some form of pathology in the LB1 skeleton.

In September of 2007, Matthew W. Tocheri, of the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]], announced that ''Homo floresiensis'' was indeed a separate branch on the human evolutionary chain. He and his team found the bones in the ''Homo floresiensis'' wrist to be "indistinguishable from an African ape or early hominin-like wrist and nothing at all like that seen in modern humans and Neanderthals". He goes on to explain how while there are pathologies that can affect the wrist, there are none that can effectively turn a modern human wrist into that of an extinct proto-human or a modern day African ape. Once confirmed, this would mean that Neanderthal was not the last homo species to share this planet with ''Homo sapiens'', as ''Homo floresiensis'' only died out around 18,000 years ago, or 12,000 years after the last ''Homo neanderthalensis''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://http://news.aol.com/story/_a/scientists-hobbit-wasnt-a-modern-human/n20070920161809990016 |title=Scientists: Hobbit Wasn't a Modern Human |accessmonthday= September 21|accessyear=2007 |author= Randolph E.

Tocheri of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.  }}</ref>

== Recent survival ==
The species is thought to have survived on Flores until at least as recently as 12,000 years ago making it the longest-lasting non-modern human, surviving long past the [[Neandertal|Neanderthals]] (''H. neanderthalensis'') which became [[Extinction|extinct]] about 24,000 years ago.<ref name=Morwood05/>

Flores remained isolated during the Wisconsin glaciation (the [[last glacial period|most recent glacial period]]), despite the low [[sea level rise|sea level]]s that united much of the rest of [[Sundaland]], because of a deep neighboring [[strait]]. This has led the discoverers of ''H. floresiensis'' to conclude that the species or its ancestors could only have reached the isolated island by [[ship transport|water transport]], perhaps arriving in [[bamboo]] [[raft]]s around 100,000 years ago (or, if they are ''H. erectus'', then about 1 million years ago).  This perceived evidence of advanced technology and cooperation on a modern human level has prompted the discoverers to [[hypothesis|hypothesize]] that ''H. floresiensis'' almost certainly had [[language]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041028144857.htm |title=Skeleton reveals lost world of 'Little people' |accessmonthday= October 21|accessyear=2006 |author= |date=October 28, 2004 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |quote=We also believe that their ancestors may have reached the island using bamboo rafts. The clear implication is that, despite tiny brains, these little humans were intelligent and almost certainly had language. }}</ref> These suggestions have been some of the most controversial of the discoverers' findings, despite the probable high intelligence of ''H. floresiensis''.

Local [[geology]] suggests that a [[volcano|volcanic eruption]] on Flores was responsible for the demise of ''H. floresiensis'' in the part of the island under study at approximately 12,000 years ago, along with other local [[fauna]], including the dwarf [[elephant]] ''[[Stegodon]]''.<ref name=Morwood04/> The discoverers suspect, however, that this species may have survived longer in other parts of Flores to become the source of the ''[[Ebu Gogo]]'' stories told among the local people. The ''Ebu Gogo'' are said to have been small, hairy, language-poor cave dwellers on the scale of ''H. floresiensis''. Widely believed to be present at the time of the arrival of the first Portuguese ships during the 16th century, these strange creatures were apparently last spotted as recently as the late 19th century.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/28/whuman228.xml | title = Villagers speak of the small, hairy Ebu Gogo | publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|date=2004-10-28|accessdate=15 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref><!--Can this source be considered reliable?--> 

Similarly, on the island of [[Sumatra]], there are reports of a 1–1.5&nbsp;m tall humanoid, the ''[[Orang Pendek]]'', which a few professional scholars, such as Debbie Martyr and Jeremy Holden, take seriously.<ref>{{cite web | title=Explorers find 'perfect' yeti tracks|publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2001-10-30 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1628878.stm | accessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref> Footprints and hairs believed to be from the ''Orang Pendek'' have been recovered by two amateur explorers.<ref>{{cite news |author=David Green |title=Evidence of 'jungle yeti' found |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3734946.stm |format= |work= | publisher=BBC News Online |pages= |page= | date= | accessdate=2006-10-18}}

The evidence for the Orang Pendek thus far is that of modern Homo sapiens. Scholars working on the Flores Man have noted that the ''Orang Pendek'' may also be surviving modern Flores men still living on Sumatra.

== Controversies ==
Whether the specimens represent a new species is a controversial issue within the scientific community. Professor [[Teuku Jacob]], chief [[paleontologist]] of the Indonesian [[Gadjah Mada University]] and other [[scientist]]s reportedly disagree with the placement of the new finds into a new species of ''Homo'', stating instead, "It is a [[sub-species]] of ''Homo sapiens'' classified under the [[Australoid|Austrolomelanesid]] race". He contends that the find is from a 25–30 year-old [[omnivore|omnivorous]] subspecies of ''H. sapiens'', and not a 30-year-old female of a new species. He is convinced that the small skull is that of a mentally defective modern human, probably a Pygmy, suffering from the [[genetic disorder]] [[microcephaly]], which produces a small brain and skull.

In early December 2004, Professor Jacob removed most of the remains from Soejono's institution, [[Jakarta]]'s National Research Centre of Archaeology, for his own research without the permission of the Centre's directors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3471304 | title=Homo floresiensis | Skulduggery | Economist.com | accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=82&ObjectID=8500998 | title=Hobbit woman' remains spark row among academics - 30 Nov 2004 - Science | accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg18424772.900 | title=Fight over access to 'hobbit' bones - being-human - 11 December 2004 - New Scientist | accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1386423,00.html | title=Professor fuels row over Hobbit man fossils - World - Times Online|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> Some expressed fears that, like the [[Dead Sea scrolls|Dead Sea Scrolls]], important scientific evidence would be sequestered by a small group of scientists who neither allowed access by other scientists nor published their own research. Jacob eventually returned the remains with portions severely damaged<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/news/Science/Hobbits-triumph-tempered-by-tragedy/2005/03/04/1109700677461.html</ref> and missing two leg bones on [[23 February]], [[2005]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/news/20050228/01/ | title=The Scientist : Flores hominid bones returned | accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> to the worldwide consternation of his peers.  Reports noted the condition of the returned remains; "(including) long, deep cuts marking the lower edge of the Hobbit's jaw on both sides, said to be caused by a knife used to cut away the rubber mould"; "the chin of a second Hobbit jaw was snapped off and glued back together. Whoever was responsible misaligned the pieces and put them at an incorrect angle"; and, "The pelvis was smashed, destroying details that reveal body shape, gait and evolutionary history"<ref name="bbc-restart">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6294101.stm | title=BBC News, Science/Nature: Hobbit cave digs set to restart | accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> and causing the discovery team leader Professor Morwood to remark "It's sickening, Jacob was greedy and acted totally irresponsibly."<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/news/Science/Hobbits-triumph-tempered-by-tragedy/2005/03/04/1109700677461.html</ref>  Jacob, however, denied any wrongdoing.  He stated that such damages occurred during transport from Yogyakarta back to Jakarta<ref name="bbc-restart"/> despite the physical evidence to the contrary that the jawbone had been broken  while making a mold of the hobbit, and when trying to repair it "rammed the two halves together at the wrong angle, stuck bone fragments in the cracks, and hidden the mess with a thick coating of glue".<ref><http://www.smh.com.au/news/Science/Hobbits-triumph-tempered-by-tragedy/2005/03/04/1109700677461.html</ref>

However, prior to Professor Jacob's heist, a CT scan was taken of the skull and in 2005, a computer-generated model of the skull of Homo floresiensis was undertaken, and analysed by a team headed by [[Dean Falk]] of [[Florida State University]]. The results were published in ''Science'' in Feb. 2005. The authors of the study claimed that brainpan was not that of a pygmy nor an individual with a malformed skull and brain, supporting the view that it is a new species.<ref name="Falk05" /> However, in October 2005 ''Science'' published an additional study headed by Alfred Czarnetzki, Carsten M. Pusch and Jochen Weber. This disagreed with the findings of the February 2005 study and concluded that the skull of LB1 is consistent with microcephaly.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/310/5746/236b | title=Technical Comments: Comment on "The Brain of LB1, Homo floresiensis" | accessdate=2007-03-28 | publisher=''Science'' | date=2005-10-14}}</ref> 

The results of the Feb. 2005 study were also questioned in the [[May 19]], [[2006]], issue of the journal ''Science'', in which Robert D. Martin of the Field Museum in Chicago and co-authors argued that the 2005 study had not compared the skull with a typical example of adult microcephaly. Martin and his co-authors concluded that the skull was probably microcephalic. Martin argued that the brain is far too small to be a separate dwarf species; if it were, he wrote, the 400-cubic-centimeter brain would indicate a creature only one foot in height, which would be one-third the size of the discovered skeleton.<ref name=Times20May2006>"'Hobbit' Bones Said to Be of Deformed Human".

In response, Brown and Morwood have criticized these recent findings by claiming that the scientists came to incorrect conclusions about bone and skull structure and mistakenly attributed the height of ''Homo floresiensis'' to microcephaly.<ref name=NYTimes21August2006>{{cite news | title = Report Reignites Feud Over ‘Little People’ as Separate Species | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/science/21cnd-tiny.html | publisher = [[The New York Times]]|date = [[2006-08-21]] | accessdate = 2006-08-21}}</ref> They also pointed to studies by other scientists who rejected the argument that the individual was diseased. Falk's team replied to the critics of their Feb. 2005 study, standing by their results and insisting that the skull is very different from microcephalic specimens.<ref name = "Falk06a" /> Bill Jungers, a morphologist from [[Stony Brook University]], examined the skull and concluded that the skeleton displays "no trace of disease". However, Jochen Weber of the Leopoldina Hospital in Schweinfurt argues that "we can't rule out the possibility that he suffered from microcephaly."<ref>[http://www.accuca.conectia.es/noticias/2006/a_huge_fight_over_a_little_man.htm A Huge Fight over a Little Man, by Rafaela von Bredow, ''Der Spiegel'', September 1, 2006.]</ref> Debbie Argue of the [[Australian National University]] has also published a study in the ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'' which rejects microcephaly and concludes that the finds are indeed a new species.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-07-16-hobbit-argument_x.htm USA Today: The hullabaloo about hobbits]</ref> 

===Evidence against microcephaly===
On January 29, 2007, Falk published a new study supporting the claim to species status <ref>[http://www.fsu.edu/news/2007/01/29/brain.analysis/ FSU anthropologist's brain analysis confirms ancient 'Hobbit' a separate species] Jan 29, 2007</ref> offering the most conclusive evidence to date that the claims of a microcephalic ''Homo sapiens'' were not credible.  In this new study Falk examines 3-D computer generated models of an additional 9 microcephalic brains and 10 normal human brains, revealing the Floresiensis skulls having shape more aligned with normal human brains, but also having unique features which is consistent with what one would expect in a new species.  Comparing the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the portion in the back of the skull revealed a brain highly developed, completely unlike the microcephalic brain, and advanced in ways different from human brains.<ref>January 29 issue of the journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States]]''</ref> This finding also answered past criticisms that the floresiensis brain was simply too small to be capable of the intelligence required to create the tools found in their proximity.  Falk concludes the onus is now upon the critics that continue to claim microcephaly to produce a brain of a microcephalic that bears resemblance to the floresiensis brain.

===Laron syndrome===
On [[June 27]], [[2007]], Hershkovitz et al. published a new paper arguing that the morphological features of  Floresiensis are essentially indistinguishable from those of [[Laron syndrome]], casting the species claim once more into doubt<ref>[http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/hershkovitz_laron_syndrome_2007.html Another diagnosis for a hobbit] July 3, 2007</ref><ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.20655 Comparative skeletal features between Homo floresiensis and patients with primary growth hormone insensitivity (Laron syndrome)] 17 April 2007</ref>. 

===Wrist bone structure===
On [[September 22]], [[2007]] it was reported that Matthew W. Tocheri of the Smithsonian's National Museum observed bones within the wrist of ''H. floresiensis'' which appear entirely different from those seen in modern humans and are basically indistinguishable from an African ape or early hominin-like wrist bone structure.  This indicates that ''Homo floresiensis'' may in fact be an early hominin and not a modern human with a physical disorder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070920/ap_on_sc/hobbit_wrist |title=Scientists: Hobbit wasn't a modern human |date=[[2007-09-20]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.aol.com/story/_a/study-says-hobbit-not-a-modern-human/20070921215709990001 |title=AP News, Study Says 'Hobbit' Not a Modern Human |accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12667-hobbit-wrist-bones-suggests-a-distinct-species.html |title=New Scientist: 'Hobbit' wrist bones suggest a distinct species |accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/09/20/hobbit_arc.html?category=archaeology&guid=20070920160030&dcitc=w19-502-ak-0000| title=Discovery Channel News: The Hobbit: Not Human? |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>
