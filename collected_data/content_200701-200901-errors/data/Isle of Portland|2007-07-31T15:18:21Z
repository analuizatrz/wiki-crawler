The '''Isle of Portland''' is a {{convert|4|mi|km|0|lk=on|sing=on|mos=on}}  long by {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1|sing=on}} wide [[limestone]] island in the [[English Channel]]. The isle is {{convert|5|mi|km|0|mos=on}} south of the resort of [[Weymouth]], forming the southernmost point of the [[counties of England|county]] of [[Dorset]], in [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. The island is connected to the mainland by a large pebble [[tombolo]], [[Chesil Beach]], and by the [[A354 road]] bridge to Weymouth. Portland had a population of 12,710 in 2005, and is part of the borough of [[Weymouth and Portland]].

The island is a central part of the [[Jurassic Coast]] World Heritage Site, a {{convert|95|mi|km|0|sing=on}} long stretch of the Dorset and east Devon coast, important for its varied geology and landforms.  The island's name is used for one of the [[British Sea Areas]], and has been [[Portland|exported]] as the name of several North American cities and Australian towns.  High quality [[Portland limestone]], still quarried here, has been used extensively in British architecture, including [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and the [[United Nations Building]].

Portland is notable for its large, deep artificial [[Portland Harbour|harbour]] which was an important [[Royal Navy]] base during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and a key Royal Navy and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]] training base until the 1990s, and is now a small civilian port and popular recreation area.  England's [[National Sailing Academy]] is situated in the harbour and will host the sailing events for the [[2012 Olympic Games]].

==History==
[[Image:Porland island map1937.jpg|thumb|220px|image|left|A map of the Isle of Portland from 1937]]
Portland has been inhabited since at least the [[Mesolithic]] period (the Middle [[Stone Age]]) - there is [[archaeological]] evidence of Mesolithic inhabitants near [[Portland Bill]],<ref name="mesolithic">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2002 | url = http://www.gallica.co.uk/celts/portland.htm | title =  Mesolithic Site, Portland | format = | work = | publisher = Association for Portland Archaeology | accessdate = 2007-07-30}}</ref> and there is evidence of inhabitation of the island in ages since.

The Crown opened many of the [[quarry|quarries]] which made Portland famous.  After the [[Great Fire of London]], Sir [[Christopher Wren]], the notable architect and [[Member of Parliament]] for nearby Weymouth, used six million tons of white [[Portland limestone]] to rebuild much of London, and some well-known buildings in the capital, including [[St Paul's Cathedral]]<ref name="st paul's">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.stpauls.co.uk/page.aspx?theLang=001lngdef&pointerid=32207NnDnfjeCGJ1g2bvy1Jt3FI0gUAP | title =  1710 - Construction is Completed | format = | work = | publisher = Dean and Chapter St Paul's | accessdate = 2007-04-03}}</ref> and the eastern front of [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref name="buckinghampalace">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page568.asp | title =  Buckingham Palace History | format = | work = | publisher = HM Queen Elizabeth II | accessdate = 2007-04-03}}</ref>.

Since the early 19th Century, Portland has had a number of railway [[branch line]]s. The Merchant's Railway was the earliest, opening in 1826 (one year after the [[Stockton and Darlington railway]]), and ran from the quarries at the north end of the Island to the docks in [[Castletown, Dorset|Castletown]], where Portland stone was shipped around the country.<ref name="railways">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://www.johnrnew.demon.co.uk/weyrails.htm | title =  Railways of the Weymouth area | format = | work = | publisher = Island Publishing | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The [[Portland Branch Railway|Weymouth and Portland Railway]] was constructed in 1865, and ran from a [[train station|station]] in [[Melcombe Regis]], across the Fleet and along Chesil Beach to a station in Victoria Square in [[Chiswell]].<ref name="railways2">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=351 | title =  Weymouth to Portland Railway, Construction and growth | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The line continued as the Easton and Church Hope Railway, which circled the island through Castletown and ascended the cliffs at East Weares, to loop back north to a station in [[Easton, Dorset|Easton]].<ref name="railways" /> The line closed to passengers in March 1965, with the final goods train running in April that year.<ref name="railways2" />

[[Image:Chesil Cove.JPG|left|thumb|Chesil Beach protects Chiswell from flooding]]
For many centuries coastal [[flooding]] has affected Chiswell; the village lies below [[sea level]] next to [[Chesil Cove|the terminus]] of Chesil Beach. In autumn and winter Chesil Beach is subject to severe [[storm]]s and massive waves, which have a very long [[fetch (geography)|fetch]] across the entire [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name="flooding">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.swgfl.org.uk/jurassic/chis10.htm | title =  Chiswell case study: The Scheme | format = | work = | publisher = Jurassic Coast | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> Following two severe flood events in the 1970s, [[Weymouth and Portland]] Borough Council and [[Wessex Water]] decided to investigate the structure of the beach, and possible [[coastal management]] schemes that could be constructed there to protect Chiswell. In the 1980s it was agreed that a scheme to protect against a [[return period|one-in-five year]] storm would be practicable, which would also reduce flood depth and duration for more severe storms.<ref name="flooding" /> As part of this scheme, several [[Coastal defence#Hard construction techniques|hard engineering]] techniques were employed, including a {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0|sing=on}} [[gabion]] beach crest to the north of Chiswell, an extended [[sea wall]] next to the village itself, and a [[culvert]] running from inside the beach, underneath Portland Beach Road and into [[Portland Harbour]], to divert flood water away from low lying areas.<ref name="flooding" />

[[Rabbit]]s have been associated with [[bad luck]] for centuries on Portland, and as such use of the name is still [[taboo]], with the creatures often being referred to as "Underground Mutton", "Long-Eared Furry Things" or just "bunnies".<ref name="wallaceandgromit">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/4318710.stm  | title = Wallace and Gromit spook island | format = | work = | publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The fear of the word rabbit is popularly believed to derive from workers in the island's quarries, as they would often see rabbits emerging from their [[burrow]]s immediately before a rock fall; the rabbits' burrowing was often blamed for increasing the risk of such dangerous (and sometimes deadly) [[landslide]]s.<ref name="rabbits" /> There have been several instances of cave-ins, and in one instance a [[crane (machine)|crane]] operator died when his crane toppled on weak ground above rabbit burrows. In past times when the quarrying was done by hand, if a rabbit was seen in the area, the quarry man would pack up and go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured.<ref name="wallaceandgromit" /> Even today many older Portland residents will be offended or go quiet at the mention of the word rabbit.<ref name="rabbits">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=784  | title = Rabbits, the Portland taboo word | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref>

This [[superstition]] came to national attention in October 2005 when a special batch of [[movie poster|advertisement posters]] were made for the [[Wallace and Gromit]] film, [[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit|The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]. In respect of local beliefs the flim promoters omitted the word 'rabbit' and replaced the film's title with the phrase, ''"Something bunny is going on"''.<ref name="wallaceandgromit" />

==Politics and demographics==
[[Image:DorsetWeymouthPortland.png|thumb|right|Weymouth and Portland shown within Dorset]]
The island is an ancient [[Royal Manor]], and until the [[19th century]] remained a separate [[Liberty (division)|liberty]] within the county for administrative purposes. The entire Isle constituted a single [[urban district]] from 1894 to 1974, when it became part of the [[borough]] of [[Weymouth and Portland]]. Weymouth and Portland was formed on April 1 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], and was a merger between the nearby borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and the Portland urban district. 

The [[Mayor]] of Weymouth and Portland is David Harris ([[Liberal Democrats|Lib Dem]]), with Tim Munro ([[Independent politician#United Kingdom|Independent]]) as Deputy Mayor Mayor of Portland Town Council.<ref name="weymouthcouncillors">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/Council/Councillors/home.asp?svid=586 | title = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council - councillors | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> Weymouth and Portland and [[Purbeck]] [[district]]s are in the [[Dorset South]] parliamentary [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]], created in 1885.

In 2005 Portland's population was 12,710; the island's population has remained between twelve and thirteen thousand since the 1970s. In 2005 there were 5,390 dwellings on the entire island. Portland has an area of 1150 [[hectare]]s, giving an approximate [[population density]] of 11 residents per hectare.<ref name="dorsetforyou" /> The population is almost entirely of native English origin, with 96.8% of residents being of White [[Briton|British]] background.<ref name="dorsetforyou" /> Portland house prices are lower than in Weymouth, but still relatively high by UK standards, and around average for most of the south of England. The average price of a [[detached house]] in 2005 was £215,196, with an average [[terraced house]] costing £149,825.<ref name="dorsetforyou" />

The island’s crime rates are below that of nearby Weymouth, and the [[United Kingdom]] average – with 8.7 burglaries per 1000 people in 2004 and 2005. The equivalent rate in Weymouth is 13.4 per 1000, which is slightly higher than that of [[South West England]] (10.7 per 1000) but lower than the [[England and Wales]] average of 14.4 per 1000. The island's unemployment rate is also very low, at 1.1% of the economically active population in 2005.<ref name="dorsetforyou" />

==Geography, geology and ecology==
[[Image:Dorset_geology.png|thumb|260px|The Isle of Portland lies on Upper [[Oolite]] [[limestone]]]]
The Isle of Portland lies in the [[English Channel]], {{convert|2|km|mi|1|mos=on}} offshore to the south of the resort of [[Weymouth]], forming the southernmost point in [[Dorset]]. Portland is unusual in that it is connected to the mainland near the village of [[Abbotsbury]] by [[Chesil Beach]], an {{convert|18|mi|km|0|sing=on}} long [[tombolo]]. Portland is therefore often incorrectly defined as a [[peninsula]] or a tombolo - it is technically a 'tied' [[island]], while Chesil Beach is its tombolo.<ref name="tombolo">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.vnc.qld.edu.au/enviro/flinders/land-defns.htm | title = Coastal Landform Definitions | format = | work = | publisher = Villanova College | accessdate = 2007-07-29}}</ref>

Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas; the steeply-sloping area of land at the north end of the island called [[Underhill, Dorset|Underhill]], and the larger, gently sloping area of land to the to the south, called [[Tophill]]. Underlying Tophill is a vast area of [[Portland stone]], declining at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of {{convert|151|m|ft|0|lk=on}} near [[Verne (HM Prison)|the Verne]] in the north, to just above sea level at [[Portland Bill]].<ref name="geology">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/portnew.htm#cross | title = General Geology | format = | work = | publisher = Southampton University | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> (Portland Bill should not be confused with the Isle of Portland. Portland Bill is a narrow [[promontory]] (or [[bill]]) of [[Portland stone]] which forms the most southerly part of Tophill.)

The underlying rocks of Underhill are in contrast with that of Tophill; Portland Stone is only found near summit of Portland, whilst the majority of Underhill lies on a steep [[escarpment]] composed of a layer of Portland [[Sand]], lying above a thicker layer of [[Kimmeridge Clay]], which also underlies Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour. It is this layer of Kimmeridge Clay which has resulted in a series of [[landslide]]s around this area, forming what is now known as West Weares and East Weares.<ref name="geology" /> 

[[Image:Terraced houses at fortuneswell.jpg|left|thumb|[[Terraced house|Terraced]] Portland Stone houses in Fortuneswell, Underhill]]
The island of Portland comprises several distinct settlements, the largest being [[Fortuneswell]] in Underhill and [[Easton, Dorset|Easton]] in Tophill.  The other villages in Underhill are [[Castletown, Dorset|Castletown]] and [[Chiswell]], and [[Weston, Dorset|Weston]], [[Southwell, Dorset|Southwell]], [[Wakeham]] and [[the Grove]] occupy Tophill.

The vast majority of houses and buildings on the island are built out of [[Portland Stone]] blocks, and as a consequence, most Portland houses have a similar style and layout, and have thick (30-60cm) walls, which were governed by the culture and living standards at the time in which they were built. Some houses have been painted, whilst most retain the yellow-grey colour of the stone, giving the Island a unique character.

Portland Bill has three [[lighthouse]]s; it is an important way point for coastal traffic passing the obstacle caused by the island and its [[tidal race]].  The most modern lighthouse was refurbished in 1996, and is now entirely computer controlled; a visitor centre with information and guided tours of the lighthouse and its history was built nearby.<ref name="lighthouse">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/portland_bill.html | title = Portland Bill Lighthouse | format = | work = | publisher = Trinity House | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref>  Two earlier lighthouses stand slightly further inland, one of which is now an important bird observatory used by [[ornithology|ornithologists]], providing a long term record of bird migration, and accommodation for visiting birdwatchers.<ref name="lighthouse" /><ref name="wildlife">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=546 | title = Portland wildlife | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref>

[[Image:Portland Bill Lighthouse 2.jpg|thumb|right|Portland Bill lighthouse and Visitor's Centre]] 
The tidal race to the south of Portland Bill is caused by Portland Ledge (the Shambles), a {{convert|10|m|ft|0|sing=on|lk=on}} deep, {{convert|1.3|nmi|km|0|sing=on|lk=on}} long underwater extension of Portland Stone into the [[English Channel]] at a place where the general depth of Channel is usually {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} to {{convert|40|m|ft|0}}.<ref name="shambles">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/portnew.htm#offshore | title = Offshore Geology | format = | work = | publisher = Southampton University | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The strong current only ceases for brief periods during the twelve and half hour tidal cycle and can reach {{convert|7|knot|m:s|0|lk=on|mos=on}} at the spring tide of around {{convert|2|m|ft|0|mos=on}}.<ref name="shambles" />

Due to its coastal location and isolation, the Isle of Portland has an extensive range of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], some unique in the [[British Isles]]; most of Portland's coastline and quarries are designated as [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref name="wildlife" /> Different sea birds and migratory birds occupy the island in different seasons, sometimes these include extremely rare species which are a draw for [[ornithologist]]s from around the country.<ref name="fauna" /> Rare visitors to the seas around Portland include [[dolphin]]s, [[seal]]s and [[basking shark]]s.<ref name="wildlife" /> Chesil Beach is one of only two sites in Britain in which the Scaly Cricket can be found - unlike any other [[cricket]], it is wingless and does not sing or hop.<ref name="fauna">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=542 | title = Chesil Beach | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref>

Portland's comparatively warm and sunny climate allows many species of plants to thrive on the island, which do not on the mainland. The island's limestone soil has low [[nutrient]] levels; hence many smaller species of [[wild flower]]s and [[grass]]es are able to grow in the absence of larger species.<ref name="wildlife" /> On top of the higher sea cliffs in the north, Portland Sea [[Lavender]] can be found - unique to Portland it is one of the [[United Kingdom]]'s rarest plants.<ref name="flora">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=543 | title = Coastal Flora & Fauna | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> The large number of wild flower and plant species make Portland an excellent [[habitat]] for [[butterflies]]; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on the island. Some varieties migrate from mainland [[Europe]]; many of these species are rare in the United Kingdom, including the unique Silver Studded Blue.<ref name="butterflies">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=541 | title = Portland Butterflies | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref>

==Climate==
As Portland is surrounded by the mild seas of the south west of England, the island has a [[temperate]] climate ([[Koppen climate classification#GROUP C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|Koppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures. The average annual mean temperature on the island from years 1971 to 2000 was 10.2 to 12&nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]].<ref name="metofficemaps" /> The warmest month is July, with a maximum average [[temperature range]] of 12&nbsp;°C to 21.7&nbsp;°C, whilst the coolest month is February, with a maximum average temperature range of 1.9&nbsp;°C to 9.9&nbsp;°C.<ref name="metofficemaps">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2000 | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/mapped.html | title = Met Office UK climate maps 1971–2000 | format = | work = | publisher = the [[Met Office]] | accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref>

The borough of Weymouth and Portland, along with the rest of the South Coast, often has the sunniest weather in Britain.<ref name="metofficeengland">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://www.met-office.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/england/index.html | title = Met Office England's climate | format = | work = | publisher = the Met Office | accessdate = 2006-11-06}}</ref> Weymouth and Portland averaged 1768.4 [[hour]]s of sunshine annually between the years 1971 and 2000, which is just under 40% of the maximum possible.<ref name="annualweather" /><ref>The maximum hours of sunshine possible in one year is approximately 4476 hours.</ref> December is the cloudiest month, with an average of 55.7 hours of sunshine, whilst July is the sunniest month, averaging 235.1 hours.<ref name="annualweather">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=1015 | title = Annual weather summary | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-05-21}}</ref> December is also the wettest month, with an average of 90&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] of rainfall, and July is also the driest month, averaging 35&nbsp;mm of rain.<ref name="annualweather" /> Weymouth and Portland's average annual rainfall is below the England average at 743&nbsp;mm.<ref name="englandclimate" /> Portland is far enough east to be less affected by the Atlantic storms that [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] experience.

The mild seas that surround Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 8 times a year.<ref name="portlandtemperature">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://www.geoffkirby.freeserve.co.uk/Weather/Temperature/ | title = Temperature and Frost | format = | work = | publisher = Geoff Kirby | accessdate = 2006-11-18}}</ref> Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average 0 to 6 days a year.<ref name="metofficesnow">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2000 | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/dl/17.gif | title = Met Office UK snow lying days | format = | work = | publisher = the Met Office | accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref> Almost all winters have one day or less with snow lying; it may snow or [[sleet]] a couple of times in a winter, yet it almost never settles on the ground.

== Sport and Recreation ==
[[Image:uk dor portharbour.JPG|thumb|left|Fortuneswell and [[Portland Harbour]], seen from The Verne.  The [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]] is on the left.]]
In 2000, the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]] was constructed in Osprey Quay on the northern tip of Portland as a centre for sailing in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Weymouth Bay|Weymouth and Portland's waters]] have  been credited by the Royal Yachting Association as amongst the best in Northern [[Europe]].<ref name="wpnsa">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/London2012/home.asp?svid=14 | title = 2012 Olympic Games sailing venue | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref> Weymouth and Portland regularly host local, national and international sailing events in its waters. These events include the J/24 World Championships in 2005, staging trials for the 2004 Athens Olympics, the ISAF World Championship 2006, the BUSA Fleet Racing Championships, and the RYA Youth National Championships.<ref name="wpnsaevents">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.wpnsa.org.uk/pressreleases.htm | title = WPNSA - press releases | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref>

In 2005, the WPNSA was selected to host sailing events at the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games|2012 Olympic Games]]. The main reason that the island was chosen to host these events was the fact that the Sailing Academy had only recently been built, so no new venue would need to be provided. However, as part of the [[South West of England Regional Development Agency]]'s plans to redevelop Osprey Quay, in which the Academy is built, a new 600 berth marina and an extension with more on-site facilities will be built.<ref name="portlandmarina">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.portlandmarina.co.uk | title = Dean and Reddyhoff Marina | format = | work = | publisher = Dean and Reddyhoff Limited | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref> With construction commencing in August 2007 and finishing before the end of 2008, Weymouth and Portland will be the first in the United Kingdom to completely build a permanent venue for the Olympic Games.<ref name="wpnsaextension">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/6246176.stm | title = New Olympic marina plan approved | format = | work = | publisher = The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 2007-06-27}}</ref>

In addition to sailing, the waters of [[Weymouth Bay]] and [[Portland Harbour]] are frequently a venue for other water sports. The reliable sailing wind is also very favourable for [[windsurfing]] and [[kitesurfing]]. Chesil beach and other beaches around Portland, and the more sheltered waters of Portland Harbour are used regularly for [[angling]], [[diving]] to several shipwrecks, [[snorkelling]], [[canoeing]], and [[swimming]].<ref name="watersports">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/Leisure/Watersports/home.asp?svid=69 | title = Watersports in Weymouth and Portland | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref> The island is also an important destination for [[rock climbing]]. Portland has several areas of [[bouldering]] and deep water soloing, <ref name="rock climbing">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.rockfax.com/databases/results_area.html?id=5 | title = World Rock Climbing Information: Portland | format = | work = | publisher = ROCKFAX | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> whilst [[sport climbing]] with bolt protection is the most common style employed on the island.

==In literature==
In [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s 1990s books [[The Warlord Chronicles]] there is literary conjecture that Portland was once the [[Isle of the Dead (mythology)|Isle of the Dead]], a place of internal exile hundreds of years ago, where the causeway was guarded to keep the 'dead' (some of them being insane) from crossing [[the Fleet]] and returning back to Britain. However, this is not archaeological fact and there is no strong evidence of such occurances.<ref name="isleofthedead">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1999 | url = http://www.britishdowsers.org/EEG_site/archive/articles/aua2001_issue24/isleofdead_JHarvey_m.htm | title = The Isle of the Dead| format = | work = | publisher = British Society of Dowsers | accessdate = 2007-07-30}}</ref>

Dorset's most famous author, [[Thomas Hardy]] called Portland the ''Isle of Slingers'' in his novels; the isle was the main setting of ''[[The Well-Beloved]]'', and was featured in ''[[The Trumpet-Major]]''.<ref name="slingers">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.lymeregis.com/hardy_country/ | title = Thomas Hardy County and the Hardy Trail | format = | work = | publisher = Lyme Regis Tourist Information | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> It is well documented that islanders were expert stone-throwers in the defence of their island, and Hardy's ''Isle of Slingers'' is heavily based on Portland, with the ''Street of Wells'' representing Fortuneswell and ''The Beal'' as Portland Bill. He also named it the ''Gibraltar of the North'', with reference to the island's similarities with [[Gibraltar]]; its physical geography, isolation, comparatively mild climate and [[Underhill, Dorset|Underhill]]'s winding streets.<ref name="wellbeloved">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = [[Thomas Hardy]] | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Well-Beloved1.html | title = The Well-Beloved by Thomas Hardy | format = | work = | publisher = Full Books | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref>
