The [[International Olympic Committee]] was founded in 1894 on the initiative of a [[France|French]] nobleman, [[Pierre de Coubertin|Pierre Frédy, Baron de Coubertin]].  The IOC has become the heart of the "Olympic Movement," a conglomeration of sporting federations that are involved in the organization of the Games.  As the Olympic Movement has grown so has the profile and complexity of the Games.  Participation in the Games has increased to the point that nearly every nation on earth is represented.  With the proliferation of satellite communications, the internet, and the continuing trend towards [[globalization]], the Olympics are consistently gaining supporters.<ref name="Encarta">{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562380_5/Olympic_Games.html#s16 |title= Olympic Games - Recent Developments|accessdate=2008-08-26 |date=1997-2006 |work=Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopedia 2006 |publisher=Microsoft Corporation }}</ref>  This growth has created numerous challenges, including political [[boycott]]s, the use of performance enhancing medications, bribery of officials, and [[Munich massacre|terrorism]].  

Despite these challenges the Olympics have continued to thrive and flourish.  Each successive Games attempts to add more events in order to keep up with the ever-evolving advance of athletic expression around the world.  The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 games in Beijing]] had 302 events in 28 [[Olympic sports#Summer Olympic Games|sports]].<ref name=2008programme>{{cite news |url = http://olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=1797 |title = Beijing 2008: Games Programme Finalised |publisher = International Olympic Committee |date = [[2006-04-27]] |accessdate = 2008-08-26}}</ref> The most recent Winter Olympics in 2006 featured 84 events in 7 [[Olympic sports#Winter Olympic Games|sports]].<ref name="2006 Winter Olympics">{{cite web |url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=2006 |title = Turin 2006 |publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2008-08-26}}</ref>  While the Olympic Games do continue to evolve, they also encompass many rituals that were established during their infancy in the late 19th and early 20th century.  Most of these traditions are on display during the Opening and Closing ceremonies, and the medal presentations.  For its part, the Olympic Movement has made considerable progress in fostering participation among as many nations as wish to compete, as well as focusing on the Olympic motto: [[Olympic motto|Citius Altius Fortius]] - Faster, Higher, Stronger.

== Ancient Olympics ==
[[Image:Palestra at Olympia.jpg|thumb|left|Athletes trained in this Olympia facility in ancient times.]]
{{main|Ancient Olympic Games}}

There are many myths surrounding the origin of the ancient Olympic Games, the most popular of which identifies [[Heracles]] and his father [[Zeus]] as the creators of the games.  According to the legend, Zeus held sporting events in honor of his defeat of [[Cronus]], and his succession to the king of heaven.  Heracles, being his eldest son, defeated his brothers in a running race and was crowned with a wreath of wild olive branches.  It is Heracles who is believed to have first called the games Olympic, and established the custom of holding them every 4 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Aabo%3Atlg%2C0525%2C001&query=5%3A7%3A7|title=Elis 1|author=Pausanias|publisher=Perseus at Tufts University |accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref> The legend diverges at this point.  One popular story says that Heracles went on to build the Olympic stadium and surrounding buildings as an honor to Zeus, after he completed his [[12 labors]]. After he built the stadium he walked in a straight line for 200 strides and called this distance a "[[stadion]]" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: στάδιον, [[Latin]]: ''stadium'', "stage") that later also became a unit of distance.  Another myth associates the first Games with the ancient Greek concept of ἐκεχειρία (''ekecheiria''), Olympic truce. The date of the Games' creation was based on a four year cycle.  The most widely held estimate for the inception of the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webwinds.com/thalassa/olympics.htm|title=The Ancient Olympics, Their Origin in Greek Mythology and Religion|first=Tracy|last=Marks|publisher=Webwinds.com |accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>.

From then on, the Olympic Games quickly became much more important throughout ancient Greece, reaching their zenith in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, contests alternating with sacrifices and ceremonies honouring both Zeus (whose [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|colossal statue]] stood at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]), and [[Pelops]], divine hero and mythical king of Olympia, who was famous for his legendary chariot races with [[Oenomaus|King Oenomaus]] of [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisatis]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/olympics/a/aa021798.htm|title=Ancient Olympics-Details on the Ancient Olympic Games|first=N.S.|last=Gill|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>. The number of events increased to twenty, and the celebration was spread over several days. Winners of the events were greatly admired and were immortalised in poems and statues.<ref name="Ancient Gods IOC">{{cite web |url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/gods_uk.asp |title = Ancient Olympic Games- Gods |publisher =  Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2006-12-28}}</ref> The Games were held every four years, and the period between two celebrations became known as an [[Olympiad]]. The Greeks used Olympiads as one of their units of time measurement. The most famous Ancient Olympic athlete lived during the sixth century BC: the wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] is the only athlete in history to win a victory in six Olympics.<ref name="Ancient Athletes IOC">{{cite web |url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp |title = Ancient Olympic Games- Athletes |publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2006-12-28}}</ref>

The Games gradually declined in importance as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] gained power in Greece. After Emperor [[Theodosius I]] proclaimed Christianity the religion of the Empire in AD 393 and banned pagan rites, the Olympic Games were outlawed as a pagan festival. <ref name="Ancient IOC">{{cite web |url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp |title = The Ancient Olympic Games |publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2006-12-28}}</ref>  The Olympics were not seen again until their rebirth 1,500 years later.

In antiquity normally only young men could participate.<ref name="Ancient Athletes IOC" /> The sportsmen usually competed nude.  This was due in part to the weather and also because the festival was meant to be a celebration of the achievements of the human body. Upon winning the event, the victor would have not only the prestige of being in first place but would also be presented with a crown of olive leaves. The [[olive branch]] is a sign of hope and peace.<ref name="Ancient History IOC">{{cite web |url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/history_uk.asp |title = Ancient Olympic Games: History |publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2006-12-28}}</ref>  While the symbol of the olive branch has carried through from the Ancient Games to the modern reinvention, many other current [[Olympic symbols]] are unique to the Modern Olympics.  The bearing of a torch, for example, formed an integral part of Greek ceremonies but the Ancient Games did not include a torch-lighting ceremony, nor was there a symbol formed by interconnecting rings.

== Revival == 

Although the revival of the Olympic Games began in the mid-19th Century, many sports events with titles such as "Olympick" or "Olympian" Games were held before that and as early as the 16th Century. These sports events should not be confused with the re-establishment of the Olympic Games in modern times. These included an "Olympick Games" sports festival that was run for several years at [[Chipping Campden]] in the English [[Cotswolds]].  The present day local [[Cotswold Games|Olympick Games]] trace their origin to this festival<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=862|title=Origin of Robert Dover's Games|publisher=Robert Dover's Cotswold Olimpicks|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>.

Annually, from 1796-1798, L'Olympiade de la République was held in revolutionary France, and is an early forerunner to the modern summer Olympic Games. The premier event of this competition was a footrace, but various ancient Greek disciplines were also on display. The 1796 Olympiade also marks the introduction of the metric system into sport<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lepotentiel.com/afficher_supplement.php?id_article=68524&id_supplement=8&id_edition=4405|title=Histoire et évolution des Jeux olympiques|publisher=Potentiel|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>.

In 1833, the poet Panagiotis Soutsos mentions a revival of the ancient Olympic Games in modern times in his poetry.  This is followed by an "Olympian Class" was begun at [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]], [[England]] in 1850<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ahistoryofgreece.com/revolution.htm|title=The Greek Revolution of 1821|publisher=Ahistoryofgreece.com|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>. This was renamed "Wenlock Olympian Games" in 1859 and continues to this day as the [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games]]. The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded in 1860. A national Olympic Games in [[Great Britain]] was organised by their founder, [[William Penny Brookes]], at Crystal Palace in [[London]], in 1866. This national Olympic Games was the first games to actually resemble an Olympic Games to be held outside of Greece<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml|title=Much Wenlock & the Olympian Connection|publisher=Wenlock Olympican Society|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>.

Meanwhile [[Evangelos Zappas]], a wealthy Greek philanthropist, sponsored the first modern revival of the Olympic Games.<ref name=Young/> The first modern international Olympic Games was held in an Athens city square in 1859.  Zappas paid for the refurbishment of the ancient [[Panathinaiko Stadium|Panathenian Stadium]]. This first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium was hosted there in 1870, followed by a second 1875. The same stadium was refurbished a second time and used for the Athens 1896 Games. The revival of the Olympic Games, sponsored by Zappas was a dedicated Olympic Games composed of athletes from two countries: Greece and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The interest in reviving the Olympics as an international event grew further when the ruins of ancient [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] were uncovered by German [[archaeologist]]s in the mid-nineteenth century. At the same time, [[Pierre de Coubertin]] was searching for a reason for the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870&ndash;1871). He thought the reason was that the French had not received proper physical education, and desired to improve this<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history1900s.about.com/library/weekly/aa081000a.htm|title=A History of the Olympics|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>. Coubertin also sought a way to bring nations closer together, to have the youth of the world compete in sports, rather than fight in war. In 1890 he attended the "Olympian Games" of the Wenlock Olympian Society, and decided that the recovery of the Olympic Games would achieve both of his goals.

Baron Pierre de Coubertin built on the ideas of Brookes and the foundations of Evangelos Zappas.  His aim was to globalize the Olympic Games and to that end he established the International Olympic Committee. In a [[Olympic Congress|congress]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] University, in [[Paris]], [[France]], held from [[June 16]] to [[June 23]], [[1894]] he presented his ideas to an international audience. On the last day of the congress, it was decided that the first IOC Olympic Games would take place in 1896 in [[Athens]], in the country of their birth. To organise the Games, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) was established, with the Greek [[Demetrius Vikelas]] as its first president. The [[Panathinaiko Stadium|Panathenian Stadium]] used for the Olympic Games of 1870 and 1875 was refurbished a second time in readiness for the 1896 Games<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history1900s.about.com/library/weekly/aa081000a.htm|title=A History of the Olympics|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>.

The total number of athletes at the [[1896 Summer Olympics|the first IOC Olympic Games]] was less than 250, which at the time was the largest international sports event ever<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.2008olympicsinbeijing.com/olympic-games/modern/|title=Modern Olympics|publisher=2008olympicsinbeijing.com|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>. This first Modern Olympics had only nine disciplines: [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Athletics]], [[Cycling at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Cycling]], [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Fencing]], [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Gymnastics]], [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Shooting]], [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Swimming]], [[Tennis at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Tennis]], [[Weightlifting at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Weightlifting]], and [[Wrestling at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Wrestling]]. The Greek officials and public were very enthusiastic about hosting the inaugural games, and at one point offered to host the Olympic Games permanently.  The IOC decided differently, however, and the [[1900 Summer Olympics|second Olympic Games]] took place in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It was at the Paris Games that women were allowed to compete<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0114360.html|title=1900 Olympics Paris|publisher=Infoplease.com|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>.

== Modern Olympics ==
{{main|Summer Olympic Games|Winter Olympic Games}}
[[Image:US Olympic Committee Headquarters 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Olympic Committee]]'s training facilities at their headquarters in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].]]
After the initial success, the Olympics struggled. The celebrations in [[1900 Summer Olympics|Paris (1900)]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|St. Louis (1904)]] were overshadowed by the [[World's Fair]] exhibitions, which were held at the same time and location. The [[1906 Summer Olympics|1906 Intercalated Games]] (so-called because they were the second games held within the third Olympiad) were held in Athens, as the first of an alternating series of Athens-held Olympics. Although originally the IOC recognised and supported these games, they are currently not recognised by the IOC as Olympic Games, which has given rise to the explanation that they were intended to mark the 10th anniversary of the modern Olympics. The 1906 Games again attracted a broad international field of participants (in 1904 over 70% of the athletes had been American)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0114372.html|title=1904 Olympics St. Louis|publisher=infoplease.com|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref> and generated great public interest, thereby marking the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Games.

From the 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, the Games have grown to nearly 11,000 competitors from 201 countries at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=2004|title=Athens 2004|publisher=IOC|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>. The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is much smaller than that of their Summer counterpart.  For example, [[Turin]] [[Italy]] hosted 2,508 athletes from 80 countries competing in 84 events during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=2006|title=Turin 2006|publisher=IOC|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>.  As participation in the Olympics has grown, so has its profile in the international media.  The Olympic Games are one of the world's largest media events. At the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Games]] in 2000, an estimated 3.7 billion viewers [[broadcasting of sports events|watched the games]] on [[television]], and the official website of the Sydney Olympics generated over 11.3 billion hits<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/facts/introduction/100years_uk.asp|title=100 Years of Olympic Marketing|publisher=IOC|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>.  The sale of broadcast rights has turned into an integral part of the formula by which countries recoup some of the costs incurred by hosting the Games.  

Financing the Olympics is one of the largest problems faced by the IOC and host countries today. Although allowing professional athletes and attracting sponsorships from major international companies solved financial problems in the 1980s, the large number of athletes, media and spectators makes it difficult and expensive for host cities to organize the Olympics. For example, the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] (which will be held in London), is expected to have a budget of over £9 billion—one of the largest budgets for an Olympics to date<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6453575.stm|title=Olympics Budget Rises to £9.32bn|date=2007-03-07|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>.  Corporate sponsorships do lighten the load in terms of the debt that these countries take on, but as the Games continue to grow, the IOC and host countries will have to address the ever-increasing price tag that comes with the honor of hosting an Olympic Games. 

Despite the Olympics usually being associated with one host city, most of the Olympics have had events held in other cities, especially the football and sailing events. There have been three Olympics in which events were held in a different country: during the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp Olympics]] two sailing races were held in the [[Netherlands]]; and during the [[1956 Melbourne Olympics]] [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] were held in [[Sweden]]. The 2008 Beijing Olympics marked the third time that Olympic events were held in the territories of two different [[National Olympic Committee|NOC]]'s: equestrian events were held in [[Hong Kong]] (which competes separately from mainland China).

203 countries currently participate in the Olympics. This is a noticeably higher tally than the number of countries belonging to the [[United Nations]], which currently stands at 193. The International Olympic Committee allows nations to compete which do not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that many other international organizations demand. As a result, many colonies and dependencies are permitted to host their own Olympic teams and athletes even if such competitors also hold citizenship in another member nation. Examples of this include territories such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Bermuda]], and [[Hong Kong]], all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country. Also, since 1980, [[Taiwan]] has competed under the name [[Chinese Taipei]], and under a flag specially prepared by the IOC. Prior to that year the [[People's Republic of China]] refused to participate in the Games because Taiwan had been competing under the name [[Republic of China]]<ref name=corbit>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaorbit.com/2008-olympics-china/olympic-games-history.html|title=China-Olympic History|publisher=Chinaorbit.com|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>. The Republic of the [[Marshall Islands]] was recognised as a nation by the IOC on February 9, 2006, and competed in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=1-3849-0-0-0&sID=40439|title = About MINOC|publisher = Marshall Islands National Olympic Committee| date = [[2006-02-14]] | accessdate = 2008-08-26}}</ref>

=== Boycotts ===
{{main|Olympic boycotts}}
The [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]] were the first Olympics to be [[boycott]]ed. [[The Netherlands]], [[Spain]], and [[Switzerland]] refused to attend because of the repression of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungarian Uprising]] by the [[Soviet Union]]; additionally, [[Cambodia]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]] and [[Lebanon]] boycotted the games due to the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name="Boycott 1">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/innovations_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1956 |title= Melbourne/Stockholm 1956: Did you know?|accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher= International Olympic Committee}}</ref>

In [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott, to force them to ban [[South Africa]], [[Rhodesia]], and [[New Zealand]]. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand in 1976 because the boycott was prompted by a New Zealand [[rugby union]] tour to South Africa, and rugby was not an Olympic sport. The countries withdrew their teams after the games had started; some African athletes had already competed. A lot of sympathy was felt for the athletes forced by their governments to leave the Olympic Village<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/17/newsid_3555000/3555450.stm|title=On This Day|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>.

Also at the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal Games of 1976]], the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[PRC]]) exerted pressure on the IOC to keep the team from the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) from competing under the name "[[Republic of China]]".  Despite a compromise that would have allowed [[Taiwan]] to use the [[flag of the Republic of China|ROC flag]] and [[National Anthem of the Republic of China|anthem]], the Republic of China refused to agree and as a result did not participate again until 1984, when it returned under the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]" and used a special flag.<ref name=corbit/>

[[Image:Olympic boycotts 1976 1980 1984.PNG|left|thumb|Countries that boycotted the 1976 (yellow), 1980 (blue) and 1984 (red) games]]
In 1980 and 1984, the [[Cold War]] opponents boycotted each other's games. Sixty-five nations refused to compete at the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics in 1980]] because of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. The boycott reduced the number of nations participating to only 81, the lowest number of nations to compete since 1956. The [[Soviet Union]] and 14 of its [[Eastern Bloc]] partners (except [[Romania]]) countered by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics in 1984]].  They contended that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes.

There had been growing calls for boycotts of the [[2008 Olympics]] in [[Beijing]] in protest of [[China]]'s [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|poor human rights record]] and response to the recent disturbances in [[Tibet]], [[Darfur]], and [[Taiwan]]. [[President George W. Bush]] showcased these concerns in a highly publicized speech in Thailand just prior to the opening of the Games.  Ultimately no nations withdrew before the games began. There have also been campaigns calling for Chinese goods to be boycotted.<ref>[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41699 AUSTRALIA: Calls to Boycott Beijing Olympics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=174 Reporters sans frontières - Beijing 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Diplomats_visit_Tibet_as_EU_split_on_Olympic_opening_boycott_/articleshow/2908958.cms Diplomats visit Tibet as EU split on Olympic opening boycott]</ref>

=== Doping ===
One of the main problems facing the Olympics (and sports in general) is [[doping (sport)|doping]], or the use of performance enhancing drugs. In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve their athletic abilities. For example, the winner of the [[marathon (sports)|marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]], [[Thomas J. Hicks]], was given [[strychnine]] and [[brandy]] by his coach, even during the race<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>. As these methods became more extreme, it became increasingly evident that doping was not only a threat to the integrity of sport, but could also have potentially fatal side-effects on the athlete. The only Olympic death linked to doping occurred at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome Games of 1960]]. At the cycling road race in Rome, Danish cyclist [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zimbio.com/2008+Beijing+Summer+Olympic+Games/articles/113/Top+10+Olympic+Scandals|title=Top 10 Olympic Scandals|author=Tatiana|date=2008-08-04|publisher=Zimbio.com|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>.  By the mid-1960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance enhancing drugs, and the IOC followed suit in 1967<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|title=The Drug Charade|first=Sharon|last=Begley|publisher=Newsweek|date=2008-01-07|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>.

The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance enhancing drugs was [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]], a Swedish [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.123exp-biographies.com/t/00034345906/|title=Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall|publiser=123explore.com|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>. The most publicised doping-related disqualification was that of [[Canada|Canadian]] sprinter [[Ben Johnson (athlete)|Ben Johnson]], who won the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics|100 meter dash]] at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Seoul Olympics]], but tested positive for [[stanozolol]].  He subsequently had his gold medal stripped.  It was awarded to runner-up [[Carl Lewis]], who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics, but was not banned<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|title= Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|date=2003-04-18|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.  
 
Despite the testing, many athletes continued to use medication to improve their athletic ability without getting caught. In 1990, documents were revealed that showed many [[East Germany|East German]] female athletes had been unknowingly administered [[anabolic steroid]]s and other drugs by their coaches and trainers.  Girls as young as eleven were started on the drug regimen without prior consent from their parents.  American female swimmers, including [[Shirley Babashoff]], accused the East Germans of using performance enhancing drugs as early as the 1976 Games<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/brennan/2004-07-15-brennan_x.htm|title=Babashoff had Mettle to Speak out about Steroids|first=Christine|last=Brennan|date=2004-07-14|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.  No clear evidence of doping was discovered until after the fall of the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|Berlin Wall]], when the aforementioned documents proved that East Germany had embarked on a state-sponsored program to dramatically improve their competitiveness at the Olympic Games and other international sporting events.  Many of the culprits have been subsequently tried and found guilty of various crimes in the German penal system<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E3D71330F931A15757C0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=Just Following Orders, Doctors' Orders|first=Jere|last=Longman|date=2001-04-22|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,786574,00.html|title=Sports Doping Statistics Reach Plateau in Germany|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=2006-02-26|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.

In the late 1990s, the IOC took initiative in a more organised battle against doping, leading to the formation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in 1999. The recent 2000 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics have shown that this battle is not nearly over, as several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified due to doping offences. One possibly innocent victim of the anti-doping movement at the Olympics was the Romanian gymnast [[Andreea Răducan]] who was stripped of her gold medal in the All-Around Competition of the 2000 Sydney games. Test results indicated the presence of the banned stimulant [[pseudophedrine]] which had been prescribed to her by an Olympic doctor. Raducan had been unaware of the presence of the illegal substance in the medicine that had been prescribed to her for a cold she had during the games<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2000/gymnastics/news/2000/09/27/raducan_decision_ap/|title=Arbitrators Uphold Decision to Strip Raducan of Gold|date=2000-11-13|publisher=Sports Illustrated and CNN|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.  During the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The only other case involved 12 athletes with high levels of [[haemoglobin]] and their punishment was a five day suspension for health reasons.  In a response to allegations of wide-spread steroid use among participating athletes during the 1980's and 1990's, the IOC established an aggressive drug testing regimine, which continues to become more complex and comprehensive with each successive Olympics.  During the Beijing games 3667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency.  Both urine and blood testing was used in a coordinated effort to detect not only banned substances but also [[blood doping]].  While several athletes were barred from competition by their National Olympic Committees prior to the Games, 3 athletes failed drug tests while in competition in Beijing<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Doping-3667-athletes-tested-IOC-seeks-action-against-Halkias-coach/350677/|title=Doping: 3667 athletes tested, IOC seeks action against Halkia's coach|date=2008-08-19|publisher=Expressindia.com|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/dynamic.ch2?pageCategory.id=312|title=A Brief History of Anti-Doping|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency|accessdate=2008-08-28}} This is an excellent source for further research on Anti-Doping efforts not only in the Olympic Movement but across the international sports scene</ref>.

=== Politics ===
[[Image:Carlos-Smith.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tommie Smith]] (center) and [[John Carlos]] (right) showing the [[raised fist]] in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]].]]
{{main|Politics in the Olympics}}
The Olympics have been affected by political incidents on many occasions.  The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]] are an example of how the Olympics have been used to promote a political agenda.  The German [[Nazi Party]] promoted the 1936 Games as [[propaganda]] for the superiority of both the [[aryan|Aryan race]] and the [[facist]] political structure.  In a stunning reversal, [[Luz Long]], a German competitor in the long jump, helped [[Jesse Owens]] (a [[Black people|black]] athlete) to win the long jump, at the expense of his own chance to win the event; some describe this as the "true Olympic Spirit."  For his efforts he was posthumously awarded the [[Pierre de Coubertin Medal]]<ref name="Nazi Olympics">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/olympics.html |title= The Nazi Olympics|accessdate=2008-08-28 |date=2006 |publisher= The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise}}</ref>. In a similar vein, the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] did not participate in the Olympic Games until the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]]. Instead, in 1928 the Soviets organized an international sports event called [[Spartakiad]]s. Many athletes from [[Communist]] countries or from countries with close political ties to the Soviet Union chose not to participate, or were even barred from participating in Olympic Games, and instead participated in Spartakiads.<ref name=GSE>[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd edition, volume 24 (part 1), p. 286, Moscow, Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya publisher, 1976</ref>

A political incident on a smaller scale occurred at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]]. Two American track-and-field athletes, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], who finished first and third in the 200-meter [[track and field]] race, performed the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] on the victory stand. The second place finisher, [[Peter Norman]], wore an [[Olympic Project for Human Rights]] badge in support of Smith and Carlos.  In response to the protest, the IOC's president, [[Avery Brundage]], told the [[United States Olympic Committee]] to either send the two athletes home, or withdraw the complete track and field team. The USOC opted for the former.<ref name="Black Salute">{{cite news |title=1968: Black athletes make silent protest |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm|publisher= BBC |accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>  The photo of the three men on the medal podium has become an iconic Olympic image<ref>{{cite news |title=Iconic Image of Protest Still Resonates|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2008/0804/1217628486446.html|date=2008-08-04|publisher=Irish Times|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>.  

Interference of politics in the Games is not a thing of the past.  Currently, the government of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] specifically orders its athletes not to compete in any Olympic heat, semi-final, or final that includes athletes from [[Israel]].  This directive had an impact at the 2004 Olympics when an Iranian [[judoka]] who had otherwise earned his place, did not compete in a heat against an Israeli judoka.<ref name="Iran-Israel">{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200408/s1177025.htm |title=Games hit by crisis over Iran-Israel contest |date=[[2004-08-16]] |accessdate=2008-08-28 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]}}</ref>

=== Violence ===
Despite what Coubertin had hoped for, the Olympics did not bring total peace to the world. In fact, three [[Olympiad]]s had to pass without a celebration of the Games because of war: due to [[World War I]] the [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916 Games]] were cancelled, and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of [[World War II]]. The [[2008 South Ossetia war|South Ossetia War]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]] erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Terrorism has also threatened the Olympic Games. In 1972, when the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] were held in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], eleven members of the [[Israel at the Olympics|Israel]]i Olympic team were taken hostage by the [[terrorist]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]] in what is now known as the [[Munich massacre]]. A bungled liberation attempt led to the deaths of the nine abducted athletes who had not been killed prior to the rescue.  Also killed were five of the terrorists and a German policeman<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-41-1289-7332/sports/olympics_cbc/clip5|title=Olympic archive|publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.  Another example of terrorism at the Olympics came during the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in 1996]] in [[Atlanta]].  A [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb]] was detonated at the [[Centennial Olympic Park]], which killed 2 and injured 111 others. The bomb was set by [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], an American [[domestic terrorist]], who is currently serving a life sentence at [[ADX Florence]] in [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Colorado]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main|title=Olympic Park Bombing|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

The [[2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics in 2002]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] were the first Olympic games held since [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. These Games saw a dramatic increase in the amount of money spent on security. Due to the already high profile of the Olympic Games around the world, it is feared that they will continue to present prime targets for terrorist organizations.  Therefore, increasingly stringent security protocols are now required for all Olympic games.

The Olympics have also been used by regimes with human rights crises to try and silence their opposition.  The Mexican government, ten days prior to the 1968 Summer Olympics, used the impending Olympic games as an excuse to crack down on student demonstrations in [[Mexico City]].  The incident would become known as the [[Tlatelolco Massacre]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/mexico1.htm|title=1968 Student Massacre|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.  The Chinese government has been accused of similar tactics in their dealings with the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]] before the [[Beijing Olympics]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/03/24/MNK6VMJJK.DTL|title=Tibet Unrest Raises Concerns on China Olympics|first=Kathleen|last=Mclaughlin|date=2008-03-24|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.  The concern in both of these examples is the propensity of host countries to use the Olympic Games as a reason to repress political dissent within their own borders.

== Olympic Movement ==
The "Olympic Movement" is difficult to define.  To speak in broad terms, the Olympic Movement is sometimes meant to include everybody and everything involved in the Olympics.  This would include national sport governing bodies, athletes, media, and sponsors of the Olympic Games.  The rules and guidelines by which these organizations and individuals operate are outlined in the [[Olympic Charter]].  The governing body of the Olympic Movement is the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), currently headed by [[Jacques Rogge]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nalis.gov.tt/olympics/olympics.htm|title=The Olympics|publiser=National Library and Information System Authority
|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref>.  The IOC oversees the organization of the Olympic games and insures the host city is meeting its obligations.  The IOC makes all the important decisions; such as choosing the host city for each Games, and the event programme of the Olympics.  Beyond the role of the IOC, there are a great number of other organizations that contribute to the Olympic Movement.  Three of these groups are listed below:  

* International Federations (IFs), the governing bodies of a sport (''e.g.'', [[FIFA]], the IF for [[football (soccer)]], and the [[FIVB]], the international governing body for [[volleyball]].)  There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/ioc/n214186786.shtml|title=For the Good of the Athletes|date=2007-10-31|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.
* National Olympic Committees (NOCs), which regulate the Olympic Movement within each country (''e.g.,'' [[USOC]], the NOC of the [[United States]]).  There are 203 NOCs that are recognized by the IOC<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/11444041/|title=Usual Suspects Dominate Olympic Medal Count|date=2006-02-21|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.
* [[Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games]] (OCOG), which is the committee responsible for the organisation of a specific celebration of the Olympics.  OCOGs are dissolved after the celebration of each Games, once all subsequent paperwork has been completed.

=== Criticism ===
One of the criticisms leveled at the IOC is their favoritism of host cities from the [[Western world|West]]. Of the 49 [[List of Olympic host cities|cities]] that have or will host an Olympic Winter or Summer games, 42 are located in either Europe or North America. It should be noted that since the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], the Olympics have been held in Asia/Oceania 4 times, which is a sharp increase compared to the previous 92 years of modern Olympic history. All bids by countries in [[South America]] and [[Africa]] have failed. Many believe the games should expand to include locations in poorer regions. Some people assert that the infrastructure investments could provide significant long term benefit<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2007-10-04-sochi-olympics_N.htm|title=Controversy comes to Sochi Games|first=George and Ana|last=Lurie|date=2007-10-19|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.  However, many host cities view the high costs associated with hosting the games as a poor investment<ref>{{cite news

In the past, the [[IOC]] has often been criticised for being a monolithic organization, with several members remaining on the Committee for life. The leadership of IOC president [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] was especially controversial.  Under his presidency, the Olympic Movement made great progress, but was also viewed as autocratic and corrupt<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html|title=Samaranch Defends Nominating Son for IOC Post|date=2001-05-18|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>. Samaranch's ties with the [[Spain under Franco|Franco regime]] in [[Spain]] and his long term as an IOC president (21 years, until he was 81 years old) have been points of criticism<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/oly/columns/garber_greg/1225329.html|title=Samaranch's Legacy:Controversy, Corruption|first=Greg|last=Garber|date=2007-07-12|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-08-28}} This is an excellent, balanced article on Samaranch's tenure as IOC President</ref>.

In 1998, it became known that several IOC members had [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|taken bribes]] from the organising committee for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], in exchange for a vote on the city at the election of the host city. The IOC started an investigation, which led to four members resigning and six being expelled. The scandal set off further reforms, changing the way in which host cities are elected to avoid further bribes. Also, more active and former athletes were allowed in the IOC, and the membership terms have been limited<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/olympic.probe/overview/|title=Bribery Scandal Dulls Olympics' Century-old Shrine|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.

In the same year (1998), four European groups organized the International Network Against Olympic Games and Commercial Sports to oppose their cities' bids for future Olympic Games<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~vholmber/antiolympia/inaogcs.html|title=International Network Against Olympic Games and Commercial Sports|publisher=INAOGCS|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>. Also, an Anti-Olympic Alliance had formed in [[Sydney]] to protest the hosting of the 2000 Games. Later, a similar movement in [[Vancouver]] and Whistler, [[British Columbia]] organized to protest the hosting of the 2010 Winter Games. These movements were particularly concerned about adverse local economic impact and dislocation of people to accommodate the hosting of the Olympics<ref>{{cite web |url=http://no2010.com/node/211|title=Anti-Olympic Opposition:Sydney 2000 and Turino 2006|date=2008-02-23|publisher=no2010.com|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.

A [[BBC]] documentary aired in August 2004, entitled ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]: "Buying the Games"'', investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. The documentary claimed it is possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games<ref>{{cite news

[[Paris]]ian Mayor [[Bertrand Delanoë]] specifically accused the [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and the London Bid Committee (headed by former Olympic gold medalist [[Sebastian Coe]]) of breaking the bid rules with financial and bribes. He cited French President [[Jacques Chirac]] as a witness but President Chirac gave rather more guarded interviews. In particular, [[Bulgaria]]'s member [[Ivan Slavkov]], and [[Muttaleb Ahmad]] from the [[Olympic Council of Asia]], were implicated. They have denied the allegations. Mayor Delanoë never mentioned the matter again<ref>{{cite news |title=Paris Mayor Slams London Tactics|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/london2012/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=others/05/07/06/manual_125524.html|work=sportinglife.com|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Mark|last=Beard|title=Olympic Inspectors call on London (while Paris accusses Britain of bribery|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20060420/ai_n16147121|work=bnet.com|date=[[April 20]] [[2006]]| accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>.  The [[Turin]] bid for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] was also shrouded in controversy.  A prominent member of the IOC, [[Marc Hodler]], himself strongly connected with rival [[Sion, Switzerland]]'s bid, exposed alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee.  These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation.  The allegations also served to sour many IOC members to Sion's bid and in fact may have helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.<ref>{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Berkes|title=How Turin got the Games|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195274|work=npr.org|date=[[February 7]] [[2006]]| accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

The Olympic Movement has been accused of being overprotective of its symbolism (in particular, it claims an exclusive copyright over any arrangement of five rings and the term "Olympics"), and have taken action against things unrelated to sport, such as the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Legend of the Five Rings]]''. It was accused of [[homophobia]] in 1982 when it successfully sued the Gay Olympics, an event now known as the [[Gay Games]], to ban it from using the term "Olympics" in its name.<ref>{{cite news

{{main|Olympic symbols}}

The Olympic movement uses many symbols, most of them representing Coubertin's ideas and ideals. The [[Olympic Rings]] are the most widely recognized symbol. These five intertwined rings represent the unity of the five inhabited continents (with the [[Americas]] regarded as one continent). The five colored rings on a white field form the [[Olympic Flag]]. The colors, white, red, blue, green, yellow, and black, were chosen because each nation has at least one of these colors in its national flag. The flag was adopted in [[1914]], but the first Games at which it was flown were at [[1920 Summer Olympics|Antwerp 1920]]. It is hoisted at each celebration of the Games<ref name=olympicsymbols>{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1303.pdf|(PDF File)|title=The Olympic Symbols|publisher=The Olympic Museum|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.

The [[Olympic Motto]] is "''Citius, Altius, Fortius''," a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "Swifter, Higher, Stronger." Coubertin's ideals are probably best illustrated by the [[Olympic Creed]]:

:''"The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well<ref name=olympicsymbols/>."''

Prior to each Games, the [[Olympic Flame]] is lit in Olympia, Greece and brought to the host city by runners carrying the torch in relay. There it plays an important role in the opening ceremonies. Though the torch fire has been around since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the relay was introduced in [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]] as part of the then German government's attempt to promote their [[National Socialist]] ideology<ref name=olympicsymbols/>.

The Olympic mascot, an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. It has played an important part of the games since [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] with the debut of [[Misha]], a [[Russia]]n [[bear]].  The mascots of the most recent Olympic Games in Beijing were called the [[Fuwa]].  They are five creatures that represent the five [[fengshui]] elements important to Chinese culture<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214068254.shtml|title=The Official Mascots of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.

[[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] are the official languages of the Olympic movement.  The other official language used at each respective Olympic Games is the language of the host country.  Consequently, every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the Opening Ceremonies) is spoken in French, English and the host country's native language<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/charter_uk.asp|title=The Olympic Charter|publisher=IOC|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>.

== Olympic ceremonies ==
=== Opening ===
[[Image:BeijingOlimpicGames2008-08-08.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional part of the opening ceremony is an aritistic display by the host country.  Here is a scene from the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.]]
As mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremonies of a celebration of the Olympic Games.<ref name=OCFactSheetS>{{cite book | url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1134.pdf | title=Fact sheet: Opening Ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games | date=February 2008 | accessdate=2008-08-14 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name=OCFactSheetW>{{cite book | url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1036.pdf | title=Fact sheet: Opening Ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games | date=February 2008 | accessdate=2008-08-14 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF}}</ref> Most of these rituals were established by the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].<ref name=OCprotocol1>{{cite book |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf |title=The Modern Olympic Games |chapter=The development of the Games - Between festival and tradition |chapterurl=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf#pages=5 |accessdate=2008-08-29 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |pages=p. 5}}</ref>

The ceremonies typically start with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/>. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of the culture of that country.<ref name=OCprotocol1/>

The traditional part of the ceremonies starts with a "Parade of Nations" (or of athletes), during which most participating athletes march into the stadium, country by country. Each country's delegation is led by a sign with the name of their country and by their nation's flag.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/>

Traditionally (starting at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]), Greece enters first, due to its historical status as the origin of the Olympics, while the host nation marches last.<ref name=OCprotocol1/> (In 2004, when the Games were held in Athens, Greece marched last as host nation rather than first, although the [[flag of Greece]] was carried in first.) Between these two nations, all other participating nations march in alphabetical order of the dominant language of the host country,<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> or in French or English alphabetical order if the host country does not write its dominant language in an alphabet which has a set order. In the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] were official languages of the games, but due to politics surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in [[French language|French]] alphabetical order. The [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Japan]] saw nations entering in [[English language|English]] alphabetical order since the [[Japanese language]] grouped both China and Chinese Taipei together in the Parade of Nations.  For the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], instead of using either French or English, the countries were ordered by how many strokes it took to write the country's name in [[Simplified Chinese]]. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china1 |title=Beijing Olympics open with spectacular ceremony|first=Peter|last=Walker|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-08-08|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

After all nations have entered, the president of the host country's Olympic Organising Committee makes a speech, followed by the IOC president who, at the end of his speech, introduces the representative of the host country who declares the Games open by reciting the formula: <blockquote>''I declare open the Games of [name of the host city] celebrating the [ordinal number of the Olympiad] Olympiad of the modern era/[ordinal number of Winter Olympics] Olympic Winter Games''.<ref name="OCprotocol2">  {{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|title=Olympic Charter - in force as from 7 July 2007|publisher=IOC|accessdate=2008-08-29}}.</ref></blockquote>

Before 1936, the Opener often used to make a short Speech of Welcome before declaring the Games open. However, since 1936 when [[Adolf Hitler]] opened both the [[1936 Winter Olympics|Garmisch Partenkirchen Winter Olympics]] and the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Summer Olympics]], the Openers have unswervingly stuck to that formula. There have been two exceptions:

* In 1984, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] opened the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Summer Olympics]] with:

<blockquote>''Celebrating the XXIII Olympiad of the modern era, I declare open the Olympic Games of Los Angeles''.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J5U8tnVb2A&feature=related YouTube - '84 Olympics - Olympic Hymn]</ref></blockquote>

*In 2002, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] opened the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City]], which were the first Olympic games held since [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], with 

<blockquote>''On behalf of a proud, determined and grateful nation,'' then the standard opening formula following.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKypHcgk-Dc&feature=related YouTube - SLC 2002 OC - Bush's Proclamation and the Olympic Flag]</ref></blockquote>

What Bush said when he opened those games was made evident by [[Jacques Rogge|Dr. Jacques Rogge]], presiding over his first Olympics as [[IOC president]], telling the athletes of the host country that their nation was overcoming the "horrific tragedy" of that day and the IOC stands united with them in promoting the committee's ideals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_286.pdf |format=PDF |title=Remarks of the IOC President, XIX Olympic Winter Games |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2006-05-31}}</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtNYyIapl8&feature=related YouTube - Salt Lake City 2002 OC - Rogge's First OG Speech Ever]</ref>

Despite the Games having been awarded to a particular city and not to the country in general, the Olympic Charter presently requires the Opener to be the host country's [[head of state]].<ref name="OCprotocol2" /> However, there have been many cases where someone other than the host country's head of state opened the Games. The first example was at the [[Games of the II Olympiad]] in Paris in 1900, when there wasn't even an Opening Ceremony. There are five examples from the United States alone where the Games were not opened by the head of state.<ref>The first case was the [[Games of the III Olympiad]] in St Louis, Missouri where &ndash; on [[1 July]] [[1904]] &ndash; Mr. David Francis, President of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, performed the ceremony, nobody having even thought of inviting US President Theodore Roosevelt. Then, on 4 February 1932 the then-[[Governor]] of the [[State of New York]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], opened the [[III Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York]] and later that year, on 30 July 1932, the Vice-President of the United States, [[Charles Curtis]] opened the [[Games of the X Olympiad]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], stating, however, that he was doing so on behalf of the [[President]], [[Herbert Hoover]]. In 1960, the [[Vice-President of the United States]] [[Richard Nixon]] was sent by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] to open the [[VIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Squaw Valley, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], and finally, in 1980, Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] stood in for President [[Jimmy Carter]] to open the [[XIII Olympic Winter Games]], also in Lake Placid.</ref>

Next, the Olympic Flag is carried horizontally (since the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]) into the stadium and hoisted as the [[Olympic Anthem]] is played. The Olympic Charter states that the Olympic Flag must "fly for the entire duration
of the Olympic Games from a flagpole placed in a prominent position in the main stadium".<ref name="OCprotocol2"/>

The flag bearers of all countries then circle a [[rostrum]], where one athlete (since the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]) and one judge (since the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]) speak the [[Olympic Oath]], declaring they will compete and judge according to the rules.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> Finally, the [[Olympic Torch|Torch]] is brought into the stadium, passed from athlete to athlete, until it reaches the last carrier of the Torch, often a well-known athlete from the host nation, who lights the fire in the stadium's cauldron.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> The Olympic Flame has been lit since the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], but the torch relay did not start until the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. Beginning at the post-[[World War I]] [[1920 Summer Olympics]], the lighting of the Olympic Flame was for 68 years followed by the release of [[dove]]s, symbolizing peace.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> This gesture was discontinued after several doves were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=doves>{{cite web |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20040829084509/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/aug132004/oly5.asp |title=When messengers of peace were burnt alive |accessdate=2007-01-10 |publisher=Deccan Herald |date=2004-08-13}}</ref> However, some Opening Ceremonies have continued to include doves in other forms; for example, the 2002 Winter Olympics featured skaters holding kite-like cloth dove puppets. The 2008 Summer Olympics also included a physical formation of a dove using many people in lighted suits.

=== Closing ===
Various traditional elements also frame the closing ceremonies of an Olympic Games, which take place after all athletic events have concluded. Flag bearers from each participating country enter the stadium in single file, but behind them march all of the athletes without any distinction or grouping of nationality &ndash; a tradition that began at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at the suggestion of Melbourne schoolboy [[John Ian Wing]], who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as "one nation."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/gamesabout.aspx?gt=S&ga=14 |title=Melbourne (Equestrian - Stockholm) 1956 |accessdate=2007-01-10 |publisher=[[British Olympic Association]]}}</ref> (In [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]], the athletes marched in with their countrymen, then dispersed and mingled as the ceremonies went on).

Three national flags are hoisted on flagpoles one at a time while the corresponding national anthems are played: The flag of Greece is raised on the middle pole honoring the birthplace of the Olympic Games, the flag of the host country on the lefthand pole, and then the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games on the righthand pole.<ref>[http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/file_system/attachments/state/attachment_20050531_96390462.pdf www.rfs.nsw.gov.au]</ref> (Exceptionally, in 2004, when the Games were held in Athens, only one Greek flag was raised.)

The president of the host country's Olympic Organising Committee makes a speech, followed by the IOC president, who at the end of his speech formally closes the Olympics, by saying: <blockquote>''I declare the Games of the [ordinal number] Olympiad/[ordinal number] Olympic Winter Games closed and, in accordance with tradition, I call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in [name of host city] to celebrate the Games of the [subsequent ordinal number] Olympiad/[subsequent ordinal number] Olympic Winter Games''.</blockquote> The Olympic Flame is extinguished, and while the Olympic anthem is being played, the Olympic Flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremonies is lowered from the flagpole and carried horizontally from the stadium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_268.pdf|title=Closing Ceremony|publisher=IOC|date=2002-01-31|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>

In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony (because the tradition began in 1920), the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic Flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> The receiving mayor then waves the flag eight times. There are three such flags, differing from all other copies in that they have a six-coloured fringe around the flag, and are tied with six coloured ribbons to a flagstaff:
* '''The Antwerp flag:''' Was presented to the IOC at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] by the city of [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp, Belgium]], and was passed on to the next organising city of the [[Summer Olympics]] until the Games of [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul 1988]].
* '''The Oslo flag:''' Was presented to the IOC at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] by the city of [[Oslo|Oslo, Norway]], and is passed on to the next organising city of the [[Winter Olympics]].
* '''The Seoul flag:''' Was presented to the IOC at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] by the city of [[Seoul|Seoul, The Republic of Korea (South Korea)]]<!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAME TO USE 'REPUBLIC'--> as a replacement for the Antwerp flag that is passed on to the next organising city of the Summer Olympics

This tradition posed a particular challenge at the [[2006 Olympic Winter Games|2006 Winter Games]] in [[Turin, Italy]]. The flag was passed from [[Sergio Chiamparino]], the mayor of Turin, to [[Sam Sullivan]], the mayor of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.  Mayor Sullivan, who is a [[quadriplegic]], waved the flag by holding it in one hand and swinging his motorized wheelchair back and forth eight times.

After these traditional elements, the next host nation introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of that country. This tradition began with the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Games]].  During the Closing Ceremony of the Beijing Games the presentation by [[London]], host of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], featured guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], recording artist [[Leona Lewis]], and footballer [[David Beckham]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7577999.stm|title=London Takes Over as Olympic Host|date=2008-08-24|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.

===Medal presentation===

Usually soon after an Olympic event is completed a medal ceremony is held.  Tradition dictates that a three-tiered rostrum be set up and the bronze and silver medalists stand on their podiums, while the gold medal winner ascends to the highest platform.  The medals are awarded by a member of the IOC<ref>{{cite web |url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-249556/Olympic-Games|title=Olympic Games - the Medal Ceremonies|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.  After medals are awarded, the flags of the nations of the three medalists are raised. The flag of the gold medalist's country is in the center and always raised the highest while the flag of the silver medalist's country is on the left facing the flags and the flag of the bronze medalist's country is on the right, both at lower elevations to the gold medalist's country's flag. The positions of the flags corresponds to the medal winner's positions on the podium.  The flags are all raised while the [[national anthem]] of the gold medalist's country plays<ref name=otraditions>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr03.htm|title=Symbols and Traditions|date=1999-07-12|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.  Citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies.  They aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag bearers<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.sina.com/china/p/1/2008/0718/172118.html|title=Medal Ceremony Hostess Outfits Revealed|date=2008-07-18|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.

== Olympic sports ==
{{main|Olympic sports}}

Currently, the Olympic program consists of 35 different sports, 53 disciplines and more than 400 events. The Summer Olympics includes 28 sports with 38 disciplines and the Winter Olympics includes 7 sports with 15 disciplines.<ref name="Sports">{{cite web |url=http://olympic.org/uk/sports/index_uk.asp |title=Sports |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> Nine sports were on the original Olympic programme in 1896: [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[cycling]], [[fencing]], [[gymnastics]], [[weightlifting]], [[shooting]], [[swimming]], [[tennis]], and [[sport wrestling|wrestling]]. If the 1896 [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] events had not been cancelled due to bad weather, they would have been included in this list as well.<ref name="1896 report">{{cite web |url=http://www.aafla.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1896/1896.pdf |title=The Olympic Games |publisher=[[AAFLA]] |accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

At the most recent Winter Olympics, 15 disciplines in seven sports were featured. Of these, [[cross country skiing]], [[figure skating]], [[ice hockey]], [[Nordic combined]], [[ski jumping]], and [[long track speed skating|speed skating]] have been featured on the programme at all Winter Olympics. In addition, figure skating made it's debut at the [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Summer Olympics of 1908]] and ice hockey was first contested at the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]] before the introduction of a separate Winter Olympics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/winterolympics/2002/features/history.htm|title=Winter Olympic History|date=2002-01-24|publisher=ABC Sports|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>. 

In recent years, the IOC has added several new sports to the programme to attract attention from young spectators. Examples of such sports include [[snowboarding]] and [[beach volleyball]]. There is currently an effort underway to make [[Cricket]] an Olympic sport<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.in.msn.com/cricket/stories/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1609196|title=Waugh backs cricket to become an Olympic sport|date=2008-08-05|publisher=MSN.com|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.  It appears though the growth in the number of sports included at an Olympics has plateaued<ref name=ocharter/>.  The growth of the Olympics also means that some less popular ([[modern pentathlon]]) or expensive (white water [[canoeing]]) sports may lose their place on the Olympic programme. The IOC decided to discontinue [[baseball]] and [[softball]] beginning in 2012.  [[Rugby]] was played in the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] Olympics but was discontinued in 1928<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uidaho.edu/clubs/womens_rugby/RugbyRoot/rugby/FAQ/Trivia/olympics.html|title=Rugby in the Olympics|first=Bill|last=Taylor|date=1993-10-05|publisher=Canterbury University|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.  

Rule 48.1 of the Olympic Charter requires that there be a minimum of 15 Olympic sports at each Summer Games. Following its 114th Session (Mexico 2002), the IOC also decided to limit the programme of the Summer Games to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes. The Olympic sports are defined as those governed by the International Federations listed in Rule 46 of the Olympic Charter. A two-thirds vote of the IOC is required to amend the Charter to promote a Recognised Federation to Olympic status and therefore make the sports it governs eligible for inclusion on the Olympic programme. Rule 47 of the Charter requires that ''only Olympic sports'' may be included in the programme<ref name=ocharter>{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|title=Olympic Charter|date=2007-07-07|publiser=IOC|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.

The IOC reviews the Olympic programme at the first Session following each Olympiad. A simple majority is required for an Olympic sport to be included in the Olympic programme. Under the current rules, an Olympic sport not selected for inclusion in a particular Games remains an Olympic sport and may be included again later with a simple majority. At the [[117th IOC Session]], 26 sports were included in the programme for London 2012<ref name=ocharter/>.

Until 1992, the Olympics also often featured [[demonstration sport]]s. The objective was for these sports to reach a larger audience; 
the winners of these events are not official Olympic champions. 
These sports were sometimes sports popular only in the host nation, 
but internationally known sports have also been demonstrated. 
Some demonstration sports eventually were included as full-medal events.

=== Amateurism and professionalism ===
{{see|Amateurism}}
The ethos of English [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools had a deep involvement in the development of many team sports including all British codes of [[football]] as well as [[cricket]] and [[field hockey|hockey]].  The English public schools of the second half of the 19th century had a major influence on many sports. The schools contributed to the rules and influenced the governing bodies of those sports out of all proportion to their size. They subscribed to the [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Roman]] belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying: ''[[mens sana in corpore sano]]'' &ndash; a sound mind in a healthy body. In this ethos, a [[gentleman]] was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. Class prejudice against "trade" reinforced this attitude. Apart from class considerations there was the typically English concept of "fairness," in which practicing or training was considered as tantamount to cheating. Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a "hobby."

The International Olympic Committee invited a representative of the [[Headmasters' Conference]] (the association of [[headmaster]]s of the English public schools) to attend their early meetings. The Headmasters' Conference chose the [[Reverend]] [[Robert Stuart de Courcy Laffan|Robert Laffan]], the headmaster of [[Cheltenham College]], as their representative to the IOC meetings. He was made a member of the IOC in 1897 and, following the first visit of the IOC to London in 1904, he was central to the founding of the [[British Olympic Association]] a year later.<ref> Steve Baily ''{{PDFlink|[http://www.aafla.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1997/olympika0601d.pdf A Noble Ally and Olympic Disciple: The Reverend Robert S. de Courcy Laffan, Coubertin's 'man' in England]|200&nbsp;KB}}''</ref><ref>Steve Baily ''{{PDFlink|[http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/PDF-Dateien/113-Baily.pdf.

In Coubertin's vision, athletes should be gentlemen. Initially, only amateurs were considered such; [[professional sports#Olympic Games|professional athletes]] were not allowed to compete in the Olympic Games. A short-lived exception was made for professional fencing instructors.<ref>Australian Olympic Committee. "[http://www.olympics.com.au/sports.cfm?SportID=11 Fencing]."</ref>  This exclusion of professionals has caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics.  1912 Olympic [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was disqualified when it was discovered that he played semi-professional [[baseball]] prior to winning his medals. He was restored as champion on compassionate grounds by the IOC in 1983<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017|title=Jim Thorpe Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were considered professionals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1936|title=Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936|publisher=IOC|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.

It gradually became clear to many that the amateurism rules had become outdated.  Due in part to the fact that self-financed amateurs of Western countries often were no match for the state-sponsored "full-time amateurs" of Eastern bloc countries. Nevertheless, the IOC, led by President [[Avery Brundage]], held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism. In the 1970s, after Brundage left, amateurism requirements were dropped from the Olympic Charter, leaving decisions on professional participation to the [[sport governing body|international federation]] for each sport. This switch was perhaps best exemplified by the American [[Dream Team (basketball)|Dream Team]], composed of well-paid [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] stars, which won the Olympic gold medal in [[basketball]] in 1992. As of 2004, the only sports in which no professionals compete is [[boxing]] (though even this requires a definition of amateurism based on fight rules rather than on payment, as some boxers receive cash prizes from their National Olympic Committees); in men's [[football (soccer)]], the number of players over 23 years of age is limited to three per team<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr01.htm|title=Amateurism|date=1999-07-12|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.

Advertisement regulations are still very strict, at least on the actual playing field, although "Official Olympic Sponsors" are common. There have been conflicts at times between individual athlete sponsorship obligations and the official Olympic sponsors.  Athletes are only allowed to have the names of clothing and equipment manufacturers on their outfits. The sizes of these markings are very restricted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/common/asp/download_report.asp?file=en_report_122.pdf&id=122 |title='Advertising, Demonstrations, Propaganda', ''Olympic Charter'', pp98-100 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |author= |date=October 2007|publisher=International Olympic Committee}}</ref>
An example of this comes from the 1992 Basketball team from the United States.  All athletes are required to wear the same uniform on the medal stand when receiving Olympic medals.  The clothing sponsor for that year's Olympic team was [[Reebok]], several of the players had sponsorship obligations that made it impossible for them to display the Reebok logo on camera.  As a result those affected athletes had elected not to participate in the medal ceremony.  In a last-minute solution the athletes were permitted to drape American flags over their shoulders to cover the logos<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportswebconsulting.ca/sportsbabel/2008/03/future-perfect-tense.htm |title='Future Perfect-Tense' |accessdate=2008-08-25 |date=3/1/2008}}</ref>.

[[Image:Beijingolympicsmedals.jpg|thumb|right|The reverse side of the medals of the 2008 Summer Olympics: silver (left), gold (center), bronze (right). Each medal has a ring of [[jade]].]]
The athletes (or teams) who place first, second, or third in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals. (Though they were solid [[gold]] until 1912, after which they were made of [[Gilding|gilded]] silver, though nowadays [[Gold plating|plated]] silver. However, every gold medal must contain at least 6 grams of pure gold<ref name="BeijingOlymp-1">[http://en.beijing2008.cn/67/83/article214028367.shtml Medals of Beijing Olympic Games unveiled], [http://en.beijing2008.cn Beijing 2008 Website] (accessed 12/Aug/2008)</ref>) The runners-up receive [[silver]] medals, and the third-place athletes, [[bronze]] medals. In some events contested by a [[single-elimination tournament]] (most notably [[boxing]]), third place might not be determined, in which case both semi-final losers receive bronze medals. The practice of awarding medals to the top three competitors was introduced in 1904; at the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] only the first two received a medal, silver and bronze, while various prizes were awarded in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]]. However, the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]] also awarded silver trophies for first place.  It was in the Intercalated Games of [[1906 Summer Olympics|Athens 1906]] that the three medal award format was first introduced.  Since the IOC no longer recognizes these games as official Olympic games, the first "official" awarding of the three medals came in the London Olympics of 1908. In addition, from 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth and sixth have received certificates which became officially known as "victory diplomas;" since 1976 the medal winners have received these also, and in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added, presumably to ensure that all losing quarter-finalists in events using single-elimination formats would receive diplomas, thus obviating the need for consolation (or officially, "classification") matches to determine fifth through eighth places (though interestingly these latter are still contested in many elimination events anyway). Certificates were awarded also at the 1896 Olympics, but there they were awarded in addition to the medals to first and second place. Commemorative medals and diplomas&mdash;which differ in design from those referred to above&mdash;are also made available to participants finishing lower than third and eighth respectively. At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, the first three were given [[wreath]]s as well as their medals<ref>{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf|title=The Modern Olympic Games|publisher=The Olympic Museum|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>.  Because the Olympics are held only once every four years, the public and athletes often consider Olympic medals as more important and valuable than world championships and other international tournaments, which are often held annually. Many athletes have become celebrities or heroes in their own country, or even world-wide, after becoming Olympic champions.

The question of which athlete is the most successful of all time is a difficult one to answer.  The diversity of the sports, and the evolution the Olympic Games have undergone since 1896 complicate the matter.  On top of this is the fact that some sports such as [[wrestling]] or [[boxing]] allow the competitor to win only one medal in an Olympics.  It is further complicated by the fact that the IOC no longer recognises the [[Intercalated Games]] which it originally organised. While it may not be the most equitable way to measure success, a list of the most titles won at the Modern Olympic Games by individuals is one way to determine the greatest Olympic athletes of all time.

===Medals per country===
{{See also|All-time Olympic Games medal count}}
The IOC does not publish lists of medals per country, but the media often does. A comparison between countries would be unfair to countries with fewer inhabitants, so some have made calculations of medals per number of inhabitants, such as [http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument] for the 2004 Olympics and [http://simon.forsyth.net/olympics.html] for a few more. A problem here is that for a very small country, gaining just one medal could mean the difference between the very top and the very bottom of the list (a point illustrated by the [[Bahamas]]' per capita number one position in 2004). On the other hand, a large country may not be able to send a number of athletes that is proportional to its size because a limit is set for the number of participants per country for a specific sport. 

A comparison of the total number of medals ''over time'' is further complicated by the fact that the number of times that countries have participated is not equal, and that many countries have gained and lost territories where medal-winning athletes come from. A case in point is the [[USSR]], which not only participated relatively rarely (18 times, versus 45 times for the [[UK]]), but also ceased to exist in 1991. The resulting [[Russian Federation]] is largely, but not entirely, equal to the former USSR. Also, one would have to use population statistics ''at the time''. 

The IOC medal tally chart is based on the number of gold medals for a country.  Where states are equal, the number of silver medals (and then bronze medals) are counted to determine [[Olympic medal rankings|rankings]].
Since 1996, the only countries that have appeared in the top 10 medal tallies for all three subsequent Summer Olympics have been the [[Russian Federation]], [[United States]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Australia]] and [[Italy]].  Since 1994, the only countries that have appeared in the top 10 medal tallies for the subsequent Winter Olympics have been [[Norway]], the [[Russian Federation]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[France]] and [[Italy]].

==Olympic Games host cities==
{{main|List of Olympic host cities}}
<!--******** Mention bidding process! **********-->
By 2010, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 41 cities in 22 countries. The [[2008 Summer Olympics]] have recently concluded in [[Beijing]], and the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] will be held in [[Vancouver]]. The number in parentheses following the city/country denotes how many times that city/country had then hosted the games, with said exclusions.  This table does not include the "Olympic Games" organized by [[Evangelos Zappas]] prior to the IOC's creation in 1894.  It does list the [[1906 Summer Olympics|"Intercalated Games" of 1906]], but the IOC no longer considers them to be official Olympic Games.

''NOTE: The bracketed numbers listed beside the cities and nations are the number of times it has hosted the Games.''
