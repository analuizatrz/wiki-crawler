The '''M62 motorway''' is a west-east [[Pennines|trans-Pennine]] [[motorway]] in northern [[England]], connecting the cities of [[Liverpool]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], and passing the cities of [[Salford]], [[Manchester]], [[Bradford]], [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]]. The road also forms part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|Euroroutes]] [[European route E20|E20]] ([[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon]] to [[Saint Petersburg]]) and [[European route E22|E22]] ([[Holyhead]] to [[Ishim]]). On [[Saddleworth Moor]], it reaches the highest point of any motorway in Britain ({{coord|53.62982|-2.018561|region:GB_type:landmark|name=Saddleworth Moor}}), at 1221 feet (372&nbsp;m) above [[sea level]].<ref name="mtar">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/content/articles/2006/11/30/m62_spencer_feature.shtml|title=More than a road...|author=Spencer Stokes|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[2006-12-01]]|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> The road runs for 107 miles<ref name="mwdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m62/|title=M62 motorway|work=Motorway Database|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>; however, for several miles, it [[Concurrency (road)|shares its route]] with the [[M60 motorway]] around [[Manchester]].

==History==
The concept for the motorway was first proposed in the 1930s. Construction began in 1960 in [[Eccles]], and finished sixteen years later near Tarbock. Adjusted for inflation to 2007, the motorway cost approximately [[GBP|GB£]]765 million to build.<ref name="simmons_consultancy">{{cite paper |author= David Simmons consultancy |title=Case Study:M62 motorway |accessdate=2007-05-30 |url=http://www.davidsimmonds.com/main/pdfs/m62.pdf}} "CEC (1987) estimated that the capital cost of the motorway was "of the order of £412 million at 1985 prices"." The inflation rates are taken from [http://www.whatsthecost.com/historic.cpi.aspx historical CPI figures].</ref>

===Origin of the road===
The origins of the M62 date back to the 1930s, where the need for a route between [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] had been agreed after discussion by the respective highway authorities of the counties.<ref name="mcr">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62ecclesbdy.htm|title=M62: Eccles to county boundary|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> At the same time, it was envisaged that a route between Liverpool and Hull was also needed, connecting the two ports to industrial Yorkshire.<ref name="wry">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62master.htm|title=M62 in West Yorkshire|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

Some years later, after [[World War II]], the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]] appointed engineers to inspect road standards between the [[A580 road]] in [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]] and the [[A1 road]] near [[Selby]].<ref name="wry" /> In 1949, that year's Road Plan for South Lancashire specified the need for the [[dual carriageway|dualling]] and [[grade separation]] of the [[A580 road]], and bypasses of both [[Huyton]] and [[Cadishead]],<ref name="mersey">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62queeccles.htm|title=M62: Queens Drive to Eccles|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> and in 1952, the route for a trans-Pennine motorway, known as '''The [[Lancashire]]-[[Yorkshire]] Motorway''', was laid down, with [[Ferrybridge]] chosen as the eastern terminus rather than Selby.<ref name="wry" /> By the 1960s, however, the proposed dualling of the A580 in Lancashire was considered inadequate, and there was "an urgent need" to link Liverpool to the motorway network.<ref name="mersey" /> The route of the Lancashire-Yorkshire motorway was also considered inadequate as it failed to cater for several industrial towns in Yorkshire.<ref name="wry" /> When James Drake visited the United States in 1962, his experience with the [[Interstate Highway system]] led him to conclude that the '''Merseyside Expressway''' planned only to run between Liverpool and the [[M6 motorway|M6]], would need extending to the [[M63 motorway|Stretford-Eccles Bypass]], thus creating a continuous motorway between Liverpool and [[Ferrybridge]] (a link between Ferrybridge and Hull was not considered until 1964).<ref name="archive_ouse" /> Initially these plans were unpopular and unsupported by the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]], but nevertheless the scheme was added to the Road Plan in 1963.<ref name="mersey" />

===Construction===
====West of Manchester====
Originally, the section of the M62 west of [[Manchester]] was intended to be a separate motorway linking [[Liverpool]] with [[Salford]], but a continuous motorway between [[Leeds]] and Liverpool was deemed to be more feasible,<ref name="pathetic_m52" /><ref name="m602_cbrd">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m602/|title=M602 Motorway|work=Motorway Database|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> known as the '''M52'''. Construction of the motorway between Liverpool and Manchester started in 1971, with the construction of a link between the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and the [[M6 motorway]].<ref name="mersey" /> Concurrently, a contract to link the M6 with Manchester was under way, which required the removal of unsuitable material and drainage of the land. This section was completed in August 1974, creating a continuous link between [[Ferrybridge]] and [[Tarbock]].

The section between Tarbock and Liverpool was the last section of the motorway to be completed, in 1976, due to the difficulties of building an urban motorway. In total, two [[viaduct]]s, ten bridges and seven underpasses had to be constructed to secure the structural integrity of the surrounding residential area. The motorway, however, reached only as far as Queen's Drive (Junction 4), leaving the first three junctions unbuilt.<ref name="mersey" />

====In Greater Manchester====
[[Image:M62 near Irlam, Salford.jpg|thumb|left|The M62 near [[Irlam]], the original eastern terminus, in the [[blue hour|early hours of the morning.]]]]
{{seealso|M60 motorway}}
{{seealso|M63 motorway}}
{{seealso|M602 motorway}}
The first part of the M62 to be built was the Stretford-Eccles Bypass, which now covers junctions 7 to 13 of the [[M60 motorway|M60]].<ref name="pathetic_stretford">{{cite web|title=M62 Stretford-Eccles Bypass|url=http://pathetic.org.uk/lost/m62/|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=Pathetic Motorways}}</ref> Construction started in 1957, and opened in 1960.<ref name="seb">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m63stretecc.htm|title=M63 (now M60) Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Carrington Spur|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=The Motorway Archive}}</ref>

As stated earlier, two separate motorways were planned, with the M52 running from [[Liverpool]] into [[Salford]]; the other, the M62, would link [[Pole Moor]] with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass.<ref name="pathetic_m52">{{cite web|url=http://pathetic.org.uk/lost/m52/|title=M52 Liverpool to Manchester|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher=Pathetic Motorways}}</ref> The section between the interchange with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Salford is now occupied by the [[M602 motorway]].

The Eccles-Pole Moor section was opened in 1971.<ref name="cbrd_m62_timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m62/timeline.shtml|title=M62 - Timeline|publisher=CBRD|work=Motorway Database|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref><ref name="cbrd_m60_timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m60/timeline.shtml|title=M60 - Timeline|publisher=CBRD|work=Motorway Database|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> Of this, the first section to be built was a one-mile extension of the Stretford-Eccles Bypass to [[Worsley]]. Between Eccles and Pole Moor, sixty-seven crossings of the motorway were required, including seven viaducts and eight junctions.<ref name="mcr" />

====Between Saddleworth and Lofthouse====
[[Image:M62 motorway, Calderdale.jpg|thumb|left|The M62 passes [[Scammonden Water]] in [[West Yorkshire]].]]
The first section of the Yorkshire section of the motorway was completed in 1970, between the county boundary on [[Saddleworth Moor]] and [[Outlane]].<ref name="mwdb" /><ref name="polemoor">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62bounpole.htm|title=M62: Boundary to Pole Moor|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=The Motorway Archive}}</ref> The construction of the section between Saddleworth and Pole Moor was a difficult task, given the inhospitable hilly terrain, numerous [[peat bog]]s, and undesirable weather conditions. To build this section of motorway, twelve million [[cubic yard]]s of material was moved, eight million of which were solid rock. 650,000 cubic yards of this material was [[peat]], which had to be cut from the [[rock strata]] and was eventually deposited on hillsides adjacent to the motorway. In addition to the problems caused by removal of the material, the geology of the moors resulted in the engineers needing to split the carriageways for three-quarters of a mile in the middle of this section, sparing Stott Hall Farm from demolition.<ref name="polemoor" /><ref name="bbc_fastlane">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/02/02/020207_insideout_farmhouse_feature.shtml|title=Farming in the fast lane|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2007-02-02]]|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> Two notable bridge constructions were the bridge carrying the [[Pennine Way]], which is curved downwards with 85 foot long [[cantilever]]s, and Scammonden Bridge, often called the longest single-span non-suspension bridge in Britain,<ref name="cbrd-simluator">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/cgi-bin/simu.pl?road=m62w-25|accessdate=2007-05-30|title=M62|work=Motorway Simulator|publisher=CBRD}}</ref> which carries a [[B road]] 120 feet above the motorway.<ref name="polemoor" /> The mile-long section between Pole Moor and Outlane suffered fewer problems, with the summer weather being satisfactory.<ref name="pmtool">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62poleoutl.htm|title=M62: Pole Moor to Outlane|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=The Motorway Archive}}</ref> Concurrently, a section of the motorway was being built between [[Gildersome]] and [[Lofthouse, West Yorkshire|Lofthouse]],<ref name="mwdb" /> resulting in the demolition of a significant proportion of the village of [[Tingley]] to build the eponymous interchange.

====Between the M1 and A1====
Two contracts were awarded for the section of the M62 between [[Lofthouse]] and [[Ferrybridge]] in 1972, and both were completed in 1974.<ref name="archive_2931">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62lofthope.htm|title=M62: Lofthouse to Hopetown|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref><ref name="archive_3133">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62hopeferry.htm|title=M62: Hopetown to Ferrybridge|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> On the first contract, care was needed at the crossing of the [[River Calder]] due to the [[alluvial]] bedrock, while, on the second, precautions were taken as the length was built on old [[coal mining|coal mine]] workings.

====East of Ferrybridge====
[[Image:Ouse bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]] bridge, from the floodplain adjacent to the river.]]
The sections between Ferrybridge and [[North Cave]] were of the last sections of the motorway to be conceived<ref name="archive_ouse" /> and built.<ref name="cbrd_m62_timeline" /> One of the most notable features is the bridge crossing the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] west of [[Goole]], a structure nearly one mile long, rising to thirty meters above ground level, which commenced construction in January 1973. 

The bridge was delayed due to "steel supplies [being] a chronic headache"<ref name="nce">{{Citation|last = Hayward|first = David|newspaper = New Civil Engineer|date = [[1975-08-14]]}}</ref> and a partial collapse of the framework, caused by bolts joining a cross-beam to a trestle shearing.<ref name="archive_ouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m62goolouse.htm|title=M62: Goole - Ouse Bridge|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> The problems with the Ouse Bridge pushed the opening of the whole section east of [[Goole]] back to May 1976.<ref name="cbrd_m62_timeline" /><ref name="archive_ouse" />

===Incidents===
====Coach bombing====
{{main|M62 coach bombing}}
On [[4 February]] [[1974]], a bomb was detonated on a coach containing off duty [[British Army|army personnel]] and family members,  between Chain Bar (Junction 26) and Gildersome (Junction 27), resulting in the deaths of 12 people and injuries in 38 other people. The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] were deemed responsible for the attacks.<ref name="coach">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,634024,0.html|title=Miscarriages of justice|date=[[2002-01-15]]|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=''[[Guardian Unlimited]]''}}</ref>

====Rail crash====
{{main|Selby rail crash}}
On [[28 February]] [[2001]], at 06:13 [[GMT]], Gary Hart, a [[sleep deprivation|sleep-deprived]] driver, swerved off the M62 onto the [[East Coast Main Line]] near [[Selby]]. While Hart was calling the [[emergency services]], a [[GNER]] southbound train collided with Hart's [[Land Rover]], and subsequently derailed into the path of an oncoming [[freight train]]. 10 people, including the train drivers, were killed, and a further 82 were injured.

===Development after opening===
[[Image:A1(M) and M62 interchange.jpg|thumb|left|Junction 32a during construction in [[September 2005]].]]
After its completion, the M62 experienced no major changes until 2000, when the section of the M62 between Eccles Interchange and Simister Interchange (junctions 12 to 18) was renamed to the [[M60 motorway|M60]] in 2000.<ref name="cbrd_m60">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m60/|title=M60|work=Motorway Database|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

Since its opening, two new junctions were opened - in December 2002, the previously missing Junction 8 was opened to allow access to the [[A574 road|A574]] and a new retail park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.costain.com/news/bpfeb03/newsindepth8.htm|title=M62 junction completion raises region's economic prospects|publisher=[[Costain Group]]|date=2003|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>, while in January 2006, Junction 32a was opened, to link the motorway with the recently upgraded [[A1 road|A1(M)]].<ref name="hwa_newsletter">{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/n050282_F_HM_NEWSLETTER.pdf|title=A1(M) Ferrybridge to Hook Moor open to Traffic - January 2006|publisher=[[Highways Agency]]|date=2005|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

In 2007, the UK's first [[High occupancy vehicle lane|car-sharing lane]] on a motorway will be opened at Junction 26, allowing any eastbound traffic from the [[M606 motorway|M606]] with more than one occupant to use the lane.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/4822808.stm|title=First car-share lane to be built|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2006-03-20]]|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>. Additionally, plans to widen the motorway to four lanes between Junctions 25 and 28 to reduce congestion are in the planning stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge/10575.aspx|title=M1 and M62 Motorway Improvements in Yorkshire|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

==Stott Hall Farm==

On Windy Hill, near the highest point of the motorway, the road divides into two to negotiate the hilly terrain, and Stott Hall Farm ({{coord|53.641599|-1.952222|region:GB_type:landmark|name=Stott Hall Farm}}), and its 18th-century cottage, is situated in between the two halves.<ref name="bbc_fastlane" /><ref name="life_fastlane" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=topn&cat=7|title=Motorways M60 to M69 - Most viewed|work=Photo gallery|publisher=[[SABRE]]|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref>. The road forks around the farm for engineering reasons, though a [[Urban legend|local myth]] persists that the road had to be split because the owners refused to sell the land during its construction.<ref name="bbc_fastlane" /> The farm is often nicknamed as "the [[Little House on the Prairie]]".<ref name="bbc_fastlane" />

The previous tenants, Ken and Beth Wild, lived and worked there since [[1971]].<ref name="life_fastlane">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/features/2003/m62.shtml|title=Life in the Fast Lane|date=[[2002-05-24]]|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[[BBC]] [[West Yorkshire]]}}</ref>  The farm is now occupied by Paul Thorp.<ref name="bbc_fastlane" />

==References in music==

The M62 motorway is mentioned in a number of songs. One of the earliest songs is "Driving Away From Home (Jim's Tune)" by [[It's Immaterial]], a 1986 song which described the motorway as a way of getting to Manchester from the band's hometown of Liverpool. "The Snake", a song from the album ''[[Secrets (Human League album)|Secrets]]'' by [[The Human League]], discusses the road as an alternative route to [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] from the [[Snake Pass]], the main subject of the song.  It suggests the [[A628 road|A628]] as another alternative.

More generally, "[[It's Grim Up North]]", by [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]], released in 1991, consisted of a list of towns and cities on or near the M62 in the "grim North", in addition to the motorway itself. [[Doves]] named a song after the M62 on their 2002 album ''[[The Last Broadcast (album)|The Last Broadcast]]'', which is stated in the sleeve notes to be written "under the M62 flyover at [[Northenden]]". "The Man Who Lives On The M62" by [[Graham Fellows|John Shuttleworth]] and "Tradition" by [[Kathryn Williams]] refer not to the motorway itself but to Stott Hall Farm.  Shuttleworth compares his emotions of sorrow and loneliness to those of the inhabitants of the farm, while Williams uses the urban legend of the owner's refusal to sell the farm as an example of tradition.

==Traffic==
[[Image:M62 traffic statistics.svg|660px|center|1999-2006 traffic flow graph.]]
