Tel Aviv was founded in 1909 on the outskirts of [[Jaffa]] ({{lang-he|יפו}}, ''Yafo''), believed to be the oldest port in the world. The growth of Tel Aviv soon outpaced Jaffa, which was largely Arab at the time. Tel Aviv and Jaffa were merged into a single municipality in 1950, two years after the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|establishment of the State of Israel]]. Tel Aviv was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2003 due to its large collection of [[Bauhaus]] buildings, the largest concentration in the world.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1096/documents/ | title=Unesco White City of Tel-Aviv -- the Modern Movement | accessdate=2008-02-15 | publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}</ref><ref name="times">{{cite news | url=http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/holiday_type/breaks/article3370349.ece | title=Hip and happening in Tel Aviv | work=The Times | date=2008-02-16 | accessdate=2008-02-16 | last=Strimpel | first=Zoe}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Tel Aviv'' (literally "Hill of Spring") was chosen in 1910 out of many suggestions, among them "Herzliya". Tel Aviv was the Hebrew title of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s book ''Altneuland'' ("Old New Land"), translated from the [[German language|German]] by [[Nahum Sokolow]]. Sokolow took the name from the [[Book of Ezekiel]]: "Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days."<ref name="Ezekiel_315">{{citeweb | url=http://king-james-bible.classic-literature.co.uk/the-book-of-the-prophet-ezekiel/ebook-page-03.asp | title=The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel | publisher=''King James Bible'' | accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>
This name was found fitting as it embraced the idea of the renaissance of the ancient Jewish homeland. ''Aviv'' is Hebrew for "spring", symbolizing renewal, and ''tel'' is an archeological site that reveals layers of civilization built one over the other.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/Telaviv.html | title=Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-18 | publisher=''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]''}}</ref> 

Theories vary about the etymology of Jaffa or ''Yafo'' in Hebrew. Some theorists believe that the name derives from ''yafah'' or ''yofi'', Hebrew for "beautiful" or "beauty". Another tradition is that [[Japheth]], son of [[Noah]], founded the city and that it was named for him. The city of Jaffa is mentioned in the [[Book of Jonah]], and an Egyptian clay tablet discovered at Tel el-[[Amarna]], believed to be a tax register, is inscribed with the name "Japo".<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israelmybeloved.com/channel/israel_today/section/cities_towns | title=Cities & Towns:Israel Today | quote=The name Yafo comes from the name of Noah's son Japheth, or Yafet | accessdate=2007-07-18 | publisher=Israelmybeloved.com}}</ref><ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.joppadesign.com/joppa.html | title=What does Joppa mean? | accessdate=2007-07-18 | publisher=Joppa Design | quote=Joppa, meaning beautiful in Greek, was the word that seemed to fit.}}</ref>

===Jaffa===

[[Image:TelAviv-Founding.jpg|thumb|Tel Aviv was founded on land purchased from Bedouins north of the existing city of Jaffa. This photograph is of the 1909 auction of the first lots.]]
Jaffa has been a fortified port town for at least 4,000&nbsp;years and is believed to be the oldest port in the world.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/geo/jaffa.html | title=Jaffa | accessdate=2008-02-11 | publisher=''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]''}}</ref> The city is first mentioned in letters from 1470 BCE that record its conquest by Egyptian [[Pharaoh]], [[Thutmose III]].<ref name="Economist" /> In the [[Bible]], Jaffa is the city where the prophet [[Jonah]] set sail for [[Tarshish]] and was swallowed by a great fish.<ref>Jonah 1:3</ref> In the [[Book of Joshua]] Jaffa is described as bordering on the territory of the [[Tribe of Dan]].<ref name="joshua">Joshua 19:40–48</ref> The city has since changed hands more than 20&nbsp;times and was destroyed by the [[Mamelukes]] in 1345. In the 16th century, Jaffa fell under [[Ottoman]] rule and was destroyed by [[Napoleon]] in 1799.<ref name="Economist" />

During the mid-19th century, the city experienced great prosperity via trade with [[Europe]], especially in silk and [[Jaffa orange]]s.<ref name="Economist" /> Since it was the gateway to [[Jerusalem]], many immigrants passed through the city but most settled in Jerusalem.<ref name="Economist" /> In 1860, the small [[Sephardic]] community in Jaffa was joined by Jews from [[Morocco]] and small numbers of European [[Ashkenazi]] Jews.<ref name="Economist" /> In the 1870s, the old city walls were razed to allow for expansion.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/944906.html | title=Archaeological discoveries may prove barrier to Jaffa port rejuvenation | accessdate=2008-01-21 | date-2008-01-15 | work=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref> By 1882 Jaffa’s Jews numbered more than 1,500; meanwhile, the total population of the town grew from 2,500 in 1806 to 17,000 in 1886.<ref name="Economist" />
[[Image:TelAviv-paam4.jpg|thumb|left|Early Tel Aviv]]

During the 1880s, Ashkenazi immigration to Jaffa increased with the onset of the [[First Aliyah]]. These immigrants were motivated by [[Zionism]] more than religion. They came to farm the land and engage in productive labor.<ref name="Economist" /> In keeping with their pioneer ideology, some chose to settle in the sand dunes north of Jaffa.<ref name="Economist" /> The neighborhood of [[Neve Tzedek]] was founded in 1887, and Neve Shalom, in 1897.<ref name="Economist" />

===Ahuzat Bayit===
[[Image:Tel Aviv foundations memorial.JPG|thumb|"I will build thee, and thou shalt be built" – a memorial to the founders of Tel Aviv on [[Rothschild Boulevard]]]]
The [[Second Aliyah]] led to further expansion.<ref name="Economist" /> In 1906, a group of Jews, among the residents of Jaffa, banded together to build a new [[:Category:Garden suburbs|garden suburb]] on the outskirts of Jaffa.<ref name="JewishVL>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/geo/tahist.html | title=From Spring Hill to Independence | publisher=''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]'' | accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref> [[Arthur Ruppin]], one of the members of [[Ahuzat Bayit]] (lit. "Homestead"), as it was called, defined its goal as building a   “Hebrew urban centre in a healthy environment, planned according to the rules of aesthetics and modern hygiene”.<ref name="Economist" /> In 1908, the group purchased {{convert|5|ha|acre|}} of dunes northeast of Jaffa which were divided into 60&nbsp;plots. Another member of Ahuzat Bayit was [[Meir Dizengoff]], who went on to become head of the Tel Aviv local council in 1911, and later, the city's first mayor.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/BIOS/dizen.html | title=Dizengoff, Meir | publisher=[[Jewish Agency]] | accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book

===Expulsion of Jews===
By 1914, Tel Aviv had grown to include more than {{convert|100|ha|acre|0}}, including several new neighborhoods.<ref name="JewishVL" /> However, growth halted in 1917 when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities expelled the Jews of Jaffa.<ref name="JewishVL" /> A report published in ''The New York Times'' by United States Consul Garrels in Alexandria, Egypt described the Jaffa deportation of early April 1917.<ref name=Turkish>{{cite web | last = Boston | first = Andrew G. | title = Under Turkish Rule, Part I| publisher = FrontPageMagazine.com | date = 2008 | url = http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID={68314118-6D77-4E06-B4D5-282AF4285BC9}| accessdate = 2008-02-10 }}</ref>The orders of evacuation were aimed chiefly at the Jewish population. Muslims and Christians who had permits were allowed to remain. On [[April 1]], [[1917]], on the orders of [[Jemal Pasha]], the Jews were ordered to leave the country within 48 hours. Seven thousand Jews were evicted from their homes, which were looted by the Arab residents. No property was allowed to be taken with them, and two Jews were hanged on the outskirts of Tel Aviv as an example to anyone who considered resistance. Many Jews were found murdered in the orchards.<ref name=Turkish />

===Under the British Mandate===
Under [[British Mandate of Palestine|British administration]], the political friction between Jews and Arabs in [[Palestine]] increased. On [[May 1]] [[1921]], the [[Jaffa Riots]] erupted and an Arab mob killed dozens of Jewish residents. In the wake of this violence, many Jews left Jaffa for Tel Aviv, bringing the population of Tel Aviv to 35,000 by 1924.<ref name="population">{{citeweb | url=http://www.travelnet.co.il/israel/TelAviv/History.htm | title=Tel Aviv History | accessdate=2008-01-20 | publisher=Travelnet.co.il}}</ref> New businesses opened in Tel Aviv, leading to the decline of Jaffa as a commercial center.<ref name="JewishVL" />  In 1925, [[Patrick Geddes]] drew up a [[Urban planning|master plan]] for Tel Aviv, which was adopted by the city council led by Meir Dizengoff.<ref name="Economist" />

[[Image:Rothschild Boulevard.jpg|thumb|[[Rothschild Boulevard]], one of Tel Aviv's historic streets]]

Tel Aviv continued to grow in 1926 but suffered an economic setback in 1927&ndash;30.<ref name="JewishVL" /><ref name="Economist" /> At the same time, cultural life was given a boost by the establishment of the Ohel Theater and the decision of [[Habima Theatre]] to make Tel Aviv its permanent base in 1931.<ref name="JewishVL" /> Tel Aviv gained municipal status in 1934.<ref name="JewishVL" />

The population rose dramatically during the [[Fifth Aliyah]] when the Nazis came to power in Germany.<ref name="JewishVL" /> As the Jews fled Europe, many settled in Tel Aviv, bringing the population in 1937 to 150,000, compared to Jaffa's 69,000&nbsp;residents. Within two years, it had reached 160,000, which was over a third of the country's total Jewish population.<ref name="JewishVL" /> Many new immigrants remained after disembarking in Jaffa, turning the city into a center of urban life. In the wake of the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936&ndash;39 Arab rioting]], a local port independent of Jaffa was built in 1938, and [[Lod Airport]] (later Ben Gurion Airport) and [[Sde Dov Airport]] opened between 1937 and 1938.<ref name="Economist" />

Tel Aviv's [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]], now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], emerged in the 1930s. Many of the German Jewish architects trained at the [[Bauhaus]], the [[Modernist]] school of architecture closed by the Nazis in 1933, fled Germany. Some came to Palestine and adapted the architectural outlook of the Bauhaus school to local conditions, creating the largest concentration of buildings in the [[International Style]] in the world.  <ref name="Economist" />

[[Image:OldcityhallS.jpg|thumb|right|Historic Tel Aviv town hall and [[Nahum Gutman]] fountain on [[Bialik]] Street]]

According to the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|1947 UN Partition Plan]] that proposed dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states,  Tel Aviv, by then a city of 230,000, was slated for inclusion in the Jewish state. Jaffa was designated as part of the Arab state. The Arabs, however, rejected the partition plan. <ref name="Economist" /> Between 1947 and 1948, tensions grew on the border between Tel Aviv and Jaffa, with Arab snipers firing at Jews from the minaret of the local mosque. The [[Haganah]] and [[Irgun]] retaliated with a seige on Jaffa.<ref name="Economist" /> From  April 1948, the Arab residents began to leave. When Jaffa was conquered by Israeli forces on [[May 14]], few remained.<ref name="Economist" />

===After Israeli independence=== 
By the time of Israel's [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Declaration of Independence]] on [[May 14]] [[1948]], the population of Tel Aviv had risen to more than 200,000.<ref name="population" />
Throughout the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], Tel Aviv served as Israel's temporary capital because of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|Arab blockade of Jerusalem]], which was named the capital in December 1949.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/SLSES/donors/eng_articles/index.html |title=Provisional capital of Israel | accessdate=2008-01-21 | publisher=University of Maryland Libraries}}</ref> Because of the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most foreign embassies stayed in or near Tel Aviv.

Tel Aviv has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with hot summers, pleasant springs and autumns, and mild, somewhat rainy winters ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). Humidity tends to be high year-round due to the city's proximity to the sea.

===Districts===
{{see|Neighborhoods of Tel Aviv}}
Tel Aviv is made up of nine districts that have formed naturally over the city's short history. The most notable of these is Jaffa, the ancient port city out of which Tel Aviv grew. This area is traditionally made up demographically of a greater percentage of Arabs, but recent [[gentrification]] is finding them replaced by a young professional population. Similar processes are occurring in nearby [[Neve Tzedek]], the original Jewish neighborhood outside of Jaffa. [[Ramat Aviv]], a neighborhood in the northern part of the city largely made up of luxury apartments, is currently undergoing extensive expansion and is set to absorb the beachfront property of Sde Dov Airport after its decommissioning.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3420369,00.html | title=Tel Aviv airport to make way for luxury project | accessdate=2007-07-03 | date=2007-07-03 | last=Petersburg | first=Ofer | work=Ynetnews}}</ref>

Historically, there has been a demographic split between the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] north of the city, including the neighborhood of Ramat Aviv, and the southern, more [[Middle-Eastern]] neighborhoods including Neve Tzedek and [[Florentine, Tel Aviv|Florentin]]. Recently, however, gentrification and soaring real estate prices have reduced the divide.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://guides.travelchannel.com/tel-aviv/city-guides/district-guide | title=District Guide | accessdate=2008-01-26 | publisher=TravelChannel.com}}</ref>

===Architecture===

[[Image:106 Rothschild Boulevard by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|Bauhaus architecture on Rothschild Boulevard]]
Apart having over 5,000 Bauhaus buildings, the largest concentration in the world, which have been declared protected landmarks, Tel Aviv <ref>{{citeweb | url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=1096 | title=White City of Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}</ref><ref name="times" /><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.telavivfoundation.org/about_tel_aviv.htm | title=About the Tel Aviv Foundation | accessdate=2008-02-13 | publisher=Tel Aviv Foundation}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/Architecture/Bauhaus.html | title=Bauhaus Architecture | publisher=''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]'' | accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> has become a hub of modern [[high-rise]] architecture due to the soaring price of real-estate. The [[Shalom Meir Tower|Shalom Tower]], Israel's first skyscraper, was built in Tel Aviv in 1965, and remained the country's tallest building until 1999.  The [[Azrieli Center]], composed of three buildings&mdash; one square, one triangular, and one circular&mdash;usurped that title. Since 2001, Israel's tallest building is the  [[Moshe Aviv Tower|City Gate Tower]] in [[Ramat Gan]]. Recent additions to Tel Aviv's skyline are the [[Neve Tzedek Tower]], [[Tzameret Towers]], and [[YOO Towers]] designed by [[Phillipe Stark]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=100280 | title=Tel Aviv-Yaffo Buildings | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Emporis}}</ref>

==Demographics==

==Economy==
[[Image:Azrieli Towers.jpg|thumb|[[Azrieli Center]] towers and mall]]
Since Tel Aviv was built on sand dunes, farming was not profitable and maritime commerce was centered in [[Haifa]] and [[Ashdod]]. Instead, the city gradually developed as a center for scientific and technical research. In 1974, [[Intel]] opened its first overseas research and development operation in Israel, and Tel Aviv emerged as a high-tech center in the 1990s.<ref name="Economist" />

The economy of Tel Aviv has developed dramatically over the past decades. The city has been described as a flourishing technological center by ''[[Newsweek]]'' and a "miniature [[Los Angeles]]" by ''[[The Economist]]''.<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite journal| last=Levy | first=Stephen | coauthors=Matt Rees | title= "Focus on Technology: The Hot New Tech Cities" | journal=[[Newsweek]] | date=1998-11-09 | accessdate=2008-02-15}} <!-- (online: 1998-11-04) "Massive immigration from Russia in the early 90s brought the country a flood of computer scientists with advanced theoretical knowledge." --></ref><ref name="Economist">{{cite journal | url=http://www.economist.com/cities/findStory.cfm?city_id=TLV&folder=Facts-Figures#Economic_profile | title=Tel Aviv City Guide | accessdate=2007-05-28 | journal=[[The Economist]]}}</ref> Many computer scientists, their numbers increased by immigration from the former Soviet Union since the early 1990s, live and work in Tel Aviv.

Since then, high-tech industry in the Tel Aviv area has developed even more.<ref name="Newsweek" /> The Tel Aviv metropolitan area (including satellite cities such as [[Herzliya]] and [[Petah Tikva]]) is Israel's center of high-tech, and is sometimes referred to as [[Silicon Wadi]].<ref name="Newsweek"/> Tel Aviv has been ranked as the most expensive city in the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.jhtml?idContent=1268475|title=Worldwide Cost of Living Survey 2007 – city rankings|publisher=[[Mercer Human Resource Consulting]] |date=2007-06-18 | accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref>

===Museums===
[[Image:Henry Moore, Tel aviv.JPG|thumb|left|Sculpture by [[Henry Moore]] outside the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]

Israel is claimed to have the highest number of museums per capita of any country, three of the largest of which are in Tel Aviv.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israeliconsulatela.org/culture/Science.asp | title=Science & Technology | publisher=Consulate General of Israel in Los Angeles | accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.visit-tlv.co.il/eng.html | title=Museums and Galleries | publisher=Visit-tlv.co.il | accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Governing Israel: Chosen People, Promised Land and Prophetic Tradition  |last=Sharkansky |first=Ira |year=2005 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=0765802775 |pages=22 }}</ref>  Among the most notable are the [[Eretz Israel Museum]], known for its rich collection of archaeology and history exhibits dealing with the [[Land of Israel]], and the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]], one of the major art museums in Israel. Housed on the campus of [[Tel Aviv University]] is the [[Beth Hatefutsoth]], a museum of the international Jewish diaspora. Containing both historical documents and art, the museum tells the story of Jewish prosperity and persecution throughout the [[Jewish diaspora|centuries of exile]]. Batey Haosef Museum is a showcase of the [[Israel Defense Forces]]' military history, containing rare exhibits and authentic pieces from Israel's history as well as a wide variety of firearms and pictures. The [[Palmach|Palmach Museum]] near Tel Aviv University gives visitors a multimedia experience of the history of the Palmach as well as vast archives depicting the lives of young self-trained Jewish soldiers who became Israel's first defenders. Near [[Charles Clore]]'s garden in north Jaffa is a small museum of the [[Irgun|Etzel]] Jewish militant organization, one of the achievements of which was conquering Jaffa for Israel in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. The [[Tel Aviv Exhibition Centre|Tel Aviv Exhibition Center]] in the northern part of the city hosts more than 60&nbsp;major events every year. Many offbeat museums and galleries are in the city's artsy southern areas, including the Tel Aviv Raw Art contemporary art gallery.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/English/culture/museums/index.htm | title=Treasure of the State | accessdate=2008-01-26 | publisher=Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality}}</ref><ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/English/culture/museums/list.htm | title=The Museums of Tel-Aviv-Jaffa | accessdate=2008-01-26 | publisher=Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality}}</ref>

===Sports===
[[Image:NokiaArena.jpg|thumb|Tel Aviv's [[Nokia Arena]]]]
Tel Aviv is home to some of the top sports teams in Israel, including a world-class basketball team. It is the only city with three&nbsp;teams in the [[Israeli football]] (soccer) premier league. [[Maccabi Tel Aviv|Maccabi Tel Aviv Sports Club]] was founded in 1906 and competes in more than 10&nbsp;sports. Its [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv Basketball Club]] holds 47&nbsp;Israeli titles, has won 36&nbsp;editions of the Israel cup, and has five&nbsp;European Championships, and its [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.]] holds 18&nbsp;Israeli league titles and has won 22&nbsp;editions of the Israel cup,  two&nbsp;Israel Toto cups and two&nbsp;Asia cups. Yael Arad, an athlete in Maccabi's [[judo]] club, won a silver medal in the 1992 [[Olympic Games]].<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=ARADYAE01 | title=Yael Arad | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Olympic Database}}</ref>

[[Hapoel Tel Aviv]] Sports Club was founded in 1923 and has included more than 11&nbsp;sports clubs<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/il@hapta.html | title=Hapoel Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Fotw.net}}</ref> including the [[Hapoel Tel Aviv B.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv Basketball Club]] (five&nbsp;Israeli championships, four&nbsp;Israeli cups) and the [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv Football Club]] (13&nbsp;Israeli championships, 11&nbsp;Israeli cups, one&nbsp;Toto cup and one&nbsp;Asia champion), a kayaking club, and a women's basketball club.

[[Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.|Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv]]'s football club (once Israeli champion, twice Israeli cup holder and twice Israeli Toto cup holder) is the only Israeli football team in the top division (''Ligat Ha'al'') that represents a neighborhood&mdash;''Shechunat Hatikva'' ("The Hope Neighborhood") in Tel Aviv&mdash;and not a city.

Other football clubs in the top division were [[Shimshon Tel Aviv F.C.|Shimshon Tel Aviv]] and [[Beitar Tel Aviv F.C.|Beitar Tel Aviv]], which has merged into one team, [[Beitar/Shimshon Tel Aviv F.C.|Beitar/Shimshon Tel Aviv]], in the third division, [[Liga Artzit]]. Another former first division team, [[Maccabi Jaffa F.C.|Maccabi Jaffa]], played in the lower divisions in the [[2007/08 in Israeli football|2007&ndash;08 season]].

Two [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs operate in Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv Rowing Club, established as early as 1935 on the banks of the Yarkon River, is the largest rowing club in Israel.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.rowersalmanac.com/profiles/israel.asp | title=Rowers Almanac | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Rowersalmanac.com}}</ref> Meanwhile, the beaches of Tel Aviv provide a vibrant [[Matkot]] (beach paddleball) scene.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.telaviv-insider.co.il/sports.php | title=Sports in the Tel-Aviv | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Tel Aviv Insider}}</ref> [[Tel Aviv Lightning]] represent Tel Aviv in the [[Israel Baseball League]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stljewishlight.com/topstories/12348156495807.php | title=Israel Baseball League starts in June | work=[[St. Louis]] Jewish Light | accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
[[Image:Kirya bridge Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|Multimodal traffic in Tel Aviv: pedestrians, private cars, buses, trucks, taxis and train station]]

Many major routes of the national road network pass through or end in Tel Aviv, a transportation hub. The main road access route to Tel Aviv is the [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway (Highway 20)]], which runs along the eastern side of the city from north to south along the Ayalon River riverbed, dividing for the most part Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan. Driving south on the Ayalon gives access to [[Highway 1 (Israel)|Highway 1]], leading to [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and Jerusalem. Within the city, the main routes are King George Street, [[Allenby Street]], [[Ibn Gabirol Street]], [[Dizengoff Street]], [[Rothschild Boulevard]], and in Jaffa the main route is Jerusalem Boulevard. Namir Road connects the city to [[Highway 2 (Israel)|Highway 2]], Israel's main north–south highway, and Begin/Jabotinsky Road, which provides access from the east through Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Petah Tiqva. Tel Aviv, accommodating about 500,000&nbsp;commuter cars daily, suffers from increasing congestion. In 2007, the Sadan Report recommended the introduction of a [[Road pricing|congestion charge]] similar to that of [[London]] in Tel Aviv as well as other Israeli cities. Under this plan, road users travelling into the city would pay a fixed fee.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1198517321459 | title=Public transportation to be overhauled | accessdate=2008-01-27 | work=[[Jerusalem Post]] | date=2008-08-01 | last=Wrobel | first=Sharon }}</ref> Tel Aviv Municipality are trying to encourage the use of bicycles in the city, aiming to open 100&nbsp;bicycle-rental stations to serve {{convert|74|km|mi|1|sp=us}} of bicycle paths.

[[Image:Littleuni 13.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway]] on Tel Aviv eastern border]]

Tel Aviv has four [[Israel Railways|train stations]] along the Ayalon Highway. The stops are from north to south: Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv Merkaz, Tel Aviv Hashalom (near [[David Azrieli|Azrieli]] Center shopping mall) and Tel Aviv Hahaganah (near the [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]]). It is estimated that more than a million&nbsp;people travel by train from the surrounding cities to Tel Aviv each month.

Tel-Aviv has two central bus stations: 'The old central bus station' and 'The new central bus station'.
The new [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]] is in the south of the city. The main bus network in Tel Aviv is operated by [[Dan Bus Company]]; the [[Egged Bus Cooperative]], the world's second-largest bus company, provides intercity transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/11/Facets%20of%20the%20Israeli%20Economy-%20Transportation |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |title=Facets of the Israeli Economy &ndash; Transportation |date=[[2001-11-01]] |last=Solomon |first=Shoshanna |accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref>

Tel Aviv's domestic airport is [[Sde Dov]] in the northwestern part of the city. Sde Dov is slated to close because it occupies prime coastal real estate near the upscale Ramat Aviv neighborhood.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/793988.html | title=Sde Dov to be vacated, state gets half of Big Bloc | accessdate=2007-07-17 | work=[[Haaretz]] | last=Bar-Eli |first=Avi| date=[[2006-11-30]]}}</ref> In the near future all services to Sde Dov will transfer to [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], Israel's main international airport, close to the city of [[Lod]] and {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} southeast of Tel Aviv. Because it is close to Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport is often referred to as ''Tel Aviv International Airport'' even though it is not part of any municipal jurisdiction.

In early 2008, Tel Aviv Municipality announced a pilot scheme to build charging stations for electric cars. Initially, five&nbsp;charging points will be built, and eventually 150&nbsp;points will be set up across the city as part of the Israeli electric car project, [[Project Better Place]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000299280&fid=942 | title=Tel Aviv commits to electric car | accessdate=2008-01-17 | date=2008-01-17 | work=Globes}}</ref> Furthermore, battery replacement points will be located at the city's entrances.

==Media==
The three largest newspapers in Israel are published in Tel Aviv. Tabloid ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' has been Israel's most widely circulated newspaper since the 1970s and is headquartered on Begin Road.<ref name="news">{{citeweb | url=http://www.abyznewslinks.com/israe.htm | title=Israel Newspapers | accessdate=2008-01-31 | publisher=Abzynewslinks.com}}</ref> ''[[Maariv]]'', Israel's second most popular tabloid, is also published in the city, while ''[[Haaretz]]'', Israel's most popular broadsheet, is based in the city.<ref name="news" /> Tel Aviv also acts as the base for other national press including the evening financial newspaper ''[[Globes]]'', the weekly newspaper ''[[HaTzofe]]'', and the daily newspaper ''[[Makor Rishon]]''.<ref name="news" /> ''[[Iton Tel Aviv]]'' and the weekly ''[[Zman Tel Aviv]],'' report local news.<ref name="news" /> More recently, the free daily ''[[Israel Post]]'' and ''[[Israeli (newspaper)|Israeli]]'' have been produced in the city. Several radio stations cover the Tel Aviv area, including the city-based Radio Tel Aviv.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.mondotimes.com/1/world/il/235/4739 | title=Tel Aviv Israel news media | accessdate=2008-01-31 | publisher=Mondotimes.com}}</ref>

==Terrorism==
Tel Aviv has suffered from violence and terrorism by [[:Category:Palestinian militant groups|Palestinian militant groups]] for many years. The first [[suicide attack]] in Tel Aviv occurred on [[October 19]], [[1994]], on the [[Tel Aviv bus 5 massacre|Line 5 bus]], when a bomber killed himself and 21 civilians as part of a [[Hamas]] suicide campaign. This was followed on [[March 4]], [[1996]], during [[Purim]] holiday festivities by a suicide bombing that killed 18&nbsp;civilians near an [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) at the Dizengoff Center. Оn [[June 1]], [[2001]], during the [[Second Intifada]], a suicide bomb exploded inside a nightclub called the [[Dolphinarium massacre|Dolphi Disco]], and 21 were killed and more than 100 were injured. Twenty people were killed on [[January 25]], [[2002]], in a suicide attack near the old Central Bus Station, and on [[January 5]], [[2003]], in two nearly simultaneous attacks, 23 were killed. On [[April 17]], [[2006]], 10&nbsp;people, many of them foreign laborers, were killed and dozens wounded in another suicide attack in the same location.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.adl.org/Israel/israel_attacks.asp | title=Major Terrorist Attacks in Israel | accessdate=2007-07-19 | publisher=Anti-Defamation League}}</ref> However, lately things have calmed down and city has started again hosting many tourists and even more annual events.

==Sister cities==
Tel Aviv is [[town twinning|twinned]] with 25 cities and has a partnership with [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]]:<ref name="twinning">{{citeweb | url=http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/Cityhall/TwinCities/Index.asp | title= Tel Aviv sister cities | accessdate=2008-01-19 | publisher=Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality | language=Hebrew}}</ref>
