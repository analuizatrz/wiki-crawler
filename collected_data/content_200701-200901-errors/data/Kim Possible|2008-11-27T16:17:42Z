'''''Kim Possible''''' is an [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] about a teenage crime fighter who has the task of dealing with worldwide, family, and school issues every day.  The show is action-oriented, but also has a light-hearted atmosphere and often lampoons the conventions and clichés of the secret-agent and action genres.

== Premise ==
The series revolves around the life of [[Kim Possible (character)|Kimberly Ann Possible]], a junior adventurer who deals with both super-villains trying to take over the world and her own school life without actually living a [[double life]]. Her lifetime friend [[Ron Stoppable]] and Ron's pet [[naked mole rat]], Rufus, act as [[sidekick]]s. They are backed up by [[Wade]], a ten-year-old genius who gives Kim her equipment and missions and never seems to leave his room, though he does on a few occasions in the last season.

The characters live in the average town of Middleton<!-- DO NOT ADD A STATE TO THIS, no state was ever specified, and the producers have said they did not mean it to be in any specific state -->, and while the series revolves mostly around Kim’s fight against her enemies, she usually also has to deal with problems in her own daily life as a cheerleading teenager, normally as a [[subplot]] in many episodes.<ref>[http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=14988 Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley Interview on Kim Possible Season 4]</ref>

== Production ==
Creators [[Mark McCorkle]] and [[Bob Schooley]] claim they created the show in an elevator.  As they tell it, McCorkle looked at Schooley and said, "Kim Possible: she can do anything".  Schooley at once replied, "Her partner is Ron Stoppable: he can't do anything".  The creators also maintain that it was always their intention for Kim and Ron to eventually become involved romantically, rather than just remaining best friends.  This becomes a reality in the supposed series-ending movie, ''[[So the Drama|Kim Possible: So the Drama]]''.  The romantic theme also continues in season four.<ref>[http://www.animationartconservation.com/kim_possible.html The Background Art of Kim Possible''] Art director Alan Bodner and executive producer/director Chris Bailey discuss the Background Art of Disney's Kim Possible.</ref>

The series premiered on [[Disney Channel]] in June 2002, and the first episode to air, ''[[Crush (Kim Possible)|Crush]]'', was nominated for a Primetime Emmy award the following year.  After the premiere of this episode, ''Kim Possible'' was the most watched and highest rated television show on Disney Channel at that time. The series as a whole was nominated for the Daytime Emmy  in 2004, and again in 2005 (that year it received 5 nominations and 1 win).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278866/awards Awards for "Kim Possible"] (2006), retrieved August 4, 2006</ref>.  The show has been widely praised for its smart dialogue, fluid animation, and engaging, well-written characters (both heroic and villainous).<ref>[http://savedisneyshows.org/news/index.php?article=88 Latest interview with Steve Loter]</ref>

On February 22, 2005, after 3 seasons and 65 episodes, the show ended production. Due to the popularity of the series and grassroots operations by dedicated ''KP'' fans, Disney announced on November 29, 2005, that the show would be renewed for a fourth season, which debuted on Disney Channel on February 10, 2007. The series finale aired on September 7, 2007 with the airing of the one-hour-long concluding episode, "Graduation."<ref>http://sothefinale.blogspot.com/ So The Finale], Official Season 4 finale production blog by Steve Loter (2008-01-01)</ref>

Steve Loter documented the production of the final episode of season 4, and thus the completion of the Kim Possible franchise, in a blog titled "So the Finales" hosted on [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]. It included behind the scenes and production information from the perspective of the crew as well as production sketches from one of several alternative endings that had been scripted. So the Finale maintained an open comment system allowing fans to express their views on the franchise and its closure.<ref name=loter1>Loter Steve (2007) "[http://sothefinale.blogspot.com/ So the Finale]", Blogger</ref>

The show's title music, "Call Me, Beep Me", is sung by [[Christina Milian]].  Artist [[Stephen Silver]] was the lead character designer. ''Kim Possible'' also airs on [[Toon Disney]] in the [[United States]], and [[Family (TV channel)|Family]] in Canada. Some early episodes have been aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of its [[Saturday morning]] block [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]].<ref>[http://www.bloggingbaby.com/2006/01/13/kim-possibles-creators-speak-an-interview-with-mark-mccorkle-a/ earlier Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley Interview]</ref> 

In the UK, the show can be seen often on [[Toonattik]] (GMTV's children's weekend slot on ITV1). It's currently on Saturday mornings.

In Australia, Kim Possible can be seen on Disney Channel Australia 3 times a day along with the Seven Network which are currently repeating the final season every Saturday at 7:05am. In India, Kim Possible can be seen on "Toon Disney", "Disney Channel" and "Disney CineMagic".

The show hovers around the conflict of good and bad. The good is represented by the [[protagonist]]s: vigilante and teen crime-fighter [[Kim Possible]], assisted by her faithful sidekick [[Ron Stoppable]], the main source of [[comic relief]] for the show. During the show, Kim and Ron progress through the high school, starting in the ninth grade in the pilot episode ''[[Crush (Kim Possible)|Crush]]'' and ending on the [[prom]] in the final episode ''[[Graduation (Kim Possible)|Graduation]]''.

Together the duo fights various [[antagonists]]. The most common of these is [[Doctor Drakken]] assisted by his henchwoman [[Shego]], whose unsuccessful world domination schemes appear in almost every episode of the show. The other common villains are [[Monkey Fist]], [[Duff Killigan]], [[Señor Senior, Sr.]] and [[Señor Senior, Jr.|Jr.]] and [[Professor Dementor]]. Monkey Fist starts out as an [[Indiana Jones]]-like persona, but soon turns into a [[megalomania]]cal practicer of [[monkey kung fu]], a real-world fighting discipline [[supernatural]]ized and portrayed as mystical in the series.<ref name=ep13>''Kim Possible'', episode 13, Monkey Fist Strikes (13 September 2002)</ref> Duff Killigan is an overweight [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[golf]] player who wears a [[kilt]] and attacks his opponents by exploding [[golf ball]]s.<ref name=ep14>''Kim Possible'', episode 14, October 31st (11 October 2002)</ref> The Señor Senior father and son duo are at first just extremely rich people owning a large resort island. However, they are inadvertently dragged into the evil business by Ron Stoppable. Senior, the father is more business-oriented, as his son tends to exploit the evil ways for not-so-evil deeds, such as opening a personal [[disco]].<ref name=ep3>''Kim Possible'', episode 3, The New Ron (7 June 2002)</ref><ref name=ep11>''Kim Possible'', episode 11, Coach Possible (23 August 2002)</ref> Little is revealed about Professor Dementor, an antagonist obsessed with world domination schemes like Doctor Drakken, his sworn enemy, although Dementor usually turns out to be more successful.<ref name=ep39>''Kim Possible'', episode 39, Hidden Talent (2 January 2004)</ref><ref name=ep54>''Kim Possible'', episode 54, Bonding (22 October 2004)</ref>
