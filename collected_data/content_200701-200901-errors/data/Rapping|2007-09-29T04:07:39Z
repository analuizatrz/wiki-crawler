'''Rapping''' is the [[rhythm]]ic [[toasting|spoken delivery]] of [[rhyme]]s and wordplay, one of the central elements of [[hip hop music]] and [[hip hop culture|culture]]. Although the word ''rap'' has sometimes been claimed to be a [[backronym]] of the phrase "Rhythmic American Poetry", "Rhythm and Poetry", "Rhythmically Applied Poetry", or "Rhythmically Associated Poetry", (the origins of the word may have had to do with calling criminal charges a "rap") use of the word to describe quick and slangy speech or repartee long predates the musical form.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary''</ref> 

Rapping, which is also known as Emceeing, Flowing, MCing, Rhyme spitting, Spitting, or Rhyming, can be delivered over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a grey area among speech, prose, poetry, and song.  Rap is derived from the [[griot]]s (folk poets) of [[African music|West Africa]], [[Caribbean Music|Caribbean]]-style [[toasting]], and [[American music|American]] [[Blues]] and [[Jazz]] roots. 

Rapping developed both inside and outside of hip hop since Jamaican expatriate [[Kool Herc]] first began doing his [[dancehall]] [[toasting]] in New York in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the success of groups like [[Run-DMC]] led to a huge wave of commercialized rap music. By the end of the 1990s, hip hop became widely accepted in mainstream music. Underground Hip-hop rapping from the 2000s has complex rhythms, [[cadence (music)|cadences]], an intricate [[poetic|poetic form]], and inventive [[wordplay]]. Rap lyrics convey the street life from which hip hop originally emerged with references to popular culture and hip-hop slang. Although rap has become an international phenomenon, many types of rap deal with issues such as [[race]], [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic class]], and [[gender]].

=== Roots ===
{{seealso|Roots of hip hop|Talking blues}}
Rapping in [[hip hop music]] can be traced back in many ways to its African roots. Centuries before the [[United States]] existed, the [[griot]]s (folk poets) of [[West Africa]] were rhythmically delivering stories over [[drums]] and sparse instrumentation. Because of the time that has passed since the griots of old, the connections between rap and the African griots are widely established, but not clear–cut. However, such connections have been acknowledged by rappers, modern day "griots", [[spoken-word]] artists, mainstream news sources, and academics.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3622406.stm| title = BBC NEWS: Africa| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://rap.about.com/mbiopage.htm| title = About.com: Rap| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.pbs.org/theblues/classroom/deftradition.html| title = PBS lesson plan on the blues| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/2001/3/01.03.08.x.html#b| title = Yale University Teachers Association| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref>

[[Blues music]], [[Origins of the blues|rooted]] in the [[work songs]] and [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]] of [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] and influenced greatly by West African musical traditions, was first played by blacks (and some whites) in the [[Mississippi Delta]] region of the United States around the time of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Grammy-winning blues musician/historian [[Elijah Wald]] and others have argued that the blues were being rapped as early as the 1920s.<ref name="r12">{{cite web| url = http://www.elijahwald.com/hipblues.html| title = Hip Hop and Blues| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.yazoorecords.com/2018.htm| title = The Roots of Rap| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref> Wald went so far as to call hip hop "the living blues."<ref name="r12" /> 
[[Image:Memphis jugband.jpg|frame|left|The [[Memphis Jug Band]], an early blues group, whose lyrical content and rhythmic singing predated rapping.]]
[[Jazz]], developed from the blues and other African-American musical traditions, originated around the beginning of the 20th century.  According to [[John Sobol]], the jazz musician and poet who wrote ''[[Digitopia Blues]]'', rap "bears a striking resemblance to the evolution of jazz both stylistically and formally."<ref name="digitopia">[[John Sobol]]'s ''[[Digitopia]]''</ref> 

During the mid-20th century, the musical culture of the Caribbean was constantly influenced by the concurrent changes in [[American music]]. In the 1950s through the 1970s, the descendants of Caribbean slaves in [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] were mixing their traditional folk music styles of [[mento]] and [[Calypso]] music with the [[jazz]], [[soul]], [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[blues]] of America.. In Jamaica this influenced the creation of [[Reggae]] music (and later [[Dancehall]]), while in Trinidad, this influenced the creation of [[Soca]].  As early as 1969, [[Deejay]]s were [[toasting]] (an African tradition of "rapped out" tales of heroism) over [[dub music|dubbed]] Jamaican beats.  It was called ''rap'', expanding the word's earlier meaning in the African-American community— "to discuss or debate informally."<ref name="r0">The earlier meaning being "a usage well established among African-Americans by the 1960s.", according to the ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary]]'', 4th Edition.</ref>

=== 1970s ===
The dubbed [[dancehall]] [[toasting|toasts]] of Jamaica, as well as the [[disco]]-rapping and jazz-based spoken word [[beat poetry]] of the United States set the template for the rapping in hip hop music. [[Gil Scott-Heron]], a [[Jazz Poetry|Jazz Poet]] and [[Blues]]man who wrote and released such seminal songs as ''[[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]'', ''H2OGate Blues Part 2: We Beg Your Pardon America'' and ''Johannesberg'', has been cited as an influence on many rappers.  One of the first rappers in hip hop was also hip hop's first [[DJ]]&mdash; [[Kool Herc]].  Herc, a Jamaican immigrant, started delivering simple raps at his parties in the early 1970s.  As Herc would explain in a 1989 interview, "[t]he whole chemistry came from Jamaica.  I was listening to American music in Jamaica, and my favorite artist was [[James Brown]].  When I came over here I just had to put it in the American style."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.daveyd.com/interviewkoolherc89.html| title = Davey D's Hip-Hop Corner| accessdate = December 20| accessyear = 2005}}</ref>  Although rapping in hip hop began with the DJs, most rappers today don't DJ or [[hip hop product|produce]] on a regular basis; [[Coke La Rock]] is cited by [[Kool Herc]] as the first example of such a rapper.<ref>[http://www.daveyd.com/koolherc.html Davey D's Hip-Hop Corner] - Interview with Kool DJ Herc.  Retrieved on [[January 9]], [[2007]].</ref> By the end of the 1970s, hip hop had spread throughout New York, and was getting some radio play. Rappers were increasingly writing songs that fit [[pop music]] structures and featured continuous rhymes.  [[Melle Mel]] (of [[The Furious Five]]) stands out as one of the earliest rap innovators.

=== 1980s ===
{{seealso|Old school hip hop|Golden age hip hop}}

From the 1970s to the early 1980s, Melle Mel set the way for future rappers through his sociopolitical content as well as his creative wordplay. Hip hop lyricism saw its biggest change with the popularity of [[Run-DMC]]'s ''[[Raising Hell]]'' in the mid-1980s, known especially for the [[rapcore|rap/rock]] collaboration with [[rock band]] [[Aerosmith]] in the song "[[Walk This Way]]".  This album helped set the tone of toughness and lyrical prowess in hip hop;  Run-DMC were almost yelling their aggressive lyrics. 

The 1980s saw  a huge wave of commercialized rap music, that with it brought success and international popularity. Rap music transcended its original demographic and passed in to the suburbs. The first rap hit of the 80`s was Blondies [[Rapture]] following on from [[rappers Delight]] in 1979 from [[Sugarhill Gang]].Rap music in this time kept its original fan base in the '[[ghetto]]' while attracting interest from mainstream consumers. This decade also saw the emergence of what we now know as [[old school hip hop]] talented artists such as [[Run DMC]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Public Enemy]] and the first white rap band {{Fact|date=September 2007}} the [[Beastie Boys]]. This decade is also referred to as the [[Golden age hip hop]] by modern music historians.
Rap in the early 1980s centered mostly around self promotion e.g. the amount of gold worn or one's prowess with females, however in 1987 Public Enemy introduced a more socio-political edge with their debut album ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]''. Other artists such as [[The Jungle Brothers]] looked to Africa for inspiration. In 1987 the rap group [[N.W.A.]] released their first album entitled [[N.W.A. and the Posse]], and included rap stars [[Dr. Dre]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Eazy E]], and [[MC Ren]]. This release marked the first shift from the golden age to the ensuing ages of [[Gansta rap]] and [[G-Funk]].

===1990s===
{{seealso|Golden age hip hop|Gangsta rap}}
Rap in the 1990s saw a substantial change in direction in the style of rapping. Where the 1980s were characterized by verses mostly constrained to straightforward structures and rhyme schemes, rappers in the 1990s explored deviations from those basic forms, freeing up the lyrical flow and switching up the patterns to create a much more fluid and complex style. The style on the East coast became more aggressive, a style pioneered by [[Ghostface Killah]] and [[Notorious B.I.G.]], while West coast hip-hop became more laid-back, funky, and smooth, as made popular by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[2Pac]]. {{sample box start|the roots of rapping}}

{{multi-listen end}}
{{sample box end}}

In terms of subject matter, the 1990s saw a shift from personal promotion and glorification to narratives of street experience and darker social observation, although this shift was more pronounced on the East coast than it was on the West. Rappers like the ''Guru'' of [[Gang Starr]] and ''Raekwon the Chef'' of the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] wove a new hip-hop lexicon out of ''Five Percenter'' terminology and personal experience that continues to dominate the lyrics of many MCs to this day.

The 1990s were marked by a tense rivalry between MCs of the East and West coast, including a feud between Sean "Puffy" Combs' ''Bad Boy Records'' in the East, including the Notorious B.I.G., and Dr. Dre and Suge Knight's Death Row Records (including 2pac and [[Snoop Dogg]]). [[Freestyling]] became a skill that demonstrates an MC's versatility and creativity, but also as a verbal "duel" or "spar". The mid 1990s were marked by the violent  deaths of Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G., Freaky Tah, and Big L (among others). By the end of the 1990s, hip-hop became widely accepted in mainstream music.

===2000s ===
{{main|New school hip hop}}
The genre of rap and hip-hop in its modern iteration is increasingly  influenced by other musical forms. Notably, remixes of existing hits with current notable rappers has become an increasing trend. The influence of rap has increased internationally, with independent styles, such as [[Grime]], [[Trip Hop]], and [[Hyphy]]. Southern and midwestern rap has also gained increasing popularity and penetrated the coastal markets on a large scale for the first time. Along with the increasing commercialisation of rap and hip-hop culture, this has led to many artists such as [[Nas]] to claim that "hip-hop is dead", echoing the common ironic refrain from self-identified [[Punk Rock|Punks]] that Punk is dead.

=== Rhyme styles ===
{{seealso|Rhyme scheme}}
Aside from 'flow' (the voice and tone of a particular MC), and rhythmic delivery, the only other central element of rapping is [[rhyme]]. In classical poetry, rhymes that span many syllables are often considered whimsical, but in hip hop the ability to construct raps with large sets of rhyming syllables is valued. Rap can contain any and all forms of rhyme found in classical poetry such as [[consonance]], [[assonance]], [[half rhyme]], or [[internal rhyme]]. Rappers are known for their style of rhyming. [[Juelz Santana]] often avoids full rhymes in favor of assonance, consonance, half rhymes, and internal rhymes. [[Eminem]], on the other hand, often focuses on complex and lengthy [[multisyllabic rhymes|multisyllabic rhyme]] schemes,  while "flowas" like [[Rakim]] use metaphorical, emotional, rhyming, and story telling to communicate a message.

=== Literary technique ===
{{main|Literary technique}}
Rappers use [[double entendre]]s, [[alliteration]], and all other forms of wordplay that are also found in classical poetry. [[Simile]]s and [[metaphor]]s are used extensively in rap lyrics; rappers such as [[Fabolous]] and [[Lloyd Banks]] have written entire songs wherein every line contains a simile or metaphor.

Hip hop lyrics often make passing references to popular culture and other topics. An example is the song [[Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing Ta F' Wit]] by the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], in which [[RZA]] rhymes, 

"I be tossin', enforcin', my style is awesome<br />
I'm causin more Family Feuds than [[Richard Dawson]]<br />
And the survey said - you're dead<br />
Fatal flying guillotine chops off your fuckin' head"<br />

Such [[allusion]]s serve to illustrate or exaggerate a statement, or are simply used for humour. Some of these reference are overtly political, while others simply acknowledge, credit, or show dismay about aspects of the rapper's culture and life.

===Diction & Dialect===
Many hip hop listeners believe that a rapper's lyrics are enhanced by a complex vocabulary. [[Kool Moe Dee]] claims that he appealed to older audiences by using a complex vocabulary in his raps.<ref name="r1" /> Rap is famous, however, for having its own vocabulary&mdash; from international hip hop slang to local/regional slang. Some artists, like the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], develop an entire lexicon among their clique. [[African American Vernacular English]] has always had a significant effect on hip hop slang, and vice-versa. Certain regions have introduced their unique regional slang to hip hop culture, such as the [[Oakland, California|Bay Area]] ([[Mac Dre]], [[E-40]]), [[Houston]] ([[Chamillionaire]], [[Paul Wall]]), [[Atlanta]] ([[OutKast]], [[Lil Jon]], [[T.I.]]), and [[Kentucky]] ([[Nappy Roots]]). [[The Nation of Gods and Earths]], a religious/spiritual group spun off from the [[Nation of Islam]], has influenced mainstream hip hop slang with the introduction of phrases such as "word is bond" that have since lost much of their original spiritual meaning.
[[Image:Snoop Dogg Hawaii.jpg|thumb| [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] performing for the [[US Navy]]]]
Preference toward one or the other has much to do with the individual; [[GZA]], for example, prides himself on being very visual and metaphorical but also succinct, where underground rapper [[Daniel Dumile|MF DOOM]] is known for heaping similes upon similes. In still another variation, [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]] was known for saying exactly what he meant, literally and clearly.

=== Subject matter ===
{{seealso|Concept rap}}
[[Hip hop music]] originated in [[New York City]] in the 1970s, and continues to focus largely on metropolitan centers in the [[East Coast hip hop|East]] and [[West Coast hip hop|West]] coasts of America. Many rappers use urban culture as the backdrop for their raps, focusing on the hardships of inner-city life. One element that has always existed in rapped rhymes, dating back to hip hop's inception, is "the struggle". This struggle was originally financial or personal in nature; getting a girlfriend, or paying the rent. With "[[The Message (song)|The Message]]", a [[concept rap]] written by [[Melle Mel]] and performed by [[Grandmaster Flash#Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five|Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]], the idea of "the struggle" was put in another context: the shared hardships of the ghetto.

The roots of these sociopolitical raps are in the [[beat poetry]] of [[The Last Poets]] and [[Gil Scott Heron]]. "The Message" pioneered the inclusion of political content in hip hop rhymes, expanding beyond basic personal issues and party raps. In the [[golden age of hip hop]], [[Public Enemy]] emerged, with a focus on political and social issues. Modern East Coast hip hop artists such as [[Mos Def]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Nas]], and [[dead prez]] are known for their sociopolitical subject matter.  Their [[West Coast Hip Hop|West-coast]] counterparts include [[Emcee Lynx]], [[The Coup]], [[Paris]], and [[Michael Franti]].  

Other rappers take a less critical approach to urbanity, sometimes even embracing such aspects as crime. [[Schoolly D]] was the first notable MC to rap about crime.<ref name="r10">{{cite web|last=Blow |first=Kurtis |authorlink=Kurtis Blow |coauthors=|date= |url=http://rhino.com/Features/liners/72851lin.html|title=Kurtis Blow Presents: The History of Rap, Vol. 1: The Genesis (liner notes)|work=Kurtis Blow Presents: The History Of Rap, Vol. 1: The Genesis|accessdate=May 14|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Several years later, he would go on to influence [[Ice T]], who had more overtly "gangsta" lyrics. [[Gangsta rap]], made popular largely because of [[N.W.A.]].  Early on [[KRS-One]] was accused of celebrating crime and a hedonistic lifestyle, but after the death of his DJ, [[Scott La Rock]], KRS–ONE went on to speak out against violence in hip hop and has spent the majority of his career condemning violence and writing on issues of race and class.

Various politicians, journalists, and religious leaders, have accused rappers of fostering a culture of violence and hedonism among hip hop listeners through their lyrics.<ref name="criticism1">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2088-2272091,00.html|title=The hoodie needs a daddy, not a hug|accessdate=July 22|accessyear= 2006|first=Jill|last=Kirby|date=[[2006-07-16]]|publisher=The Times}}</ref><ref name="criticism2">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,61546,00.html|title="Challenging Pepsi"|accessdate=July 22|accessyear=2006|first=Bill|Last=O'Reilly|date=[[2002-08-28]]|publisher=Fox News}}</ref><ref name="criticism3">{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1824848,00.html|title='We need heroes'|accessdate=July 22|accessyear= 2006|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|date=[[2006-07-21]]|publisher= The Guardian}}</ref> However, there are also rappers whose messages may not be in conflict with these views, for example [[Christian hip hop]].

In contrast to the hedonistic approach of the gangsta rappers, some rappers have a spiritual or religious focus. [[Christian rap]] is currently the most commercially successful form of religious rap. Aside from [[Christianity]], the [[The Nation of Gods and Earths|Five Percent Nation]], a [[gnostic]] religious/spiritual group, has been represented more than any religious group in popular hip hop. Hip-hop artists such as [[Rakim]], the members of the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Brand Nubian]], [[X Clan]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Nas]], have had success in spreading the [[theology]] of the Five Percenters.  See the article on [[Hip hop and religion]] for a more in-depth discussion.

"Party rhymes", meant to pump up the crowd at a [[party]], were nearly the exclusive focus of [[old school hip hop]] (with the exception of [[The Furious Five]]). Party raps remain a staple of hip hop music to this day. In addition to Party raps, rappers also tend to make references to love and sex. Love raps were first popularized by [[Spoonie Gee]] of the [[Treacherous Three]], and later, in the golden age of hip hop, [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Heavy D]], and [[LL Cool J]] would continue this tradition. [[2 Live Crew]], a [[Miami bass]] group, were among the first hip hop act to be temporarily banned in the United States, for the overtly sexual and profane content of their raps.

== Performance ==
=== Flow ===
Rap delivery, or ''flow'', is defined by [[Meter (poetry)|prosody]], [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and [[tempo|speed]].  Cadence deals with the dynamics and patterns of the rhythm.  In addition to ''rubato'' (changes in tempo for the purpose of expression), cadence can also serve to reinforce  song structure through ''ritardando'' (the gradual slowing down of [[tempo]]).  [[Old school hip hop|Old school]] rappers generally maintained a simple cadence, without much deviation,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=73:1|title = allmusic| accessdate = December 22| accessyear = 2005}}</ref> while [[the golden age of hip hop|golden age]] rappers such as [[Rakim]] experimented extensively with cadence.<ref name="r1" /> Present day popular rappers like [[Method Man]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[André 3000]] are considered to have a versatile cadence because of their ability to rap over disparate beats equally well. 

A common way MCs judge how to flow in a verse is by writing a rhyme so that the most stressed words coincide with the beats [[percussion]], in a way that makes the rhyming sound more musical (as opposed to spoken word) and that better combines the MC's voice with the musical backdrop.  Rakim -- whom many credit with changing the way most rappers flow on a song -- experimented not only with following the percussion, but also with complementing the song's melody with his own voice, making his flow sound like that of an instrument (a saxophone in particular.<ref>[http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2006/07/rakim-allah-interview.html Rakim Allah Interview] - YoungAmerica, from Friday, July 07, 2006</ref>

The ability to rap quickly and clearly is sometimes regarded as an important sign of skill. In certain [[list of genres of hip hop|hip hop subgenres]] such as [[chopped and screwed]], slow-paced rapping is often considered optimal. The current record for fastest rapper is held by [[MC Ricky Brown]], who rapped 723 syllables in 51.27 seconds (14.1 syllables per second) on his track "[[No Clue]]" at [[B&G Studios]] on [[January 15]] [[2005]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50916 | title = Guinness World Records | accessdate = December 17 | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref>.[http://www.myspace.com/mcdelicate MC Delicate ](Kenya) is also one of the African Rappers cashing on this speed flow rap due to his ability to roll over several syllables in a couple of seconds.

To successfully deliver a nicely ''flowing'' rap, a rapper must also develop vocal presence, [[enunciation]], and [[breath control]]. Vocal presence is the distinctiveness of a rapper's voice on record. Enunciation is essential to a flowing rap; some rappers choose also to exaggerate it for comic and artistic effect. Breath control, taking in air without interrupting one's delivery, is an important skill for a rapper to master, and a must for any MC. An MC with poor breath control can't deliver difficult verses without making unintentional pauses. 

Raps are sometimes delivered with melody. West Coast rapper [[Egyptian Lover]] was the first notable MC to deliver "sing-raps."<ref name="r10" /> Popular rappers such as [[50 Cent]] and [[Ja Rule]] add a slight melody to their otherwise purely percussive raps whereas some rappers, such as [[Cee-Lo]], are able to [[harmony|harmonize]] their raps with the beat. The Midwestern group [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]] was one of the first groups to achieve nation-wide recognition for using the fast-paced, melodic and harmonic raps that are also practiced by [[Do or Die]], another Midwestern group.

=== Freestyle rapping ===
{{seealso|Freestyle rap}}
There are two kinds of [[Freestyle rapping]]: one is scripted (recitation), but having no particular overriding subject matter, the second
typically referred to as ''freestyling'' or ''spitting'', is the improvisation of rapped lyrics.  When freestyling, some rappers inadvertently reuse old lines, or even "cheat" by preparing segments or entire verses in advance. Therefore, freestyles with proven spontaneity are valued above generic, always usable lines.<ref>Freestyle: The Art of Rhyme (2000)</ref>  Rappers will often reference places, objects in their immediate setting, or specific (usually demeaning) characteristics of opponents, to prove their authenticity and originality.

=== Battle rapping ===
{{seealso|Battle rap|Diss track}}
[[Battle rap]]ping, which can be freestyled, is the competition between two or more rappers in front of an audience.  The tradition of insulting one's friends or acquaintances in rhyme goes back to [[the dozens]], and was portrayed famously by [[Mohammed Ali]] in his boxing matches. The winner of a battle is decided by the crowd and/or preselected judges. According to [[Kool Moe Dee]], a successful battle rap focuses on an opponents weaknesses, rather than one's own strengths.<ref name="r1" /> [[Television show]]s such as [[BET]]'s ''[[106 and Park]]'' and [[MTV]]'s ''DFX'' host weekly freestyle battles live on the air. Battle rapping gained widespread public recognition outside of the African-American community with rapper [[Eminem]]'s movie, ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]].''

The strongest battle rappers will generally perform their rap fully freestyled.  This is the most effective form in a battle as the rapper can comment on the other person, whether it be what they look like, or how they talk, or what they wear.  It also allows the rapper to reverse a line used to 'diss' him/her if they are the second rapper to battle.

==Social Impact==
===Race & Class===
{{seealso|Race in hip hop}}
By the [[United States 2000 Census]], three-quarters of the United States' population is white, while one-eighth is black. However, almost all popular rappers in the United States are black.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Rap, Black Rage, and Racial Difference|last=Best|first=Steven|coauthors=Kellner, Douglas|journal=Enculturation|volume=2|issue=2|year=1999|url=http://enculturation.gmu.edu/2_2/best-kellner.html|accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> Some believe this discrepancy is a good thing; popular rapper [[Kanye West]] has said: "I hate music where white people are trying to sound black. The white music I like [sounds] white".<ref>{{cite web | date = 27 | year = 2005 | month = September | url = http://au.launch.yahoo.com/050926/10/a0h5.html | title = Kanye West: 'White People Should Make White Music' | publisher = Soundbuzz/Yahoo!

Wealth and class are significant issues in hip-hop, a culture which was developed mainly among the lower and lower-middle class blacks of inner-city New York.  Any view of money that can be seen in real life can also be seen in the lyrics of rap-- just as there are rappers who often brag about their extravagant wealth, or more specifically, their "rags to riches" stories, there are political militants who decry materialism. Although most of hip hop's famous and influential rappers have come from inner-city ghettos<ref>[http://www.youthspecialties.com/articles/topics/urban/hip-hop.php Hip-Hop as Culture] - by Efrem Smith (2007)</ref> , hip-hop has always represented a variety of economic backgrounds.  For example, [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[The Beastie Boys]], [[Rakim]], [[Black Sheep (hip hop group)|Black Sheep]], and [[Kanye West]]<ref name=Kanye">{{cite web| last = Tyrangiel | first = Josh | url = http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1096499,00.html | title = Why You Can't Ignore Kanye | format = | work = [[Time Magazine]] | publisher = | accessdate = May 21|accessyear = 2006}}</ref> were middle-class when they began rapping.

Race issues often intersect with class issues.  [[Vanilla Ice]], a white [[pop rap]]per, went so far as to lie about his place of origin, claiming that he came from the inner-city of [[Miami, Florida]], when he was actually from [[suburb]]an [[Texas]]. According to Vanilla Ice, he was encouraged to lie by his record company, to increase their profits.<ref name="Vanilla Ice">{{cite web| last = Austen | first = Jake | url = http://www.roctober.com/roctober/greatness/vanilla.html | title = Vanilla Ice: The Ice Is Right | format = | work = Rocktober Roctober #24, 1999| publisher = | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> In juxtaposition to Vanilla Ice stand the [[Beastie Boys]], a rap group composed of white [[Judaism|Jewish]] teenagers. The Beastie Boys didn't lie about their middle-class and suburban upbringing, and managed to sell millions of records while maintaining the respect of the hip hop community.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/beastie_boys/bio.jhtml Beastie Boys: Biography] - VH1.com</ref>  

[[House of Pain]],  an [[Irish-American]] crew with members from [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York]], were downright assertive about their ethnicity, including footage of St. Patricks Day parades in the music video for their first hit single [[Jump Around]] and name-checking prominent Irish Americans in their lyrics.  They also incorporated time signatures associated with traditional [[Irish Folk Music]] such as [[Jigs]] and [[Reels]] into their songs - a major deviation from mainstream hip hop where virtually every song is done in 4/4 time.  Their first self-titled album went multi-platinum.  The group split up after their third album and lead-rapper [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] went on to pursue a solo career, releasing the multi-platinum [[Whitey Ford Sings the Blues]] in [[1998]] and the platinum [[Eat at Whiteys]] in 2000.  He is currently a member of [[La Coka Nostra]], along with [[Danny Boy]], another original House of Pain member.  [[DJ Lethal]] went on to be the DJ for [[Limp Bizkit]], a rap-rock group that has repeatedly gone multi-platinum.

The most recent mainstream exception to the skin color trend in mainstream rappers is [[Eminem]], who is of mainly [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, who grew up in the primarily black city of [[Detroit]].<ref>http://music.yahoo.com/ar-289114-bio--Eminem</ref> In his song "[[White America]]", Eminem attributes his selling success to his being more easily digestible by a white audience, because he "looks like them."

Other prominent American rappers of primarily [[European ethnic groups|European]] decent include [[Sage Francis]], [[Emcee Lynx]], [[El-Producto]], [[Aesop Rock]], and many others.  Race, class, and ethnicity  remain prominent themes in hip hop music in general, regardless of race.  [[Emcee Lynx]] in particular is notable for addressing these issues in his music and referencing his [[Ulster Scots|Scots Irish]] heritage in his music as a point of pride.

Despite the fact that the majority of American artists in the mainstream are Black, some statistics indicate that most hip hop record purchasers are white, reflecting demographics and economics. According to [[musicology|musicologist]] [[Arthur Kempton]], "Today 70 percent of hip-hop is bought by white kids".<ref>{{cite news|title=HIP-HOP SETTING THE BEAT IN FIRST, BLACK ARTISTS HOLD BILLBOARD'S TOP 10|first=Joan|last=Anderman|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=[[2003-10-04]]|url=http://hsan.org/content/main.aspx?pageid=21|accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref>  [[Boots Riley]] has criticized these figures, pointing out that they only count sound-scan sales, which automatically excludes the mom-and-pop record stores located in majority Black and Latino neighborhoods that the major music chains tend to avoid, and thus dramatically under-represents the number of sales made in such communities.   

According to political rapper Zion of [[Zion I]], socially conscious hip hop has a mainly white audience: "...so many Black people don't want to hear it. They want that thug shit." In addition to Zion, several other underground rappers, such as Boots Riley of [[The Coup]], report nearly all-white audiences.<ref name="Village">{{cite web|last= Kitwana |first= Bakari|date= [[June 24]], [[2005]] |url= http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0526,kitwana,65332,22.html |title= The Cotton Club |publisher= The Village Voice  |accessdate= February 2 |accessyear= 2006 }}</ref>

=== Gender and sexuality ===
{{seealso|List of female rappers}}
Almost all popular rappers identify themselves as [[heterosexual]]. [[Homophobia]] is both prevalent and blatant throughout hip hop culture; however, some heterosexual rappers like [[Kanye West]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4165706.stm Star says rap is 'too homophobic'] - BBC News (2005)</ref> are continuing to fight against homophobia in hip hop. 

Though the majority of rappers are male, there have been a number of female rap stars, including [[Lauryn Hill]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Da Brat]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] and [[Foxy Brown]].

=== Derivatives and influence ===
Throughout hip hop's history, new musical styles and genres have developed that contain rapping. Entire genres, such as [[rapcore]] ([[rock music|rock]]/[[metal music|metal]]/[[punk music|punk]] with rapped vocals) and [[hip house]] have resulted from the fusion of rap and other styles. All popular music genres with a focus on percussion have contained rapping at some point&mdash; be it [[disco]] ([[DJ Hollywood]]), [[jazz]] ([[Gangstarr]]), [[New Wave (music)|new wave]] ([[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]), [[funk]] ([[Fatback Band]]), [[contemporary R&B]] ([[Mary J. Blige]]), [[Reggaeton]] ([[Daddy Yankee]]), or even Japanese dance music, such as ([[Soul'd Out]]). [[UK garage]] music has begun to focus increasingly on rappers in a new subgenre called [[Grime]], pioneered and popularized by the MC, [[Dizzee Rascal]]. Increased popularity with the music has shown more UK rappers going to America as well as to tour there, such as [[Sway DaSafo]] possibly signing with [[Akon]]'s label [[Konvict]].  [[Hyphy]] is the latest of these spin-offs.  The style originated in [[Oakland]] [[California]] and gained national attention in 2006 starting with [[E-40]]'s album [[My Ghetto Report Card]]. It is typified by slowed-down atonal vocals with instrumentals that borrow heavily from the [[Rave]] scene and lyrics centered on illegal street racing and car culture.  Another Oakland California group, [[Beltaine's Fire]], has recently gained attention for their [[Celtic Fusion]] sound which blends hip hop beats with celtic melodies.  Unlike the majority of hip hop artists, all their music is performed live without samples, synths, or drum machines, drawing comparisons to [[The Roots]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]]. 

[[Bhangra]], a widely popular style of music from [[Punjab (India)]] has been mixed numerous times with [[reggae]] and hip-hop music. The most popular song in this genre in the United States was "mundian to bach ke" or "Beware the boys" by [[panjabi mc]] and [[Jay-Z]]. Although mundian to bach ke was already a song inspired by [[knight rider]],the mixing with Jay-Z popularized the genre further.

===Regional variations===
====France====
{{Main|French hip hop}}
Outside of the United States the largest hip hop scene is in [[France]] and artists such as [[MC Solar]] and [[Les Nubians]] have even crossed over into the American market.  As with early American hip hop social and political issues figure strongly in much of french hip hop and the majority of performers come from the country's ethnic minorities, notably the Arab population.  The [[Breton language|French language Breton]] group [[Manau]] was the first [[Celtic Fusion|Celtic Hip Hop]] band to achieve mainstream success.  See the article on [[French hip hop]] for a more in depth discussion.

====Portugal====
{{Main|Hip hop Tuga}}
Portuguese hip hop (Hip hop português) mostly known as [[Hip Hop Tuga]] is the Portuguese variety of hip hop music, although different because it is mixed with African music from Lusophone Africa and reggae. Popular Portuguese rappers include [[Clã da Matarroa]], [[Valete]], [[Da Weasel]], [[Boss AC]], [[Sam the Kid]] (rapper & producer), [[Dealema]], [[Mind Da Gap]], [[Bonus]], [[Adamastor]] and [[DJ Bomberjack]].

====UK====
{{Main|British hip hop}}
The UK scene has also gained international prominence, especially since the fact that the performers rap in English makes them more marketable to American audiences then their French counterparts.  The UK sound incorporates extremely fast flows and strong electronica and [[drum n bass]] influences.  The [[Bristol Sound]] in particular was influential in the creation of [[Trip Hop]], which combines slowed-down hip hop beats with sung vocals. UK artists are beginning to achieve crossover into the American market, notable Mcee [[Kano]] was featured on the [[Def Jam Icon]] [[Xbox 360]] and [[Playstation 3]] game, the only UK rapper featured there, with a wide selection of popular American rappers. [[Lady Sovereign]] has signed with the American [[Def Jam]] label. Popular UK rappers include [[Ty]], [[Klashnekoff]], [[Skinnyman]], Blak Twang, Stig Of The Dump and also young rising talents from Northwest London Krypla and Phobia. [[JME]] and [[Skepta]] of [[Boy Better Know]] are grime Mcee's but have been called rappers many times and have worked with top American producer [[Just Blaze]].

====Greece====
{{Main|Greek hip hop}}
Greek hip hop refers to hip hop music originating in Greece, either in Greek or English. The earliest Greek hip hop groups date back to 1987, though native language albums did not appear until the mid-1990s.Some of the most important early hip-hop groups in Greece were [[Imiskoumbria]], Terror X Crew (members: Artemis, Efthimis, [[DJ ALX]]), FF.C (members: Ruthmodamastis, DJ Everlast, Skinothetis, plus many guests) and [[Active Member]].This differentiation caused a lot of tension among the Greek hip-hop fans. Between 1995 and 2000, there was a lot of conflict, relatively speaking. Things escalated from there when the Battle rap era in Greece begun with the group ZN (Living Dead) that started dissing [[Active Member]] and other hip hop groups. ZN was composed of 5 members. They followed the Wu-Tang style and have been influenced from the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. They first released an EP and then a group album, followed by releasing solo albums. Their one and only album (due to feuding) as a group was "O Protos Tomos" (The First Volume) in 1997.As American hip hop lyrics became more widely violent, so did international hip hop lyrics, and Greece was no exception. Rapping about guns, drugs, violence and sex became the norm. Hardcore Greek rap had swept the genre, and commercial hip hop followed suit.Commercial hip-hop in Greece has become hugely successful, with acts like [[Imiskoumbria]], Terror X Crew and Goin' Through blazing the trails.[[Imiskoumbria]] and Terror X Crew both were the first to have their records going gold. Goin' Through became a massive success after their last album, La Sagrada Familia, was granted gold status as of 2006. Their follow-up, Vendetta, achieved gold sales within three months of its release.Goin' Through has also established Greece's big name hip-hop label, Family, where some other acts are signed. Some of the more noted acts of Family are Taraxias, Thirio, NEVMA, Ominus & DJ "S", TNS. It should be noted that the group Imiskoumbria, is widely credited as one of the Greek rap acts that made Greek hip hop a household thing. Before this, Greek hip hop was considered to be a fad or a novelty of sorts.
