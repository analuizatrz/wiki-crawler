'''Malta''', officially the '''Republic of Malta''', is a small and densely populated [[island nation]] comprising an [[archipelago]] of [[Maltese islands|seven islands]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  A country of [[Southern Europe]], Malta lies south of [[Sicily]], east of [[Tunisia]], and north of [[Libya]]. The country's official languages are [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[English language|English]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] is the most practised religion. The islands constituting the Maltese nation have been ruled by various powers and fought over for centuries. Malta has been a member state of the [[European Union]] (EU) since [[2004]] and it is currently the smallest EU country both in population and in area.

== History ==
{{main|History of Malta}}

===Early settlements===

[[Image:Malta 16 Mnajdra.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Mnajdra]] temples.]]

Malta is home to what may be the oldest freestanding structure in the world: the oldest of all the megalithic temples on the islands is il-[[Ġgantija]], in [[Għawdex]] dating back to before 3500 BC. One of the very earliest marks of civilization on the islands is the temple of [[Ħaġar Qim]], which dates from between 3200 and 2500 BC, stands on a hilltop on the southern edge of the island of Malta. Adjacent to Ħaġar Qim, lies another remarkable temple site, [[l-Imnajdra]]. The society that built these structures eventually died out or at any rate disappeared. [[Phoenicians]] colonized the islands around [[700 BC]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Sagona|first=Claudia|title=Punic Antiquities of Malta and Other Ancient Artefacts Held in Ecclesiastic and Private Collections|series=  Ancient Near Eastern Studies Supplement Series, 10|year=2003|publisher=Peeters Publishers|pages=374|isbn=978-90-429-1353-0}}</ref> using them as an outpost from which they expanded sea explorations and trade in the Mediterranean.

The islands later came under the control of [[Carthage]] ([[400 BC]]) and then of [[Roman Republic|Rome]] ([[218 BC]]). The islands prospered under Roman rule, during which time they were considered a [[Municipium]] and a Foederata [[Civitas]]. Many Roman antiquities still exist, testifying to the close link between the Maltese inhabitants and the people of Rome. In [[Anno Domini|AD]] 60, the islands were visited by [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], who is said to have been shipwrecked on the shores of the aptly-named "[[San Pawl il-Baħar|San Pawl il-Baħar]]". Studies of the currents and prevalent winds at the time however, render it more likely that the shipwreck occurred in or around Daħlet San Tumas in [[Wied il-Għajn]].

After a period of [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] rule ([[4th century|fourth]] to [[9th century|ninth century]]) and a probable sack by the [[Vandals]], the islands were conquered by the [[Arab]]s in AD 870. The Arabs, who generally tolerated the population's Christianity, introduced the cultivation of  citrus fruits and cotton, and irrigation systems.  Arab influence can be seen most prominently in the modern [[Maltese language]], which also contains significant Romance influences, and is written in a variation of the [[Latin alphabet]].

The period of Arab rule lasted until 1091, when the islands were taken by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Normans]]. A century later the last Norman king, [[Tancredo di Lecce]], appointed [[Margarito di Brindisi]] the first [[Count of Malta]]. Subsequent rulers included the [[Angevin]], [[Hohenstaufen]], and [[House of Barcelona|Aragonese]], who reconstituted a [[County of Malta]] in 1283. The [[Maltese nobility]] was established during this period; some of it dating back to 1400. Around thirty-two noble titles remain in use today, of which the oldest is the [[Barony of Djar il-Bniet e Buqana]]. 

[[Image:Siege of malta 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Great Siege of Malta]].]]

===Knights of Malta and Napoleon===

In [[1530]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of [[Spain]] gave the islands to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem]] in perpetual lease.  (The [[Kingdom of Aragon]] had owned the islands as part of its Mediterranean empire for some time).  These knights, a military religious order now known as the "[[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]", had been driven out of [[Rhodes]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1522. They withstood a full-blown [[Siege of Malta (1565)|siege by the Ottoman Turks]] in [[1565]], at the time the greatest sea power in the Mediterranean sea. After this they decided to increase the [[fortification]]s, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of [[Valletta]], named after [[Grand Master Jean de la Valette]], was built.  

[[Image:Aerialviewvalletta.jpg|thumb|180px|Aerial view of [[Valletta]].]]

Their reign ended when Malta was captured by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] en route to his expedition of [[Egypt]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1798. As a ruse, Napoleon asked for safe harbour to resupply his ships, and then turned his guns against his hosts once safely inside Valletta. The Grandmaster, knew that he could only allow a few ships at a time to enter the harbour, due to the Treaty of Trent.  [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]] capitulated, and Napoleon stayed in Malta for a few days, during which he systematically looted the movable assets of the Order, and established an administration controlled by his nominees.  He then sailed for Egypt, leaving a substantial garrison in Malta.  
 
The occupying French forces were unpopular, however, due particularly to their negative attitude towards religion. The financial reforms and the religious reforms did not go down well with the citizens. The Maltese rebelled against them, and the French were forced behind the fortifications.
Great Britain, along with the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], sent munitions and aid to the rebels. Britain also sent [[Royal Navy|her navy]], which instigated a blockade of the islands. The isolated French forces, under General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]], surrendered in 1800, and the island became a British [[protectorate]], being presented by several Maltese leaders to Sir [[Alexander Ball]].

===British rule and World War II===

In 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], Malta officially became a part of the [[British Empire]], and was used as a shipping way-station and fleet headquarters. Malta's position half-way between [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Suez Canal]] proved to be its main asset during these years, and it was considered to be a most important stop on the way to [[India]]. 

[[Image:Royal_Opera_House.jpg|thumbnail|250px|The [[Royal Opera House, Valletta]], bombed to the ground during [[World War II]].]]

In the early 1930s, the British Mediterranean Fleet, which was at the time the main contributor for the commerce on the island, was moved to [[Alexandria]] as an economy measure. Malta played an important role during [[World War II]], owing to its vicinity to [[Axis Powers|Axis]] shipping lanes. The bravery of the Maltese people in their long struggle against enemy attack moved H.M. [[King George VI]] to award the [[George Cross (Malta)|George Cross]] to Malta on a collective basis, unique in the history of the award, on 15 April 1942, "to bear witness to a heroism and devotion that will long be famous in history". Some historians argue that the award caused Britain to incur disproportionate losses in defending Malta, as British credibility would suffer if Malta was subsequently surrendered to the Axis, as [[Singapore]] had been. <ref> {{cite web | title=The Siege of Malta in World War Two | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/siege_malta_06.shtml | accessdate=April 15 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> A replica of the George Cross now appears in the upper hoist corner of the [[Flag of Malta]]. The [[Maltese euro coins]], however, feature the [[Maltese cross]].

===Independence===

After the war, and after a short period of political instability due to the [[Malta Labour Party]]'s unsuccessful attempt at [[History of Malta#Attempted integration with the United Kingdom|"Integration with Britain"]], Malta was granted independence on September 21, 1964 ([[Independence Day (Malta)|Independence Day]]). Under its 1964 [[constitution]], Malta initially retained Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Malta]], with a [[Governor-General]] exercising [[executive (government)|executive]] authority on her behalf. On December 13, 1974 ([[Republic Day (Malta)|Republic Day]]), however, it became a [[republic]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with the [[President of Malta|President]] as [[head of state]]. A defence agreement signed soon after independence (and re-negotiated in 1972) expired on March 31, 1979 ([[Freedom Day (Malta)|Freedom Day]]) when the British military forces were withdrawn.  Malta adopted an official policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in 1980 and, for a brief period was a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Movement of Non-Aligned Countries]].  In 1989, Malta was the venue of an important [[Malta Summit|summit]] between US President [[George H.W. Bush|Bush]] and Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], their first face-to-face encounter, which signalled the end of the [[Cold War]].

Malta joined the [[European Union]] on May 1, 2004. It intends to join the [[Eurozone]] in 2008.

== Politics ==
[[Image:Edward_Fenech_Adami.jpg|thumb|220px|Dr. [[Edward Fenech Adami]] has been the President of Malta since 2004.]]
{{main|Politics of Malta}}
Malta is a [[republic]], whose [[parliamentary system]] and [[public administration]] is closely modelled on the [[Westminster system]]. The [[unicameral]] [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]], (Maltese: ''Il-Kamra tar-Rappreżentanti''), is elected by direct universal suffrage through [[single transferable vote]] every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the [[President]] on advice of the [[Prime Minister]]. The House of Representatives is made up of sixty-five [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]]. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The [[Constitution of Malta]] provides that the President appoint as Prime Minister the member of the House who is best able to command a (governing) majority in the House.

The [[President of Malta|President of the Republic]] is elected every five years by the House of Representatives.  The role of the president as head of state is largely ceremonial.

The main political parties are the [[Partit Nazzjonalista|Nationalist Party]], which is a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] party, and the [[Malta Labour Party]], which is a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party. 

The Nationalist Party is currently at the helm of the government, the Prime Minister being [[Lawrence Gonzi|Dr. Lawrence Gonzi]]. The Malta Labour Party, led by [[Alfred Sant|Dr. Alfred Sant]], is in the opposition.

There are three other parties that presently have no parliamentary representation:
* [[Democratic Alternative (Malta)|Alternattiva Demokratika]], a [[Green Party]].
* [[Imperium Europa]], promoting [[White Nationalism]] and [[Libertarianism]].
* [[Alpha Liberal Democratic Party]], a [[liberal]] [[reformist]] party.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Mt-map.png|thumb|200px|left|Map of Malta]]
{{main|Geography of Malta}}
Malta is an [[archipelago]] in the central [[Mediterranean Sea]] (in its eastern basin), some 93 km south of the [[Italy|Italian]] island of [[Sicily]] across the Malta Channel; east of [[Tunisia]] and north of [[Libya]] in [[Africa]].  Only the three largest islands [[Malta Island]] (Malta), [[Gozo]] (Għawdex), and [[Comino]] (Kemmuna) are inhabited. The smaller islands, such as [[Filfla]], [[Cominotto]] and the [[Islands of St. Paul]] are uninhabited. Numerous bays along the indented coastline of the islands provide good harbours. The landscape is characterised by low hills with terraced fields. The highest point is at [[Ta' Dmejrek]] on Malta Island at 253 metres (830&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) near [[Dingli]]. Although there are some small rivers at times of high rainfall, there are no permanent rivers or lakes on Malta.  However some watercourses are found randomly around the island that have fresh water running all year round.  Such places are Baħrija, Imtaħleb and San Martin.  Running water in Gozo is found at Lunzjata Valley.  

[[Image:Malta_satellite_NASA.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Satellite image of Malta.]]
Contrary to popular belief, the south of Malta is not [[Extreme points of Europe|Europe's most southern point]]; that distinction belongs to the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Gavdos]]. It is even clear that the whole famous [[Greece|Greek]] [[island]] of [[Crete]] is more southern than any point of Malta.

===Climate===
The climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] Csa), with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. There is no real thermal dormant season for plants, although plant growth can be checked briefly by abnormal cold in winter (patches of ground frost may occur in inland locales), and summer heat and aridity may cause vegetation to wilt. Effectively there are only two seasons, which makes the islands attractive for tourists especially during the drier months. However, strong winds can make Malta feel cold during the spring months.

Water supply poses a problem on Malta, as the summer is both rainless and also the time of greatest water use, and the winter rainfall often falls as heavy showers and runs off to the sea rather than soaking into the ground. Malta depends on underground reserves of fresh water, drawn through a system of water tunnels called the Ta' Kandja galleries, which average about 97 m. below surface and extend like the spokes of a wheel. In the galleries in Malta's porous limestone, fresh water lies in a lens upon brine. More than half the potable water of Malta is produced by [[desalination]], which creates further issues of fossil fuel use and pollution.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6525069.stm BBC News "Briny future for vulnerable Malta" 4 April 2007]</ref>

In January 2007, [[International Living]] chose Malta as the country with the best climate in the world.<ref> [http://www.internationalliving.com/malta/free/01-25-07_worlds_best_climate.html World's Best Climate] </ref>

==Local councils==
{{main|Local councils of Malta}}
Since [[1994]], Malta has been subdivided into sixty-eight local councils or [[district]]s. These form the most basic form of local government. There are no intermediate levels between local government and national government. A list of them is below:

{{Malta-LocalCouncils}}

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Malta}}
[[Image:Valletta-Harbour.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Valletta]] Harbour]]

[[Image:Portomaso.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Portomaso]], a popular tourist destination]]
Until 1800, Malta had very few industries except the [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], and shipyards industry. The [[dockyard]] was later used by the British for military purposes. At times of war, Malta's economy prospered due to its strategic location. This could be seen during the Crimean War of 1854. This did not only benefit those who had a military role, but also the craftsmen.

In 1869, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] benefited Malta's economy greatly as there was a massive increase in the shipping which entered in the port. Entrepot trade saw many ships stopping at Malta's docks for refuelling, this brought great benefits to the population.

By the end of the 19th century, the economy began declining and by the 1940s, Malta's economy was in serious crisis. This was partially due to the longer range of newer merchant ships which required less frequent refuelling stops.

Nowadays, Malta’s major resources are [[limestone]], a favourable geographic location, and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism. Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of good-quality hotels are present on the island. An increasing number of Maltese now travel abroad on holiday.  Although they are still a net importer of tourism, the ratio of inbound tourists to outbound tourists is decreasing.  [[Films shot in Malta|Film production]] is a growing contributor to the Maltese economy, with several big-budget foreign films shooting in Malta each year.  The country has increased the exports of many other types of services such as Banking and Finance.

Another important resource for the Republic is Human Resources.  The government is investing heavily in the country's provision of education.  As all education is free, Malta is currently producing a pool of qualified persons which heavily contribute to the country's growing economy.

Malta has recently [[privatization|privatised]] some state-controlled firms and liberalised markets in order to prepare for membership in the [[European Union]], which it joined on [[May 1]] [[2004]]. Malta and [[Tunisia]] are currently discussing the commercial exploitation of the continental shelf between their countries, particularly for petroleum exploration.

The Maltese government entered [[ERM II]] on 4th May 2005, and is intending to adopt the [[euro]] as the country's currency on [[1 January]] [[2008]].

Recently in Malta, investments have been increasing and the strengh of the Maltese Economy is increasing.  A fine example is Smart City which is estimated to employ well over 5000 new jobs.

Although Malta is now a member of the European Union, it is not a member of the [[Schengen Treaty]] yet. It is currently adopting Schengen regulations with the goal to be finished by 2007.

== Demographics ==

{{main|Demographics of Malta}}

===Population===
A census of population and housing is held every ten years. The last census was held over three weeks in November 2005 and managed to enumerate an estimated 95% of the population. A preliminary report was issued in April 2006, and results were weighted to an estimate for 100% of the population.

Location for verification and for updating on next year's demographic review are commented.-->The resident population of Malta, which includes foreigners residing in Malta for at least a year, as at 27 November 2005 was estimated at 404,039 of whom 200,715 (49.7%) were males and 203,324 (50.3%) were females<!--Table 2: Population and sex ratio: 1842-2005-->. Of these, 17.1 per cent were aged 14 and under, 68.2 per cent were within the 15–64 age bracket whilst the remaining 13.7 per cent were 65 years and over<!--Table 8: Total population by broad age group and locality as at 27 November 2005-->. Malta's [[population density]] of 1,282 per [[square kilometre]] (3,322/[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) <!--Table 6: Population density: 1995-2005-->is by far the highest in the EU<!--Table 15: Population density in Europe-->, and one of the [[List of countries by population density|highest]] in the world. The only census year showing a fall in population was that of 1967, with a 1.7% total decrease, attributable to a substantial number of Maltese residents who emigrated.<ref name="Census2005">{{cite book |last=National Statistics Office |authorlink=http://www.nso.gov.mt |title=Census of Population and Housing 2005: Preliminary Report |publisher=National Statistics Office |date=2005 |location=Valletta |url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=1653 |id=ISBN-13 978-99909-73-38-9}}</ref> The Maltese-resident population for 2004 was estimated to make up 97.0% of the total resident population.<ref name="Demo2004"/>

Through all the censuses since 1842 there was always a slightly higher female-to-male ratio. Closest to reaching equality were 1901 and 1911 censuses<!-- (5000:1000 and 5003:1000 respectively)-->. The highest female-to-male ratio was reached in 1957 (5088:1000), and since the ratio has been constantly dropping. The 2005 census showed a 5013:1000 female-to-male ratio<!--Table 2: Population and sex ratio: 1842-2005-->.

Population growth has slowed down, from +9.5% between the 1985 and 1995 censuses, to +6.9% between the 1995 and 2005 censuses (a yearly average of +0.7%)<!--Commentary p.xvii & Chart 3: Percentage population change between censuses-->. The birth rate stood at 3860 (a decrease of 21.8% from the 1995 census) and the death rate stood at 3025. Thus, there was a natural population increase of 835 (compared to +888 for 2004, of which over a hundred were foreign residents).<ref name="NSO 20060711">{{cite press release |title=World Population Day - 2006: Special Observances |publisher=National Statistics Office |location=Valletta |date=[[10 July]] [[2006]] |url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=1719 |accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref>

<!--May be used in any future section on the pension problem-->The population's age composition is similar to the age structure prevalent in the EU<!--Chart 11. Comparative distribution bet Malta and EU25-->. Since 1967 there was observed a trend indicating an aging population, and is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Malta's old-age-dependency-ratio rose from 17.2% in 1995 to 19.8% in 2005, reasonably lower than the EU's 24.9% average. In fact, 31.5% of the Maltese population is aged under 25 (compared to the EU's 29.1%); but the 50-64 age group constitutes 20.3% of the population, significantly higher than the EU's 17.9%. In conclusion, Malta's old-age-dependency-ratio is expected to continue rising steadily in the coming years<!--Commentary p.xxvii-->.

Maltese legislation recognizes both civil and Canonic [[marriage]]s. Annulments by the ecclesiastic and civil courts are unrelated and are not necessarily both granted. There is no [[divorce]] legislation and [[abortion]] within Maltese territory is illegal. A person has to be 16 to marry.<!--may need citations from the Family Law--> The number of brides aged under 25 decreased from 1471 in 1997 to 766 in 2005; while the number of grooms under 25 decreased from 823 to 311. There is a constant trend that females are more likely than males to marry very young. In 2005, brides aged 16 to 19 were 51 while grooms were 8.<ref name="NSO 20060711"/>

=== Languages ===
{{main|Maltese language}}
The national language of Malta is [[Maltese language|Maltese]], a [[Semitic language]] which descended from Arabic, with many borrowings from Italian and, in particular, [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/grazio/study2.html|title=Evolution of the Maltese Language}}</ref> 

The [[Maltese alphabet]] is based on the [[Latin alphabet]], but uses the [[diacritic]]ally altered letters ''[[ż]]'', also found in [[Polish language|Polish]], as well as the letters ''[[ċ]]'', ''[[ġ]]'', ''[[għ]]'', ''[[ħ]]'' and ''[[Ie (digraph)|ie]]'', which are unique to Maltese. The official languages are Maltese and [[English language|English]]. [[Italian language|Italian]] was an official language of Malta until the 1930s, and is widely spoken as a first, second or third language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_237.en.pdf |title=Europeans and languages |accessdate=2007-01-29 |year=2005 |month=September |format=PDF |publisher=European Commission |pages=p.4}}</ref> [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], amongst other languages, are taught as foreign languages in secondary schools.

===Religion===
[[Image:Domen i Mosta.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Mosta Dome]]]]
{{main|Roman Catholicism in Malta}}
The Constitution of Malta provides for [[freedom of religion]] but establishes Roman Catholicism as the [[state religion]]. [[Freedom House]] and the ''[[World Factbook]]'' report that 98 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, making the nation one of the most Catholic countries in the world. However, the {{PDFlink|[http://www.maltachurch.org.mt/Press/02006/SUNDAY_MASS_CENSUS_-_%20FINDINGS.pdf Sunday Mass Attendance Census 2005]}} commissioned by the [http://www.maltachurch.org.mt Church of Malta] reports that only 52.6% of the population attends regular religious services. This is still the highest rate of attendance in Europe.

Around 22% of the population is reported to be active in a Church Group, Movement or Community.  Malta has the highest concentration of members per capita of the [[Neocatechumenal Way]] in the World, since it was introduced in the Islands in 1973 by three Italian cathecists, who started the first community in the Parish Church of Kuncizzjoni in Hamrun.

===Migration===
Maltese laws for immigration generally follow EU legislation. Therefore EU nationals require neither a [[visa (document)|visa]] nor a passport (an ID card or an expired passport are enough) to enter the country. Citizens of a number of other countries are also not required to apply for a visa and require only a valid passport when residing in Malta for up to three months. Visas for other nationalities are valid for one month. Immigrants are required to apply for a work permit. This exception to EU law was agreed upon before accession to safeguard the Maltese [[labour economics|labour market]], the growth of which <!--is there a source for this statement about the growth of the labour market reaching saturation?-->is reaching saturation{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. In practice though, all work permits to EU nationals are granted, and currently this exercise is only used to monitor the labour market for any needed intervention.

<!--Add statistics on legal immigration and emigration-->The estimated net inflow (using data for 2002 to 2004) was of 1,913 persons yearly. Over the last 10 years, Malta accepted back a yearly average of 425 returning emigrants.<ref name="Demo2004">{{cite book |last=National Statistics Office |authorlink=http://www.nso.gov.mt |title=Demographic Review 2004 |publisher=National Statistics Office |date=2005 |location=Valletta |url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=1542 |id=ISBN 99909-73-32-6 |page=59}}</ref>

During 2005, a total of 1,800 immigrants reached Malta illegally.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Frendo holds talks with three European Union Commission Members |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |location=Valletta |date=[[30 January]] [[2006]] |url=http://www.foreign.gov.mt/showdoc.aspx?id=210&filesource=4&file=Press%20release%20EU%20Commissioners%20300106.pdf | accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> Given Malta's high population density, the impact of this figure on Malta is equivalent to that of an arrival of 369,000 illegal immigrants in Germany and other large EU member states. In the first half of 2006, 967 illegal immigrants arrived in Malta &ndash; almost double the 473 who arrived in the same period in 2005.<ref name="Frendo03072006">{{cite press release |title=Statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Michael Frendo to resident EU Ambassadors on illegal immigration in Malta |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |location=Valletta |date=[[3 July]] [[2006]] |url=http://www.foreign.gov.mt/showdoc.aspx?id=210&filesource=4&file=Illegal%20Immigration%20-%20Statement%20for%20EU%20Ambassadors%20030706.pdf |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> The main factor contributing to the problem is Malta's approximately 250,000 square kilometres of open sea search and rescue region.

Around 45% of illegal immigrants landed in Malta have been granted [[refugee]] (5%) or protected humanitarian status (40%), which is the highest rate of acceptance in the EU. A [[White Paper]] suggesting the grant of Maltese citizenship to refugees resident in Malta for over ten years was issued in 2005. Historically Malta gave refuge (and assisted in their resettlement) to eight hundred or so East African Asians who had been expelled from [[Uganda]] by [[Idi Amin]] and to just under a thousand [[Iraq]]is fleeing [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime.

Presently the problem of illegal immigration has increased, causing real or perceived strains on Malta's health, employment and social services, its internal security and public order, its social fabric and labour market. Detention costs for the first half of 2006 alone cost Lm320,423 (€746,385).<ref>{{cite news |publisher=The Sunday Times |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/core/article.php?id=230879 |title=Immigrants refused entry into Malta |date=[[16 July]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref> 

In 2005, Malta sought EU aid in relation to reception of illegal immigrants, repatriation of those denied refugee status, resettlement of refugees into EU countries, and maritime security.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Michael |last=Frendo |title=Illegal Immigration in Malta |booktitle=EU Foreign Ministers Council |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=[[5 July]] [[2005]] |url=http://www.foreign.gov.mt/showdoc.aspx?id=96&filesource=4&file=ILLEGal%20Immigrants.pdf |accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> In December 2005, the European Council adopted ''The Global Approach to Migration: Priority Actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean''; but the deployment of said actions has been limited to the western Mediterranean, thus putting further pressure on the central Mediterranean route for illegal immigration of which Malta forms a part. Political tension started developing as the EU persistently ignored Malta's precarious situation: member states party to the legally-binding [[Cotonou Agreement]] continued not to fulfill their obligations and East African countries, from which most central Mediterranean illegal immigration originates, were excluded from the Euro-African Conference on Migration and Development held 10-11 July 2006 in Tripoli).<ref name="Frendo03072006"/>

== Education ==
Education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16 years. While the state provides education free of charge, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and the private sector run a number of schools in Malta and [[Gozo]]. Most of the teachers' salary in Church schools is paid by the state.
Education in Malta is based on the [[Education in the United Kingdom|British Model]]. 
<p>
[[Image:Diagram_of_UK_School_System.svg|500px]]
<p>
The first years of education in Malta are done in [[kindergarten|Reception]]. Attendance is up to 5 years and not compulsory. Compulsory education starts at the age of 6 with primary education. Primary education lasts for 6 years. Following public examinations, students enter secondary education. Following a five-year course preparing for the "Secondary Education Certificate" (SEC), equivalent to the British [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE), students sit for final examinations (results are used in the school-leaving certificate), and in general also sit for the SEC examinations. SEC examinations require students to be aged 16 and over, or to have a school-leaving certificate. Students who have repeated years are therefore able to apportion their SEC examinations over the last two years at school.

[[Image:educationmalta.jpg|thumb|200px|Students during the Graduation Ceremony at the University of Malta.]]
Once compulsory secondary education ends, students may enter either in a vocational college such as [[MCAST]] or a [[Sixth Form]]. [[Sixth Form|Sixth forms]] provide a two-year course leading to the "Matriculation Certificate", which is the equivalent of the UK Advanced Level Examinations and Advanced Subsidiary Examinations. For students unsuccessful in their SEC examinations, there is the option of attending a Higher Secondary school, a sort of safety net to give students the possibility to catch up, where any core subjects (mathematics, English language, Maltese, and a natural science) previously failed are again taught at ordinary level in preparation for SEC examinations, while also teaching intermediate and advanced level subjects. Students may also choose to attend specialised private institutions preparing for diplomas, degrees and professional qualifications of foreign examination bodies in careers such as IT ([[London University]]), networking ([[CISCO]]), accountancy ([[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]]) and banking.

Tertiary education at diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate level is mainly provided by the [[University of Malta]] (UoM). Qualifications from the UoM are fully recognised internationally after its conversion to using the European [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits system. Admission requires a minimum overall C grade in the [[Matriculation Certificate]] and passes at ordinary level of the core subjects. Special course requirements are mostly based on single-subject results in the Matriculation Certificate. Some of the qualifications obtained from private institutions are also recognised. Full-time attendance by Maltese citizens is free-of-charge, while part-time (evening) attendance is not.

The [http://www.etc.gov.mt/ Employment and Training Corporation] (ETC) satisfies one of its dual roles by offering training for adults of any age and experience.  The University of Malta offers similar courses and also gives the option of entering normal full-/part-time courses as a ''mature student'' - persons aged 23 and over are exempted from satisfying the University entry requirements, though they still have to satisfy any special course requirements.

The adult [[literacy rate]] is 92.8%<!--CIA Factbook, August 2006. See external links-->.
