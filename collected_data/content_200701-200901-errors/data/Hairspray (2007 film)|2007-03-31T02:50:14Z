Tracy soon becomes a council member of [[The Buddy Dean Show]] parody The Corny Collins Show and becomes the target of the snooty teen queen Amber Von Tussle ([[Brittany Snow]]) and her equally-snooty mother Velma ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), but soon Amber loses her popular-guy boyfriend Link Larkin ([[Zac Efron]]) to Tracy. Can Tracy and her friends integrate Baltimore?
