'''James Wyllie'''(born [[July 6]] in [[Edinburgh]]; died [[April 5]], [[1899]]) was a British [[draughts]] player who is important to the history of the game. He is often nicknamed "Herd Laddie." The year of his birth is uncertain being either [[1818]] or [[1820]].

He was raised in [[Ayrshire]] where he got involved in draughts after initial discouragement. By his teens he was winning consistently against players much older than him. He later became a rival with Robert Martins for the next forty years with both men dominating the Scottish championship. By the [[1870s]] Wyllie began touring the world and was internationally known in the game.

He brought in plays and innovations that are still used today.
