It is the major cultural and educational center in the southwest region of the state and one of the most important in [[Acadiana]]. As of the 2000 [[census|U.S. census]], Lake Charles' population was 71,757. The city serves as the [[parish seat]] of [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu Parish]].

Lake Charles is the principal city of the [[Lake Charles Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes the parishes of Calcasieu and [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron]]. It is also part of the larger [[Lake Charles-Jennings Combined Statistical Area]].

The city is considered a major [[petrochemical]] refining center, [[casino|gaming center]], and home to [[McNeese State University]].

With over 75 festivals held annually, Lake Charles is referred to as the ''Festival Capital of Louisiana''. 

== History ==
=== 18th and 19th Centuries ===
==== Settlement and Incorporation ====  
While several [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes are known to have lived in the area of modern Lake Charles, the first [[Europe]]an settlers arrived in the 1760s. 

'''Martin LeBleu''' and his wife, Dela Marion, of [[Bordeaux, France]] were the first recorded Europeans to settle the area which they did in around [[1781]]. The area they settled is now known as the '''LeBleu Settlement'''. [[Charles Sallier]] married LeBleu's daughter, '''Catherine LeBleu'''. The Salliers built their home on the beach where Lake Charles now stands. By 1860 the area become known as '''Charles Town''' in Sallier's honor.

The Rio Hondo, which flowed through [[Lake Charles (body of water)|Lake Charles]], was later called ''Quelqueshue'', a Native American term meaning "Crying Eagle." This term would later lend itself to the name of the parish, [[Calcasieu Parish|Calcasieu]]. On [[March 7]], [[1861]], Lake Charles was officially incorporated as the town of '''Charleston, Louisiana'''.

==== Industrial Growth and the Civil War ====
[[Image:National Atlas Louisiana west trim.gif|thumb|320px|right| '''Lake Charles''' [lower left] is west of [[Lafayette, LA|Lafayette]] or [[Baton Rouge]], southwest of [[Alexandria, LA|Alexandria]] and south of [[Natchitoches, LA|Natchitoches]].  Roads also lead to 
[[De Ridder, LA|De Ridder]],
[[Kinder, LA|Kinder]], [[Eunice, LA|Eunice]],
[[Jennings, LA|Jennings]], [[Crowley, LA|Crowley]]
and [[Sulphur, LA|Sulphur]] to [[Orange, Texas]].]]

The city's growth was fairly slow until '''Captain Daniel Goos''', a [[Frisians|Frisian]] by birth, came to the city in 1855. Goos established a [[lumber|lumber mill]] and [[schooner|schooner dock]], now called '''Goosport'''. He promoted a profitable trade with [[Texas]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] ports by sending his schooner down river into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Until the arrival of Goos, a man named '''Jacob Ryan''' dominated the lumber industry. Between 1817 and 1855, the timber from [[Longleaf Pine|longleaf pine]] and bald cypress remained the city's primary economic industry.

Jacob Ryan convinced the state government to move the parish seat to Lake Charles from its former location at [[Marion, Louisiana|Marion]], a settlement about eight miles upriver. Later that year, Ryan and '''Samuel Kirby''' transferred the parish courthouse and jail by barge to Lake Charles, which was at that time still named Charleston. Six years after the city was incorporated, dissatisfaction over the name Charleston arose; on [[March 16]], [[1867]], Charleston, Louisiana, was incorporated into the town of Lake Charles.

By the time of the [[U.S. Civil War]], many Americans from the North, along with a large influx of continental Europeans and [[Jewish people|Jews]], had come to settle the area. Attitudes toward slavery in Lake Charles were mixed as slavery was secondary to business interests. In fact, fewer than 5% of the population were [[slavery|slaves]]. Many citizens became involved in the war, and young men from some local families served on the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate army]].  It is also known that some local families supported the cause of the Union.

==== After the Civil War ====
In the years following the Civil War, Lake Charles regained its status as a major lumber community. Especially in the 1880s, the city saw an increase in population and economic demand due largely due to an innovative advertising campaign by '''J.B. Watkins'''. With his astounding $200,000 campaign, the town grew 400% during this decade.

Using the pine wood from the city's mills, construction of large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions overwhelmed Lake Charles in the 1890s; carpenters struggled to outbuild each other with their use of elaborate fretwork and decoration, including spindles, newel posts, soldiers and paneled doors. The area of present-day Lake Charles located just east of downtown is known as the '''Charpentier District''' due to architecture during this period; ''charpentier'' means carpenter in French.

=== Twentieth Century ===
The courthouse donated by Ryan and Kirby was replaced many times, including a two-story cypress wood one in 1872, then a brick one in 1890. The 1890 courthouse was destroyed in the '''Great Fire of 1910'''. The historic Calcasieu Courthouse was completed in 1912, two months after the Louisiana legislature divided the former '''Imperial Calcasieu''' parish into the current parishes of [[Allen Parish|Allen]], [[Beauregard Parish|Beauregard]], [[Cameron Parish|Cameron]], [[Jefferson Davis Parish|Jefferson Davis]] and [[Calcasieu Parish|Calcasieu]].

After [[World War II]] Lake Charles experienced industrial growth with the onset of the petrochemical refining industries. The city grew to a height of 80,000 people in the early 1980s, but with economic recession, the population declined. As of the 2000 [[census]], the city had a total population of 71,757.

=== Present Day === 
[[Image:ritadestr1.jpg|thumb|250px|The destructive force of Hurricane Rita. Looking down the remains of the lakefront boardwalk toward the damaged Harrah's Lake Charles Casino property.]]
[[Pinnacle Entertainment]] opened their first riverboat [[casino]] in the Lake Charles area in May 2005. The name of the resort, [[L'Auberge du Lac Resort|L'Auberge du Lac]], comes from the [[French language|French]] for "The Inn on the Lake." The casino includes an 18-hole, championship [[golf course]] designed by [[Tom Fazio]], several dining venues, a spa and salon, a pool area complete with lazy river, and several retail stores. It employs over 2000 citizens.

Lake Charles suffered extensive damage from [[Hurricane Rita]], which struck the city as a Category 2 hurricane early on [[September 24]], [[2005]]. On [[September 22]], Mayor Randy Roach ordered a mandatory evacuation of Lake Charles, and approximately 90% of the residents evacuated prior to the storm. Evacuees were asked not to return for 48 hours, due to the wind damage and flooding. There was extensive damage to the city's [[electrical grid]] as some areas took as long as three weeks to restore power. Many apartment residents had to be evicted because of the mold caused by the [[hurricane]]. 

The Lake Charles American Press newspaper has a hurricane blog posted on the internet which captures the essence of the events that occurred in this significant event which impacted the City's history and residents forever:  http://americanpress.blogspot.com

As part of the city's recovery from [[Hurricane Rita]], elected officials proposed a plan to renovate the downtown area to make it more pedestrian-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. Charrettes were held presenting architectural concept drawings and ideas of what downtown Lake Charles could look like in future years. Of primary concern was quality and affordable housing to help revitalize the area, and at the same time provide more housing for the housing shortage in the last few years. A parish-wide ballot initiative to increase sales and property taxes for 20 years to fund this proposal and numerous local road projects was rejected by taxpayers on [[July 15]], [[2006]].

On [[June 20]], [[2006]] a [[Citgo]] Petroleum Plant located in [[Westlake, Louisiana|Westlake]] released between 15,000 and 18,000 barrels of [[oil]] into the Calcasieu Ship Channel. The [[United States Coast Guard]] was called in to contain the spilled oil which flowed down the [[Calcasieu River]]; closures of many waterways included the Calcasieu River Channel and one mile of the [[Gulf Intracoastal Waterway]]. The Port of Lake Charles remained closed for some time after the disaster due to contamination.<ref>{{cite news

Oil prices surged to over $74 per barrel in part due to the Citgo spillage. The Calcasieu Refining  Co., which normally processes 76,500 barrels a day, was at low levels weeks after the accident.<ref>{{cite news

[[Image:Lake Charles development.jpg|thumb|centre|400px|One idea for the revitalization of downtown Lake Charles circa March 2007.]]

==Geography and Climate==
The city is located on the banks of the [[Calcasieu River]] in southwestern Louisiana, and borders both Lake Charles and [[Prien Lake]]. It is a port on a deep-water channel to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and was first settled in [[1852]].

Lake Charles is located at {{coor dms|30|12|53|N|93|12|31|W|city}} (30.214656, -93.208537){{GR|1}} and has an elevation of {{Ft to m|13}}{{GR|3}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 42.5&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (110.2&nbsp;[[km²]]), of which, 40.2&nbsp;square miles (104.0&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 2.4&nbsp;square miles (6.1&nbsp;km²) of it (5.57%) is water.

Primarily the city is located on a plain about 30 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. Many pine trees used to grow around the waterways, and some still do. Few hills are to be seen, except when one is near the water, or in Moss Bluff.

=== Mardi Gras ===
[[Mardi Gras]] in Southwest Louisiana has a colorful history dating back to [[1882]], when Momus, King of Mardi Gras, landed his royal yacht at the foot of Pujo Street in downtown Lake Charles.
 
Throughout the two World Wars, [[Mardi Gras]] was downsized which lead to a lack of participation by the area's youth. However, an interest to redevelop the festivities arose, and the first Mardi Gras Ball in the Lake Charles area was staged in [[1964]].

The full revival of [[Mardi Gras]] in Lake Charles was not realized until 1979, when several [[Krewe]] captains formed the "Krewe of Krewes" with the prime purpose of parading and promoting Mardi Gras for local residents. In [[1985]], '''Mardi Gras of Imperial Calcasieu, Inc.''' was formed by a group of civic-minded volunteers to further aid in the preservation of this festival.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/7288/lcmardigras.html "History of Mardi Gras in Southwest Louisiana."]</ref>
