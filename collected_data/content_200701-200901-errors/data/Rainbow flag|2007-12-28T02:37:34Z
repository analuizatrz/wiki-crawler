[[Image:PACE-flag.svg|thumb|The actual rainbow colors in the PACE flag ([[Italian language|Italian]] for '[[peace]]')]]
A '''rainbow flag''' is a multi-colored flag consisting of stripes in the colors of the [[rainbow]]. Not all, however, use the actual [[color#Physics of color|basic colors]] red, orange, yellow, green, [[cyan]], blue and violet, nor the [[Rainbow#Remembering the sequence of colors|traditional rainbow colors]] of [[red]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], [[indigo]] and [[Violet (color)|violet]] or [[purple]].

The use of rainbow flags has a long tradition; they are displayed in many cultures around the world as a sign of diversity and inclusiveness, of hope and of yearning.

There are several unrelated rainbow flags in use today. The most widely known is perhaps the [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|pride flag]] representing [[gay pride]]. The [[Peace rainbow flag|peace flag]] is especially popular in [[Italy]] and the [[International Co-operative Alliance|cooperative]] flag symbolizes international cooperation. It is also used by Andean people to represent the legacy of the [[Inca empire]] ([[Wiphala]]) and Andean movements.

==Rainbow flags in various cultures and movements==
===Early European history===
The use of rainbow flags as a sign of diversity, inclusiveness, hope and of yearning has a long history. This denotation goes back to the rainbow as a symbol of [[Bible|biblical]] promise, when [[God]] used the rainbow as a sign to [[Noah]] that there would never be a flood like the one that happened.<ref>[http://christianity.about.com/od/symbolspictures/ig/Christian-Symbols-Glossary/Christian-Rainbow.htm Christian symbols Glossary]</ref><ref>[http://goodnewspirit.com/rainbow.htm Symbol of God's Everlasting Covenant with Mankind]</ref> The reformer [[Thomas Müntzer]] (1489-1525) connected socially revolutionary claims with his preaching of the gospel. He is often portrayed with a rainbow flag in his hand. The Thomas Müntzer statue in the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Stolberg, Saxony-Anhalt|Stolberg]] also shows him holding a rainbow flag in his hand.

In the German [[Peasants' War]] of the 16th century, the rainbow flag together with the peasants' boot ("Bundschuh") was used as the sign of a new era, of hope and of social change.

===South America (Pre-Columbian)===
[[Image:Banner of the Inca Empire.svg|thumb|[[Wiphala]]]]
{{Main|Wiphala|Flag of Cusco}}
A flag with a seven-striped rainbow design is used in [[Peru]] <ref>[http://flagspot.net/flags/xi.html Flagspot.net]</ref> and [[Ecuador]] to represent [[Inca Empire|Tawantin Suyu]], or Inca territory. The use of the flag has its origin in Inca culture and it is called [[whipala]]. Even today in the city of [[Cusco]], [[Peru]] it is common to see the flag around the city displayed even in government buildings and in Cusco main square. The meaning behind the whipala has to be found in connection with the Incas and with the cosmovision and philosophy of Andean indigenous culture.

Some argue that there is no historical reference to an Inca or Tawantisuyo flag or banner until the early 1920s; but other specialists suggest that there are chronicles and some references that support the idea of a banner attributable to the Inca. In 1534 during the invasion and occupation of the city of Qusqu today Cusco, the Spaniards found the first resistance of qhishwa-ayrnaras and saw between the multitude, objects similar to the flag of strips and pictures of seven colors of the rainbow. The existence and the use of this emblem probably has been from the same creation of [[Tiwanaku]] for more than 2000 years. <ref>[http://www.indigenas.bioetica.org/wiphala.htm History of Wiphala]</ref> <ref>[http://www.backspace.com/notes/2005/06/ Social Design Notes: The Wiphala]</ref>

===Buddhism (1880)===
[[Image:Flag of Buddhism.svg|thumb|[[Buddhist flag]]]]
{{main|Prayer flag|Buddhist flag}}
Tibetan [[prayer flag]]s are colourful panels or rectangular cloths strung along mountain ridges and peaks in the [[Himalayas]] to bless the surrounding countryside. In the [[United States]], multi-coloured flags often represent the Buddhist community. While Tibetan prayer flags are much older, the Buddhist flag was designed in 1880. <ref>[http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/general_symbols_buddhism.html Buddhist Symbols]</ref>

===Cooperative movement (1921)===
[[Image:ICA flag.svg|thumb|[[International Co-operative Alliance]]]]
A seven-colour rainbow flag is a common symbol of the international [[Cooperative]] movement. The rainbow flag has been the co-operative emblem since 1921 when the International Co-operative Congress of World Co-op Leaders met in Basel, Switzerland to identify and define the growing co-operative movement’s common values and ideals to help unite co-ops around the world.

In Essen, Germany in 1922, the [[International Co-operative Alliance]] (ICA) designed an international co-op symbol and a flag for the first "Co-operators' Day," which was held in July 1923. After some experiments with different designs, a famous French co-operator, Professor [[Charles Gide]], suggested using the seven colours of the rainbow for the flag. He pointed out that the rainbow symbolized unity in diversity and the power of light, enlightenment and progress. The first co-op rainbow flag was completed in 1924 and was adopted as an official symbol of the international co-operative movement in 1925.

The ICA has been flying a flag with its official logo since April 2001, when its Board decided to replace the traditional rainbow flag. Its use by a number of non-cooperative groups led to confusion in several countries around the world. The ICA's official flag was changed to clearly promote and strengthen the co-operative image, but still uses the rainbow image. Other organizations sometimes use the traditional rainbow flag as a symbol of co-operation.

Like the [[rainbow]], this flag is a symbol of hope and peace. The seven colours from flags around the world fly in harmony. Each of the seven colours in the co-operative flag have been assigned the following meaning: <ref>[http://www.ica.coop/ica/index.html Official website of ICA]</ref>
* red: stands for courage;
* orange: offers the vision of possibilities;
* yellow: represents the challenge that GREEN has kindled;
* green: indicates a challenge to co-operators to strive for growth of membership and of understanding of the aims and values of co-operation;
* sky blue: suggests far horizons, the need to provide education and help less fortunate people and strive toward global unity.
* dark blue: suggests pessimism: a reminder that less fortunate people have needs that may be met through the benefits of cooperation.
* violet: represents warmth, beauty, and friendship.

===Meher Baba (1924)===
[[Image:Meher Baba's flag.gif|thumb|[[Meher Baba's flag]]]]
{{main|Meher Baba's flag}}
[[Meher Baba]] designed a rainbow flag on April 23, [[1924]]. It is flown each year near his [[samadhi]] (tomb-shrine) in [[Meherabad]], [[India]] during the week of [[Amartithi]] (the anniversary of his death on January 31, 1969). Baba explained the symbolism, saying, "The colors in the flag signify man's rise from the grossest of impressions of lust and anger – symbolized by red – to the culmination in the highest state of spirituality and oneness with God – symbolized by sky blue." <ref> ''Lord Meher'', by Bhau Kalchuri, Manifestation Inc. 1986, p. 618</ref> <ref>[http://www.jaibaba.com/babaflag.html The History of Meher Baba's Rainbow Flag]</ref>

===Peace movement (1961)===
[[Image:PACE-flag.svg|thumb|[[Peace rainbow flag|PACE flag]] ([[Italian language|Italian]] for '[[peace]]')]]
{{main|Peace rainbow flag}}

This rainbow flag in [[Italy]] was first used in a peace march in [[1961]], inspired by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against [[nuclear weapon]]s. It became popular with the ''Pace da tutti i balconi'' ("peace from every balcony") campaign in [[2002]], started as a protest against the impending [[war in Iraq]]. The most common variety has seven colours, purple, blue, [[azure (color)|azure]], green, yellow, orange and red, and is emblazoned in bold with the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''PACE'', meaning "peace". <ref>[http://www.bandieredipace.org/ Bandiere di Pace.org] ('Flags of Peace' in Italian)</ref> <ref>[http://www.amnesty.no/web.nsf/pages/494DD08999FC10CEC1256D3D00328635 Amnesty International]</ref>

Common variations include moving the purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white stripe on top (the original flag from the 60s had a white stripe on top). This flag has been adopted internationally as a symbol of the [[peace movement]].

=== LGBT pride (1978) ===
[[Image:Gay flag.svg|thumb|[[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|LGBT flag]]]]
{{Main|Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)}}

The rainbow flag, sometimes called 'the freedom flag', was popularized as a symbol of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) [[Gay pride|pride]] and diversity by [[San Francisco]] artist Gilbert Baker in 1978. The different colours symbolize diversity in the [[gay community]], and the flag is used predominantly at [[gay pride]] events and in [[gay village]]s worldwide in various forms including banners, clothing and jewelry. For the 25th Anniversary of the [[Stonewall riots]] held in 1996 in New York city a mile-long rainbow flag was created and post-parade cut up in sections that have since been used around the world. 

Originally created with eight colors, [[pink]] and [[turquoise]] were removed for production purposes and as of 2006, it consists of six coloured stripes of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. It is most commonly flown with the red stripe on top, as the colours appear in a natural rainbow.<ref>[http://www.fotw.us/flags/qq-rb_h.html History of the Gay Pride Rainbow Flag]</ref>

===Jewish Autonomous Oblast (1996)===
[[Image:Flag of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.svg|thumb|[[Flag of Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]]]
{{Main|Flag of Jewish Autonomous Oblast}}

Another variation of rainbow flag is used by [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], situated in the [[Far Eastern Federal District]] of [[Russia]], by the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] border. The stripes symbolize the rainbow. The white field could remind us of the white field of the Israeli flag. Proportions 2:3. Adopted first of October 1996. <ref>[http://www.flags-of-the-world.net/flags/ru-yev.html Jewish Autonomous Region (Russia)]</ref>

The [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] has a flag with a seven-colour rainbow. The number of colours is meant to symbolize the seven-branched Jewish [[Menorah]].

===Pachakutik political party===
{{Main|Pachakutik Plurinational Unity Movement – New Country}}

===Noachides===
{{Main|B'nei Noah}}
