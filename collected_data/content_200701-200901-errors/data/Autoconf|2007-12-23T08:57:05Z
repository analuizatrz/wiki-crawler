'''Autoconf''' is a tool for producing [[shell script]]s that automatically configure software [[source code]] packages to adapt to many kinds of [[UNIX-like]] systems.  The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf are independent of it when they are run.

Together with [[Automake]] and [[Libtool]], Autoconf forms the [[GNU build system]].

Autoconf makes use of [[GNU m4]] to transform a user-written 'configure.ac' (formerly, and on older projects, called 'configure.in') file to a portable shell script called 'configure'.  The 'configure' script runs non-interactively, and generates customized headers and [[makefile]]s derived from pre-written templates. You could say that Autoconf [[compiler|compiles]] the [[m4 (language)|M4]] program in 'configure.ac' into a shell script.

Autoconf was begun in the summer of 1991 by David Mackenzie to support his work at the [[Free Software Foundation]].  In the subsequent years it grew to include enhancements from a variety of authors and became the most widely used build configuration system for writing portable free or open source software.

== Approach ==
Autoconf is similar to the [[Metaconfig]] package used by [[Perl]].  The [[imake]] system formerly used by the [[X Window System]] (up to X11R6.9) is closely related, but has a different philosophy.

The Autoconf approach to [[Porting|portability]] is to test for [[feature]]s, not for [[version]]s. For example, the native C compiler on SunOS 4 did not support [[C (programming language)|ISO C]]. However, it is possible for the user or administrator to have installed an ISO C compliant compiler.  A pure version-based approach would not detect the presence of the ISO C compiler, but a feature testing approach would be able to discover the ISO C compiler the user had installed. The rationale of this approach is to gain the following advantages:

* the configure script can get reasonable results on newer or unknown systems
* it allows [[system administrator|administrator]]s to customize their machines and have the configure script take advantage of the customizations
* there's no need to keep track of minute details of versions, patch numbers, etc., to figure out whether a particular feature is supported or not
