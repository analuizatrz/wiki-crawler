Tutu was elected and ordained the first black South African [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Cape Town]], South Africa, and [[Primate (religion)|primate]] of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa (now the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]]). He received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1984, the [[Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism]], and the Magubela prize for liberty in 1986.  He is committed to stopping global [[AIDS]] and has served as the honorary chairman for the Global AIDS Alliance. In February 2007 he was awarded the [[Gandhi Peace Prize]] by [[Abdul Kalam|Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam]], President of [[India]].

He was generally credited with coining the term [[Rainbow Nation]] as a metaphor for post-apartheid [[South Africa]] after 1994 under [[African National Congress]] rule.  The expression has since entered mainstream consciousness to describe South Africa's ethnic diversity. Tutu is widely regarded as "South Africa's moral conscience".<ref name = usazim>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-03-16-tutu-zimbabwe_N.htm |title=Archbishop Desmond Tutu lambasts African silence on Zimbabwe|date= 2007|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>

==Background==
Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Transvaal]] on 7 October, 1931, the son of Zacheriah Zililo Tutu. Tutu's  family moved to [[Johannesburg]] when he was 12 years old. Although he wanted to become a [[physician]], his family could not afford the training, and he followed his father's footsteps into [[teaching]]. Tutu studied at the Pretoria Bantu Normal College from 1951 through 1953, and went on to teach at Johannesburg Bantu High School and at Munsieville High School in [[Pietermaritzburg]]. However, he resigned following the passage of the [[Bantu Education Act]], in protest of the poor educational prospects for African South Africans. He continued his studies, this time in [[theology]], at St Peter's Theology College in Rosettenville and in 1960 was ordained as an [[Anglican]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] following in the footsteps of his mentor and fellow activist, [[Trevor Huddleston]]. 
 
Tutu then travelled to [[King's College London]], (1962–1966), where he received his [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree]]s in Theology. During this time he worked as a part-time curate, first at [[St Albans Cathedral]] and then at St. Mary's in [[Bletchingley]], Surrey. He later returned to South Africa and from 1967 until 1972 used his lectures to highlight the circumstances of the African population. He wrote a letter to [[B.J. Vorster|Prime Minister Vorster]], in which he described the situation in South Africa as a "[[gunpowder|powder barrel]] that can explode at any time."  The letter was never answered. He became [[chaplain]] at the [[University of Fort Hare]] in 1967, a hotbed of dissent and one of the few quality universities for African students in the southern part of Africa. From 1970 to 1972, Tutu lectured at the [[National University of Lesotho]] .

Tutu faced a difficult balancing act: voicing black discontent while leading a largely white parish. Alternately charming and challenging them, he appealed to their Afrikaner heritage, recalling that their forebears had endured British concentration camps. Somewhat to the bewilderment of other black leaders, he patiently courted Vorster’s successor, [[P. W. Botha]], explaining that even [[Moses]] continued to reason with Pharaoh. But white liberals grew nervous when Tutu called for a boycott of South African products.<ref name=tutustory/>

In 1972 Tutu returned to the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where he was appointed vice-director of the Theological Education Fund of the [[World Council of Churches]], at [[Bromley]] in [[Kent]]. He returned to South Africa in 1975 and was appointed Anglican [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Johannesburg]]—the first African person to hold that position. 

In 1984 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace, as a gesture of support for him and The South African Council of Churches which he led at that time. 

In 1987 Tutu was awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award]]. It was named after a 1963 [[encyclical]] letter by [[Pope John XXIII]] that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. [[Pacem in Terris]] is [[Latin]] for 'Peace on Earth.'

Tutu supported disinvestment, although it hit the poor hardest for if disinvestment threw blacks out of work, Tutu argued, at least they would be suffering "with a purpose". Disinvestment did succeed, causing the value of the Rand to plunge and pressuring the government toward reform. Tutu pressed the advantage and organised peaceful marches which brought thirty thousand people onto the streets of [[Cape Town]]. That was the turning point: within months, [[Mandela]] was freed from prison, and apartheid was beginning to crumble.<ref name=tutustory>{{cite web |url=http://www.christiancentury.org/article.lasso?id=2441|author=Wood, Lawrence|title=Tutu's story|date=2006-10-17| publisher=The Christian Century|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>

==Personal life==  
He has been married to [[Leah Nomalizo Tutu]] since 2 July 1955. They have four children:  Trevor Thamsanqa Tutu, Theresa Thandeka Tutu, Naomi Nontombi Tutu and Mpho Andrea Tutu, all of whom attended the [[Waterford Kamhlaba]] School in [[Swaziland]]. In 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and underwent successful treatment in the United States of America. He subsequently became patron of the South African Prostate Cancer Foundation which was established in 2007.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prostatecancerfoundation.co.za/A_Aboutus_Media.asp |title=Taking the fight against prostate cancer to South Africans|date=2007-03-03|publisher=Prostate Cancer Foundation of South Africa|accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref>

In 1998, he was appointed as the [[Robert W. Woodruff|Robert R Woodruff]] Visiting Professor at [[Emory University]], [[Atlanta]]. He returned to [[Emory University]] the following year as the William R Cannon Visiting Distinguished Professor. Since 2004, he has been a Visiting Professor at [[King's College London]].

In Spring 2007, he joined 600 college students and sailed around the world with [[Semester at Sea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=621 |title=Nobel Peace Prize Winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu to Sail with Semester at Sea for Entire Spring Semester|date=2006-09-26|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=2008-01-05}}</ref>

==Political work==
{{Apartheid}}
In 1976 protests in [[Soweto]], also known as the [[Soweto Riots]], against the government's use of [[Afrikaans]] as a compulsory medium of instruction in black schools became a massive uprising against apartheid.  From then on Tutu supported an economic [[boycott]] of his country. He vigorously opposed the "constructive engagement" policy of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration in the United States, which advocated "friendly persuasion."  

Desmond Tutu was [[Bishop]] of [[Lesotho]] from 1976 until 1978, when he became [[Secretary-General]] of the [[South African Council of Churches]]. From this position, he was able to continue his work against apartheid with agreement from nearly all churches. Tutu consistently advocated [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]] between all parties involved in apartheid through his writings and lectures at home and abroad. Though he was most firm in denouncing South Africa's white-ruled government, Tutu was also harsh in his criticism of the violent tactics of some anti-apartheid groups such as the [[African National Congress]] and denounced [[terrorism]] and [[Communism]].

Tutu's opposition was vigorous and unequivocal, and he was outspoken both in South Africa and abroad, often comparing apartheid to [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. As a result the government twice revoked his passport, and he was jailed briefly in 1980 after a protest march. It was thought by many that Tutu's increasing international reputation and his rigorous advocacy of non-violence protected him from harsher penalties.

On [[16 October]] [[1984]], Tutu was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].  The Nobel Committee cited his "role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1984/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize for 1984|publisher=[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> 

In 1985, Tutu was appointed the Bishop of [[Johannesburg]] before he became the first black person to lead the Anglican Church in [[South Africa]] on [[7 September]] [[1986]]. From 1987 to 1997 he was president of the All Africa Conference of Churches. In 1989 he was invited to [[Birmingham, England|Birmingham]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] as part of Citywide Christian Celebrations.  Tutu and his wife visited a number of establishments including the [[Nelson Mandela]] School in [[Sparkbrook]].

In 1990, Tutu and the ex-Vice Chancellor of the [[University of the Western Cape]] Professor Jakes Gerwel founded the Desmond Tutu Educational Trust. The Trust was established to fund developmental programmes in tertiary education and provides capacity building at 17 historically disadvantaged institutions. In 2001, the Trust, with funding from the [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]], launched the Desmond Tutu Footprints of the Legends Awards which recognises leadership in combating prejudice, human rights, research and poverty eradication. 

Tutu's work as a mediator in order to prevent all-out racial war was evident at the funeral of [[South African Communist Party]] leader [[Chris Hani]] in 1993. Tutu spurred a crowd of 120,000 to repeat after him the chants, over and over: "We will be free!", "All of us!", "Black and white together!" and finished his speech saying:
<blockquote>
"We are the rainbow people of God! We are unstoppable! Nobody can stop us on our march to victory! No one, no guns, nothing! Nothing will stop us, for we are moving to freedom! We are moving to freedom and nobody can stop us! For God is on our side!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1945580,00.html |author=Carlin, John|title=Former aide John Allen’s authorised biography offers an intimate view of Desmond Tutu|date=2006-11-12| publisher=The Observer|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1993, he was a patron of the Cape Town Olympic Bid Committee. In 1994 he was a appointed a patron of the World Campaign Against Military and Nuclear Collaboration with South Africa, Beacon Millennium and Action from Ireland. In 1995 he became a patron of the American Harmony Child Foundation and the Hospice Association of Southern Africa. 
 
After the fall of apartheid, he headed the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], for which he was awarded the [[Sydney Peace Prize]] in 1999. In 2000, he founded the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation to raise funds for the Desmond Tutu Peace Centre in Cape Town. In 2002, he launched the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation USA, which is designed to work with universities nationwide to create leadership academies emphasising peace, social justice and reconciliation. 

In 2003, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the [[International Criminal Court]]'s Trust Fund for Victims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGIOR300072003?open&of=ENG-391|title=Amnesty International welcomes the election of a Board of Directors|date=2003-09-12|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> He was named a member of the UN advisory panel on genocide prevention in 2006.<ref name=bday/>

== Politics and political views ==
=== United Nations ===
The Nobel laureate has expressed support for the [[West Papua]]n independence movement, criticizing the [[United Nations]]' role in the takeover of West Papua by [[Indonesia]].  Tutu said:  "For many years the people of South Africa suffered under the yoke of oppression and apartheid. Many people continue to suffer brutal oppression, where their fundamental dignity as human beings is denied. One such people is the people of West Papua."

=== G8 ===
Before the [[31st G8 summit]] at Gleneagles, [[Scotland]] in 2005, Tutu called on world leaders to promote free trade with poorer countries. Tutu also called on an end to expensive taxes on anti-AIDS drugs. Tutu said:
<blockquote>
"I would hope they would begin to say, 'lets to do something about subsidies'. You ask the so-called-developing world, 'Why can't you people produce more?' - and they produce - and then they find that the markets have barriers that are put down or are clobbered twice over. I would hope that people would realise that ultimately it is in their own interest to begin to have a more equitable international economic system. So I hope you people here in Scotland will come out and say G8, do something useful."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4356821.stm |title=Archbishop Tutu calls for G8 help|date=2005-03-17|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Following this summit, he G8 leaders promised to increase aid to developing countries by $48bn a year by 2010. Further, they gave their word of honor that they would do the best they could to achieve universal access to prevention and treatment for the millions and millions of people globally threatened by HIV/AIDS.

Before the [[32nd G8 summit]] in [[Germany]] in 2007, Tutu called on the G8 to focus on poverty in the Third World. Following the [[Millennium Summit|United Nations Millennium Summit]] in 2000, it appeared that world leaders were determined as never before to set and meet specific goals regarding extreme poverty.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.worldaidscampaign.info/index.php/en/media__1/press_releases/desmond_tutu_keep_your_promises|title=Desmond Tutu: Keep your Promises|date=2006-10-19|publisher=World Aids Campaign|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>

=== Zimbabwe ===
Tutu has been vocal in his criticism of human rights abuses in [[Zimbabwe]] as well as the [[South Africa|South African]] government's policy of quiet diplomacy towards Zimbabwe. In 2007 he said the "quiet diplomacy" pursued by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) had "not worked at all" and he called on Britain and the West to pressure [[SADC]], including South Africa, which was chairing talks between President Mugabe's [[Zanu-PF]] party and the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change]], to set firm deadlines for action, with consequences if they were not met.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/19/wtutu119.xml|title=Zimbabwe needs your help, Tutu tells Brown|date= 2007-09-19| publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref> Tutu has often criticized [[Robert Mugabe]] in the past and he once described the autocratic leader as "a cartoon figure of an archetypical African dictator".<ref name=usazim/> Mugabe, on the other hand, has called Tutu an "angry, evil and embittered little bishop".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2631943.ece|title=Working with a rabble-rouser|date= 2007-10-10| author=John Allen|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

<blockquote>
"We Africans should hang our heads in shame. How can what is happening in Zimbabwe elicit hardly a word of concern let alone condemnation from us leaders of Africa? After the horrible things done to hapless people in Harare, has come the recent crackdown on members of the opposition ... what more has to happen before we who are leaders, religious and political, of our mother Africa are moved to cry out 'Enough is enough?."<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/special%20projects/tutu-d/timeline-tutu.html|title=Desmond Tutu Quotes|date= 2007| publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>
</blockquote>

He has often stated that all leaders in Africa should condemn Zimbabwe: "What an awful blot on our copy book. Do we really care about human rights, do we care that people of flesh and blood, fellow Africans, are being treated like rubbish, almost worse than they were ever treated by rabid racists?"<ref name=usazim/> 

After the Zimbabwe elections in April 2008, Tutu expressed his hope that Mugabe would step down after reported losing the elections. 
<blockquote>
"That is democracy. Democracy is, you change government when people decide. I mean when your time is over, your time is over. We hope the transition will be a peaceful one, relatively peaceful, and that Mr Mugabe will step down with dignity, gracefully."<ref name=retire>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=739329|title=‘Mugabe must step down with dignity’|date= 2008-04-02| publisher=The Times|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Tutu called Mugabe "someone we were very proud of", as he "did a fantastic job, and it’s such a great shame, because he had a wonderful legacy. If he had stepped down ten or so years ago he would be held in very, very high regard. And I still want to say we must honour him for the things that he did do, and just say what a shame."<ref name=retire/>

Tutu stated that he feared that riots would break out in Zimbabwe if the election results were ignored. He proposed that a peace-keeping force should be sent to the region to ensure stability. 
<blockquote>
"Anything that would save the possibilities of bloodshed, of conflict, I am quite willing to support. The people of Zimbabwe have suffered enough, and we don’t...want any more possibilities of bloodshed. In a fraught situation such as we have had in Zimbabwe, anything that is helping towards a move, a transition, from the repression to the possibilities of democracy and freedom, oh, for goodness sake, please let us accept that."<ref name=retire/>
</blockquote>

=== On slavery === 
In June 1999, Tutu was invited to give the annual Wilberforce Lecture in [[Kingston upon Hull]], commemorating the life and achievements of the anti-slavery campaigner [[William Wilberforce]]. Tutu used the occasion to praise the people of the city for their traditional support of freedom and for standing with the people of South Africa in their fight against apartheid. He was also presented with the [[freedom of the city]].
[[Image:Cover Volume I Issue 2.jpg|thumb|The Fall 2004 issue of ''Greater Good'' magazine]]

=== On children === 
In 2005, Tutu launched a global campaign, organised by [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan]], to ensure that all children were registered at birth, as an unregistered child did not officially exist and was vulnerable to traffickers and during disasters. Tutu said a birth document was important because it "proves who you are." Without it, children are often barred from education, health care, and citizenship. Tutu said:
<blockquote>
"It is, in a very real sense, a matter of life and death. The unregistered child is a nonentity. The unregistered child does not exist. How can we live with the knowledge that we could have made a difference?."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4289393.stm |title=Tutu calls for child registration|date= 2005-02-22| publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> 
</blockquote>

=== Social psychology ===
Tutu has contributed to the field of [[social psychology]]. His writing appeared in Greater Good Magazine, published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  His contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships. His most recent article with Greater Good magazine is titled: "Why to Forgive", which examines how forgiveness is not only personally rewarding, but also politically necessary in allowing South Africa to have a new beginning. However, Tutu states that forgiveness is not turning a blind eye to wrongs; true reconciliation exposes the awfulness, the abuse, the pain, the hurt, the truth. It could even sometimes make things worse. It is a risky undertaking but in the end it is worthwhile, because in the end only an honest confrontation with reality can bring healing.

=== On Israel and relationship with the Jewish community ===
Tutu has spoken of the significant role [[Jew]]s played in the anti-Apartheid struggle in South Africa, has voiced support for [[Israel]]'s security concerns, and has spoken against tactics of [[suicide attack|suicide bombing]] and incitement to hatred.<ref name="tutu">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/comment/0,10551,706911,00.html|title=Apartheid in the Holy Land|date= 2002-04-29|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> He is also an active and prominent proponent of the campaign for [[Economic and political boycotts of Israel|divestment from Israel]]<ref name=tutuNation>{{cite journal

In 1988, the [[American Jewish Committee]] noted that Tutu was strongly critical of Israel's military and other connections with apartheid-era South Africa, and quoted him as saying that [[Zionism]] has "very many parallels with racism", on the grounds that it "excludes people on ethnic or other grounds over which they have no control".  While the AJC was critical of some of Tutu's views, it was dismissive of "insidious rumours" that he had made anti-Semitic statements.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Shimoni| first = Gideon| title = South African Jews and the Apartheid Crisis| journal = American Jewish Year Book|volume = 88| pages = 50| publisher = American Jewish Committee| date = 1988| url = http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1988_3_SpecialArticles.pdf | format = [[PDF]]| accessdate =  }}</ref>  The precise wording of Tutu's statement has been reported differently in different sources.

Tutu preached a message of forgiveness during a 1989 trip to Israel's [[Yad Vashem]] museum, saying "Our Lord would say that in the end the positive thing that can come is the spirit of forgiving, not forgetting, but the spirit of saying: God, this happened to us.  We pray for those who made it happen, help us to forgive them and help us so that we in our turn will not make others suffer."<ref name=forgive>{{cite news|last =|first =|title = Tutu Urges Jews to Forgive The Nazis|publisher =San Francisco Chronicle| date = 1989-12-27| url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Some found this statement offensive, with Rabbi Marvin Hier of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] calling it "a gratuitous insult to Jews and victims of Nazism everywhere."<ref>{{cite news|last =|first =|title = Tutu assailed|page=13 |publisher =Chicago Sun-Times| date = 1989-12-30| url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Tutu was subjected to racial slurs during this visit to Israel, with vandals writing "Black Nazi pig" on the walls of the St. George's Cathedral in East Jerusalem, where he was staying.<ref name=forgive/>

In 2002, when delivering a public lecture in support of divestment, Tutu said "My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they turned their backs on their profound and noble religious traditions? Have they forgotten that God cares deeply about the downtrodden?"<ref name="tutu"/>  He argued that Israel could never live in security by oppressing another people, and continued, "People are scared in this country [the US], to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful - very powerful. Well, so what? For goodness sake, this is God's world! We live in a moral universe. The apartheid government was very powerful, but today it no longer exists.

Also in 2003, Archbishop Tutu received an International Advocate for Peace Award from the [[Cardozo School of Law]], an affiliate of [[Yeshiva University]], sparking scattered student protests and condemnations from representatives of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Anti-Defamation League.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=7706&print=yes |title=Tutu Honor Too Too Much?|date=|publisher=Jewish Week|accessdate=}}</ref> A 2006 opinion piece in the ''Jerusalem Post'' newspaper described him as "a friend, albeit a misguided one, of Israel and the Jewish people".<ref>{{cite news|author=Derfner, Larry|title=Anti-Semite and Jew|date=2006-10-15|publisher=Jerusalem Post|page=15|accessdate=}}</ref> The [[Zionist Organization of America]] has led a campaign to protest Tutu's appearances at [[North America]]n campuses.

In October 2007, Tutu visited [[Boston, Massachusetts]] where he sparked controversy after speaking at a conference entitled ''The Apartheid Paradigm in Palestine-Israel''. Members of Boston's Jewish community criticized Tutu's comparison of Israel with Apartheid in South Africa, saying drawing such a parallel was inappropriate and unfair.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wbur.org/news/2007/71853_20071030.asp |title=Tutu Advises Boston Youth|date=2007-10-30|publisher=WBUR|accessdate=}}</ref>

====Beit Hanoun====
Desmond Tutu was named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to the [[Gaza Strip]] town of [[Beit Hanoun]], where, in a [[Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident|November 2006 incident]] the [[Israel Defense Forces]] killed 19 civilians after troops wound up a week-long incursion aimed at curbing [[2006 Israel-Gaza conflict|Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel]] from the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1162378513178 | title=Tutu to head UN rights mission to Gaza |date=2006-11-29| last = Slosberg  | first = Jacob| publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=}}</ref> Tutu planned to travel to the Palestinian territory to "assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways and means to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli assaults," according to the president of the UN [[Human Rights Council]], [[Luis Alfonso De Alba]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881856613&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull| title=Israel may give no-no to Tutu's trip to Beit Hanun|date=2006-12-09| coauthors =Keinon, Herb | last = Hoffman| first = Gil| publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=}}</ref> Israeli officials expressed concern that the report would be biased against Israel.

Tutu cancelled the trip in mid-December, saying that Israel had refused to grant him the necessary travel clearance after more than a week of discussions. A spokesman from the Israeli foreign ministry indicated that no final decision had been made, to which Tutu responded, "At times ''not'' making a decision ''is'' making a decision. We couldn't obviously wait in limbo indefinitely."

===War on Terror===
[[Image:Desmond Tutu and George Bush.jpg|thumb|Tutu and USA President [[George W. Bush]] on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair]]'']]
In January 2003, Tutu attacked British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair|Tony Blair's]] stance in supporting American President [[George W. Bush]] over Iraq. The alliance of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States of America]] led to the outbreak of the [[Iraq War]] later that year. Tutu asked why Iraq was being singled out when [[Europe]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] also had weapons of mass destruction. Tutu demanded:<blockquote>
"When does compassion, when does morality, when does caring come in? I just hope that one day that people will realise that peace is a far better path to follow. Many, many of us are deeply saddened to see a great country such as the United States aided and abetted extraordinarily by Britain. I have a great deal of time for your prime minister but I'm shocked to see a powerful country use its power frequently, unilaterally. The United States says you do this to the world, if you don't do it we will do it - that's sad."<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu condemns Blair's Iraq stance| publisher = BBC| date = 2003-01-05|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2628607.stm|accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref> </blockquote>

In October 2004, Tutu appeared in a play at [[Off Broadway]], [[New York]] called ''[[Honor Bound to Defend Freedom|Guantanamo - Honour-bound to Defend Freedom]]''. This play was highly critical of the US handling of detainees at [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]]. Tutu played Lord Justice Steyn, a judge who questions the legal justification of the detention regime.<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu in anti-Guantanamo theatre| publisher = BBC| date = 2004-10-02| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3709288.stm |accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref>

In January 2005, Tutu added his voice to the growing dissent over terrorist suspects held at [[Camp X-Ray]] in [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]], referring to detentions without trial as "utterly unacceptable." Tutu said: <blockquote>"The rule of law is in order to ensure that those who have power don't use their power arbitrarily and every person retains their human rights until you have proven conclusively that so-and-so is in fact guilty. Whilst we are saying thank you that these have been released, what is happening to those left behind? We in South Africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable. Now if it was unacceptable then how come it can be acceptable to Britain and the United States. It is so, so deeply distressing. I am opposed to any arbitrary detention that is happening, even in Britain."<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu calls for Guantanamo release| publisher = BBC| date = 2005-01-12| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4167369.stm |accessdate = 2008-01-22}}</ref></blockquote>

In February 2006, Tutu repeated these statements after a UN report was published which called for the closure of the camp. Tutu stated that the [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]] camp was a stain on the character of the United States, while the legislation in Britain which gave a 28 day detention period for terror suspects was "excessive" and "untenable". Tutu pointed out that similar arguments were being made in Britain and the United States which the South African apartheid regime had used. "It is disgraceful and one cannot find strong enough words to condemn what Britain and the United States and some of their allies have accepted," said Tutu. Tutu also attacked Tony Blair's failed attempt to hold terrorist suspects in Britain for up to 90 days without charge. "Ninety days for a South African is an awful deja-vu because we had in South Africa in the bad old days a 90-day detention law," he said. Under apartheid, as at [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], people were held for "unconscionably long periods" and then released, he said. Tutu stated:<blockquote>
"Are you able to restore to those people the time when their freedom was denied them? If you have evidence for goodness sake produce it in a court of law. People with power have an incredible capacity for wanting to be able to retain that power and don't like scrutiny."<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu calls for Guantanamo closure| publisher = BBC| date = 2006-02-17| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4723512.stm |accessdate = 2008-01-22}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2007, Tutu stated that the global "war on terror" could not be won if people were living in desperate conditions. Tutu said that the global disparity between rich and people creates instability.
<blockquote>
"You can never win a war against terror as long as there are conditions in the world that make people desperate - poverty, disease, ignorance, et cetera. I think people are beginning to realize that you can't have pockets of prosperity in one part of the world and huge deserts of poverty and deprivation and think that you can have a stable and secure world."<ref name = povertyterror>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/09/16/talkasia.tutu/|title=Tutu: Poverty fueling terror|date= 2007-09-16| publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>
</blockquote>

===HIV/AIDS and TB===
Tutu has been a tireless campaigner for health and human rights, and has been particularly vocal in support of controlling TB and HIV.<ref name=tbhiv>{{cite news|url=http://www.tbhiv-create.org/NewsUpdates/archbishop_desmond_tutu.htm|title=Archbischop Desmond Tutu urges TB/HIV workers to continue to relieve suffering from dual scourges|publisher=Desmond Tutu HIV Centre|date=2005-09-28|accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref> In 2003 the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre was founded in [[Cape Town]], while the Desmond Tutu TB Centre was founded in 2003 at [[Stellenbosch University]]. Tutu suffered from TB in his youth and has been active in assisting those afflicted, especially as TB and HIV/Aids deaths have become intrinsicly linked in South Africa. “Those of you who work to care for people suffering from AIDS and TB are wiping a tear from God’s eye,” Archbishop Tutu said.<ref name=tbhiv/>

On [[20 April]] [[2005]], after Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected as [[Pope Benedict XVI]], Tutu said he was sad that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was unlikely to change its opposition to [[condom]]s amidst the fight against [[HIV]]/AIDS in [[Africa]]: "We would have hoped for someone more open to the more recent developments in the world, the whole question of the ministry of women and a more reasonable position with regards to condoms and HIV/AIDS."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4463873.stm|title=Africans hail conservative Pope|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2005-04-20]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>

In 2007, statistics were released that indicated HIV and AIDS numbers were lower than previously thought in South Africa. However, Tutu named these statistics "cold comfort" as it was unacceptable that 600 people died of AIDS in South Africa everyday. Tutu also rebuked the government for wasting time by discussing what caused HIV/Aids, which particularly attacks Mbeki and Health Minister [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]] for their denialist stance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Aids_Focus/0,,2-7-659_2230486,00.html|title=Aids stats 'cold comfort'- Tutu|publisher=News24|date=2007-11-30|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>

===On the Church===
In 2002, Tutu called for a reform of the [[Anglican Church]] in regard to how its leader, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is chosen. The ultimate appointment is made by the British Prime Minister and thus Tutu said that the selection process will only be properly democratic and representative when the link between church and state is broken. In 1990, Tutu was considered as Archbishop of Canterbury, however [[George Carey]] was chosen in his stead. Tutu has commented that he is "glad" that he was not chosen as once installed in [[Lambeth Palace]], he would have been homesick for South Africa, unhappy to be away from home during a critical time in the country's history.<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu calls for church reform| publisher = BBC| date = 2002-06-10| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/2036677.stm |accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref> 

In 2003 he became the patron of [[Sabeel|Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center]] located in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Desmond Tutu Detailed Biography| publisher = | date = | url = http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/pages/desmond_tutu/index.shtml |accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref> 

In February 2006 Tutu took part in the 9th Assembly of the [[World Council of Churches]], held in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]]. There he manifested his commitment to [[ecumenism]] and praised the efforts of Christian churches to promote dialogue to diminish their differences. For Desmond, "a united church is no optional extra."

====On homosexuality====
In the debate about [[Anglican views of homosexuality]] he has opposed Christian discrimination against homosexuals.  Commenting days after the [[5 August]] [[2003]] election of [[Gene Robinson]], an openly [[gay]] man to be a bishop in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], Desmond Tutu said, "In our Church here in South Africa, that doesn't make a difference. We just say that at the moment, we believe that they should remain [[celibate]] and we don't see what the fuss is about."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gay.com/headlines/4846|title=Desmond Tutu: gay bishop row is just "fuss"|publisher=Gay.com UK|date=[[2006-08-11]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>
<blockquote>
"Isn't it sad, that in a time when we face so many devastating problems – poverty, HIV/AIDS, war and conflict – that in our Communion we should be investing so much time and energy on disagreement about sexual orientation?" [The Communion, which] "used to be known for embodying the attribute of comprehensiveness, of inclusiveness, where we were meant to accommodate all and diverse views, saying we may differ in our theology but we belong together as sisters and brothers" now seems "hell-bent on excommunicating one another. God must look on and God must weep."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idCategory=33&idsub=128&id=2141 |title=Tutu calls on Anglicans to accept gay bishop |publisher=Spero News |date=[[2005-11-14]] |accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref></blockquote>
Since then Tutu has increased his criticism of conservative attitudes to homosexuality within his own church, equating [[homophobia]] with [[racism]]. Stating at a conference in Nairobi that he is "deeply disturbed that in the face of some of the most horrendous problems facing Africa, we concentrate on 'what do I do in bed with whom'".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-3528.html|title=Tutu stands up for gays|publisher=Pink News|date=2007-01-19|accessdate=}}</ref>

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on 18 November 2007, Archbishop Desmond Tutu accused the church of being obsessed with homosexuality and declared: "If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn't worship that God."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7100295.stm |title=Desmond Tutu chides Church for gay stance |publisher=BBC|date=2007-11-18|accessdate=}}</ref>

===Haiti===
In 2004, Tutu spoke against South Africa's acceptance of ousted Haitian President [[Jean-Bertrande Aristide]] for political asylum. <blockquote>
Archbishop Tutu said: "I would have hoped that he had gone anywhere but South Africa. But if it is a case of us preventing him from being killed I suppose that it is okay, but if there are charges that he should face, I think he should face those charges, if there is a guarantee that he would have safe passage and a proper trial. It's unlikely. However each of us has the capacity to become a saint, even the worst dictator."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/03_march/03/tutu.shtml|title=Archbishop Desmond Tutu warns South African Government about accepting Aristide|publisher=BBC|date=2004-03-03|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref></blockquote>

===2008 Olympics===
Tutu has been vocal in his condemnation of Chinese crackdowns on Tibetan activists. Tutu spoke at a candle-lit vigil on the eve of the [[San Francisco]] relay. Tutu does not support a full boycott of the Olympic Games, but he has called on the heads of States worldwide to not attend the Opening Ceremonies of the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cbs5.com/video/?id=32966@kpix.dayport.com|title=Raw Video: Desmont Tutu On SF Torch Relay|publisher=CBS|date=2008-04-08|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>
<blockquote>
"For God's sake, for the sake of our children, for the sake of their children, for the sake of the beautiful people of Tibet - don't go. Tell your counterparts in Beijing you wanted to come but looked at your schedule and realised you have something else to do."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7337925.stm|title=San Francisco set for torch relay|publisher=BBC|date=2008-04-09|accessdate=2008-04-09}}</ref>

== Chairman of The Elders ==
On July 18, 2007 in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Graça Machel]], and [[Desmond Tutu]] convened "[[Global Elders|The Elders]], a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, leadership and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems.  Mandela announced its formation in a speech on his 89th birthday.  Archbishop Tutu is to serve as its Chair.  Other founding members include [[Kofi Annan]], [[Ela Bhatt]], [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Li Zhaoxing]], [[Mary Robinson]], [[Muhammad Yunus]] and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], whose chair was left symbolically empty due to her confinement as a [[political prisoner]] in [[Burma]].

“This group can speak freely and boldly, working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken,” Mandela commented.  “Together we will work to support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair.”

The Elders will be independently funded by a group of Founders, including [[Richard Branson]], [[Peter Gabriel]], Ray Chambers, [[Michael Chambers]], Bridgeway Foundation, Pam [[Omidyar]], Humanity United, [[Amy Robbins]], [[Shashi Ruia]], Dick Tarlow and the [[United Nations Foundation]].

The Elders' first mission was to travel to [[Sudan]] in September-October 2007 to foster peace in the [[Darfur crisis]]. "Our hope is that we can keep Darfur in the spotlight and spur on governments to help keep peace in the region," said Tutu.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/0,,2-11_2236256,00.html |title=Tutu denounces rights abuses|date= 2007-12-10|publisher=News24|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>

==Criticism of Tutu==
{{Expand|date=February 2007}}
=== Nelson Mandela Foundation Lecture ===
After a decade of freedom for [[South Africa]], Archbishop Tutu was honored with the invitation to deliver the annual Nelson Mandela Foundation Lecture. On [[November 23]], [[2004]] Tutu was given the address entitled, "Look to the Rock from Which You Were Hewn'.  This lecture, critical of the [[African National Congress|ANC]]-controlled government, stirred a pot of controversy between Tutu and [[Thabo Mbeki]], calling into question "the right to criticise."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?3,28,10,1763|title=Controversy: Tutu, Mbeki & the freedom to criticise|date= 2005|author=Tutu, Mbeki & others |publisher=Centre for Civil Society |accessdate=}}</ref> He made a stinging attack against South Africa's political elite, saying the country was "sitting on a powder keg"<ref name=keg>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4035809.stm |title=Tutu warns of poverty 'powder keg'|date= 2004-11-23 |publisher=BBC|accessdate=}}</ref> because of its failure to alleviate poverty a decade after apartheid's end. Tutu also said that attempts to boost black economic ownership were only benefiting an elite minority, while political "kowtowing" within the ruling ANC was hampering democracy.<blockquote>
"What is black empowerment when it seems to benefit not the vast majority but an elite that tends to be recycled?"<ref name=keg/>
</blockquote> 
The archbishop criticised politicians for debating whether to give the poor an income grant of $16 (£12) a month and said the idea should be seriously considered. Tutu has often spoken in support of the Basic Income Grant (BIG) which has so far been defeated in parliament. After the first round of volleys were fired, [[South African Press Association]] [[journalist]], [[Ben Maclennan]] reported Tutu's response as: 
<blockquote>
"Thank you Mr President for telling me what you think of me, that I am--a liar with scant regard for the truth, and a charlatan posing with his concern for the poor, the hungry, the oppressed and the voiceless." --Tutu.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.armsdeal-vpo.co.za/quotes.html|title=Quotes of the Week|author=Maclennan, Ben|date= 2004-12-02|publisher=Sapa|accessdate=}}</ref>
</blockquote>

=== Tutu's relationship with ANC===
Tutu warned of corruption shortly after the reelection of the [[African National Congress]] government of South Africa, saying that they "stopped the gravy train just long enough to get on themselves."<ref>WGBH, date unknown. [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mandela/interviews/tutu.html Interview with Tutu] by John Carlin, for PBS Frontline.  Retrieved on [[7 September]] [[2006]].</ref> In August 2006 Archbishop Tutu publicly urged [[Jacob Zuma]], the South African politician who had been accused of sexual crimes and corruption, to drop out of the ANC's presidential succession race. He said in a public lecture that he would not be able to hold his "head high" if Zuma became leader after being accused both of rape and corruption. In September 2006, Tutu repeated his opposition to Zuma's candidacy as ANC leader due to Zuma's "moral failings"<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5384310.stm S Africa is losing its way - Tutu, BBC, 27 September 2006]</ref>

The head of the Congress of South African Students condemned Tutu as a "loose cannon" and a "scandalous man" - a reaction which prompted an angry Mbeki to side with Tutu.  Zuma's personal advisor responded by accusing Tutu of having double standards and "selective amnesia" (as well as being old). Elias Khumalo claims the archbishop "had found it so easy to accept the apology from the apartheid government that committed unspeakable atrocities against millions of South Africans", yet now "cannot find it in his heart to accept the apology from this humble man who has erred". Tutu and Zuma’s public criticism of each other are reflections of a turbulent time in South African politics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=282735&area=/insight/insight__national/|title=Zuma camp lashes out at 'old' Tutu|publisher+[[Mail & Guardian]]|date=[[2006-09-01]]|accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref>

==Quotes by Tutu==
[[Image:Desmond Tutu Quilt.jpg|thumb|left|This quilt by Hollis Chatelain features Tutu surrounded by children.]]

* "When the missionaries came to Africa they had the Bible and we had the land. They said, 'Let us pray.' We closed our eyes. When we opened them we had the Bible and they had the land."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativequotations.com/one/1455.htm|title=Sayings of the Week|date=1984-12-16| publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref>
* "My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they turned their backs on their profound and  chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality."
* "Good is stronger than evil; love is stronger than hate; light is stronger than darkness; life is stronger than death. Victory is ours, through him who loves us."
* "If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn’t worship that God."
* "A person is a person because he recognizes others as persons."
* "Be nice to whites, they need you to rediscover their humanity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativequotations.com/one/1455.htm|title=Sayings of the Week|date=1984-10-19| publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref>

* "Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world."

* "I am fifty-two years of age. I am a bishop in the Anglican Church, and a few people might be constrained to say that I was reasonably responsible. In the land of my birth I cannot vote, whereas a young person of eighteen can vote. And why? Because he or she possesses that wonderful biological attribute -- a white skin."
* "My humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together."
* "[[Niger]] is not an isolated island of desperation. It lies within a sea of problems across Africa - particularly the 'forgotten emergencies' in poor countries or regions with little strategic or material appeal."
* "Those who invest in South Africa should not think they are doing us a favor; they are here for what they get out of our cheap and abundant labor, and they should know that they are buttressing one of the most vicious systems."
* "We may be surprised at the people we find in heaven. God has a soft spot for sinners. His standards are quite low."
* "We would like to see you departing peacefully."
* "What is black empowerment when it seems to benefit not the vast majority but an elite that tends to be recycled?"
* "When a pile of cups is tottering on the edge of the table and you warn that they will crash to the ground, in South Africa you are blamed when that happens."
