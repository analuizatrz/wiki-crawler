A '''tsunami''' ({{pronEng|tsuːˈnɑːmi}}) is a series of [[Ocean surface wave|waves]] created when a body of water, such as an [[ocean]], is rapidly displaced. [[Earthquake]]s, [[mass movement]]s above or below water, some [[volcanic eruption]]s and other [[underwater explosion]]s, [[landslides]], underwater [[earthquake]]s, large [[impact event| asteroid impacts]] and testing with [[nuclear weapon]]s at sea all have the potential to generate a tsunami. The effects of a tsunami are always devastating due to the immense volumes of water and energy involved. Since [[meteors|meteorites]] are small, they will not generate a tsunami.

The term tsunami comes from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] meaning literally ''(tsu)harbor (nami)wave''. 

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Thucydides]] was the first to relate tsunamis to submarine quakes,<ref name="Thucydides 3.89.1-4"/> <ref name="Smid, T. C. 103f."/> but understanding of the nature of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and is the subject of ongoing research.

Many early geological, geographic, oceanographic etc; texts refer to "''Seismic sea waves''" - these are now referred to as "tsunami."

== Terminology ==
The term tsunami comes from the  meaning ''[[harbor]]'' ("tsu", [[wikt:津|津]]) and ''[[Ocean surface wave|wave]]'' ("nami", [[wikt:波|波]]).  [a. Jap. tsunami, tunami, f. tsu harbour + nami waves. - Oxford English Dictionary].  For the plural, one can either follow ordinary English practice and add an ''s'', or use an invariable plural as in Japanese. Tsunamis are common throughout [[Japanese history]]; approximately 195 events in Japan have been recorded.

A tsunami has a much smaller [[amplitude]] (wave height) offshore, and a very long [[wavelength]] (often hundreds of kilometers long), which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a slight swell usually about 300 mm above the normal sea surface. A tsunami can occur at any state of the tide and even at low tide will still inundate coastal areas if the incoming waves surge high enough. 

Tsunamis are often referred to by the media as ''[[tidal waves]].'' This term is inaccurate because tsunamis are not related to tides and its use is discouraged by [[geologist]]s and [[oceanographer]]s.

== Causes ==
A tsunami can be generated when converging or destructive [[plate boundaries]] abruptly move and vertically displace the overlying water. Such large vertical movements of the Earth's crust can occur at destructive [[plate boundaries]]. It is very unlikely that they can form at divergent (constructive) or conservative plate boundaries. This is because constructive or conservative boundaries do not generally disturb the vertical displacement of the water column. [[Subduction]] zone related earthquakes generate the majority of all tsunamis. 

On 1st April, 1946 a Magnitude 7.8 ([[Richter Scale]]) [[earthquake]] occurred near the [[Aleutian Islands]], [[Alaska]]. It generated a tsunami which inundated Hilo on the island of Hawai'i with a 14 m high surge.  The area where the [[earthquake]] occurred is where the [[Pacific Ocean]] floor is [[subducting]] (or being pushed downwards) under [[Alaska]].

Examples of tsunami being generated at locations away from convergent boundaries include - [[Storegga]] during the [[Neolithic]] era, [[Grand Banks]] 1929, [[Papua New Guinea]] 1998 (Tappin, 2001). In the case of the Grand Banks and Papua New Guinea tsunamis an earthquake caused sediments to become unstable and subsequently fail. These slumped and as they flowed down slope a tsunami was generated. These tsunami did not travel transoceanic distances. 

It is not known what caused the Storegga sediments to fail. It may have been due to overloading of the sediments causing them to become unstable and they then failed solely as a result of being overloaded. It is also possible that an earthquake caused the sediments to become unstable and then fail. Another theory is that a release of gas hydrates (methane etc.,) caused the slump.   

Tsunamis may be generated when an earthquake occurs causing the floor of the ocean to vertically displace the water column - one part "rises" whilst the other part "sinks". This occurs in seconds and huge volumes of sea water have incredibly large levels of energy transferred into them. This energy radiates outwards in a series of low frequency and therefore long wavelength waves which generally have an amplitude of about 300 mm above the normal swell of the ocean and are rarely observed as a result. It should be noted that the displacement forms a trough and a peak as it moves away from the zone of activation and will usually come ashore in the same manner. The trough causes "drawback" whilst the peak arrives as a sudden surge.

The "[[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Great Chilean earthquake]]" (19:11 hrs UTC) 22nd May 1960 (9.5 Mw), the 27th March 1964 "[[Good Friday Earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]]" Alaska 1964 (9.2 Mw), and the "[[2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake|Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake]]" (00:58:53 UTC) 26th December 2004 (9.2 Mw), are recent examples of powerful [[megathrust]] earthquakes that generated a tsunami that was able to cross oceans. Smaller (4.2 Mw) earthquakes in Japan can trigger tsunami that can devastate nearby coasts within 15 minutes or less.  
 
In the 1950s it was hypothesised that larger tsunamis than had previously been believed possible may be caused by [[landslides]], explosive volcanic action e.g., [[Santorini]], [[Krakatau]], and [[impact event]]s when they contact water. These phenomena rapidly displace large volumes of water, as energy from falling debris or expansion is transferred to the water into which the debris falls at a rate faster than the ocean water can absorb it. They have been named by the media as "[[mega-tsunami]]." 

Tsunami caused by these mechanisms, unlike the trans-oceanic tsunami caused by some earthquakes, may dissipate quickly and rarely affect coastlines distant from the source due to the small area of sea affected. These events can give rise to much larger local [[shock wave]]s ([[solitons]]), such as the landslide at the head of [[Lituya Bay]] 1958, which produced a wave with an initial surge estimated at 524m. However, an extremely large gravitational landslide might generate a so called "[[mega-tsunami]]" that may have the ability to travel trans-oceanic distances. This though is strongly debated and there is no actual geological evidence to support this hypothesis.

== Signs of an approaching tsunami ==
[[Image:The monument to the victims of tsunami.jpg|thumb|250px|The monument to the victims of tsunami at Laupahoehoe, [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].]]
There is often no advance warning of an approaching tsunami. However, since earthquakes are often a cause of tsunami, any earthquake occurring near a body of water may generate a tsunami if it occurs at shallow depth, is of moderate or high magnitude, and the water volume and depth is sufficient. In Japan moderate - 4.2 Magnitude earthquakes can generate tsunami which can inundate the area within 15 minutes.

If the first part of a tsunami to reach land is a trough (draw back) rather than a crest of the wave, the water along the shoreline may recede dramatically, exposing areas that are normally always submerged. This can serve as an advance warning of the approaching tsunami which will rush in faster than it is possible to run. If a person is in a coastal area where the sea suddenly draws back (many survivors report an accompanying sucking sound), their only real chance of survival is to run for high ground or seek the high floors of high rise buildings. 

In the [[2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake|2004 tsunami]] that occurred in the Indian Ocean drawback was not reported on the African coast or any other western coasts it inundated, when the tsunami approached from the east. This was because of the nature of the wave - it moved downwards on the eastern side of the fault line and upwards on the western side. It was the western pulse that inundated coastal areas of Africa and other western areas.

80% of all tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean, but are possible wherever large bodies of water are found, including inland lakes. They may be caused by landslides, volcanic explosions, bolides and seismic activity.

'''Indian Ocean Tsunami''' According to an article in "Geographical" magazine (April 2008), the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26th December 2004 was not the worst that the region could expect. Professor Costas Synolakis of the Tsunami Research Center at the University of Southern California co-authored a paper in "Geophysical Journal International" which suggests that a future tsunami in the Indian Ocean basin could affect locations such as Madagascar, Singapore, Somalia, Western Australia and many others. The Boxing Day tsunami killed over 300,000 people with many bodies either being lost to the sea or unidentified. Some unofficial estimates have claimed that approximately 1 million people may have died directly or indirectly solely as a result of the tsunami.

== Warnings and prevention ==

A tsunami cannot be prevented or precisely predicted - even if the right magnitude of an earthquake occurs in the right location. Geologists, Oceanographers and Seismologist analyse each earthquake and based upon many factors may or may not issue a tsunami warning. However, there are some warning signs of an impending tsunami, and there are many systems being developed and in use to reduce the damage from tsunami. One of the most important systems that is used and constantly monitored are bottom pressure sensors. These are anchored and attached to buoys. Sensors on the equipment constantly monitor the pressure of the overlying water column - this can be deduced by the simple calculation of:

F = Gdh 

where F = the overlying force or pressure in Newtons per metre square, G is the acceleration due to gravity, d = the density of the water and h = the height of the water column.

G = 9.8 m s<sup>2</sup>, d = 1.1 x 10<sup>3</sup> kg m<sup>3</sup> and h is the depth of water in metres

Hence for a water column of 5,000 m depth the overlying pressure is equal to 9.8 x 1.1 x 10<sup>3</sup> x 5 x 10<sup>3</sup> or about 5.4 x 10 7 N m<sup>2</sup> or about 5.7 Million tonnes per metre square.

In instances where the leading edge of the tsunami wave is the trough, the sea will recede from the coast half of the wave's period before the wave's arrival. If the slope of the coastal seabed is shallow, this recession can exceed many hundreds of meters. People unaware of the danger may remain at or near the shore out of curiosity, or for collecting fish from the exposed seabed. During the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26th December 2004, the sea withdrew and many people then went onto the exposed sea bed to investigate. Pictures taken show people on the normally submerged areas with the advancing wave in the background. Most people who were on the beach were unable to escape to high ground and died.

In the [[Muromachi period]], a tsunami struck Kamakura, destroying the wooden building that housed the colossal statue of [[Amitabha|Amida]] [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]] at [[Kotokuin]]. Since that time, the statue has been outdoors.]]

Regions with a high risk of tsunami may use [[tsunami warning system]]s to detect tsunami and warn the general population before the wave reaches land. On the west coast of the United States, which is prone to Pacific Ocean tsunami, warning signs advise people of evacuation routes. 

The Pacific Tsunami Warning System is based in Honolulu. It monitors all sesimic activity that occurs anywhere within the Pacific. Based up the magnitude and other information a tsunami warning may be issued. It is important to note that the subduction zones around the Pacific are seismically active, but not all earthquakes generate tsunami and for this reason computers are used as a tool to assist in analysing the risk of tsunami generation of each and every earthquake that occurs in the Pacific Ocean and the adjoining land masses.

As a direct result of the Indian Ocean tsunami, a re-appraisal of the tsunami threat of all coastal areas is being undertaken by national governments and the United Nations Disaster Mitigation Committee. A tsunami warning system is currently being installed in the Indian Ocean.

[[Computer model]]s can predict tsunami arrival - observations have shown that predicted arrival times are usually within minutes of the predicted time. Bottom pressure sensors are able to relay information in real time and based upon the readings and other information about the seismic event that triggered it and the shape of the seafloor ([[bathymetry]]) and coastal land ([[topography]]), it is possible to estimate the amplitude and therefore the surge height, of the approaching tsunami. All the countries that border the Pacific Ocean collaborate in the Tsunami Warning System and most regularly practice evacuation and other procedures to prepare people for the inevitable tsunami. In Japan such preparation is a mandatory requirement of government, local authorities, emergency services and the population. 

Some zoologists hypothesise that animals may have an ability to sense subsonic [[Rayleigh waves]] from an earthquake or a tsunami. Some animals seem to have the ability to detect natural phenomena and if correct, careful observation and monitoring could possibly provide advance warning of earthquakes, tsunami etc. However, the evidence is controversial and has not been proven scientifically. There are some unsubstantiated claims that animals before the Lisbon quake were restless and moved away from low lying areas to higher ground. Yet many other animals in the same areas drowned. The phenomenon was also noted in [[Sri Lanka]] in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. The following two references whilst revelant, are media and not scientific - (BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4381395.stm]) (Kenneally, [http://www.slate.com/id/2111608]). It is possible that certain animals (e.g., elephants) may have heard the sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast. The elephants reaction was to move away from the approaching noise - inland.  Some humans, on the other hand, went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result.

It is not possible to prevent a tsunami. However, in some tsunami-prone countries some measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused on shore. Japan has implemented an extensive programme of building [[tsunami wall]]s of up to 4.5 m (13.5 ft) high in front of populated coastal areas. Other localities have built floodgates and channels to redirect the water from incoming tsunami. However, their effectiveness has been questioned, as tsunami often surge higher than the barriers. For instance, the [[Historic tsunami#1993 - Okushiri, Hokkaido tsunami (北海道南西沖地震)|Okushiri, Hokkaidō tsunami]] which struck [[Okushiri, Hokkaidō|Okushiri Island]] of [[Hokkaidō]] within two to five minutes of the earthquake on [[July 12]], [[1993]] created waves as much as 30 m (100 ft) tall - as high as a 10-story building. The port town of [[Aonae]] was completely surrounded by a tsunami wall, but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area. The wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of the tsunami, but it did not prevent major destruction and loss of life. (This reference is Japanese - [http://library.skr.jp/19930712_nanseioki.htm])

The effects of a tsunami may be mitigated by natural factors such as tree cover on the shoreline. Some locations in the path of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami escaped almost unscathed as a result of the tsunami's energy being absorbed by trees such as [[coconut palm]]s and [[mangrove]]s. In one striking example, the village of [[Naluvedapathy]] in India's [[Tamil Nadu]] region suffered minimal damage and few deaths as the wave broke up on a forest of 80,244 trees planted along the shoreline in 2002 in a bid to enter the [[Guinness Book of Records]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4269847.stm] Environmentalists have suggested tree planting along stretches of seacoast which are prone to tsunami risks. It would take some years for the trees to grow to a useful size, but such plantations could offer a much cheaper and longer-lasting means of tsunami mitigation than the construction of artificial barriers.

==Tsunami in History==
{{main article|Historic tsunami}}
Historically speaking, tsunami are not rare, with at least 25 tsunami occurring in the last century. Of these, many were recorded in the [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] region - particularly [[Japan]]. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Boxing Day Tsunami]] in 2004 caused approx. 350,000 deaths and many more injuries. 

[[426 BC Maliakos Gulf tsunami|As early as 426 B.C.]] the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Thucydides]] inquired in his book ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' about the causes of tsunami, and argued rightly that it could only be explained as a consequence of ocean earthquakes.<ref name="Thucydides 3.89.1-4">[[Thucydides]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Thuc.+3.89.1 “A History of the Peloponnesian War”, 3.89.1-4]</ref> He was thus the first in the history of [[natural science]] to correlate quakes and waves in terms of cause and effect:<ref name="Smid, T. C. 103f.">Smid, T. C.: "'Tsunamis' in Greek Literature", ''Greece & Rome'', 2nd Ser., Vol. 17, No. 1 (Apr., 1970), pp. 100-104 (103f.)</ref>

<blockquote>The cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be sought in the earthquake. At the point where its shock has been the most violent the sea is driven back, and suddenly recoiling with redoubled force, causes the inundation. Without an earthquake I do not see how such an accident could happen.<ref name="Thucydides 3.89.5">[[Thucydides]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Thuc.+3.89.1 “A History of the Peloponnesian War”, 3.89.5]</ref></blockquote> 

The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (''Res Gestae'' 26.10.15-19) describes the typical sequence of a tsunami including an incipient earthquake, the sudden retreat of the sea and a following gigantic wave on the occasion of the [[365 Crete earthquake|365 A.D. tsunami]] devastating [[Alexandria]].<ref name="Kelly, Gavin (2004)">Kelly, Gavin (2004), “Ammianus and the Great Tsunami”, ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 94, pp. 141-167 (141)</ref> <ref name="Stanley, Jean-Daniel & Jorstad, Thomas F. (2005)">Stanley, Jean-Daniel & Jorstad, Thomas F. (2005), "[http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2005AM/finalprogram/abstract_96386.htm The 365 A.D. Tsunami Destruction of Alexandria, Egypt: Erosion, Deformation of Strata and Introduction of Allochthonous Material]"</ref>


'''Tsunami and the bible''' Some recent work by scholars (Egyptologists, Israeli and others), geologists and oceanographers (including Dr Iain Stewart of University of Plymouth, UK), indicates that the [[Minoan eruption|Santorini eruption]] (about 1615 BC) may have caused the devastation of the Egyptian armies that is mentioned in the [[Exodus]]. The Exodus is dated as occurring between 1290 and 1340 BC. It is unlikely that the details were recorded in the immediate aftermath and there was probably a delay in the writing of the account. Whilst there is a discrepancy of about 300 years, given the circumstances surrounding the dating of the Santorini eruption it is possible that the two events did coincide. Further support for this is that the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean was marshland prior to the construction of the Suez Canal and was a known source of reeds. Is the "Red Sea" a wrong interpretation of the "Reed Sea," and did the Santorini or Minoan eruption coincide with the Exodus? There is ongoing research into this including drilling boreholes to look for tsunamite - the deposit left by tsunamis and other evidence to support or disprove this theory.
