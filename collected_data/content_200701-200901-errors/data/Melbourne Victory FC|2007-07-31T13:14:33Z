'''Melbourne Victory Football Club''' is an [[Australia]]n professional [[football (soccer)]] club based in the city of [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The club competes in the [[A-League]], and are currently the only team from the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] playing in the competition.

Melbourne Victory is the [[A-League 2006-07|2006-07 A-League]] [[List of A-League champions|premiership]] and [[List of A-League champions|championship]] winner - the first and only club in the [[A-League]] to achieve the championship/premiership double[http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/amazing-archies-victory-march/2007/02/18/1171733611976.html]. As a result, the club will be one of two Australian representatives to the [[AFC Champions League 2008|2008]] [[AFC Champions League]].

==History==
Melbourne Victory were founded in [[2004]] after the announcement of a revamped domestic league in Australia.  The new [[A-League]] replaced the [[National Soccer League]], which was disbanded in 2004. Eight licences were handed out by [[Football Federation Australia]]. 

The [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] approved the Melbourne Victory consortium as Melbourne's representative in the league, with [[Belgravia Leisure Pty Ltd]] backing the club. The Chairman and CEO of Belgravia Leisure, [[Geoff Lord]], was installed as the inaugural Chairman of Melbourne Victory F.C. 

[[Gary Cole (footballer)|Gary Cole]] (an ex-[[Australia national football (soccer) team|Socceroo]]) was hired to become Football Operations manager, and was soon joined by [[Ernie Merrick]], appointed as head coach from the [[Victorian Institute of Sport]] (VIS). [[Archie Thompson]], a current Socceroo who had been playing in [[Belgium]] with [[Lierse S.K.]], was the club's first player signing. The club soon signed three more internationals for the innagural squad - Socceroo [[Kevin Muscat]], [[Austria]]n [[Richard Kitzbichler]] and [[Belgian]] [[Geoffrey Claeys]].

The remainder of the squad was quickly assembled, although room was left for signings before Melbourne played its first competitive match against [[Adelaide United]] in a [[World Club Championship]] qualifier.

On [[October 27]] [[2005]], [[South Korean]] electronics giant [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] became the club's major sponsor in a two year deal.

Melbourne Victory were the first team to complete the [[A-League]] double in the history of the competition; clinching the premiership against the [[New Zealand Knights]] 4-0 at Olympic Park with 4 rounds of competition remaining, then beating [[Adelaide United]] 6-0 in the grand final at a sold out [[Telstra Dome]] to take the championship.

==Colours and badge==
Melbourne Victorys kit colours are navy blue, silver and white, which encompass the traditional state sporting colours of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In the first [[A-League]] season, only the club badge displayed a [[Chevron (insigne)|chevron]], known colloquially as the "Big V", a symbol that has long been identied with Victorian sporting teams. However, in the 2006-07 season the away strip was changed to a grey jersey with a white chevron on the front. This was an immediate hit with the club's supporters and fans, and from the 2007-08 season onwards the Victory's home jersey will sport a white chevron on the front.

==Stadium==
[[Image:Aleaguefinal3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|2006-07 A-League Grand Final at Telstra Dome]]
{{see|Telstra Dome|Olympic Park Stadium|Melbourne Rectangular Stadium}}

Melbourne Victory were originally based at the aging [[Olympic Park Stadium|Olympic Park]] stadium, where they played all home matches during the [[A-League 2005-06|2005-06 A-League season]].  This stadium has seated areas only on the wings, with standing-room sandy terraces on the north and south ends.

On the back of a then-record regular season attendance of 39,730 at the all-seater [[Telstra Dome]] for the match against [[Sydney FC]] on [[September 2]] [[2006]], it was announced that seven home matches would be moved to "the Dome". Only one match (due to a Robbie Williams concert)- against the struggling [[New Zealand Knights]] - would remain at [[Olympic Park]].

This move to such a large stadium was viewed with skepticism by many, but proved to be an outstanding success, with the average attendance rising to over 27,000 during the season. 

Prior to the 06-07 season the club had planned to move to a new stadium being planned to the east of the current Olympic Park complex.  The new [[Melbourne Rectangular Stadium]] was originally expected to seat approximately 20,000 spectators (expandable to 25,000) and was to be completed in time for the start of the 2008-09 campaign. 

These plans have since been revised after the Victory refused to commit to playing at such a small capacity stadium.  On [[May 23]] [[2007]], the club announced it had signed as a founding co-tenant of the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, which would now be built to accommodate a minimum of 31,000 spectators.

Telstra Dome will continue to serve as the club's home ground until the completion of the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium. The club will split its home games between the new stadium and the Telstra Dome from the 2009-10 A-League campaign.

== Supporters ==
Melbourne Victory is the only A-League team based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and have a dedicated fan base - the club have consistently set records for A-League attendances. With the move to Telstra Dome during the 2006/07 season, large crowds have been a feature of Victory home games.  On [[February 18]], [[2007]], a capacity crowd of 55,436 attended the Grand Final against [[Adelaide United]] at the Telstra Dome.  This is the largest attendance on record for a domestic football match in Australia, surpassing the previous record of 50,333 set at the same venue earlier in the season in a match against [[Sydney F.C.]], recorded as the current record Australian Domestic regular season attendance. Melbourne are known to take the largest numbers of away fans when travelling in the league, with many fans undeterred by travelling several thousand kilometres to places like [[Brisbane]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].

Melbourne Victory has a number of supporter groups, each group with its own style of support. These biggest and most notable group is the ''BWB'' (Blue and White Brigade) who locate in the northern terrace, ''M7C'' (May 7 Crew), ''SDC'' (Southern Death Crew) and a small number of fans associated with Melbourne Victory's inaugural supporters group UNION.  The British style of support generally stand at the North End of Telstra Dome, however it's referred to as the 'South End' because of the tradition started by the SDC and affiliates at the South-End terrace of [[Olympic Park]]. The South-End of Telstra Dome hosts the more European / South American style of support led by the ''BWB'', however they are branded the 'Northern Terrace' as a whole, again because of ties to the club's original stadium. Victory supporters are also famous for singing the riff to [[Seven Nation Army]] by [[The White Stripes]] as a celebration to a goal.
