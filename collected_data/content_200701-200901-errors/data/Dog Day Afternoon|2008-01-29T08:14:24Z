'''''Dog Day Afternoon''''' is a [[1975 in film|1975 film]] directed by [[Sidney Lumet]] and written by [[Frank Pierson]]. The film stars [[Al Pacino]], [[John Cazale]], [[Chris Sarandon]], [[James Broderick]], and [[Charles Durning]]. Based on the events of a [[bank robbery]] that took place on August 22, 1972, ''Dog Day Afternoon'' tells the story of Sonny Wortzik, who with his partner Salvatore Naturile, holds hostage the employees of a [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]<ref>[http://www.baltimorestyle.com/nov05issue/newyork-nov05.html Charm City North] for Baltimore Style by Mark J.

This film was inspired by P.F. Kluge's article "The Boys in the Bank", which tells a similar story of the robbery of a Brooklyn bank by [[John Wojtowicz]] and Salvatore Naturile.  This article was  published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in 1972.<ref name="life">"The Boys in the Bank" by P.F. Kluge and Thomas Moore for ''Life'', [[September 22]] [[1972]], Vol. 73(12).</ref> The film received generally positive reviews, some of which referred to its [[anti-establishment]] tone. ''Dog Day Afternoon'' was nominated for several [[Academy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] awards, and won one  [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. 

==Plot==

First-time crook Sonny Wortzik and his friend Sal rob a Brooklyn bank to fund Sonny's boyfriend's sex change operation, only to discover that the bank has no money. Unsure what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage. The police are alerted that there is a robbery in progress. Detective Moretti and numerous officers set up a siege around the bank. When Moretti calls the bank to tell the lead robber, Sonny, that the police have arrived, Sonny warns that he and his armed accomplice, Sal, have hostages and will kill them if anyone tries to come into the bank. Detective Moretti acts as [[Hostage crisis|hostage negotiator]], while [[FBI]] Agent Sheldon monitors his actions. Howard, the security guard, has an [[asthma]] attack, so Sonny releases him when Moretti asks for a hostage as a sign of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside the bank to see how aggressive the police forces are. After a moment, Sonny starts his now-famous [[Dog Day Afternoon#References in popular culture|"ATTICA!" chant]], and the civilian crowd starts cheering for Sonny.

[[Image:DogDayAfternoonPacino01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pacino as Wortzik, standing at the bank's door talking with police]]
After realizing they cannot make a simple getaway, Sonny demands transportation: a jet to take them out of the country. When a tactical team approaches the back door, he fires a shot to warn them off. Moretti tries to persuade Sonny that those police were a separate unit that he was not controlling. Later, Sonny incites the crowd by throwing money over the police barricades. Some overrun the barricade and a few are arrested. When Sonny's wife Leon Schermer (a [[transwoman]]) arrives, she reveals that Sonny is robbing the bank to pay for Leon's [[sex reassignment surgery]] and that Sonny also has a legal wife, Angie, and children.  Leon refuses to speak with Sonny, even over the telephone.

As night sets in, the lights in the bank all shut off.  Sonny goes outside again and discovers that Agent Sheldon has taken command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when hostage Mulvaney goes into a diabetic shock, Agent Sheldon lets a doctor through. While the doctor is inside the bank, Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone. The two have a lengthy conversation that reveals Leon had [[Parasuicide|attempted suicide]] to "get away from" Sonny.  She had been hospitalized at the [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric ward]] of [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] until the police brought her to the scene. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal, to wherever they take the plane. Sonny tells police listening to the phone call that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery attempt.

[[Image:Dogdayafternoon salmulvaney.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sal ''(right)'' guards Mulvaney.]]
After the phone call, the doctor asks Sonny to let Mulvaney leave and Sonny agrees.  Mulvaney refuses, instead insisting he remain with his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank again.  They have brought his mother to the scene. She unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give himself up and Agent Sheldon signals that a limousine will arrive in ten minutes to take them to a waiting jet. Once back inside the bank, Sonny writes out his [[Will (law)|will]], leaving money from his [[Insurance|life insurance]] to Leon for her sex change and to his wife Angie. 

When the limousine arrives, Sonny checks it for any hidden weapons or [[booby trap]]s. When he decides the car is satisfactory, he settles on Agent Murphy to drive Sal, the remaining hostages and him to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy Airport]]. Sonny sits in the front next to Murphy while Sal sits behind them. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so Sal won't accidentally shoot him. As they wait on the airport [[tarmac]] for the plane to [[Taxiing|taxi]] into position, Agent Sheldon forces Sonny's weapon onto the dashboard, creating a distraction which allows Murphy to pull a [[pistol]] hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested and the hostages are all escorted to the [[Airport terminal|terminal]]. The film ends with Sonny watching Sal's body being taken from the car on a [[stretcher]].

==Historical event==
[[Image:LFChaseP1975.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The location of the actual event, 450 Avenue P, Brooklyn NY (1975 photo)]]
The movie was based on the story of [[John Wojtowicz]] and adheres to the basic facts of what  happened, according to the ''Life'' article "The Boys in the Bank". With Sal Naturile, Wojtowicz held up a [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] branch in Brooklyn, New York on [[August 22]] [[1972]].<ref name="trivia1"/><ref name="life"/> 

Many details from the actual robbery are depicted in the film, such as the arrival of [[Ernest Aron]] (Leon Schermer in the film) at the scene and her refusal to meet with Wojtowicz, the robbers demanding pizza (although in the actual event it was delivered by FBI agents, not a delivery boy),<ref name="dailynews1">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dailynews082472.2.jpg To Crooks, It's All Pies in Sky] for ''[[New York Daily News]]'' by Ellen Fleysher on [[August 24]] [[1972]]. Retrieved [[May 3]] [[2006]].</ref> and the gun that was hidden in the getaway car used to shoot Naturile.<ref name="life"/> The robbery and resulting hostage situation took 14 hours from beginning to end;<ref name="trivia1"/> in the film it appears to take about the same time.

After being apprehended, Wojtowicz was convicted in court and sentenced to twenty years in prison, of which he served fourteen. <ref>{{cite web

Wojtowicz wrote a letter to the [[New York Times]] in 1975 out of concern that people would believe the version of the events portrayed in the film, which he said was "only 30% true". Some of Wojtowicz's objections included the portrayal of his wife Carmen Bifulco, the conversation with his mother that Wojtowicz claimed never happened, and the refusal of police to let him speak to his wife Carmen (unlike what was portrayed in the film). He did, however, praise Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon's portrayals of him and his wife Ernest Aron as accurate.<ref>[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC15folder/RealDogDay.html Real ''Dog Day'' hero tells his story] by John Wojtowicz from Jump Cut, no. 15, 1977, pp. 31–32. Retrieved [[March 13]], [[2007]]</ref>

The film shows Sonny making out a [[Will (law)|will]] to give Leon his life insurance.  Even if Sonny should be killed, Leon might still be able to pay for the operation. The real-life Wojtowicz was paid $7,500 plus 1% of the film's net profits for the rights to his story, $2,500 of which he gave to Ernest Aron to pay for her sexual reassignment surgery.<ref name="trivia1"/> Aron became [[Elizabeth Eden|Elizabeth Debbie Eden]]<ref name="eden">[http://www.gaycenter.org/resources/archive/collection/006 Liz Eden Papers] for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Center 1973–1986 (Bulk 1974).

==Production==

The original inspiration for the film was an article written by [[P. F. Kluge]] and Thomas Moore for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in September 1972. The article included many of the details later used in the film and noted the relationship which Wojtowicz and Naturile developed with hostages and the police. Bank manager Robert Barrett said, "I'm supposed to hate you guys [Wojtowicz/Naturile], but I've had more laughs tonight than I've had in weeks. We had a kind of camaraderie." Teller Shirley Bell said,"[I]f they had been my houseguests on a Saturday night, it would have been hilarious."<ref name="life"/>  The novelization of the film was penned by organized crime writer, [[Leslie Waller]].

The film has no [[musical score]] other than the [[Elton John]] song "[[Amoreena]]" (which first appeared on John's 1970 album ''[[Tumbleweed Connection]]'') in the opening credits. Although many scenes within the bank establish that it was quite hot during the robbery, some outdoor sequences were shot in weather so cold that actors had to put ice in their mouths to stop their breath from showing on camera.<ref name="trivia1"/> Exterior shots were filmed on location on [[Prospect Park West (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park West]] between 17th and 18th Street in [[Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn|Windsor Terrace]] of Brooklyn.  The interior shots of the bank were filmed in a set created in a warehouse.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/about/ny-ihiny060805story,0,7582518.htmlstory?coll=4thrail-bottom-promo ''Dog Day Afternoon'' "It Happened in New York"] for Newsday by Cynthia Blair.

''Dog Day Afternoon'', released in 1975, is based on events that took place in 1972. During this era of heavy [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam war]], "anti-establishment" Sonny repeatedly reminds people he is a Vietnam [[veteran]] and repeats the counter-cultural war cry of "Attica!" <ref>[http://www.cornwallmoviemagic.co.uk/fm_12.htm 10 Best Heist Movies Ever] for Movie Magic. Retrieved [[April 28]] [[2006]].</ref> in references the [[Attica Prison riots]].

===Critical reactions===
Upon its release, ''Dog Day Afternoon'' received generally favorable reviews. [[Vincent Canby]] called it "Sidney Lumet's most accurate, most flamboyant New York movie" and praised the "brilliant characterizations" by the entire cast.<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=&title2=Dog%20Day%20Afternoon%20%28Movie%29&reviewer=VINCENT%20CANBY&v_id=14193 Screen: Lumet's ''Dog Day Afternoon''] by Vincent Camby for The New York Times on [[September 22]] [[1975]].

Retrieved [[June 3]] [[2006]].</ref> As time has passed, the film continues to generate a positive critical reception. For example, [[Christopher Null]] has said that the film "captures perfectly the [[zeitgeist]] of the early 1970s, a time when optimism was scraping rock bottom" and that "John Wojtowicz was as good a hero as we could come up with".<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dog_day_afternoon/ ''Dog Day Afternoon'' Reviews] on Rotten Tomatoes, quote by Christopher Null. Retrieved [[April 28]] [[2006]].</ref> P.F. Kluge, author of the article that inspired the film, believed that the filmmakers "stayed with the surface of a lively journalistic story" and that the film had a "strong, fast-paced story" without "reflection" or "a contemplative view of life".<ref>[http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/nyrm/2001/features/Movies.html "The Write Stuff: Magazine articles that make it to the Big Screen"] by Nina Rayburn Dec for the ''New York Review of Magazines''. Retrieved [[April 24]] [[2006]].</ref>

===References in popular culture===
During the confrontation with the police, Sonny shouts the word "Attica" in order to rile up the crowd of onlookers, and gain their support in opposition to the police. This single-word quote is listed at #86 on the [[American Film Institute|AFI's]] list of "[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]"<ref name="AFI">[http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/quotes.aspx ''100 Years...100 Movie Quotes''] for AFI, 2006. Retrieved [[April 24]] [[2006]].</ref>.

There have been numerous allusions to ''Dog Day Afternoon'' through the quoting of "Attica!" in movies and television over the last 30 years, including:

* CHuck in [[Early Edition]] says it while being led out of a city council meeting.
*''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''- Tony Manero ([[John Travolta]]), looking at a poster of Al Pacino in his bedroom.<ref>''Saturday Night Fever'' directed by John Badham for Paramount Pictures, released 1977.</ref> 
*[[Penn Jillette]], as he's escorted from a [[casino]] by security, ''[[Penn & Teller Get Killed]]''
*[[Dr. Gregory House]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]), to his boss in ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', "Lines in the Sand" episode 
*''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult|The Naked Gun 33⅓]]'', Lt. Frank Drebin ([[Leslie Nielsen]]), while undercover in a prison
*"Strike Out" episode of ''[[The King of Queens]]'', Arthur, when a police car drives by
*''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode, "[[Missing Identity]]", SpongeBob during a fantasy robbery sequence.
*''In the [[King of the Hill]]'' episode ''[[Dog Dale Afternoon]]'', [[Dale Gribble]] is in a similar situation, and the title is an obvious reference.
*[[Charlie Kelly]] ([[Charlie Day]]), while protesting the Paddy's new regime in ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'', "Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody's Ass" episode.
*In the ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' and [[RiffTrax]] commentaries, whenever a large group is seen shouting or chanting, the commentators will usually start shouting "Attica!" in the general voice of the crowd.
*''[[Third Watch]]'' (S1E3 ''[[Patterns (Third Watch)|Patterns]]'') - Officers [[John 'Sully' Sullivan|Sully]] and [[Tyrone Davis, Jr|Davis]] arrest "the clown-looking guy" at the [[New York Mets|Mets]] game and have "Attica! Attica!" shouted at them.
*''[[The Young Ones (TV series)]]'' In the final episode of the young ones just before they go to rob a bank Rick says this is it Dog day afternoon.
*''[[The Simpsons (TV series)]]'' [[I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]].  Marge is in a bank which is robbed by Dwight.
 
In the movie ''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'', John Travolta's character suggests that if Pacino had handled the hostage situation in ''Dog Day Afternoon'' as Pacino had originally told police he would (by "throwing bodies out the front door" to show he meant business), the robbery would have proven far more successful.<ref>''Swordfish'' directed by Dominic Sena for Village Roadshow Pictures and Warner Bros, released 2001.</ref> The film is also referenced in the [[Spike Lee]] film ''[[Inside Man]]'', also a film about a bank robbery and the resulting police siege, which featured many references to Al Pacino films.<ref>''Inside Man'' directed by Spike Lee for 40 Acres and a Mule Productions, Imagine Entertainment, and Universal Pictures. Released 2006.</ref> A 2000 documentary ''The Third Memory'', directed by [[Pierre Huyghe]], contrasted news footage of the actual robbery with ''Dog Day Afternoon'' and a contemporary retelling of the events by [[John Wojtowicz]].

The 1994 film ''[[Airheads]]'''s plot is similar to ''Dog Day Afternoon'', with its hostage situation, winning over the crowd with anti-establishment attitudes (chanting "[[Rodney King]], Rodney King!" instead of "Attica!"), and creating a live TV media circus.  In [[The Life and Times of Juniper Lee]], "Dog Show Afternoon" was the title of the 25th episode, where Monroe (the dog) enters a dog show, while Juniper looks for a magical creature that got into the arena.

A fourth-season episode of [[Code Lyoko]] is titled "[[List of Code Lyoko episodes#Season 4: 2007|Dog Day Afternoon]]".
