'''Balasaraswati''' ([[13 May]] [[1918]]-[[9 February]] [[1984]]) was a celebrated Indian dancer, and her rendering of [[Bharatanatyam]], a classical dance style, made this style of dancing of [[south India]] well known in different parts of [[India]], as also many parts of the world. 

==Early life==

She was born in a family of [[devadasi]]s, the temple dancers of India, and her family was having a long tradition of music and dancing. Her mother was Jayammal, who had to give up dancing in favor of music on account of certain constraints. She wanted her daughter to become a great dancer. Balasaraswati’s rigorous dancing training, imparted by her grandmother, commenced when she was just a toddler of two or three year. At the age of four, her formal dancing training was commenced, and her first teacher was Kandappan Pillai, a fine dancer and musician of his time.

Her debut as a dancer took place in the  [[Kamakshi Amman Temple]] of [[Kanchipuram]] ([[Tamilnadu]]),  when she was a child of seven. The word has gone around that the granddaughter of the celebrated dancer-devadasi, Veena Dhanammal, was to perform at the Temple, and a large crowd has gathered to watch the performance. The child did not exhibit any nervousness, and she enthralled the watchers with her rhythm and precision of movements. The event set her on a long and illustrious career of dancing.
