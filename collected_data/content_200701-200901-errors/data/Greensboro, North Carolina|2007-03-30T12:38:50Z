'''Greensboro, North Carolina''' ([[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ɡɹiːnsbʌɹəʊ]}}), is the largest city in [[Guilford County, North Carolina|Guilford County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]]. It is the largest city in the [[Piedmont Triad]] region.

As of the 2000 [[U.S. Census|census]], the city population was 223,891, making it the third most populous city in North Carolina. Its estimated [[2006]] population is 240,955.

It is located at the intersection of two major interstate highways ([[Interstate 85|I-85]] and [[Interstate 40|I-40]]) in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] ("foot of the mountains") region in central North Carolina.

In 1808, '''Greensborough''' (as it was spelled before 1895) was planned around a central courthouse square to replace [[Martinville, North Carolina|Guilford Court House]] as the [[county seat]]. This act moved the county courts closer to the geographical center of the county, a location more easily reached by a greater number of the county's citizens.

In 2004, the previous Greensboro - [[Winston-Salem]] - [[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]] [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan statistical area]] (MSA) was broken up by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], resulting in the formation of the Greensboro-High Point MSA and the Winston-Salem MSA. The 2004 Greensboro-High Point MSA estimate was 667,542. The Greensboro - Winston-Salem - High Point [[combined statistical area]], popularly referred to as the [[Piedmont Triad]], had an estimated population of 1,490,886 in 2005. ''Source: US Bureau of the Census, Released April 2006''

The city is home to several universities and colleges. The [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] (UNCG), [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]] (NCA&T), [[Guilford College]], [[Bennett College]], and [[Greensboro College]] all call Greensboro home. In addition, the state community college system has several campuses for [[Guilford Technical Community College]]. In August 2006, the [[Elon University School of Law]] opened a campus in downtown Greensboro.

The city is the home of the [[Greensboro Grasshoppers]] baseball club of the [[South Atlantic League]] and the [[Carolina Dynamo]] of the [[USL Premier Development League]]. The [[Wyndham Championship]], one of the oldest national [[PGA Tour]] [[golf]] events, is held annually in Greensboro at [[Forest Oaks Country Club]]. 

== History ==   
[[Image:nategreen.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A statue of Revolutionary War General [[Nathanael Greene]]]]   
The city was named for Major General [[Nathanael Greene]], commander of the American forces at the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]] on [[March 15]], [[1781]]. The Americans lost that battle but the [[Pyrrhic victory]] slowed [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]]' British forces enough to allow the Americans to prepare to defeat them at the [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Battle of Yorktown]], where the British were forced to surrender on [[October 19]], [[1781]], after a 20-day siege, thus ending the [[American Revolution]].   
    
In the early [[1840s]], Greensboro was selected by the state government at the request of then [[John Motley Morehead|Governor Morehead]] whose estate, [[Blandwood]], is located in Greensboro, to become a [[railroad]] hub and substantially grew in size. It soon became known as the Gateway City. The railroads transported goods to and from the [[textile]] industries, which grew up around Greensboro due to its location. Many of these businesses remained in the city until the 21st century, when many of them went bankrupt, reorganized, and/or merged with other companies. Greensboro remains as a major textile headquarters city with the main offices of International Textile Group (Cone, Burlington Industries), Galey & Lord, Unifi, and [[VF Corporation]] ([[Wrangler]], [[Lee (Jeans)|Lee]], North Face, [[Vanity Fair]]). Rail traffic continues as Greensboro is a major North Carolina freight hub, and four [[Amtrak]] passenger trains stop in Greensboro daily on the main [[Norfolk & Western]] line between [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[New Orleans]] by way of [[Atlanta]]. FedEx is scheduled to open a major hub near [[Piedmont Triad International Airport]].    
    
Greensboro has been known for being on the forefront of issues involving racial and ethnic equality, sometimes resulting in nationally known events. During the 19th century, with its large concentration of anti-slavery [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] near Guilford College (now part of Greensboro), the town was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]]. The Railroad helped to smuggle runaway slaves to freedom in the North. In the 1861 Secession Convention Vote, [[Guilford County, North Carolina|Guilford County]] voted against secession from the Union by a margin of 2771-to-112, the fourth largest "no" margin in the state. Later, in the 1890s, the city caught the attention of a number of Jews, who established a thriving business community headed by Moses and Ceasar Cone.   
   
[[Image:BlandwoodMansion.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A Picture of Blandwood Mansion, an A. J. Davis designed Tuscan Villa]]Though the city developed slowly, early wealth generated from cotton trade and merchandising led to the construction of several notable buildings. The earliest building, later named [[Blandwood Mansion and Gardens]], built in 1795. Additions to this residence in 1846 designed by [[A. J. Davis]] of [[New York City]] made the house an influential landmark in the nation as America's earliest Tuscan Villa. Other significant estates followed, including "Dunleith" designed by Samuel Sloan, Bellemeade, and the Bumpass-Troy House (now operated as an inn). Early civic architecture included the Guilford County Courthouse, West Market Street [[Methodist]] Church by S. W. Faulk, several buildings designed by Frank A. Weston, and [[UNCG]]'s Main Building designed by Orlo Epps. During the twentieth century, Greensboro expanded in wealth and population due to profitable textile and tobacco interests. Rapid growth led to construction of grand commercial and civic buildings many of which remain standing today, designed by hometown architects Charles Hartmann, Harry Barton, Ed Loewenstein, and nationally prominent designers such as [[Walter Gropius]], [[Eduardo Catalano]], and George Matsumoto.   
   
On [[February 1]], [[1960]], [[Greensboro Four|four black college students]] from [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University|North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College]] sat down at an all-white [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworths]] lunch counter, and refused to leave when they were denied service. Hundreds of others soon joined in this [[sit-in]], which lasted for several months. Such protests quickly spread across the South, ultimately leading to the [[desegregation]] of Woolworths and other chains. The original Woolworths counter and stools now sit in the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], but a Sit-In Museum is being built in the old Woolworths building where the event actually occurred.   

On [[November 3]], [[1979]], members of the [[Communist Workers Party (U.S.)|Communist Workers Party]] were holding an anti-[[Ku Klux Klan]] rally, when a group of KKK and [[neo-Nazis]] caravanned into the Morningside Heights neighborhood in which the rally was being convened and ambushed the protest. Four local TV stations filmed the event as it happened. The Klansmen/Nazis (members of the recently created United Racist Front) allegedly were given directions and a parade permit by an undercover agent of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] who attended Klan meetings and, it is believed, acted as the final impetus toward a showdown. The alleged actions of the BATF agent, as well as the evidence of other government informers who worked with the Klan at the time, have led to allegations of city/state/federal wrongdoing by members of the CWP. Although a pistol was probably fired by a CWP organizer (allegedly into the air) and the Klan caravan was beaten with sticks prior to stopping, only anti-Klan protesters were hurt. Five CWP members were killed and seven were wounded and television footage of the event was shown across the nation. This event is known as the [[Greensboro massacre]]. The Klansmen/Nazis were all acquitted by an all-white jury in two separate criminal trials. In 1985,  a civil suit found the five police and two individuals liable for $350,000 in damages, to be paid to the Greensboro Justice Fund. In 2005, some Greensboro residents, inspired by post-[[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], initiated a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to take public testimony and examine the causes and consequences of the massacre. It is the first Truth and Reconciliation Commission convened in the United States. 

Most recently, controversies have come to light within the Greensboro Police Department with allegations of racism, officers involved in crime and subsequent coverups, and internal power grabs. It has garnered even more attention since nationally known writer Jerry Bledsoe has been running a weekly story/newspiece in the local Rhinocerous Times recapping the events.  
 
===Neighborhoods===   
    
'''Greensboro's early neighborhoods include:''' College Hill, Bellemeade, Fisher Park, Sunset Hills and Aycock. These were the first neighborhoods to develop outside the central historical core of the city. Other historical neighborhoods developed after automobile use, including Starmount, Irving Park, Lake Daniel Park, Lindley Park, Hamilton Lakes, Rankin, O. Henry Oaks, and Glenwood. Recent additions to the city include the Southside neighborhood redevelopment, Adams Farm, Lake Jeanette, The Cardinal, New Irving Park, and Reedy Fork Ranch.

'''Greensboro's unique park-defined neighborhoods: '''Greensboro has a long and visionary tradition of establishing neighborhoods defined by their own unique park:  ''Starmount Forest Park, Lindley Park, Latham Park, Lake Daniel Park, Irving Park, Fisher Park, College Park, etc.''  Within each distinct park neighborhood there are often several subdivisions, varying in size and scope.  Greensboro's park neighborhoods often share a common feature - most private properties bordering the park are included in the legal plat map named after the park.  Frequently the bordering streets reflect the park's name, as well ''(Fisher Park, College Park, Lake Daniel Park, Starmount Forest Park.)''  These key characteristics were intentionally designed to define the neighborhood's identity, thus creating a pleasant environment to live, study, work and recreate/socialize.

==Sister cities==
Greensboro enjoys "[[sister city]]" status with two cities to foster international friendship and cooperation.<ref>[http://www.sister-cities.org/icrc/directory/usa/NC North Carolina sister cities]</ref>

==Geography and climate==
Greensboro is located at {{coor dms|36|4|48|N|79|49|10|W|city}} (36.079868, -79.819416).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 283.0 [[km²]] (109.2 [[square mile|mi²]]). 271.2 km² (104.7 mi²) of it is land and 11.8 km² (4.5 mi²) of it (4.16 %) is water.

Greensboro enjoys gently rolling hills and is midway between the mountains of North Carolina and its beaches to the east. A view of the city from its highest building&mdash;the Lincoln Financial tower&mdash;reveals that the town is populated with large numbers of green trees, giving perhaps another dimension to its name. The town is well-situated in terms of travel, with Interstates 40, 85, and the soon-to-be-built [[Interstate 73|I-73]] passing through its borders.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 223,891 people, 92,394 households, and 53,958 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 825.6/km² (2,138.3/mi²). There were 99,305 housing units at an average density of 366.2/km² (948.4/mi²). The racial makeup of the city was 55.49% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 37.40% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.44% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 2.84% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 2.08% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.71% from two or more races. 4.35% of the population were [[Hispanic American|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

There were 92,394 households out of which 27.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 14.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.6% were non-families. 32.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 2.94.

The age distribution is 22.3% under the age of 18, 14.1% from 18 to 24, 31.6% from 25 to 44, 20.2% from 45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females there were 89.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.6 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $39,661, and the median income for a family was $50,192. Males had a median income of $34,681 versus $26,797 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $22,986. About 8.6% of families and 12.3% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 15.8% of those under age 18 and 10.6% of those age 65 or over.

===Asians===
Perhaps the greatest number of immigrants have arrived from Asia. The [[Vietnamese]] are the largest single [[refugee]] population to be resettled in the US in the last 30 years. About 4,000 have resettled in the Greensboro area since 1979 as refugees or secondary migrants. They are a diverse population culturally, ethnically, and religiously, and not organized through any broad based structure. The [[Degar|Montagnards]] (French for "mountain people") are people from a number of different tribes from the Highlands of [[Vietnam]]. They had been isolated mountain farmers and hunter-gatherers until the Vietnam War when the US government recruited them as front line soldiers for the US Army Special Forces. About 5,000 have now settled in Guilford County making it the largest Montagnard community outside Vietnam. Over 1000 live in the Charlotte and Raleigh areas combined. A few hundred Nung, a tribal group from northern Vietnam, have been resettled here too and are often grouped with the Montagnard tribes. The total Montagnard population for the state is approaching 7,000 people. In the early 1980s, the first [[Cambodian]] refugees were resettled in Greensboro. A stable community of about 60 large families representing about 500 people are closely affiliated with the Greensboro [[Buddhist]] Center. An additional 800 Cambodians live around the Triad including a large concentration in nearby [[Davidson County]]. Greensboro was not an initial resettlement site for Laotians. However, since the mid 1980s many families came as secondary migrants from other states, and now the Laotian population is stabilized at about 1000 people. North Carolina has a few thousand hill tribe refugees from [[Laos]], mostly [[Hmong]], who migrated from other states to rural areas of North Carolina plus new arrivals who came in 2005. A few families live in Guilford County plus over 50 college students at UNCG, but over 15,000 have resettled in the state, mostly in the western Piedmont areas. Other hill tribe populations from Laos in Guilford include approximately 200 [[Khmu]] refugees as well as small groups of other tribes. About 2,000 Korean immigrants, many well established, are represented in Guilford County. An additional 2,000 live in the extended Triad area. The local Chinese Association, comprised primarily of mainland Chinese, has a few hundred members. Ethnic Chinese here number in the thousands.

An [[India|Indian]] immigrant population estimated at 2000 is well established in the Guilford area and has a long history here. Many are connected with university and medical communities and have multiple community organizations. There are an estimated 600 [[Pakistanis]] living in Guilford County. There are estimates of over 1,000 [[Palestinians]] in the Guilford County area, and additional thousands in the greater Triad. Many came after the war in 1967. A few hundred [[Israeli]] nationals have also come to the Triad, particularly in international business positions.

===Africans===
There are close to 15,000 people from many of the 54 African nations living in Guilford County, but no official population numbers are available because the census categorizes these people as African-American or Black. They come from Christian, Muslim, and traditional religious orientations and represent numerous tribal affiliations. About 10 percent of Guilford County's African population are refugees. The African Services Coalition, a nonprofit organization composed of representatives from different African communities, seeks to foster cooperation between the various communities. Some communities have roots at NC A&T State University that go back to the sixties when the university was recognized as a valuable educational resource by developing countries. The Nigerian population is an older, well-established community believed to be the largest African community in Guilford County with about 3,500 people, including second and third generations. This group reflects a variety of religious and tribal traditions. Many of the Nigerians in Guilford County first lived in New York, New Jersey or Washington D.C, and settled in Guilford County after obtaining official status. Guilford County has a long-term, multigenerational Ghanaian population consisting of approximately 450 people. The few new arrivals are mostly international students at area universities, or friends and family members of previous residents. A well established population of 800 people of Sierra Leonese ancestry has made Guilford County their home. This population has either stayed the same or decreased because the temporary protective status that used to be available to some immigrants from this area has been ended.

The Sudanese population is a diverse population. Most Sudanese have come to Guilford County within the last five years and are currently more than 2,700 people. Many are fleeing the long-standing war in this largest country of Africa. A group of young Sudanese from the south, commonly referred to as the "Lost Boys", have been recently resettled as refugees. Most Sudanese, however, are Muslims from the north. In the last year, many have become citizens, which has allowed people to bring family members from Sudan, leading to a population increase of several hundred in the last year.

An estimated 3,000 people from Niger have arrived in the last few years. This is one of the newest and fastest growing African populations. There are approximately 400 refugees from [[Somalia]] who have arrived in the last six years, including Benadir from the city of Mogadishu and newly arriving refugees from the Bantu tribe. There are an estimated 1,200 Liberians settled in Guilford County. This population includes some refugees who are recent arrivals, and others who have lived in Guilford County for many years. In the last couple of years, a few hundred Liberian refugees who had been living in refugee camps in the [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Ghana]] have been resettled in Guilford County.

===Eastern Europeans===
Settlers have also arrived from Eastern Europe. From the former [[Yugoslavia]] (including Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia, and others from former Yugoslavia that have been arriving since 1994 as refugees. There are around 2,000 people who have been resettled here. Greensboro has been a resettlement site in the last few years for approximately 250 Russian and Ukrainian refugees, most of them Jewish. In the last few years a few families totaling less than 200 people have been resettled in Guilford as refugees. Some others have come as secondary migrants.

===Latin Americans===
The Hispanic/Latino population poses some of the greatest opportunities and challenges for acculturation. They are at the core of the North Carolina economic boom of the nineties as farm, factory, and construction workers.  They now have young children born here who are US citizens, growing up as bilingual and bicultural North Carolinians.  According to the 2002 and 2003 estimates of Latino population in Guilford County published by Faith Action Inc, there was a 4% increase in Latino population between those years, and in 2003 the population was 26,981. Though there were not follow up studies using this method, we can estimate that if population continued to increase by 4% annually, the current Latino population would be approximately 29,182. Other studies indicate the rate of increase may be even more. This dramatic Hispanic/Latino increase is sufficient to move Guilford County and much of North Carolina into becoming a bilingual and bicultural state.

The predominant immigrant population across North Carolina is a growing and diverse Hispanic/Latino population. Over two thirds of these immigrants are from Mexico, though it is thought that all 26 countries are represented. Most Hispanic/Latinos have arrived since 1990. Growth is expected to continue as long as economic opportunities prevail.

==Economy==
[[Image:Dtgsotowers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Downtown Greensboro]]
Greensboro is the location of the corporate headquarters of the [[Honda Aircraft Company]], [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]], [[VF Corporation]], [[Volvo Trucks]] of North America, [[RF Micro Devices]], and the [[International Textile Group]]. Jefferson-Pilot Life was based in Greensboro until it merged with [[Lincoln Financial Group]]; the corporate headquarters of the combined company are now in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. However, The insurance division of Lincoln Financial is based in Greensboro. Although traditionally associated with the textile, furniture, and tobacco industries, Greensboro is attempting to attract new businesses in the nanotech, high-tech and transportation/logistics fields.

===FedEx===
In 1998, [[FedEx]] chose to build and operate a $300 million Mid-Atantic air-cargo package-sorting hub at the [[Piedmont Triad International Airport]], opening by 2009. The hub is expected to attract thousands of jobs and build on the city's effort in becoming a transportation, distribution and logistics hub. The planned hub has already had an effect in attracting development to Greenboro and the [[Piedmont Triad]] region. The planned FedEx hub has attracted developments such as [[Triad Tower]], a planned 25-story office/condominium project for Greensboro near [[Piedmont Triad International Airport]] and near the [[Interstate 40]] and the Highway 68 interchange. Other projects the planned hub has attracted included a [[Dell]] computer manufacturing facility in the nearby city of [[Winston-Salem]] and [[Honda Aircraft Company]] jet factory/world headquarters in Greensboro.

===Honda Aircraft Company===
In February 2007, [[Honda Aircraft Company]] announced that they will build a multi-million dollar jet factory and world headquarters at [[Piedmont Triad International Airport]].
