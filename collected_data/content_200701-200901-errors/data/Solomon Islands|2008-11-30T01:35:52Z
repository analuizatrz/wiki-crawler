The '''Solomon Islands''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Solomon Islands.ogg|[ˈsɑləmən ˈaɪləndz]}} is a country in [[Melanesia]], east of [[Papua New Guinea]], consisting of nearly one thousand islands. Together they cover a land mass of 28,400&nbsp;square kilometres (10,965&nbsp;[[Square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]). The capital is [[Honiara]], located on the island of [[Guadalcanal]].

The Solomon Islands are believed to have been inhabited by [[Melanesia]]n people for thousands of years. The [[United Kingdom]] established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in the 1890s. Some of the most bitter fighting of [[World War II]] occurred in the [[Solomon Islands campaign]] of 1942–45, including the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]. Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm]].

Since 1998 ethnic violence, government misconduct and crime have undermined stability and civil society. In June 2003 (following the [[Invasion of Iraq]]) an [[Australia]]n-led "multinational" force, the [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI), arrived to restore peace and disarm ethnic militias.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

The [[North Solomon Islands]] are divided between the independent Solomon Islands and [[Bougainville Province]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].

==History==
{{main|History of the Solomon Islands}}
[[Image:Solomon Islands canoe.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Solomon Island warriors with spears in ornamented war canoe in [[1895]].]]

It is believed that [[East Papuan languages|Papuan]] speaking settlers began to arrive around 30,000 BC.  [[Austronesia]]n speakers arrived circa 4,000 BC also bringing cultural elements such as the [[outrigger canoe]].  It is between 1,200 and 800 BC that the ancestors of the [[Polynesia]]ns, the [[Lapita]] people, arrived from the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] with their characteristic [[ceramic]]s.<ref>[[Patrick Vinton Kirch|Kirch, Patrick Vinton]] (2002). [http://books.google.com/books?id=qQ0ApgIOPtEC&dq=on+the+road+of+the+winds&pg=PP1&ots=Xau5vtVLvU&sig=d68IBljvyU7n45mBsKx8yFjOE0E&prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Don%2Bthe%2Broad%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bwinds%26btnG%3DGoogle%2BSearch&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title#PPP6,M1 ''On the Road of the Winds: An Archaeological History of the Pacific Islands'']. Berkley, California: University of California Press. ISBN 0520234618</ref> The first [[Europe]]an to discover the islands was the [[Spain|Spanish]] navigator [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], coming from [[Peru]] in 1568. 

Missionaries began visiting the Solomons in the mid-19th century. They made little progress at first, because "[[blackbirding]]" (the often brutal recruitment of laborers for the sugar plantations in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]]) led to a series of reprisals and massacres. The evils of the labor trade prompted the [[United Kingdom]] to declare a protectorate over the southern Solomons in 1893. This was the basis of the '''British Solomon Islands Protectorate'''. In 1898 and 1899, more outlying islands were added to the protectorate; in 1900 [[Bougainville Province|the remainder of the archipelago]], an area previously under German jurisdiction, was transferred to British administration apart from the islands of [[Buka Island|Buka]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] which remained under German administration as part of German New Guinea (until they were occupied by Australia in 1914, after the commencement of World War I). Traditional trade and social intercourse between the western Solomon islands of Mono and Alu (the Shortlands) and the traditional societies in the south of Bougainville, however, continued without hindrance. Under the protectorate, missionaries settled in the Solomons, converting most of the population to Christianity. In the early 20th century, several British and Australian firms began large-scale [[coconut]] planting. Economic growth was slow, however, and the islanders benefited little.

====World War II====
{{main|Solomon Islands campaign|Battle of Guadalcanal}} 
With the outbreak of World War II, most planters and traders were evacuated to Australia, and most cultivation ceased. Some of the most intense fighting of [[World War II]] occurred in the Solomons. The most significant of the Allied Forces' operations against the [[Japanese Imperial]] Forces was launched on August 7, 1942 with simultaneous naval bombardments and amphibious landings on the [[Florida Islands]] at [[Tulagi]] and Red Beach on [[Guadalcanal]]. The [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] became an important and bloody campaign fought in the Pacific War as the Allies began to repulse Japanese expansion. Of strategic importance during the war were the [[coastwatchers]] operating in remote locations, often on Japanese held islands, providing early warning and intelligence of Japanese naval, army and aircraft movements during the campaign. Sergeant-Major [[Jacob Vouza]] was a notable [[Coastwatchers|coastwatcher]] who after capture refused to divulge Allied information in spite of interrogation and torture by Japanese Imperial forces. He was awarded a [[Silver Star]] by the Americans. Islanders [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]] would be noted by [[National Geographic]] for being the first to find the shipwrecked [[John F. Kennedy]] and his crew of the [[PT-109]]. They suggested using a coconut to write a rescue message for delivery by dugout canoe, which was later kept on his desk when he became the president of the United States.[[Image:US tanks in Guadalcanal.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The U.S. employment of tanks in Guadalcanal was hampered by the nature of the terrain]] The Solomon Islands was one of the major staging areas of the South Pacific and was home to the legendary [[VMA-214|VMF-214 "Black Sheep" Squadron]] commanded by [[Pappy Boyington|Major Greg "Pappy" Boyington]]. '''The Slot''' was a name for [[New Georgia Sound]], when it was used by the [[Tokyo Express]] to supply the Japanese garrison on Guadalcanal.

===Independence movement===
Following the end of World War II, the British [[colonial government]] returned. The capital was moved from [[Tulagi]] to [[Honiara]] to take advantage of the infrastructure left behind by the U.S. military. A revolutionary movement known as [[Maasina Ruru]] helped to organize and focus a mass campaign of [[civil disobedience]] and strikes across the islands. There was much disorder and the leaders were jailed in late-1948. Throughout the 1950s, other indigenous dissident groups appeared and disappeared without gaining strength. In 1960, an advisory council of Solomon Islanders was superseded by a legislative council, and an executive council was created as the protectorate's policymaking body. The council was given progressively more authority. In 1974, a new constitution was adopted establishing a parliamentary democracy and ministerial system of government. In mid-1975, the name Solomon Islands officially replaced that of British Solomon Islands Protectorate.

On January 2, 1976, the Solomons became self-governing, and independence followed on July 7, 1978, the first post-independence government being elected in August 1980. The series of governments formed since have not performed to upgrade and build the country. Following the 1997 election of [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]] the political situation in the Solomons began to deteriorate. Governance was slipping as the performance of the police and other government agencies deteriorated due to what is commonly known as "the tensions".

===Tensions===
Commonly referred to as ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension'', the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army) and the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (as well as the [[Marau Eagle Force]]).  (Although much of the conflict was between Guales and Malaitans, [http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/melanesia/working_papers/tarcisiusworkingpaper.htm Kabutaulaka (2001)] and Dinnen (2002) argue that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification).   For detailed discussions of The Tensions, see also Fraenkel (2004) and Moore (2004).  

In late 1998, militants on the island of Guadalcanal commenced a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. During the next year, thousands of Malaitans fled back to Malaita or to the capital, Honiara (which, although situated on Guadalcanal, is predominantly populated by Malaitans and Solomon Islanders from other provinces). In 1999, the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (MEF) was established in response. 

The reformist government of [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]] struggled to respond to the complexities of this evolving conflict.  In late 1999, the government declared a four month state of emergency.  There were also a number of attempts at reconciliation ceremonies but to no avail. He also requested assistance from Australia and New Zealand in 1999 but this was rejected. 

In June 2000, Ulufa'alu was kidnapped by militia members of the [[Malaita Eagle Force|MEF]] who felt that although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. Ulufa'alu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release. [[Manasseh Sogavare]], who had earlier been Finance Minister in Ulufa'alu's government but had subsequently joined the opposition, was elected as Prime Minister by 23-21 over Rev. Leslie Boseto.  However Sogavare's election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six MPs (thought to be supporters of Boseto) were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote (Moore 2004, n.5 on p.174). 

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:IriquoisHenderson.jpg|thumbnail|250px|[[New Zealand]]'s air force returns to Henderson field as part of the RAMSI force]] -->
In October 2000, the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]],<ref>[http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm Untitled Document<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.commerce.gov.sb</ref> was signed by the Malaita Eagle Force, elements of the IFM and the Solomon Islands Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the Isatabu Freedom Movement, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government and the Solomon Islands Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, Harold Keke, refused to sign the Agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the Agreement led by Andrew Te'e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the 'Joint Operations Force'. During the next two years the conflict moved to the Weathercoast of Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.

New elections in December 2001 brought Sir [[Allan Kemakeza]] into the Prime Minister’s chair with the support of his People's Alliance Party and also the Association of Independent Members. Law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted: there was continuing violence on the Weathercoast whilst militants in Honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime and extortion. The Department of Finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive. In December 2002, Finance Minister Laurie Chan resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. Renegade members of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) were invited in as a protection force but ended up causing as much trouble as they prevented. 

The prevailing atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the Solomon Islands Government for outside help. With the country bankrupt and the capital in chaos, the request was unanimously supported in Parliament. 

In July 2003, Australian and Pacific Island police and troops arrived in the Solomon Islands under the auspices of the Australian-led [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI). A sizable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and with representatives from about 20 other Pacific nations began arriving the next month under [[Operation Helpem Fren]]. Since this time some commentators have considered the country a [[failed state]].<ref>[http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault.php?urlpinaid=9609 Solomon Is: Failed State or Not Failed State?] October 29, 2003. ''Pacific Magazine'' URL Accessed 2006-05-04</ref>

In April 2006 allegations that the newly elected Prime Minister [[Snyder Rini]] had used bribes from Chinese businessmen to buy the votes of members of Parliament led to mass rioting in the capital [[Honiara]]. A deep underlying resentment against the minority Chinese business community led to much of Chinatown in the city being destroyed. Tensions had also been increased by the belief that large sums of money were being exported to China. [[People's Republic of China|China]] sent chartered aircraft to evacuate hundreds of Chinese who fled to avoid the riots. Evacuation of Australian and British citizens was on a much smaller scale.  Further Australian, New Zealand and Fijian police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest. Rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in Parliament, and Parliament elected [[Manasseh Sogavare]] as Prime Minister.

===Sport===
The [[Solomon Islands national football team]] made history by becoming the first team to beat [[New Zealand]] into qualifying for a play-off spot against [[Australia]] for qualification to the [[World Cup 2006]]. They were soundly beaten 7-0 in Australia and 2-1 at home.

On June 14 2008, the national Solomon Island [[Futsal]] team won the Oceania Futsal Championship in Fiji to qualify them for the [[2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup]] which will commence on September 30th, 2008 in Brazil.

The Solomon Islands' [[beach soccer]] team is considered the best team in [[Oceania]] , and has qualified for the last three [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]]s.

===2007 earthquake and tsunami===
{{main|2007 Solomon Islands earthquake and tsunami}}

On 2 April 2007, the Solomon Islands were struck by a major earthquake followed by a large [[tsunami]]. Initial reports indicated that the tsunami, which mainly affected the small island of [[Gizo, Solomon Islands|Gizo]], was several metres in height (perhaps as high as 10 metres (33&nbsp;ft) according to some reports, 5 metres (16 1/3&nbsp;ft) according to the Foreign Office).  The tsunami was triggered by an 8.1 magnitude earthquake, with an epicenter 217 miles (349&nbsp;km) northwest of the island's capital, [[Honiara]], at Lat -8.453 Long 156.957 and at a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2 miles).<ref>[http://www.breakinglegalnews.com/entry/Solomon-Islands-earthquake-and-tsunami "Solomon Islands earthquake and tsunami"], Breaking Legal News - International, 04-03-2007</ref>

According to the United States Geologic Survey the earthquake struck at  20:39:56 UTC on Sunday, 1 April 2007. Since the initial event and up until  22:00:00 UTC on Wednesday, 4 April 2007, more than 44 aftershocks of a magnitude of 5.0 or greater were recorded in the region.

The death toll from the resulting tsunami was at least 52&nbsp;people, and the tsunami destroyed more than 900 homes and has left thousands of people homeless.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6520461.stm "Aid reaches tsunami-hit Solomons"], ''BBC News'', 2007-04-03</ref>

Land thrust from the quake has extended out from the shoreline of one island, [[Ranongga]], by up to 70 meters (230&nbsp;ft) according to local residents.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news95163840.html Quake lifts Solomons island metres from the sea]</ref>  This has left many once pristine coral reefs exposed on the newly formed beaches.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the Solomon Islands}}
[[Image:SI Houses of Parliament.jpg|thumb|right|Houses of Parliament]]
The Solomon Islands are a [[constitutional monarchy]] and have a [[parliamentary system]] of government. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[Monarch of the Solomon Islands]] and the [[head of state]]; she is represented by the [[Governor-General of the Solomon Islands|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the [[Parliament]] for a five-year term. There is a [[unicameral]] parliament of 50 members, elected for four-year terms. However, Parliament may be dissolved by majority vote of its members before the completion of its term. Parliamentary representation is based on single-member constituencies. Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 21.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bp.html CIA - The World Factbook - Solomon Islands<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands|Prime Minister]], who is elected by Parliament and chooses the other members of the [[cabinet]]. Each ministry is headed by a cabinet member, who is assisted by a [[permanent secretary]], a career public servant, who directs the staff of the ministry.

Solomon Islands governments are characterized by weak political parties (see [[List of political parties in Solomon Islands]]) and highly unstable parliamentary coalitions. They are subject to frequent votes of no confidence, and government leadership changes frequently as a result. Cabinet changes are common.

Land ownership is reserved for Solomon Islanders. The law provides that resident expatriates, such as the Chinese and [[Kiribati]], may obtain citizenship through naturalization. Land generally is still held on a family or village basis and may be handed down from mother or father according to local custom. The islanders are reluctant to provide land for nontraditional economic undertakings, and this has resulted in continual disputes over land ownership.

No military forces are maintained by the Solomon Islands, although a police force of nearly 500 includes a border protection unit. The police also are responsible for fire service, disaster relief, and maritime surveillance. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the governor-general and responsible to the prime minister. On 27 December 2006, the Solomon Islands Government said it had taken steps to prevent the country's Australian police chief from returning to the Pacific nation. On 12 January 2007, Australia replaced its top diplomat expelled from the Solomon Islands for political interference in a conciliatory move aimed at easing a four-month dispute between the two countries.

On 11 July 2007, the Solomon Islands swore [[Julian Moti]] in as their Attorney General.  Moti is currently wanted in Australia for child-related sex offences.  Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] called the move "quite extraordinary".  Australia's Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] has described the country as the "laughing stock" of the civilised world.<ref>[http://news.sbs.com.au/worldnewsaustralia/solomons_a_39laughing_stock39_127361 "Solomons a 'laughing stock'"], - ''[[SBS World News]]'', - 2007-07-11</ref> However the Australian charges against Moti relate to events in Vanuatu, and parallel charges which the courts in Vanuatu dismissed in the 1990s. Julian Moti has attracted Australian attention because he advised the Solomons Government to inquire into the role of Australian police in provoking the 2006 Honiara riots.

On 13 December 2007, Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] was toppled by a [[vote of no confidence]] in Parliament,<ref>Sireheti, Joanna., & Joy Basi, - [http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=1090 "Solomon Islands PM Defeated in No-Confidence Motion"], - ''[[Solomon Times]]'', - 13 December 2007</ref> following the defection of five Ministers to the Opposition. It was the first time a Prime Minister lost office in this way in the Solomon Islands. On 20 December, Parliament elected the Opposition's candidate (and former Minister for Education) [[Derek Sikua]] as Prime Minister, with 32 votes to 15.<ref>Tuhaika, Nina., - [http://www.solomontimes.com:80/news.aspx?nwID=1130 "New Prime Minister for Solomon Islands"], - ''[[Solomon Times]]'', - 20 December 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/s2123875.htm "Solomon Islands parliament elects new PM"], - [[ABC Radio Australia]], - 20 December 2007</ref>

==Provinces==

{{main|Provinces of the Solomon Islands}}
For local government, the country is divided into 10 administrative areas, of which nine are provinces administered by elected provincial assemblies, and the 10th is the town of Honiara, administered by the Honiara Town Council.

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of the Solomon Islands}}
Solomon Islands is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], [[South Pacific Commission]], [[South Pacific Forum]], [[International Monetary Fund]], and the European Economic Community/African, Caribbean, Pacific Group (EEC/ACP)/(Lome Convention).

The political stage of the Solomon Islands is further influenced by its diplomatic importance to [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|the Republic of China on Taiwan]] and [[Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China|the People's Republic of China]]. The Solomon Islands gives [[diplomatic recognition]] to the ROC, recognizing it as the sole-legitimate Government of all of China, giving Taiwan vital votes in the [[United Nations]]. Lucrative investments, political funding and preferential loans from both the ROC and PRC are increasingly manipulating the political landscape of the Solomon Islands.

Relations with [[Papua New Guinea]], which had become strained because of an influx of refugees from the [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] rebellion and attacks on the northern islands of the Solomon Islands by elements pursuing Bougainvillean rebels, have been repaired. A peace accord on Bougainville confirmed in 1998 has removed the armed threat, and the two nations regularized border operations in a 2004 agreement.

==Military==
Although the locally-recruited [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force]] was part of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces taking part in fighting in the Solomons during World War II, the country has not had any regular military forces since independence. The various paramilitary elements of the Royal Solomon Islands Police (RSIP) were disbanded in 2003 following the intervention of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), and the RSIP was disarmed. RAMSI has a small military detachment headed by an Australian commander with responsibilities for assisting the police element of RAMSI in internal and external security. The RSIP still operates two patrol boats (RSIPV Auki and RSIPV Lata) which constitute the navy of the Solomon Islands.

In the long-term it is anticipated that the RSIP will resume the defense role. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the [[governor general]] and responsible to the prime minister.

The police budget of the Solomon Islands has been strained due to a four-year [[civil war]]. Following [[Cyclone Zoe]]'s strike on the islands of [[Tikopia]] and [[Anuta]] in December 2002, Australia had to provide the Solomon Islands government with 200,000 Solomons ($50,000 Australian) for fuel and supplies for the patrol boat Lata to sail with relief supplies. (Part of the work of [[RAMSI]] includes assisting the Solomon Islands Government to stabilise its budget.)

The Solomon Islands is a wide island nation that lies East of [[Papua New Guinea]] and consists of many islands: [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], the [[Shortland Islands]]; the [[New Georgia Islands]]; [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]]; the [[Russell Islands]]; [[Nggela]] (the [[Florida Islands]]); [[Malaita]]; [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]]; [[Sikaiana]]; [[Maramasike]]; [[Ulawa]]; [[Uki]]; [[Makira]] ([[San Cristobal (Solomon Islands)|San Cristobal]]); [[Santa Ana (Solomon Islands)|Santa Ana]]; [[Rennell and Bellona]]; the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] and three remote, tiny outliers, [[Tikopia]], [[Anuta]], and [[Fatutaka]]. The distance between the westernmost and easternmost islands is about 1,500 kilometres (930&nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]). The Santa Cruz Islands (of which [[Tikopia]] is part), are situated north of [[Vanuatu]] and are especially isolated at more than 200 kilometres (120&nbsp;mi) from the other islands. [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] is geographically part of the Solomon Islands, but politically [[Papua New Guinea]].

The islands' ocean-equatorial climate is extremely humid throughout the year, with a mean temperature of 27&nbsp;°C (80&nbsp;°F) and few extremes of temperature or weather. June through August is the cooler period. Though seasons are not pronounced, the northwesterly winds of November through April bring more frequent rainfall and occasional squalls or cyclones. The annual rainfall is about 3050&nbsp;mm (120&nbsp;in).

The Solomon Islands [[archipelago]] is part of two distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s. Most of the islands are part of the [[Solomon Islands rain forests]] ecoregion, which also includes the islands of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] and Buka, which are part of [[Papua New Guinea]], these forests have come under pressure from forestry activities. The [[Santa Cruz Islands]] are part of the [[Vanuatu rain forests]] ecoregion, together with the neighboring archipelago of [[Vanuatu]]. Soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic (there are [[volcano]]es with varying degrees of activity on some of the larger islands) to relatively infertile limestone. More than 230 varieties of orchids and other tropical flowers brighten the landscape.

The islands contain several active and dormant volcanoes. The Tinakula and Kavachi volcanoes are the most active.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of the Solomon Islands}}

Its per capita GDP of $600 ranks Solomon Islands as a lesser developed nation, and more than 75% of its labor force is engaged in subsistence  and fishing. Most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. Until 1998, when world prices for tropical timber fell steeply, timber was Solomon Islands main export product, and, in recent years, Solomon Islands forests were dangerously overexploited. Other important cash crops and exports include [[copra]] and [[palm oil]]. In 1998 Ross Mining of Australia began producing gold at [[Gold Ridge]] on Guadalcanal. Minerals exploration in other areas continued. However in the wake of the ethnic violence in June 2000, exports of palm oil and gold ceased while exports of timber fell. The islands are rich in undeveloped [[mineral]] resources such as [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]], and [[gold]].

Solomon Islands' fisheries also offer prospects for export and domestic economic expansion. However, a Japanese joint venture, Solomon Taiyo Ltd., which operated the only fish cannery in the country, closed in mid-2000 as a result of the ethnic disturbances. Though the plant has reopened under local management, the export of tuna has not resumed. Negotiations are underway which may lead to the eventual reopening of the Gold Ridge mine and the major oil-palm plantation.

Tourism, particularly diving, is an important service industry for Solomon Islands. Growth in that industry is hampered, however, by lack of infrastructure and transportation limitations.

The Solomon Islands Government was insolvent by 2002. Since the RAMSI intervention in 2003, the government has recast its budget, and has taken a hard look at priorities. It has consolidated and renegotiated its domestic debt and with Australian backing, is now seeking to renegotiate its foreign obligations. Principal aid donors are Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan, and the Republic of China.

Recently, the Solomons courts have re-approved the export of live dolphins for profit, most recently to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. This practice was originally stopped by the government in 2004 after international uproar over a shipment of 28 live dolphins to Mexico. The move has resulted in criticism from both Australia and New Zealand as well as several conservation organisations.

{{main|Culture of the Solomon Islands}}

In the traditional culture of the Solomon Islands, age-old customs are handed down from one generation to the next, allegedly from the ancestral spirits themselves, to form the cultural values to Solomon Islands.

The most popular sport in the Solomon Islands is soccer, with netball also very popular.

Radio is the most influential type of media in the Solomons Islands due to language differences and illiteracy.<ref>BBC News.
