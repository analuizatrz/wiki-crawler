'''Zugg's MUD Client''' ('''zMUD''') is a [[MUD client]] developed by [[Zuggsoft]]. It was first developed in [[1995]], and was made into [[shareware]] in [[1996]].  It supports several enhancements to standard [[telnet]] such as the [[MUD eXtension Protocol]] (MXP) and the [[MUD Compression Protocol]] (MCCP) and features advanced mapping capabilities.

Recently, a new version has been announced by Zugg, to be known as CMUD.
