These characters first appeared or only featured in the Chapter Black Saga of YuYu Hakusho (episodes 67-94).

===New Recruits===


* '''[[Yu Kaito]]''' (海藤優 ''Kaitō Yū'') (Romanized as ''Yu Kaito'' in the English-language manga and ''Yu Kaitou'' in the English-language anime) - A spectacled classmate of Kurama who is jealous of him because he always comes in second. He has somewhat of a stuck-up personality and is also really good at video games. His power is taboo; anyone in his territory that says the taboo word (such as removing a letter from the alphabet or a word) loses his or her soul. Apparently his friends took him to Genkai after he'd broken his own taboo and got his soul removed. Kaitou was the first of Genkai's Recruits to challenge Yusuke's friends in the House of Four Dimensions, defeating almost all the team except for Kurama. Kaitou later helps the team out during the Game Master's challenge, but fails to defeat the 'Goblin King.' He's also one of the few persons who keep some degree of contact with Kurama after he departs for the Demon World, following Yomi's invitation.


* '''Asato Kido''' (木戸亜沙斗 ''Kido Asato''): Kido is a human with psychic powers, gained with the opening of the hole between the human and demon worlds. He is friends with Yana and Kaitou, who all reside in Mushiyori City. Kido and his friends went to Genkai for help and joined Yusuke's team. He appears early in the saga in a plot arranged by Genkai to let Yusuke see what he will be encountering with Sensui and the others. Kido's power is with shadows. By stepping on someone's shadow, he paralyzes them and renders them immobile. Kido can also move his shadow independently from his body and affect the natural world, such as writing a name in blood while otherwise paralyzed. Kido's spine was severed while they were in pursuit of Doctor, but still managed to name the culprit by writing the name in his own blood with his shadow. Not surprisingly, with the severity of his injuries, Kido was put out of action until the end of the saga. 


* '''[[Mitsunari Yanagisawa]]''' (柳沢みつなり ''Yanagisawa Mitsunari''): Yanagisawa (known to all as simply Yana) is in league with Kido and Kaitou in Genkai's plot. His power is the Copy Technique. With it, he is able to fully become another person, copying everything about them including their physical appearance, memories, and even their energy imprint, which renders Botan's Megiru Seals incapable of determining the difference, proved evident when he is able to impersonate Kuwabara completely during Genkai’s trial. He later copies Murota, in order to establish what side he was on.


* '''Shigeru Murota''' (室田繁''Murota Shigeru''): Murota is a human with the ability to read minds. He plans to use his powers to be a professional boxer- by anticipating attacks, he can easily avoid them. He starts a fight with Yusuke in a restaurant, thinking he can defeat him. Even with his powers, Murota is still defeated in the brawl. He is later injured by Sniper, and taken to the hospital where Doctor is and is poisoned by a Makai Insect. Shortly after helping Yusuke in defeating Doctor, Murota is attacked and consumed by Gourmet.

===Sensui's Seven===

* '''[[Shinobu Sensui]]''' 


* '''Tsukihito Amanuma''' (天沼月人 ''Amanuma Tsukihito''), a.k.a. Game Master - An eleven-year-old who is obsessed with games and is a part of Sensui's seven.  He has the power to make any game he wants a reality. For the most part he is unaware of Sensui's true plans. Kurama is forced to kill the boy during one of his games. He is later resurrected by Koenma's pacifer with some of the Mafukan (魔封環) energy.


* '''Kaname Hagiri''' (刃霧要 ''Hagiri Kaname''), a.k.a. Sniper - One of the more callous members of Sensui's entourage, and maybe the most loyal to his boss after Itsuki, Sniper has the ability to launch objects at incredible velocities.  In his battle against Yusuke, he employs a bizarre attack that tattoos Yusuke's skin; the tattoos, as it turns out, attract any object that Sniper launches at Yusuke.  After several failed attacks (Consisting of a volley of rocks, then a volley of knives), he launches a semi truck at Yusuke.  When it becomes obvious that this will fail as well, Sniper pulls out a gun and blasts the gas tank.   Fortunately, Hiei pulls Yusuke away from the explosion.  Hiei then routs Sniper by ramming his katana into his chest, but deliberately misses his vital organs. He is later found by his former teammate Kamiya, who saves him. Afterwards, Hagiri returns to his family and his High School, only to disappear after graduation; he's also seen punishing bullies, such as a group of kids who killed a kitten.


* '''Yaminade no Itsuki''' (闇撫の樹), a.k.a. Gate Keeper - Itsuki is a rare-breed yokai called a yaminade ("hand that strokes the darkness"). He had been captured by the young detective Sensui, but when asked if he had any last words, Itsuki asked Sensui if he'd kill him tomorrow, as he was wanting to watch the finale of his favorite TV show. Sensui was so surprised to hear such a human thing from a creature he'd thought to be wicked, he laughed and decided not to kill him. After Sensui's fall into madness, Itsuki stayed by the young man's side as a faithful partner and companion. It is implied that he is Sensui's lover; this information was cut out in the American edited version and softened in other dubs (like the Latin-American one) so Itsuki's love is more-or-less a one-sided one, with more emphasis on his understanding of Sensui and his mission. He can open up dimensional portals and control shadow beasts such as the Uraotoko (裏男 "reversed man"). To prevent the Reikai from sending Sensui's soul to hell after the detective's death, Itsuki takes his body into the dimensional void, sealing them away for eternity where they can finally be alone together, in peace. 


* '''Minoru Kamiya''' (神谷実 ''Kamiya Minoru''), a.k.a. Doctor - Kamiya is the oldest human in Sensui's seven. He is able to produce poisonous Makai bugs that disease the people they bite. If Kamiya isn't beaten or killed within a half-hour, those infected will die. He's able to use his fingers as a scalpel, can reattach parts of his body, and has lost all sense of pain. He has also used his skills as a doctor to accelerate the flow of [[endorphin|endorphins]] in his body to give himself near-superhuman physical ability, and has altered the chemicals in his brain to make himself impossible to knock unconscious. After he was defeated by Yusuke and revived by Genkai he was taken into police custody, but later escaped. Afterwards he altered his face and began to use his medical skills to run a plastic surgery clinic.


* '''Sadao Makihara''' (巻原定男 ''Makihara Sadao''), a.k.a. Gourmet - He is able to eat the flesh of others and absorb their power.  When we first meet Sensui we saw Elder Toguro's head in a fish tank. Later he was eaten by Makihara. Later, Toguro overpowered Makihara and took control of his body and mind. Kurama later pulled off (Uncut): The top half of his head, (Edited CN version): His whole head. Kurama then reveals that Elder Toguro was controlling Gourmet and tells him to come on out. The rest goes under the Elder Toguro category.


* '''Kiyoshi Mitarai''' (御手洗清志 ''Mitarai Kiyoshi''), a.k.a. Sea Man - Mitarai is a young student who was always teased and tormented in school, causing him become misanthropic, making it easy for Sensui to coerce him.  He is able to control water that has been tinged with his own blood. He uses this ability to creates indestructible water creatures.   Mitarai later battles Kuwabara, who severely injures him after Kuwabara forms his Dimension Blade and cuts Mitarai and his territory. After Kuwabara helped save his life, and with some convincing, Mitarai decided to help the group. He leads Yusuke and the others to Sensui's hideout after Sensui kidnaps Kuwabara. After the battle against Sensui, Mitarai is accepted into a school of his choice.
