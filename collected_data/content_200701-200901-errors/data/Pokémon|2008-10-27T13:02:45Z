{{nihongo|'''''Pokémon'''''|ポケモン|Pokemon|extra={{IPAEng|ˈpoʊkeɪmɒn, ˈpɒkimɒn}}}} is a [[media franchise]] owned by the [[video game]] company [[Nintendo]] and created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]] around 1995. Originally released as a pair of interlinkable [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] [[Console role-playing game|role-playing]] [[video game]]s, ''Pokémon'' has since become the second most successful and lucrative video game-based media franchise in the world, behind only Nintendo's own ''[[Mario]]'' series.<ref name="UK paper names top game franchises ">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6164012.html |title=UK paper names top game franchises |accessdate=2007-02-26|last=Boyes |first=Emma |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2007-01-10 |year= |month= |format= |work=GameSpot |publisher=GameSpot UK |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=}}</ref> Pokémon properties have since been [[Merchandising|merchandised]] into [[anime]], [[manga]], [[Collectible card game|trading cards]], toys, books and other media. The franchise celebrated [[Pokémon: Tenth Anniversary|its tenth anniversary]] on February 27, 2006, and as of April 23, 2008, cumulative sales of the video games (including home console versions, such as the "Pikachu" [[Nintendo 64]]) have reached more than 180 million copies.<ref name="pokemon">{{cite press release |url=http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/9NH7dkYdedNEp7fwhDrI2NSqsKPVna6B |title=Fans Can Actually Become a Pokémon with Two New Nintendo DS Games |accessdate=2008-04-25 |date=2008-04-23 | publisher=[[Nintendo]]}}</ref>

The name ''Pokémon'' is the  [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of the Japanese brand, {{nihongo|"Pocket Monsters" |'''ポケ'''ット'''モン'''スター|'''Poke'''tto '''Mon'''sutā}},<ref name="The Pokemon Series Pokedex @ Gaming Target">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=6531 |title=The Pokemon Series Pokedex @ Gaming Target |accessdate=2007-02-28 |last=Swider |first=Matt |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work=Gaming Target |publisher=Gaming Target |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=}}</ref> as such contractions are very common in Japan. The term "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the ''Pokémon'' franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 493 [[List of Pokémon|fictional species]] that have made appearances in ''Pokémon'' media as of the recent release of the newest ''Pokémon'' role-playing games (RPGs) for the [[Nintendo DS]], [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (video games)|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]. Like the words [[deer]] and [[sheep]], the singular and plural forms of the word "Pokémon" do not differ, nor does each individual species name; in short, it is grammatically correct to say both "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon". In November 2005, [[4Kids Entertainment]], which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pokémon representation agreement. [[Pokémon USA]] Inc., a subsidiary of Japan's Pokémon Co., now oversees all Pokémon licensing outside of Asia.<ref>"[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7615 Pokemon USA Moves Licensing In-House]", ''Gamasutra''.</ref>

==Collecting and playing==
The concept of the ''Pokémon'' universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of ''Pokémon'', stems from the hobby of [[insect collecting]], a popular pastime which ''Pokémon'' executive director Satoshi Tajiri-Oniwa had enjoyed as a child.<ref>"{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html |title=The Ultimate Game Freak: Interview with Satoshi Tajiri |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050314021722/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html |archivedate=2005-03-14}}", ''TimeAsia'' ([[Waybacked]]).</ref> Players of the games are designated as [[Pokémon Trainer]]s, and the two general goals (in most ''Pokémon'' games) for such Trainers are: to complete the [[Pokédex]] by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where that game takes place; and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers, and eventually become the strongest Trainer, the Pokémon Master. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the ''Pokémon'' franchise, including the [[Pokémon video game series|video games]], the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]] and manga series, and the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]].

In most incarnations of the fictional ''Pokémon'' universe, a Trainer that encounters a wild Pokémon is able to capture that Pokémon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible tool called a [[Poké Ball]] at it. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the Poké Ball, that Pokémon is officially considered under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterward, it will obey whatever commands its new master issues to it from that point onward, unless the Trainer demonstrates enough of a lack of experience that the Pokémon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokémon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokémon; if the opposing Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokémon with a Poké Ball, increasing his or her collection of creatures. (Pokémon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain games.) If a Pokémon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (i.e., "faints"), the winning Pokémon gains experience and may [[level up]]. When leveling up, the Pokémon's statistics ("[[Pokémon game mechanics|stats]]") of battling aptitude increase, including Attack, Speed, and so on. From time to time the Pokémon may also learn new [[Pokémon move|moves]], which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pokémon possess the ability to undergo a form of [[metamorphosis]] and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pokémon, a process called [[Pokémon evolution|evolution]].

In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many [[non-player character]] (NPC) Trainers and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the Pokémon world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way. Each game features eight especially powerful Trainers, referred to as Gym Leaders, that the Trainer must each defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, that Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pokémon League, where four immensely talented trainers (referred to collectively as the "Elite Four") challenge the Trainer to four Pokémon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, he or she must then challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion and gains the title of Pokémon Master.

===Generations===
<!--Please don't delete/rename this header as it is linked to/from a number of places.-->The original Pokémon games were Japanese [[Console role-playing game|RPGs]] with an element of strategy, and were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the [[Game Boy]]. These role-playing games, and their sequels, remakes, and English language translations, are still considered the "main" Pokémon games, and the games which most fans of the series are referring to when they use the term "Pokémon games". All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by [[The Pokémon Company]] are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly [[chronological]] divisions by release; every several years, when an official sequel in the main RPG series is released that features new Pokémon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga and trading card game are all updated with the new Pokémon properties each time a new generation begins. The franchise is in its fourth generation.[[Image:Bulbasaur pokemon red.png|thumb|right|A level 5 [[Bulbasaur]] involved in a battle with a level 5 [[Charmander]] in [[Pokémon Red|''Pokémon Red and Blue'']].<ref> MacDonald, Mark; Brokaw, Brian; Arnold; J. Douglas; Elies, Mark. Pokémon Trainer's Guide. Sandwich Islands Publishing, 1999. ISBN 0-439-15404-9. (pg73)</ref>]]The Pokémon franchise started off in its first generation with its initial release of [[Pokémon Red and Blue#Pocket Monsters|''Pocket Monsters Aka'' and ''Midori'']] ("Red" and "Green", respectively) for the [[Game Boy]] in Japan. When these games proved extremely popular, an enhanced ''Ao'' ("Blue") version was released sometime after, and the ''Ao'' version was reprogrammed as [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] for international release. The games launched in the United States on September 30, 1998. The original ''Aka'' and ''Midori'' versions were never released outside of Japan.<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/data/924467.html "Pokémon Green Info on GameFAQs"] ''gamefaqs.com'' URL Accessed February 23, 2007</ref> Afterwards, a further enhanced remake titled ''[[Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition]]'' was released to partially take advantage of the color palette of the [[Game Boy Color]], as well as to feature more elements from the popular [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon anime]]. This first generation of games introduced the original 151 species of Pokémon (in [[List of Pokémon|National Pokédex]] order, encompassing all Pokémon from [[Bulbasaur]] to [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]]), as well as the basic game concepts of capturing, training, battling, and trading Pokémon with both computer and human players. These versions of the games take place within the fictional [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]] [[Pokémon regions|region]], though the name "Kanto" was not used until the second generation. The second generation of Pokémon began in 2000 with the release of [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] for [[Game Boy Color]]. Like the previous generation, an enhanced remake titled ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]'' was later released. The second generation introduced 100 new species of Pokémon (starting with [[Chikorita]] and ending with [[Celebi]]), for a total of 251 Pokémon to collect, train, and battle. The Pokémon mini was a [[handheld game console]] released in December 2001 in Japan and then later in 2002 in Europe and North America. ''Pokémon'' entered its third generation with the 2003 release of [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] for [[Game Boy Advance]] and continued with the Game Boy Advance remakes of ''Pokémon Red and Blue'', [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], and an enhanced remake of ''Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire'' titled '‘[[Pokémon Emerald]]’'. The third generation introduced 135 new Pokémon (starting with [[Treecko]] and ending with [[Deoxys]]) for a total of 386 species. However, this generation also garnered some criticism for leaving out several gameplay features, including the day-and-night system introduced in the previous generation, and it was also the first installment that encouraged the player to collect merely a selected assortment of the total number of Pokémon rather than every existing species (202 out of 386 species are catchable in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' versions). In 2006, Japan began the fourth generation of the franchise with the release of [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (video games)|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] for Nintendo DS. The fourth generation introduces another 107 new species of Pokémon (starting with [[Turtwig]] and ending with [[Arceus]]), bringing the total of Pokémon species to 493.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.ds.ign.com/articles/778/778464p1.html |title=The Countdown to Diamond and Pearl, Part 4|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Lucas M. Thomas|date=April 4, 2007|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> The [[Nintendo DS]] "touch screen" allows new features to the game such as cooking poffins with the stylus and using the "Pokétch". New gameplay concepts include a restructured [[Pokémon moves|move]]-classification system, online multiplayer trading and battling via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], the return (and expansion) of the second generation's day-and-night system, the expansion of the third generation's Pokémon Contests into "Super Contests", and the new region of [[Sinnoh]], which has an underground component for multiplayer gameplay in addition to the main overworld. ''[[Pokémon Platinum]]'' has also been confirmed, the enhanced remake of Diamond and Pearl, much like Pokémon Yellow, Crystal, and Emerald, and it has new features. Spin-off titles in the fourth generation include the ''Pokémon Stadium'' follow-up ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]'' for [[Wii]], which has Wi-Fi connectivity as well.<ref>"[http://www.cubed3.com/news/5349 Cubed3 Pokémon Battle Revolution Confirmed for Wii]" and soon Pokémon Mistery Dungeon 2: Darkness Exploration Team, and Time Exploration Team ''Cubed3.com''.

===Game mechanics===
{{main|Pokémon game mechanics}}

====Starter Pokémon====
{{main|Pokémon game mechanics#Starter Pokémon|l1=Starter Pokémon}}
One of the consistent aspects of the [[Pokémon video games|''Pokémon'' games]] &mdash; spanning from [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] on the [[Game Boy line|Nintendo Game Boy]] to the [[Nintendo DS]] game, [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (video games)|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] &mdash; is the choice of one of three different Pokémon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labeled "starter Pokémon". Players can choose a [[Pokémon type#Grass-type|Grass-type]], a [[Pokémon type#Fire-type|Fire-type]], or a [[Pokémon type#Water-type|Water-type]].<ref name=spy> [http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html ''Pokémon Ruby'' review (page 1)] ''Gamespy.com''. URL Accessed May 30, 2006.</ref> For example, in ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' (and their respective reworks, ''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''Pokémon LeafGreen''), the player has the choice of starting with [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], or [[Squirtle]]. The exception to this rule is ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'' (a remake of the original games that follows the story of the ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon anime]]''), where players are given a [[Pikachu]], an [[Pokémon type#Electric-type|Electric-type]] mouse Pokémon, famous for being the mascot of the Pokémon media franchise; in this game, however, the three starter Pokémon from ''Red'' and ''Blue'' can be obtained during the quest by a single player, something that is not possible in any other installment of the franchise.<ref>[http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162045p1.html ''Pokémon Yellow'' Critical Review] ''Ign.com''. URL accessed on March 27, 2006.</ref> Another consistent aspect is that the player's rival will always choose as his or her starter Pokémon the one that has a type advantage over the player's Pokémon. For instance, if the player picks a Grass-type Pokémon, the rival will always pick the fire-type starter. Of course, the exception to this is again ''Pokémon Yellow'', in which the rival picks an [[Eevee]], but whether this Eevee evolves into [[Jolteon]], [[Vaporeon]] or [[Flareon]] is decided by when the player wins and loses to the rival through the journey.

====Pokédex====
{{Main|Pokédex}}
The [[Pokédex]] is a fictional electronic device featured in the ''Pokémon'' [[video game]] and [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]] series. In the games, whenever a Pokémon is first captured, its data will be added to a player's Pokédex, but in the anime or [[Pokémon Adventures|manga]], the Pokédex is a comprehensive electronic reference encyclopedia, usually referred to in order to deliver [[Exposition (plot device)|exposition]]. "[[Pokédex]]" is also used to refer to a list of Pokémon, usually a list of Pokémon by number. In the video games, a [[Pokémon Trainer]] is issued a blank device at the start of their journey. A trainer must then attempt to fill the Pokédex by encountering and at least briefly obtaining each of the different species of Pokémon. A player will receive the name and image of a Pokémon after encountering one that was not previously in the Pokédex, typically after battling said Pokémon either in the wild or in a trainer battle (with the exceptions of link battles and tournament battles, such as in the [[Pokémon Emerald#Battle Frontier|Battle Frontier]]). In ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'', some Pokémon's data is added to the Pokédex simply by viewing the Pokémon, such as in the zoo outside of the Safari Zone. Also, certain NPC characters may add to the Pokédex by explaining what a Pokémon looks like during conversation. More detailed information is available after the player obtains a member of the species, either through capturing the Pokémon in the wild, evolving a previously captured Pokémon, hatching a Pokémon egg (from the second generation onwards), or through a trade with another trainer (either an NPC or another player). This information includes height, weight, species type, and a short description of the Pokémon. Later versions of the Pokédex have more detailed information, like the size of a certain Pokémon compared to the player character, or Pokémon being sorted by their habitat (so far, the latter feature is only in the ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''  versions).The most current forms of Pokédex are capable of containing information on all Pokémon currently known. The [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] games, ''[[Pokémon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]]'', have a Pokémon Digital Assistant (P{{Unicode|★}}DA) which is similar to the Pokédex, but also tells what types are effective against a Pokémon and gives a description of its abilities.<ref>Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p. 30-31</ref>

==In other media==
===Anime series===
{{Main|Pokémon (anime)}}
[[Image:Pokémon episode 1 screenshot.png|thumb|250px|left|Ash Ketchum and Pikachu together in the pilot episode, [[Pokémon, I Choose You!]] ]]The ''Pokémon'' anime [[Television program|series]] and [[film]]s are a meta-series of adventures separate from the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] that most of the ''Pokémon'' video games follow (with the exception of ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'', a game based on the anime storyline). The anime follows the quest of the main character, [[Ash Ketchum]]<ref name=ash> [http://www.psypokes.com/anime/index.php ''Pokémon'' anime overview] ''Psypokes.com''. URL Accessed May 25, 2006.</ref> (known as Satoshi in Japan) a Pokémon Master in training, as he and a small group of friends<ref name=ash/> travel around the fictitious world of Pokémon along with their Pokémon partners. The original series, titled ''Pocket Monsters'', or simply ''Pokémon'' in western countries (often referred to as ''Pokémon: Gotta Catch 'Em All'' to distinguish it from the later series), begins with Ash's first day as a Pokémon trainer. His first (and signature) Pokémon is a [[Pikachu]], differing from the games, where only [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], or [[Squirtle]] could be chosen.<ref> ''Pokémon 10th Anniversary, Vol. 1 - Pikachu'', Viz Video., June 6, 2006. {{ASIN|B000F4PDE4}}.</ref>  The series follows the storyline of the original games, [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']], in the region of [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]]. Accompanying Ash on his journeys are [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]], the [[List of Kanto locations#Pewter City|Pewter City]] Gym Leader, and [[Misty (Pokémon)|Misty]], the youngest of the Gym Leader sisters from [[List of Kanto locations#Cerulean City|Cerulean City]]. ''Pokémon: Adventures in the Orange Islands'' follows Ash's adventures in the Orange Islands, a place unique to the anime, and replaces Brock with [[Tracey Sketchit]], an artist and "Pokémon watcher". The next series, based on the second generation of games, include ''Pokémon: Johto Journeys'', ''Pokémon: Johto League Champions'', and ''Pokémon: Master Quest'', following the original trio of Ash, Brock, and Misty in the western [[Johto]] region. The saga continues in ''[[Pokémon: Advanced Battle]]'', based on the third generation games. Ash and company travel to [[Hoenn]], a southern region in the Pokémon World. Ash takes on the role of a teacher and mentor for a novice Pokémon trainer named [[May (Pokémon)|May]]. Her brother [[Max (Pokémon)|Max]] accompanies them, and though he isn't a trainer, he knows large amounts of handy information. Brock (from the original series) soon catches up with Ash, but Misty has returned to Cerulean City to tend to her duties as a gym leader. (Misty, along with other recurring characters, appears in the spin-off series ''[[Pokémon Chronicles]]''.) The Advanced Battle series concludes with the ''Battle Frontier'' saga, based on the ''Emerald'' version and including aspects of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''. The most recent series is the ''Diamond and Pearl'' series, with Max leaving to pick his starter Pokémon, and May going to the Grand Festival in Johto. Ash, Brock, and a new companion named [[Dawn (Pokémon)|Dawn]] travel through the region of [[Sinnoh]]. In addition to the TV series, eleven [[Pokémon (anime)#Pokémon films|Pokémon films]] have been made, with a twelfth to be released in Japan in July 2008. Collective bonuses, such as promotional trading cards, have been available with some of the films.

<!-- THE SEIZURES WERE CAUSED BY '''FLASHING''' COLORS, STILLS WILL NOT BLIND PEOPLE!-->{{main|Banned episodes of Pokémon#Dennō Senshi Porygon|l1=Banned episodes of Pokémon}}
On December 16, 1997, more than 635 Japanese children were admitted to hospitals with [[epileptic seizure]]s. It was determined that the seizures were caused by watching an episode of Pokémon, "''[[Banned episodes of Pokémon#Dennō Senshi Porygon|Dennō Senshi Porygon]]''", (most commonly translated "Electric Soldier Porygon", season 1, episode 38); as a result, this episode has not been aired since. In this particular episode, there were bright explosions with rapidly-alternating blue and red color patterns.<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/pokemon.html Pokemon packs a punch] URL accessed January 7, 2007.</ref> It was determined in subsequent research that these strobing light effects cause some individuals to have epileptic seizures, even if the person had no previous history of [[epilepsy]].<ref>"{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/06/990601080722.htm |title=Color Changes in TV Cartoons Cause Seizures |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041108175456/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/06/990601080722.htm |archivedate=2004-11-08}}", ''ScienceDaily'' ([[Waybacked]]).</ref> This incident is the most common focus of Pokémon-related parodies in other media, and was lampooned by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF20|title=Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo|publisher=The Simpsons Archive|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> and the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Chinpokomon]]",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://209.85.173.104/search?q=cache:wZfySARP7DMJ:www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/FileGet.cfm%3FID%3D1cff12f4-03a2-4126-b886-16b7669da213+south+park+pokemon+parody&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=6&gl=us&client=firefox-a |title=South Park Goes Global: Reading Japan in Pokemon |publisher=[[University of Auckland]] |accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> among others.

===Monster in My Pocket===
In March 2000, Morrison Entertainment Group, a small toy developer based at [[Manhattan Beach, California]], sued Nintendo over claims that Pokémon infringed on its own "[[Monster in My Pocket]]" characters. A judge ruled that there was no infringement, so Morrison appealed the ruling in November 2001.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bronstad|first=Amanda|title=Toy Firm Will Appeal 'Pocket Monster' Suit|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_46_23/ai_80165415|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071015132351/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_46_23/ai_80165415|archivedate=2007-10-15|work=Los Angeles Business Journal|publisher=FindArticles.com|date=2001-11-12|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

==Cultural influence==
[[Image:ana.b747.pokemon.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|200|[[All Nippon Airways]] [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-400]] in Pokémon livery.]]''Pokémon'', being a popular franchise, has undoubtedly left its mark on [[pop-culture]]. The ''Pokémon'' characters themselves have become pop-culture icons; examples include two different [[Pikachu]] balloons in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], a [[:Image:ana.b747.pokemon.arp.750pix.jpg|Pokémon-styled]] [[Boeing 747-400]], thousands of merchandise items, and a [[Poképark|theme park]] in [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya, Japan]] in 2005 and [[Taipei]] in 2006. Pokémon also appeared on the cover of the U.S. magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1999. The Comedy Central show ''[[Drawn Together]]'' has a character named [[Ling-Ling]] which is a direct parody of Pikachu.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://trsrockin.com/ripoffs.html|title=Pokemon Rip-offs|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> Several other shows such as ''[[ReBoot]]'', ''[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo|The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Chinpokomon|South Park]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' have made references and spoofs of ''Pokémon'', among other series. Pokémon was also featured on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the '90s: Part Deux]]''. A live action show called ''[[Pokémon Live!]]'' toured the United States in late 2000. It was based on the popular [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon anime]], but had some continuity errors relating to it.


In November 2001, Nintendo opened a store called the Pokémon Center in New York, in New York's [[Rockefeller Center]],<ref>http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y01/m11/i19/s03 Opening Date of Store</ref> modeled after the two other Pokémon Center stores in Tokyo and [[Osaka]], fictional buildings where Trainers take their Pokémon to be healed.<ref>http://www.pokezam.com/pokemon/pokecenterny/ Information on the Store</ref> The store sold Pokémon merchandise on a total of two floors, with items ranging from collectible shirts to stuffed Pokémon [[plushies]].<ref>http://www.bigapplevisitorscenter.com/kids.htm Tour Site Page</ref> The store also featured a ''Pokémon Distributing Machine'' in which players would place their game to receive an egg of a Pokémon that is being given out at that time. The store also had tables that were open for players of the [[Pokémon Card Game]] to duel each other or an employee. The store was closed and replaced by the [[Nintendo World Store]] on May 14, 2005.<ref>http://ml.wisdomdigital.com/listingsinfo.cfm?id=62&table=Shopping&lid=7&cat=19 Manhattan Living Page On Store</ref>
