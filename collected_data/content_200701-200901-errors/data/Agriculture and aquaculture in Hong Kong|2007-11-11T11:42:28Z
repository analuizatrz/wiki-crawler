'''Agriculture and Aquaculture in Hong Kong''' are considered [[Sunset Industry|sunset industries]]. Most agricultural produce is directly imported from the neighbouring [[mainland China]]. In 2006 the industry accounts for less than 0.3% of the labor sector.<ref>Hong Kong census. "[http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_800/labour.pdf Census labour data pdf]." ''Labour.''

==History==
[[Image:Old Office of Dairy Farm International Holdings.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Old office of [[Dairy Farm International Holdings|Hong Kong Dairy Farm]]]] 

In the [[Colonial Hong Kong]] era around 1850s, agriculture in Hong Kong consisted mostly of [[Revenue Farm|revenue farm]]s that focused on [[opium]] productions. The industry led to many wealthy Chinese businessmen, who established themselves as the middlemen merchants with international connection. Some of the successful farmers included Yan Wo Hong and Wo Hang Hong from 1858 to 1887.<ref>Ngo, Tak-Wing. [1999] (1999). Hong Kong's History: State and Society Under Colonial Rule. United Kingdom: Routledge. ISBN 0415203058.</ref> The system was discontinued by colonial authorities, when the economy needed to diversify in other activities. The last opium farm ended in 1913.<ref>Dahles, Heidi. Muijzenber, Otto van den. [2003] (2003) Capital and Knowledge in Asia: Changing Power Relations. Routledge. ISBN 0415304172.</ref> One of the farm founded in the era include [[Dairy Farm International Holdings|Hong Kong Dairy Farm]] in 1886. As [[Hong Kong government]] favor the transition into a [[Secondary sector of industry|secondary sector]], and eventually a [[Tertiary sector of industry|tertiary sector]], agriculture became a reduced segment.

[[Organic Farming]] was introduced in 1988.<ref name="OrFarm">Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. "[http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/agriculture/agr_orgfarm/agr_orgfarm.html Organic Farming]." ''Organic Farming in Hong Kong.'' Retrieved on [[2007-03-20]].</ref> An Accredited Farm Scheme for protecting the environment and consumers against residues of agricultural [[pesticide]]s was introduced in 1994. Accredited farms strictly monitor and supervise the uses of pesticides, and produce are further analyzed for chemical remnants before they are sold at accredited retail outlets. In 1994 the agriculture and fisheries industry represented 2.7% of the work force and just a mere 0.2% of the total GDP.<ref name="Genzberger">Genzberger. Christine A. [1994] (1994).

==Consumption==
Statistically, Hong Kong can only produce enough for 20% of the local population without depending on mainland imports.<ref name="Genzberger" /> In the [[1990s in Hong Kong|mid-1990s]], 50% of Hong Kong's water resources were still purchased from the mainland.<ref name="Genzberger" /> Hong Kong have always depended heavily on imports. The dependency on imports has increased steadily, since the ratio of population growth far exceed agricultural production numbers. In 2007, Hong Kong’s population of almost 7 million<ref>HK Census.

==Resources==
===Agriculture===
In 2006 there are 2,100 farms in the territory, employing directly about 5,300 farmers and workers.<ref name="HKagrgov">Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. "[http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/agriculture/agr_hk/agr_hk.html HK gov]." ''Agriculture in HK.'' Retrieved on [[2007-03-20]].</ref> By the end of 2005, the land used for vegetable, flower, field crop, and [[orchard]] are 330 [[Hectare|ha]], 190 ha, 30 ha, and 290 ha respectively.<ref name="HKagrgov" />

===Fishing===
Hong Kong’s fishing activities are conducted mainly in the waters of the adjacent continental shelf in the [[South China Sea|South]] and [[East China Sea]]s. They extend over a 160 [[kilometre]] wide section of this shelf between the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] and the East China Sea. The majority of the [[fishing vessel]]s are manned by family members with the assistance of hired crew. Main fishing methods include [[trawling]], [[long-lining]], [[Gillnet|gill-netting]] and [[Seine (fishing)|purse-seining]] with the majority of the total catch obtained through trawling.<ref name="HKfishgov">Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. " [http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/fish_cap/fish_cap_latest/fish_cap_latest.html HK gov]." ''Fisheries latest.'' Retrieved on [[2007-04-03]].</ref>  The industry now consists of some 4,150 [[fishing vessel]]s and some 9,200 [[fishermen]] working abroad and provides employment in ancillary sectors servicing the fishing industry, such as fish wholesale and retail marketing, fuel and fishing gear supply and ice manufacturing<ref name="HKfishgov" />

==Local production==
Agriculture industry produced HK$1,180 million worth of produce in 2005. It comprises HK$264 million of crop production, HK$554 million of livestock production and KH$360 million of poultry production.<ref name="HKagrgov" /> The average daily production of vegetable, live chicken and live pigs are 67 tonnes, 32,000 birds and 1,030 heads respectively. In 2005, local production accounted for 4% of fresh vegetables, 52% of live poultry and 18% of live pigs consumed in the territory.<ref name="HKagrgov" />

Aquaculture includes marine fish culture, pond fish culture and oyster culture. In 2005 production from the aquaculture sector was 3,725 tonnes valued at HK$120 million which was 2.2 per cent in weight and 6.7 per cent in value of the total fisheries production.<ref name="HKfishmpo">Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. " [http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/fish_aqu/fish_aqu_mpo/fish_aqu_mpo.html HK gov]." ''Fisheries mpo.'' Retrieved on [[2007-04-03]].</ref>  

==Principal crops==
[[Image:Punti_farmers.jpg|thumb|400px|Two [[Punti]] farmers taking care of their field.]]

The value of crop production amounted to $272 million in 2003. [[Vegetable]] and [[flower]] production account for about 97 % of the total value, being $264 million in 2003. Vegetable crops grown all year round include white [[cabbage]], flowering cabbage, [[lettuce]], [[Chinese kale]], [[radish]], leaf [[Mustard plant|mustard]], [[spring onion]] and [[chive]]. [[Spinach]], [[watercress]], and [[matrimony vine]] are produced in the cooler months. [[Yardlong bean]]s, [[water spinach]], [[amaranth]], [[cucumber]], and several species of Chinese [[gourd]] are produced in summer. A wide range of temperate vegetables including [[tomato]], [[sweet pepper]], [[cauliflower]], [[carrot]], and [[celery]] are grown in [[winter]].

Flower cultivation has gained importance in recent years. [[Gladiolus]], [[lily]], and [[chrysanthemum]] are grown in winter; and [[ginger lily]] and [[lotus (genus)|lotus]] flower in summer. [[Peach]] blossom is grown especially for the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]]. A wide range of fruit is grown on the lower hill slopes, the main types being [[lychee]], [[longan]], [[wampei]], local [[lemon]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tangerine]], [[guava]], [[papaya]] and [[banana]].

==Animal husbandry==
There were 281 local pig farms and 205 local poultry farms in 2004. During 2003, local pig production was valued at $527 million and local poultry production, including [[pigeons]] and [[egg (biology)|eggs]] was valued at $250 million. Pigs raised on local farms are crosses derived from Duroc, [[Landrace]] and Large White parent stock. The majority of local [[chicken]]s raised on farms are Shek Ki cross bred chickens. Recently, brand name chickens like Ka Mei chickens and Tai On chickens have been introduced to local market by local investors. There are two [[dairy|dairies]] in active operation with a total herd population of less than 50 cows.

==Aquaculture and Fishing==
[[Image:FishScheme.jpg|thumb|right|Accredited Fish Farm Scheme Logo]]
The commercially important marine species are [[bigeye]], [[golden thread]], [[croaker]], [[horse-head]] and [[pomfret]]. The total capture fisheries and marine fish culture production is equivalent to about 31% of [[seafood]] consumed in Hong Kong, while pond fish farmers produce about 6% of the [[freshwater]] fish eaten.  The majority of fish farms in [[New Territories]] are engaged in [[carp]] [[polyculture]] ([[Bighead Carp|bighead carp]], [[Silver Carp|silver carp]], [[Common Carp|common carp]] and [[grass carp]]) in combination with [[tilapia]] or grey [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]] as the major species. Other cultured species include [[seabreams]] and [[spotted scat]]. At present there are 26 fish culture zones designated under the ''"Marine Fish Culture Ordinance"''. Common species cultured include green [[grouper]], brownspotted grouper, Russell’s [[snapper]], mangrove snapper, [[cobia]] and [[pampano]].  The voluntary "Accredited Fish Farm Scheme" has been launched to assist local fish farmers.<ref name="HKfishaqu" />

==Agricultural development==
The [[Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department]] (AFCD) and its closely related marketing organisations provide infrastructural support and technical services to the various [[primary industries]]. The department’s crop specialists undertake studies into practical problems in pest control, crop husbandry and soil management. They also investigate specific production technologies to enhance the efficiency and economic benefits of the industry. This work is carried out in an experimental station in [[Sheung Shui]] and results are made available to farmers by the department’s advisory service. 

[[Image:Kadoorie farm agriculture.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Farm in Hong Kong]]

Agricultural advisory activities are aimed at assisting farmers to improve productivity through the introduction of new and improved produce varieties and production techniques, backed up by adequate credit facilities and efficient and orderly marketing services. Studies are currently under way to adapt and develop greenhouse and organic production technology for local farms. Examples of well-received new produce varieties are: supersweet [[maize]], heat tolerant lettuce, coloured [[sweet pepper]], [[spaghetti squash]], [[strawberry]] and white bitter cucumber. 

Loans issued to farmers in 2003 amounted to $19 million and the total value of loans issued up to December 31, 2003 (under three separate loan funds administered by AFCD) was $505 million. These loans are granted to cover farm production and development purposes.
