'''Klaas Jan Huntelaar''' (born [[August 12]], [[1983]] in [[Drempt]], [[Gelderland]], [[Netherlands]]) is a Dutch [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who plays as a [[striker]] for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. He is seen as a rising star in Dutch football, having scored 33 goals in the [[Eredivisie 2005/2006|2005/06 Eredivisie campaign]], making him top goalscorer. His nickname is 'The Hunter' and he has already been compared to the legendary [[Marco van Basten]] who is now the current coach of the Dutch national team.

==Club career==
===PSV===
In 2000, aged 16, Huntelaar joined PSV Eindhoven’s academy and established himself as a prolific goalscorer for their youth team. He made his debut for PSV during the first half of the 2002-2003 season on [[November 23]], [[2002]] in a 0-3 away win over [[RBC Roosendaal]]. This was however his one and only [[Eredivisie]] appearance for the club.

===De Graafschap / AGOVV===
Having failed to establish himself in the first team he was sent on loan to [[De Graafschap]] to gain experience. He made nine Eredivisie appearances for ‘the Super Farmers’ but failed to score. In the summer of 2003 Huntelaar was again sent on loan. This time to [[Eerste Divisie]] side [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]]. He was an instant success scoring 26 times in his 35 league appearances and finished the season as the divisions top goalscorer.

===SC Heerenveen===
After he turned down the opportunity to sign a new contract with PSV, [[Friesland|Frysian]] club [[SC Heerenveen]] moved in to sign him for a transfer fee of €100,000. The following season he scored 17 goals in 31 matches to help Heerenveen qualify for the [[UEFA Cup]]. 2005/06 saw him score 17 goals in 15 matches, which earned him a mid-season transfer to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], who paid € 9 million + future incentives for the player.<ref>{{cite web | title= Transfer completed: Huntelaar to join Ajax for 4.5 years | publisher=Ajax USA | url=http://www.ajax-usa.com/news/2005-2006/transfer-completed-huntelaar-to-join-ajax-for-4-5-years.html | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> A substantial sum went to rivals [[PSV Eindhoven]] as a result of the training compensation rule imposed by [[FIFA]].

===Ajax===
====2005/2006====
[[Image:Huntelaar Trophy.jpg|thumb|130px|Celebrating victory in the [[KNVB Cup|Dutch Cup]] with Ajax]]
Upon transferring during the winter break from Heerenveen, Huntelaar struggled in his first month with Ajax. It was only in February, in his fifth match for Ajax, that he scored his first goal in a Gatorade Cup tie against his old club Heerenveen.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax naar halve finale Gatorade Cup door zege op Heerenveen | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/2299.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> Once he had broken his spell of scoring drought, Huntelaar started scoring regularly. During the month of February, Huntelaar scored 9 goals in 7 matches for Ajax, including a header against [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] on his Champions League debut.<ref>{{cite web | title= Inter recovery pegs back Ajax | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/FixturesResults/Round=2202/match=1102853/Report=RP.html | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> Huntelaar continued his prolific goal scoring for the rest of the season, and at the end was the top scorer of the Dutch league, having scored sixteen goals in the same number of appearances for Ajax, bringing his total for the season at 33 goals in 31 matches.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Huntelaar evenaart topscorer Cruijff | publisher=KNVB | url=http://www.knvb.nl/archief/clubs/knvb.nl_clubs__competities/huntelaar_evenaart_topscorer_cruijff | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref>

Since Ajax had finished second in the Dutch league, they would have to play in the European play-offs to secure a place in the third round of the Champions League. In the semis, Ajax faced their rivals Feyenoord, who had finished fourth in the league. In the first leg in the [[Amsterdam Arena]], Ajax crushed Feyenoord 3-0, with Huntelaar scoring the final goal for Ajax.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax in Arena ruim langs Feyenoord | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/2747.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> In the second leg, Ajax further humbled Feyenoord by beating them 2-4 in [[De Kuip]]. Huntelaar was once again on target, scoring the 0-2 for Ajax.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax bezorgt Feyenoord de ultieme vernedering | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/2764.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> Huntelaar featured in the defeat of [[FC Groningen]] in the final two games of the play-offs to secure Ajax Champions League football for next season, although he did not score.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax plaatst zich in slotfase voor voorronde Champions League | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/2849.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref>

Huntelaar scored a spectacular [[bicycle kick]] during the injury time of the [[KNVB Cup]] semi-final against [[Roda JC]], which squared the match 1-1. Ajax went on to win the game after extra time 4-1 with Huntelaar scoring another goal in the 109th minute to take them to the final of the Dutch cup, where Ajax would face rivals [[PSV Eindhoven]].<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax naar bekerfinale na zinderend duel tegen Roda | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/2564.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> In the final, Huntelaar went on to score a brace, including the winner, to bring Ajax its 16th KNVB Cup.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Huntelaar bezorgt Ajax met twee doelpunten de beker | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/2882.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref>

====2006/2007====
Huntelaar was the first player to score a goal at [[Arsenal F.C.]]'s new [[Emirates Stadium]] in a testimonial match for [[Dennis Bergkamp]] on [[July 22]], [[2006]] - a match Ajax ended up losing 2-1 (although in the second half, which started off with Ajax leading 1-0, 'legends' like [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Ian Wright]] played instead).<ref>{{cite web | title= Bergkamp given rousing farewell | publisher=BBC Sport | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/5203954.stm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref>

[[Image:Ajax training april-mei 2006 (80).JPG|thumb|130px|Huntelaar in training with Ajax]]
Huntelaar started the 2006/07 European campaign well by scoring a brace against Copenhagen in the first leg of the [[UEFA Champions League]] 3rd qualifying round.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax verslaat FC Kopenhagen dankzij Huntelaar | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/3354.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> However, a shock 2-0 defeat away in Copenhagen meant that Ajax were demoted to the [[UEFA Cup]], in which Huntelaar scored 8 goals out of 7 matches played.

In the Dutch league, Huntelaar continued scoring this season, getting 21 goals in the league as Ajax once again finished second. In the KNVB Cup, Huntelaar scored four goals in six matches, including a goal in the final against AZ that Ajax went on to win.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= AJAX WINT BEKER NA SLIJTAGESLAG VAN 120 MINUTEN | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/4996.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref>

Finishing second in the league meant that Ajax once again had to play in the European play-offs to secure Champions League football for the next season. Huntelaar scored two goals in the second leg of the semi-final against his old club Heerenveen as Ajax went on to win 4-1 on aggregate.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax boekt ruime overwinning op Heerenveen | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/5068.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> In the final [[Louis van Gaal]]'s AZ awaited Ajax. Huntelaar featured in both legs as Ajax went on to win 4-2 on aggregate to secure a place in the third qualifying round of the Champions League.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Ajax wint play-offs na goede zege op AZ | publisher=Ajax Online | url=http://www.ajaxonline.org/5187.htm | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref>

====2007/2008====
The 2007/08 season started with mixed performances. Huntelaar featured in Ajax's third consecutive victory in the [[Johan Cruijff-schaal]] in a 1-0 win over PSV Eindhoven.<ref>{{cite web | title= Gabri clinches Super Cup for Ajax | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=569819.html | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref> Next followed the third round Champions League qualifier match against [[SK Slavia Praha]]. Huntelaar missed a penalty as Ajax went on to lose 0-1 in the first leg in the Amsterdam Arena, and a repeat of the shock exit in the 2006 Champions League took place after Ajax also lost the second leg in Prague 2-1.<ref>{{cite web | title= Slavia make Ajax pay the penalty | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/fixturesresults/round=15104/match=301260/report=rp.html | accessdate=2007-08-23 }}</ref>

In the first Eredivisie match of the season Huntelaar scored four goals to help them past newly promoted De Graafschap in an 1-8 away victory.<ref>{{cite web | title= Timely boost for four-goal Huntelaar | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=573067.html | accessdate=2007-08-20 }}</ref>

==International career==
Despite being in the preliminary squad, Huntelaar was not chosen for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Coach [[Marco van Basten]] explained that he felt Huntelaar would benefit from more experience and from playing at the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2006|UEFA Under 21&nbsp;football championships]], going as far as to say that it was up to Huntelaar to "show us there that by not selecting Huntelaar we did not do the right thing".<ref>{{nl}} [http://www.voetbalonline.nl/ecNewsitem.asp?id=46667 Huntelaar en Castelen niet naar Duitsland], voetbalonline.nl</ref> While Holland went on to score no goals against quality opposition at the World Cup in Germany, Huntelaar led the Dutch to victory as the top-scorer of the Under 21 tournament with four goals, including a wonderful strike in the semi-final against France and a brace in the final against Ukraine. Huntelaar was named in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21&nbsp;football Championship#Player awards|UEFA Team of the Tournament]] as a striker.

Marco van Basten decided to call Huntelaar as his starting striker in the Dutch National squad's friendly against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on August 16, 2006. Huntelaar paid immediate dividends by scoring two goals (another one was disallowed by a controversial off-side call by the referee, denying him the hat-trick), and making two assists, in Holland's 4-0 victory. However in his next seven caps he did not manage to add another goal. Huntelaar was not called up by Marco van Basten for the international friendly against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]].
