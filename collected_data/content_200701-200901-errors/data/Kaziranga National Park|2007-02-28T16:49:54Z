'''Kaziranga National Park''' ([[Assamese]]: কাজিৰাঙ্গা জাতীয় উদ্যান , Assamese [[IAST]]: kājirāṅgā jātiya udyāna, Assamese [[IPA]]: kɑ/ɟi/rɑŋ/gɑ, [[Indian English]] IPA: kɑ/zi/rɑŋ/gɑ) is a famous [[India|Indian]] [[national park of India|national park]] located on the south bank of the [[Brahmaputra]] river in the state of [[Assam]], [[India]]. It is a famous conservation area and tourist spot as it provides  a refuge for the endangered Indian or [[one-horned rhinoceros]] (''Rhinoceros unicornis''), being the largest population of wild Indian one-horned Rhinoceros in the world . Stretching over an area of 430 km², Kaziranga is a vast stretch of coarse, tall [[elephant grass]], [[marshland]] and dense [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]]. The Park celebrated its centenary in [[2005]].



==History==

===History of the park===
In the early years of the [[19th century]], the area around Kaziranga was not well settled, as it was notorious for wild animals, [[malaria]] and the floods and changing course of the [[Brahmaputra River]].  The forests in the area were slowly cleared for settlements and tea [[plantation]]s with the rise of the [[Assam Tea|tea industry]]. The local villagers practiced some [[slash and burn]] cultivation, while the [[British]] established small permanent colonies for tea cultivation. <ref name= "kazi100">[http://www.kaziranga100.com/Conservation%20Management.htm Kaziranga-History] Accessed on [[February 23]], [[2007]]</ref>

[[Image:Franz_von_Lenbach_Portrait_Lady_Curzon.jpg|thumb|Curzon's wife Mary Victoria Leiter who visited the park in 1904]]
The history of protection in Kaziranga dates back to the early [[20th century]], when Lady Curzon (originally [[Mary Victoria Leiter]]), first wife of [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], then [[Viceroy of India]] visited the Kaziranga area in 1904<ref>[http://www.kaziranga100.com Kaziranga] Accessed on February 23, 2007</ref>- known for its rhinoceros population but saw only [[hoof]]marks and failed to see any rhinoceros. It is rumored that the noted Assamese animal tracker '''Balaram Hazarika''' showed Mary Curzon around Kaziranga and impressed upon her the urgency of conservation. <ref name = "bbc">Subir Bhaumik, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/south_asia/4274927.stm Kaziranga's centenary celebrations], [[BBC News]], [[South Asia]], [[18 February]] [[2005]] </ref> Concerned about the dwindling numbers of rhinos, she asked her husband to take necessary action to save the rhinoceros. The Kaziranga Proposed [[Reserved forests of India|Reserve Forest]] was thus created on 57,273.6 [[acre]]s of land, on [[June 1]], [[1905]] by notification of the Chief [[Commissioner#India|Commissioner]] of the area. <ref> Sushanta Talukdar, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/01/05/stories/2005010503052000.htm Waiting for Curzon's kin to celebrate Kaziranga], [[The Hindu]], [[January 5]], [[2005]]</ref>

A proposal was made to extend the Kaziranga Reserved Forest by including a piece of land to the east of the existing reserve towards the Bokakhat Dhansirimukh road. Local people objected to this as their rights towards grazing, fishing, collection of cane, thatch and firewood etc would be in danger while the European community of tea planters objected to the proposal mainly on the ground that the area available for big game shooting would be greatly reduced. Another objection was that during the rainy season there used to be a good deal of boating down the [[Difloo river]] and the [[Mori Dhansiri river]] through which tea from the neighboring tea gardens were taken into the [[Brahmaputra river]]. At last with the interventions of the Forest Settlement Officer and Deputy Commissioner, Sibsagar District Major A. Playfair, an area of 13,506 acres was added to the Kaziranga reserve vide notification No.295 R dated 28th January 1913. <ref name= "kazi100"/>

In later years another proposal was made to add extra land towards the north of the reserve to provide shelter to the wild animals during the flood as the ground was comparatively higher and also to protect the wild animals from the danger of possible epidemics spreading through the domestic livestock. The presence of a large number of domestic buffaloes belonging to Nepali grazers in the proposed area caused much delay in the final making of the Reserved Forest. However the Chief Commissioner decided in favour of making the reserve and finally an area of 37,529 acres of land extending the Kaziranga Reserve up to the Brahmaputra River was notified vide notification No.3560 R dated the 26th July 1917. <ref name= "kazi100"/>

 
The additions continued and an area of 151 acres was further added to the Kaziranga reserve vide notification No.FOF/WL/512/66/17 on  7th April 1967<ref name= "kazi100"/> extending the reserve to the south of the National Highway No.37 to provide a corridor to the animals to cross over to the [[Karbi Anglong]] Hills during the flood. 

Finally, the proposal to declare Kaziranga as a [[National Park]] was taken up by the then Chief Conservator of Forests, P. Baruah. To achieve this objective "The Assam National Park Act of 1968" was passed by the [[Government of Assam]], as there was no provision to create a National Park under the existing Forest Regulations. Kaziranga became a National Park with an area of 42,993 hectares vide notification No.FOR/WL/722/68 dated 11th February 1974. <ref name= "kazi100"/>

Later several new areas were added as additions to the National Park. The 1st addition (area 43.79 sq km on 28th May 1977), the 2nd addition (area 6.47 sq km vide preliminary notification on 10th July 1985), 3rd addition (area 0.69 sq km on 31st May 1985), 4th addition (area 0.89 sq km on 3rd August 1988), 5th addition (area 1.15 sq km on 13th June 1985), and the 6th additions (area 376.50 sq km on 7th August 1999) were made. <ref name= "kazi100"/>
Two reserve forests Panbari (area of 1894 acres) and Kukurakata (3936 acres) also came under the administrative control of the Kaziranga National Park. <ref name= "kazi100"/>

The park formally became a [[Reserve forest]] in [[1908]], a ''game sanctuary'' in [[1916]], and was officially closed for shooting in [[1926]]. Kaziranga was thrown open to visitors in [[1938]]. After the [[independence of India]], Kaziranga was declared a [[wildlife sanctuaries of India|Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[1950]]. The Assam state legislature was modified in [[1954]], by giving the rhino legal protection through the [[Assam (Rhinoceros) Bill]] that laid down heavy penalties for killing rhinoceros. In [[1974]] Kaziranga was designated a [[national parks of India|National Park]], the first national park in the state of Assam. [[UNESCO]] declared Kaziranga a [[World Heritage Site]] in [[1985]]. <ref>[http://www.nenanews.com/NEE%20Feb.22-March%206,%2005/TravelC.htm Travel Column], ''North East Enquirer'', Vol. 3 Issue No. 22</ref>

Additional lands have been incorporated into the park, and a proposal to add some 45,450 hectares has been put forward to include the adjoining section of the Brahmaputra River to the north and part of the [[Mikir Hills]] to the south, to provide a protected refuge where animals can take shelter during floods.<ref name="un"/>

The [[ULFA]] [[separatist]] movement in Assam however did not significantly affect the park's wildlife or tourism, unlike [[Manas National Park]] in Assam, and it has been reported that the ULFA actually "tried" and killed rhino [[poacher]]s in the late 1980s. <ref name = "bbc"/> 

The park celebrated its centenary with much fanfare in [[2005]], inviting descendants of Lord Curzon for the celebrations, and combining the celebrations with the annual Kaziranga '''Elephant Festival'''. <ref name = "bbc"/>

===Human habitation in the area===
The area around Kaziranga is part of the Middle Brahmaputra [[flood plains]], and is flooded virtually every year, hence there have not been any large permanent settlements in the area in historic times.{{Facts|date=February 2007}} Some villages are located to the south of the park along the foothills of the [[Karbi Anglong]] Hills and [[Mikir Hills]] to the South, including the village of ''Kaziranga''.{{Facts|date=February 2007}} A few new settlements have come up in recent times outside the park borders for servicing the booming [[eco-tourism]] industry. {{Facts|date=February 2007}}

The capital [[Sibsagar]], of the medieval [[Ahom]] kingdom, was located roughly 50 km.s from the Eastern boundary of the park, as the crow flies. {{Facts|date=February 2007}}

==Geography of the park==
===Etymology of the name===
There exists a folk story behind the name Kaziranga, which tells of a young man named Kazi from [[Karbi Anglong]] who fell in love with Ranga, a village girl. Their parents did not give consent to their affair, so they continued to meet each other in the forest. One day, both of them apparently disappeared in the forest and never returned, and the forest was thereafter named Kaziranga. <ref>[http://www.kaziranga100.com/Myth.htm Kaziranga-Myth] Accessed on February 23, 2007</ref>

===Political Geography===
[[Image:Kaziranga-map.jpg|thumb| Topographical, political and land use map of the Kaziranga area<ref>U.S. Army Map Service, Series U-502, map NG 46-7, Jorhat, India, 1962.[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/india/txu-oclc-6614190-ng46-7.jpg]</ref>]]
The park is located in the [[Kaliabor Subdivision]] of the [[Nagaon District]], and also in the [[Bokakhat Subdivision]] of the [[Golaghat District]], in the state of Assam in India. The administrative headquarters are located in the town of [[Bokakhat]]. It is roughly 40 km long by 13 km wide. It is 37,822 [[hectare]]s in area, having lost around 5,114 hectares to erosion by the Brahmaputra. <ref>Lahan, P. & Sonowal, R. (1973), Kaziranga WildLife Sanctuary, Assam. A brief description and report on the census of large animals (March 1972). Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 70: (2): 245-277</ref> The land is owned by the State [[Government of Assam]]. The park is located between latitude 26°30 N to 26°45 N and longitude 93°08 E to 93°36 E . <ref name = "un"/>  

The park is bordered by village settlements on three sides, which are serviced by the national highway [[NH37]] - there are as many as 39 villages within a 10 km radius of the park, with a  roughly estimated population of 22,300 people in 1983-1984. <ref name = "un"> [http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/kazirang.html UN Kaziranga factsheet]</ref>

===Physical Geography <ref name = "un"/>===
[[Image:Kazi-sat.PNG|right|thumb|A satellite image of the Kaziranga area showing the shifting waters of the Brahmaputra]] 

Bounded by the hills of Barail and the Mikir Hills to the south, the southern border of the park is roughly defined by the [[Mora Diphlu]] River, and the national highway NH-37 was once the formal southern boundary of the park. The Brahmaputra River constitutes the dynamically changing Northern boundary of the park. The Eastern [[Himalaya]]n foothill ranges are clearly visible from the park, which is part of the highly fertile Middle Brahmaputra [[alluvium|alluvial]] [[flood plains]]. 

Kaziranga is thus mostly flat expanses of fertile alluvial silt, exposed [[sandbar]]s and riverine flood-formed lakes called [[bheel]]s (''bheel''s make up as much as 5% of the surface area). The altitude of the park ranges from 40m to 80m<ref name = "un"/>  , with the Mikir Hills to the south of the park rising to around 1220 m<ref name = "un"/>  .

===Climate===
The Middle Brahmaputra Valley is one of the rainiest places on earth (see [[climate of India]]), and Kaziranga gets around 250 cm of rain per year. The park is flooded often by the Brahmaputra - necessary for maintaining the biological balance of the park, and slopes gently from the East to the West. It is not uncommon for the park to be flooded for 5 - 10 days at a time, and around three quarters of the Western reaches of the park - '''Baguri''' is annually submerged. <ref name = "un"/>

The park roughly experiences 3 seasons - summer, monsoon and winter. The dry and windy summer extends approximately from February to May with mean maximum and minimums of 37°C and 7°C . The Monsoon season extends from June to September, corresponding to hot and humid conditions, with a mean rainfall of 2220 mm of rainfall brought by the South West [[Monsoon]] in just this season. The winter, extending from November to February, is pleasantly mild and dry, with the mean maximum and minimum being 25°C and 5°C. <ref  name="kushwaha">Kushwaha, S.& Unni, M. (1986).

===Administrative breakup===
There are three dirt tracks inside the park corresponding to the three [[forest range]]s of the park:
*Central or Kaziranga range - ''Kohora'' (entry point), ''Daglang'', ''Foliomari'' - Some part of this range is the ''Core Zone'' of the [[Tiger Reserve]] or a [[World_Conservation_Union#Protected_Area_Management_Categories|Strict Nature Reserve]], where casual visitors are not permitted
*Western range - ''Baguri'' (entry point), ''Monabeel'', ''Bimoli'', ''Kanchanjuri'' - This is preferred for seeing [[big game]] like rhinos and water buffaloes.
*Eastern range - ''Agortoli'' (entry point), ''Sohola'', ''Rangamatia'' - This is 30 km from Kohora, but is preferred for birding.

==Natural History of the Park==
[[Image:Assam 042.jpg|thumb|Flooded grasslands in Kaziranga with elephant / jeep trails nearby]]
Kaziranga is one of the largest tracts of protected land in the sub-[[Himalaya]]n belt, and due to its high species diversity and presence of high-visibility species, has been described as a "[[biodiversity hotspot]]". <ref>[http://www.sosrhino.org/news/rhinonews021405.php Horn of Plenty], Pramila N. Phatarphekar, [[Outlook India]], [[February 14]], [[2005]] </ref>

===Biomes===

The park is located in the [[Indomalaya ecozone]], and the dominant [[biome]]s of the region are:

*[[Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests]] of the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] biome
*A frequently flooded variant of the [[Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands]] of the [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome

===Fauna===
====Mammals====
[[Image:Kazi-rhino.jpg|right|thumb|A rhinoceros grazing at Kaziranga National Park]]
[[Image:Kazi-elegrass.jpg|thumb|A wild elephant in tall [[elephant grass]] at Kaziranga]]
The park contains significant breeding populations of 35 mammalian species <ref>[http://www.kaziranga100.com/Manals%20Checklist.htm Kaziranga Mammals Checklist]</ref>, out of which 15 are threatened mammals according to the [[IUCN Red List]] <ref name = "un"/>.

The park has the world's single largest breeding population of Indian rhinoceros <ref name = "un"/>, with the 2006 [[census]] estimating the present population to be around 1855, around 70% of the world's total wild population of 2700. <ref name = "tiger"> [http://www.savethetigerfund.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=2738 Kaziranga adds another feather - declared tiger reserve], Syed Zakir Hussain, [[Indo-Asian News Service]], [[August 10]], [[2006]]</ref>

The park contains significant stock of three other large herbivores - the [[Asian Elephant]], the [[Asiatic Water Buffalo]] and the subspecies Eastern [[Swamp Deer]] (''Cervus duvauceli ranjitsinghi''). A census on wild Asiatic Buffaloes in [[March]], [[2001]] revealed the presence of 1666 buffaloes - the largest single population of the species reported in this millenium <ref>'Wild buffalo census in Kaziranga', The Rhino Foundation for Nature in NE India, Newsletter No. 3, June 2001</ref>, up from 677 in the [[1984]] census. Assam is India's most populous state with respect to Asiatic Elephants (an estimated 5,500 out of a total of 10,000 wild Asiatic elephants in India live in Assam), and Kaziranga contains as many as 1206 elephants (from the 2005 census), up from 1048 individuals (in the 2002 census). The combined '''Kaziranga - Karbi Anglong Elephant Reserve''' has as many as 1940 elephants according to the 2005 survey <ref>[http://envfor.nic.in/pe/census_ereserves2005.pdf Elephant survey], Government of India, 2005</ref>.

The Eastern race of the Swamp Deer also had 468 individuals existing as noted in the [[2002]] census <ref name = "trib">[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050828/spectrum/main2.htm Here conservation is a way of life], Parbina Rashid, [[The Tribune]], [[August 28]], [[2005]]</ref>, down from 756 individuals noted in the [[1984]] census <ref name = "un"/>. Other stable populations of large herbivores include the [[Gaur]] (30 individuals in 1984) and the [[Sambar]] (358 in 1984). Smaller herbivores include the [[Indian Muntjac]] (100 in the 1972 census), [[Barking Deer]] and [[Hog Deer]].

The park has a large variety of primates - including all free roaming primates in India with the exception of the [[endemic]] [[Western Ghats]] primates and the newly discovered [[Arunachal Macaque]]. This includes the vulnerable and rare species of [[Bengal Slow Loris]], [[Assamese Macaque]], [[Capped Langur]], [[Golden Langur]] and the only [[ape]] found in [[India]] - the [[Hoolock Gibbon]]. <ref name= "splist"> [http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/10/stories/2003091005480300.htm Kaziranga to be thrown open to tourists from October], [[The Hindu]], [[September 10]], [[2003]]</ref>

Kaziranga also has the rare distinction of being one of the very few places in the world which contains breeding population of three [[big cat]]s outside [[Africa]] - the [[Royal Bengal Tiger]], the [[Indian Leopard]] and the [[Clouded Leopard]]. <ref name = "splist"/> Kaziranga had a population of around 30 Bengal Tigers during the 1972 census, which grew to 86 in the 2000 census. This made Kaziranga the protected area with the highest tiger density in the world (0.2 tigers / sq [[km]]), and Kaziranga formally became a [[Tiger Reserve]] in [[2006]]. <ref name = "tiger"/>

The park is also home to [[Sloth Bear]]s and to lesser [[felid]]s like the [[Jungle Cat]], [[Fishing Cat]] and the [[Leopard Cat]]. Other small mammals include the rare [[Hispid Hare]] and several common species of [[mongoose]] ([[Indian Gray Mongoose]], [[Small Indian Mongoose]]), [[civet]]s ([[Large Indian Civet]], [[Small Indian Civet]]), small [[canid]]s ([[Bengal Fox]], [[Golden Jackal]])  pangolins ([[Chinese Pangolin]], [[Indian Pangolin]]), [[weasel]]s ([[Hog Badger]], [[Chinese Ferret Badger]]), the [[Particolored flying squirrel]] and [[bat]]s. <ref name = "un"/>

Kaziranga's rivers (especially the adjoining stretch of the [[Brahmaputra]]) are home to the blind, highly endangered [[Ganges Dolphin]]. <ref name = "un"/>

Even though the ubiquitous [[Wild Boar]] is present in Kaziranga, and [[Assam]] was part of the historical range of the critically endangered [[Pygmy Hog]], the Pygmy Hog is no longer found in Kaziranga. The [[Indian Javan Rhinoceros]] was probably also an inhabitant of Kaziranga before becoming extinct. <ref name = "wwf">[http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/asia_pacific/our_programmes/areas/projects/indochina_bioregion/cat_loc_cat_tien_background/index.cfm     WWF article], accessed [[February 26]], [[2007]]</ref>

Kaziranga's extremely diverse range of [[megafauna]] is probably only matched by the famous game parks of Southern and Eastern Africa. <ref>NB: From the list of [[megafauna]] and their distributions]]</ref>

[[Image:Kazi-openbill.jpg|thumb|An [[Asian Openbill]] at Kaziranga]]
Kaziranga is an important bird refuge with almost 478 species of birds (both migratory and resident) having been spotted at the park, including 25 globally threatened and 21 near threatened species <ref name="kaziavi">[http://www.kaziranga100.com/Avifauna.htm Kaziranga Avifauna]</ref>. The park has also been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[Birdlife International]] for the conservation of the avifaunal species. <ref name="kaziavi"/>. 

A large number of waterfowl breed in or pass through Kaziranga including several rare species of [[geese]] ([[Lesser White-fronted Goose]]), and [[duck]]s ([[Ferruginous Pochard]], [[Baer's Pochard]]). Other rare riverine birds include [[kingfisher]]s ([[Blyth's Kingfisher]]), [[heron]]s ([[White-bellied Heron]]), [[pelican]]s ([[Dalmatian Pelican]], [[Spot-billed Pelican]]), [[shank]]s ([[Spotted Greenshank]]) and [[tern]]s ([[Black-bellied Tern]]). Rare [[Migratory birds|migratory]] [[stork]]s and [[crane]]s are also seen wintering in the park ([[Lesser Adjutant]], [[Greater Adjutant]], [[Black-necked Stork]], [[Asian Openbill]]).

[[Image:Kazi-sunbird.jpg|thumb|A [[Crimson Sunbird]] at Kaziranga]]
Kaziranga hosts a large number of [[raptor]]s, a sign of a healthy [[ecosystem]] - including the rare [[Eastern Imperial Eagle]], [[Greater Spotted Eagle]], [[White-tailed Fishing Eagle]], [[Pallas's Fish Eagle]], [[Grey-headed Fish Eagle]] and the [[Lesser Kestrel]]. Kaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures. A great majority of these (approximately 99% of the stable population) was wiped out by [[kidney failure]] by consuming the [[veterinary]] drug [[diclofenac]] in [[domestic animal]] carcasses. Of these, the [[Red-headed Vulture]], and [[Eurasian Black Vulture]] are still near threatened due to their large range, but the [[Indian Vulture]], [[Slender-billed Vulture]] and the [[Indian White-rumped Vulture]] have suffered cataclysmic loss of numbers and are virtually extinct in the wild, including Kaziranga. The Indian populations of the other two vultures have also taken similar hits - the [[Griffon Vulture]] and the [[Himalayan Griffon]], but they are still well represented outside India. The loss of vultures creates a critical [[ecological niche]] vacancy in Kaziranga.

[[Image:Assam 012.jpg|thumb|An [[Indian  Roller]] at Kaziranga]]
Other rare [[game bird]]s (which were once hunted) include [[partridge]]s ([[Swamp Francolin]]), [[bustard]]s ([[Bengal Florican]]) and [[pigeon]]s ([[Pale-capped Pigeon]]).

Several other important families of birds inhabit Kaziranga, including rare species of [[hornbill]]s ([[Great Indian Hornbill]] and the lesser risk [[Wreathed Hornbill]]) [[Old World babbler]]s ([[Jerdon's Babbler]], [[Marsh Babbler]]) and [[weaver bird]]s (the common [[Baya Weaver]] and the threatened [[Finn's Weaver]]), [[thrush]]es ([[Hodgson’s Bushchat]]), [[Old World warblers]] ([[Bristled Grassbird]]). Other threatened species include the [[Black-breasted Parrotbill]] and [[Rufous-vented Prinia]].

Kaziranga was probably a habitat for the once-elusive and now-extinct [[Pink-headed Duck]].

====Reptiles, Amphibians and Fish <ref>[http://www.kaziranga100.com/Reptiles%20checklist.htm Kaziranga Reptiles List]</ref>====
[[Image:Kazi-pallaseagle.jpg|thumb|A [[Pallas's Fish Eagle]] at Kaziranga - Kaziranga has large populations of several species of fishing eagles due to its large numbers of lakes and rivers]]
A total of 42 species of reptile have been reported from the park. These include the endangered [[Gharial]] and the rare [[Assam Roofed Turtle]]. 

Two of the largest snakes in the world -  the [[Reticulated Python]] and the [[Rock Python]], as well as the longest venomous snake in the world - the [[King Cobra]] are common inside the park. The park also contains [[Bengal monitor]] and [[Water Monitor]] populations. The park is home to the rare [[Monocled Cobra]], as well as three of the [[Big Four (Indian snakes)|Big Four]] - [[Indian Cobra]], [[Russell's Viper]] and [[Common Krait]]. 

In all, Kaziranga is home to 15 species of [[turtles]], including the endemic Assam Roofed Turtle, and to one species of tortoise - the [[Brown Tortoise]]. A regional lizard species is also found in Kaziranga - the [[Calotes maria|Assam Garden Lizard]].

42 species of fishes are found in the Kaziranga area, including a species of [[freshwater]] [[pufferfish]] [[Tetraodon cutcutia]]. <ref>[http://www.kaziranga100.com/Fishes%20Checklist.htm Kaziranga Fish List]</ref>

===Flora <ref name = "un"/>===
[[Image:Kazi-broadleaf.jpg|thumb|[[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|Moist broadleaf forest]]s in Kaziranga]]

Four main types of vegetation types exist in the park <ref>Talukdar, B. (1995). Status of Swamp Deer in Kaziranga National Park. Department of Zoology, Gauhati University, Assam.</ref>:
*[[Flooded grasslands and savannas|Alluvial inundated grassland]]s
*[[Tropical_and_subtropical_grasslands%2C_savannas%2C_and_shrublands|Alluvial savanna woodland]]s
*[[Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests|Tropical moist mixed deciduous forests]] and [[Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests|Tropical semi-evergreen forests]]

Based on [[Landsat]] data for [[1986]], coverage by different vegetation is as follows: tall grasses 41%, short grasses 11%, open jungle 29%, swamps 4%, rivers and water bodies 8%, and sand 6%.<ref  name= "kushwaha"/>

Grasslands dominate the western reaches of the park which are typically lower than the eastern end, with tall [[elephant grass]] on the higher ground while the short grasses covers the lower ground surrounding the [[bheel]]s or flood created ponds. Annual [[flooding]], [[grazing]] by [[herbivore]]s  and [[controlled burn]]ing maintains and fertilizes the grasslands and reeds. The common tall grasses are sugarcanes ([[Saccharum spontaneum]], [[Saccharum]] naranga), [[Imperata]] cylindrica, [[Erianthus]] spp., [[Arundo donax]] and the Common Reed ([[Phragmites]] karka). Numerous [[forb]]s are present along with the grasses. Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered trees - dominant species include [[Careya]] arborea, [[Phyllanthus_emblica|Emblica officinalis]], the [[cotton]] tree or [[Bombax ceiba]] (in savanna woodlands), and [[Dillenia]] indica (in inundated grasslands).

There are many different aquatic flora in the lakes, ponds and along the river shores. The [[invasive species]] [[Water Hyacinth]] is very common, often choking up open water, but is cleared during destructive floods.

Another invasive species, [[Mimosa invisa]] of the [[Mimosa]] genus which is [[toxic]] to herbivores, was cleared by Kaziranga staff, with help from the [[Wildlife Trust of India]] in 2005. <ref>[http://www.wildlifetrustofindia.org/html/reports/Silent_Stranglers.pdf Silent Stranglers, Eradication of [[Mimosa]]s in Kaziranga National Park, Assam]; Vattakkavan et al; Occassional Report No. 12, [[Wildlife Trust of India]]</ref>

Kaziranga started in 1908 as a reserve forest to protect rhinoceros and other wild animals. Thereafter shooting was prohibited and exploitation of forest products was stopped. However limited grazing was permitted till the declaration of the area as a national park. Kaziranga has a long history of management and practices include annual burning of the grasslands by wildlife staff. <ref name = "un"/> Kaziranga has a good conservation history, especially due to its efficient management policies. 

'''Control of poaching''' - Includes maintenance of existing and construction of new poaching camps, adequate staffing, providing mobility, patrolling, intelligence gathering, firearms and control over the use of firearms around the park. <ref name= "kazi100"/> The park has about 122 anti-poaching camps <ref name="kazihero">[http://www.kaziranga100.com/The%20Heroes.htm Heroes of Kaziranga] </ref>scattered throughout the Park, including two floating camps on the Brahmaputra river. There are 123 country boats, 6 mechanised boats, 4 speed boats (OBM), 2 motor launches, 20 motor vehicles and 47 departmental elephants to assist the anti-poaching squad. <ref name="kazihero"/> There are some 800 personnel, which include about 200 forest guards, game watchers, home guards, forest protection force, and temporary staff who guard the park round the clock. <ref name="kazihero"/> The foresters are provided with 346 numbers of .315 bore rifles, 33 SBBL, 18 DBBL, five revolvers, 20 fixed and mobile wireless stations and more than a hundred walkie-talkies which helps in the anti-poaching activities and in fighting against the poachers. <ref name="kazihero"/>
