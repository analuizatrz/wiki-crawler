'''Northern Kentucky University''' ('''NKU''') is a [[state university (U.S.)|public]], [[co-educational]] [[university]] located in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]], seven miles (11 km) southeast of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].  NKU is primarily an [[undergraduate]], [[liberal arts]] institution, but it also features [[graduate school|graduate]] programs. Total enrollment at the university currently exceeds 14,000 students, with over 12,000 undergraduate students and nearly 2,000 graduate students. NKU is the second largest university in [[Cincinnati-Hamilton, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area|Greater Cincinnati]] and the youngest of [[Kentucky]]'s eight [[state universities]].

==History==
[[Image:NKU-library-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|NKU's W. Frank Steely Library]]
=== Early history ===
NKU's history began in 1948, when an extension campus for the [[University of Kentucky]] was opened in [[Covington, Kentucky]], known as the '''UK Northern Extension Center'''.<ref>http://alumniconnect.nku.edu/surveys/?id=40th_Challenge</ref> After 20 years in operation as an extension center for UK, it became its own college in 1968, when NKU was founded originally as '''Northern Kentucky State College''' ('''NKSC''').  Three years later, in 1971, the [[Salmon P. Chase College of Law]], formerly an independent law school in [[Cincinnati]], merged with Northern Kentucky State College. The main campus moved from Covington to [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]] in 1972. NKSC awarded its first bachelor's degrees in May 1973. Northern Kentucky State College was expanded and renamed to '''Northern Kentucky University''' in 1976, the name it has kept ever since.<ref name=google1>[http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:JN4qXX8XtKcJ:access.nku.edu/catalog/2007Catalog/final/GeneralSection.pdf+site:nku.edu+founded+1968&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us Google cached page from NKU 2007 catalog]</ref>

=== Recent history ===
Since its founding in 1968 and name change in 1976, NKU has expanded with numerous construction projects, new colleges, and a much larger, more diverse student body. The current president of NKU, Dr. James C. Votruba, is largely credited with transforming the image of the university since his arrival in 1997, helping to build NKU's reputation as a respected academic institution.<ref>[http://www.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-11-27#7676 NKU counts on Votruba - Person, place fit perfectly for 10 years]</ref> As part of Votruba's administration, the university has increased its admissions standards and improved the academic performance of its students. NKU also launched a new university logo and branding effort in 2002.<ref>http://media.www.thenortherner.com/media/storage/paper527/news/2002/11/06/News/New-Logo.For.A.Changing.University-315539.shtml</ref> In recent years, the university has also concentrated on the construction of new and improved facilities across campus.

==Campus==
[[Image:NKU-arena-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|NKU's welcome sign, skywalk, and new arena, [[Bank of Kentucky Arena|The Bank of Kentucky Center]]]]
=== Highland Heights ===
Northern Kentucky University's main campus in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]] is situated on about 400 acres of rolling countryside along [[U.S. Route 27]], just off of [[Interstate 275 (Ohio)|Interstate 275]] and [[Interstate 471]], seven miles (11 km) southeast of [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. The campus was built beginning in the early 1970s, and the first building, Nunn Hall, opened in 1972.<ref name=google1 />

Although most of NKU's students commute daily to the campus, approximately 1,500 students live on campus, which creates an atmosphere of a smaller, private university but with the resources of a larger, public university.

NKU is currently in the process of expanding its campus and facilities.  There are currently multiple construction projects across the campus. The $60 million [[Bank of Kentucky Arena|Bank of Kentucky Center]] is a recently completed 9,400 seating-capacity arena.  It will serve as the primary venue for athletics on campus, and also as a venue for entertainment, such as live bands and concerts.  The arena is named after the Bank of Kentucky, which made an endowment of $5 million toward construction.

[[Image:NKU-studentunion-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|NKU's new Student Union building, under construction as of June 2008]]
Additionally, a new $37 million, {{convert|144000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} Student Union building, to open in fall 2008, is designed to accommodate student needs on campus. The location will include stores, cafeterias and other amenities for students. Other recent projects include the construction of a new parking garage to accommodate the arena and a European-style roundabout for traffic control and flow-management.

NKU is also planning to construct a $30 million four-story complex featuring a 100-room hotel, a {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} upscale restaurant and retail area, and {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|-3}} of office space. The most recent NKU master plan envisions a massive expansion of the campus by the year 2020, including multiple new buildings, housing developments, campus quad areas, athletic fields, parking lots, and connector roads.<ref>http://access.nku.edu/campusplan/2007%20Masterplan.htm</ref>

The Landrum Academic Center on the Highland Heights campus houses an Anthropology Museum. The NKU campus is also the first educational institute in the world to have a laser-projection planetarium, as part of the Dorothy Westerman Hermann Natural Science Center.
