The [[spider]] genus '''''Steatoda''''', in the family [[Theridiidae]], includes over 120 recognized [[species]], distributed around the world (including many cosmopolitan species which are found among human populations worldwide). 

These usually dark spiders have in most species a white line around the anterior back, in addition to other lines or spots.

Many spiders of the genus ''Steatoda'' are often mistaken for [[widow spider]]s, and are known as '''false black widows'''; however ''Steatoda'' are significantly less harmful to humans. ''Steatoda'' are shaped similarly to widow spiders, with round, bulbous abdomens. However, not all ''Steatoda'' species resemble widows - many have distinct coloring, and are significantly smaller than ''Latrodectus'' specimens. Some species of ''Steatoda'' actually will prey on widows, as well as other spiders which are considered hazardous to humans.  

Some members of this genus do have bites which are medically significant in humans (such as ''S. grossa'' and ''S. nobilis''), however bites by ''Steatoda'' species generally do not have any long-lasting effects. The symptoms associated with the bite of several ''steatoda'' species are known in the medical profession as '''steatodism'''; and have been described as a less-severe form of ''latrodectism'' (the symptoms associated with a widow spider bite). The [[redback spider]] [[antivenin]] has been shown to be effective at treating bites from ''Steatoda grossa'', after it was mistakenly administered to a ''S. grossa'' bite victim who was erroneously believed to have been bitten by the far more dangerous redback.

In common with other members of the ''Theridiidae'' family, the ''Steatoda'' spiders construct a cobweb, i.e., an irregular tangle of sticky silken fibers. As with other web-weavers, these spiders have very poor eyesight and depend mostly on vibrations reaching them through their webs to orient themselves to prey or warn them of larger animals that could injure or kill them. They are not aggressive, and most injuries to humans are due to defensive bites delivered when a spider gets unintentionally squeezed or pinched somehow. It is possible that some bites may result when a spider mistakes a finger thrust into its web for its normal prey, but ordinarily intrusion by any large creature will cause these spiders to flee. 
These spiders are now increasing in numbers in the United Kingdom due to global warming.

==Species==
There are currently over 120 recognized species in ''Steatoda''.  Those commonly mistaken for widows include:

[[Image:Australiansteatoda.JPG|180px|left|thumb|A Steatoda found in Australia.]] 
* ''S. borealis''.  A common species in North America, often mistaken for the [[Black widow spider|black widow]] (despite being smaller and having colored markings on the dorsal side of the abdomen, rather than the ventral side).
* ''S. capensis''.  The [[false katipo spider]], a species which originates in [[South Africa]] and is found in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; in the latter location it is often confused with the [[katipo]] and [[black katipo]] spiders.
* ''[[Steatoda grossa|S. grossa]]'', often known as the '''cupboard spider'''.  A dark-colored spider which resembles specimens of [[Latrodectus]], though without the characteristic bright marks found on most widow spiders.  This spider is known to capture and eat true widows.  Bites by ''S. grossa'' have been known to produce symptoms similar to (but far less severe than) the bites of true widows.  Originally from Europe, but now found worldwide.
* ''[[Steatoda nobilis|S. nobilis]]''.  This spider, a native of the [[Canary Islands]], has since been introduced into [[England]].  It has acquired a bad reputation due to its reportedly-painful bite, including a case of man needing treatment for symptoms of heart seizure.<ref name="david-sapsted">David Sapsted, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/17/nspider17.xml "Watch out, the black widow's sister is ready to bite you"], Daily Telegraph, 2006-11-17</ref>
* ''S. paykulliana'', another spider which is often confused with ''Latrodectus''.  This one is generally found in the range of ''[[Latrodectus tredecimguttatus]]'' and is frequently confused with it.  Has a medically significant (but not serious) bite.

==Other notable and recognizable species==

Other notable and recognizable species in the genus include:

* ''S. bipunctata''.  A common house spider in Europe.
* ''S. triangulosa'', the [[triangulate cobweb spider]], a common household spider noted for a pattern of triangles on the dorsal side of its abdomen.  Not known to bite; found worldwide.
* ''S. hespera'', the [[western bud spider]].  This species is commonly found in the western [[United States]] and [[Canada]], where it is an effective predator of the [[hobo spider]].  It is often confused (by laypersons) with the black widow, despite being significantly smaller (7 to 8 mm) and having no bright-colored markings.  Not known to bite humans, but has a venom which is similar to ''S. paykulliana'' (a medically significant spider of this genus).
