'''''Goldfinger''''' is the third film in the [[EON Productions]] [[James Bond]] series, and the third starring [[Sean Connery]] as Commander James Bond, British Secret Service agent 007. Released in December [[1964 in film|1964]], the film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and was the first of four directed by [[Guy Hamilton]].

This film is one of the most critically acclaimed of the James Bond film series. In 1965 [[Norman Wanstall]] received an [[Academy Award for Sound Editing]] for his work on the film. The [[American Film Institute]] has also honoured the film four times ranking it No. 90 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|best movie quote]] ("A martini. [[Shaken, not stirred]]."), No. 53 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Songs|best song]] ("Goldfinger"), No. 49 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|best villain]] ([[Auric Goldfinger]]), and No. 71 for [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Thrills|most thrilling film]].

''Goldfinger'' was the first James Bond film broadcast on [[United States|U.S.]] television, on [[September 17]], [[1972]] by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Simultaneously, it garnered the highest [[Nielsen Ratings]] of any film broadcast on television: 49 percent of all viewers.

==Background==
''Goldfinger'', film critics have argued {{Fact|date=February 2007}} is the turning point of the [[James Bond]] films, both artistically and in its impact on popular culture. This was the first film to emphasize the high technology that became a staple of the film series. Likewise, ''Goldfinger'' reflected director [[Guy Hamilton]]'s determined, tongue-in-cheek approach to the film's story. ''Goldfinger'' had a (then-relatively) large budget: $3.5 million dollars, and was the first James Bond film classified as a box-office [[blockbuster]].

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:Miamibeachnorth.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Goldfinger is first seen on [[Miami Beach]]]]
In the pre-title sequence, Bond destroys a Mexican drug lord's base with plastic explosives, and defeats a Mexican thug in a bedroom brawl (electrocuting him, impromptu, in a bathtub with a heat lamp, foreshadowing [[Oddjob]]'s death). The film's story-proper begins in [[Miami Beach]], [[Florida]], U.S.A., with CIA agent Felix Leiter delivering to Bond a message from M to watch Auric Goldfinger.
[[Image:Shirley4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jill Masterson]]]]
Bond foils Goldfinger's cheating at [[gin rummy]], by distracting his woman employee, [[Jill Masterson]], who is reporting Goldfinger's opponent's hand by using binoculars. After foiling the scheme and forcing Goldfinger to lose, Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship in Bond's hotel suite. Afterwards, as Bond fetches fresh champagne from the kitchen, he is struck unconscious  by Oddjob, Goldfinger's Korean manservant. Once conscious Bond discovers Jill covered with gold paint, dead of epidermal suffocation.

Later in London, Bond learns that his true mission is determining (per the Bank of England's request) how Goldfinger (an international jeweler-businessman) transports gold among countries, and to determine if he is doing so illegally. Bond meets Goldfinger, socially, on a golf course (it is then unclear if Goldfinger knows of Bond's role in his card loss). They play a high-stakes golf game; Bond lures Goldfinger with the prospect of winning a [[Nazi]] gold bar from [[World War II]]; Goldfinger cheats, Bond discovers him, yet allows the cheating to continue, switching Goldfinger's golf ball and forcing his loss, as they were playing strict rules. After settling the bet, Goldfinger warns Bond (acknowledging he recognizes him from Miami), by having Oddjob decapitate a statue with his steel-rimmed [[top hat]]. When Bond asks about the damaged golf club property, Goldfinger tells him he owns the club.

Bond implants a homing device in Goldfinger's automobile and follows him to [[Switzerland]], where he meets Tilly Masterson, Jill's sister. Tilly shoots at Goldfinger with a [[sniper rifle]], missing him, but almost shoots Bond instead. As Tilly flees the scene in her Ford Mustang, Bond catches up to her and slashes two of her car's tires with a spike extended from the [[Aston Martin DB5]] wheel hub; subsequently, Bond takes her to a service station.

That night, Bond reconnoiters Goldfinger's plant, learning that Goldfinger has a foundry and is casting parts of his [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]] in 18 kt. gold (white gold in the novel), to smuggle the gold from England to Europe. He also overhears Goldfinger talking with a Red Chinese agent about 'Operation Grandslam'. Leaving, he encounters Tilly re-trying to shoot Goldfinger, and accidentally trips an alarm. During their escape (deploying most of the car's modifications), Oddjob breaks Tilly's neck with a throw of his hat and Bond is captured.
[[Image:007Goldfingerlaserclassic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The laser scene]]
Bond wakes tied to a gold table underneath an industrial [[laser]], the beam of which is set to slowly slice the table, and Bond, in half. Goldfinger explains the laser to Bond (a high technology novelty in 1964): Bond, nervously, "I think you've made your point, Goldfinger. Thank you for the demonstration." Non-plussed, Goldfinger replies, "Choose your next witticism carefully, Mr. Bond. It may be your last." Bond asks "Do you expect me to talk?" Goldfinger's reply is "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to ''die''!" Bond then bluffs his way out of impending death by telling Goldfinger that another Double-O agent will replace him and possesses the same information about Operation Grand Slam that Bond does. Goldfinger realizes that he cannot take the risk and orders the laser to be shut down. Bond is shot with a [[tranquilizer dart]] and passes out.

Bond awakes aboard Goldfinger's private [[Lockheed JetStar]] aircraft, piloted by Pussy Galore. She tells Bond that they are flying at 35,000 feet (10,700 m) to Baltimore, en route to Goldfinger's Kentucky stud farm, near [[Fort Knox]]. During the flight, Pussy points a revolver at Bond; Bond lectures her that a .45 calibre bullet would pass through him and the fuselage "like a blow torch through butter" and would explosively depressurise the cabin. In flight, he activates the [[homing device]] in the heel of his left shoe; Leiter detects its signal and informs M of 007's whereabouts.
[[Image:HaroldSakata007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Odd job]]]]
On landing, Bond is imprisoned in the stud farm, where Goldfinger is meeting with representative U.S. mafiosi, who have delivered the operational materials he needs for Operation Grand Slam. In his cell, Bond overcomes his guard, escapes, and then spies on the gangster meeting, learning that Goldfinger intends to kill the soldiers of [[Fort Knox]] with Delta-9 nerve gas, and then (supposedly) steal the depository's gold; at lecture's end, a henchman gasses the gangsters. Goldfinger thus delivers a lecture to men he intends to immediately kill (he admits to Bond that he enjoyed doing so), just as lectured Bond on the operation of the laser when intending to kill him with it. 
[[Image:FortKnoxGoldVault.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Fort Knox]]]]
After the lecture, Bond manages to place a note on Goldfinger's plans, along with his small tracking device, in the pocket of an early-leaving gangster, Mr. Solo. However, this signal is lost when Solo is shot and killed in a car that is then crushed, with the gangster's cadaver inside, to a metal cube in an auto junkyard compactor. Meanwhile, Pussy Galore re-captures Bond and returns him to his cell, now guarded by several Koreans.

Later, Bond and Goldfinger discuss the practical details of Operation Grandslam; Bond notes that the gold's weight (10,500 tons) would take sixty men twelve days to load onto two hundred trucks. Meantime, the U.S. military would have plenty of time to stop the theft. Goldfinger tells Bond he does not intend to remove the gold, but instead plans to raid the depository long enough to place a "dirty" (cobalt and iodine) atomic bomb (see [[salted bomb]]) supplied by the Red Chinese government. The bomb would irradiate the U.S.'s gold supply, rendering it useless for fifty-eight years, multiplying the value of Goldfinger's gold supply at least tenfold. The ultimate purpose of this Communist plot is to disrupt the economy of the Western world.
[[Image:Gold8.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pussy Galore (James Bond)|Pussy Galore]]'s Flying Circus (''Goldfinger'', 1964)]] 
As Operation Grandslam begins, the women pilots of Pussy Galore's Flying Circus gas metropolitan Fort Knox, seemingly killing thousands of soldiers, civilians, and Felix Leiter and partner. 

All is not as it seems, however. Yet earlier, Bond had seduced Pussy Galore, unknowingly persuading her to contact the CIA, who have substituted a harmless gas in place of Delta-9. Goldfinger had deceived Galore to believe that Delta-9 was an anesthestic, not a nerve gas: she'd not planned mass murder and had even called the gas project ''Operation Rock-A-Bye-Baby''. Bond had told her the truth about Delta-9, seemingly at the time without effect, but later commented wryly that he must've "appealed to her maternal instincts." 

Goldfinger's communist Chinese destroy the depository's main gate with an explosive, then use the laser to cut their way into the vault building; Bond is handcuffed to the atomic bomb. Outside, the U.S. Army which had been faking death, revives to fight Goldfinger's communist forces; Goldfinger escapes the battle, disguised as a U.S. Army Colonel. In the vault, Bond fist-fights with and eventually kills Oddjob (whose lethal metal hat proves electrically fatal to him, as a conductor). Afterwards, Bond vainly tries to deactivate the atomic bomb; Leiter and an expert deactivate it seven seconds shy of detonation ‚Äî the timer indicates 007.
[[Image:GertFrobe007.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Gert Fr√∂be]] as the eponymous [[Auric Goldfinger]], impersonating a US Army officer appears on the jet]]

Later, Bond will meet the President for a personal, thank-you meeting; Bond's Washington, D.C.-bound flight in a [[business jet]] (again a [[Lockheed JetStar]], but military) is hijacked by Goldfinger and Pussy Galore, who are escaping to communist [[Cuba]]; Bond and Goldfinger struggle for the revolver which fires, shatters a window, and depressurises the cabin. Goldfinger is sucked out of the window. Before the jet crashes, James Bond and Pussy Galore parachute from it and safely land on a tropical beach, to catch up on their kissing under cover of the parachute canopy.

''Goldfinger'' is the first of three James Bond films with a theme song sung by [[Shirley Bassey]] - and her strong, brassy style became a thematic trademark. "[[Goldfinger (song)|Goldfinger]]" was written by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] and [[Anthony Newley]].  The song was produced by [[George Martin]], who was currently busy producing [[The Beatles]] during the hey-day of Beatlemania.  Originally, Newley recorded it, but it was re-recorded with Bassey's voice  for the film and the soundtrack. In 1992, Newley's version was later released in the 30th Anniversary of James Bond on film, in the compilation collectors edition ''[[The Best of Bond...James Bond]]''. Bassey's theme sold more than a million copies in the United States, earning a [[Gold album]] for her; in the United Kingdom, the theme song logged to number 21 in the charts.

The soundtrack score was composed by John Barry, marking this as his second, credited James Bond film score. The last four tracks went unreleased in the original soundtrack record, and were only first released in the 30th Anniversary compilation album, ''The Best of Bond ... James Bond''. In 2003, they were released in the remastered ''Goldfinger'' soundtrack album.

The score of this film exhibits consistant thematic features, including a general brassy sound, with regular metallic chime sounds which suggest the striking of metal, coins, or gold.

{{toomuchtrivia}}
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}
[[Image:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Aston Martin DB5]]
*[[Aston Martin DB5]] - This car is Bond's first company car in the films, and is equipped with a number of Q Branch's modifications (carried from adventure to adventure), including bulletproof front and rear wind screens, oil slick dispenser, smoke screen burner, front wing machine guns, rotating licence plates and a passenger ejector seat (again used in ''[[Die Another Day]]'', in an [[Aston Martin V12 Vanquish]]). The Aston Martin has appeared in four films: ''Goldfinger'' and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' starring Sean Connery, and ''[[GoldenEye]]'' and ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' starring Pierce Brosnan (discounting ''[[The World is Not Enough]]'', where the car scenes, bar a thermal satellite image, were cut). This silver-grey DB5 also was driven by [[George Lazenby]] in the 1983 television film ''[[The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.|The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair]]'', and by [[Roger Moore]] in the 1981 comedy ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'', it reappears in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006) starring [[Daniel Craig]]. This leaves [[Timothy Dalton]] as the only official James Bond not shown driving the DB5. A 1965 Aston Martin appears in the 2006 remake Bond film [[Casino Royale]].
*The wetsuit that doesn't wet. In 1964 there existed "dry suit"s which a diver could wear which would not allow any water into the suit, but a dry suit is distinguished by its rubber neck-seal, which the diver must poke a head through (see [[dry suit]]). No drysuit zips all the way to the neck, as Bond's "wetsuit" does. However, Bond's perfect white tuxedo is none the worse from water in the famous opening sequence of the film. 
*The Tilly Masterson character drives the then-new [[Ford Mustang]] in a duel with the gadget-equipped Aston Martin.
*Oddjob's steel-rimmed [[top hat]], thrown in the movie, notably, like a [[Frisbee]] (a toy that had its nominal debut in 1958). In the novel, the hat is a steel-rimmed [[bowler hat]].
*Goldfinger rides in a 1937 [[Rolls-Royce Phantom III]], famous in its own right from appearing in the film. Its licence number plate (AU 1) includes the letters "Au", the abbreviated chemical symbol for gold. The expiration sticker is for "AUG 64", another reference to gold (and the year of the film).
*Homer - Bond is issued two homing devices by Q Branch. The first, the larger, is used by Bond to track the villain's Rolls-Royce automobile to his base. The second is the smaller and allows [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] to track Bond's whereabouts; it is hidden in the secret compartment in the heel of one shoe. He later slips it onto the person of Mr. Solo who is taking his leave of Goldfinger's Fort Knox scheme; Bond hopes MI6 can then follow and capture Solo and question him about where he got the device. Unfortunately, the tracer is destroyed when Solo is murdered and his body crushed in a car-crusher along with the car he was in.
*The car-ferry airplane is an Aviation Traders [[Carvair]], an aircraft that was built for transporting automobiles and well-off passengers. Only 21 Carvairs were ever built and therefore it is relatively unknown. Modern viewers may not be surprised at this airplane, which may superficially appear from the nose-bulge to be the well-known 747. However the 747 was not conceived until 1965, and did not fly commercially until 1970. [http://home.clara.net/rod.beavon/7471.htm]
*Goldfinger's "private" jet. The first [[Lear Jet]] was still unsold when this film was released, and the [[Lockheed JetStar]] used in the movie as both Goldfinger's jet and the government's jet, was still very new, so the idea of a [[business jet]] or private jet was quite novel in 1964.
*The giant laser. Lasers did not exist in 1959 when the book was written, and they were a novelty in 1964 in the movie; this may be the first film appearance of the device (it is even referred to as an "industrial laser", which surely did not exist yet in 1964). The Bond set uses a scaled-up prop which visually suggests the original 1960 [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H. Maiman]] ruby-crystal laser, complete with coiled external flashlamp (see [[laser]] for history), and the beam is red. However, in the movie the laser beam is continuous, which is never the case with the 1960 flashlamp design. Reportedly the film prop actually used a low-powered helium-neon continuous beam [[gas laser]], but the beam didn't show on the film, so it had to be added as an optical special effect. The effect on the table is simulated by a welder cutting through it from below with an [[oxyacetylene]] torch.
*The Chinese atomic bomb. Communist China was known to be working on becoming a nuclear power in the early 1960s (despite Soviet withdrawal of such assistance in 1960), however, China did not detonate its first nuclear weapon until October, 1964 (see [[596 (nuclear test)]]), which occurred after this film's screenplay was written and its release ([[September 17]] [[1964]]). Thus, the Red Chinese atom bomb, like the industrial laser, is an expected, yet unrealised device, in this film.
*Although not shown on screen, a reference is made in dialogue to the [[attache case]] Bond used in ''From Russia with Love''. While aboard Goldfinger's jet, Bond asks for it and is told it was damaged upon examination, a reference to the anti-tamper device referenced in the previous film.

{{toomuchtrivia}}
[[Image:007Connery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sean Connery]] in ''Goldfinger'' promotional photo]]

* The villain's name was borrowed from Ian Fleming's neighbor, architect [[Ern≈ë Goldfinger]], and his character bears some resemblance. Erno Goldfinger consulted his lawyers when the book was published, prompting Fleming to suggest renaming the character "Goldprick", but Goldfinger eventually settled out of court in return for his legal costs, six copies of the novel, and an agreement that the character's first name 'Auric' would always be used.

* 'Goldfinger' is typically a German-Jewish name, and the protagonists of the novel know this, but neither Bond nor Mr. Du Pont think Goldfinger is Jewish. Instead, Bond pegs the red-haired, blue-eyed man as a Balt, and, indeed, Goldfinger proves an expatriate Latvian.

* In the film, Goldfinger‚Äôs ethnicity is Teutonic, given Gert Fr√∂be's heavy German accent (which required dubbing) and dyed red-blond hair. Fr√∂be was chosen as the villain because producers Saltzman and Broccoli had seen his performance in a German thriller titled '[[Es geschah am hellichten Tag]]' ('It happened in broad daylight', 1958), which is based on the story ''Das Versprechen'' (''The Pledge''), by [[Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt]]. In that film, Fr√∂be was a psychopathic serial killer named Schrott, who vents his frustrations with his dominating wife against children. Broccoli and Saltzman had seen the movie and decided upon the 'big bad German' for the role. In the film, a new Goldfinger fascination with Nazi gold history is revealed when Bond tempts him to betting high stakes against a lost, historical Nazi gold bar, an incident not in the novel (the golf game is merely for a large amount of cash).

* All of this didn't help when the film was temporarily banned in [[Israel]] due to Gert Fr√∂be's connections with the actual [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]]. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a [[Jewish]] family publicly thanked Fr√∂be for protecting them from persecution during [[World War II]].

* The title song "Goldfinger" was produced by [[George Martin]].  Martin is known for his production work with [[The Beatles]] and has earned the title of the "fifth Beatle".  During the time of Goldfinger, Martin was busy producing songs which would define the British Invasion and already had twenty-three US top 20 hits - 'Goldfinger' would be his twenty-fourth.  Martin would imitate many of John Barry's 007 scores the following year while composing the instrumental soundtrack to [[The Beatles]] film "Help!".  In 1973, Martin returned to the 007 franchise to not only produce the title song for [[Live and Let Die]], but arrange the films musical score.  Furthermore, it was Martin who originally brought fame to [[From Russia With Love]] singer [[Matt Monro]] by asking him to record for EMI in 1960.

* The novel identifies Goldfinger as a [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] operative; in the film he is an independent operator working with Communist [[China]], and thus the first major Bond movie villain unaffiliated with [[SPECTRE]].

* Ian Fleming wrote the novel on which the movie ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' is based, and there are many connections between the films (see "The Bond Connection" in ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)]]''). These include the use of [[Gert Fr√∂be]] in both films, and the fact that both movies feature techno-magical cars.

*Production Designer [[Ken Adam]] incorporated further exotic devices into the Aston Martin, including a mobile telephone, though the producers rejected this as too outlandish (despite that one was used on Bond's Bentley in the earlier film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]''). 

* In the novel, Goldfinger has a yellow-jacketed pornographic book and gold-painted prostitutes, golden food and drink, a yellow-painted car, a blonde secretary, and even a ginger-colored cat (eaten by Oddjob for dinner after Bond uses it in a ruse). He employs Korean servants repeatedly referred to as "yellow-faced." The film keeps the color of the automobile and the secretary‚Äôs hair, but not the racially insensitive material (although Oddjob and many henchmen remain Korean). In compensation, the film has many similar motifs: Goldfinger's red-blond hair; the henchwomen are either red-blonde or blonde (including all of Pussy Galore‚Äôs pilots) save Goldfinger's Asian personal jet stewardess Mei-Lei (Tilly and Pussy have black hair in the novel). Goldfinger sports yellow and golden clothing in every scene, including a gold pistol, when disguised as a U.S. Army colonel. (Technically, this makes Goldfinger the first [[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|"man with the golden gun"]] in a Bond film.) The factory henchmen wear yellow sashes, Pussy and Mai-Lei wear metallic gold vests, and the pilots wear yellow sunburst stars. Goldfinger's homage to gold ("I love its color, its brilliance, its divine heaviness.") is one of few dialogue lines from the novel retained relatively intact in the film.

* Ian Fleming himself liked the color of gold enough to own a gold-plated typewriter, on which he wrote some Bond novels. In the mid-1990s this machine was purchased by the fifth official Bond actor, [[Pierce Brosnan]], in Jamaica.[http://www.freedownloadsoft.com/info/ian-fleming.html] 

* The gold-painted girl in the opening credits is actually [[Margaret Nolan]], who plays Dink, Bond's Miami masseuse.

* [[Theodore Bikel]], who played Capt. Von Trapp in the original Broadway version of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', screen-tested for the role of Goldfinger.

* Scenes from the film are shown during the opening credits sequence, although footage from the helicopter chase in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' and the explosion on Crab Key from ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' are also featured. This is also the first opening credit sequence to show the face of the actor playing James Bond; this would not happen again until ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.

* For an unknown reason Jill and Tilly's surname was changed from Master'''t'''on to Master'''s'''on for the film.

* Sean Connery never traveled to the United States to film this movie. Bond's American scenes were filmed in Pinewood Studios,  London. The scene where Bond pushes ''down'' the light switch to turn ''on'' his suite's light, discovering the dead, golden Jill, is an English light switch on an English soundstage.

* The film's opening teaser sequence is based on the novel's opening where Bond is in the Miami Airport lounge thinking about his recent killing of a drug smuggler.

* The iconic slow aerial shot that follows the opening credits is that of the [[Fontainebleau Hotel]] in [[Miami Beach]], which still stands. The big band piece accompanying the shot is John Barry's "Into Miami."

* [[Jack Lord]] initially was slated to reprise the Felix Leiter role, originated in the first James Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.  Different stories abound as to why he was replaced at the last minute, by [[Cec Linder]], ranging from Lord demanding more money and equal billing with Connery to schedule conflicts, to the producers not wanting Lord back as Leiter, concerned he might upstage Connery.  The next actor to play Felix Leiter in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', [[Rik Van Nutter]], took on  an appearance that more resembled Jack Lord's in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.

* The golf club scene was shot at Stoke Poges Golf Club in [[Buckinghamshire]]. When Oddjob decapitates the statue, the statue's head falls onto its arm, causing it to move and miraculously reposition. Later, when Bond switches on his car's radar scanner, the Golf Club's actual location is correctly show on the screen.

* Concerned about censors, the film's producers thought about changing Pussy Galore's name to "Kitty Galore". They kept the original name when British newspapers began to refer to Honor Blackman as "Pussy" in the lead up to production. Pussy's name is actually connected to her leadership of a circus group of cat-burglar, cat-women Amazon lesbian acrobats (called "abrocats") in the novel, but that connection, and other complications, did not survive to the screen adaptation.  Although Pussy's sexual preferences are hinted at by a line to Bond ("You can turn off the charm. I'm immune".) and her initial resistance to Bond's sexual advances, especially in the barn, it is never stated she is lesbian in the film. Similarly, Bond's original response when Pussy introduces herself ("Yes I know, but what's your name?") was changed to "I must be dreaming!" to avoid censorship.

* In Goldfinger's jet, he asks stewardess, Mei-Lei, for his attach√© case, which she reports "destroyed on examination," a reference to the armed attach√© case issued to Bond in the previous film, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]''.

* Ian Fleming also contributed to the original draft screenplay for ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' television series, in which one of the heroes was named "Napoleon Solo". That name originally came from the novel: Napoleon Solo is one of the crime bosses Goldfinger invites to participate in his scheme to steal the gold from Fort Knox. However, the character appearing in the film is a gangster referred to only as "Mr. Solo" (coincidentally "Mr. Solo" was a working title for ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.''); he exits the story due to "a pressing engagement." In the film he is shot in his car and taken to a junkyard and crushed in a [[Compactor|car compactor]].

* Ford Motor Company supplied the 1964 model [[Lincoln Continental]] for the compactor scene (much anguishing American audiences), in return for the film's showcase of the new [[Ford Mustang]] in the Swiss mountain road sequence; astute viewers, however, will see that a 1963 Lincoln Continental was used in the compaction sequence (the 1963 Lincoln Continental's V8 engine was removed). The differences visible on film are hub cap styles and the rear passenger window frames that are squared off at the side panels on the 1964 model (most visible as Solo enters the car), but are rounded off on the 1963 model (clearly visible as the crane lift comes down upon it during the compaction sequence). Not visible, however, are the wheelbase changes from the 1963's 123 inches that were increased to 126 inches for the 1964 production year at Ford's Lincoln division. There are other Ford product placements in the film. During the crushing of the car, the crew remained silent, awed by what they were doing. A [[Ford Thunderbird]] serves as the vehicle for Felix Leiter while tailing Bond in Louisville, Kentucky.

* In order to simulate the sound of crumpling metal in compactor, sound effects editor Norman Wanstall used the noise of crumpling beer cans. The film has the compactor car-cube returned to Goldfinger so he can "separate" his gold from the "late Mr. Solo." Oddjob has a pickup truck (a 1964 [[Ford Falcon]] [[Ranchero]]) available to remove the compacted cube, so there is a plan to return the cube to Goldfinger. There, Goldfinger tells Bond he must now separate his gold from the late Mr. Solo, but this scene's purpose appears to be to give Bond a chance to pun on Solo's "pressing engagement." The audience is not supposed to notice that Goldfinger could have saved himself the whole problem, by simply having Oddjob remove the briefcase of gold bullion before the car is crushed. (Note the gold weight is ignored here as well: it would be possible to carry $1 million in gold bullion in a suitcase at today's prices, but wouldn't have been possible, even for Oddjob, at any exchange rate from 1964). 

* In the end sequence, when the atomic bomb is defused, the original ending countdown shown was "003" seconds remaining to detonation. When the film was released in the U.S., the producers changed it to 007 seconds, but the dialogue line remained: "''Three'' more ticks and Mr. Goldfinger would have hit the jackpot". Of course, the timer actually clicked more than once per real-time second, so it could have actually been around three more seconds to detonation.

* For security reasons, the filmmakers were not allowed to film inside [[Fort Knox]]. All sets for the interior of Fort Knox were designed and built from scratch.  However, a letter from a real-life Fort Knox controller complimented Ken Adam and the production team on their vivid imaginations. The three-dimensional scale-model outdoor map Goldfinger used during his mission briefing, is currently displayed at Fort Knox.

* Script co-writer [[Paul Dehn]] would later be hired to write most of the entries in the ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' film franchise, in part due to his work on ''Goldfinger''. 

* Fleming visited the set of ''Goldfinger'', but died in 1964 shortly before it was released, so he never saw the film.

==In popular culture==
* In [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]], in one episode, when Will meets his new teacher, he shouts, "OoooH! Were you the bad guy in Goldfinger?!"

* In the English [[Trip Hop]] group [[Sneaker Pimps]], the track "Golden Girl" was sampled on their 1996 song "[[6 Underground]]".

* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer to the Max]]," Homer sings a song to the tune of the "Goldfinger" title song (with similar lyrics) when he introduces himself to his family as "Max Power."

*In another ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode, "[[You Only Move Twice]]", the scene with Bond and the laser is parodied.

==''Mythbusters''==
Two controversial incidents in this film have been subjected to special examination by [[Discovery Channel]]'s program ''[[MythBusters]]'': skin asphyxiation and bullet-induced airplane explosive decompression. 

====Asphyxiation argument====
[[Image:LifeGoldfinger.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Life (magazine)|Life]] cover: ''Goldfinger'']]

In one scene, the villain's girlfriend, Jill Masterson, is murdered by "skin suffocation." She is painted with gold paint and dies because her [[skin]] is unable to breathe. According to [[urban legend]], the concept was based on the death of a Swiss fashion model who painted herself and asphyxiated. Another urban legend in Europe involved Italian children who were painted gold as part of a religious parade, and died.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

''[[MythBusters]]'' has twice attempted to prove or disprove whether skin suffocation due to paint was possible. In both experiments one of the hosts of the series was covered head-to-toe in gold paint. The first experiment was called off when the subject began experiencing breathing and blood pressure problems. In a follow-up experiment, a different subject was covered but this time showed no ill effects. The series' conclusion was that if one did try murder via gilding, the victim would die of [[heat stroke]], but only after a long period and not in the manner shown in the movie. The gold paint would clog the pores and prevent [[perspiration]], rendering the body unable to properly regulate its temperature. Dying in this fashion, however, would take several days and is a very inefficient manner of killing.

===Explosive decompression airplane window argument===
In a 2003 episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'', the mythbusters attempted to recreate a scene in several movies (including ''Goldfinger'') in which a window in a jet at high altitude is broken by a bullet, resulting in a passenger being sucked through the window hole by the force of the decompression. The popular idea that this was a realistic possibility almost certainly{{Fact|date=February 2007}} dates from the Goldfinger book and film (Bond in the film claims a .45 bullet fired at 35,000 feet will cause people to be sucked into "outer space"), and it had settled into the national consciousness firmly enough to be mentioned in the 1970 film ''[[Airport (film)|Airport]]'' (where a character tells of seeing this happen). 

''MythBusters''' attempted a recreation of the phenomenon by over-pressurizing a commercial airliner sitting on the ground to a differential of 8 p.s.i. (the normal pressure difference between inside and outside a commercial airliner at cruising altitude), then firing a handgun at the window. They were unable to re-create any kind of window blowout or sudden cabin decompression, using a firearm (instead, a small hole merely appeared in the plastic). Even when explosives were used to blow a window out entirely, a dummy passenger near the window stayed in the cabin. A claim was later made by the ''MythBusters'' team in a ''[[Skeptic Magazine]]'' interview, that the U.S. government had sought data from this particular segment, since federal agencies and their contractors had been seriously contemplating the same sort of tests, in relation to its armed sky-marshal program, after the events of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The tests found that 737 airliner windows apparently do not behave in the same way as the window in the [[Lockheed JetStar]] used to represent a jet at 35,000 ft in the film.
