'''''The Lion King''''' is a [[1994 in film|1994]] [[United States|American]] [[animated feature]] film produced by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], released in theaters on [[June 15]], [[1994]] by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 32nd film in the [[List of Disney animated features|Disney animated feature]] canon. The film was the highest grossing animated film of all time before the release of ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', a [[Disney/Pixar]] film released nearly a decade later that would overshadow the record of ''The Lion King''. Despite this, it still holds the record as the highest grossing hand-drawn animated film in history. 

The story, influenced by the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] plays ''[[Hamlet]]'' and [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]] and Disney's 1942 classic ''[[Bambi]]'', focuses on a young [[lion]] in [[Africa]] named [[Simba]], who learns of his place in the great "circle of life" and overcomes many obstacles to claim his place as the rightful king.

A musical film, ''The Lion King'' garnered two [[Academy Award]]s for its achievement in music. Songs were written by composer [[Elton John]] and lyricist [[Tim Rice]], with an original score by [[Hans Zimmer]].<ref name="boxofficemojo">{{cite web | work=boxofficemojo.com- 1994 Academy Awards | title=''The Lion King'' - 1994 Academy Awards |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/oscar/movies/?id=lionking.htm| accessdaymonth=17 September |accessyear=2006}}</ref> Disney later produced two related movies: a [[sequel]], ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]''; and a part [[Sequel#Prequel|prequel]]/part [[Sequel#Midquel|midquel]], ''[[The Lion King 1½]]''. This movie belongs to the successful period known as [[Modern animation of the United States#The Return of Disney|Disney Renaissance]].

==Story==
''The Lion King'' takes place in the fictional Pride Lands of Africa, where a [[lion]] rules over the other animals as king. At the beginning of the film, [[Rafiki]], a wise old [[mandrill]] [[shaman]], (commonly mistaken as a [[baboon]]), anoints [[Simba]], the newborn cub of King [[Mufasa]] and Queen [[Sarabi]], and presents him to a massive gathering of animals at Pride Rock ("[[Circle of Life]]"). Meanwhile, Mufasa's younger brother, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], realizes that he is no longer the heir to the throne and plots to kill Mufasa and Simba in order to usurp it.
 
When Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa takes him on a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him about the Circle of Life, the delicate balance affecting all living things, which the king must maintain. The tour is cut short when Mufasa's adviser, the [[hornbill]] [[Zazu]], alerts him of [[hyena]] sightings in the Pride Lands, and Mufasa sends a disappointed Simba home while he deals with the threat. Back at Pride Rock, Scar piques Simba's curiosity about the [[elephant's graveyard|elephant graveyard]], a place beyond the northern borders of the Pride Lands, where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba, trying to prove his courage, takes his best friend [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]] to the elephant graveyard, fooling Zazu along the way ("[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]"). At the graveyard, the cubs are greeted by [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed]], Scar's hyena minions who attempt to kill the cubs. Fortunately, they are rescued by Mufasa at the nick of time.
 
Mufasa scolds Simba on the way home and orders Zazu to escort Nala back to Pride Rock, and explains to Simba that being brave doesn't mean looking for trouble. When Simba asks if his father will always be with him, Mufasa tells his son that the great kings of the past watch from the stars, just as he will watch over Simba one day when the sun sets on his time. Meanwhile, Scar becomes furious, as he intended for the hyenas to kill the cubs. Plotting further, Scar gathers more hyenas and buys their loyalty by claiming that if he becomes king, they'll never go hungry again ("[[Be Prepared (song)|Be Prepared]]").

[[Image:YoungSimbaSmilestlk.png|250px|thumb|left|[[Simba]], meeting Timon and Pumbaa.]]

Some time later, Scar lures Simba into a gorge for a "surprise from his father," while the hyenas engineer a [[wildebeest]] stampede down into the gorge where Simba is. Alerted by an insincerely dramatic Scar, Mufasa races to rescue his son from the stampede. Mufasa successfully saves his son, but struggles to bring himself to safety. As Mufasa helplessly clings on to a steep cliff, he asks Scar for help, but Scar flings his brother into the raging stampede below, after mocking him with the words "long live the king." Simba, who sees his father fall, (but not the reason for the fall) rushes down to his father's body, and tries to wake up the dead king to no avail. An approaching Scar convinces Simba that the young cub was responsible for his father's death, and recommends that he flee the Pride Lands, never to return. As Simba is running off, Scar sends his hyena henchmen to kill Simba again, but as Simba flees through a thornbush-covered embankment, the hyenas break off pursuit and let him escape. Hurling threats that he will be killed if ever seen again, the hyenas return to Scar and lie that they have murdered the cub. Informed that both Mufasa and Simba were killed, the pride regretfully allows Scar to assume the throne as the closest of kin. Still mourning, they are told the hyenas are now part of the pride.

In a distant desert Simba is found unconcscious by [[Timon and Pumbaa]], a comical [[meerkat]]-[[warthog]] duo who adopt and raise the cub under their carefree "[[Hakuna Matata]]" lifestyle. When Simba has grown into an adult, he is discovered by his childhood friend Nala, who relays that Scar's tyrannical reign has devastated the Pride Lands, turning it into a barren wasteland. She asks Simba to return and take his rightful place as king, but Simba refuses, still guilty about supposedly causing his father's death. 

Simba then shows Nala around and they find themselves in love ("[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]"). But immediately afterwards, Nala tells Simba that she doesn't understand why he won't return to Pride Rock. The two become angry, confused, and end up in a quarrel. However, Rafiki shows up and indirectly persuades Simba to return home with a series of metaphors. Combined with an appearance of the ghost of Mufasa, Simba realizes his responsibility and heads back to Pride Rock, followed by Timon, Pumbaa and Nala.

Once back at Pride Rock, Simba is shocked finding out how true Nala's description of how the once-majestic kingdom he remembered turned out to be. Convinced of what must be done, he decides to find Scar, encouraging Timon and Pumba to distract the hyenas and Nala to rally the lionesses. Meanwhile, after seeing his mother struck by Scar for criticizing him, Simba steps in. A bewildered Scar falsely believes that Mufasa has come back. However, Simba has announced his return to his battered mother, while confronting Scar. Afraid of losing the throne, Scar announces to the pride that Simba was responsible for Mufasa's death. He then corners Simba at the edge of Pride Rock with his hyenas, resulting in a scene similar to Mufasa's death. At the same time, lightning strikes the dry brush, surrounding Pride Rock with flames. As Simba dangles over the edge of Pride Rock with flames below him, an over-confident Scar reveals the truth about Mufasa's death. Enraged, Simba leaps up and pins Scar to the ground, forcing him to admit his wrongdoings. A fierce battle between the lionesses and the hyenas ensues. Rafiki, Zazu, Timon, and Pumbaa join the fray as well.

Atop Pride Rock's peak, Simba finally corners Scar. Attempting to gain Simba's mercy, Scar tries to surreptitiously blame everything on the hyenas, but Shenzi, Banzai and Ed overhear this betrayal. Simba demands that Scar [[exile|leave the Pride Lands and never return]], like Scar told Simba to do years earlier. Scar pretends to leave, but promptly attacks Simba, resulting in a violent final duel. Simba triumphs over his uncle by kicking him over a low cliff. Scar manages to survive and staggers to his paws, but finds himself surrounded by the now resentful hyenas. The hyenas approach their fallen leader and devour him alive, just as everything is seemingly enveloped by the fire.

A downpour extinguishes the brushfire, however, and Simba subsequently reconciles with his family. Rafiki then directs Simba to Pride Rock's overlook with the words "it is time". As Simba reaches the top of the overlook, he see the stars shining down on him and hears the voice of his father booming, "Remember..." Emboldened, Simba roars to signify that he is now king of the Pride Lands. With Simba and Nala as the new king and queen, the Pride Lands become green with life again. The movie concludes with Rafiki lifting Simba and Nala's newborn cub high into the air for all the animals to see, thus continuing the circle of life.

==Production==
''The Lion King'' was originally called ''King of the Jungle'' during early stages of production.<ref name="kingofthejungle">{{cite web | work=The Lion King (1994) | title=The Lion King (1994) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/| accessdaymonth=12 September |accessyear=2006}}</ref> As in the case of the earlier film ''[[Bambi]]'', animators studied real-life animals for reference, and some of the filmmakers went to [[Kenya]] to observe the natural habitat that would be shown in the film.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, (2003) Disc 2, 'Production Research Trip'</ref>

The film's significant use of computers helped the filmmakers to present their vision in new ways. The most notable use of [[computer animation]] is in the "wildebeest stampede" sequence. Several distinct wildebeest characters were built in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Similar multiplication occurs in the "Be Prepared" musical number with identical marching hyenas.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, (2003) Disc 2, 'Computer Animation'</ref>

''The Lion King'' was once considered a secondary project to ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', both of which were in production at the same time. Most of the Disney Feature Animation staff preferred to work on ''Pocahontas'', believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, (2003) Disc 2, 'Origins'</ref> While both films were commercial successes,''The Lion King'' received a greater amount of positive feedback and larger grosses than ''Pocahontas''.<ref name="rottentomatoestlk">{{cite web | work=Rotten Tomatoes | title=Rotten Tomatoes - The Lion King |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/| accessdaymonth=24 September |accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="rottentomatoespocahontas">{{cite web | work=Rotten Tomatoes | title=Rotten Tomatoes - ''Pocahontas'' |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/| accessdaymonth=17 September |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The main locations for the film, including Pride Rock and the Gorge, are modeled after [[Hell's Gate National Park]] in [[Kenya]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/trivia The Lion King (1994) - Trivia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
This animated film was created and recorded at a studio in [[Burbank, California]].

Months prior to the film's release, the [[Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Chief Operating Officer]] [[Frank Wells]] died in a helicopter crash. A statement in remembrance of Wells was added to the beginning of the film as a result.

==Reaction==
''The Lion King'' garnered critical acclaim, and currently has a 92% "fresh" rating at [[RottenTomatoes.com]].<ref name="rottentomatoestlk">{{cite web | work=Rotten Tomatoes | title=Rotten Tomatoes - The Lion King |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/| accessdaymonth=24 September |accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called the film "a superbly drawn animated feature"<ref name="tlkebertreview">{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | work=Chicago Sun Times| title=The Lion King review|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940624/REVIEWS/406240301/1023| accessdaymonth=31 August |accessyear=2006}}</ref> in his print review. However, on the program ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel & Ebert]]'' the film received a mixed reaction from [[Gene Siskel]] and Roger Ebert, despite a "Thumbs Up" from both critics.

''The Lion King'' became the highest grossing motion picture of 1994 worldwide, and the second highest in the USA (the first being ''[[Forrest Gump (film)|Forrest Gump]]'').<ref name="movies">{{cite web | work= movies.com | title=Highest grossing movies of 1994 |url=http://movies.go.com/boxoffice?cat=1994| accessdaymonth=18 September |accessyear=2006}}</ref>  The film initially made [[United States dollar|US$]]312,855,561 domestically, but including its 2002 [[IMAX]] re-release the domestic amount totaled to $328,541,776.

It held the record for the most successful animated feature film in history until that record was broken by the computer animated ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' in 2003. ''[[Shrek 2]]'' further surpassed ''Nemo'''s gross in 2004, but ''The Lion King'' still remains the most successful non-[[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animated feature. When adjusted for inflation, it is the fourth top-grossing animated film (below ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' and ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'').

===Awards===
The film won two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Original Song]] ("[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]"). Besides winning in the same two categories in the [[Golden Globe Awards]], it also won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy]]. In the [[Annie Awards]], it won Best Animated Film, Best Individual Achievement for Story Contribution in the Field of Animation, and [[Jeremy Irons]] also won Best Achievement for Voice Acting for voicing Scar.<ref name="awards">{{cite web | work=The Internet Movie Database | title= ''The Lion King'' awards|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/awards| accessdaymonth=27 August |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In June 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] revealed its "Ten top Ten"—the best ten films in ten "classic" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. ''The Lion King'' was acknowledged as the fourth best film in the animation genre.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 | date = [[2008-06-17]] | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/animation.html | accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref>

==Music==
[[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]] wrote five original songs for this film, with Elton John performing "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" during the end credits. [[Hans Zimmer]] also contributed to the film a score supplemented with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by [[Lebo M]].<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, (2003) Disc 2, 'Music: African Influence'</ref>  The film won Best Original Score and Best Original Song ("[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]") in both the [[Academy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Awards]].<ref name="awards">{{cite web | work=The Internet Movie Database | title= ''The Lion King'' awards|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/awards| accessdaymonth=27 August |accessyear=2006}}</ref> Three songs from the film were nominated simultaneously for the [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Original Song Academy Award]] ("[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]", "[[Circle of Life]]" and "[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]"), with "Circle of Life" also being nominated simultaneously in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|same category at the Golden Globe Awards]].<ref name="hfpa">{{cite web | work=HFPA| title= Golden Globe Awards|url=http://www1.hfpa.org/browse/film/25384| accessdaymonth=8 November |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Songs===
These are the musical numbers of the film, listed in order of appearance.

*'''"[[Circle of Life]]"''' is sung by an off-screen [[Carmen Twillie (actress)| Carmen Twillie]], with African vocals by [[Lebo M]] and his African choir. This song is played during the ceremony where a newborn Simba is presented to the animals of the Pride Lands. The song is reprised at the end of the film, during the presentation of Simba and Nala's newborn cub.
*'''"The Morning Report"''', a song originally not in the film (it was created for the live musical version), was added with an accompanying animated sequence in the 2003 Platinum Edition home video re-release. Sung by [[Zazu]] ([[Jeff Bennett]]), [[Mufasa]] ([[James Earl Jones]]) and young [[Simba]] (Evan Saucedo), the song is an extension of the scene in the original film where Zazu delivers a morning report to Mufasa, and later gets pounced on by Simba. 
*'''"[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]"''' is sung by young Simba ([[Jason Weaver]]), young Nala (Laura Williams), and Zazu ([[Rowan Atkinson]]). Simba uses this musical number in the film to distract Zazu so that he and Nala can sneak off to the elephant graveyard, while expressing his wish to be king as soon as possible.
*'''"[[Be Prepared (The Lion King song)|Be Prepared]]"''' is sung by Scar ([[Jeremy Irons]]/[[Jim Cummings]]), [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Shenzi|Shenzi]] ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Banzai|Banzai]] ([[Cheech Marin]]) and [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Ed|Ed]] (Jim Cummings). In this song, Scar reveals to his hyena minions his plot to kill Mufasa and Simba.
*'''"[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]"''' is sung by [[Timon and Pumbaa|Timon]] ([[Nathan Lane]]), [[Timon and Pumbaa|Pumbaa]] ([[Ernie Sabella]]) and Simba (Jason Weaver as a cub and [[Joseph Williams]] as an adult). Timon and Pumbaa use this song as a warm welcome to Simba as he arrives at their jungle home, and to symbolize their "no worries" lifestyle. The song encompasses a [[montage]] sequence during which Simba grows into a young adult.
*'''"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]"''' is a love song sung mainly by an off-screen Kristle Edwards, with Timon (Nathan Lane), Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), adult Simba (Joseph Williams) and adult Nala ([[Sally Dworsky]]). This musical sequence shows Timon and Pumbaa's frustration at Simba falling in love, and the development of Simba and Nala's romantic relationship. The song won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for Best Original Song during the [[67th Academy Awards]].

=== Soundtrack and other albums ===
{{main|The Lion King (soundtrack)}}

The film's original motion picture soundtrack was released on [[July 13]], [[1994]].

On [[February 28]] [[1995]], Disney released an album entitled ''[[Rhythm of the Pride Lands]]'', a sequel of sorts to the original soundtrack which featured songs and performances inspired by, but not featured in, the film. Most of the tracks were composed by African composer Lebo M and focused primarily on the African influences of the film's original music, with most songs being sung either partially or entirely in various African languages. Several songs featured in the album would later have incarnations in other ''The Lion King''-oriented projects, such as the stage musical or the direct-to-video sequels (examples being "He Lives In You" used as the opening song for ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride''; and a reincarnation of "Warthog Rhapsody", called "That's All I Need", in ''The Lion King 1½''). ''Rhythm of the Pride Lands'' was initially printed in a very limited quantity. However, it was re-released in 2003 and included in some international versions of ''The Lion King'''s special edition soundtrack with an additional track.

Additionally, an allegedly long-lost "Lion King Expanded Score" containing never-before-released instrumental music from Hans Zimmer's original score has been available on [[eBay]].

==Sequels and spin-offs==
The success of the film led to several spin-offs, the first being a 70mm film released in 1995 entitled ''[[Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable]]''. It promoted environmental friendliness and was shown in the Harvest Theater in [[The Land (Disney)|The Land Pavilion]] at [[Epcot]] in [[Walt Disney World]]. Also debuted in 1995 was a spin-off television series called ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa]]'' which focused on the titular meerkat and warthog duo in a more modern, human world than the film's.

In addition, a [[direct-to-video]] sequel called ''[[The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride]]'' was released in 1998, focusing on Simba and his daughter Kiara as she falls in love with Kovu, a former member of Scar's pride. Finally, a direct-to-video [[prequel]]/midquel, ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' (also known as ''The Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata''), was released in 2004, showing the timeline of ''The Lion King'' from the perspective of Timon and Pumbaa as well as some background on these two characters.

Several characters from The Lion King including Timon, Pumbaa, Simba, Nala, Rafiki, Zazu, Shenzi, Banzai, Ed, Scar and Mufasa appear in the [[Disney Channel]] series, [[House of Mouse]].  Simba, Nala, Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki and Zazu also appear in the movie [[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]].  Shenzi, Banzai and Ed also appear in the movie [[Mickey's House of Villains]]. Simba and Nala also make a quick appearance.

==Home video==
''The Lion King'' was first released on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]] in the [[United States]] on [[March 3]] [[1995]], under [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s "[[Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection|Masterpiece Collection]]" video series. The VHS tape quickly became one of the best-selling videotapes of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day.<ref name="homevideosellingfigures">{{cite web | work=ComingSoon.Net | title=''The Lion King'' home video selling figures|url=http://comingsoon.net/news.php?id=1818| accessdaymonth=7 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive lithograph of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative "Circle of Life" epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV show ''The Making of The Lion King'', and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and ''The Making of The Lion King'', but also included storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition did not have, on a total of four double sided disks. These home video versions of ''The Lion King'' all went into [[moratorium (entertainment)|moratorium]] in 1997.<ref name="homevideoinfo">{{cite web | work=Lionking.org | title=TLK on Home Video|url=http://www.lionking.org/homevideo.html| accessdaymonth=24 September |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On [[October 7]] [[2003]], the film was re-released on VHS and released on DVD for the first time as ''The Lion King: Platinum Edition'', as part of Disney's [[Platinum Edition]] line of animated classic DVDs. The DVD release featured two versions of the film on the first disc, a remastered version created for the [[2002]] [[IMAX]] release and the original 1994 theatrical version.  A second disc with bonus features was also featured on the DVD release.  The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, one of the first Disney DVDs to do so.<ref name="DVDfeatures">{{cite web | work=disney.go.com | title=''The Lion King'' Special Edition DVD features|url=http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/moviefinder/products/3038703.html#details| accessdaymonth=18 September |accessyear=2006}}</ref> By means of [[seamless branching]], the film could be viewed either with or without a newly-created scene — a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song, "The Morning Report". A Special Collector's Gift Set was also released, with the DVD set, five exclusive lithographed character portraits (new sketches created and signed by the original character animators), and an introductory book entitled ''The Journey''.<ref name="homevideoinfo">{{cite web | work=Lionking.org | title=TLK on Home Video|url=http://www.lionking.org/homevideo.html| accessdaymonth=24 September |accessyear=2006}}</ref> More than two million copies of the Platinum Edition DVD and VHS units were sold on the first day of release.<ref name="homevideosellingfigures">{{cite web | work=ComingSoon.Net | title=''The Lion King'' home video selling figures|url=http://comingsoon.net/news.php?id=1818| accessdaymonth=7 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> A DVD boxed set of the three ''The Lion King'' films (in two-disc Special Edition formats) was released on [[December 6]] [[2004]].

The Platinum Edition of ''The Lion King'' was criticized by fans mainly for its false advertising: producer [[Don Hahn]] had earlier stated that the film would be in its original 1994 theatrical version, but it was confirmed after release that it was the "digitally enhanced" IMAX version instead, which is slightly different than the original theatrical cut. One of the most noticeable differences features re-drawn [[crocodiles]] in the "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" sequence.<ref name="dvddifferences">{{cite web | work=UltimateDisney.com | title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition DVD Review (Page 2) which shows the differences between the film presented on the DVD and the original theatrical cut|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/thelionking2.html| accessdaymonth=23 August |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Although Disney has not announced a date for a [[Blu-ray Disc]] re-release of ''The Lion King'' yet, the studio has publicly shown clips of the film on Blu-ray at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2008.<ref>[http://www.blu-ray.com/ces2008/ Blu-ray.com - CES 2008 Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.blu-ray.com/images/ces2008/lion1.jpg</ref>

== Controversies ==
===Story origin===
[[Image:Kimbasimba.JPG|thumb|290px|left|Comparison of ''Kimba the White Lion'' (left) and ''The Lion King'' on pride rock (right).]]
{{main|Kimba the White Lion#The Lion King controversy}}
''The Lion King'' was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story, rather than being based on an already-existing story. However, elements of the film bear a resemblance to a famous 1960s [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] [[television]] show, ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]''.<ref name="Kimba">{{cite web | work=Kimbawlion.com | title=Comparison screen-shots of ''The Lion King'' and ''Kimba the White Lion''|url=http://www.kimbawlion.com/rant2.htm| accessdaymonth=7 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> One similarity between the two is that the protagonists' names (Kimba and Simba) are very similar&mdash;although the word "simba" means "lion" in [[Swahili]].<ref>As shown in a search for either term at [http://africanlanguages.com/swahili/ Online Swahili - English Dictionary].</ref> Other parallels include that most characters in ''Kimba'' have an analogue in ''The Lion King'' and that various individual scenes are nearly identical in composition and camera angle. Early production artwork on the film's Platinum Edition DVD even depicts a white lion, but later it was found to be Taka, a lion that was to be in the film but was cut short. <ref name="kimbarant"> 'Presentation Reel' extra on the Lion King Platinum Edition DVD</ref> Disney's official stance is that any resemblance is coincidental, and directors [[Roger Allers]] and [[Rob Minkoff]] stated that they were well into the development process before the ''Kimba'' similarity was identified. Despite the controversy, the family of [[Osamu Tezuka]], ''Kimba'''s creator, has not filed a lawsuit, mostly cause "The Lion King" was based off more of the play "Hamlet" than "Kimba".

The character designs and scenes are the only things that have been speculated to be taken from Kimba; the two's stories are rather different from each other. The filmmakers, however, did say that the story of ''The Lion King'' was inspired by the [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]] stories from the [[Bible]], and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref name="storyinspiration">{{cite video | people = Don Hahn, Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2)  | medium = DVD  | publisher = Walt Disney Home Video  | date=  2003}}</ref> [[Christopher Vogler]], in his book ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers]]'', described Disney's request that he suggest how to improve the plot of ''The Lion King'' by incorporating ideas from ''Hamlet''.<ref name="mythicstructure">{{cite book | last=Vogler | first=Christopher | title=''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers'' | date=1998}}</ref>

The plot is also noted as sharing some striking elements with the [[West Africa]]n [[Epic of Sundiata]].<ref>[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED386732&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED386732 The True Lion King of Africa: The Epic History of Sundiata, King of Old Mali.]</ref>

===Alleged subliminal messaging===
[[Image:Lionkg2.jpg|thumb|right|The supposed "SEX" frame]]
[[Image:LionKingX.JPG|thumb|right|Alleged "SEX" frame modified with outlining]]
In one scene of the film's original VHS and LaserDisc releases, it appears that the word "SEX" was embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops down,<ref name="The "SEX" frame">{{cite web | work=Snopes|title=The alleged "SEX" frame in ''The Lion King''|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/lionking.htm| accessdaymonth=1 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> which conservative activist [[Donald Wildmon]] asserted was a [[subliminal message]] intended to promote [[sexual promiscuity]]. However, the films' [[animator]]s have stated that the letters spell "SFX" (a common abbreviation of "special effects"), and was a sort of innocent "signature" signed by the effects animation team to the work they did.<ref>[http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/02/01/Film/What-Disney.Is.All.About-2690972.shtml What Disney is all about]</ref> Due to the controversy it had caused, the scene was edited in the film's 2003 DVD and VHS releases, in which the dust no longer formed any words.<ref name="editedsex">{{cite video | people = | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 1)  | medium = DVD  | publisher = Walt Disney Home Video  | date=  2003}}</ref>

==="The Lion Sleeps Tonight"===
The use of the song "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa has led to disputes between Disney and the family of [[South Africa]]n [[Solomon Linda]], who composed the song (originally titled "Mbube") in 1939. In July 2004, the family filed suit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.<ref name="undisclosed">{{cite web | work=BBC news |title=Disney settles Lion song. dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4721564.stm | accessdaymonth=31 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Hamas' propaganda===
In [[August]] [[2007]], the [[Hamas]] organization produced an animated propaganda film that allegedly mimicked the style of ''The Lion King''. The program was aired via their [[television station]], ''Al-Aqsa TV''. Hamas was portrayed as a lion that chased and killed rats that bore the likenesses of members of the secular [[Fatah]] organization in [[Gaza]]. The program was briefly aired but was pulled off the air for revision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSB569000 |title=Hamas "Lion King" cartoon re-enacts Gaza takeover |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Nidal al-Mughrabi |date=September 4, 2007 |publisher=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/24/africa/ME-GEN-Palestinians-Hamas-Lion-King.php |title=Hamas battle cartoon mimics "Lion King" |accessdate=2007-12-24 |date=2007-08-24 |publisher=International Herald Tribune}}</ref>

==Impact on popular culture==
[[Image:2f32.jpg|left|thumb|Mufasa's cameo in the episode "[['Round Springfield]]" from ''[[The Simpsons]]''.]]
Because of its popularity, ''The Lion King'' has been referenced in various media. For instance, the animated TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' spoofed the film in the episode "[['Round Springfield]]". Towards the end of the episode, the ghost of Mufasa appears in the clouds with [[Bleeding Gums Murphy]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[James Earl Jones]] (who voiced both Mufasa and Darth Vader), saying: "You must avenge my death, Kimba... dah, I mean Simba," a reference to the ''Lion King''/''Kimba the White Lion'' controversy.<ref name="simpsons">{{cite web | work=TV.com | title=A clip from the Simpsons episode 'Round Springfield' which parodied The Lion King|url=http://www.tv.com/media_player/1019/4/viewer.php?context_type=101&context_id=146| accessdaymonth=23 August |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Disney also frequently referenced ''The Lion King'' in its own films. For example, in the Disney-released, [[Pixar]]-produced 1995 computer animated film ''[[Toy Story]]'', the song "[[Hakuna Matata]]" can be heard playing in [[List of Toy Story characters#Andy Davis|Andy's]] car during the film's climax.<ref name="toystory">{{cite web | work=Easter Eggs | title=''Toy Story'' easter eggs|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/46803.html| accessdaymonth=10 February |accessyear=2007}}</ref> This could also be referencing the fact that [[Tim Allen]], who voiced Buzz Lightyear, was in [[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]] with [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]], who voiced Cub Simba. Pumbaa made a cameo in ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996),<ref name="aladdin3">{{cite web | work=Disney Animation Kingdom - Jokes | title=''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'' in-jokes|url=http://disney.wretch.cc/Joke/aatkot.htm| accessdaymonth=27 August |accessyear=2006}}</ref> while ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' (1997) paid homage to both ''The Lion King'' and the [[Nemean Lion]]: Scar's skin is worn by Hercules while he is posing for a painting on a [[Greece|Greek]] vase.<ref name="hercules">{{cite web | work=Disney Animation Kingdom - Jokes | title=''Hercules'' in-jokes|url=http://disney.wretch.cc/Joke/c35.htm| accessdaymonth=27 August |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Video games==
Two video games based on the film have been released. The first, entitled, ''[[The Lion King (video game)|The Lion King]]'', was published in 1994 by [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and was released on [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Master System]], [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]], [[Game Gear]], [[Personal computer|PC]], and [[Amiga]]. The NES version, however, was only released in Europe, and was not identical to the SNES version. The second game, entitled ''[[The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure]]'', was published in 2000 by Activision and was released on [[PlayStation]] and [[Game Boy Color]].

In 1996, [[Disney Interactive]] and [[7th Level]] released ''[[Timon & Pumbaa's Jungle Games]]'' for the PC. It was later seen on the SNES. Games include one where Pumbaa uses his gas to destroy fruits and bugs (and even a kitchen sink) that fall out of trees, a variation on a pinball game, a game where you use a peashooter to hit enemy creatures in the jungle, a game where Timon has to jump onto hippos over a river to deliver bugs to Pumbaa, and a variation on ''[[Tetris]]'' called ''Bug Drop''.

A third game was published in 2004 simply called ''The Lion King'' for [[Game Boy Advance]] in Europe and Asia, but was in fact a game based on the direct-to-video prequel/midquel ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' with Timon and Pumbaa as the playable characters.

In the [[Disney]] and [[Square Enix]] video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', Simba appears as an ally that Sora can summon during battles.  He also appears again as a summon character in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]''.  In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', the Pride Lands becomes one of the playable worlds. Several characters from the film appear, including Simba, Timon, Pumbaa, Nala, Mufasa, Rafiki, Scar, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Zazu is absent from the game entirely, though this may be to prevent any confusion between zazu and a disguised [[Donald Duck]] (Donald is disguised as a zazu-like bird in the level)
