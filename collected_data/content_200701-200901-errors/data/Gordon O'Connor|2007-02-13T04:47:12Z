'''Gordon James O'Connor,''' [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]], [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|OMM]],  [[Canadian Forces Decoration|CD]], BA, B.Sc., [[Member of Parliament|MP]] (born [[May 18]], [[1939]]) is a retired [[Brigadier-General]], current [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Canadian House of Commons|Member of Parliament]] and the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]]. He is one of a few Defense Ministers to have served in the miltary, the last being [[Gilles Lamontagne]].

Born in [[Toronto, Ontario]], he has a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]] Mathematics and Physics from [[Concordia University]] and [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Philosophy from [[York University]].

He served over 30 years in the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian Army]], starting as a Second Lieutenant in the Armour Branch, retiring with the rank of Brigadier General. 

He then entered the private sector as Vice-President of Business Development for a large facility management firm, and Vice-President Operations for a vehicle testing centre. 

He was a Senior Associate with [[Hill & Knowlton]] Canada, a world-wide public relations, public affairs and strategic communications company.  O'Connor has also been an official [[lobbyist]] for several [[defense industry]] companies.  These companies include: [[BAE Systems]] (1996 to 2004), [[General Dynamics]] (1996 to 2001), [[Atlas Elektronik GmbH]] (1999 to 2004), and [[Airbus Military]] (2001 to 2004) <sup>[http://www.matthewgood.org/mblog/?p=891]</sup>.

He was elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 elections]] as a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] candidate in the [[Ottawa]] riding of [[Carleton—Mississippi Mills]] with slightly more than 50% of the vote. After winning he became Defence Critic for the Official Opposition. His vote share increased in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 election]]. He is an honorary member of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] student #S157.

Gordon is married and has two children, both of them are adults. He now lives in Kanata, where he has lived for over 20 years.

==Controversial Cabinet selection==

Though somewhat muted by the higher profile issues in the namings of [[David Emerson]] and [[Michael Fortier]] to the cabinet, the posting of O'Connor to the position of [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper|Harper]] was met with controversy.  Harkening back to ethics and accountability issues including a promised crackdown on lobbying and reforms to lobbying legislation [http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1139267414551&call_pageid=968332188774&col=968350116467] that Harper raised during the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], O'Connor's employment as a lobbyist for several major defence industry companies including some of the world's largest military contractors, such as [[General Dynamics]], [[BAE Systems]] and [[Airbus]] as recently as 2004 was seen by many as peculiar. Some feared that with the posting the minister would often be dealing with the very companies for whom he advised for and assisted in soliciting defence contracts; seemingly putting him in constant peril of conflict-of-interest issues[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/realitycheck/20060208.html]. However, the aim of the Accountability Act is to prevent people from moving from government to lobbying, and not the opposite as was the case with O'Connor

There were potential conflict-of-interest issues early in his term as one of the first major issues the Conservatives pledged they would sort out is the replacement of the Forces 'tactical airlift' fleet. One of the most prominient companies bidding for the contract to replace the present fleet of [[C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules Turboprops]] is [[Airbus S.A.S.]] for whom O'Connor worked as a lobbyist until February 2004, lobbying the former Liberal government to purchase the airplane that would become the [[Airbus A400M]] for its tactical airlift fleet[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060208.OCONNOR08/TPStory/National].

The Canadian Government eventually decided on the [[C-17 Globemaster III]], manufactured by [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]].

==Tenure as Minister==
O'Connor announced on May 30th 2006 that the [[Canadian Forces]] would be suspending usage of the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Mercedes G-Wagon]] combat vehicle to on-base operations only, after a number of Canadian soldiers were killed while travelling in the lightly-armoured vehicle. However, three months later it was revealed that no such order was ever given, and the controversial vehicles were still being used in combat operations.[http://thechronicleherald.ca/Canada/521909.html]

==Controversial Comments on Afghanistan==
On January 20, 2007 O'Connor was quoted as saying "When the [[Taliban]] or [[al-Qaeda]] came out of [[Afghanistan]], they attacked the twin towers and in those twin towers, 25 Canadians were killed.  The previous government and this government will not allow Canadians to be killed without retribution."
