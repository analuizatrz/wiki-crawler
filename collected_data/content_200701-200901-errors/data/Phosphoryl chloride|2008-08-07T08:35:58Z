'''Phosphoryl chloride''' (commonly called '''phosphorus oxychloride''') is a colourless liquid with the formula {{Phosphorus}}{{Oxygen}}{{Chlorine}}<sub>3</sub>. It hydrolyses in moist air to [[phosphoric acid]] to release choking fumes of [[hydrogen chloride]]. It is manufactured industrially on a large scale from [[phosphorus trichloride]] and [[oxygen]] or [[phosphorus pentoxide]]. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as [[tricresyl phosphate]].

==Structure  ==
Like phosphate, phosphoryl chloride is tetrahedral in shape. It features three P-Cl bonds and one very strong P=O double bond, with an estimated [[bond dissociation energy]] of 533.5 kJ/mol. On the basis of bond length and electronegativity, the Schomaker-Stevenson rule suggests that the double bond form is very dominant (in contrast with POF<sub>3</sub>). The P=O bond does not resemble the [[Pi bond|π bond]] in a [[carbonyl]] group as in a ketone. The appropriate description of the P-O interaction is a matter of long discussion. Older textbooks favor a description that invokes participation of the [[d-orbital|''d''-orbital]]s on phosphorus. Some of these d-orbitals project toward the O atom, overlapping with  [[p-orbital|''p''-orbital]]s on oxygen. More modern texts seem to favor a description where the P-O  [[Pi bond|π bond]]ing involves the sigma* components of the P-Cl bonds. These descriptions do not consider a role for d-orbitals.

==Chemical properties==
POCl<sub>3</sub> reacts with water and [[alcohol]]s to give [[phosphoric acid]] or [[phosphate ester]]s, respectively, for example

:O=PCl<sub>3</sub>  +  3 H<sub>2</sub>O  →  [[Phosphoric acid|O=P(OH)<sub>3</sub>]]  +  3 [[Hydrogen chloride|HCl]]

If the water is replaced by an [[alcohol]], the trialkyl phosphate esters result. Such reactions are often performed in the presence of an HCl acceptor such as [[pyridine]] or an [[amine]]. If POCl<sub>3</sub> is heated with an excess of a [[phenols|phenol]] ([[Aryl|Ar]]OH) in the presence of a [[Lewis acid]] catalyst such as [[magnesium chloride]] a triaryl phosphate ester is formed, for example:
:3 [[Phenol|C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH]]  +  O=PCl<sub>3</sub>  →  [[Triphenyl phosphate|O=P(OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]]  +  3 [[Hydrogen chloride|HCl]]

POCl<sub>3</sub> can also act as a [[Lewis base]], forming [[:Wiktionary:adduct|adduct]]s with a variety of Lewis acids such as [[titanium tetrachloride]]:
:Cl<sub>3</sub>P<sup>+</sup>-O<sup>&minus;</sup>  +  TiCl<sub>4</sub>  →  Cl<sub>3</sub>P<sup>+</sup>-O-<sup>&minus;</sup>TiCl<sub>4</sub>

The [[aluminium chloride]] adduct (POCl<sub>3</sub>·AlCl<sub>3</sub>) is quite stable, and so POCl<sub>3</sub> can be used to remove AlCl<sub>3</sub> completely from reaction mixtures at the end of a [[Friedel-Crafts reaction]]. POCl<sub>3</sub> reacts with [[hydrogen bromide]] in the presence of AlCl<sub>3</sub> to produce POBr<sub>3</sub>.

==Preparation==
Phosphoryl chloride can be prepared by the reaction of [[phosphorus trichloride]] with [[oxygen]] at 20-50 °C (air is ineffective):

2 [[phosphorus trichloride|PCl<sub>3</sub>]]  +  [[Oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]]  →  2 O=PCl<sub>3</sub>

An alternative synthesis involves the reaction of [[phosphorus pentachloride]] and [[phosphorus pentoxide]]. Since these compounds are both solids, a convenient way of performing the reaction is to [[Chlorination|chlorinate]] a mixture of PCl<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, which generates the PCl<sub>5</sub> [[:Wiktionary:in situ|''in situ'']]. As the PCl<sub>3</sub> is consumed, the POCl<sub>3</sub> becomes the reaction solvent.

6 [[phosphorus trichloride|PCl<sub>3</sub>]]  +  6 [[Chlorine|Cl<sub>2</sub>]]  → 6 [[Phosphorus pentachloride|PCl<sub>5</sub>]]

6 [[Phosphorus pentachloride|PCl<sub>5</sub>]]  +  [[Phosphorus pentoxide|P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>]]  →  10 POCl<sub>3</sub>

Phosphorus pentachloride also forms POCl<sub>3</sub> by reaction with water, but this reaction is less easily controlled than the above reaction.

==Uses==
The most important use for phosphoryl chloride is in the manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described [[#Chemical properties|above]]) such as [[triphenyl phosphate]] and [[tricresyl phosphate]]. These esters have been used for many years as [[flame retardant]]s and [[plasticiser]]s for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. Meanwhile trialkyl esters such as [[tributyl phosphate]] (made similarly from [[butan-1-ol]]) are used as [[liquid-liquid extraction]] solvents in [[nuclear reprocessing]] and elsewhere.

In the semiconductor industry, POCl<sub>3</sub> is used as a safe liquid phosphorus source in diffusion processes. The phosphorus acts as a dopant used to create N-type layers on a silicon wafer.

In the laboratory, POCl<sub>3</sub> is widely used as a dehydrating agent, for example the conversion of [[amide]]s to [[nitrile]]s. Similarly, certain cyclic amides can be cyclised to dihydro[[isoquinoline]] derivatives using the [[Bischler-Napieralski reaction]].

Such reactions are believed to go via an [[imidoyl chloride]]; in certain cases where it is stable, the imidoyl chloride is the final product. For example [[pyridone]]s and pyrimidones can be converted to chloro- derivatives of [[pyridine]]s and [[pyrimidine]]s, which are important intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry. Likewise [[barbituric acid]] is converted to 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine.<sup>[8]</sup> by reaction with POCl<sub>3</sub> at 140 °C.

Related to this chemistry is the use of POCl<sub>3</sub> in acylation of activated [[aromatic ring]]s via the [[Vilsmeier-Haack reaction]] to produce [[aryl]] [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s. The reaction most often uses a formamide such as [[dimethylformamide|DMF]] or ''N''-phenyl-''N''-methylformamide, and it produces an iminium salt which is easily hydrolysed to the aldehyde upon workup. For example [[anthracene]] gives 9-anthraldehyde:
