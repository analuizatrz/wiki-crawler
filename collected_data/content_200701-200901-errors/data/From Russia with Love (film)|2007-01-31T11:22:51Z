'''''From Russia with Love''''' is the second [[James Bond]] film in the official [[EON Productions]] series, and the second to star [[Sean Connery]] as the suave and sophisticated British Secret Service agent James Bond. The film was released in [[1963 in film|1963]], produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and directed by [[Terence Young]]. It is based on the [[From Russia with Love|eponymous 1957 novel]] by [[Ian Fleming]].

It is considered the best of the James Bond film series by many fans and critics, and by actor Sean Connery (who restated his view in a 2002 interview with [[Sam Donaldson]] for [[ABC News]]). Though the film's low-key tone contrasts with the popular outlandishness of ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', ''From Russia with Love'' is often considered the ideal Bond film that each film strives to aim for. [[Michael G. Wilson]], the current co-producer of the series with his half sister [[Barbara Broccoli]], has stated "We always start out trying to make another ''From Russia with Love'' and end up with another ''Thunderball''." In 2004, ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine named it the ninth-greatest British film of all time.

In 2005 it was adapted into a [[video game]], ''[[James Bond 007: From Russia with Love]]''. The game was made by [[Electronic Arts]] and featured all new voice work by Sean Connery as well as his likeness and the likeness of a number of the supporting cast from the film.

==Background==
As [[President Kennedy]] had named ''[[From Russia with Love]]'' among his ten favourite books of all time, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to the cinematic debut of [[James Bond]], ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel was a [[Cold War]] thriller, however the producers made the villains [[SPECTRE]] instead of the [[Soviet]] undercover agency [[SMERSH]]. The film introduced the now standard pre-credits sequence and the use of a popular singer to sing the theme.

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
The film follows the plot of Fleming's novel almost to the letter; however, the villain is the major change between the literary and cinematic versions of the story. At the [[Cold War]]'s height, EON Productions felt it inadvisable casting the Russians as villains, so [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] was replaced by [[SPECTRE]], the criminal organization who is a mutual enemy of both superpowers, introduced in the first James Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. As such, this film is a sequel to the previous film in that SPECTRE seeks revenge upon James Bond for his killing of [[Dr. Julius No]].

The film features the first appearance of [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], leader of SPECTRE, although he wouldn't directly confront Bond for several more cinematic adventures. To integrate SPECTRE to the storyline, minor changes were made so that the now SPECTRE agent Red Grant is responsible for actions committed by other characters in the novel. Other than these topical changes, the film's plot is the same as the novel's—James Bond is lured to [[Turkey]], where Corporal Tatiana (Tanya) Romanova is stationed to assist her defection, and obtains a LEKTOR decoder (renamed from the novel's Spektor to not confuse the audience with SPECTRE).

==Cast & characters==
*[[James Bond]] &mdash; [[Sean Connery]]
*[[M (James Bond)|M]] &mdash; [[Bernard Lee]]
*[[Miss Moneypenny]] &mdash; [[Lois Maxwell]]
*[[Q (James Bond)|Q]] &mdash; [[Desmond Llewelyn]]

*Kronsteen &mdash; [[Vladek Sheybal]]
*Vida &mdash; [[Aliza Gur]]
*Zora &mdash; [[Martine Beswick]]
*Kerim's Girl &mdash; [[Nadja Regin]]

The film notes the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Major Boothroyd, known as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], the character he would play in nearly all of the series' films, until his death in [[1999]]. The Q character appeared in the previous film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', but was portrayed by actor Peter Burton, and was addressed by M initially as Armourer (though 007's boss volunteers a "thank you, Major Boothroyd" after he demonstrates the Walther to Bond). The cast also features Robert Shaw, perhaps best known as Quint in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' ([[1975]]), as the villain Red Grant.

''From Russia with Love'' is the first series film with [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] as the primary soundtrack composer. The theme song, "From Russia with Love", was composed by [[Lionel Bart]] of ''[[Oliver!]]'' fame and sung by [[Matt Monro]], although the title credit music is a lively instrumental version of the tune (segueing into the "James Bond Theme"). Monro's vocal version is later played during the film (as source music on a radio) and properly over the film's end titles. 

John Barry, arranger of [[Monty Norman]]'s "[[James Bond Theme]]" for ''Dr. No'', would be the dominant Bond series composer for most of its history and the inspiration for the current lead Bond movie composer, [[David Arnold]] (who uses cues from this soundtrack in his own for ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''). In this film, Barry introduced the percussive theme "[[James Bond music#007|007]]" – action music that came to be considered the 'secondary James Bond Theme' and is used in various of the Bond films of Sean Connery, and also [[Roger Moore]]'s ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''. The arrangement appears twice on this soundtrack album; the second version, entitled "007 Takes the Lektor", is the one used during the gunfight at the gypsy camp and also during Bond's theft of the Lektor decoding machine.) 

The completed film features a holdover from the Monty Norman-supervised ''Dr. No'' music – the post-rocket-launch music from ''No'' (after Bond disrupts No's attempts to jam the takeoff) appears in ''Russia'' at the conclusion of the helicopter attack,  and also at the attempt of SPECTRE to intercept Bond's speedboat. This cue, incidentally lifted by Arnold for ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', is naturally absent from the ''Russia'' soundtrack album.

As Barry himself notes, 1964's ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' would be the first Bond film in which he had total creative control over the soundtrack, including the music of the theme song. ([[Leslie Bricusse]] and [[Anthony Newley]] would contribute the theme's lyrics).

==Vehicles & gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}
*Attache case &mdash; Technically, James Bond's first gadget. The briefcase issued to 007 by Q-Branch contains a folding [[AR-7]] [[sniper rifle]] with twenty rounds of ammunition, a pop-out flat throwing knife and fifty [[gold sovereign]]s for bribery/a hard currency reserve in secret compartments accessible from inside the case. In addition, the case has a trick safety mechanism that detonates a magnetically attached [[tear gas]] bomb if it is improperly opened. This standard-issue item is also carried by Nash in the film (and so appropriated by Grant), and is obliquely mentioned in ''[[Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[Licence to Kill]]''.
*[[Pager]] &mdash; Although ''From Russia with Love'' was filmed in the [[1960s]], before this gadget's invention, Bond carried one, enabling MI6 to contact him at once; also, Bond's Bentley automobile had a radio-telephone, a device some newspaper reporters had obtained in the 1950s. (Joe Martin of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' was pictured using one in an archive photo published in one of the paper's 1990s anniversary retrospectives.)
*Bug detector &mdash; A small device that is designed to detect the presence of a [[Telephone tapping|phone tap]] device in a normal telephone when placed against such a device. (Subsequent Bond films to feature similar items include ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' and ''[[A View to a Kill]]''.)
*Tape recorder disguised as a camera.
*The LEKTOR decoder, though never actually seen in use, could also count as a gadget (Fleming based it – SPEKTOR in his novel, but changed for obvious reasons – directly on the [[Enigma machine]], a [[cryptology]] device used by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]s during [[World War II]]).
*The helicopter used at the end to chase Bond is a [[Hiller H-23]], which first flew in 1948.
*Bond drives a Fairey Huntress 23ft powerboat towards the end of the film, and the other boats in the chase were Fairey Huntsmans and all were supplied by Fairey Marine.

==Trivia==
*[[Alfred Hitchcock]] was originally considered as director for the film version in 1958, with Bond to be played by [[Cary Grant]] and a possible return to the screen for [[Grace Kelly]] as Tatiana Romanova, but the deals fell through when ''[[Vertigo (movie)|Vertigo]]'' performed badly at the box office. The helicopter scene in ''From Russia with Love'' mimics the cropduster scene from the film Hitchcock did instead in ''[[North by Northwest]]''.
*In recent years, the scene in which Bond first encounters Tatiana in his hotel room often has been used to screen-test actors for the James Bond and leading lady roles.
*Bond's ''Russia'' scenes with M and Q are played with none of the tenseness of their meetings in later 007 films, where the intelligence chief and equipment officer would show notable frustration with his flippancy. In fact, M is charmed by the idea of Bond using his fondness for women as a tool, specifically to get the LEKTOR decoder.
*Reportedly, author and James Bond creator Ian Fleming makes a cameo in the Istanbul train scene (following Bond's stealing the LEKTOR decoder), standing outside on the right of the train, wearing grey trousers and a white sweater; some sources deny Fleming's appearance.
*[[Pedro Armendáriz]], who played Kerim Bey had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and reportedly did this role to provide financially for his family before his impending death. Armendáriz's scenes were given top priority and he limps visibly in most of them. On the evening of June 18, 1963, while at the [[UCLA]] medical center, a gun was smuggled into his hospital room and the 51-year-old Armendáriz took his own life.  Twenty-five years later, his son, [[Pedro Armendáriz Jr.]], also an actor, was hired for a small role in the [[1989]] James Bond film ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' as the President of the fictional Republic of Isthmus.
*Lotte Lenya's character, Colonel Rosa Klebb, often is cited as prototype of the Frau Farbissina character in the [[Austin Powers]] spy spoof series. Klebb would be the first of several Bond villains with ambiguous sexuality. Although in the novel this was made more explicit, Klebb's lesbian tendencies in the film are more hinted at by having her place her hand on Romanova's knee and moments later stroking her hair during a scene with her briefing Tatiana.  Lotte Lenya was the widow of [[Kurt Weill]]. In the film "Undercover Blues" starring Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner, in the mock-torture scene, Dennis Quaid refers to Kathleen Turner (who was pretending to be a Russian doctor specializing in pain) as "Dr Lottelenya"(of the "Rosa Klebb Institute"), a clear tribute to Lotte Lenya's portrayal of Rosa Klebb.
*The Bulgarian assassin Krilencu tries to escape from his apartment through a secret window in a billboard advertising ''[[Call Me Bwana]]'' with the face of [[Anita Ekberg]], the only non-James Bond film produced by [[EON Productions]].  Ironically, [[Rik Van Nutter]] who would play Felix Leiter in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' was married to Ekberg.
*The "007" theme (the song played during the gunfight at the gypsy camp and also during Bond's theft of the LEKTOR) was used as part of the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format on [[Philadelphia]] television station [[KYW-TV]]. 
*Although not credited, the actor who 'played' [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], a.k.a. Number One of [[SPECTRE]] was [[Anthony Dawson]], the same actor who had played Professor Dent in the previous Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', also directed by [[Terence Young]]. The actual actor of Blofeld was credited with a [[question mark]].
*A version of the haunting "Stalking" track -- from the pre-credit sequence of ''From Russia with Love'' involving Connery and Shaw -- appears in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', when Bond ([[Roger Moore]]) and Anya Amasova (Agent XXX, played by [[Barbara Bach]]) confront [[Richard Kiel]]'s Jaws character at a historic site in Egypt. Ironically, ''Spy'' was scored not by Barry but [[Marvin Hamlisch]], one of only four times Barry did not helm the Bond music arrangements in the first 16 [[United Artists]] installments.
* Assistant director [[Kit Lambert]], later became a record producer and manager for the rock band [[The Who]].
*During one take of the helicopter scene, the helicopter flew too close to Connery and he would have been injured or killed had he not dived out of the way.
*In the opening credit sequence [[Martine Beswick]], who played the gypsy girl Zora, is credited as Martin Beswick.
*The periscope used to spy on the Russian Embassy was a wooden dummy built by UK manufacturer Barr & Stroud.
*Italian actress [[Daniela Bianchi]] (Tatiana Romanova) possessed limited English language skills, thus her voice was dubbed by [[Barbara Jefford]]
*''From Russia With Love'' is the first Bond film to end with the ubiquitous post-credits tagline "James Bond will be back in..."
