'''Ted McMeekin''' (born about 1948)<ref>News, ''A personal look at the canadidates'', (Hamilton: The Hamilton Spectator), Aug 5, 2000, sec A.03.</ref> is a politician residing in [[Flamborough]] [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  He is a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]], representing the riding of [[Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale (provincial electoral district)|Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Westdale]] for the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal Party of Ontario]].  On Tuesday October 30, 2007, the Premier of Ontario announced McMeekin's appointment to the cabinet as the [[Ministry of Government and Consumer Services (Ontario)|Minister of Government and Consumer Services]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=d248b055-8c43-4ae4-b646-4ec020b89e93|title=McGuinty names new cabinet|accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

McMeekin holds a [[Master's Degree]] in social work from [[Wilfrid Laurier University]].  He has served as executive director of the Burlington Social Planning Council, and was for a time the chair of part-time studies at [[Mohawk College]] (where he also taught courses).  He has also worked on social justice issues for the [[United Church of Canada]], and was the owner and operator a small bookstore for eight years.

Before entering provincial politics, McMeekin was a member of the [[Hamilton City Council]] representing Ward 7 (Hamilton Mountain). After retiring from Council, he moved to [[Flamborough, Ontario]], a rural community which lies on the outskirts of [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and later served a term of six years as [[mayor]].<ref>Richard Brennan, ''Hostile voters target Tory in Hamilton by-election'', (Toronto: The Toronto Star), September 04, 2000</ref> McMeekin was also for a number of years Flamborough's representative on the Hamilton-Wentworth regional council, which the provincial government of [[Mike Harris]] eliminated in [[2000]] by amalgamating the city and outlying regions into a single political entity (akin to the "mega-city" of Toronto).  McMeekin was one of the most vocal opponents of this change, noting that it would result in a loss of autonomy for Flamborough.

== 2000 by-election ==
McMeekin's plans to jump from municipal to provincial politics had been rumoured for years, and it came as no surprise when he won the Liberal nomination for a [[by-election]] to be held in ADFA on [[September 7]], 2000 (called following the resignation of [[Member of Provincial Parliament]] (MPP) [[Toni Skarica]], another vocal opponent of the amalgamation scheme).  Although the seat had gone overwhelmingly for the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservatives]] the previous year, McMeekin managed to defeat PC candidate [[Priscilla de Villiers]] by over 9000 votes.  The Conservatives had spent $211,989 on his competitor, nearly $80,000 in excess of McMeekin's $132,143.<ref>News, ''Big budget didn't bring election win'', (Hamilton: The Hamilton Spectator), April 17, 2001</ref>  Local opposition to amalgamation was generally cited as the reason for this shift.

== 2003 Provincial Election ==
In the [[Ontario general election, 2003|provincial election of 2003]], McMeekin defeated Tory candidate [[Mark Mullins (politician)|Mark Mullins]] by a somewhat reduced margin.  He served as [[parliamentary assistant]] to [[John Gerretsen]] in his capacity as the Minister responsible for [[Seniors (Ontario ministry)|Seniors]] from [[October 23]], [[2003]] to [[September 27]], [[2004]].  On [[September 27]], 2004, he was appointed assistant to [[Jim Watson]], the [[Ministry of Consumer and Business Services (Ontario)|Ministry of Consumer and Business Services]].

== 2007 Provincial Election ==

In the [[ontario general election, 2007|provincial election of 2007]], McMeekin is running against Progressive Conservative candidate Chris Corrigan.  On October 30, 2007, McMeekin was named a cabinet minister, responsible for Government and Consumer Services.
