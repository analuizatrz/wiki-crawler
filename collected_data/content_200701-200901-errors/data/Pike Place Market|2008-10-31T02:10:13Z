'''Pike Place Market''' is a [[public market]] overlooking the [[Elliott Bay]] waterfront in [[Seattle]], [[Washington]], [[United States]]. The Market, which opened August 17, 1907, is one of the oldest continually operated public farmers' markets in the United States. It is a place of business for many small [[farmer]]s, [[craft]]speople and [[merchant]]s. It is also one of Seattle's most popular [[tourist]] destinations. Located in [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|Downtown]], it occupies over {{convert|9|acre|ha|lk=on}}. It is named after its central street, Pike Place, which runs northwest from Pike Street to Virginia Street.

The Market is built on the edge of a steep hill. It has several lower levels below the main level, featuring a variety of unique [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shops]]. [[Antiques|Antique]] dealers, [[comic book]] sellers, and small family-owned [[restaurant]]s are joined by one of the few remaining [[head shop]]s in Seattle. The upper street level features [[fishmonger]]s, fresh [[produce]] stands, and craft stalls operating in the covered [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s. Local farmers and craftspeople sell year-round in the arcades from tables they [[Renting|rent]] from the Market on a daily basis, in accordance with the Market's mission and founding goal: allowing consumers to "Meet the Producer." The Market is also home to nearly 500 low income residents who live in 8 different buildings throughout the Market. The Market is run by the [[Public development authority|quasi-government]] Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA).

The heavy line on the map labeled "Alaskan W[a]y Viad[uct]" is part of [[Washington State Route 99]] (SR-99). The unlabeled street inland from SR-99 as it passes the market is Western Avenue.]]
The Market is located roughly in the northwest corner of Seattle's [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|central business district]]. To its north is [[Belltown, Seattle, Washington|Belltown]]. To its southwest are the [[Central Waterfront, Seattle, Washington|central waterfront]] and [[Elliott Bay]]. Boundaries are diagonal to the compass since the street grid is roughly parallel to the Elliott Bay shoreline.<ref name="Seattle Clerk Office Map">{{cite web

As is common with Seattle neighborhoods and districts,<ref name="About Seattle Clerk Office Map" /> different people and organizations draw different boundaries for the Market. The City Clerk's Neighborhood Map Atlas gives one of the more expansive definitions, defining a "Pike-Market" neighborhood extending from Union Street northwest to Virginia Street and from the waterfront northeast to Second Avenue.<ref name="Seattle Clerk Office Map" /> Despite coming from the City Clerk's office, this definition has no special official status.<ref name="About Seattle Clerk Office Map" />

The smaller "Pike Place Public Market Historic District" listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] is bounded roughly by First Avenue, Virginia Street, Western Avenue, and a building wall about halfway between Union and Pike Streets, running parallel to those streets.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nr//travel/seattle/s11.htm Pike Place Public Market Historic District], Seattle: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary, National Parks Service. Accessed online 2 October 2008.</ref>

In a middle ground between those two definitions, the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods' official {{convert|7|acre|ha|adj=on}} "Pike Place Market Historical District"<ref name=hist-dist>[http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/preservation/pikeplace.htm Pike Place Market Historical District], Seattle Department of Neighborhoods. Accessed online 7 October 2008.</ref> includes the federally recognized Pike Place Public Market Historic District plus a slightly smaller piece of land between Western Avenue and [[Washington State Route 99]], on the side of the market toward Elliott Bay.<ref>[http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/preservation/pikeplace_map.htm Pike Place Market Historical District] map, Seattle Department of Neighborhoods. Accessed online 2 October 2008.</ref>

To some extent, these different definitions of the market district result from struggles between preservationists and developers. For example, the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]] created the Washington Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. [[Victor Steinbrueck]] at one point in the late 1960s convinced the Advisory Council to recommend designating {{convert|17|acre|ha}} as a historical district. Pressure by developers and the "Seattle establishment" soon got that reduced to a tenth of that acreage.<ref name=Crowley-1999>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1999}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Speidel|1967}}<!-- page number would be nice, this is a book.--></ref> The present-day historic district designations lie between these extremes.

Part of the market sits on what was originally [[mudflats]] below the bluffs west of Pike Place. In the late 19th century,  West Street (now Western Avenue, angling away from Pike Place) was already a through street running more or less parallel to the shore. Railroad Avenue (now Alaskan Way) was built farther out on pilings; it was not filled in until the 1930s. Nearby piers with warehouses for convenient [[stevedore|stevedoring]] had already been completed by 1905, two years before the Market opened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Phelps|1978|p=71-73}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Thomas Street History Services|2006|p=11, 41}}.</ref>

==History==
===Before the Market===

Before the creation of the Pike Place Market in 1907, local Seattle area farmers sold their goods to the public in a three-square block area area called The Lots, located at Sixth Avenue and King Street. Most produce sold at The Lots would then be brought to commercial wholesale houses on Western Avenue, which became known as Produce Row. Most farmers, due to the amount of time required to work their farms, were forced to sell their produce on consignment through the wholesalers on Western Avenue. The farmers typically received a percentage of the final sale price for their goods. They would sell to the middleman on commission, as most farmers would often have no time to sell direct to the public, and their earnings would be on marked up prices and expected sales. In some cases, the farmers made a profit, but just as often found themselves breaking even, or getting no money at all due to the business practices of the wholesalers. During the existence of the wholesale houses, which far predated the Market, there were regular rumors as well as instances of corruption in denying payment to farmers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=15-16}}</ref>

Consumers were also unhappy with the system. Manipulated prices often forced them to pay unexpectedly high prices for staple foods. For example, in 1906 and 1907, the price of food skyrocketed mysteriously. Onion prices climbed from 10 cents a pound in 1906 to a dollar a pound in 1907 (from [[United States dollar|US$]]0.10 to $1.00).<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=17}}</ref> By comparison, a pair of shoes cost $2.00 at the time.<ref name=official-web-history/>

===Founding===
As consumers and farmers grew increasingly vocal in their unhappiness over the situation, [[Thomas P. Revelle]], a Seattle [[Seattle City Council|city councilman]], lawyer, and newspaper editor, took advantage of an 1896 Seattle city ordinance that allowed the city to designate tracts of land as public markets. The area of Western Avenue above the [[Elliott Bay]] tideflats and the area of the commission food houses had just been turned into a wooden planked road, called Pike Place, off of Pike Street and First Avenue. Through a city council ordinance vote, he had Pike Place designated temporarily as the city's first public market on August 5, 1907.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=18-19}}</ref>

On Saturday, [[August 17]], [[1907]] City Council President [[Charles Hiram Burnett Jr.]], filling in for the elected Mayor as Acting Mayor of Seattle, declared the day Public Market Day and cut the ribbon. <ref name=official-web-history>{{cite web | title=History of the Market | work=Pike Place Market | url=http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/site.asp?p=history | accessmonthday=December 15 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> In the week leading up to the opening of the Pike Place Market, various rumors and stories of further corruption were reported by the ''[[Seattle Times]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=20}}</ref> Roughly ten farmers pulled up their wagons on a [[boardwalk]] adjacent to the Leland Hotel.<ref name=Crowley-1999 /> The ''Times'' alleged several reasons for the low turnout of farmers: Western Avenue wholesale commission men who had gone to the nearby valleys and farms to buy all the produce out ahead of time to ruin the event; threats of violence by commission men against farmers; and farmers' fear of possible boycotts and lack of business with the commission men if the Market idea did not succeed in the long term.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=20}}</ref>

As the ribbon was cut to open the Market, fifty customers, the ten farmers with produce wagons, a policeman, and various city officials were present. Once the opening ceremony completed, the fifty customers were reported to have pushed past and over the policeman, and began to buy out the first wagon of vegetables before the farmer could even pull the wagon to the curb.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=13}}</ref> One porter, who worked for the Western Avenue wholesalers, apparently grew angry at the direct competition by the farmers, and climbed into one of the produce wagons. He began to freely give away the farmer's goods, before the angry spectators pulled him down. Other farmers complained of their goods being smashed in the street by young men and boys, who were accused of trying to start a riot.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=14}}</ref> In ''Soul of the City'', one farmer was quoted speaking to a reporter describing that first day:

<blockquote>"The next time I come to this place, I'm going to get police protection or put my wagon on stilts. I got rid of everything, all right, but I didn't really sell a turnip. You see, those society women stormed my wagon, crawled over the wheels and crowded me off to respectable distance, say 20 feet. When I got back the wagon was swept as clean as a good housewife's parlor, and there in a bushel basket was a quart of silver."<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=14}}</ref></blockquote>

Hundreds of more customers soon arrived, and before noon that day, all the farmers' produce had sold out.<ref name=Crowley-1999 />

===First expansion years===

In 1907 [[Frank Goodwin]] owned Goodwin Real Estate Company in Seattle, together with his brothers Frank and John. Headquarterd in the city's [[Alaska Building]], they owned the Leland Hotel on Pike Street and the undeveloped tracts of land that surrounded Pike Place along the Western Avenue bluff.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=23}}</ref> On the opening day of the Market, Goodwin observed the early morning chaos of farmers dealing with large crowds. Sensing that their land was about to appreciate in value, they began to heavily advertise adjoining plots for sale. Goodwin immediately began to sketch plans for enclosures to house farmers along the company property he owned on Pike Place, and began to develop business plans to lease stalls in those enclosure them to farmers. Funded by Goodwin Real Estate, work began immediately on what is today the Main Arcade of the Pike Place Market, northwest of and adjoining the Leland Hotel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=25}}</ref>

[[Image:Pike Public Market - vegetable vendor daystalls - 1917 .jpg|thumb|left|Vegetable vendors selling from Main Arcade daystalls, 1917. Part of the Sanitary Market and Corner Market are visible across Pike Place.]]
The first building at the Market, the Main Arcade, opened November 30, 1907.<ref name=Crowley-1999 /> At its opening, a forty-piece band performed for a large cheering crowd.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=25}}</ref> During the early years of the Pike Place Market, Seattle city ordinances limited its hours of operation to only 5 am to 12 noon, Monday through Saturday, and placed initial supervision of the facility with the city Department of Streets and Sewers. Local police gave out vendor stalls to farmers on a first come, first served basis.<ref name=Shorett-Morgan-28>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=28}}</ref> In 1910, two farmers' associations organized themselves: the Washington Farmers Association represented Japanese farmers; other farmers organized as the White Home Growers Association.<ref>[http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/Exhibits/PPM/panel6.htm Farmers and the Market], part of a Seattle Municipal Archives series for the Market centennial in 2007. Accessed online 13 October 2008.</ref> By 1911, demand for the Market had grown so much that the number of available stalls had doubled, and extended north from Pike Street to Stewart Street, doubling in size since the opening of the Main Arcade. The west side of the stall lines were soon covered in an overhead canopy and roofing, becoming known as the "dry row". The daily rent for any stall in 1911 was $0.20 a day.<ref name=Shorett-Morgan-28 />

Also in 1911, the City of Seattle created the first full-time jobs to support Market farmers and customers. The Market Inspector, his assistant, and a janitor were the first ever employees of the Pike Place Market. The Inspector, which was renamed Market Master shortly afterward, assigned stalls to farmers and collected their daily fees.<ref name=Jones-12>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=12 (p. 24 of the PDF)}}</ref> The first Market Master, John Winship, initiated a lottery scheme to replace the previous first-come system. To buy a lottery ticket for a stall, farmers had to pay the next day's fee ahead of time. The Pike Place Market had many Japanese farmers, and Winship at first had them choose from a roll of tickets that made it more likely they would receive vendor stalls furthest from the heaviest customer foot traffic. Once the Japanese and other farmers complained about the practice, he quickly stopped it to ensure a fair lottery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=28-30}}</ref> In 1912, the Corner Market building was completed, across the street from the Bartell Building, which would later become the Economy Market.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=36}}</ref>

The Market Master and his assistant were also responsible to ensure that farmers used no questionable practices on their customers. Some farmers had weighed down bags of produce for the scales with rocks and gravel, had tried to sneak unripe or spoiled fruit into purchases and, according to one customer, a butcher let his hands "lovingly linger" whenever he weighed meat on his scales. Vendors caught cheating customers would be denied stall rentals for a period of time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=28-30}}</ref>

The Public Market & Department Store Company was founded in 1911 by the Goodwins to manage their Pike Place Market properties. They began to design a series of expansions to the Market properties they owned, including the North Arcade, which they planned to build down the bluff along Pike Place. They planned to have all their building expansions set at all times a minimum of ten feet from the sidewalk, to allow extra space for vendors. At the time Frank Goodwin's designs, plans, and intended visual appearance of the Market were considered idiosyncratic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=32}}</ref>

At the same time as the Goodwins were planning to dramatically expand the Market, the farmers began increasingly to complain about it. They wanted the per-day stall rental fee cut from $0.20 to $0.10, which they were granted.  They complained about having to haul produce up the bluff from Western Avenue, and unsuccessfully demanded a mechanical conveyor. Complaints about overcrowding were constant. The farmers also wanted a wooden planked floor set up directly below the Main Arcade for storage.  Quickly having grown unhappy with a lack of progress on the part of the city, the farmers used Washington State's then new [[Ballot initiative#Initiative in the United States|ballot initiative system]] to obtain a $150,000 municipal bond issue for their desired improvements.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=30}}</ref>

Seattle Mayor [[George Cotterill (Seattle)|George Cotterill]], an engineer, was not in favor of some of the farmer's plans and the idea of such a large municipal bond. Cotterill appointed a committee to study the various requests and complaints of the farmers, and the committee came to the conclusion that the planned floor expansion and conveyor system the farmers wanted would be unsanitary, difficult to maintain, and far more expensive than they had projected. In response, Cotterill drafted an alternate ballot initiative, for a $25,000 municipal bond. Cotterill's initiative would result in Pike Place becoming a paved road rather than the wood road it currently was, would expand the sidewalks along the arcades by 15 feet, and would improve all the Market roadsides for wagon stalls and tables, placing them all under roofing. On March 13, 1913, Seattle voters rejected the farmer initiative, and passed the mayor's initiative. The first major expansion work on the Market began immediately.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=30}}</ref>

[[Image:Pike Place Market from Western Avenue in Seattle.jpg|thumb|Pike Place Market in 2008, as seen from above Western Avenue. The top floor, above the painted text, is street level with Pike Place. The historic "Main Arcade" is on that level, and below this building a large bluff extends down to Western Avenue, which is the visible street level.]]
In 1914, spurred by the public initiative of the preceding year, the Goodwins implemented the expansion plans they had been preparing for the Market properties they owned. The Main Arcade was expanded downward, along Pike Place's sheer bluff to Western Avenue below, creating five additional lower floors in a massive, "labyrinthine" structure. By the time the expansions were completed, Pike Place Market extended 240 feet to the west, past the edge of the bluff. New space was created for several restaurants, bakeries, a creamery, butchers, additional stalls and rows in the lower sections for farmers to sell their goods, grain markets, public toilets, two floors dedicated to storage of meats and produce, 100 retail stores, a theater, and a printing plant. The entire expansion was done modestly, aside from its scale. The basic design elements were steel and wood beams, simple railings of rounded metal, basic wooden banisters, and simple wood and tile floors. Frank Goodwin had wanted always to emphasize the Market's products, rather than its design. There was, at the time. little ornamentation, except for ornate columns at the Pike and Pike Place entrance, and occasional carved reliefs of seafood or produce on the various columns throughout the Market. Goodwin even went so far as to exclude a ceremonial cornerstone from the Market design.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=32-33}}</ref>

The last of the core buildings of the Market for the coming decades was obtained in 1916 by the Goodwins, when they purchased a long-term lease on the Bartell Building at the corner of 1st Avenue and Pike Street. Renamed to the Economy Market, it became an expansion to the Main Arcade, directly to its southeast. Frank Goodwin redesigned the internal layout of the Bartell Building to include space for an additional 65 vendor stalls, numerous spaces for retail stores, and a full ballroom. Unlike the original designs of the Main Arcade, Frank allowed for more artistic designs to be used on the Economy Market, with frescoes, electric signs, and even more designs used on the columns in the new expansion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=33}}</ref> 

In 1917, with America taking part in [[World War I]], more and more women began to work the various stalls and shops in the Market as their husbands went to war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=41}}</ref> By the time the war was underway, the Western Avenue commission houses that had led to the creation of the Pike Place Market were in decline, being unable to compete directly with the farmers. The net effect was a near complete stop by the time of World War I of the food price profiteering that had been rampant previously.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=41}}</ref> Washington State government took an interest later in insuring that such things would be prevented during the war for the benefit of its citizens. The Fisheries Commission turned over to the Seattle city government dead hatchery salmon that were killed for eggs and sperm to combat rising fish prices. The city created the municipal-owned City Fish Market at Pike Place Market, cutting the cost of salmon by a third. The city-owned fish vendor business would only last until the end of World War I, when it was stopped.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=42-43}}</ref> In 1918, wanting to spend more time on his other business ventures, Frank sold his stake in the Pike Place Market to his brother Arthur, who took control of most of the business.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=35}}</ref>

===Later history===
[[Image:Pike Place Market - sugar vendor - 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Sugar vendor, 1917.]]
Throughout the early 1920s, business continued to boom at the Pike Place Market. The north side of the Corner Market became the Sanitary Market, housing delicatessens, butchers, restaurants, and bakeries. Three Girls Bakery opened, which would draw large crowds to watch their new automated doughnut machines. The so-called "[[Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet|mosquito fleet]]", precursor to the modern [[Washington State Ferries|Washington State Ferry]] system, would bring shoppers from various islands in [[Puget Sound]] to shop, and Market vendors began to bring goods to the docks for the island residents to buy direct when they saw the ships approach. The ships would only arrive mid-morning, so islanders had no ability to get the best produce at the opening of the Market. Seeing an opportunity, the Hotel Dix, which was located at the time just north of the Market, would offer special overnight rates to island residents that allowed them to stay on the mainland with an early morning wake-up call to compete with local residents for the best goods. To compete for all of these customers, Market vendors began to arrange their goods in elaborate patterns. The Liberty Theater, on First Avenue, hired attendants to watch customer's Market purchases who paid the price of a nickel matinee while they shopped more. The area became a social scene, where young Seattle locals went to see and be seen. Children from an orphanage in [[Des Moines, Washington]] performed street concerts on Saturdays.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shorett|Morgan|2007|p=36-41}}</ref>

At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]] December 7, 1941, many of the farmers selling in Pike Place Market were [[Japanese-American]]s. The late Seattle historian [[Walt Crowley]] estimated that they might have been as many as four-fifths of the farmers selling produce from stalls.<ref name=Crowley-1999 /> President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed [[United States Executive Order 9066|Executive Order 9066]] February 19, 1942, which eventually forced all Americans of Japanese ancestry in an "exclusion zone" that included the entirety of the West Coast states and southern [[Arizona]] into internment camps.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/personal_justice_denied/chap2.htm Chapter 2: Executive Order 9066] in Tetsuden Kashima and the United States Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of civilians, ''[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/personal_justice_denied/index.htm Personal Justice Denied: Report of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians]'', University of Washington Press, ISBN 029597558X. Reproduced online on the site of the National Parks Service. Accessed online 14 October 2008.</ref> On March 11, [[Executive Order 9095]] created the Office of the Alien Property Custodian and gave it discretionary, plenary authority over all alien property interests.

In 1963, a proposal was floated to demolish Pike Place Market and replace it with ''Pike Plaza'', which would include a [[hotel]], an [[apartment building]], four [[office building]]s, a [[hockey]] arena, and a [[parking garage]]. This was supported by the [[mayor]], many on the [[city council]], and a number of market property owners. However, there was significant community opposition, including help from [[Betty Bowen]], [[Victor Steinbrueck]], and others from the board of Friends of the Market, and an [[initiative]] was passed on November 2, 1971 that created a [[historic preservation]] zone and returned the Market to public hands. The Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority was created by the city to run the Market. Over the course of the 1970s, all the Market's historic buildings were restored and renovated using the original plans and blueprints and appropriate materials.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

In the 1980s, federal welfare reform squeezed the social services based in the Market. As a result, a nonprofit group, the Pike Place Market Foundation, was established by the PDA to raise funds and administer the Market's free clinic, senior center, low-income housing, and childcare center. Also in the 1980s the wooden floors on the top arcade were replaced with tiles (so as to prevent water damage to merchandise on the lower floors) that were laid by the PDA after staging a hugely successful capital campaign - people could pay $35 to have their name(s) inscribed on a tile. Between 1985 and 1987, more than 45,000 tiles were installed and nearly 1.6 million dollars was raised.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

The 1983 Hildt Amendment or Hildt Agreement (named after [[Seattle City Council]] member Michael Hildt) struck a balance between farmers and craftspeople in the daystalls.<ref name=Worth>Mark Worth, [http://www.seattleweekly.com/1998-05-27/news/daystalled-again/ Daystalled again], ''Seattle Weekly'', May 27, 1998. Accessed 10 October 2008.</ref> The agreement set rules that would last for ten years from August 1, 1983, and that would be successively renewable for further terms of five years.<ref>[[Nick Licata]], [http://www.seattle.gov/council/licata/up/up48.htm Urban Politics #48], 19 October 1998. Accessed 15 October 2008</ref> The precise formula it laid out stood for over 15 years, and it set the precedent for today's allocation of daystalls, in that it gave craftspeople priority in the North Arcade and farmers priority elsewhere.<ref name=Worth />

[[Victor Steinbrueck Park]] directly north of the market was originally Market Park. From about 1909 the site held an armory, which was damaged by fire in 1962. The land was taken over by the city in 1968, and the remnant of the armory was razed. In 1970 the land passed to park usage. The resulting Market Park was majorly redesigned in 1982. After Steinbrueck's 1985 death, it was renamed after the architect who was instrumental in the market's preservation.<ref>[http://www.seattle.gov/PARKS/park_detail.asp?ID=338 Victor Steinbrueck Park], Seattle Parks and Recreation]. Accessed 15 October 2008.</ref>

===Modern day===
[[Image:Seattle Steinbrueck Park - B.jpg|thumb|300 px|Victor Steinbrueck Park, September 2006]]
In 1998, the PDA decided to end the Hildt Agreement. While their proposed new rule to allocate daystalls was generally seen as more favorable to farmers, there were both farmers and craftspeople who objected, especially because the PDA's timing gave them little chance to study the changes. At their last meeting before the August 1 deadline, the PDA voted 8-4, to notify the City of its intent not to renew the Agreement. The City Council did not accept the proposed substitute. The Council and PDA extended the Hildt agreement 9 months and the council agreed to an extensive public review process in which the Market Constituency played a major role.<ref name=Jones-iv>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=''iv''}} (p. 8 of PDF).</ref> 

The public meetings did not result in a clear consensus, but did provide enough input for city councilmember [[Nick Licata]] to draft a revised version of the Hildt Agreement.<ref name=Jones-iv /> Adopted in February 1999, it became known as the Licata-Hildt Agreement. The bad blood generated by the conflict spurred an audit of PDA practices by the City Auditor; the audit was critical of the PDA for occasionally violating the "spirit" of its Charter, but exonerated it of any wrongdoing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999}}, ''passim'', especially ''iv'', 19 (p. 8, 31 of PDF).</ref>

==How the Market functions==
===Organizations===
The Pike Place Market is overseen by the Pike Place Market Preservation & Development Authority ("the PDA"), a [[public development authority]] (a form of [[government-owned corporation]] established under Washington State law. It is overseen by a 12-member volunteer council. Its members serve four-year terms. Four members are appointed by mayor, four by the current council, and four by the Pike Place Market Constituency. The Market PDA sets the policies by which the Pike Place Market is managed and hires an executive director to carry out those policies.<ref>[http://www.seattle.gov/html/citizen/pda.htm Public Development Authorities], City of Seattle. Accessed online 6 October 2008.</ref><ref name="Market organizations official">[http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/site.asp?p=marketorganizations Market organizations], official Pike Place Market site. Accessed online 6 October 2008.</ref>

Established in 1973, the PDA manages 80% of the properties in the city-recognized Market Historical District. Its founding law—the Market Charter—requires it to preserve, rehabilitate and protect the Market's buildings; increase opportunities for farm and food retailing in the Market; incubate and support small and marginal businesses; and provide services for low-income people. PDA revenues derive from the Market's tenants through rent, utilities, and other property management activities.<ref name="Market organizations official" />
<ref name="Market organizations merchant">[http://www.pikeplacemerchantsassociation.com/organizations.html Organizations Directory], Pike Place Merchants Association. Accessed online 6 October 2008.</ref> 

The same 1973 charter that established the PDA also established the Pike Place Market Constituency. The Constituency elects one member to the PDA Council each year. Anyone 16 years of age or older who lives in Washington State, can become a member of the Constituency by paying US$1 yearly dues.<ref name="Market organizations official" /><ref name="Market organizations merchant" />

Operating independently of the PDA, the Market Historical Commission (established by the 1971 initiative to preserve the Market) has the specific mandate to preserve the Market's physical and social character as "the soul of Seattle."<ref name=hist-dist /> The Commission must approve any substantive change in the use or design of buildings and signage in the Historical District, even when these actions are taken by the PDA itself. Members of the 12-member commission are appointed to three-year terms by the mayor. At any time, the commission consists of two members each from the Friends of the Market, Inc., [[Allied Arts of Seattle]], Inc., and the Seattle chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]]; two owners of property within the District; two Market merchants, and two District residents. They meet 22 times a year. The Seattle Department of Neighborhoods provides them with a staff person, and the city's Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) can enforce their decisions.<ref name=Jones-5>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=5 (p. 17 of the PDF)}}</ref>

[[Image:Fruits and Vegetables at Pike Place Market.jpg|thumb|left|A typical display of fruits and vegetables in a "high stall" (an open-fronted, commercially leased space in the Market).]]

Another key organization in the affairs of the Market is the Pike Place Merchants Association.<ref name=merchants-mission>[http://www.pikeplacemerchantsassociation.com/ Mission Statement], Pike Place Merchants Association. Accessed online 6 October 2008.</ref> Officially incorporated in 1973,<ref name=Jones-22>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=22 (p. 34 of the PDF)}}</ref> it traces its history back to the Farm Association established in the 1920s. The Association connects market vendors to legal, accounting, bookkeeping, business insurance, and health insurance services<ref name=merchants-mission /> and provides free online advertising for its members. It also represents its members and attempts to advance their interests and opinions. All PDA tenants are required to be members; daystall vendors also have the option to join.<ref name=Jones-22 /> Since 1974, the Association has published the monthly ''Pike Place Market News'', which promotes the Market and its neighborhood.<ref name="Market organizations merchant" /> For over three decades, the Association sponsored a [[Memorial Day]] fair at the market; financial difficulties caused cancellation of the fair in 2004.<ref>Kathy Mulady, [http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/175378_market28.html Pike Place Market's money woes cancel annual Memorial Day festival], ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', May 28, 2004. Accessed online 7 October 2008.</ref>

A separate Daystall Tenants Association (DTA) formed in the late 1980s to represent the specific interests of daystall vendors. The DTA formed in response to proposed increases in daystall rental rates. Most members pay a US$2 annual membership fee; the fee is optional. The DTA meets on the Desimone Bridge in the Market at least once each quarter and "as needed". Similarly, the United Farmers Coalition (UFC) formed in 1998 to represent daystall farmers who sell produce, flower, and processed food; the UFC represents only these food vendors, as against craft vendors.<ref name=Jones-22 /> The Pike Market Performers' Guild, founded 2001, represents Market street performers.<ref>[http://www.pikemarketbuskers.org/ Home page], Pike Market Performers' Guild official site.

===Conflicts===
[[Image:Pike Place Market - apples for sale.jpg|thumb|Farmer selling apples in a daystall.]]
The PDA is a public trustee charged with many potentially conflicting goals. Its charter mandates it to "ensure that the traditional character of the Public Market is preserved." It is specifically mandated to 

<blockquote>...afford... a continuing opportunity for Public Market farmers, merchants, residents, shoppers, and visitors to carry on their tradition and market activities...  upgrad[e] structures and public amenities... initiate programs to expand food retailing in the Market Historical District, especially the sale of local farm produce; to preserve and expand the residential community, especially for low-income people; to promote the survival and predominance of small shops, marginal businesses, thrift shops, arts and crafts, and other enterprises, activities, and services which are essential to the functioning of the Public Market.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=3 (p. 15 of the PDF)}}</ref></blockquote>

The City Auditor's office has stated that there is an "inherent conflict... between the PDA's need to operate the Market as a successful business entity and its Charter obligation to support small owner-operated tenant businesses."<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=40 (p. 52 of the PDF)}}</ref> As early as 1974, a Seattle Department of Community Development study noted space conflicts between farmers and craft vendors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=12 (p. 24 of the PDF)}}</ref> Conflicts can be exacerbated because the stakeholders with conflicting needs are not talking to one another. Quoting the same City Auditor's report:

[[Image:PikePlaceMarket2006.jpg|thumb|left|A fishmonger's stall in the Main Arcade. Open-fronted, but rented on a lease, not as a daystall.]]
<blockquote>Most Market tenants do not routinely communicate with tenants in other areas of the Market. As a result, they sometimes criticize the PDA for not implementing suggestions they believe would work for them and their close neighbors--e.g., closing all or part of Pike Place to auto traffic--not realizing that their “solutions” would create problems for tenants in other parts of the Market. Then they conclude that the PDA is not taking their comments and suggestions seriously.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=''vi'' (p. 10 of the PDF)}}</ref></blockquote>

Language barriers also play a role. For example, most of the flower vendors in the Market are [[Hmong people|H'mong]]; during the difficult negotiations in 1999 over replacing the Hildt Agreement, many were apparently under a misimpression that the proposed agreement would have halved the vending space they received for a day's rent; in fact, this was unchanged.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=31 (p. 43 of the PDF)}}</ref>

Further, the farmers who were the Market's original ''raison d'etre'' do not necessarily do well when the Market becomes more of a tourist attraction than venue for shopping for produce and groceries.<ref name="Seattle Times May 27 2008">{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004440068_pikeplace27m.html|title=Pike Place Market becoming less-fertile ground for farmers|publisher=Seattle Times|year=2008|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> "Craft vendors, antique and curio merchants, and booksellers…" wrote the City Auditor's office, "derive much of their business from tourists; fresh food vendors do not."<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=57 (p. 69 of the PDF)}}</ref> Conversely, farmers have far more selling opportunities outside the Market than in the early and mid-20th century. As late as 1990, there were about ten farmers markets in Washington. By 1999 there were more than sixty. Most are seasonal weekend markets without most of the Pike Place Market's amenities, but they are not swarmed with tourists, parking is free or inexpensive parking and relatively plentiful, and food is the main focus of those markets, not crafts or flowers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=15 (p. 27 of the PDF)}}</ref>

As a result, increasingly Pike Place Market daystalls are devoted to flowers and crafts rather than edible produce. "The Market," wrote the City Auditor's office, 
<blockquote> can be “lost” in either of two ways: It can stray from its traditional character or it can fail financially as a business entity. If the Market is to survive and thrive as a business entity in the face of increasing competition from other farmers’ markets, modern full-service grocery stores, and retail shopping destinations in Seattle’s Central Business District, the PDA must strike a balance between the Market’s original old-world market character and modern business practices.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=34 (p. 46 of the PDF)}}</ref></blockquote>

===Policies===
[[Image:Pike Place Market - Chop carver.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] (chop) carver at an outdoor craft daystall on Pike Place just south of Virginia Street.]]
The Market's "Meet the Producer" mandate now includes craftspeople as well as farmers. Both can rent daystalls. Farmers take historic precedence, but the PDA "acknowledges the rightful and permanent position of handmade arts and crafts as an integral use of the Market's Daystalls" and their rules seek to encourage a lively mix.<ref name=regs-3>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=3}}</ref> Some "grandfathered" vendors are allowed to sell merchandise not of their own making on essentially the same terms as craftspeople.<ref name=regs-4>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=4}}</ref> Currently, there are rules to make sure that new crafts vendors demonstrate themselves to be skilled craftspeople making their own wares with minimal use of assistants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=29–33, 46–53}}</ref> 

A standard Farm Table consists of two adjacent daystalls; a standard Craft Table is a single daystall. Daystalls are between {{convert|4|ft|m}} and {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} wide. Craftspeople have priority on the Desimone Bridge, the west side of the Market arcade north of the Desimone Bridge and the outdoor slabs between the arcade and Virginia Street; farmers have priority everywhere else. If farmers do not fill their priority tables, craftspeople may rent those, and ''vice versa''.<ref name=regs-4 /> Priority is further set by separate seniority lists, one for farmers and one for craftspeople.<ref name=regs-6>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=6}}</ref> For farmers, other factors besides seniority come into play, mainly how often the person sells at the Market. Farmers can pass permits through their family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=26–28}}</ref> The rules for joint and family crafts businesses are far more complex.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=30–33}}</ref>

While farmers and craftspeople may make some use of "agents" to sell on their behalf (including vendors functioning on different days as one another's agents), in order to maintain their seniority farmers must be physically present one day a week and craftspeople two days a week. To sell on a Saturday, vendors must sell at the Market a minimum of two weekdays of the preceding week. There are also allowances for taking vacations and sabbaticals without losing one's seniority. Senior Crafts Permit Holders—craftspeople who have sold in the Market for 30 years or more—need only rent (and use) a daystall once a week to maintain their seniority.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=11–13, 16}}</ref>

[[Image:13 Pike Place Market flower vendor displays.jpg|thumb|left|Flowers for sale in Main Arcade daystalls, 2008.]]
The definition of permitted farm products includes (among other items) produce, flowers, eggs, cultivated mushrooms, meat, cultured shellfish, and dairy products. There is also a broader category of supplemental farm products such as wild-harvested berries and mushrooms, non-edible bee products, or holiday wreaths. These may be sold in conjunction with permitted farm products, but there are strict limitations to prevent these from becoming anyone's primary products. Rules vary significantly at different times of year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=24–26}}</ref>

Farmers, craftspeople, and performers all must pay for an annual permit. As of 2008, the fee is $35 for farmers and craftspeople, $30 for performers. Craftspeople who vend "off season"—January through March—pay an additional $35 for a separate permit. For performers, this annual fee is their only fee. Farmers and craftspeople pay day rent for any daystalls they use. Depending on the season and the day of the week, a daystall may rent for anywhere from $5.60 for a stall on a Monday-Thursday off season to $32.60 on a Sunday in peak season. There are also separate rents for lockers and coolers.<ref name=regs-7>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=7}}</ref>

Compared to farmers and craftspeople, performers have a lesser role in the Market, but still one formally recognized by the PDA. "The PDA's mission with regard to performers is to maintain locations within the Market where performing artists may entertain Market shoppers in a fashion consistent with and complimentary (''sic'') to the needs of the Market's commercial business activities and Market residents.<ref name=regs-3 /> Performers may receive donations and may display their recordings for sale, but prohibited from active solicitation of donations and from active sale of "any product associated with the performance".<ref name=regs-6 />

In keeping with their lack of day fees, individual performers are not assigned specific places and times to perform. There are only positions in a (virtual) "line" or "queue" for each marked, sanctioned performance location. Queuing runs on an honor system. Each performance is limited to one hour if any other licensed performer is waiting for the spot. Electronic amplification is not allowed, nor are brass instruments or drums. Certain performance locations are further limited to "quiet" performances where (for example) even hand-clap percussion is not allowed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pike Place Market|2008|p=40–45}}</ref>

Although they do not have the same strict requirements as for daystalls, most "commercial" Market merchants are owner-operated businesses.<ref name=Jones-42>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=42 (p. 54 of the PDF)}}</ref> In the 1970s, when the Market was undergoing extensive rehabilitation and the future of the Market was somewhat unstable, the PDA consolidated its merchant base by giving merchant tenants very favorable leases, with longer terms and lower rates than were available elsewhere in Downtown Seattle. This policy was part of the reason that the PDA ran into the financial difficulties that led to its dealings with the Urban Group. The PDA now gives below-market rates only to start-up businesses, businesses or organizations designed to serve low and moderate income persons, and to "the Market’s unique character-defining businesses."<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=35 (p. 47 of the PDF)}}</ref> The latter include produce, fish, and meat businesses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=36 (p. 48 of the PDF)}}</ref> The PDA often will not renew multi-year leases for businesses with poor sales performance or other problems, but typically will allow them to remain indefinitely on a month-to-month basis.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=41 (p. 53 of the PDF)}}</ref> About once a year, the PDA has occasion to refuse to renew when a merchant's lease ends.<ref name=Jones-42/>

===Housing and social services===

The Market is also a significant provider of low-income housing and social services. The Market Foundation supports the Pike Market Medical Clinic, Pike Market Senior Center, Downtown Food Bank, and Pike Market Childcare and Preschool (all within the Market), as well as [[low-income housing]] in and near the Market.<ref name=Foundation />  They provide Market Fresh coupons to their low-income tenants, redeemable for Market produce, and implement the FoodLink program that distributes unsold Market produce to other Seattle [[food bank]]s and meal programs.<ref name=Jones-5>{{Harvnb|Jones|1999|p=6 (p. 17 of the PDF)}}</ref> The money placed in the Market's [[#Rachel and Pigs on Parade|giant piggybank]] goes to this foundation, as do the funds raised by several annual or intermittent fundraisers, including [[#Rachel and Pigs on Parade|Pigs on Parade]].<ref name=Foundation />

About 500 people live in the market. Approximately 90% are low-income seniors with subsidized rents. Their average income is only $6,700 a year.<ref>[http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/site.asp?p=housing Housing], Pike Place Market official site.

One third homeless, 30% are physically disabled, and 60% have severe mental illness and/or chemical addiction. The clinic provides basic medical care, subsidized prescriptions, lab work, mental health counseling, drug and alcohol counseling, connections to other community services, and sometimes even assistance in finding housing.<ref>[http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/site.asp?p=medicalclinic Medical Clinic], Pike Place Market official site.

The child care and preschool serves 90-100 families with children ages 2-5 each year. 84% of families with children attending are low-income and receive tuition assistance. Besides its educational aspects, the school provides these children with breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snacks and has a full-time, onsite child and family support professional to identify resources children their families might need and to link them to those resources.<ref>[http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/site.asp?p=childcare Childcare], Pike Place Market official site.

==Attractions==
[[Image:Pike Pl Fish Market 2002.jpg|thumb|Flying fish at the Pike Place Fish Market.]]
One of the Market's major attractions is [[Pike Place Fish Market]], where employees throw three-foot salmon and other fish to each other rather than passing them by hand. When a customer orders a fish, an employee at the Fish Market's ice-covered fish table picks up the fish and hurls it over the countertop, where another employee catches it and preps it for sale.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

According to the employees, this tradition started when the [[fishmonger]]s got tired of having to walk out to the Market's fish table to retrieve a salmon each time someone ordered one. Eventually, the owner realized it was easier to station an employee at the table, to throw the fish over the counter. The "flying fish" have appeared in an episode of the television [[sitcom]] ''[[Frasier]]'' that was shot on location and have been featured on [[The Learning Channel]] and was also in the opening credits of [[MTV]]'s ''[[The Real World: Seattle]]''.  This attraction has also appeared on numerous prime-time installments of NFL games when the [[Seattle Seahawks|Seahawks]] host games at nearby Qwest Field.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

===Dining and drinking in the Market===
While one can easily graze one's way through the Market food stalls and shops, the Pike Place Market offers numerous other eating (and drinking) options. The once endemic workingmen's and sailors' taverns are gone; at roughly opposite corners of the Market, the Virginia Inn (founded as Virginia Bar, approximately 1908; operated as a [[cardroom]] during [[Prohibition]], then Virginia Inn; passed into current management 1980 and slowly gentrified) and Place Pigalle (originally Lotus Inn, name dates from 1950s, remodeled 1982) retain their names, but both have gone upmarket.<ref name=Pigalle-hist>[http://www.placepigalle-seattle.com/history.php Place Pigalle History], Place Pigalle Restaurant and Bar official site.

For a different type of dining experience, the Pink Door (founded 1981), entered by a nearly unmarked door on upper Post Alley, is a favorite first-date restaurant, with solid Italian food, a fantasia of a dining room, a bar that sometimes features live jazz, and an outdoor deck overlooking Elliott Bay.<ref name=Enduring /><ref>Neal Schindler, [http://www.seattleweekly.com/2003-08-06/food/behind-the-pink-door/ Behind the Pink Door], ''Seattle Weekly'', August 06, 2003.

== Notable people ==
Frank Goodwin and his brothers developed most of the core Market buildings. He was largely responsible for the decision to keep ornament to a minimum, in order to keep the emphasis on the products rather than the institution and in order not to scare off people looking for good prices on their produce. Upon his retirement in 1925, his nephew Arthur Goodwin took over most of the Market ownership, selling some shares to people outside of the family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Evans|1991|p=4–6}}</ref>

[[Giuseppe Desimone|Giuseppe "Joe" Desimone]] was born about {{convert|40|mi|km}} east of [[Naples]], Italy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Evans|1991|p=9}}</ref> He arrived in America from Italy as a stowaway, but soon became a successful farmer with land in [[South Park, Seattle, Washington|South Park]], [[Tukwila, Washington|Tukwila]] and the [[Kent, Washington|Kent]] Valley along the [[Green River (Washington)|Green River]]. A longtime Market vendor, was one of those who bought shares in the Market in 1925, and eventually became its owner by slowly buying out Arthur Goodwin. He was president of the Market until his death in 1946. Outside of the Market, he is credited with keeping [[Boeing]] in the Seattle area in 1936 by selling them a large tract of land for a nominal fee.<ref name=Crowley-1999 /><ref name=Desimone>Joe Desimone, [http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/site.asp?p=featuredstories The Desimone Connection to the Pike Place Market], Pike Place Market official site, July 25, 2007. Joe Desimone who wrote this piece is Giuseppe's grandson and Richard's son. Accessed online 12 October 2008.</ref>

His son Richard Desimone succeeded him as president of the market and served in that position until 1974. He kept the Market alive in dark times for farmers' markets, doing nearly all business on handshake deals rather than through formal leases. He later served on the Market Historical Commission.<ref name=Crowley-1999 /><ref name=Desimone />

[[Victor Steinbrueck]] was the leading architect-activist in defining the Pike Market neighborhood, and artist [[Mark Tobey]] in visualizing and recording, in developing his "Northwest Mystic" style of the internationally-recognized Northwest School of art. Internationally recognized in the 1940s, Tobey explored the neighborhood with his art in the 1950s and early 1960s,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lehmann|2001}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Long|2002}}</ref> as the area was being increasingly characterized by the Seattle Establishment as overdue for [[urban renewal]], particularly replacement with a parking garage, high-rise housing and modern, upscale retail.<ref name=Crowley-1999 /> People of city neighborhoods and citizen preservation activists struggled through the 1960s, culminating in 1971 with 2 to 1 passage of a citizen initiative for protection and citizen oversight of the core Pike Place Market that has since largely protected the neighborhood.<ref name=Crowley-1999 /><ref name=Lange-1999>{{Harvnb|Lange|1999}}</ref><ref name=Wilma-1999>{{Harvnb|Wilma|1999}}</ref> 

[[George Rolfe]], the first director of the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA), played a key role in the economic revitalization of the Market after it was saved by the 1971 referendum. It was under his management that the direction of automobile traffic on Pike Place was reversed and the pedestrian-friendly brick paving was introduced. Rolfe also emphasized the construction of pedestrian routes to the waterfront so that the Market became the center of a pedestrian network. 

For many years, Sol "The Cod Father" Amon of Pure Food Fish has been the longest-tenured vendor at Pike Place Market. His father, Jack Amon, began selling fish in the Market in 1911 as a partner in the Philadelphia Fish Market. From about 1920 to 1935, he owned and operated the American Fish Company. In 1951 he bought the Pure Food Fish Company (founded 1917–1918), which Sol Amon largely took over in 1956. Sol had worked in the Market since 1947 and has been sole proprietor of Pure Food Fish since his father's death in 1966. He can often be seen outside his stall chatting with visitors and helping them choose their fish, including a brisk tourist trade in salmon packed to travel. The [[Seattle City Council]] honored him in 2006 on the 50th anniversary of his taking over the business: they named him "King of the Market" and permanently designated April 11 as Sol Amon Day. Amon is a longtime major supporter of the Market Foundation. On the first Sol Amon Day in 2006, Amon donated all of the day's profits from Pure Food Fish to the Foundation.<ref>Erik Lacitis, [http://www.freshseafood.com/Articles_Newsletters/ArticlePage.aspx?pageId=63 Selling fish still his "first love"], ''Seattle Times'', May 1, 2007, <!-- page # would be good, because it is not on ''Seattle Times'' web site --> reproduced on FreshSeafood.com, accessed 1 February 2008.</ref><ref>"King Gets His Day", [http://pikeplacemerchantsassociation.com/News/April_06/ppmn_April_06_web.pdf Pike Place Market News, April 2006], Pike Place Market Merchant Association, p. 2.

== Notable buildings ==
Few of the historic buildings in the Pike-Market neighborhood (and none of the Market buildings as such) are individually designated as landmarks or registered as historic places. Buildings included in the federally and locally designated historic districts gain most of the benefits that would accrue from individual designation, so there is little reason to go through the difficult process of obtaining separate designation.

===Market buildings===
[[Image:Pike-place-market.jpg|thumb|left|Pike Place Market, looking southwest on Pike Street from First Avenue. The building at right with the "Meet the Producer" sign is the Leland Hotel, surrounded by the Main Arcade. Left of the Market's neon sign is the LaSalle Hotel. At extreme left is part of the Economy Market.]]

The Market began on a boardwalk adjacent to the 3-story Leland Hotel<ref name=Crowley-1999 /> (1900, architect unknown). The Leland was incorporated in 1907 by engineer John Goodwin into the Main Arcade. In 1914–1915 he and architect Andrew Willatsen extended this complex further into the Fairley Building, which includes Lowell's, the Athenian, and the "Down Under". The complex was rehabilitated in 1977 by George Bartholick. As of 2008, the upper two stories of the Leland continue to be housing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elenga|2007|p=151–152}}</ref><ref name=Crowley-1999 /><ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|Dorpat|1998|p=86}}</ref> Together, all of these constitute today's Main Market.

The two-story Triangle Market (Thompson & Thompson, 1908; rehabilition by Fred Bassetti & Co., 1977) originally housed the South Park Poultry Company. The 1977 rehabilitation joined it with the adjacent 3-story Silver Oakum Building (unknown, 1910; Bassetti, 1977).<ref>{{Harvnb|Elenga|2007|p=159}}</ref> The Outlook Hotel (now LaSalle Hotel; architect unknown; rehabilitation by Bartholick, 1977) also dates from 1908. A legitimate seaman's and workingman's hotel until 1942, its [[Japanese American]] operators Rosuke and T.K. Kodama were forcibly [[Japanese American internment|interned]] during World War II. Nellie Curtis took it over, changed the name, and ran it as a brothel into the 1950s. Since 1977 the building has been joined to the adjacent Cliff House (c. 1901), and largely devoted to low-income housing. Shops and the Market PDA office are on the ground floor.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elenga|2007|p=151}}</ref><ref name=Pigalle-hist/> Its roof provides outdoor seating for the restaurant Maximilien.<ref>John Livingston, "Maximilien: Another Amazing Market View", ''Pike Place Market News'', [http://pikeplacemerchantsassociation.com/News/Aug_06/ppmn_Aug_06_web.pdf Volume 32, Issue #8], August 2006, p. 7.

The Sanitary Market (Daniel Huntington, 1910; reconstructed 1942, McClelland and Jones; rehabilitated and extended 1981, Bassetti Norton Metler) reputedly was so named for its innovation at the time, that no horses were allowed inside. A fire on December 15, 1941, eight days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], severely damaged the building. Although the true cause of the fire was never determined, newspapers at the time speculated that the Japanese were to blame. The building was reconstructed as a 2-story building with rooftop parking. Nearly four decades later the parking lot was eliminated, replaced by two floors of residences.<ref name=Crowley-1999 /><ref>{{Harvnb|Elenga|2007|p=153}}</ref><ref>[http://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/imlsmohai&CISOPTR=3821&CISOBOX=1&REC=6 Fire at Corner Market Building, Pike Place Market, Seattle, 1941], Digital Collections, University of Washington Libraries.

The North Arcade (1911 and 1922, John Goodwin; rehabilitation by Bartholick, 1977) constituted a major northward extension of the Main Market, extending it {{convert|1200|ft|m}} to the northwest and adding 160 covered stalls.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elenga|2007|p=159–160}}</ref>

The 3-story Corner Market building (Harlan Thomas & Clyde Grainger 1912; rehabilitation by Karlis Rekevics, 1975) sits on the right as one enters the Market along Pike Street. In its early years it included daystalls, and the businesses facing onto First Avenue were open-fronted. The Three Girls Bakery, the first known business in the Corner Market, is now located in the adjacent Sanitary Market. The basement was home to Patti Summers' jazz club for over two decades before becoming Can Can in 2006; the building is also home to [[anarchism|anarchist]] bookstore Left Bank Books, as well as numerous other businesses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elenga|2007|p=153}}</ref><ref>Tizzy Asher, [http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/262381_club10.html The Club Scene: Can Can opens in Patti Summers' former jazz joint], ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', March 10, 2006.

Across Pike Street from the Corner Market is the Economy Market (unknown, 1900, as Bartell Building; remodeled by John Goodwin & Andrew Willatsen 1916; rehabilitation by Bartholick, 1978). The 1978 rehabilitation occurred in conjunction with the construction of the adjacent South Arcade<ref>{{Harvnb|Elenga|2007|p=149}}</ref> at the corner of First Avenue and Union Street (Olsen / Walker, 1985). The South Arcade lies outside of the protected historic Market areas. It includes [[condominium]] apartments, but also the Pike Pub & Brewery and several other retail businesses of a similar character to those within the Market boundaries.
