==Early Congressional career==

After several years as physician, Paul became a [[delegate]] to the 1974 Texas Republican [[Political convention|convention]]. He had decided to enter politics on [[August 15]], [[1971]], when [[President]] [[Richard Nixon]] advocated the U.S. dollar's complete departure from the [[gold standard]].

[[Image:Ron Paul and Reagan.jpg|right|frame|Ron Paul led the Texas Delegation to nominate [[Ronald Reagan]] (left to right: Ron Paul, [[Jack Fields]], Ronald Reagan, and [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]])]]

Paul was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress from the 22nd district of Texas in 1974, against incumbent Democrat [[Robert R. Casey]], in an election where Democratic candidates won heavily. When [[President]] [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Casey as head of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], Paul won an [[April]] [[1976]] [[special election]] to fill the empty seat. Paul lost six months later in the [[general election]], to Democrat [[Robert Gammage|Robert A.

Paul served on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]], speaking against the inflation he saw as due to the [[Federal Reserve]],<ref name="2008bio"/> and against the deregulation of banking rules that allowed for the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980's.<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/> The U.S. Gold Commission created by Congress in 1982 was his idea, and his conclusions from the commission were published by the [[Cato Institute]] as a book, ''The Case for Gold''.<ref name="gold">{{cite web | work = J.

Paul said he sought to do more during his presidential run than reach office — he was spreading his liberty-minded ideas, often talking to groups of school and university students, whether or not they were old enough to vote: "We're just as interested in the future generation as this election. These kids will vote eventually, and maybe, just maybe, they'll go home and talk to their parents."<ref name="1988nytimes"/> He traveled the country for a year speaking about issues such as [[free market]] economics and the rising government deficits.<ref name="economist1988"/> He said, "That's why we talk to a lot of young people.

==Newsletter article controversy==

A 1992 issue of the ''Ron Paul Survival Report'' (published by Paul since 1985) included derogatory comments concerning race and politicians.<ref>{{cite news | title = CAMPAIGN '96 U.S. HOUSE: Newsletter excerpts offer ammunition to Paul's opponent: GOP hopeful quoted on race, crime | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20070512114222/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html | first = Alan | last = Bernstein | work = Houston Chronicle | date = 1996-05-22 | accessdate = 2007-05-20}}</ref> It accused [[President]] [[Bill Clinton]] of fathering [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate children]] and using [[cocaine]], and called [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Barbara Jordan]] a "fraud" and a "half-educated victimologist". The newsletter said government should lower the [[Defense of infancy|legal age for prosecuting youths as adults]], positing that some "black males age 13 ... are as big, strong, tough, scary and culpable as any adult" and that they can be "unbelievably fleet-footed" while committing crimes; it characterized 95% of [[Washington, D.C.]], black males as "semi-criminal or entirely criminal" and only 5% of blacks as "sensible". It also held that "complex embezzling" was a "100 percent white and Asian" crime and called Israelis a lobby "of the bad sort".<ref>{{cite news | last = Searcy | first = R | date = 2007-06-03 | url = http://www.atlantaprogressivenews.com/views/0024-views.html | title = The Ron Paul that Ron Paul Doesn't Want You to Know | work = Atlanta Progressive News}}</ref>

In 2001, Paul took "moral responsibility for" the comments printed in his newsletter under his name, explaining they were written by a [[ghostwriter|guest writer]] and did not represent his views. He said the remarks referring to Rep. Jordan were "the saddest thing, because Barbara and I served together and actually she was a delightful lady."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=41822 | title = Ron Paul Race Smear Erased? | date = 2007-05-22 | work = Free Market News | publisher = Free Market News Network}}</ref> ''Texas Monthly'' magazine defended Paul's decision to protect the writer's confidence during previous campaigns, concluding, "Even more puzzling was that, in four terms as a U.S. congressman and one presidential race, Paul had never uttered anything remotely like this."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

==Later Congressional career==

===Campaigns===

[[Image:Ron paul.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Paul's Congressional portrait]]

In 1996, Paul returned to Congress after a tougher battle than he had faced in the 1970's. He was hopeful of being more effective in Congress after the Republicans took over both houses of Congress in the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 election]].<ref name="paulsneary"/> His primary opponent, [[Greg Laughlin]], had support from Republican leaders, including House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="campaign1996"/> Incumbent Laughlin had switched from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to the Republican side the year before, and the [[Republican National Committee]], hoping to encourage other Democrats to switch parties, threw its full support behind Laughlin. Despite these efforts by the national party, the [[NRA|National Rifle Association]], and other interest groups, challenger Paul won the primary. It became the third time he had been elected to Congress as a non-incumbent.<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/>

While Gingrich and other Republican leaders visited the district stumping for Laughlin, Paul ran newspaper ads quoting Gingrich's harsh criticisms of Laughlin's voting record 14 months earlier, before Laughlin had switched parties.<ref name="campaign1996"/> Baseball pitcher (and constituent) [[Nolan Ryan]], a friend of Paul's, served as his honorary campaign chair and appeared in ads for him, and tax activist [[Steve Forbes]] also supported Paul's candidacy.<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/><ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> Paul continued to maintain his home in Lake Jackson, but ran for the coastal 14th Congressional district rather than the 22nd district he had previously represented, due to redistricting borders.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ao.nictusa.com/ao/no/900023.html | title = Federal Election Commission Advisory Opinion Number 1990-23 | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | last = Elliott | first = Lee Ann | date= 1990-11-05 | publisher= Federal Election Commission}}</ref>

His Democratic opponent in the fall election, trial [[lawyer]] Charles "Lefty" Morris, lost in a close margin, despite assistance from the [[AFL-CIO|American Federation of Labor]] and running numerous attacks citing Paul's 1992 newsletter and his past votes to repeal federal [[Prohibition (drugs)|drug laws]] in favor of state legislation. Paul in turn labeled Morris a pawn of trial lawyers and big labor, and raised more money than Morris, with the help of his national network of donors: $1.2 million to Morris's less than $0.5 million. Ken Bryan, a Democratic consultant to some of Paul's opponents, has said, "He has one of the largest contributor bases in Congress, outside of the leadership." Most of Paul's contributions are given in small amounts by individuals.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> That year, he had the third-highest amount of individual contributions of any House member, behind Gingrich and [[Bob Dornan]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html | title = Paul for President?: The maverick libertarian Republican talks on war, immigration, and presidential ambition | accessdate = 2007-05-28 | last = Doherty | first = Brian | date = 2007-01-22 | work = Reason}}</ref>

In 1998 Paul again won the primary and the election, outraising his opponent by a large margin, $2.1 million to $0.7 million. Opposing a Democratic rice farmer and former [[Matagorda County, Texas|Matagorda County]] judge, Loy Sneary, Paul won by 11%; he ran ads warning voters to be "leery of Sneary".<ref name="saynot">{{cite web | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800966_2.html | title = Congressman Paul's Legislative Strategy?

Sneary's aides said he had voted to raise all county employees' pay by 5% in a "cost of living" increase. Paul countered that he had never voted to raise Congressional pay.<ref name="paulsneary"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story.mpl/content/chronicle/metropolitan/98/08/15/notebook.2-0.html | title = Foes lock horns over Paul's radio ads | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | date = 1998-08-14 | work = Campaign Notebook | publisher = Houston Chronicle}}</ref>

In 2000, Sneary ran against Paul again, with Paul winning 60% to 40% and raising $2.4 million to Sneary's $1.1 million.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> Paul was re-elected in 2002, in 2004 (unopposed), and in 2006 to his tenth term (by 20%),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//pages/results/states/TX/index.html | title = State Races: Texas | accessdate = 2007-03-04 | work = Elections 2006 | publisher= Cable News Network}}</ref> outraising his opponent $1.2 million to $0.6 million.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thevictoriaadvocate.com/330/story/72352.html | title = Shane Sklar won't run against Paul in 2008 | accessdate = 2007-06-14 | work = Elections 2008 | publisher = Victoria Advocate}}</ref> He has drawn two primary challengers in the 2008 election: Eric Dondero, a former aide fired by Paul,<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://reason.com/blog/show/120230.html | title = Blowback, Texas-Style | accessdate= 2007-07-11 | work= Reason}}</ref> and Chris Peden, a [[Friendswood, Texas|Friendswood]] city councilman.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA052207.EN.PAUL.94898f61.html | title = Paul gets primary challenger | accessdate = 2007-07-11 | work = San Antonio Express-News}}</ref>

===Relationship with district===

Paul continued to work as an [[obstetrician]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]], [[Texas]], even while serving in [[United States Congress|Congress]], delivering many of his constituents' babies. As of 2001, he was one of few doctors in the House (eight, including dentists) and part of an even smaller group that continued to practice while in office. Journalists have reported that it is not unusual for younger people in his home district to approach the Congressman and say that he delivered them.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Paul opposes some forms of legislation that coastal or rural members of Congress typically support. Paul's district in Texas is larger in size than [[Massachusetts]],<ref name="washpost96">{{cite news | title = GOP House Candidate Responds to Charges | accessdate = 2007-09-11 | last = Pressley | first = Sue Ann | date = 1996-05-26 | work = Washington Post}}</ref> borders the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with 675 miles (1100 kilometers) of coastline, and also includes suburbs of [[Houston]]; it was [[2003 Texas redistricting|redistricted]] prior to the 2004 election. Paul is opposed to federally funded [[flood insurance]] because it requires those who do not live near [[flood]] zones to subsidize those who choose to live in an area that is prone to flooding, and does not allow those in flood zones to choose their own insurer. In an "overwhelmingly rural region", Paul opposes farm subsidies because they go to big corporations rather than small farmers. Despite voting against bills with large support in Congress, such as the farm bill, the Congressman's "contrarian nature" and devotion to lowering taxes has continuously appealed to 14th district voters.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> One survey conducted by Paul of the constituency found that 54% agreed with his goal of eliminating the federal [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst97/tst072097.htm | title = Parents must have control of education | accessdate = 2007-09-13 | last = Paul | first = Ron | date = 1997-07-20 | work = Texas Straight Talk | publisher = House of Representatives}}</ref>

While Paul votes against most spending bills, he has diverted funds that have already been authorized by other bills into his own district.<ref name="wsj2003">{{cite web | url = http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB104725224693862700.html | title = A Far-Right Texan Inspires Antiwar Left | accessdate = 2007-06-15 | last = Murray | first = Shailagh | date = 2003-03-10 | work = Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Paul spends extra time in the district addressing constituents' concerns, to compensate for "violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of",<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> sometimes three to four days a week, often accompanied by grandchildren. He attends graduations, civic ceremonies, and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] honor ceremonies. In an expansive district, he often logs over 300 miles (500 kilometers) daily, visiting [[constituents]] or handling their concerns. He reaches out to 14th district voters on veterans' issues, such as procuring medals for war veterans who lost or never received their medals, and holding medal ceremonies for those whose medals are being presented. He has helped senior citizens of the district get free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program; his staff sends out birthday cards to constituents, as well as [[condolence]] cards on the deaths of family members.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

===Legislation===

Paul sponsors many more bills than the average representative, such as those that would abolish the [[income tax]]<ref name="endirs"/> or the [[Federal Reserve]]; many do not escape committee review. Nevertheless, he has been named one of the "50 Most Effective Members of Congress" by ''Congressional Quarterly''.<ref name="ronpaulis">{{cite web | url = http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/ronpaulis.html | title = Ron Paul Is… | accessdate = 2007-06-15 | publisher = Ron Paul for Congress}}</ref> He has sponsored successful legislation to prevent the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] from seizing a church in New York through [[eminent domain]], and a bill transferring ownership of the [[Lake Texana]] dam project from the federal government to [[Texas]].<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Paul has introduced bills that would apply a $5,000 tax credit per child towards spending on any type of children's education–related expenses, [[public education|public]], [[Private education#North America|private]], or [[Homeschooling|homeschool]]. He has introduced the [[Family Education Freedom Act]] in every Congressional session since 1997; the bill currently has six co-sponsors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hslda.org/legislation/national/2001/HR368/default.asp | title = H.R. 368 – Family Education Freedom Act of 2001 | accessdate = 2007-09-13 | date = 2002-06-27 | publisher = Home School Legal Defense Assocation}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_HR_1056.html | title = H.R. 1056, The Family Education Freedom Act of 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-13 | publisher = Washington Watch}}</ref> He has also introduced companion legislation in the form of the [[Teacher Tax Cut Act]], which would provide all elementary and secondary school teachers with a $1,000 tax cut, and the Professional Educators Tax Relief Act, which would give all K-12 school librarians, counselors, and other personnel the same $1,000 tax credit.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2003/cr021103d.htm | title = Teacher Tax Cut Act | accessdate = 2007-09-14 | publisher = House of Representatives | work = Congressional Record}}</ref> He has also introduced the [[Education Improvement Tax Cut Act]], which would allow $5,000 deductions for any type of donations to scholarships or to benefit academics at any school.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.educationpolicy.org/newsletter/EEMar99.htm | title = Rep. Paul Introduces Education Package | accessdate = 2007-09-14 | date = 1999-03 | work= Education Exchange | publisher = Education Policy}}</ref>

In [[March 2001]], Paul introduced the "Constitutional War Powers Resolution of 2001", which would repeal the 1973 [[War Powers Resolution]] (WPR) and thus prohibit presidents from initiating a war without a formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war by Congress]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22022 | title = Bill would restore Congress' war powers | accessdate = 2007-06-13 | first = Jon | last= Dougherty | date = 2001-03-13 | work = WorldNetDaily}}</ref> Later in 2001, however, Paul voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force]], which authorized the president, pursuant to WPR, to respond to those responsible for the [[2001]] [[World Trade Center]] terror attack.<ref name="AUMF">{{cite web | title = Key Vote (How all members voted) Authorization for Use of Military Force | url = http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_keyvote_member.php?cs_id=V3064 | publisher = Project Vote Smart | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref> In order to prevent Congress from yielding its Constitutional authority to declare war to the executive branch, which does not Constitutionally hold that power, Paul introduced legislation in [[October 2002]] giving Congress the opportunity to declare war on [[Iraq]], rather than merely "authorizing" the president to deploy forces without a declaration of war. He said he would not vote for his own bill, but if his fellow members of Congress wished to go to war in Iraq, they should follow the Constitution and declare war. As one of six Republicans to vote against the Iraq War Resolution, Paul inspired the founding of a group called the National Peace Lobby Project to promote a resolution he and Oregon representative [[Peter DeFazio]] sponsored to repeal the war authorization in February 2003. His speech, 35 "Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq",<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr091002.htm | title = Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq | accessdate = 2007-07-12 | first = Ron | last = Paul | date = 2002-09-10 | publisher= House of Representatives | work = Congressional Record}}</ref> was translated and published in German, French, Russian, Italian, and Swiss publications before the Iraq War began.<ref name="wsj2003"/>

Paul says his fellow members of Congress have increased government spending by 75 percent during [[George W. Bush]]'s administration.<ref name="endirs"/> After a 2005 bill was touted as "slashing" government waste, Paul wrote that it decreased spending by a fraction of one percent and that "Congress couldn't slash spending if the members' lives depended on it."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul287.html | title = Too Little Too Late | accessdate = 2007-06-13 | first = Ron | last = Paul | date = 2005-11-15 | publisher = Lew Rockwell}}</ref> Paul said that between 2001 and early 2004 he had voted against more than 700 bills intended to expand government.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lewrockwell.com/yates/yates92.html | title = An Evening With Dr. Ron Paul | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | first = Steven | last = Yates, Ph.D. | date = 2004-04-07 | publisher = Lew Rockwell}}</ref>

Paul charged his fellow legislators with voting for the Patriot Act without reading it first; more than 300 pages long, it was enacted into law less than 24 hours after being introduced. In response to such Congressional actions, Paul introduced "Sunlight Rule" legislation, which would not allow votes on legislation to occur until ten days after its introduction, with the intent of giving lawmakers enough time to read bills before voting on them. The bill requires allotting 72 hours for House members and staff to examine the contents of amendments.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2007/tst091607.htm | title = The Sunlight Rule | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | first = Ron | last = Paul | date = 2007-09-16 | publisher = House of Representatives | work = Texas Straight Talk}}</ref>

In 2005 and 2007, Paul introduced the Sanctity of Life Act, which would provide that human life exists from conception, removing abortion from federal jurisdiction and effectively negating [[''Roe v. Wade'']].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h109-776 | title = H.R. 776 of the 109th Congress, "Sanctity of Life Act of 2005"}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.1094.IH: | title = Sanctity of Life Act of 2007 | publisher = Thomas}}</ref> Paul has also introduced a Constitutional amendment with similar intent. Such laws would permit states to declare abortion to be murder and to outlaw new fetal stem cell research and some contraception and fertility treatments.<ref>{{cite news | last = Sealover | first = E | date = 2007-07-16 | url = http://www.gazette.com/articles/abortion_24888___article.html/colorado_group.html | title = Ballot initiative would outlaw abortion | work = Colorado Springs Gazette}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Stevens | first = A | date = 2007-06-10 | url = http://www.connectsavannah.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A313 | title = 'Missing angels' or misogyny? | work = Women's eNews | publisher = Connect Savannah}}</ref> Also in 2005 and 2007, Paul introduced the We the People Act, which would forbid all federal courts from adjudicating abortion as well as same-sex marriage, sexual practices, and government display of religious symbols. The Act would make federal decisions on those subjects nonbinding as state precedent, and would forbid federal courts from spending money to enforce their judgments.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h109-4379 | title = H.R. 4379 of the 109th Congress, "We the People Act" | publisher = House of Representatives}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.300: | title = We the People Act of 2007 | publisher = Thomas}}</ref>

===Affiliations===

Paul serves on the House [[United States House Committee on International Relations|International Relations Committee]] (having been on the Western Hemisphere and the Asia and Pacific subcommittees); the Joint Economic Committee; and the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services]] (as Ranking Member of the Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade and Technology subcommittee, and Vice-Chair of the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee).<ref name="officialbio">{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/bio.shtml | title = Who is Ron Paul? | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | publisher = House of Representatives}}</ref>

Paul served as honorary chair of, and is a current member of, the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]], a political action organization dedicated to promoting the ideals of individual rights, limited government and free enterprise within the Republican Party.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fl.rlc.org/ | title = RLC of Florida | accessdate = 2007-03-04 | publisher = Republican Liberty Caucus of Florida}}</ref> He also serves on the Liberty Caucus (or Liberty Committee), a group of liberty-minded representatives from both sides of the aisle,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thelibertycommittee.org/ | title = The Liberty Committee | accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref> hosting a luncheon for the Liberty Caucus every Thursday.

===Actions in Congress===

Paul was on a bipartisan coalition of 17 members of Congress that sued [[President]] [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] in 1999 over his conduct of the [[Kosovo]] war. They accused Clinton of failing to inform Congress of the action's status within 48 hours as required by [[War Powers Resolution|WPR]], and of failing to obtain Congressional declaration of war as specifically required in the Constitution. Congress had voted 427 – 2 against a declaration of war with [[Yugoslavia]], and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after Clinton had actively engaged troops in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge's decision attempted to circumvent the Constitution and to authorize the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999.htm | title = Judge sides with Clinton | accessdate = 2007-06-12 | first = Ron | last = Paul | date = 1999-06-09 | publisher = House of Representatives}}</ref>

{{main|Political positions of Ron Paul}}

Ron Paul's positions are developed from his long-standing promise that he "never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution",<ref name="2008bio"/> which has yielded many contrarian votes and his "Dr. No" reputation.
