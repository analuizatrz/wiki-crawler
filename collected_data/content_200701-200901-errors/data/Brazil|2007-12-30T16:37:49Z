'''Brazil''' ({{IPAEng|brəˈzɪl}}), officially the '''Federative Republic of Brazil''' ({{lang-pt|'''Brasil'''}} or {{lang|pt|'''República Federativa do Brasil'''}}, {{Audio|Brazil.ogg|listen}}), is a country in [[South America]].<ref name="CIA">{{cite web |title=CIA Factbook: Brazil |work=CIA Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html#Geo |accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> It is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|fifth-largest]] country by geographical area, the [[List of countries by population|fifth most populous]] country, and the fourth most populous [[democracy]] in the world.

Brazil is crossed by both the [[Equator]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]], and as such is home to a vast array fauna and flora, natural environments, as well as extensive natural resources. The Brazilian population is concentrated along the coastline and in a few large urban centers in the interior. While Brazil is one of the most populous nations in the world, [[population density]] drops dramatically as one moves inland.<ref> Théry & de Mello; ''Atlas do Brasil''; Editora USP, 2005, p. 90, ISBN 85-314-0869-5 (EDUSP)</ref>

Brazil was a colony of [[Portugal]] from its discovery by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] in 1500 until its independence in 1822. Initially independent as the Brazilian Empire, the country has been a [[republic]] since 1889, although the [[bicameral]] legislature (now called [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]]) dates back to 1824, when the first constitution was ratified. Its current [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution]] defines Brazil as a [[Federal Republic|Federative Republic]].<ref name=contituicao>{{cite web | title = Brazilian Federal Constitution | publisher = Brazilian Government (official text) | url = http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-17 }} See also: [http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html "Brazilian Federal Constitution in English"], text translated to English (unofficial).

Brazil is the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|world's 8th largest economy]] in terms of [[Purchasing power parity|purchasing power]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|10th]] largest economy at market exchange rates. The country has a diversified middle-income economy with wide variations in development levels and mature manufacturing, mining and agriculture sectors. Technology and services also play an important role and are growing rapidly. Brazil is a [[balance of trade|net exporter]], having gone through [[free trade]] and privatization reforms in the 1990s. In spite of important economical achievements, many social issues still hamper development.

Initially Portugal had little interest in Brazil, mainly because of high profits gained through commerce with [[Indochina]]. After 1530, the Portuguese Crown devised the [[Hereditary Captaincies]] system to effectively occupy its new colony, and later took direct control of the failed captaincies.<ref>Fundação Maria e Oscar Americano website, [http://www.fundacaooscaramericano.org.br/eng/Collection/Colonial_Brazil/colonial_brazil.html "Colonial Brazil"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref>CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Colonial_Brazil "Colonial Brazil"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]].</ref> The Portuguese colonists adopted an economy based on the production of agricultural goods that were exported to Europe. Sugar became by far the most important Brazilian colonial product until the early eighteenth century.<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-0117(1963)2%3A16%3A2%3C219%3AAT1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Q JSTOR: Anglo-Portuguese Trade, 1700-1770].

Retrieved on [[August 16]], [[2007]]</ref> Even though Brazilian sugar was reputed as being of high quality, the industry faced a crisis during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the Dutch and the French started producing sugar in the [[Antilles]], located much closer to Europe, causing sugar prices to fall.

During the eighteenth century, private explorers who called themselves the [[Bandeirantes]] found gold and diamond deposits in the state of Minas Gerais. The exploration of these mines were mostly used to finance the Portuguese Royal Court's debts. The predatory way in which such deposits were explored by the Portuguese Crown, however, burdened colonial Brazil with excessive taxes. Some popular movements supporting independence came about against the abusive taxes established by the colonial government, such as the [[Tiradentes]] incident in 1789, but they were often dismissed with violence by Portugal. Gold production declined towards the end of the eighteenth century, starting a period of relative stagnation of the Brazilian hinterland.<ref>Maxwell, Kenneth R.

===Empire===
{{main|Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Empire of Brazil}}

[[Image:Fala do trono (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|[[Imperial Family of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II of Brazil]], in 1873.]]

In 1808, the Portuguese court, fleeing from [[Napoleon]]’s troops which had invaded Portugal, established themselves in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. After João VI returned to Portugal in 1821, his heir-apparent [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] became regent of the Kingdom of Brazil. Following a series of [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|political incidents and disputes]], Brazil achieved its independence from Portugal on [[September 7]] [[1822]]. On [[October 12]] [[1822]], Dom Pedro became the first Emperor of Brazil, being crowned on [[December 1]] [[1822]].

In 1824, Pedro closed the Constituent Assembly, stating that the body was "endangering liberty". Pedro then produced a constitution modeled on that of Portugal (1822) and France (1814). It specified indirect elections and created the legislative, executive and judiciary branches of government; however, it also added a fourth branch, the "moderating power", to be held by the Emperor. Pedro's government was considered economically and administratively inefficient. Political pressures eventually made the Emperor step down on [[April 7]], [[1831]]. He returned to Portugal leaving behind his five-year-old son [[Pedro II]]. Until Pedro II reached maturity, Brazil was governed by regents from 1831 to 1840. The regency period was turbulent and marked by numerous local revolts including the [[Male Revolt]], the largest urban slave rebellion in the Americas, which took place in Bahia in 1835.<ref>Reis, João José. ''Slave Rebellion in Brazil - The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia''. Translated by Arthur Brakel. Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref>

On [[July 23]] [[1840]], Pedro II was crowned Emperor. His government was highlighted by a substantial rise in coffee exports, the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], and the end of [[slave trade]] from Africa in 1850, although [[slavery]] in Brazilian territory would only be abolished in 1888. When slavery was finally abolished, a large influx of European immigrants took place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/latam/SLAVERY-ABOLITION.html |title=Slavery and Abolition |date= |quote=A Journal of Comparative Studies |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://http.gogobrazil.com/angloirishpress.html |title=Links between Brazil & Ireland |date=2004 |quote= Aspects of an Economic and Political Controversy between Great Britain and Brazil, 1865-1870. |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-216X(196911)1%3A2%3C115%3ATIOBAT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S |title=JSTOR |date= |quote=The Independence of Brazil and the Abolition of the Brazilian Slave Trade: Anglo-Brazilian Relations, 1822-1826 |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> By the 1870s, the Emperor's grasp on domestic politics had started to deteriorate in face of crises with the Roman Catholic Church, the Army and the slaveholders. The Republican movement slowly gained strength. In the end, the empire fell because the dominant classes no longer needed it to protect their interests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ciaonet.org/atlas/countries/br_data_loc.html#a4 |title=CIAO Atlas |date= |quote=The Empire, 1822-89 |accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref> Indeed, imperial centralization ran counter to their desire for local autonomy. By 1889 Pedro II had stepped down and the Republican system had been adopted to Brazil.

The Brazilian Federation is based on the indissoluble association of three autonomous political entities: the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District.<ref name=contituicao/> A fourth entity originated in the aforementioned association: the Union.<ref name=contituicao/> There is no hierarchy among the political entities. The Federation is set on six fundamental principles:<ref name=contituicao/> [[sovereignty]], [[citizenship]], [[dignity]] of the people, social value of [[labor]], freedom of [[Organization|enterprise]], and [[political pluralism]]. The classic tripartite division of power, encompassing the [[Executive]], [[Legislative]] and [[Judiciary]] branches under the [[checks and balances]] system, is formally established by the Constitution.<ref name=contituicao/> The Executive and Legislative are organized independently in all four political entities, while the Judiciary is organized only in the Federal and State levels.

===Law===
{{main|Law of Brazil}}

[[Image:Ellen Gracie e Guido Mantega.jpg|right|thumb|The finance minister, [[Guido Mantega]], and the president of the [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]], [[Ellen Gracie Northfleet]].]]

Brazilian Law is based on [[Roman law|Roman]]-[[Germanic]] traditions.<ref>[http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/bra/en_bra-int-des-ordrjur.html "The Brazilian Legal System"], Organization of American States. Accessed [[May 17]], [[2007]].</ref> Thus, [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts prevail over common law practices. Most of Brazilian law is [[codified]], although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part of the system, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretation guidelines; however, they are not binding towards other specific cases except in a few situations. Doctrinal works and comments of legal academic pundits have strong influence in law creation and in legal cases.

The Federal Constitution, promulgated on [[October 5]], [[1988]], is the fundamental law of Brazil and it rules the system. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.<ref>Silva, José Afonso da; ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo''; Malheiros, 2004, p. 46, ISBN 85-7420-559-1</ref> As of April 2007, it has been through 53 Amendments. States also adopt their own Constitutions, but they must also not contradict the Federal Constitution.<ref>Silva, José Afonso da; ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo''; Malheiros, 2004, p. 592, ISBN 85-7420-559-1</ref> Municipalities and the Federal District do not have their own Constitutions; instead, they adopt "organic laws" ({{lang|pt|''leis orgânicas''}}).<ref name=contituicao/><ref>[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/government_structure/loren/ "Government structure"] Brazilian Government. Accessed [[May 17]], [[2007]].</ref> Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may also enact legal norms.<ref name=contituicao/>

[[Jurisdiction]] is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare cases, the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.<ref name=contituicao/> There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.<ref name=contituicao/> The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]]. This system has met criticism over the last decades in relation to the slow pace at which final decisions are issued. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade to see definitive rulings.<ref>Glugoski, Miguel; Medauar, Odete.

Politically, Brazil is a [[Federation]] of twenty-six [[States of Brazil|states]] ({{lang|pt|''estados''}}) and one [[Brazilian Federal District|federal district]] ({{lang|pt|''Distrito Federal''}}).

The national territory was divided in 1969 by the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), for demographic and statistical purposes, into five main regions: [[North Region, Brazil|North]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|South]].

The North region [[List of Brazilian states by area|covers 45.27% of the surface]] of Brazil, and has the [[List of Brazilian states by population|lowest number of inhabitants]]. With the exception of [[Manaus]], which hosts a tax-free industrial zone, and [[Belém]], the biggest metropolitan area of the region, it is fairly unindustrialized and undeveloped. It accommodates most of the rainforest vegetation of the world and many indigenous tribes.

The Northeast region is inhabited by about 30% of Brazil's population.<ref>{{cite web |title=IBGE - Estatísticas da população |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/estimativa2006/POP_2006_DOU.pdf |date=2006-07-01 |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2007-06-19 }}</ref> It is culturally diverse, with roots set in the Portuguese colonial period, and in Amerindian and Afro-Brazilian elements.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Brazil}}

[[Image:Amazon.A2002182.1405.1km.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Amazon Rainforest]].]]

Brazilian topography is diverse, including hills, mountains, plains, highlands, scrublands, savannas, rainforests, and a long coastline. The extensive low-lying Amazon Rainforest covers most of Brazil’s terrain in the North, whereas small hills and low mountains occupy the South. Along the Atlantic coast there are several mountain ranges, with a highest altitude of roughly 2,900&nbsp;meters ({{convert|9500|ft}}). The highest peak is the {{convert|3014|m}} [[Pico da Neblina]] (''Misty Peak'') in [[Guiana]]'s [[highland (geography)|highlands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.keadventure.com/countries/brazil/ |title=Ke Adventure |date= |quote=Adventure in Brazil |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amateur-hikers.com/highest.asp?cid=133 |title=Amateur-Hikers website |date= |quote=Highest Peaks In Brazil |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> Major rivers include the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the largest river in terms of volume of water, and the second-longest in the world; the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and its major tributary, the [[Iguaçu]] River, where the [[Iguaçu Falls]] are located; the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Negro]], [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]], [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Madeira river|Madeira]] and the [[Tapajós]] rivers. Several small islands and atolls in the Atlantic Ocean are part of Brazil: [[Abrolhos Marine National Park|Abrolhos]], Atol das Rocas, Penedos de São Pedro e São Paulo, and Trindade and Martim Vaz.

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Brazil}}

[[Image:Iguacu-001.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Iguazu Falls]] with its [[Subtropical climate]].]]

Brazil's climate has little seasonal variation since most of the country is located within the [[tropics]]. However, although 90% of the country is located within the [[tropical zone]], year-long climate varies considerably from the mostly tropical North (the equator traverses the mouth of the Amazon) to [[temperate zone]]s below the Tropic of Capricorn (23°27' S latitude), which crosses the country at the latitude of the city of São Paulo. Brazil has five climatic regions: [[equatorial]], [[tropical]], [[semiarid]], [[tropical|highland tropical]], and [[subtropical]].

Temperatures along the equator are high, with averages above {{convert|25|°C}}, and occasionally reaching the summer extremes of up to {{convert|40|°C}} in the temperate zones.<ref>El-DMC website, [http://www.el-dmc.com.br/brazil/climate.asp "Climate in Brazil"], retrieved [[January 3]], [[2006]].</ref> Southern Brazil has a subtropical temperate weather, normally experiencing frost in the winter (June-August), and occasional snow in the mountainous areas, such as [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. Temperatures in the cities of São Paulo,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world66.com/southamerica/brazil/saopaulo/lib/climate |title=São Paulo climate chart | publisher=World66 |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> Belo Horizonte,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world66.com/southamerica/brazil/belohorizonte/lib/climate |title=Belo Horizonte climate chart | publisher=World66 |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> and Brasília<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.v-brazil.com/tourism/brasilia/climate-brasilia.html |title=Weather in Brasilia | publisher=Brazil Travel |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> are moderate, usually ranging between {{convert|10|°C}} and {{convert|30|°C}}, because of their altitude of approximately {{height|m=1000}}.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] levels vary widely. They are higher in the humid [[Amazon Basin]], and lower in the somewhat arid landscapes of the northeast. Most of Brazil has moderate [[rainfall]] of 1,000 to 1,500&nbsp;millimeters a year, with most of the rain falling in the summer (between December and April), south of the Equator. The [[Amazon region]] is notoriously humid, with rainfall generally of more than 2,000&nbsp;millimeters per year, getting as high as 3,000&nbsp;millimeters in parts of the western Amazon and near Belém. Despite high annual precipitation, the Amazon rain forest has a three-to-five-month dry season, the timing of which varies according to location north or south of the equator.

===Environment===

Brazil's large area comprises different [[ecosystem]]s, which together sustain some of the world's greatest [[biodiversity]]. Because of the country's intense economic and demographic growth, Brazil's ability to protect its [[Habitat (ecology)|environmental habitats]] has increasingly come under threat.

===Energy policy===

[[Image:Itaipu Dam.jpg|right|thumb|[[Itaipu Dam]], the world's largest [[hydroelectric plant]] by energy generation.]]

Brazil is the 10th largest energy consumer in the world and the largest in [[Latin America]]. At the same time it is also a large [[oil]] and [[gas]] producer in the region and the world's largest [[ethanol]] producer. Because of its [[ethanol fuel]] production Brazil has been sometimes described as a bio-energy superpower.<ref>[http://www.tierramerica.net/2004/1030/iarticulo.shtml Brazil - A Bio-Energy Superpower], by Mario Osava, Tierramérica</ref> Brazil's ethanol fuel is produced from [[sugar cane]], the world's largest crop in both production and export tonnage.

With the [[1973 oil crisis]] the Brazilian government initiated in 1975 the Pró-Álcool program. The Pró-Álcool or ''Programa Nacional do Álcool'' (National Alcohol Program) was a nation-wide program financed by the government to replace automobile fuels derived from [[fossil fuels]] in favor of ethanol. The program successfully reduced the number of cars running on gasoline in Brazil by 10 million, thereby reducing the country's dependence on oil imports. Brazil's production and consumption of [[biodiesel]] relative to its energy matrix is expected to reach to 2% of diesel fuel in 2008 and 5% in 2013.<ref name=weo1>[[OECD]]/[[IEA]].

Technological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public [[university|universities]] and research institutes. Despite governmental regulations and incentives, investment in research and development has been growing in private universities and companies as well since the 1990s. Nonetheless, more than 73% of funding for basic research still comes from governmental sources.<ref>{{cite web |title=Skills training for growth |url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/science/categoria_view |author=Brazilian Government |accessdate=2007-08-10 }}</ref> Some of Brazil's most notables technological hubs are the [[Oswaldo Cruz Institute]], the [[Butantan Institute]], the Air Force's [[Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology (CTA)|Aerospace Technical Center]], the [[Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária|Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation]] and the INPE.

Brazil has been unable to reflect its recent economic achievements into social development. Poverty, urban violence, growing social security debts, inefficient public services, and the low value of the minimum wage are some of the main social issues that currently challenge the Brazilian government. The rate of poverty is in part attributed to the country's [[economic inequality]]. Brazil ranks among the world's highest nations in the [[Gini coefficient]] index of inequality assessment. According to [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]], in 2006 the rate of people living below the poverty line based on labour income was of 19.31% of the population<ref>{{cite book |author=Fundação Getúlio Vargas |url=http://www3.fgv.br/ibrecps/RET3/engl/index.htm |title=Poverty, Inequality and Income Policies |accessdate=2007-09-19 }}</ref> — a 33% reduction considering the previous three years.<ref>{{cite news | title =Seis milhões de brasileiros deixam a miséria | pages =1 | language =Portuguese | publisher =G1 | date =2007-09-19 | url =http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Economia_Negocios/0,,MUL107186-9356,00.html | accessdate =2007-09-19 }}</ref>

Poverty in Brazil is most visually represented by the various ''[[favela]]s'', slums in the country's metropolitan areas and remote upcountry regions that suffer with economic underdevelopment and below-par standards of living. There are also great differences in wealth and welfare between regions.

A wide variety of elements influenced Brazilian culture. Its major early influence derived from [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]], because of strong colonial ties with the [[Portuguese empire]]. Among other inheritances, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, the Roman-Germanic legal system, and the colonial architectural styles. Other aspects of Brazilian culture are contributions of European and Asian immigrants, Native South American people (such as the [[Tupi people|Tupi]]), and African slaves. Thus, Brazil is a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] and [[multiethnic society]].<ref>{{cite news | last =Rocha | first =Jan | title =Brazil's "racial democracy" | work =BBC News | publisher =BBC | date =[[2000]]-[[04-19]] | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/719134.stm | accessdate =2007-08-16 }}</ref> [[Italians|Italian]], [[Germans|German]] and other European immigrants came in large numbers and their influences are felt closer to the Southeast and South of Brazil.<ref>{{cite web | title = Immigration in Brazil | publisher = historiadobrasil.net | url = http://www.historiadobrasil.net/imigracao/ | accessdate = 2007-08-16 }}</ref> [[Indigenous people of Brazil|Amerindian]] peoples influenced Brazil's language and [[Cuisine of Brazil|cuisine]] and the [[Afro-Brazilian|Africans]], brought to Brazil as slaves, influenced [[Music of Brazil|Brazil's music]], dance, cuisine, religion and language.<ref>[[Gilberto Freyre|Freyre, Gilberto]].

In the 1950s, [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], [[Vinícius de Moraes]], [[Baden Powell de Aquino]], and [[João Gilberto]] popularized the [[Bossa Nova]] style in music. Later [[Elis Regina]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Chico Buarque]] and [[Nara Leão]] had an important role in shaping [[Música Popular Brasileira]] (literally translated as "Brazilian Popular Music," often abbreviated to MPB). In the late 1960s, [[tropicalismo]] was popularized by [[Caetano Veloso]] and [[Gilberto Gil]].

[[Brazilian Carnival]] ({{lang-pt|Carnaval}}) is an annual celebration held 40 days before [[Easter]] and marks the beginning of [[Lent]]. Brazilian Carnival has distinct regional characteristics. Other regional festivals include the [[Bumba Meu Boi|Boi Bumbá]] and [[Festa Junina]] (''June Festivals'').

Adepts of Protestantism are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were members of "traditional churches", mostly [[Lutheran]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s and [[Baptist]]s.
