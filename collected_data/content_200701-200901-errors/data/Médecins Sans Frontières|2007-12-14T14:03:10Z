'''Médecins Sans Frontières''' ({{Pronunciation|medecinssansfrontieres.ogg}}) ([[English language|English]]: '''Doctors Without Borders''', its official name in the [[United States]]) is a [[Secularism|secular]] [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian-aid]] [[non-governmental organization]] best known for its projects in war-torn regions and [[developing country|developing countries]] facing [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic disease]]. 

Médecins Sans Frontières was created in 1971 by a small group of [[France|French]] [[physician|doctor]]s (including [[Bernard Kouchner]]), in the aftermath of the [[Nigerian Civil War|Biafra secession]]. The organization is known in most of the world by its French name or simply as '''MSF''', but in the [[United States]] the name '''Doctors Without Borders''' is often used instead. <!---See Talk page about the name--->

MSF is governed by an international board of directors located in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], and organized into 20 sections. Annually, about 3,000 doctors, nurses, midwives and logisticians are recruited to run projects,<ref name="various">Information obtained from the various sections' websites.</ref> but 1,000 permanently employed staff work to recruit volunteers and handle finances and media relations. Private donors provide about 80% of the organization's funding, while governmental and corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately [[United States dollar|USD]] 400 million.<ref>Forsythe, David P. (2005) ''The Humanitarians: The International Committee of the Red Cross'', Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521612810.</ref> 

The organization actively provides [[health care]] and medical training to populations in more than 70 countries, and frequently insists on political responsibility in conflict zones such as [[Chechnya]] and [[Kosovo]]. Only once in its history, during the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 genocide in Rwanda]], has the organisation called for a military intervention. 

MSF received the 1999 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition of its members' continuous effort to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.<ref>http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/reports/2006/top10_2005.html</ref> Dr. [[James Orbinski]], who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF.  Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 [[Seoul Peace Prize]]. <ref>http://www.seoulpeaceprize.or.kr/english/award_03.html</ref> The current president of MSF is Dr. [[Christophe Fournier]].

==Creation==
===Biafra===
[[Image:Starved girl.jpg|thumb|A child with [[kwashiorkor]] during the [[Nigerian Civil War]].]]

During the [[Nigerian Civil War]] of 1967 to 1970, the Nigerian military formed a [[blockade]] around the nation's newly [[secession|independent]] south-eastern region, [[Biafra]]. At this time, France was the only major country supportive of the Biafrans (the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] sided with the Nigerian government), and the conditions within the blockade were unknown to the world. A number of French doctors volunteered with the French Red Cross to work in [[hospital]]s and feeding centres in besieged Biafra. The Red Cross required volunteers to sign an agreement, which was seen by some as designed to maintain the organization's neutrality, whatever the circumstances. 

After entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army, and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. The doctors publicly criticized the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behavior. These doctors concluded that a new aid organization was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritize the welfare of victims.<ref name="hih">Bortolotti, Dan (2004). ''Hope in Hell: Inside the World of Doctors Without Borders'', Firefly Books. ISBN 1552978656.</ref>  However, the massive humanitarian relief effort to the Biafrans, given on the mistaken assumption that a genocide was occurring, aided the rebels and prolonged the war, resulting in thousands of excess civilian deaths.<ref>[[Alex de Waal]], ''Famine Crimes: Politics & the Disaster Relief Industry in Africa'', African Rights and the International African Institute, 1997, p. 77</ref>

===1971 establishment===

The ''Groupe d'Intervention Médicale et Chirurgicale en Urgence'' ("Emergency Medical and Surgical Intervention Group") was formed in 1970 by French doctors who had worked in Biafra, to provide aid and to emphasize the importance of victims' rights over neutrality. At the same time, [[Raymond Borel]], the editor of the French [[medical journal]] ''TONUS'', had started a group called ''Secours Médical Français'' ("French Medical Relief") in response to the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], which killed at least 500,000 in [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]). Borel had intended to recruit doctors to provide aid to victims of natural disasters. On [[20 December]] [[1971]], the two groups of colleagues merged to form ''Médecins Sans Frontières''.<ref name="hih">Bortolotti, Dan (2004). ''Hope in Hell: Inside the World of Doctors Without Borders'', Firefly Books. ISBN 1552978656.</ref>

MSF’s first mission as an independent aid organization was to the [[Nicaragua]]n capital, [[Managua]], where a [[23 December]] [[1972]] earthquake had destroyed most of the city and killed between 10,000 and 30,000 people.<ref>Bortolotti, above, puts the death toll at 10,000. An estimate of 15,000 to 30,000, warning of an inevitable dysentery epidemic, comes from: Camilo, V (1974). The Earthquake in Managua, ''The Lancet (Correspondence)'' 303 (7845): 25–26</ref> The organization, today known for its quick response in an emergency, arrived three days after the Red Cross had set up a relief mission. On [[18 September]] and [[19 September]] [[1974]],  [[Hurricane Fifi]] caused major flooding in [[Honduras]] and killed thousands of people (estimates vary), and MSF set up its first long-term medical relief mission.<ref>MSF Article [http://www.msf.fr/site/site.nsf/pages/70 Chronologies: Années 70 (French)] '''MSF-France'''. Retrieved 10 Jan. 2006.</ref>

Between 1975 and 1979, after [[South Vietnam]] had fallen to [[North Vietnam]], there was the emigration of millions of [[Cambodia]]ns to [[Thailand]] to avoid the [[Khmer Rouge]]. In response MSF set up its first [[refugee camp]] missions in Thailand.<ref name="hih">Bortolotti, Dan (2004). ''Hope in Hell: Inside the World of Doctors Without Borders'', Firefly Books. ISBN 1552978656.</ref> When Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia in 1989, MSF started long-term relief missions to help survivors of [[The Killing Fields|the mass killings]] and reconstruct the country’s health care system.<ref>MSF Article (1999) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=751B6EAC-B3D6-11D4-B1FA0060084A6370&method=full_html Cambodia's second chance] '''MSF'''.

MSF spent nine years (1976–1984) assisting surgeries in the hospitals of various cities in [[Lebanon]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], and established a reputation for its neutrality and its willingness to work under fire. Throughout the war, MSF helped both [[Lebanese Civil War#Christian militias|Christian]] and [[Lebanese Civil War#Shi.27a militias|Muslim soldiers]] alike, assisting whichever group required the most medical aid at the time. In 1984, as the situation in Lebanon deteriorated further and security for aid groups was minimized, MSF withdrew its volunteers.<ref>MSF Article [http://www.msf.fr/site/actu.nsf/actus/msfen1976 MSF in 1976: Lebanon (French)] '''MSF'''.

==New leadership==
[[Claude Malhuret]] was elected as the new president of MSF in 1977, and soon after, debates began over the future of the organization. In particular, the concept of ''témoignage'' ("witnessing"), which refers to speaking out about the suffering that one sees as opposed to remaining silent,<ref>MSF Article (2005) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=F75AB4F5-E018-0C72-093A3A517D56EB33&component=toolkit.article&method=full_html MSF's principles and identity - The challenges ahead] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 10 Jan. 2006.</ref> was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were working, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting the suffering in a country was the most effective way to solve a problem. 

In 1979, after four years of refugee movement from South Vietnam and the surrounding countries by foot and [[Boat people#Indochinese boat people|by boat]], French intellectuals made an appeal in ''[[Le Monde]]'' for "A Boat for Vietnam", a project intended to provide medical aid to the refugees. Although the project did not receive support from the majority of MSF, some nonetheless chartered a ship called ''L’Île de Lumière'' ("The Island of Light"), and, along with doctors, journalists, and photographers, sailed to the [[China Sea]] and provided some medical aid to the boat people. 

===MSF development===
In 1982, Malhuret and Rony Brauman (who would become the organisation's president in 1982), brought increased financial independence to MSF by introducing fundraising-by-mail to better collect donations. The 1980s also saw the establishment of the other operational sections from MSF-France (1971): MSF-Belgium (1980), MSF-Switzerland (1981), MSF-Holland (1984), and MSF-Spain (1986). MSF-Luxembourg was the first support section, created in 1986. The early 1990s saw the establishment of the majority of the support sections: MSF-Greece (1990), MSF-USA (1990), MSF-Canada (1991), MSF-Japan (1992), MSF-UK (1993), MSF-Italy (1993), MSF-Australia (1994), as well as Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Hong Kong (MSF-UAE was formed later).<ref name="hih">Bortolotti, Dan (2004). ''Hope in Hell: Inside the World of Doctors Without Borders'', Firefly Books. ISBN 1552978656.</ref><sup>,</sup><ref name="various">Information obtained from the various sections' websites.</ref>
Malhuret and Brauman were instrumental in professionalising MSF. In December 1979, after the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet army had invaded Afghanistan]], field missions were immediately set up to provide medical aid to the [[mujahideen]], and in February 1980, MSF publicly denounced the Khmer Rouge. During the [[1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia]], MSF set up nutrition programmes in the country in 1984, but was expelled in 1985 after denouncing the abuse of international aid and the forced resettlements. The group also set up equipment to produce clean [[drinking water]] for the population of [[San Salvador]], capital of [[El Salvador]], after the [[October 10]], [[1986]] earthquake that struck the city.<ref name="hih">Bortolotti, Dan (2004).

===Early 1990s===
The early 1990s saw MSF open a number of new national sections, and at the same time, set up field missions in some of the most dangerous and distressing situations it had ever encountered. 

In 1990, MSF first entered [[Liberia]] to help civilians and refugees affected by the [[Liberian Civil War]].<ref>MSF Article [http://www.msf.fr/site/site.nsf/pages/annees90courte Chronologie: Années 90 (French)] '''MSF-France'''.

Field missions were set up to provide relief to [[Kurd]]ish refugees who had survived the [[al-Anfal Campaign]], for which evidence of atrocities was being collected in 1991.<ref>Choo V (1993) Forensic evidence of Iraqi atrocities against Kurds, ''The Lancet'' 341 (8840): 299–300.</ref> 1991 also saw the beginning of the [[History of Somalia#Somali Civil War|Somali Civil War]], and widespread famine and disease, for which MSF set up field missions in 1992. Failed United Nations interventions led to greater violence, and MSF denounced the organisation's operation in 1993, but volunteers continued to provide health care and food. Since the United Nations left, violence in Somalia has been unhindered, and MSF is one of the few organisations helping affected civilians by running clinics and hospitals.<ref>MSF Article (2005) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=DE35A225-E018-0C72-0982B97BDC25E821&method=full_html Somalia - Saving lives in an abandoned land] '''MSF'''.

MSF first began work in [[Srebrenica]] (in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) as part of a UN convoy in 1993, one year after the [[Bosnian War]] had begun. The city had become surrounded by the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] and, containing about 60,000 [[Bosniaks]], had become an enclave guarded by a [[United Nations Protection Force]]. MSF was the only organisation providing medical care to the surrounded civilians, and as such, did not denounce the genocide for fear of being expelled from the country (it did, however, denounce the lack of access for other organisations). MSF was forced to leave the area in 1995, when the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] captured the town, deported the majority of the inhabitants, and [[Srebrenica massacre|killed approximately 8,000]].<ref>MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=751B6F1E-B3D6-11D4-B1FA0060084A6370&method=full_html Srebrenica five years on] '''MSF'''.

===Rwanda===
When the [[genocide in Rwanda]] began in April 1994, some delegates of MSF working in the country were incorporated into the ICRC medical team for protection. Both groups succeeded in keeping all main hospitals in Rwanda's capital [[Kigali]] operational throughout the main period of the genocide. MSF, together with several other aid organisations, had to leave the country in 1995, although many MSF and ICRC volunteers worked together under the ICRC's rules of engagement, which held that neutrality was of the utmost importance. These events led to a debate within the organisation about the concept of balancing neutrality of humanitarian aid workers against their witnessing role. As a result of its Rwanda mission, the position of MSF with respect to neutrality moved closer to that of the ICRC, a remarkable development in the light of the origin of the organisation.<ref>Forsythe DP (2005).

The ICRC lost 56 and MSF lost almost one hundred of their respective local staff in Rwanda, and MSF-France, which had chosen to evacuate its team from the country (the local staff were forced to stay), denounced the murders and demanded that a [[Military of France|French military]] intervention stop the genocide. MSF-France introduced the slogan ''"One cannot stop a genocide with doctors"'' to the media, and the controversial [[Opération Turquoise]] followed less than one month later.<ref name="hih">Bortolotti, Dan (2004). ''Hope in Hell: Inside the World of Doctors Without Borders'', Firefly Books.

The [[#Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines|Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines]] was created in late 1999, providing MSF with a new voice with which to bring awareness to the lack of effective treatments and [[vaccine]]s available in developing countries. In 1999 the organisation also spoke out about the lack of humanitarian support in Kosovo and Chechnya, having set up field missions to help civilians affected by the respective political situations. Although MSF had worked in the Kosovo region since 1993, the onset of the [[Kosovo War]] prompted the movement of tens of thousands of refugees, and a decline in suitable living conditions.

MSF has been active in [[Uganda]] since 1980, and provided relief to civilians during the country’s guerrilla war during the [[Uganda since 1979#The Second Obote Period: 1981-1985|Second Obote Period]]. However, the formation of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] saw the beginning of a long campaign of violence in northern Uganda and southern Sudan. Civilians were subjected to mass killings and rapes, torture, and abductions of children, who would later serve as sex slaves or [[child soldier]]s. Faced more than 1.5 million people displaced from their homes, MSF set up relief programmes in [[internally displaced person]] (IDP) camps to provide clean water, food and sanitation. Diseases such as [[tuberculosis]], measles, polio, cholera, [[ebola]], and HIV/AIDS occur in epidemics in the country, and volunteers provide vaccinations (in the cases of measles and polio) and/or treatment to the residents. Mental health is also an important aspect of medical treatment for MSF teams in Uganda, since most people refuse to leave the IDP camps for constant fear of being attacked.<ref>MSF Article (2005} [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=F7756E35-E018-0C72-098A5AC4856E0887&component=toolkit.article&method=full_html Uganda: A neglected emergency] '''MSF'''.

==Field mission structure==
Before a field mission is established in a country, an MSF team visits the area to determine the nature of the humanitarian emergency, the level of safety in the area and what type of aid is needed. Medical aid is the main objective of most missions, although some missions help in such areas as [[water purification]] and [[nutrition]].<ref>MSF-USA [http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/aboutus/what.cfm Field Operations: What Do We Do?] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 Dec. 2005.</ref>

===Field mission team===
A field mission team usually consists of a small number of coordinators to head each component of a field mission, and a "head of mission." The head of mission usually has the most experience in humanitarian situations of the members of the team, and it is his/her job to deal with the media, national governments and other humanitarian organisations.

Medical volunteers include physicians, surgeons, nurses, and various other specialists, all of whom usually have training in [[tropical medicine]] and [[epidemiology]]. In addition to operating the medical and nutrition components of the field mission, these volunteers are sometimes in charge of a group of local medical staff and provide training for them.

Although the medical volunteers almost always receive the most media attention when the world becomes aware of an MSF field mission, there are a number of non-medical volunteers who help keep the field mission functioning. Logisticians are often the most important members of a team. They are responsible for providing everything that the medical component of a mission needs, ranging from security and vehicle maintenance to food and electricity supplies. They may be [[engineer]]s and/or [[Construction foreman|foremen]], but they usually also help with setting up treatment centres and supervising local staff. Other non-medical staff are water/sanitation specialists, who are usually experienced engineers in the fields of water treatment and management and financial/administration experts who are placed with field missions.<ref>[http://www.msf.ca/overseas/index3.htm Who is needed?] '''MSF-Canada'''. Retrieved 28  Dec. 2005.</ref>

===Medical component===
Vaccination campaigns are a major part of the medical care provided during MSF missions. Diseases such as [[diphtheria]], measles, [[meningitis]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]], [[yellow fever]], polio, and cholera, all of which are uncommon in developed countries, may be prevented with [[vaccination]]. Some of these diseases, such as cholera and measles, spread rapidly in large populations living in close proximity, such as in a refugee camp, and people must be immunised by the hundreds or thousands in a short period of time.<ref>MSF Article (2003) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=2371723C-A340-45A4-919DDF2685CD9289&method=full_html The Vaccine Gap: NY Times editorial] '''MSF'''.

An equally important part of the medical care provided during MSF missions is AIDS treatment (with [[antiretroviral drug]]s), AIDS testing, and education. MSF is the only source of treatment for many countries in Africa, whose citizens make up the majority of people with HIV and AIDS world-wide.<ref name="whoaids">WHO (2004) [http://www.unaids.org/wad2004/EPIupdate2004_html_en/Epi04_03_en.htm Introduction].

Since most of the areas that require field missions have been affected by a natural disaster, civil war, or endemic disease, the residents usually require psychological support as well. Although the presence of an MSF medical team may decrease stress somewhat among victims, often a team of [[psychologists]] or [[psychiatrists]] work with victims of depression, [[domestic violence]] and [[substance abuse]]. The doctors may also train local mental health staff.<ref>MSF Article (2002) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=67AC8E1E-3EF1-4B0C-A7D473B4C8B1B2B2&method=full_html MSF mental health activities: a brief overview] '''MSF'''.

===Nutrition===
Often in situations where an MSF mission is set up, there is moderate or severe [[malnutrition]] as a result of war, drought, or government economic mismanagement. Intentional starvation is also sometimes used during a war as a weapon, and MSF, in addition to providing food, brings awareness to the situation and insists on foreign government intervention. Infectious diseases and [[diarrhoea]], both of which cause weight loss and weakening of a person's body (especially in children), must be treated with medication and proper nutrition to prevent further infections and weight loss. A combination of the above situations, as when a civil war is fought during times of drought and infectious disease outbreaks, can create famine.<ref>MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=71282930-EC70-11D4-B2010060084A6370&method=full_html Preventing malnutrition and famine] '''MSF'''.

[[Image:Msf volunteers.jpg|thumb|Volunteers in [[Niger]] working on a [[malnutrition]] project.]]

In emergency situations where there is a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, [[protein-energy malnutrition]] is most common among young children. [[Marasmus]], a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. [[Kwashiorkor]], a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect [[Human development|physical and mental development]]. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal.<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=CB803D87-94DC-423E-98E2485EAAAC0873&method=full_html Malnutrition definition and MSF treatment] '''MSF'''. Retrieved Dec. 28, 2005.</ref> In these situations, MSF sets up ''Therapeutic Feeding Centres'' for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.

A Therapeutic Feeding Centre (or Therapeutic Feeding Programme) is designed to treat severe malnutrition through the gradual introduction of a special diet intended to promote weight gain after the individual has been treated for other health problems. The treatment programme is split between two phases:<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=38EE4ACD-E76C-419D-8888955E03EF9E13&method=full_html MSF Therapeutic Feeding Programmes] '''MSF'''. Retrieved Dec. 28, 2005.</ref> 
* Phase 1 lasts for 24 hours and involves basic health care and several small meals of low energy/protein food spaced over the day.
* Phase 2 involves monitoring of the patient and several small meals of high energy/protein food spaced over each day until the individual’s weight approaches  normal.

MSF uses foods designed specifically for treatment of severe malnutrition. During phase 1, a type of therapeutic [[milk]] called [[F-75 (food)|F-75]] is fed to patients. F-75 is a relatively low energy, low fat/protein milk powder that must be mixed with water and given to patients to prepare their bodies for phase 2.<ref>Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) F-75 Description '''MSF'''.</ref> During phase 2 therapeutic milk called [[F-100 (food)|F-100]], which is higher in energy/fat/protein content than F-75, is given to patients, usually along with a peanut butter mixture called [[Plumpy'nut]]. F-100 and Plumpy'nut are designed to quickly provide large amounts of nutrients so that patients can be treated efficiently.<ref>Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) F-100 Description '''MSF'''.</ref><ref>Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) Plumpy'nut Description '''MSF'''.</ref> Other special food fed to populations in danger of starvation includes [[enriched flour]] and [[porridge]], as well as a high protein biscuit called BP5. BP5 is a popular food for treating populations because it can be distributed easily and sent home with individuals, or it can be crushed and mixed with therapeutic milk for specific treatments.<ref>Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) BP5 Description '''MSF'''.</ref>

[[Dehydration]], sometimes due to [[diarrhoea]] or cholera, may also be present in a population, and MSF set up rehydration centres to combat this. A special solution called [[Oral rehydration salt|Oral Rehydration Solution]] (ORS), which contains [[Glucose#Function|glucose]] and [[Electrolyte#Nutrition|electrolyte]]s, is given to patients to [[Rehydration|replace fluids lost]]. [[Antibiotic]]s are also sometimes given to individuals with diarrhoea if it is known that they have cholera or [[dysentery]].<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=BC1A7630-D486-4CA8-8EEB47A3E584FE93&method=full_html Diarrhoea definition and MSF treatment] '''MSF'''.

===Water and sanitation===
Clean water is essential for [[hygiene]], consumption and for feeding programmes (for mixing with powdered therapeutic milk or porridge), as well as for preventing the spread of [[water-borne disease]].<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=EAB52196-2CA6-4A93-A46CD6603BBC668D&method=full_html MSF: Water and Health] '''MSF'''. Retrieved Dec. 28, 2005.</ref> As such, MSF water engineers and volunteers must create a source of clean water. This is usually achieved by modifying an existing [[water well]], by digging a new well and/or starting a water treatment project to obtain clean water for a population. Water treatment in these situations may consist of storage sedimentation, [[water filtration|filtration]] and/or [[chlorination]] depending on available resources.<ref>MSF Article (2002) [http://web.archive.org/web/www.refugeecamp.org/learnmore/water/simple_water_treatment.htm Simple water treatment] '''MSF-UAE'''.

Sanitation is an essential part of field missions, and it may include education of local medical staff in proper [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilisation]] techniques, [[wastewater treatment]] projects, proper [[Waste management|waste disposal]], and education of the population in personal hygiene. Proper wastewater treatment and water sanitation are the best way to prevent the spread of serious water-borne diseases, such as cholera.<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=3D056CA9-5F50-401F-906979CA03089B2D&method=full_html Cholera definition and MSF treatment] '''MSF'''.

===Statistics===
In order to accurately report the conditions of a humanitarian emergency to the rest of the world and to governing bodies, data on a number of factors are collected during each field mission. The rate of malnutrition in children is used to determine the malnutrition rate in the population, and then to determine the need for feeding centres.<ref>MSF Article (2002) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=09972681-0B23-4AF6-B488A0B4A177C6CF&method=full_html Malnutrition: rates and measures] '''MSF'''. Retrieved Dec. 28, 2005.</ref> Various types of [[mortality rate]]s are used to report the seriousness of a humanitarian emergency, and a common method used to measure mortality in a population is to have staff constantly monitoring the number of burials at cemeteries.<ref>MSF Article (2002) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=C4B3E381-F16B-499D-99550AD3814DE45D&method=full_html Mortality: rates and measures] '''MSF'''. Retrieved Dec. 28, 2005.</ref> By compiling data on the frequency of diseases in hospitals, MSF can track the occurrence and location of epidemic increases (or "seasons") and stockpile vaccines and other drugs. For example, the "Meningitis Belt" (sub-Saharan Africa, which sees the most cases of meningitis in the world) has been "mapped" and the meningitis season occurs between December and June. Shifts in the location of the Belt and the timing of the season can be predicted using cumulative data over many years.<ref>WHO Fact Sheet [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/ Meningococcal meningitis] '''WHO'''. Retrieved Dec. 28, 2005.</ref> 

In addition to epidemiology surveys, MSF also uses [[Statistical survey|survey]]s of populations to determine the rates of violence in various regions. By estimating the scopes of [[massacre]]s, and determining the rate of kidnappings, rapes, and killings, psychosocial programmes can be implemented to lower the [[Epidemiology and Methodology of Suicide|suicide rate]] and increase the sense of security in a population.<ref>MSF Article [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=F8F896F8-C409-4E0E-A6ECE6F5C2034F9B&method=full_html Mental health care crucial in emergency situations] '''MSF'''.

==Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines==
{{main|Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines}}

The Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines was initiated in 1999 to increase access to [[essential medicines]] in developing countries. "Essential medicines" are those drugs that are needed in sufficient supply to treat a disease common to a population.<ref>WHO Health topic [http://www.who.int/topics/essential_medicines/en/ Essential Medicines]</ref> However, most diseases common to populations in developing countries are no longer common to populations in developed countries; therefore, [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] find that producing these drugs is no longer profitable and may raise the price per treatment, decrease development of the drug (and new treatments) or even stop production of the drug. MSF often lacks effective drugs during field missions, and started the campaign to put pressure on governments and pharmaceutical companies to increase funding for essential medicines.<ref>[http://www.accessmed-msf.org/campaign/campaign.shtm The Campaign Background] MSF Access Website.

==Dangers faced by volunteers==
Aside from injuries and death associated with stray bullets, mines and epidemic disease, MSF volunteers are sometimes attacked or kidnapped for political reasons. In some countries afflicted by civil war, humanitarian aid organisations may be viewed as helping the enemy, if an aid mission has been set up exclusively for victims on one side of the conflict, and be attacked for that reason. However, the [[War on Terrorism]] has generated attitudes among some groups in US-occupied countries that non-governmental aid organisations such as MSF are allied with or even work for the [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]]. Since the United States has labelled its operations "humanitarian actions" independent aid organisations have been forced to defend their positions, or even evacuate their teams.<ref>MSF Article (2004) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=762E8B7B-2F5F-448A-8EC26F2039794E54&method=full_html Military humanitarianism: A deadly confusion] '''MSF'''.
