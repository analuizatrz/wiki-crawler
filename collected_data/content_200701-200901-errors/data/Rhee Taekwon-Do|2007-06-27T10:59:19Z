'''Rhee Taekwon-Do''', also known as '''Rhee Tae Kwon-Do''', '''Rhee Tae Kwon Do''', or '''Rhee Taekwondo''', is a [[martial art]] [[school]] in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] teaching the [[Korean]] [[Art]] of [[Taekwon-Do]]. In Australia, the full name of the school is ''Rhee International Taekwon-Do (Australia)''; in New Zealand, it is ''Rhee International Taekwon-Do (New Zealand)''. Rhee Taekwon-Do is an independent martial art organisation, not affiliated to any larger governing body. It was affiliated to the [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]] (ITF) in the past, but has no relation to the [[World Taekwondo Federation]] (WTF).

Several founders of Australian martial art schools are ex-Rhee Taekwon-Do members, having received some or all of their foundational Taekwon-Do training in this school in the [[1970s]] or [[1980s]].

== Master Rhee ==

[[Image:070616-Janggeom-Master.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''World Master Chong Chul Rhee'''<br>Founder of Rhee Taekwon-Do]]

'''Chong Chul Rhee''' is one of the twelve original Masters of Taekwon-Do<ref name="Original Masters">[http://www.itfnz.org.nz/ref/documents/masters.htm A tribute to the original masters] Retrieved on [[13 June]] [[2007]].</ref> hand-picked from the South Korean military to develop and formalise the Art of [[Taekwon-Do]] under [[General Hong Hi Choi]] in the [[Korea Taekwon-Do Association]] (KTA), supported by the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korean Government). The KTA predated both the ITF and the WTF. Rhee was the first Master of Taekwon-Do sent to Australia by the Republic of Korea. He was an unarmed combat instructor of the Korean Marines, and spent some time in [[Southeast Asia]] (notably in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]) helping to spread the Art of Taekwon-Do there before coming to Australia.

Two of Rhee's brothers also hold the title of Master in Rhee Taekwon-Do, and assist him in managing parts of the school:
* '''Chong Hyup Rhee''' is based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and is also one of the twelve original Masters of Taekwon-Do<ref name="Original Masters">''See above.''</ref>.
* '''Chong Yoon Rhee''' is based in [[New South Wales]] and was a South Korean Army officer.
The title of Master in Rhee Taekwon-Do is also held by [http://www.martialarm.com/martial-arts-articles/Dynamic_Korean_Art.html Vernon Low], who is in charge of Rhee Taekwon-Do in [[South Australia]]. V. Low is known as Chong Chul Rhee's number one student.

"[[Master Rhee]]" is an abbreviated name held by at least five living Masters ([[Lee (Korean name)|Rhee]] is the second-most common Korean surname). Apart from the three Masters Rhee noted above, [http://www.grandmasterrhee.com/ Ki Ha Rhee] is known as the Father of British Taekwon-Do{{Fact|date=June 2007}} and [http://www.jhoonrhee.com/index.html Jhoon Goo Rhee] is known as the Father of American Taekwon-Do{{Fact|date=June 2007}} (or more specifically, United States Taekwon-Do). K. H. Rhee is also one of the twelve original Masters of Taekwon-Do<ref name="Original Masters">''See above.''</ref>.

== Disputed claims ==

[[Image:070616-Janggeom-Ladies.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ladies' training session being conducted by a senior Rhee Taekwon-Do instructor]]

Rhee Taekwon-Do's claim to be the first Taekwon-Do school in Australia— and possibly, Rhee's position as the Father of Australian Taekwon-Do— could be disputed through claims made by or concerning four other Taekwon-Do Masters:
* '''Chan Yong Kim''', 9th Dan, came to Australia in 1963 (sponsored by the [[Australian Judo Federation]]<ref name="Kim1">[http://www.thackreytkd.com/chanyongkim.shtml Biography of Grandmaster Chan-Yong Kim] Retrieved on [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref>), was the first Taekwon-Do instructor in Australia, and stayed for two years before relocating to the [[United States of America]], according to Ke Hyung No<ref name="Kim2">[http://www.nostaekwondo.com.au/taekwondo.htm No's Taekwondo] Retrieved on [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="Kim3">Stone, B. (2003): "Man of honour: Master Ke Hyung No", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 12(3):14-17.</ref>. According to Jack Rozinsky, however, Kim came to Australia in 1961 (at the invitation of the [[Silvertop Karate Club]]) and stayed in Australia for one year<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky">Ta'kody, J. (2001): "Jack Rozinsky: The art of a lifetime", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 10(1):8-11.</ref>. Rozinsky also claims to have founded the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre in 1963<ref name="Rozinsky1">Rozinsky, J. (1996): "Fighting frames", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 4(4):53.</ref>, which would make a 1963 arrival by Kim unlikely. Although Rozinsky's claims and No's claims are not consistent with each other, all of these dates would have predated the founding of Rhee Taekwon-Do.
* '''Jack Rozinsky''', 8th Dan (WTF), might himself lay claim to the title of Father of Australian Taekwon-Do based on a 1963 founding year for his school<ref name="Rozinsky1">''See above.''</ref>.
* '''Terence Walsh''', 8th Dan ([[World Kido Federation]]), claimed to have introduced the Art of Taekwon-Do to the state of New South Wales<ref name="Walsh1">Walsh, T. F. (1999): "Grandmaster Kwang Sung Hang: Taekwondo pioneer", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 8(3):48-50.</ref> in 1969<ref name="Walsh2">[http://www.walshtkd.com/ Walsh Martial Arts Australia] Retrieved on [[14 June]] [[2007]].</ref>.
* '''Young Ku Yun''', 8th Dan (ITF), has been described by ''Australasian Taekwondo'' as having introduced the Art of Taekwon-Do to [[Sydney]], New South Wales, in 1971<ref name="Yun1">Anon. (1997): "Grandmaster Yun: The changing face of martial arts", ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 6(2):9-12.</ref>. This would contradict Master Walsh's claim.
None of these four masters has claimed himself to be, nor publicly challenged Rhee's claim as, the Father of Australian Taekwon-Do. Kim would likely have been in the lower Dan ranks, and would not have held the title of Master, when he was invited to teach in Australia. Rozinsky and Walsh held 1st Dan ranking in the 1960s. In comparison, both Rhee (KTA) and Yun (ITF) would have been in the middle Dan ranks and would have been Masters when they arrived, as they were sent to Australia by their respective Korean governing bodies.

Rhee's claim as the Father of Australian Taekwon-Do could be supported by the facts that:
* Kim was in Australia for only a brief period (one or two years)<ref name="Kim3">''See above.''</ref><ref name="Kim-Rozinsky">''See above.''</ref> and he did not establish a Taekwon-Do school, but taught within another martial art school<ref name="Kim1">''See above.''</ref><ref name="Kim2">''See above.''</ref><ref name="Kim3">''See above.''</ref><ref name="Kim-Rozinsky">''See above.''</ref>.
* Rozinsky's school exists only in Victoria<ref name="Rozinsky2">[http://www.taekwondo.com.au/branches.asp Melbourne Taekwondo Centre branches] Retrieved on [[21 June]] [[2007]].</ref>.
* Walsh founded his school in 1969, which would have been after the founding of Rhee Taekwon-Do, and his school exists only in the eastern states of Australia<ref name="Walsh2">''See above.''</ref>.
* Yun arrived in Australia around five years after Master Rhee. Yun himself claimed to be the first ITF Taekwon-Do instructor in Australia<ref name="Yun2">[http://www.yunjungdo.com.au/ Yun Jung Do]. Retrieved on [[21 June]] [[2007]].</ref> rather than the first Taekwon-Do instructor in Australia.
These points will also bear on consideration of Rhee Taekwon-Do's claim to be the first Taekwon-Do school in Australia.

Rhee Taekwon-Do's claim to be the biggest Taekwon-Do school in Australia might be disputed if one considers the Australian member schools of the International Taekwon-Do Federation and the World Taekwondo Federation as unified organisations. This is a matter for debate, because Rhee Taekwon-Do is a school under the direct leadership of C. C. Rhee while the ITF and WTF consist of groups of schools under democratic leadership. (Following the death of [[General Hong Hi Choi]], there is more than one martial art organisation claiming the ITF name.) Rhee Taekwon-Do's claim to be the biggest Taekwon-Do school in Australia might be supported by independently-verifiable listings of dojang in Australia-wide advertising<ref name="Yellow Pages">''See above.''</ref><ref name="World Wide Web">''See above.''</ref>.

== Ex-Rhee members ==

The founders of several Australian martial art schools began their Taekwon-Do training in Rhee Taekwon-Do or were themselves past Rhee Taekwon-Do instructors. Ex-Rhee members are also instructors in several Australian martial art schools{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. Ex-Rhee members are listed here in approximate chronological order of their involvement in Rhee Taekwon-Do:

Rhee Taekwon-Do Dan ranking is not the same as ITF Dan ranking or WTF Dan ranking. Of all the ex-Rhee members listed, the highest-ranked would have been Rhee Taekwon-Do 3rd Dan instructors, with around 20 years' training in Rhee Taekwon-Do.

== Training ==

[[Image:070617-Janggeom-Drill.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Rhee Taekwon-Do self-defence drill to practise deflecting an incoming punch aimed at the face]]

Rhee Taekwon-Do training involves a variety of exercises. Classes typically begin (and end) with bowing as a sign of respect. Warm-up exercises prepare the body for practising Rhee Taekwon-Do's physical techniques, and are also a means for developing strength and fitness. Basic drills involving synchronised group practice are a fundamental part of Rhee Taekwon-Do training, as in many traditional martial arts. [[Hyung]] practice is another element of training that marks Rhee Taekwon-Do as a traditional martial art.

Extensive 'destruction' or breaking training using pine boards, clay tiles, and bricks are employed throughout the different ranks to develop focus, power, and correct technique. Members typically attempt breaking techniques under supervision and after considerable training.

[[Sparring]] in Rhee Taekwon-Do is different to that in [[sport]]-style taekwondo schools, such as those of the [[World Taekwondo Federation]]. Instead of a points-based system while wearing body [[armour]], the sparring is unscored, unarmoured, and non-contact as is the traditional Taekwon-Do way. Non-contact in Rhee Taekwon-Do is most often achieved by the defender actively avoiding, blocking, or otherwise neutralising an incoming attack. An alternative definition of non-contact is that while attacks are executed with full power and speed, they are stopped just short of the training partner's body.

== Ranks ==

Ranks in Rhee Taekwon-Do, as in many other martial art schools, are denoted by different kinds of belts. These give an indication of a member's stage of learning and level of responsibility within the school. [[Rank]] does not depend solely on physical or technical prowess. There are ten coloured belt grades ([[Kup rank]]) and nine black belt degrees ([[Dan rank]]). The tips are represented by a stripe of the higher colour on the right end (as seen from the wearer's point of view) of a belt of the lower colour. Dan ranks are represented by a white bar (or bars) embroidered on the black belt. A black belt without a bar is a Junior Black Belt, a degree given to members considered too young for a 1st Dan.

Rank is not necessarily comparable between different martial art schools—even if they supposedly teach the same martial art. This phenomenon is not unprecedented in [[military rank]] systems. For example, the [[Navy]] rank of [[Captain]] is considerably higher than the [[Army]] rank of Captain in many national armed forces, even though the actual title used is the same. Similarly, the rank of 1st Dan in one martial art school is not necessarily comparable to the rank of 1st Dan in another school.

== Impact ==

Rhee Taekwon-Do is the oldest Australia-wide Taekwon-Do school and is the largest such school under a single Master in charge, with at least 294 dojang in Australia<ref name="Listing">''See above.''</ref> and at least five dojang in New Zealand<ref name="Listing">''See above.''</ref>. It is the biggest Australian school still teaching Taekwon-Do as a traditional [[martial art]] rather than a [[combat sport]] or combined art/sport. Through the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]], several founders of Australian martial art schools received some or all of their foundational Taekwon-Do training in Rhee Taekwon-Do.
