One of her first television roles has also been her most notable. She played [[Donna Ludlow]] in the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]], ''[[EastEnders]]'' from 1987-1989. During her time on the show, Ziegler's scheming character contended with [[prostitution]], an attempted [[gang rape]], a [[heroin]] addiction and finally [[suicide]] (dying of a heroin overdose). The final death scenes of Ziegler's character, who had choked to death on her own [[vomit]], have been hailed as one of the most powerful anti-drug images ever screened on the programme.<ref name="first10years">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2}}</ref>
