'''John Henry Foster Babcock''' (born [[July 23]], [[1900]]) is, at age 107, the only known surviving veteran of the [[Canada|Canadian]] military to have served in [[World War I|the First World War]] since the death of [[Dwight Wilson]].<ref name="Wilson">[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2007/05/09/war-vet.html Obituary for Dwight Wilson]</ref>

==Early life==
Born into a family of thirteen children on a farm in [[Ontario, Canada]], the father died in 1906 after a tree-cutting accident.<ref name="VAC">[http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=feature/week2006/vw06_media/jbabcock_interview Veterans Affairs Canada Interview]</ref> According to his account given to [[Maclean's]], while his father was cutting down one tree, another dead tree fell on his shoulder. Though he was brought into the house on [[bobsleigh]], he only survived another two hours. According to Babcock it was an "awful blow" to the family. School was never a concern for the young Babcock, and he did not earn his [[high school]] diploma until the age of 95. <ref name="Mclean">[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0013103 Interview for Maclean's Magazine]</ref>

==World War I==

At only 15 and a half years of age, Babcock was impressed by two recruiting officers, one a [[lieutenant]] and one a [[sergeant]], who quoted from ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' at Perth Road.<ref name="Mclean"/>  Babcock was recruited in [[Sydenham, Frontenac County, Ontario|Sydenham, Ontario]] and joined the 146th Battalion of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]].<ref name="VAC"/> He was then sent to [[Valcartier]], [[Quebec]]. There he underwent a physical, where it was discovered that he was underage. He was designated status A-4: physical fit but underage. Babcock was turned down, but managed to make it all the way to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] by train before he was stopped by the company commander. <ref name="Mclean"/> 

In Halifax, he was sent to [[Wellington Barracks]], the city's peacetime barracks, where he wrestled freight onto large army vehicles. Tiring of the work, Babock took the opportunity to volunteer for the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] when fifty recruits were call on, claiming that his age was 18.<ref name="Mclean"/>  Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and they placed him in a reserve battalion known as the Boy's (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August [[1917]]. <ref name="VAC"/>

Babcock claimed a harrowing ocean voyage to [[England]], where he got [[seasick]]. The ship that he used in passage, the ''[[T.S.S. California]]'' was [[torpedo]]ed two trips later as the amount of [[submarine]] activity increased. In [[Liverpool, England|Liverpool]] he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to [[Bexhill-on-Sea]] where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of which were veterans from battles in [[France]].<ref name="Mclean"/>

The Young Soldier's Battalion trained the recruits for eight hours a day. In his spare time, Babcock went on leave to [[Scotland]], where he met his first girlfriend, a woman from the [[Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (Britain)|Women's Army Auxiliary Corps]]. He was also introduced to the pleasures of [[beer]] and the horrors of war that some of the older veterans had come across. <ref name="Mclean"/>

Babcock asserts that he would have fought in the war, given the chance,<ref name="Review">[http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=10751 Spokesman Review: Last Canadian WWI vet celebrates 107]</ref> the war ended before he could be brought to the front lines. For this reason, Babcock claims that he never felt like "a real soldier"<ref name="CBC">[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/07/18/vet-birthday.html CBC Report on Babcock's 107th birthday]</ref> and rarely talked of his experiences until his [[centenarian|centenary]].<ref name="Review"/> He also never joined any veterans associations. <ref name="VAC"/> 

===Experiences===

Babcock's brother Manley enlisted after John and served with the engineers as a [[sapper]]. He suffered a nervous breakdown after the war. This, according to Babcock, was one of innumerable psychological problems that occurred during and after the war. Babcock recalls at least one instance where a soldier shot himself with a [[.45]] after his comrades discovered that he had emigrated from [[Germany]], while another ran himself through with a [[bayonet]] after a [[pack drill]].<ref name="Mclean"/>

Babcock also recounted the importance of honesty in the [[Canadian Army]]. In one case, one of his fellow comrades stole a dollar watch and received nine months in [[prison]] and Babcock cites that as an example of the strict discipline in the military structure. <ref name="Mclean"/>

==After World War I==

With relatives in the [[United States]], Babcock paid the $7 head tax<ref name="Mclean"/> and moved there in the 1920s.<ref name="VAC"/> He became an [[United States citizen]] in 1946<ref name="Review"/> after a stint in the [[United States Army]], rising to the rank of [[Sergeant#Army 4|Sergeant]]. He still retained a Canadian Army [[pension]] that totaled $750, and he took advantage of veteran vocational training to become an [[electrician]]. He ended up running a small light plant in his home neighborhood of Sydenham. <ref name="Mclean"/> Among his various stations was a post at [[Fort Lewis]] near [[Tacoma, Washington]]. <ref name="Review"/> 

Babcock also became a pilot at the age of 65 and is in good mental and physical health, exemplified by his ability to quickly recite the [[alphabet]] backwards, spell out his name in [[Morse Code]] and take daily walks with his wife to keep in good shape. At the age of 100, he wrote an autobiography, which was distributed to family and friends. <ref name="VAC"/> It was titled ''Ten Decades of John Foster Babcock''.<ref name="Review"/> 

Babcock has been married twice, first to Elise, then to Dorothy, whom he met when she was taking care of his first wife while she was dying.<ref name="VAC"/> Babcock has one son, one daughter, eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. One grandchild, Matt, was an army [[dentist]] in [[Iraq]] during the [[Iraq War]].<ref name="Mclean"/> John and Dorothy live in [[Spokane, Washington]]. <ref name="KXLY">[http://www.kxly.com/news/?sect_rank=1&section_id=559&story_id=12946 John Babcock, last surviving Canadian WWI vet, celebrates 107th birthday]</ref>

===Last surviving Canadian veteran===

Since the death of Dwight Wilson on [[May 9]], [[2007]], John Babcock is the last known Canadian veteran of the First World War. Babcock is proud of his status as the last surviving World War I veteran, although he does not feel the need to be honoured in a specific [[state funeral#Canada|state funeral]]. Instead, he is of the opinion that "they should commemorate all of them, instead of just one." <ref name="Mclean"/> He was also quoted as saying "I'm sure that all the attention I'm getting isn't because of anything spectacular I've done. It's because I'm the last one."<ref name="Review"/> 

Nevertheless, Babcock received much attention on the occasion of his 107th birthday. Birthday wishes came in from [[Queen Elizabeth II]] (whom Babcock jokes is a "nice looking gal"), [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]], [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] and [[Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[Peter MacKay]]. Minister of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] from [[British Columbia]] [[James Moore (Canadian politician)|James Moore]] visited Babcock personally to deliver the gifts and greetings. For his birthday, Babcock and his wife went to [[Rosauers]] for his favourite meal of [[hamburger]]s and [[french fries|fries]].<ref name="KXLY"/>  

Among the gifts he received was a [[necktie]] adorned with a [[poppy]] pattern, a symbol of World War I.<ref name="Review"/> Babcock credits his [[longevity]] to the intense physical training that he received in both the U.S. and Canadian armies. <ref name="VAC"/>
