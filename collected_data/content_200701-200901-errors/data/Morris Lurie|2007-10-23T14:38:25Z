'''Morris Lurie''' (born [[30 October]] [[1938]]) is an [[Australia]]n writer of comic novels, short stories, essays, plays, and children's books. His work focuses on the comic mishaps of Jewish-Australian men (often writers) of Lurie's generation, who are invariably jazz fans.

Lurie was born in [[Melbourne, Australia]], to Arie and Esther Lurie. His first novel was the comic ''Rappaport'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1966) and focused with a day in the life of a young Melbourne antique dealer and his immature friend Friedlander. The characters, transplanted to London, were further chronicled in ''Rappaport's Revenge'' (1973). Lurie's self-exile from Australia to Europe, the UK and Northern Africa provides much of the material for his fiction. His second novel was ''The London Jungle Adventures of Charlie Hope'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1968). ''Flying Home'' (1978) was named by the National Book Council as one of the ten best Australian books of the decade. Subsequent novels are ''Seven Books for Grossman'' (1983), really a novella parodying of the styles of various authors; and ''Madness'' (1991), about a writer dealing with a mentally unstable girlfriend.

Lurie is best known for his short stories. He recently wrote an instructional guide ''When and How to Write Short Stories and What They Are'' (2000). He has been published in many prestigious magazines including ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Virginia Quarterly]]'', ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', ''The [[Telegraph Magazine]]'', ''[[Transatlantic Review]]'', ''[[Island (literary journal)|Island]]'', ''[[Meanjin]]'', ''[[Overland (literary journal)|Overland]]'', ''[[Quadrant (literary journal)|Quadrant]]'' and ''[[Westerly (literary journal)|Westerly]]''.

A co-worker and friend of [[Peter Carey]], he wrote an early critical review of Carey's first book in''[[Nation Review]]'', [[November 29]], [[1974]]. In November 2006 he was given the [[Patrick White Award]] for, under-recognised, lifetime achievement in literature.[http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/in-the-right-place-at-the-white-time/2006/11/10/1162661899433.html]
