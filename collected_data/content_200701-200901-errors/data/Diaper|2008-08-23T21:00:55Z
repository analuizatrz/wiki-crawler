A '''diaper''' (in [[North America]]) or '''nappy''' (in the [[United Kingdom]], many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] and [[Ireland]]) is an absorbent [[garment]] worn by individuals who are incapable of controlling their [[Urinary bladder| bladder]] or [[bowel]] movements, or are unable or unwilling to use a [[toilet]]. When diapers become full and can no longer hold any more waste, they require changing; this process is often performed by a secondary person such as a parent or caregiver.  Failure to change a diaper on a regular enough basis can result in [[diaper rash]].

Diapers have been worn throughout human history, and made of [[cloth]] or [[disposable]] materials.  Whereas cloth diapers are comprised of layers of fabric such as terry towelling and can be washed and reused multiple times, disposable diapers contain absorbent chemicals and are thrown away after use.  The decision to use cloth or disposable diapers is a controversial one, owing to issues ranging from convenience, health, cost, and their effect on the environment.  Currently, disposable diapers are the most commonly used, with [[Pampers]] and [[Huggies]] being the most well-known brands in the industry. [[Plastic pants]] can be worn over diapers to avoid leaks.
 
Diapers are primarily worn by [[children]] who are not yet [[toilet training|potty trained]] or suffer from [[bedwetting]].  However, they can also be used by adults who suffer from [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]] or in certain circumstances where access to a toilet is unavailable.  These can include the elderly, those with a physical or [[Mental illness|mental]] [[disability]], and people working in extreme conditions such as [[astronaut]]s.  Diapers are usually worn out of necessity rather than choice, although there are exceptions; people such as [[paraphilic infantilism|infantilists]] and [[diaper fetishism|diaper fetishists]] wear diapers recreationally for comfort, emotional fulfillment, or sexual gratification.  Terms such as "incontinence pants" and "incontinence pads" are often used to refer to adult diapers.

==History==
===Etymology===
{{Quote_box|width=30%|align=right|quote="''Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper''"|source=—One of the earliest known uses of the word in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.<ref name=Shakespeare>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h4CQllpmB_gC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=another+bear+the+ewer+the+third+a+diaper&source=web&ots=WX0bPTt3Lq&sig=LoOuzninBjIMTtSy-SSQa_9fA8Y&hl=en ''The Taming of the Shrew'']</ref>}}
The word ''diaper'' originally referred to the type of cloth rather than its use ; "diaper" was the term for a pattern of small repeated geometric shapes, and later came to describe a white cotton or linen fabric with this pattern<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063239?query_type=word&queryword=diaper&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=7XBH-TjGw7R-11027&hilite=50063239 Oxford English Dictionary - "Diaper"]</ref>. The first cloth diapers consisted of a special type of soft tissue sheet, cut into geometric shapes. This type of pattern was called [[diapering]] and eventually gave its name to the cloth used to make diapers and then to the diaper itself.  This usage stuck in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] the word "nappy" took its place.  Most sources believe ''nappy'' is a diminutive form of the word [[napkin]]<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00321105?query_type=word&queryword=nappy&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&search_id=7XBH-OkOsBx-11004&result_place=1 Oxford English Dictionary - "Nappy"]</ref>.

===Development===
[[Image:Unangenehme Vaterpflichten.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Unangenehme Vaterpflichten by [[Adriaen Brouwer]], depicting the changing of a diaper.]]
The problem of clothing infants not yet potty trained is as old as human history.  In some countries with warmer climates, babies were kept naked and mothers tried to anticipate their bowel movements so as to avoid mess near their living areas.  This method is known as [[elimination communication]] and is still used today in some cultures.<ref name=Elimination>[http://www.naturalbirthandbabycare.com/elimination-communication.html What is Elimination Communication?]</ref>  

In the 19th century, the modern diaper began to take shape and children in Europe and North America were being diapered using [[cotton]] material, held in place with a [[safety pin]].  Cloth diapers were first mass produced in 1887 by Maria Allen in the United States.

In the 20th century, the disposable diaper gradually evolved through the inventions of several different people.  In 1942, a Swedish paper company known as Pauliström created the first disposable diaper using sheets of tissue placed inside [[rubber pants]].  Four years later, a Westport housewife named Marion Donovan developed a waterproof diaper cover known as the "Boater" using a sheet of plastic from a shower curtain; she was granted four [[patents]] for her invention, including the use of plastic snaps as opposed to safety pins<ref>{{cite web|title=Marion Donovan: Inventor of Disposable Diapers|url=http://www.women-inventors.com/Marion-Donovan.asp|accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref>.  In 1947, a man named George M. Schroder invented the first ever diaper with disposable nonwoven fabric.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time and Events in Conservation History|publisher=Texas Legacy Project|url=http://www.texaslegacy.org/m/timeline.html|accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref>  Disposable diapers were introduced to the US in 1949 by [[Johnson & Johnson]].  During the 1950s, companies such as Kendall, [[Parke-Davis]], [[Playtex]], and Molnlycke entered the disposable diaper market. In 1956, [[Procter & Gamble]] began researching disposable diapers.  [[Vic Mills]], along with his project group including William Dehaas, both men who worked for the company, invented "Pampers" while searching for a better product to use. Presented to Fred Wells as project p-57 (this was the plane Wells had taught American pilots to fly during WWII), Mills stated "This one will fly."  Although Pampers were conceptualized in 1959, the diapers themselves were not launched into the market until 1961<ref>{{cite web|title=The Politics of Diapers|url=http://www.mothering.com/articles/new_baby/diapers/politics.html|accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref>.  Over the next few decades, the disposable diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter & Gamble's Pampers and [[Kimberly Clark]]'s Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design.  Several improvements were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the "hourglass shape" so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the invention of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate.

==Types==
===Disposable===
Since their introduction several decades ago, product innovations include the use of [[superabsorbent polymer]]s, resealable tapes, and [[elastic]]ised waist bands. They are now much thinner and much more absorbent. The product range has more recently been extended into children's toilet training phase with the introduction of training pants and pant diapers.   

Modern disposable baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction<ref>{{cite web|title=How disposable diaper is made|publisher=How Products Are Made|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Disposable-Diaper.html|accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref>, which allows the transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable [[polyethylene]] film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of cellulose pulp and superabsorbent polymers for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of nonwoven material with a distribution layer directly beneath which transfers wetness to the absorbent layer.

Other common features of disposable diapers include one or more pairs of either adhesive or [[velcro]] tapes to keep the diaper securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication following confirmation of an as yet unsoiled diaper. Elasticized fabric around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool which has not been absorbed. Some diapers lines now commonly include wetness indicators, in which a chemical included in the fabric of the diaper changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that the diaper is wet.

A disposable diaper may also include an inner fabric designed to hold moisture against the skin for a brief period before absorption to alert a toilet training or bedwetting user that they have urinated. 

Some disposable diapers include fragrances, lotions or [[essential oils]] in order to help mask the scent of a soiled diaper or to protect the skin. Care of disposable diapers is minimal, and primarily consists of keeping them in a dry place before use, with proper disposal in a garbage receptacle upon soiling. Stool is supposed to be deposited in the toilet, but is generally put in the garbage with the rest of the diaper. Cleaning is not required.

===Cloth===
[[Image:Cloth diaper.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Baby cloth diaper filled with extra cloth.]]
Cloth diapers are reusable and can be made from natural fibers, manmade materials, or a combination of both. They are often made from industrial [[cotton]] which may be [[bleach]]ed white or left the fiber’s natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include [[wool]], [[bamboo]], and unbleached [[hemp]]. Manmade materials such as an internal absorbent layer of [[microfiber]] toweling or an external waterproof layer of [[polyurethane laminate]] (PUL) may be used. [[Polyester]] fleece and faux suedecloth are often used inside cloth diapers as a "stay-dry" [[wicking]] liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers.

Traditionally, cloth diapers consisted of a folded square or rectangle of cloth, fastened with [[safety pin]]s.  Modern cloth diapers come in a host of shapes, including preformed cloth diapers, all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors, and pocket or "stuffable" diapers, which consist of a water-resistant outer shell sewn with an opening for insertion of absorbent material inserts<ref>{{cite web|title=Cloth Diapering|url=http://www.naturalfamilyonline.com/5-diap/48-cloth-diapers-simple.htm|accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref>. Closure methods include snap closures and hook and loop fasteners (such as [[Velcro]]).

Cloth diapers require dry storage as well, and equipment and supplies for cleaning. Cloth diapers place less stress on landfills as compared to single-use disposable diapers, but also require washing in water with [[detergent]] to be properly cleaned. The method of "dry-pailing" after removal of solid waste and washing on a cold or warm wash removes most bacteria. Sun exposure will kill any remainder and usually resolves any staining issues. As an alternative to at-home cleaning, some locations have a fee-based cloth diapering service that delivers clean diapers and picks up soiled ones, while parents in more rural areas often find that they must clean diapers using their own cleaning facilities.

Some brands seek to combine cloth and disposable diapers.  Generally, these hybrids are cloth diapers with a disposable inner layer.

===Debate===
Cloth diaper-wearing children go through about 6,000 diaper changes. If thrown into a landfill, cotton diapers decompose within six months.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} Since disposable diapers are discarded after a single use, usage of disposable diapers increased the burden on landfill sites, and increased environmental awareness has led to a growth in campaigns for parents to use reusable alternatives such as cloth or hybrid diapers. An estimated 27.4 billion disposable diapers are used each year in the US, resulting in a possible 3.4 million tons of used diapers adding to landfills each year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Diapers Go Green|publisher=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1702357,00.html|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref>

The environmental impact of cloth as compared to disposable diapers has been studied several times. In one cradle-to-grave study sponsored by the [[National Association of Diaper Services]] (NADS) and conducted by [[Carl Lehrburger]] and colleagues, results found that disposable diapers produce seven times more solid waste when discarded and three times more waste in the manufacturing process.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} In addition, effluents from the plastic, pulp, and paper industries are far more hazardous than those from the cotton-growing and -manufacturing processes. Single-use diapers consume less water than reusables laundered at home, but more than those sent to a commercial diaper service. According to industry data from [[Franklin Associates]] and the [[American Petroleum Institute]], 3.5 billion gallons of oil are used to produce the 18 million throwaway diapers that end up in landfills each year. Washing cloth diapers at home uses 50 to 70 gallons of water every three days, which is roughly equivalent to flushing the toilet five times a day, unless the user has a high-efficiency washing machine. An average diaper service puts its diapers through an average of 13 water changes, but uses less water and energy per diaper than one laundry load at home.<ref>Carl Lehrburger, Jocelyn Mullen, and C. V. Jones, "Diapers: Environmental Impacts and Lifecycle Analysis," January 1991</ref>

Other studies have indicated that reusable diapers are more damaging to the environment <ref> [[Arthur D. Little]], Inc., "Disposable Versus Reusable Diapers: Health, Environmental and Economic Comparisons." 1990</ref>. An independent study by the UK government backed organisation the [[Environment Agency]], found there to be no clear advantage in environmental impact for reusables. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4559665.stm No green winner in nappy debate] BBC News, Thursday, 19 May, 2005. Accessed April 2008.</ref>  The United Kingdom based [[Women's Environmental Network]]{{Fact|date=April 2008}} has claimed that all such studies promoted there were directly funded or commissioned by disposable diaper companies. In one instance in July 1991, such companies withdrew their claims amid pressure from the press upon the release of analysis done by The Landbank Consultancy, an independent environmental agency. The [[Landbank Report]] of January 1991{{Fact|date=April 2008}} concluded that, compared to cloth diapers, throwaway diapers use 20 times more raw materials, three times more energy, twice as much water, and generate 60 times more waste.

There are variations in the care of cloth diapers that can account for different measures of environmental impact.  For example, using a cloth diaper laundering service involves additional pollution from the vehicle that picks up and drops off deliveries.  Some people who launder cloth diapers at home wash each load twice, considering the first wash a "prewash", and thus doubling the energy and water usage from laundering.  Cloth diapers are most commonly made of cotton, which is generally considered an environmentally wasteful crop to grow. "Conventional cotton is one of the most chemically-dependent crops, sucking up 10% of all agricultural chemicals and 25% of insecticides on 3% of our arable land; that's more than any other crop per unit."<ref>[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/08/green-basics-organic-cotton.php Green Basics: Organic Cotton], treehugger.com</ref>  This effect can be mitigated by using other materials, such as bamboo and hemp.

==Usage==
===Children===
Diapers are commonly worn from birth until a person is toilet trained.  Replacing a soiled diaper with a fresh one is essential to the prevention of contracting skin irritation of the buttocks, genitalia, and/or the waist.  Babies may need to have their diapers changed ten or more times a day.<ref>[http://www.kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_newborn/basics/diapering.html Diapering Your Baby<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Diapering can also serve as a bonding experience for parent and child.<ref>[http://www.keepkidshealthy.com/parenting_tips/ep/diaper_changes.html Diaper Changes - Gentle Child Care<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  To avoid skin irritation, commonly referred to as [[diaper rash]], the diaper of those prone to it should be changed as soon as possible after it is soiled (especially by fecal matter), as feces contain [[urease]] which catalyzes the conversion of the urea in urine to [[ammonia]] which irritates the skin and can cause painful redness.<ref>[http://www.uspharmacist.com/oldformat.asp?url=newlook/files/cons/acf2ee8.htm Diaper Rash: The Bottom Line<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The age at which toilet training should begin is a subject of debate and keeping children in diapers beyond infancy can be controversial, with family psychologist [[John Rosemond]] claiming it is a "slap to the intelligence of a human being that one would allow baby to continue soiling and wetting himself past age two."<ref name=Delayed>[http://www.dy-dee.com/Benefits_of_Cloth/Skin_Care/Toilet_Training_Brazelton/toilet_training_brazelton.html Delayed Toilet Training Issues]</ref> Pediatrician [[T. Berry Brazelton]], however, believes that toilet training is the child's choice and has encouraged this view in various commercials for Pampers Size 6, a diaper for older children.<ref name=Delayed/>  Brazelton warns that enforced toilet training can cause serious longterm problems, and that it is the child's decision when to stop wearing diapers, not the parents'.<ref name=Delayed/><ref name=Pampers6>{{cite news|url=http://www.cincypost.com/business/1998/pg072298.html|title=P&G announces Pampers now a bigger disposable|author=Patrick Larkin|first=Patrick|last=Larkin|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|publisher=[[E.

Children may have problems with daytime or more often nocturnal bladder control until eight years or older and need to wear diapers at nighttime to control [[bedwetting]].<ref>[http://www.bedwettingweb.com/bed-wetting/bed-wetting/the-bed-wetting-diaper.html The Bed Wetting Diaper]</ref>  While awake, most children no longer need diapers when past two to four years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality.<ref>Honig, A: "[http://www.scholastic.com/earlylearner/experts/behavior/0_2_toiletstubborn.htm Toilet Training Stubbornness]," Scholastic Parent and Child</ref>  However, it is becoming increasingly common for children as old as seven to still be wearing diapers because their parents neglect or child's opposition to toilet train.  This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from dirty diapers.  Teachers' groups—who are attributing the epidemic to an increase in full-time day care use—are requesting that diapered children be banned from the classroom.  The disposable diaper industry has been accused of encouraging this trend by manufacturing diapers in increasingly larger sizes.  "[S]uper-comfortable nappies" have also been criticized; the advanced technology in modern diapers wick wetness away from skin, leaving the child oblivious to their accident and when they need to go to the toilet.  Paediatric nurse June Rogers claims that the attitude of parents plays a major role in the problem, and that toilet training is simply not a priority for many of them.<ref name=NappySchool>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23969932-952,00.html|title=Kids at school in nappies|author=Hannah Davies|date=2008-06-05|publisher=[[The Courier-Mail]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref name=NappySchool2>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23970216-421,00.html|title=Parents sending kids to school in nappies|author=Hannah Davies|date=2008-06-05|publisher=[[The Courier-Mail]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref name=Absolutelypotty>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1026958/Absolutely-potty-How-children-wearing-nappies-SCHOOL--dire-risks-health.html|title=Absolutely potty!

Because of the increase in older children wearing diapers, companies have designed special "training pants" which bridge the gap between baby diapers and normal underwear during the toilet training process.  These training pants are distinct from diapers in that they mimic underwear and do not require complex fastening, so children can be changed standing up or even independently without adult assistance.  Studies have shown that the use of training pants instead of diapers can be effective in speeding up toilet training.<ref name=Pull-UpsFAQs>[http://www.pull-ups.com/na/utility/faqs.asp Pull-Ups Training Pants FAQs]</ref>  Larger versions, such as [[GoodNites]], are available for older children and teenagers who have already been toilet trained but continue to suffer from bedwetting.  They are intended to be discreet and similar to underwear, so as to avoid alienating those who find wearing diapers at a late age to be embarrassing.<ref name=GettingStarted>[http://www.goodnites.com/na/productinfo/productinfo_gettingstarted.asp GoodNites - Getting Started]</ref>  Available in both cloth and disposable versions, they are constructed like a diaper with an absorbent core and a waterproof shell and can be worn at any age until the child stops wetting the bed.  Because they can be pulled on and off like underpants, children are able to use the toilet if they feel the need, rather than being forced to wet or soil themselves unnecessarily.  Whereas most diapers are [[unisex]], training pants often come in sex-specific versions because children become more aware of [[gender role]]s as they grow older.<ref name=Pull-UpsFAQs/>

With the development of training pants making it possible for children to change their own diapers, and pediatricians such as Brazelton claiming that forced toilet training can cause lasting psychological and health problems, children are wearing diapers at a much older age than they did historically.<ref name=Delayed/>  The Children's Health and Wellness website claims that diapering a child can prolong bedwetting, as it sends a "message of permission" to urinate in their sleep.<ref>[http://www.drpaul.com/library/BEDWETDIAPERS.html Bedwetting and diapers]</ref>  Dr Anthony Page of the Creative Child Online Magazine claims that children can get used to their diapers and begin to view them as a comfort, and that of the children surveyed, most would rather wear diapers than worry about getting up at night to go to the toilet.<ref>[http://www.creativechildonline.com/friends/bed_wetting.html The Bed-Wetting Report - Do diapers prolong bedwetting?]</ref> In a series of online surveys, Robert A Pretlow, MD, of eHealth International, Inc., cites an identical figure. He argues that if Internet users are representative of society as a whole, these surveys imply that a fetishistic or emotional attraction to diapers may be responsible for these "comfort" cases, and that "these behaviors are a significant cause of enuresis and incontinence." He called for further studies to be done on the topic.<ref name=Mednet2002>{{cite web|last=Pretlow|first=Robert A|title=THE INTERNET CAN REVEAL PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN CAUSES OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS, SUCH AS ATTRACTION TO DIAPERS AS A CAUSE OF ENURESIS AND INCONTINENCE|publisher=Mednet 2002|url=http://www.mednet2002.org/abstracts/display.cfm?}}</ref>

Parents and other carers for children often carry spare diapers and necessities for diaper changing in a [[diaper bag]].

===Adults===<!-- This section is linked from [[Adult diaper]] -->
[[Image:Windelfetischist.jpg|thumb|right|Adult male wearing a diaper.]]
Although most commonly worn by and associated with babies and children, diapers are also worn by adults for a variety of reasons. In the medical community, they are usually referred to as "adult absorbent briefs" rather than diapers, which are associated with children and may have a negative connotation. People with medical conditions which cause them to suffer from [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] or [[fecal incontinence]] may wear diapers or similar products because they are unable to control their bladders or bowels. People who are bedridden or in a wheelchair may also wear diapers because they are unable to access the toilet independently. The usage of adult diapers can be a source of embarrassment,<ref name=WYGGYGG>{{cite web|last=Stack|first=Jennie Borodko|title=When You've Gotta Go, You've Gotta Go|publisher=[[Muscular Dystrophy Association]]|date=2001-02|url=http://www.mda.org/publications/Quest/q81gottago.html|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> and products are often marketed under euphemisms such as incontinence pads.

In 2006, seventeen students taking a geriatrics [[pharmacotherapy]] course participated in a voluntary "diaper experience" exercise to help them understand the impact incontinence has on older adults.  The students, who wore adult diapers for a day before writing a paper about it, described the experience as unfamiliar and physically challenging, noting that being in diapers had a largely negative impact on them and that better solutions to incontinence are required.  However, they praised the exercise for giving them insight into incontinence and the effect it has on peoples' lives.<ref name=DiaperExperience>{{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p115730_index.html|title=Active Learning in a Geriatrics Pharmacotherapy Course: Outcomes Associated with a Diaper Experience Exercise|author=Boyce, Eric. and Dolder, Christian|date=2006-10-05|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina, San Diego, California|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>  Similarly, in 2008, [[Ontario]]'s [[Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (Ontario)|Minister of Health]] [[George Smitherman]] revealed that he was considering wearing adult diapers himself to test their absorbency following complaints that nursing home residents were forced to remain in unchanged diapers for days at a time.

[[Sexual fetishism|Fetishists]] can wear diapers for sexual gratification.

There are those who believe diapers are a preferable alternative to using the bathroom.  According to Dr Dipak Chatterjee of [[Mumbai]] newspaper ''[[DNA (newspaper)|Daily News and Analysis]]'', public toilet facilities are so unhygienic that it is actually safer for people—especially women—who are vulnerable to infections to wear adult diapers instead.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dr. Dipak|last=Chatterjee|title=Docs advise diapers over public loos|date=2007-02-11|publisher=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1079314|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>  Seann Odoms of [[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]] magazine believes that wearing diapers can help people of all ages to maintain healthy bowel function. He himself claims to wear diapers full-time for this purported health benefit. "Diapers," he states, "are nothing other than a more practical and healthy form of underwear. They are the safe and healthy way of living."<ref name=SeannOdoms>[http://menshealth.about.com/cs/fromyou/a/wear_nappies.htm Nappies seriously manage your health - Seann Odoms]</ref>  Author [[Paul Davidson]] argues that it should be socially acceptable for everyone to wear diapers permanently, claiming that they provide freedom and remove the unnecessary hassle of going to the bathroom, just as social advancement has offered solutions to other complications.  He writes, "Make the elderly finally feel embraced instead of ridiculed and remove the teasing from the adolescent equation that affects so many children in a negative way. Give every person in this world the opportunity to live, learn, grow and urinate anywhere and anytime without societal pressure to "hold themselves in.""<ref>[http://www.pauldavidson.net/2006/10/22/adult-diapers-for-the-rest-of-us/ Adult Diapers for the rest of us]</ref>

===Animals===
Diapers and diaperlike products are sometimes used on pets, laboratory animals, or working animals. This is often due to the animal not being [[housebroken]], or for older, sick, or injured pets who have become incontinent. In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaperlike waste collection devices.

In 2002, the [[Vienna]] city council proposed that horses be made to wear diapers to prevent them from defecating in the street.  This caused controversy amongst animal rights groups, who claimed that wearing diapers would be uncomfortable for the animals.  The campaigners protested by lining the streets wearing diapers themselves, which spelled out the message "Stop pooh bags".<ref name=Horses1>{{cite web|title=Row as horses told to wear nappies|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sport/newsid_2271000/2271844.stm|date=2002-09-20|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>  In the [[Kenya]]n town of [[Limuru]], donkeys were also diapered at the council's behest.<ref name=Donkey>{{cite web|title=Anger at Kenya donkey nappy plan|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6902309.stm|date=2007-07-17|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>  A similar scheme in [[Blackpool]] ordered that horses be fitted with rubber and plastic diapers to stop them littering the promenade with dung.  The council consulted the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] to ensure that the diapers were not harmful to the horses' welfare.<ref name=Horses2>{{cite web|title=Blackpool horses to get nappies|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/6058888.stm|date=2006-10-17|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref><ref name=Horses3>{{cite web|title=Nappy plan for Blackpool horses|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/7092855.stm|date=2007-11-13|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> <ref name=Horses4>{{cite web|title=Horse nappy plan given go-ahead|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/7107957.stm|date=2007-11-22|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>

Other animals that are sometimes diapered include female cats and dogs when [[ovulation|ovulating]] and thus bleeding, and monkeys and apes; most are physically unable to control their excretions, which is not a convenient situation for tree-dwelling animals. Diapers are often seen on trained animals who appear on TV shows, in movies, or for live entertainment or educational appearances.
