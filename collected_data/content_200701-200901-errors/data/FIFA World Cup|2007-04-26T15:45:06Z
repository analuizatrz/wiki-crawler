The '''FIFA World Cup''', sometimes called the '''Football World Cup''' or the '''Soccer World Cup''', but usually referred to simply as the '''World Cup''', is an international [[football (soccer)|football]] competition contested by the [[list of men's national football (soccer) teams|men's national football teams]] of the member nations of ''Fédération Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]], except in 1942 and 1946, due to [[World War II]]. 

The tournament's final phase, often called the ''World Cup Finals'', is the most widely-viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 1.1 billion people watching the [[2002 FIFA World Cup#Final|2002 tournament final]].<ref name="2002coverage">[http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html 2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage], FIFA official website. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> The current format of the Finals involves thirty-two national teams competing at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. To determine the participating teams, [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying rounds]] take place over the three years preceding the Finals.

In the eighteen tournaments held, only seven nations have won the title. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] is the most successful World Cup team, having won the tournament five times. The current Cup holders, [[Italy national football team|Italy]], follow with four titles, while [[Germany national football team|Germany]] hold three. The other former champions are [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] (who won the inaugural tournament) and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] with two titles each, and [[England national football team|England]] and [[France national football team|France]] with one title each.

The [[2006 FIFA World Cup|most recent World Cup Finals]] were held between [[June 9]] and [[July 9]], 2006 in [[Germany]], where [[Italy national football team|Italy]] were crowned champions after beating [[France national football team|France]] in the final, winning the [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] 5-3 after the match finished 1-1 after [[extra time]]. The [[2010 FIFA World Cup|next World Cup Finals]] will be held in 2010 in [[South Africa]].

Since 1991, FIFA has also organized the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] every four years.

==History==
{{main|History of the FIFA World Cup}}

===Previous international competitions=== 
The first international football match was played in [[1872 in sports|1872]] between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]]. <ref>[http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html England National Football Team Match No. 1]</ref>  At this stage the sport was rarely played outside [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. As football began to increase in popularity in other parts of the world at the turn of the century, it was held as a [[demonstration sport]] (with no medals awarded) at the [[Football at the 1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] and [[Football at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Summer Olympics]], and at the [[Football at the 1906 Summer Olympics|1906 Intercalated Games]]; football became an official competition at the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympics]]. Planned by [[The Football Association]] (FA), the event was for [[amateurism|amateur]] players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the [[England national amateur football team]]) won the event in both 1908 and [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912]].

After [[FIFA]] was founded in 1904, there was an attempt made by FIFA to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside of the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.<ref name="FIFAhistory">[http://www.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,1283,4,00.html Where it all began] FIFA official website. Retrieved on [[April 10]] [[2006]].</ref>

Some may argue that the [[FA Cup]] was the first ''World Cup'', as  [[Scotland|Scottish]] side [[Queen's Park F.C.]] played in 1884 and 1885 (reaching the final on both occasions) and numerous [[Football in Wales|Welsh]] sides ([[Cardiff City]] won in 1927) having competed in England's national cup, however this can be dismissed as all teams who have participated have been located in the [[United Kingdom]].
With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, [[Thomas Lipton|Sir Thomas Lipton]] organized the [[Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]] tournament in [[Turin]] in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as ''The First World Cup'',<ref>[http://www.shrewsbury.gov.uk/Public/news/thomaslipton.htm 'The First World Cup'. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]. Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council. Retrieved on [[April 11]][[2006]].</ref> and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]], but [[The Football Association]] of [[England]] refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited [[West Auckland Town F.C.|West Auckland]], an amateur side from [[County Durham]], to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title, and were given the trophy to keep forever, as per the rules of the competition. 

In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]] as a "world football championship for amateurs",<ref name="FIFAhistory" /> and took responsibility for managing the event. This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the [[Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Summer Olympics]], contested by [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] (who were [[Knockout tournament|knocked out]] in their first match) and thirteen European teams. The [[gold medal]]s were won by [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/ol1920f-det.html VII. Olympiad Antwerp 1920 Football Tournament] [[rec.sport.soccer Statistics Foundation]]. Retrieved on [[June 10]] [[2006]].</ref> [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] then won the Olympic football tournaments in [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]. In 1928 FIFA made the decision to stage their own international tournament outside of the Olympics. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions (as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era) and to celebrate their [[centenary]] of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country.

===First World Cup===

The [[1932 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], did not plan to include football as part of the schedule due to the low popularity of [[Soccer in the United States|football in the United States]], as [[American football]] had been growing in popularity. FIFA and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] also disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the Games.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A565148 The Football World Cup - An Introduction], [[h2g2]]. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> [[List of Presidents of FIFA|FIFA president]] [[Jules Rimet]] thus planned the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural World Cup tournament]] to be held in [[Uruguay]] in 1930. The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1930.html Uruguay 1930] FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[January 9]] [[2006]].</ref> Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total 13 nations took part — seven from [[South America]], four from [[Europe]] and two from [[North America]]. 

The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by [[France national football team|France]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], who beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 4-1 and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 3-0, respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by [[Lucien Laurent]] of France. In the final, [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] defeated [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 4-2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people in [[Montevideo]], and became the first nation to win a World Cup.<ref name="origin">{{PDFlink|[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/releases/en/fwc_origin_en.pdf FIFA World Cup Origin]|53.6&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/octet-stream, 54916 bytes -->}}, FIFA [[News release|Media Release]]. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Growth===
The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] tournaments, with Brazil the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions were cancelled due to [[World War II]] and its aftermath.

The [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] was the first to include British participants. British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against a foreign influence on football,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0001/index.shtml Scotland and the 1950 World Cup], BBC. Retrieved on [[May 13]] [[2006]].</ref> but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation. The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again.

In the tournaments between 1934 and [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], 16 teams competed for each finals tournament, except in 1938 and 1950 when teams withdrew after qualifying, leaving them with 15 and 13 teams respectively. Most of the participating nations were from [[Europe]] and [[South America]], with a small minority from [[North America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], semi-finalists in 1930; [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]], quarter-finalists in 1938; [[Korea DPR national football team|North Korea]], quarter-finalists in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]; and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], quarter-finalists in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]].

The finals were expanded to 24 teams in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], then to 32 in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. The one exception is Oceania, who have never had a guaranteed spot in the finals. In recent years, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, and those who have reached the knockout stage include: Mexico, quarterfinalists in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and reaching the knockout rounds in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]; [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], reaching the knockout rounds in 1986; [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], quarter-finalists in 1990; [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], reaching the knockout rounds in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]; [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], reaching the knockout rounds in 1994 and 1998; [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], reaching the knockout rounds in 1994; United States, reaching the knockout rounds in 1994 and quarter-finalists in 2002; [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], finishing in fourth place in 2002; [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]], quarter-finalists in 2002; [[Japan national football team|Japan]], reaching the knockout rounds in 2002; and [[Australia national football (soccer) team|Australia]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], both reaching the knockout rounds in 2006. However, European and South American teams have remained the stronger forces. For example, the quarter-finalists in 2006 were all from Europe or South America.

198 nations attempted to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and a record 204 will attempt to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/en/media/index/0,1369,134690,00.html Record number of 204 teams enter preliminary competition]</ref> [[Bhutan national football team|Bhutan]] remains the only FIFA member nation to have not entered the competition.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/t/team/profile.html?team=bhu Bhutan - team profile], FIFA World Cup site.

==Trophy==
:{{main|FIFA World Cup Trophy}}
[[Image:Wohlfahrtsbriefmarke-fifa.jpg|right|thumb|The [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] on a German [[Postage stamp|stamp]]]]
From 1930 to 1970, the ''[[FIFA World Cup Trophy#Jules Rimet Trophy|Jules Rimet Trophy]]'' was awarded to the World Cup winner. It was originally simply known as the ''World Cup'' or ''Coupe du Monde'', but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president [[Jules Rimet]] who set up the first tournament. In [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983, and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/h/rimet.html Jules Rimet Cup], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

After 1970, a new trophy, known as the ''[[FIFA World Cup Trophy#FIFA World Cup Trophy|FIFA World Cup Trophy]]'', was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven different countries, valued the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer [[Silvio Gazzaniga]]. The new trophy is 36 cm high, made of solid 18-[[carat (purity)|carat]] gold and weighs 6,175 grammes. The base contains two layers of semi-precious [[malachite]] while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: "The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory."<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/h/trophy.html FIFA World Cup Trophy], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently, irrespective of how many World Cups they win. World Cup winners retain the trophy until the next tournament and are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original. Argentina, Germany (as West Germany), Italy and Brazil have all won the second trophy twice, while France has won it once. It will not be retired until the name plaque has been entirely filled with the names of winning nations in 2038.

===Qualification===    
{{main|FIFA World Cup qualification}}   
Since the second World Cup in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]], qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament. They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams, but also subject to lobbying from the confederations.   
 
The qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental [[play-off]]s. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the South American zone entered a play-off to decide which team would qualify for the 2006 World Cup.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/t/match/index.html?st=zone&zone=sao&tm=all&ym=all Matches and Results], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> From the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] onwards, host nations have received an automatic berth in the finals. This right also used to be granted to the defending champion, but from the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] finals onwards, this entitlement has been withdrawn, requiring the champions to qualify as well.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/050901/1/4hs8.html Brazil's Juan warns against complacency], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Final tournament===
The current finals tournament features 32 national teams competing over a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: a ''group stage'' followed by a ''knockout stage''.

In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. The finals draw, held six months before the tournament in the host nation, determines the groups. Eight teams are [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded]] (including the hosts, with the other teams selected using a formula based on both the [[FIFA World Rankings]] and performances in recent World Cups) and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different "pots", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.

Each group plays a [[round-robin tournament]], guaranteeing that every team will play at least three matches. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among the teams.  The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage.  Points are used to rank the teams within a group.  Since [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[Three points for a win|three points have been awarded for a win]], one for a draw and none for a loss (prior to this, winners received two points rather than three).  If two or more teams end up with the same number of points, [[tiebreaker]]s are used: first is [[goal difference]], then total goals scored, then head-to-head results, and finally drawing of lots (i.e. determining team positions at random).<ref>{{cite web

The knockout stage is a [[single-elimination tournament]] in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with [[extra time]] and [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the "round of 16" (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the [[third place playoff|third-place match]] (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.

Below are the various formats used in previous tournaments:
*1930: A group stage, followed by a knockout stage with 4 teams (group winners; note that no third-place match was played)
*1934–1938: Single-elimination tournament; these are the only tournaments without a group stage
*1950: A first group stage, followed by a final group stage with 4 teams (group winners); this is the only tournament without an official final match
*1954–1970: A group stage, followed by a knockout stage with 8 teams (group winners and runners-up)
*1974–1978: A first group stage, followed by a second group stage with 8 teams (first round group winners and runners-up), followed by the final (second round group winners; second round group runners-up played in the third-place match)
*1982: A first group stage, followed by a second group stage with 12 teams (first round group winners and runners-up), followed by a knockout stage with 4 teams (second round group winners)
*1986–1994: A group stage, followed by a knockout stage with 16 teams (group winners, runners-up and the four best third-placed teams)
*1998–present: A group stage, followed by a knockout stage with 16 teams (group winners and runners-up)

==Selection of hosts==
{{main|FIFA World Cup hosts}}
<!-- Make sure that any changes made here is also reflected upon the article [[FIFA World Cup hosts]]. -->
Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The choice of location was highly controversial, given the three-week boat journey between [[South America]] and [[Europe]], the two centres of strength in football. The decision to hold the first World Cup in [[Uruguay]], for example, led to only four European nations competing.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632201.stm History of 1930 World Cup], BBC. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> The next two World Cups were both held in [[Europe]]. The decision to hold the second of these, the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], in [[France]] was controversial, as the American countries had been led to understand that the World Cup would rotate between the two continents. Both [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] thus boycotted the tournament.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1938.html France 1938], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> 

After the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]], to avoid any future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between [[Americas|the Americas]] and Europe, which continued until the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. The [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], hosted jointly by [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], was the first one held in [[Asia]] (and the only tournament with multiple hosts), and in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[South Africa]] will become the first [[Africa|African]] nation to host the World Cup.

The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's executive committee. This is done under a [[single transferable vote]] system. The national football association of the country who desires to host the event receives a guide called "Hosting Agreement" from FIFA, which explains the steps and indicates requirements that need to be met to offer a strong bid. The association that desires to celebrate the event also receives a form that the association must fill out and return to FIFA. This document represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the Cup is currently made six years in advance of the tournament. For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the hosting of the final tournament was rotated between its constituent confederations, and only countries from the chosen confederation may bid on the tournament.

After the 2010 FIFA World Cup was allocated to Africa, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] was allocated to South America in 2003, which will be the first held in South America since 1978. [[Brazil]] and [[Colombia]] had formally expressed the interest in hosting the tournament,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/en/media/index/0,1369,128212,00.html|title=Brazil and Colombia announce interest in hosting 2014 FIFA World Cup™|publisher=FIFA|date=[[2006-12-19]]|accessdate=2006-12-20}}</ref> but Colombia had withdrew and Brazil remains the sole bidder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/en/media/index/0,1369,135648,00.html?articleid=135648|title=Brazil confirms bid - Colombia withdraws|publisher=FIFA|date=[[2007-04-13]]|accessdate=2007-04-13}}</ref> However, if none of the candidates in South America meet the standards set by FIFA, the tournament may be moved to another continent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-6286262,00.html|title=Others ready if Brazil blow 2014 bid, says Blatter|publisher=The Guardian|date=[[2006-12-17]]|accessdate=2006-12-20}}</ref> Recently, FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]] indicated that "Brazil is likely to be the host", but also said that "I can't guarantee that Brazil will be the host, but the ball is on Brazil's court now."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/soccer/news_story/?ID=179167|title=Brazil in position to host 2014 World Cup|publisher=TSN|date=[[2006-09-28]]|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> The final decision is expected to be made by November 2007.

The [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] has not been allocated to any continent; in fact, the policy of continental rotation may not continue beyond 2014. Countries which have expressed an interest in hosting the 2018 World Cup include [[Australia]], [[England]], [[Russia]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and the [[United States]], while the [[Benelux]] countries ([[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]]) are planning a joint bid, after Belgium and the Netherlands successfully co-hosted the [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=385813&cc=5901|title=Benelux trio to apply to host 2018 World Cup|date=[[2006-10-16]]|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref> FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated on [[February 28]], [[2007]] that the World Cup, "should be in North America in 2018 and there are three countries who could host it there—the United States, Mexico and Canada."

===Successful national teams===
{{Mainlist|National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup}}
[[Image:World cup countries best results and hosts.PNG|250px|thumb|Map of countries' best results]]
In all, 78 nations have qualified at least once for the World Cup Finals. Of these, only eleven have made it to the final match, and only seven have won. The seven national teams that have won the World Cup have added [[Star (football crest)|stars to the crest]], located on their shirt, with each star representing a World Cup victory.

With five titles, Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have [[National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup#Ranking of teams by number of appearances|participated in every World Cup Finals]] so far. Italy follows with four titles, including the most recent one in 2006. Brazil and Italy are also the only nations to have won consecutive titles, each winning their first two titles back-to-back (Italy: 1934 and 1938; Brazil: 1958 and 1962). In 1970 and 1994, Brazil and Italy were finalists, each having a chance to become the first team to win a third title (and allowing them to keep the Jules Rimet trophy permanently) and a fourth title respectively. Brazil won both matches, and added a record fifth title in 2002. They have won the World Cup in the four continents that the World Cup has been hosted at (Europe: 1958; South America: 1962; North America: 1970 & 1994; Asia: 2002). The only other team to win a World Cup outside its own continental zone is Argentina (1986 in North America).

Italy, Brazil, West Germany,and Argentina, as well as non-champions Netherlands, are the only teams to have ever appeared in consecutive finals while Brazil and West Germany are the only two teams ever to appear in three consecutive World Cup final matches (1994, 1998, 2002 and 1982, 1986, 1990, respectively). Brazil won two out of the three (1994, 2002) and West Germany won only one. Of the eighteen World Cup final matches, only twice have the same two teams contested the match. Brazil and Italy played in 1970 and 1994, and West Germany and Argentina in 1986 and 1990 (West Germany and Argentina also became the only two teams to meet in consecutive finals). Every final match has also featured at least one out of Brazil, Italy, (West) Germany, and Argentina.

Below is a list of the 24 teams that have finished in the top four in a World Cup. Germany lead all nations with 11 top four finishes. Brazil and Germany lead all nations with the most appearances in the final match with seven appearances each.

===Performances by host nations===
Six of the seven champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exception being [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who lost the deciding match (known as [[Maracanazo]]) when they hosted the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] tournament.

[[England national football team|England]] ([[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]) and [[France national football team|France]] ([[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]) won their only titles while playing as host nations. [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] ([[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]), [[Italy national football team|Italy]] ([[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]) and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] ([[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while [[Germany national football team|Germany]] ([[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]) won their second cup title on home soil.

Other nations have also been successful during their spell as hosts. [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (runners-up in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]), [[Chile national football team|Chile]] (third place in [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]]), [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]] (fourth place in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]), [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] (quarterfinals in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]) and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] (second round in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]) all have their best results when serving as hosts. In fact, all host nations have progressed at least beyond the first round.

===Best performances by continental zones===
{{seealso|National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup#Performance by confederation}}

To date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by [[UEFA|European]] and [[CONMEBOL|South American]] teams. The two continents have won nine titles apiece. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: the USA (in 1930) and South Korea (in 2002). African teams have had some success of late but have never reached the semi-finals. Oceania have only been represented in the World Cup three times, and only once did a Oceanian team reached the second round.

Interestingly, all World Cups won by European teams have taken place in Europe. The only non-European team to win in Europe is Brazil in 1958. Only twice had consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent - when Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively.

|{{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Ademir Marques de Menezes|Ademir]]<ref>There was a controversy regarding the number of goals scored by the Ademir in 1950 because of incomplete data from the final group round game against Spain, that ended in a 6-1 victory for Brazil. The first goal had been credited to Spanish defender Parra as an own goal, and the fifth Brazilian goal was credited to Jair. However, recently FIFA credited Ademir with both these goals, thus making him the 1950 World Cup top scorer, with nine goals.</ref>, {{flagicon|Italy}} [[Roberto Baggio]], {{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Eusébio]], {{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Jairzinho]], {{flagicon|Italy}} [[Paolo Rossi]], {{flagicon|Germany}} [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]], {{flagicon|Germany}} [[Uwe Seeler]], {{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Vavá]], {{flagicon|Italy}} [[Christian Vieri]]
