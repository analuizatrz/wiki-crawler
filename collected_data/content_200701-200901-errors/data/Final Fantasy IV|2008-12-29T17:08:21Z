{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy IV'''''|ファイナルファンタジーIV|Fainaru Fantajī Fō}} is a [[console role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) in {{vgy|1991}} as a part of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. The game was originally released for the [[Super Famicom]] in Japan, but has been ported with minor changes to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] as well as by [[TOSE]] to the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]], [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy Advance]]. In May 2007, Square Enix announced that it was developing a [[Final Fantasy IV (Nintendo DS)|remake]] of the game for the [[Nintendo DS]].<ref name="gamespotnews">{{cite web | author=Niizumi, Hirohiko | title=Final Fantasy IV officially DS-bound | date=2007-05-12 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/finalfantasyiv/news.html?sid=6170682&om_act=convert&om_clk=newsfeatures&tag=newsfeatures;title;2 | publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref> The game was re-titled "''Final Fantasy II''" during its initial release in [[North America]] due to it being the second of the series released there, but later localizations used the original title.

The player takes the role of Cecil, a Dark Knight from the kingdom of Baron, on his journey to save the world from the evil Golbez. Struggling to prevent Golbez from acquiring powerful Crystals, Cecil learns of his heritage and travels through three realms to battle Golbez's minions. His lover, best friend, and other warriors join him for the adventure.<ref name="iiinstructions">{{cite book | year=1991 | editor=Square Co. | title=Final Fantasy II instruction manual | pages=74 | publisher=Square Co. | id=SFS-F4-USA-1}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ff4wiki.PNG|thumb|left|A battle scene from the Super Nintendo version of the game: the party engages a Blue Dragon on the Moon]]
In ''Final Fantasy IV'', the player controls a large cast of characters and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move and interact with people and enemies on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on a world map. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> Conversely, the player fights monsters at [[random encounter|random intervals]] on the world map and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special options.<ref name="iiinstructions"/>

Player characters and monsters have HP or [[hit point]]s (represented by a numerically based [[life bar]]); attacks reduce hit points until none are left, at which point the character faints or the monster dies. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> The player can restore the characters' hit points by having them sleep in an inn or use items in the party's inventory, such as a ''Potion''. Equipment (such as swords and armor) bought in towns or found in dungeons can be used to increase damage inflicted on monsters or minimize received damage.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> The player can choose whether characters appear on the front line of a battle or in reserve. A character's placement impacts distribution of damage received and inflicted.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> The game's story is [[linearity (computer and video games)|linear]]—the player can usually advance the game through only one path, although limited [[quest (gaming)#Side-quest|side quests]] are available.<ref name="allrpgreview">{{cite web | title=Review of Final Fantasy IV | date=2003-06-14 | url=http://www.allrpg.com/games/ff4/index.php3?page=review&num=1 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070706224046/http://www.allrpg.com/games/ff4/index.php3?page=review&num=1 | archivedate=2007-07-06 | publisher=AllRPG | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy IV'' introduced Square's [[Final Fantasy#Battle system|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]], who was one of the battle designers with [[Kazuhiko Aoki]] and [[Akihiko Matsui]], which differed from the turn-based designs of previous RPGs.<ref name="gafreview">{{cite web | author=Johnson, Robert | title=Final Fantasy IV Review | date=2003-04-28 | url=http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/review.php?reviewid=197 | publisher=GamesAreFun | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> The ATB system centers on the player inputting orders for the characters in real time during battles.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Advance instruction manual | pages=22 | publisher=Square Enix | id=AGB-BZ4E-USA}}</ref> An important precedent, ATB was used in many subsequent Square games.

Each character is balanced through certain strengths and weaknesses; for instance, a strong magic user may have low defense, while a physical fighter may have low agility. Like other ''Final Fantasy'' games, characters gain new, more powerful abilities with battle experience. Magic is classified as either "[[Final Fantasy magic#White Magic|White]]" for healing and support; "[[Final Fantasy magic#Black Magic|Black]]" for offense; or "[[Final Fantasy magic#Summon Magic|Summon]]" (or "call") for summoning monsters to attack or carry out specialized applications.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> A fourth type—"[[Final Fantasy character classes#Ninja|Ninjutsu]]"—consists of support and offensive magic and is available to only one character. Magic users, who account for eight of twelve playable characters, gain magic spells at preprogrammed experience levels or fixed story events. The developers have balanced point gains, items, and rewards to eliminate long sessions of gaining levels.<ref name="rpgamerreview"/> Due to the Super Nintendo's greater processing power, ''Final Fantasy IV'' contains graphics improved over past ''Final Fantasy'' titles and concurrent Super Nintendo games.<ref>{{cite web | author=Palley, Steve | year=2004 | title=Sail to the Moon: Final Fantasy II | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6132899/index.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2006-03-07}}</ref> The game employs the Super Nintendo's [[Mode 7]] technology to give enhanced magic spell visuals and to make [[List of Final Fantasy airships|airship]] travel more dramatic by scaling and tilting the ground for a bird's eye view.

===Setting===
Most of ''Final Fantasy IV'' takes place on [[Earth]], also known as the Blue Planet,<ref> '''Fusoya:''' Long ago, the world that lay between
the [[Mars|Red Planet]] and the [[Jupiter|Great Behemoth]] stood at the verge of destruction, both terrible and complete. The last survivors of that devastation boarded a ship and escaped to the Blue Planet. / '''Cecil''': Blue Planet? / '''Fusoya''': The one that you call home. But your planet was still in the midst of its evolution, you see. And so those travelers created a second moon for the planet, and there they settled into a long and quiet slumber. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS}}</ref> which consists of a surface world (or [[Overworld]]) and an underground world (or Underworld). The Overworld consists of territories populated by different [[Final Fantasy character classes|character class]]es from the series. The Underworld is primarily inhabited by the [[dwarf|Dwarven]] and is covered in rock and [[magma]]. A red, artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which two races, the Lunarians and the Hummingway live. A second, natural moon orbits as well, though it is never visited in the game. Travel among the three realms is accomplished through [[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Airships|airships]].

Besides the humans and Dwarven, there are two other important races in ''Final Fantasy IV'': The Hummingway are a race from the Moon, rabbit-like in appearance wearing blue and yellow clothing with turbans on their heads, however, some appear in pink and white. Most of them only speak in humming noises. One notable Hummingway is named Namingway, whose attire is red, and appears in most towns offering to change the names of the characters who talk to him. In [[Final Fantasy IX]], the player can find the Namingway card in Kuja's castle, or win it from Mario in the card arena. This card allows players to rename their characters.

The Lunarians are a race of human-like wizards who came from a world destroyed which became the [[asteroid belt]], and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the second moon that revolves around the world the story takes place on, resting until a time they believe their kind can co-exist with humans. The only known full-blood Lunarians are Fusoya, the guardian of the Lunarians; Zemus, a restless Lunarian who plans on destroying life on Earth so his kind, alone, can inhabit the planet; and Kluya, who is believed to be the first Lunarian to interact with humans. In fact, Kluya fell in love with a human, and had at least two sons with her: Theodor, whom Zemus corrupted and renamed Golbez; and the younger brother raised by the King of Baron as Cecil.

===Characters===
[[Image:FFIVkain.jpg|thumb|125px|Development sketch by [[Yoshitaka Amano]] of the character Kain]]
''Final Fantasy IV'' offers twelve playable characters, each with a unique [[character class]]. The hero, Cecil Harvey, is a [[Final Fantasy character classes#Dark Knight|Dark Knight]] of Baron who serves the king alongside his childhood friend Kain Highwind. Kain was once asked to become a Dark Knight, but instead followed his father's example and became Commander of the Dragoons. Rosa Farrell is the heroine and Cecil's girlfriend; she became a [[Final Fantasy character classes#White Mage|white mage]] and [[Final Fantasy character classes#Hunter|archer]] to protect Cecil as her mother protected her father.

===Story===
{{Plot|date=October 2008}}
''Final Fantasy IV'' begins as the unmatched [[monarchy]] of Baron sends the Red Wings to attack the mage city of Mysida to obtain the Water Crystal, one of four powerful Crystals. Cecil, Lord Captain of the Red Wings, questions the king's motives after stealing the Water Crystal, killing the mages who fought to protect their treasure. He is stripped of his rank as a result and with Kain sent to deliver a ring to the Village of Mist and slay the Mist Dragon that guards its borders. <ref>'''King of Baron:''' This is most unfortunate, but I can place no trust on one who offers none in return. I hereby relieve you of command of the Red Wings. / '''Cecil:''' My liege! / '''King:''' You will go now to the Valley of Mist instead. There is a task I would have you do. A phantom creature haunts the borders of that land-the Eidolon of Mist. You will slay it.. and deliver this ring to the village that lies beyond&nbsp;— they will know its meaning. Be gone by first light in the morning! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> Upon reaching the village, they discover the ring holds [[Final Fantasy bestiary (A-E)#Bomb|bombs]] which wreck the village and slaughtered many of its inhabitants. As the two decide to stop Baron's conquest, Cecil and Kain encounter Rydia, a young girl who appears to be the only survivor from the village, standing over her mother's body. Rydia's mother was the summoner who called forth the Mist Dragon to protect Mist from Baron, its death ending her life as well. <ref>'''Rydia:''' Mother, you can't die! Just because your dragon did... {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> Learning that Cecil is the one who killed her mother's Eidolon, the infuriated girl summons Titan to attack him and Kain; causing an earthquake that cuts off the route back to Baron and knocks the three unconscious. When Cecil awakens, he discovers that Kain has disappeared and the girl is injured. He carries her through a desert to an inn at the oasis town of Kaipo.   

Soldiers from Baron arrive in the night to take the girl from Cecil on orders from the king of Baron to kill all Summoners.<ref>'''Officer of Baron''': Our orders come directly from His Majesty's own mouth. Surrender the girl, and he will pardon all you've done. The inhabitants of Mist represent a threat to us all. They must not be allowed to live! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> But seeing Cecil protect her from them convinces Rydia to forgive and join him. While in Kaipo, Cecil discovers a bedridden Rosa; searching for Cecil, she had contracted Desert Fever, curable only by a "Sand Ruby", its location known to the royals of Damcyan, so Cecil and Rydia travel north to Castle Damcyan via the Waterfall. Along the way they meet the Sage Tellah in the waterway, hindered by the Octomammoth as he is also traveling to Damcyan in search of his daughter Anna, who ran off there with a bard.<ref>'''Tellah''': My daughter Anna was tricked by a silver-tongued bard. He's taken her to Damcyan Castle. I fear I've little time. I sense something sinister. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS| developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> The three arrive just in time to witness the Red Wings bombard the castle. In investigating the ruins of the castle, they discover that Anna was killed in the assault when she took the arrows for her lover, who is actually Prince Edward. <ref>'''Tellah''': You--you're that bard! You the one responsible for this! / '''Edward''': No Please! / '''Tellah''': You spoony bard! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS| developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> Edward explains that a man named Golbez, the Red Wings' new commander, orchestrated the attack and stole Damcyan's Fire Crystal,<ref>'''Edward''': The Red Wings laid siege to us, led by a man named Golbez. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS| developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> prompting Tellah to leave the party to seek vengeance on Golbez for Anna's death.<ref>'''Tellah''': Tears do not bring back the dead, boy! Anna's death must be avenged. I'll find this Golbez! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> After Cecil reveals to him his quest to save Rosa, Edward joins him and Rydia in retrieving the Sand Pearl, which is located in the Antlion's nest.   

At Kaipo, the revived Rosa joins the party; they resolve to go to Fabul to protect the Wind Crystal from being stolen by Golbez and the Red Wings. While crossing Mt. Hobs they encounter Yang, the head of the Fabul Monks, being ambushed by Golbez's monsters; the party helps him fight them off. Yang requests Cecil's help in defending Fabul after they inform him of Golbez's plot.<ref>'''Yang?''' I am grafeful for the offer, but there is no reason for you to be dragged any further into this. / '''Cecil''': Our stake in this conflict is no less than yours. / '''Yang''': I see. Than I will most humble accept whatever help you are willing to provide. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> The Red Wings attack Castle Fabul and Cecil's party falls back to the Wind Crystal's room. There, Cecil is confronted by his friend Kain and learns Kain is allied with Golbez, unaware that his Kain is being controlled. Kain challenges and defeats Cecil in a duel.<ref> '''Kain''': It's been some time, Cecil. / '''Cecil''': Kain! You're alive! / '''Kain''': I am. / '''Cecil''': You'll fight, then? / '''Kain''': Of course. That's the very reason I've come. But, Cecil...The one I'll fight is you! / '''Cecil''': Kain!? / '''Kain''': A duel, Cecil! / '''Cecil''': What do you mean? / '''Kain''': Draw your blade! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> When Rosa intervenes, Golbez arrives and kidnaps her as he commands Kain to take the Wind Crystal. The next morning, the party concludes that they will need an airship to confront Golbez's Red Wings. They decide to sneak into Baron to acquire an airship from Cid.<ref>'''Edward''': We must formulate a plan. / '''Cecil''': If we're to take on Golbez, we need an airship. But the only man who knows how to build one is in Baron. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> Yang charters a ship to take Cecil, Edward, Rydia, and himself to Baron. While sailing, however, their ship is attacked by the Lord of All Seas, [[Leviathan]].   

Cecil awakens alone on a beach near Mysidia, where he is met with contempt by the town's wizards for stealing the Water Crystal earlier.<ref> '''Elder''': You are the dark knight who came before. Why have you returned to this hallowed hall? / '''Cecil''': My name is Cecil, and until recently I served as Lord Captain of Baron's airship fleet. When I came before, I did so at the order of my king--orders I lacked the courage to disobey. / '''Elder''': You've come to apologize, then? Words do not wound, dark knight, nor do they restore life's flame to those whose candles you have doused. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> However, the Mysidian elder understands Cecil's plight, and tells him that to defeat Golbez, Cecil must climb Mt. Ordeals, which he must relinquish being a Dark Knight and become a Paladin.<ref> '''Elder''': First you must ascend the mountain and trade your dark sword for one of light. Should the hallowed light deem you worthy, you will be made a paladin--a warrior of virtue. But know it will be no easy trail, Manyare the man who have scaled the mountain, but not one has returned. Will you try where all others have failed? / '''Cecil''': I will! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> The elder sends twin wizards Palom and Porom to assist and spy on Cecil.<ref> '''Elder''': Forgive me. It pained me to do so, but I sent these two along to keep watch on you--to ensure your intentions were pure. It seems there was no need. Palom, Porom---you've done a fine job / '''Palom''': Well, now you know./ '''Porom''': I'm terribly sorry I couldn't tell you.{{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> On the mountain, they encounter Tellah, who is searching for the forbidden spell Meteor to defeat Golbez.<ref> '''Cecil''': Weren't you planning to go after Golbez?. /'''Tellah''': Yes, but my mage is no match for a man of his strength. I've been searching for the legendary magic of Meteor. It has been long sealed aswat, and I know not where. But I feel a powerful aura radiating from this place. I believe the spell I seek may well rest within this mountain. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> Golbez attempts to stop the party by sending Scarmiglione, one of the Four Archfiends, to kill them.<ref>'''Golbez''': This...Cecil, I fear we can ignore him no longer. Let us clip his wings now, before he flies beyond our reach. The young man is a dark knight. His blade will be all but useless against your legion of undead--at least for now. He ascend Mount Ordeals even as we speak. / '''Scarmiglione''': He meansss to become a paladin? / '''Golbez''': Yes. And I mean to see that he does not. The matter of his passing I leave to you. / '''Scarmiglione''': Worry not. It shall be as you wish. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> But the party defeats the archfiend, Cecil completes the trials, defeating his darkness to become a Paladin; Tellah also learns the secret of Meteor. Upon returning to Mysidia, the town elder is impressed that Cecil successfully became a Paladin and reveals a legend behind the sword he carries. Deciding to aid them, the Elder allows Cecil use of the "Devil's Road," a pathway that takes the party to Baron. There, Cecil learns that Cid has been arrested and Yang brainwashed into the service of Baron after suffering memory loss. After helping Yang regain his memory, Cecil, Yang, and the others infiltrate the castle and discover that the "king" is actually the Archfiend Cagnazzo who murdered the real king to assume his place.<ref>'''Cecil''': What have you done with the king!? / '''"King of Baron"''': Would you like to go and see him, that king of yours? You best not mistake me for another Scarmiglione. How one as weak as he came to be crowned an archfiend is something I will never know.

However, with his last breath, Cagnazzo traps the heroes in the antechamber and causes its walls to move with the intent of crushing the party.<ref>'''Cagnazzo:''' The Drowned King, Cagnazzo, deposed! But the wicked are not to fall alone. Ha ha ha ha ha! In life, I was terrible--In death, steeped in terror greater still.

Cecil takes command of the Enterprise and is met at takeoff by the brainwashed Kain, who demands Cecil retrieve the final Crystal in exchange for Rosa's life. <ref>'''Cecil:''' Where's Rosa?

At the tower's summit, Golbez takes the Crystal and attempts to flee. Tellah tries to kill Golbez by using Meteor at the cost of his life, managing to weaken Golbez, and seemingly shatter his control over Kain's mind, who had a realization about Cecil before he left.<ref>'''Golbez:''' So, the old man's interference servered by hold over you. No matter. Your purpose is served. Do not think this affront will be forgiven. / Cecil: Why...why now stay your hand?/Golbez: You're--You..But--how?...? We will finish this another time. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> Kain helps Cecil rescue Rosa and, after defeating the Archfiend Barbariccia, the party escapes to Baron when the Tower starts to collapse.   

In Baron, Kain reveals that Golbez must also obtain four subterranean "Dark Crystals" to achieve his goal.<ref>'''Cecil''': Kain, we've lost the Earth Crystal. Golbez holds all them now. / '''Kain''': No. he holds four. / '''Rosa''': You mean to say there are more? / '''Cid''': Come to think it, I've heard tales of others! You speak of the Dark Crystals? / '''Kain''': I do. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> Cecil swears to defend the Crystals; Kain gives him a "Magma Rock" he obtained while in the service of Golbez, which opens a passage to the Underworld. They fly through the opening, but their airship is soon damaged while caught in the cross-fire of a battle between the [[Dwarves]]' tanks and the airships of the Red Wings, forcing it to crash outside the Castle of Dwarves. King Giott of the dwarves accepts Cecil's offer to guard the Crystals. Cid departs to repair and upgrade the airship; soon after he leaves, Cecil, Rosa, Yang, and Kain discover Golbez has infiltrated the dwarves' crystal room and try to stop his theft of the Crystal. During the battle they are joined by Rydia, now an adult since she was taken by Leviathan to the Feymarch, the land of the Eidolons.<ref>'''Rydia:''' When we were attacked, Leviathan swallowed me and carried me to the land of the Eidolons.. / '''Cecil''': The Land of the Eidolons? / '''Rydia''': The Feymarch--the place they call home. I live among them and befriended them. I can use white magic anymore, but my summoning and black magic have grown stronger. Time flows differently in the Feymarch, though... / '''Cecil''': So that's why you've grown so much. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> However, Golbez escapes with the Dwarves' Dark Crystal, and Cecil sets out to the Tower of Babil to retrieve the lost crystals. King Giott offers the services of his tanks to draw the fire of the tower's defenses while the party infiltrates it. While inside, the party confronts the servant of Golbez, Dr. Lugae. He informs the party that the crystals have been moved to the above ground portion of the Tower, and as his last act Dr. Lugae orders that the Tower's Super Cannon destroy the dwarf tanks. Yang volunteers to stay behind and destroy the Super Cannon while the party escapes, and is presumed dead. Upon escaping the Tower the party is met by Cid and a repaired Enterprise. They are pursued by the Red Wings and fly back to the upper world to escape them; Cid throws himself overboard and detonates a bomb to re-seal the passage, apparently [[suicide bombing|sacrificing himself]].<ref>'''Cid:''' Once you breach surface, I'll seal off that hold for good--with this! / '''Rosa''': No! Not you too! / '''Cid''': I was hopping I'd get to see your kids someday, but, well--someone's got to keep Yang company! You get yourselves back to Baron.

Back on the surface, they find the path to the Tower of Babil's upper half. While following it they are joined by Edge, the ninja prince of Eblan, who seeks revenge for his parents against Rubicante, last of the Archfiends. Inside the tower, the party defeats Rubicante after Edge is forced to kill his parents, now monsters thanks to Lugae's experiments.<ref> '''Edge''': Rubicante! For this...for this you will pay! / '''Rubicante''': It was Lugae who made chimerae of your parents. I share no hand in his perversities. They shame me, as they grieve you. / '''Edge''': Don't speak of shame! / '''Rubicante''': I respect men like you. Men with...courage. But you are a slave to your emotions, and so will never know true strength. Such is the curse of Men. / '''Edge''': You think our rage--a weakness? Then let me show you how wrong you are! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> After falling through a trap door to an Underground portion of the Tower, the party finds an abandoned Red Wing airship and use the dubbed "Falcon" to head towards the Underworld's Sealed Cave to retrieve the eighth and final crystal before Golbez gets to it. After they do so, however, Golbez reveals he still had control over Kain, having him pretend to be normal until the last crystal was in his grasp.<ref> '''Golbez''': Kain...Return to me, my pawn...Deliver to me the Crystal... / '''Cecil''': Golbez! / '''Cecil''': Kain! / Rosa: Don't listen!

Cecil returns to Mysidia to pray for the Lunar Whale's appearance. It rises from the ocean, and Cecil, Rosa, Rydia, and Edge board it to travel to the moon.   

Upon arriving on the moon, the party enters the Lunar Palace, and there the party meets an elderly man named Fusoya who explains that Cecil's father is a heroic but deceased Lunarian.<ref> ''''Cecil''': And the Lunar Whale, where did it come from? / '''Fusoya''': Ah, the ship...My younger brother KluYa built that vessel long ago, and flew it to the Blue Planet. He took with him several of our secrets, such as the ones employed in your Devil's Road and in airships--a gift to your people. Kluya was fascinated by your planet and wished to know more about it.

And so I used by powers to force him into hibernation with the others. But as he slept, his will grew stronger and took on a consciousness all its own. It reached out to men with tainted hearts on your planet, twisting them into beings yet darker still. And through them, he began to gather the Crystals. / '''Cecil''': So he was manipulating Golbez! / '''Edge''': Does this guy have a name? / '''Fusoya''': His name is Zemus. The Crystals function as a source of energy you see. I fear he has gathered them in order to activate the interdimenional elevator within the Tower of Babil. With it, he will be able to transport the Giant of Babil to your planet and use it to extinguish all life there.{{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS | language=English }}</ref> Meanwhile on Earth, the forces of the world, including some characters (Yang, Palom, Porom) thought to have died, attack the unleashed Giant.

==Development==
After completing ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'' in 1990, Square planned to develop two ''Final Fantasy'' games—one for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Famicom]] and the other for the forthcoming [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]], to be known as ''Final Fantasy IV'' and ''Final Fantasy V'' respectively.<ref name="lostlevels">{{cite web | author=Collette, Chris | year=2003 | title=Elusions: Final Fantasy IV / Seiken Densetsu | url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200311/200311-square.shtml | publisher=Lost Levels Online | accessdate=2006-03-01}}</ref> Due to financial and scheduling constraints, Square dropped plans for the Famicom game and continued development of the Super Famicom version, retitled ''Final Fantasy IV''. A mock-up screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little other information exists about it.<ref name="lostlevels"/>

===Audio===
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy IV}}
The score of ''Final Fantasy IV'' was written by longtime series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Uematsu has noted that the process of composing was excruciating, involving trial and error and requiring the sound staff to spend several nights in sleeping bags at Square Co. headquarters. His notes were humorously signed as being written at 1:30 AM "in the office, naturally."<ref>{{cite web | author=Uematsu, Nobuo | title=Final Fantasy IV OSV Liner Notes | staff=Rebecca Capowski | date=1991-04-13 | url=http://chudahs-corner.com/liners/index.php?catalog=PSCN-5014 | publisher=Chudah's Corner | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> The score was well received; reviewers have praised the quality of the composition despite the limited medium.<ref name="gafreview"/><ref name="rpgfanreview"/><ref name="allrpgreview"/> The track "Theme of Love" has even been taught to Japanese school children as part of the music curriculum.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hitmitsu, Suppai | title=Final Fantasy Becomes Curriculum | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=2004-03-31 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/503/503226p1.html | accessdate=2006-03-01}}</ref> Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his ''Final Fantasy'' concert series.<ref>{{cite web | author=Schneider, Peer | title=Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=2005-05-11| url=http://music.ign.com/articles/513/513292p1.html | accessdate=2006-03-01}}</ref>

Three [[album]]s of music from ''Final Fantasy IV'' have been released in Japan. The first album, ''[[Music of Final Fantasy IV#Final Fantasy IV Original Sound Version|Final Fantasy IV: Original Sound Version]]'', was released on June 14, 1991 and contains 44 tracks from the game. The second album was ''[[Music of Final Fantasy IV#Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon|Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon]]'', released on October 24, 1991, contains a selection of tracks from the game, [[Arrangement|arranged]] and performed by [[Celtic music]]ian [[Máire Breatnach]]. Lastly, ''[[Music of Final Fantasy IV#Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV|Final Fantasy IV Piano Collections]]'', an arrangement of tracks for solo piano performed by [[Toshiyuki Mori]], was released on April 21, 1992 and began the ''Piano Collections'' trend for each successive ''Final Fantasy'' game. Several tracks have appeared on ''Final Fantasy'' compilation albums produced by Square, including ''[[The Black Mages (album)|The Black Mages]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy: Pray]]''. Independent but officially licensed releases of ''Final Fantasy IV'' music have been orchestrated by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focused on arranging video game music.<ref>{{cite web | author=KFSS Studios | title=Music Store | publisher=MajesticMix.com | year=2002 | url=http://www.majesticmix.com/documents/music.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070626165226/http://www.majesticmix.com/documents/music.html | archivedate=2007-06-26 | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called ''[[dojin music]]'', and on English remixing websites such as [[OverClocked ReMix]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Game: Final Fantasy IV (1991, Square, SNES) - OverClocked ReMix | url=http://www.ocremix.org/game/final-fantasy-iv-snes/ | publisher=[[OverClocked ReMix]] | accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

==Versions and re-releases==
''Final Fantasy IV'' has been re-released on several platforms. To date, an easy version of ''Final Fantasy IV'' has been released for the Super Famicom, and the game was ported to the [[PlayStation]] (in 1997). A graphically enhanced remake was released on the [[WonderSwan Color]] (in 2002), and the [[Game Boy Advance]] (in 2005). The game was also completely remade with 3D graphics for the [[Nintendo DS]] (in 2008).

===''Final Fantasy II'' (North America)===
Because the previous two installments of the ''Final Fantasy'' series had not been localized and released in North America at the time, ''Final Fantasy IV'' was distributed as ''Final Fantasy II'' to maintain naming continuity. Later remakes of the game have been released in North America under the original title. While the game retains the storyline, graphics, and sound of the original, developers significantly reduced the difficulty for beginning gamers. Certain items were less expensive or rare, and several battle commands were removed—including Tellah's ''Recall'' (allowing him to use a random magic spell), Edward's ''Medicine'' (which used Potions from the player's inventory to heal the entire party), and Cecil's ''DarkWave'' (an attack which targeted all enemies but sacrificed a portion of his health). Several enemies and bosses were reduced in strength and assigned special weaknesses. Entrances to secret passages on field maps were outlined in blue, whereas they were invisible in the original Japanese version. The random encounter rate was reduced, although overall enemy health became increased. The translation was changed in accordance with Nintendo of America's [[censorship]] policies (at the time before the formation of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] and its rating system), and certain errors were introduced during [[Internationalization and localization#Software localization|localization]].<ref>{{cite web | title=25 Dumbest Moments in Gaming / Nintendo's Mortal Mistake | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/index4.shtml | date=2003-06-14 | author=GameSpy Staff | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | accessdate=2006-03-06}}</ref>

Certain character descriptions and elements of backstory have been cut due to space limitations. For instance, Kain's background and relationship with his father and the motivations for Zemus's plans to colonize Earth are not in the game.<ref name="mobygamestrivia">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy IV Trivia | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/final-fantasy-iv/trivia | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref> The logo for the U.S. version features the same font and sword-letter-T emblem used in the Game Boy ''[[Final Fantasy Legend]]'' series rather than an image of Kain, which was used for the ''Final Fantasy IV'' title logo (and was used for its later releases as well). Other changes include the removal of overt Judeo-Christian religious references and certain potentially objectionable graphics. The magic spell ''Holy'' has been renamed ''White''. All references to [[prayer]] are eliminated; the Tower of Prayers in Mysidia is renamed the Tower of Wishes, though the White Mage in the tower still calls it "Tower of Prayers," and Rosa's ''Pray'' command is absent. Direct references to death are omitted, although several characters clearly die over the course of the game. An odd form of censorship was present during the rescue of Rosa from the Tower of Zott; in the original Japanese version, she was about to be sliced in half by a giant metal scythe. In the North American release, this was changed into a giant metal ball. Additionally, anything considered too risqué has been censored, such as bikinis on town dancers (replaced by leotards). The Programmers' Room special feature (in which the player can find a ''Porno Magazine'') has been removed.<ref name="ffcompendium-translation">{{cite web | author=Kelley, Ian | title=FF4j/FF4j Easytype Changes FAQ | url=http://www.ffcompendium.com/h/faqs/ff4versions.txt | publisher=FFCompendium | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref> New promotional character art was made for published previews.<ref name="npreview"/>  The runes that served as save points were changed into "Save Circles", which is the letter S in a circle with a fancy border.

In addition to the content edits, one major gameplay function was altered: The multiplayer option, which operated similarly to the same option in [[Final Fantasy VI]], was completely removed, as was the ability to edit controller settings.<!-- Active/Wait "Battle Mode" and Cursor Memory (both like FFVI) were also removed, if someone considers that worth mentioning. --><ref>{{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Co | date=1991-07-19 | platform =Super Famicom | language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy II | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1991-11-23 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System}}</ref>

These edits prompted the creation of an English language [[fan translation]] of the original script, produced by J2e Translations.<ref>{{cite web | author=Maxwell, Brian | title=B-Rock's Homepage | publisher=Brian Maxwell| year=2003 | url=http://b-rock.netfirms.com | accessdate=2006-03-01}}</ref> The fan translation uses the original version of the game and not the ''Easytype.''

===''Final Fantasy IV Easytype''===
A modified version of the game was released for the Super Famicom in Japan under the name ''Final Fantasy IV Easytype''. Built from the untranslated template of the US version{{Fact|date=August 2008}}, the ''Easytype'' has been modified to be even easier than its North American counterpart. Because the ''Easytype'' was released before ''Final Fantasy II'', fans and critics continue to erroneously claim that the US version was made from this version.<ref name="ignreview"/>

In the ''Easytype'', the attack powers of weapons have been enhanced, while the protective abilities of certain accessories and armor are amplified (such as the Ribbon, which protects against all magic). The developers have removed the instant killing technique of an enemy called ''The Tricker''. The final boss, Zeromus, has been redesigned as a sword-wielding, skull-crowned scorpion, and a new battle pattern has been created for the beast.<ref name="ffcompendium-monster">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Bosses 3 | url=http://www.ffcompendium.com/h/espmon/bosses3.shtml | publisher=FFCompendium | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref>

===PlayStation===
{{main|Final Fantasy Chronicles}}
A PlayStation re-release debuted in Japan on March 21, 1997. Ported by [[TOSE]] and published by [[Square Co.]], it was designed and directed by [[Kazuhiko Aoki]], supervised by Fumiaki Fukaya, and produced by Akihiro Imai.<ref name="Chronicles">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=54 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-01360}}</ref> This version is identical to the original game, although minor tweaks introduced in the ''Easytype'' are present. The most notable changes in the PlayStation release are the inclusion of [[full motion video]] opening & ending sequences, the ability to move quickly in dungeons and towns by holding the Cancel button, and the option of performing a "memo" save anywhere on the world map.<ref name="Chronicles"/>

On March 11, 1999, this version was released a second time in Japan as part of the ''Final Fantasy Collection'' package, which also included the PlayStation versions of ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''.<ref name="Release">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Collection | url=http://www.square-enix.com/jp/archive/ff_collection/ | work=[http://www.square-enix.com/jp/archive/ff_collection/ Square-Enix.com] (Japanese) | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> Fifty-thousand limited edition copies of the collection were also released and included a ''Final Fantasy''-themed alarm clock.<ref name="Prerelease">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Collection Coming | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/066/066337p1.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN.com] | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref>

This version was later released with ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' in North America as part of ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' in 2001 and with ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' in Europe and Australia as part of ''[[Final Fantasy Anthology]]'' in 2002. The English localizations feature a new translation, which addresses discrepancies between the original by [[Takashi Tokita]] and ''Final Fantasy II'', although certain lines from the previous localization by [[Kaoru Moriyama]] - such as "You spoony bard!" - were kept, as they had become fan favorites.<ref name="ffcompendium-bard">{{cite web | title=Famous Moments in Final Fantasy | url=http://www.ffcompendium.com/h/moment.shtml | publisher=FFCompendium | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref> The developers have also fixed certain bugs present in the Japanese version, including slow-down issues with music.

===WonderSwan Color===
A remake for the WonderSwan Color was released in Japan on March 28, 2002. Character sprites and backgrounds have been graphically enhanced through heightened details and color shading.<ref name="WonderSwan">{{cite web | author=Joseph Witham | title=Final Fantasy IV WonderSwan Color Details | date=2002-02-22 | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2002/022302b.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref> These enhancements have since carried over to the Game Boy Advance port.<ref name="ignreview"/>

===Game Boy Advance===<!-- This section is linked from List of Game Boy Advance games -->
''Final Fantasy IV'' was ported a second time by [[TOSE]] and released as {{nihongo|''Final Fantasy IV Advance''|ファイナルファンタジーIVアドバンス|Fainaru Fantajī Fō Adobansu}}. It was released in [[North America]] by Nintendo of America on December 12, 2005; in Japan by [[Square Enix]] on December 15, 2005; in Australia on February 23, 2006; and in Europe on June 2, 2006. The [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rated it E-10 (Everyone 10 and older) and the [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] designated it for all ages. In Japan, a special version was available which included a limited edition [[Game Boy Micro]] with a themed face plate featuring artwork of Cecil and Kain.<ref name="faceplate">{{cite web | year=2005 | title=Final Fantasy IV Advance | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/ff4a/ | publisher=[[Square Enix]] | accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref>

The developers made several changes for this release. The enhanced graphics from the WonderSwan Color port have been even further improved, and minor changes have been made to the music. Earlier versions of the port suffered from a number of bugs and technical issues, however these were fixed for the European release. The localization team revised the English translation, improving the flow of the story, and certain plot details absent from the original have been restored.<ref name="ignreview"/> The player can change characters among Edward, Yang, Porom, Palom, and Cid after defeating the Giant of Babel, although Cecil must be in the party at all times. Two new dungeons have been added: a new cave at Mt. Ordeals featuring powerful armor and stronger weapons for five additional characters, and the Lunar Ruins, accessible only at the end of the game.<ref name="ignreview"/> New trials exist for each character at this location, reachable only after a particular character has defeated the final boss; for example, Cid's trial involves ferrying people around in an airship, and Rydia's trial involves fighting her own summons. The Lunar Ruins feature some of the best items in the game and another version of Zeromus to fight. This is his alternate [[scorpion]] form from the ''Easytype'' version, dubbed Zeromus EG. Also available for battle are a superboss named Brachioraidos and lunar versions of the summons, comparable to the dark aeons in ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''.<ref name="ff4bestiary">{{cite web | year=2005 | title=Final Fantasy IV Advance Bestiary | url=http://finalfantasy.neoseeker.com/final_fantasy_iv/GBA/pages/bestiary_final_fantasy_iv_advance/ | publisher=Final Fantasy Neoseeker | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref>

Up to three game saves are possible. In addition, a "quick save" function is available in which the player can save the game anywhere (except in battle or dialogue), but the saved data is lost if he/she continues from that save point. Completing the game unlocks a music player.
