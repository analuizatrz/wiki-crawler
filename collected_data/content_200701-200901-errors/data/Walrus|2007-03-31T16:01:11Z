'''Walruses''' are large semi-aquatic [[mammal]]s that live in the cold [[Arctic]] seas of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].  There are 6 populations in the arctic and 2 or 3 subspecies exist: 4 in the Atlantic, ''Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus'', 1 in the Pacific, ''Odobenus r. divergens'' and some consider the 6th in the [[Laptev Sea]] to be a third subspecies, ''Odobenus r. laptevi''. The Pacific walrus is slightly larger, with males weighing up to 1,900 kg (4,180 lb), but Atlantic males top out at 1,600 kg (3,500 lb). The walrus should not be confused with the [[elephant seal]], another large [[pinniped]], and despite the [[etymology]] of its name (variously attributed to combinations of the Dutch words for "whale" ''walvis'' and "horse" ''ros''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/walrus] or "shore" ''wal'' and "giant" ''reus''[http://www.iberianature.com/trivia/etymology_mammals.htm]), it is not related to the [[whale]]s. The most likely origin of the word is Old Norse ''hrossvalr'' "horse-whale", which was passed in a juxtaposed form to Dutch and the North-German dialects of the Hanseatic league as walros, Walross [Dansk Etymologisk Ordbog, Niels Age Nielsen, Gyldendal 1966].  
 
Walruses are members of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]] and [[suborder]] (or alternatively [[superfamily]]) [[Pinnipedia]]. They are the only members in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Odobenidae'''. The compound '''''Odobenus''''' comes from ''odous'' (Greek for "tooth") and ''baino'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "walk"), based on observations of walruses using their tusks to pull themselves out of the water. ''Divergens'' in [[Latin]] means "turning apart", referring to the tusks. 

==Lifestyle and feeding==

Walruses spend about half their time in the water and half their time on beaches or ice floes, where they gather in large herds. They may spend several days at a time either on land or in the sea. Diving to depths of 90 m (300 ft), they sometimes stay under for as long as a half hour. They use their [[pectoral]] flippers to move along out of water and can stand on all fours with an awkward gait when on rough surfaces. 

In the sea they sometimes catch fish, but generally graze along the sea bottom for clams which they suck from the shell. Pacific walruses feed on more than 60 genera of marine organisms including shrimp, crabs, [[tube worms]], soft coral, [[tunicates]], [[sea cucumbers]], various [[mollusks]], and even parts of other [[pinnipeds]]. Abrasion patterns of the tusks show that the tusks are dragged through the sediment but are not used to dig up prey and the upper edge of the snout is used instead.  Walruses can also spit jets of water to look for clams. Clams and mollusks frequently form the large part of their diet.  Large male walruses have been observed to attack seals if they cannot find any other food source.

Walruses have only two natural enemies: the [[orca]] and the [[polar bear]].  Polar bears hunt walruses by rushing at them, trying to get the herd to flee, then picking off calves or other stragglers.  Walruses have been known to kill polar bears. 

Walruses use their long tusks (elongated [[tooth|canines]]) for fighting, dominance, and display and the males will spar with their tusks. They can also use them to form and maintain holes in the ice, or to anchor themselves with the ice.

==Physical description and life cycle==


Walruses have thick skin and it can get to 5cm (2in) thick around the neck and shoulders of males.

Walruses live around 50 years.  The males reach sexual maturity around 10 years yet some as early as 7. They go into rut in January through April, increasing their food intake before the rut, yet then decreasing their food intake dramatically and eating only sporadically during the rut. The females can begin ovulating as soon as 4–6 years old. Interestingly the females are polyestrous, coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are only fertile around February so the animals are in practicality monoestrous. It is unclear why the females have this second season of potential fertility. By ten years old the females have reached maximum size and all are fertile by then. They breed in January to March with peak conception in February, and perhaps have a [[delayed implantation]] for a few months (4-5) with total [[gestation]] lasting 15–16 months. Walruses mate in the water and give birth on land or ice floes. The males show off in the water for the females who view them from pack ice. Males compete with each other aggressively for this display-space; the winners in these fights breed with large numbers of females. Older male walruses frequently bear large scars from these bloody but rarely fatal battles. 
When a calf is born, it is over 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) long and able to swim. The calves are born on the pack ice generally April to June and then generally nurse for 8–11 months before they begin eating fish on their own and can spend 3 to 5 years with the mothers. 

===Pacific===
About 200,000 Pacific walruses exist.  Pacific walruses spend the summer north of the [[Bering Strait]] in the [[Chukchi Sea]] along the north shore of eastern [[Siberia]], around [[Wrangel Island]], in the [[Beaufort Sea]] along the north shore of [[Alaska]], and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the [[Gulf of Anadyr]] on the south shore of the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] of Siberia and in Bristol Bay off the south shore of southern Alaska west of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. In the spring and fall they congregate in the Bering Strait, adjacent to the west shores of Alaska, and in the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter to the south in the Bering Sea along the eastern shore of Siberia south to the northern part of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], and along the southern shore of Alaska. The Pacific walruses can have longer tusks and smaller noses.

===Atlantic===
About 15,000 Atlantic walruses exist: they live in the Canadian Arctic, in the waters of [[Greenland]], of [[Svalbard]] and of the western portion of the Russian Arctic. The Atlantic walrus once enjoyed a range that extended south to [[Cape Cod]] and occurred in large numbers in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]].

==Medical problems==

Eye problems for the walrus are common and they sometimes experience intestinal disease. They sometimes get tusk infections, and in captivity are prone to ingesting foreign objects. Also various common fungal and bacterial sometimes cause minor infections. Trampling and tusk injuries occur during interactions and sometimes females are harassed and show bruises and laceration. 

The Atlantic walruses show exposure to the bacteria [[Brucella]] and sometimes will show infection with [[Trichinella]] and also lice. [[Calicivirus]]es are thought to sometimes affect Pacific walruses causing skin lesions and they are thought to have a wide exposure to the viruses. These viruses are thought to interact between terrestrial and aquatic mammals, with marine mammals showing antibodies to many caliciviruses that affect land mammals. [[Herpesvirus]]es can also be seen sometimes in the walrus population.

Walruses in captivity often suffer tusk injuries from banging them against their enclosures, which do not have the "give" of their natural habitat.  This chipping or breaking frequently leads to infection and often removal of the tusks, as large-scale infections in the tusks can become life-threatening.  The removal is usually not a problem for the captive walruses, as they have no need to climb on ice and typically only one male is kept per group, so there is no competition.

==The walrus in popular culture==
In [[western culture]], fiction often depicts the species—with its plump body, bushy mustache, and peacefully sleepy expression—as a happy, lovable and friendly animal, and its appearance may be interpreted as somewhat comical.

===In literature and music===

*[[Farley Mowat]]'s book ''[[Sea of Slaughter]]'' has a large section dedicated to the effects of hunting on eastern Canada's walrus population. 
*[[Lewis Carroll]]'s famous [[poem]] "[[The Walrus and the Carpenter]]" inspired the 1967 song "[[I Am the Walrus]]" by [[The Beatles]]. In the song [[John Lennon]] is "the Walrus". However, in order to deliberately confuse his fans, Lennon sings in the later song "[[Glass Onion]]" that "the Walrus was Paul". In the solo song "God," Lennon sings "I was the Walrus, but now, I'm John."
*''[[The Walrus]]'' is a Canadian news magazine.
*In [[Salman Rushdie]]'s children's book ''[[Haroun and the Sea of Stories]]'', The Walrus is the name of the imposing Grand Controller of Gup.
*''Walrus'' is also the name of Captain Flint's ship in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]''.

===In other media===
The Walrus is a very commonly seen animal in [[animation]]. They are usually portrayed as rugged but experienced and lovable characters, or as aristocratic characters due to the animal's snout looking somewhat like a mustache.
