At 13 he realized that he found men attractive, and [[Coming out|came out]] to his  family at 16. "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though my father did raise his voice. On the second day, and the third, and the fourth, there was this terrible silence. They treated me like an alien."<ref name="Global Gayz"/> However, his mother was supportive.
