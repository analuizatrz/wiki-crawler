'''Subhas Chandra Bose''', ({{lang-bn|সুভাষ চন্দ্র বসু}}, ([[January 23]], [[1897]] &ndash; [[Death in absentia|presumably]] [[August 18]], [[1945]] [although this is disputed]<sup><small>[[#Disappearance and alleged death|note]]</small></sup>), generally known as '''Netaji''' (lit. "Respected Leader"), was one of the most prominent and highly respected leaders of the [[Indian Independence Movement]] against the [[British Raj]]. 

Bose was elected president of the [[Indian National Congress]] for two consecutive terms but resigned from the post following ideological conflicts with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Bose believed that Mahatma Gandhi's tactics of non-violence would never be sufficient to secure India's independence, and advocated violent resistance. He established a separate political party, the [[All India Forward Bloc]] and continued to call for the full and immediate independence of India from British rule. He was imprisoned by the British authorities eleven times.

His stance did not change with the outbreak of the [[second world war]], which he saw as an opportunity to take advantage of British weakness. At the outset of the war, he fled India and travelled to the [[Soviet Union]], [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] seeking an alliance with the aim of attacking the British in India. With Japanese assistance he re-organised and later led the [[Indian National Army]], formed from Indian [[prisoner-of-war|prisoners-of-war]] and plantation workers from [[Malaya]], [[Singapore]] and other parts of [[Southeast Asia]], against British forces. With [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] monetary, political, diplomatic and military assistance, he formed the [[Azad Hind Government]] in exile, regrouped and led the [[Indian National Army]] to battle against the allies in [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] & [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] during the [[World War II]]

His political views and the alliances he made with Nazi and other militarist regimes opposed to the British Empire have been the cause of arguments among historians and politicians, with some accusing him of Fascist sympathies and of [[Quisling]]ist actions, while most others in India largely sympathetic towards his inculcation of [[realpolitik]] as a manifesto that guided his social and political choices. He is [[Death mystery of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose|believed to have died]] on [[18 August]], [[1945]] in a plane crash over [[Taiwan]].  However, contradictory evidence exists regarding his death in the accident.
 
== Early life ==
[[Image:Young Bose.gif|thumb|300px|right|Bose in his youth]]
Subhas Chandra Bose was born in 1897 to an affluent Bengali family in [[Cuttack]], [[Orissa]]. His father, Janakinath Bose, was a public prosecutor who believed in orthodox nationalism, and later became a member of the [[Bengal]] Legislative Council. Bose was educated at [[Ravenshaw College|Ravenshaw Collegiate School]], [[Cuttack]], [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]] and [[Fitzwilliam College]] at [[Cambridge University]].
In 1920, Bose took the [[Indian Civil Services]] entrance examination and was placed fourth with highest marks in English. However, he resigned from the prestigious Indian Civil Service in April 1921 despite his high ranking in the merit list, and went on to become an active member of India's independence movement. He joined the [[Indian National Congress]], and was particularly active in its youth wing. 

Still, Bose's ideals did not match those of Mahatma Gandhi's single belief in non-violence{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. He therefore returned to Calcutta to work under [[Chittaranjan Das]], the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] freedom fighter and co-founder (with [[Motilal Nehru]]) of the [[Swaraj Party]]. 

[[Image:netaji_at_calcutta.jpg|thumb|100|left|Subhash Chandra Bose]]

In 1921, Bose organised a boycott of the celebrations to mark the visit of the [[Prince of Wales]] to India, which led to his imprisonment. In April 1924, Bose was elected to the post of Chief Executive Officer of the newly constituted Calcutta Corporation, In October that year, Bose was arrested on suspicion of terrorism. At first, he was kept in [[Alipore Jail]] and later he was exiled to [[Mandalay]] in Burma (where earlier [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] had spent 6 years in prison). On [[January 23]], [[1930]], Bose was once again arrested for leading an "independence procession", protesting against British rule in India. After his release from jail on [[September 25]], he was elected as the [[Mayor]] of the City of Calcutta.

Over a span of 20 years, Bose was incarcerated eleven times by the British, either in India or in [[Rangoon]].  During the mid 1930s he was exiled by the British from India to Europe, where he championed India's cause and aspiration for self-rule before gatherings and conferences. 

After his father's death, the British authorities allowed him to land at Calcutta's airport only for the religious rites, which would be followed by his swift departure. He traveled extensively in India and in Europe before stating his political opposition to Gandhi. During his stay in Europe from 1933 to 1936, he met several European leaders and thinkers.He came to believe that India could achieve political freedom only if it had political, military and diplomatic support from outside, and that an independent nation necessitated the creation of a national army to secure its sovereignty. Subhash Chandra Bose married [[Emilie Schenkl]], an Austrian born national, who was his secretary, in 1937. According to Schenkl, she and Bose were secretly married in [[Bad Gastein]] on [[26 December]] [[1937]]. They had one daughter, [[Anita Bose Pfaff|Anita]], born in [[1942]]. Bose wrote many letters to Schenkl during the period 1934&ndash;1942, of which many have been published in the book ''Letters to Emilie Schenkl'', edited by Sisir Kumar Bose and Sugata Bose. 

[[Image:Bose AICC meeting 1939.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bose at AICC meeting in 1939]]

Bose became the president of the Haripura Indian National Congress in [[1938]], against Gandhi's wishes.  Gandhi  commented "Subhas' victory is my defeat" .  Gandhi's continued opposition led to the latter's resignation from the [[Working Committee]], and the possibility that the rest of the CWC would resign. In the face of this gesture of no-confidence, Bose himself resigned, and was left with no alternative but to form an independent party, the [[All India Forward Bloc]]. Bose also initiated the concept of the ''National Planning Committee'' in 1938.{{inote|'Subhas Chandra Bose', ''Itihaas'', <http://members.fortunecity.com/dikigoros/bose.htm> Retrieved [[May 24]] [[2005]]|itihass}}

== Actions during the Second World War ==
Bose advocated the approach that the political instability of war-time Britain should be taken advantage of—rather than simply wait for the British to grant independence after the end of the war (which was the view of Gandhi, Nehru and a section of the Congress leadership at the time). In this, he was influenced by the examples of Italian statesmen [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]. 

His correspondence reveals that despite his clear dislike …for British subjugation, he was deeply impressed by their methodical and systematic approach and their steadfastly disciplinarian outlook towards life. In England, he exchanged ideas on the future of India with [[British Labour Party]] leaders and political thinkers like [[Lord Halifax]], [[George Lansbury]], [[Clement Attlee]], [[Arthur Greenwood]], [[Harold Laski]], [[J.B.S. Haldane]], [[Ivor Jennings]], [[G.D.H. Cole]], [[Gilbert Murray]] and [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] . He came to believe that a free India needed Socialist authoritarianism, on the lines of [[Turkey]]'s [[Kemal Atatürk]], for at least two decades. Bose was refused permission by the British authorities to meet Mr. Ataturk at [[Ankara]] for political reasons. It should be noted that during his sojourn in England, only the Labour Party and Liberal politicians agreed to meet with Bose when he tried to schedule appointments. Conservative Party officials refused to meet Bose or show him the slightest courtesy due to the fact that he was a politician coming from a colony.  It may also be observed here that it was during the regime of the Labour Party (1945-1951), with Attlee as the Prime Minister, that India gained independence.  

==The Escape ==
[[Image:CarBose.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The car that Bose used during his escape]]
On the outbreak of war, Bose advocated a campaign of mass civil disobedience to protest against Viceroy [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Linlithgow]]'s decision to declare war on India's behalf without consulting the Congress leadership. Having failed to persuade Gandhi of the necessity of this, Bose organised mass protests in Calcutta calling for the 'Holwell Monument' commemorating the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]], which then stood at the corner of Dalhousie Square, to be removed{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. A reasonable measure of the contrast between Gandhi and Bose is captured in a saying attributable to him: "If people slap you once, slap them twice". He was thrown in jail by the British, but was released following a seven-day hunger strike. Bose's house in Calcutta was kept under surveillance by the CBI, but their vigilance left a good deal to be desired. With two court cases pending, he felt the British would not let him leave the country before the end of the war.  This set the scene for Bose's escape to [[Germany]], via [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Bose had never been to Afghanistan, and could not speak the local tribal language ([[Pashto]]). 

Bose escaped from under British surveillance at his house in [[Calcutta]]. On [[January 19]] [[1941]], accompanied by his nephew Sisir K. Bose, Bose gave his watchers the slip and journeyed to Peshawar. With the assistance of the [[Abwehr]], he made his way to [[Peshawar]]  where he was met at Peshawar Cantonment station by Akbar Shah, Mohammed Shah and Bhagat Ram Talwar. Bose was taken to the home of Abad Khan, a trusted friend of Akbar Shah's. On [[26 January]] [[1941]], Bose began his journey to reach Russia through India's North West frontier with [[Afghanistan]]. For this reason, he enlisted the help of Mian Akbar Shah, then a [[Forward Bloc]] leader in the [[North West Frontier Province]]. Shah had been out of India ''en route'' to the [[Soviet Union]], and suggested a novel disguise for Bose to assume. Since Bose could not speak one word of Pashto, it would make him an easy target of Pashto speakers working for the British. For this reason, Shah suggested that Bose act deaf and dumb, and let his beard grow to mimic those of the tribesmen.[[Image:Cancelledpassport of Bose.gif|thumb|200px|right|Cancelled passport of Bose]]

Supporters of the [[Aga Khan]] helped him across the border into Afghanistan where he was met by an Abwehr unit posing as a party of road construction engineers from the Organization Todt who then aided his passage across Afghanistan via Kabul to the border with Soviet Russia. Once in Russia the [[NKVD]] transported Bose to [[Moscow]] where he hoped that Russia's traditional enmity to British rule in India would result in support for his plans for a popular rising in India. However, Bose found the Soviets' response disappointing and was rapidly passed over to the German Ambassador in Moscow, [[Count von der Schulenburg]]. He had Bose flown on to [[Berlin]] in a special courier aircraft at the beginning of April where he was to receive a more favorable hearing from [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] and the Foreign Ministry officials at the [[Wilhelmstrasse]].<ref>Kurowski, The Brandenburgers - Global Mission, p. 136</ref>

===Assassination Attempts===

In [[1941]], when the British learned that Bose had sought the support of the [[Axis Powers]], they ordered their agents to intercept and assassinate Bose before he reached Germany. A recently declassified intelligence document refers to a top-secret instruction to the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) of British intelligence to murder Bose.
In fact, the plan to liquidate Bose has few parallels, and appears to be a last desperate measure against a man who had thrown the [[British Empire]] into a panic.<ref>Bhaumik S, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4152320.stm ''British "attempted to kill Bose"''] BBC news. 15 August 2005. URL accessed on 6 April 2006</ref>

=== In Germany ===
{{Seealso|Legion Freies Indien|Azad Hind Radio}}
[[Image:Bose and Rommel.jpg|thumb|200px|Bose and a [[Wehrmacht]] officer.]]Having escaped incarceration at home by assuming the guise of a [[Pashtun]] insurance agent ("Ziaudddin") to reach [[Afghanistan]], Bose traveled to [[Moscow]] on the passport of an Italian nobleman "Count Orlando Mazzotta". From Moscow, he reached [[Rome]], and from there he traveled to [[Germany]], where he instituted the [[Special Bureau for India]] under [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]], broadcasting on the German-sponsored [[Azad Hind Radio]]. He founded the ''Free India Centre'' in Berlin, and created the [[Indian Legion]] (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by [[Axis Powers|Axis]] forces. The [[Indian Legion]] was attached to the [[Wehrmacht]], and later transferred to the [[Waffen SS]];<ref>Rudolf Hartog ''The Sign of the Tiger'' (Delhi: Rupa) 2001 pp159-60 </ref> its members swore their allegiance to both Hitler and Bose to secure India's independence. He was also, however, prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the U.S.S.R. by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion; many have questioned his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War.<ref>Sen, S. 1999. [http://web.archive.org/web/20050305012751/http://www.andaman.org/book/app-m/textm.htm Subhas Chandra Bose 1897-1945]. From [http://www.archive.org/ webarchive] of [http://www.andaman.org/book/app-m/textm.htm this URL]. URL accessed on 7 April, 2006.</ref>

The lack of interest shown by Hitler in the cause of Indian independence eventually caused Bose to become disillusioned with [[Hitler]] and he decided to leave [[Nazi Germany]] in 1943. Bose had been living together with his wife Schenkl in [[Berlin]] from 1941 until [[1943]], when he left for south-east Asia. He travelled by the German submarine [[Unterseeboot 180|''U-180'']] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to Imperial [[Japan]] (via Japanese submarine [[Japanese submarine I-29|''I-29'']]). Thereafter the Japanese helped him raise his army in [[Singapore]]. This was the only civilian transfer across two submarines of two different navies in World War II.

===Indian National Army===
{{Main|Indian National Army}}
{{Seealso|Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind|Mohan Singh Deb|Rash Behari Bose}} [[Image:Subhas Bose.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bose as the leader of [[INA]]]]
The [[Indian National Army]] (INA) was originally founded by [[Mohan Singh Deb|Capt Mohan Singh]] in [[Singapore]] in [[September]] [[1942]] with Japan's Indian [[POW]]s in the Far East. This was along the concept of- and with support of- what was then known as the [[Indian Independence League]],headed by expatriate nationalist leader [[Rash Behari Bose]]. The first INA was however disbanded in December 1942 after disagreements between the [[Hikari Kikan]] and Mohan singh, who came to believe that the Japanese High Command was using the INA as a mere pawn and Propaganda tool. Mohan Singh was taken into custody and the troops returned to the Prisoner-of-War camp. However, the idea of a liberation army was revived with the arrival of Subhas Chandra Bose in the Far East in 1943. In July, at a meeting in Singapore, Rash Behari Bose handed over control of the organisation to  Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose was able to reorganise the fledging army and organise massive support among the expatriate Indian population in south-east Asia, who lent their support by both enlisting in the Indian National Army, as well as financially in response Bose's calls for sacrfice for the national cause. At its height it consisted of some 85,000{{Fact|date=March 2007}} regular troops, including a separate women's unit, the [[Rani of Jhansi Regiment]] ( named after [[Rani Lakshmi Bai]]), which is seen as a first of its kind in Asia.

[[Image:netaji_reviewing_troops.jpg|thumb|100|left|Netaji reviewing INA troops in Singapore after formally taking command]]

Even when faced with military reverses, Bose was able to maintain support for the [[Azad Hind]] movement. Spoken as a part of a motivational speech for the Indian National Army at a rally of Indians in Burma on [[July 4]] [[1944]], Bose's most famous quote was "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!" . In this, he urged the people of India to join him in his fight against the British Raj. Spoken in Hindi, Bose's words are highly evocative. 
The troops of the INA were under the aegis of a provisional government, the [[Azad Hind Government]], which came to produce its own currency, court and civil code, and was recognised by nine [[Axis Powers|Axis]] states—[[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Italy]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]], [[Wang Jingwei Government|Wang Jingwei's Government in Nanjing]], [[Thailand]], a provisional government of [[Burma]], [[Manchukuo]] and Japanese-controlled [[Philippines]]. Recent researches have shown that the USSR too had recognised the "[[Provisional Government of Free India]]". Of those countries, five were authorities established under Axis occupation. This government participated as a delegate or observer in the so-called [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].

The INA's first commitment was in the Japanese thrust towards Eastern Indian frontiers of Manipur. INA's [[Bahadur Group|special forces]], the [[Bahadur Group]], were extensively involved in operations behind enemy lines both during the diversionary attacks in Arakan, as well as the Japanese thrust towards Imphal and Kohima, along with the Burmese National Army led by [[Ba Maw]] and [[Aung San]]. A year after the [[Invasion and Occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II|islands were taken by the Japanese]], the Provisional Government and the INA were established in the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]] with Lt Col. A.D Loganthan appointed its Governor General. The islands were renamed ''Shaheed'' (Martyr) and ''Swaraj'' (Self-rule). However, the Japanese Navy remained in essential control of the island's administration. During Bose's only visit to the islands in late in 1943, when he was carefully screened from the local population by the Japanese authorities, who at that time were torturing the leader of the Indian Independence League on the Islands, Dr. Diwan Singh (who later died of his injuries, in the [[Cellular Jail]]). The islanders made several attempts to alert Bose to their plight, but apparently without success.<ref>N. Iqbal Singh ''The Andaman Story'' (Delhi: Vikas Publ.) 1978 p249; Jayant Dasgupta ''Japanese in Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Red Sun over Black Water'' (Delhi: Manas Publications) 2002 pp67, 73-5. <blockquote> With reference to this it is interesting to note that during the 1970s the leader of the Communist Party in the Lok Sabha, Samar Guha, proposed renaming the Islands once again as ''Shaheed'' and ''Swaraj'', as Bose would have wanted. This was strongly opposed by K.R. Ganesh, a Minister in Indira Gandhi's Government, and the one prominent Indian politician to have hailed from the Andamans, on the grounds that Bose had failed the people of the islands in 1943. When asked in debate by Guha whether atrocities had been committed before or after Bose's visit, Ganesh replied "Before, during and after"</blockquote> Dasgupta ''Red Sun over Black Water'' p77 </ref> Enraged with the lack of administrative control, Lt. Col Loganathan later relinquished his authority to return to the Government's head quarters in Rangoon. 

On the Indian mainland, an Indian Tricolour, modeled after that of the Indian National Congress, was raised for the first time in the town in [[Moirang]], in [[Manipur]], in northeastern India. The towns of [[Kohima]] and [[Imphal]] were placed under siege by divisions of the Japanese, Burmese and the ''Gandhi'' and ''Nehru'' Brigades of I.N.A. during the attempted invasion of India, also known as Operation U-GO. However, Commonwealth forces held both positions and then counter-attacked, in the process inflicting serious losses on the besieging forces, which were then forced to retreat back into Burma.



Bose had hoped that large numbers of soldiers would desert from the Indian Army when they would discover that INA soldiers were attacking British India from the outside.<ref> Bose, Subhas Chandra. [http://www.tamilnation.org/ideology/bose.htm#Atlee%20quick%20to%20understand%20implications Speech at a mass rally, Singapore, 9 July 1943]. ''Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose & India's Independence''. Tanilnation.org. URL accessed on 7 April 2006</ref> However, this did not materialise on a sufficient scale. Instead, as the war situation worsened for the Japanese, troops began to desert from the INA. At the same time Japanese funding for the army diminished, and Bose was forced to raise taxes on the Indian populations of Malaysia and Singapore, sometimes extracting money by force.<ref>Toye, H. "The Springing Tiger", pp. 112, 113, 115. Collected from Montgomery, A. [http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v14/v14_Montgomery.html ''Subhas Chandra...'']. JHR.</ref> When the Japanese were defeated at the battles of [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]] and [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]], the Provisional Government's aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost forever. The INA was forced to pull back, along with the retreating Japanese army, and fought in key battles against the [[British Indian Army]] in its [[Burma campaign]], notable in Meiktilla, Mandalay, Pegu, Nyangyu and Mount Popa. However, with the fall of Rangoon, Bose's government ceased be an effective political entitiy. A large proportion of the INA troops surrendered under [[A. D Loganathan|Lt Col Loganathan]] when Rangoon fell. The remaining troops retreated with Bose towards Malaya or made for Thailand. Japan's surrender at the end of the war also led to the eventual surrender of the [[Indian National Army]], when the troops of the British Indian Army were repatriated to India and some tried for treason...

His other famous quote was, "Delhi chalo", meaning "On to Delhi!". This was the call he used to give the INA armies to motivate them. "[[Jai Hind]]", or, "Glory to India!" was another slogan used by him and later adopted by the Government of India and the [[Indian Armed Forces]].

== Disappearance and alleged death ==
{{main|Death of Subhash Chandra Bose}}
Officially, Bose died in a plane crash over [[Taiwan]], while flying to [[Tokyo]] on [[18 August]] [[1945]]. However, his body was never recovered, and many theories have been put forward concerning his possible survival. One such claim is that Bose actually died in [[Siberia]], while in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] captivity. Several committees have been set up by the Government of India to probe into this matter.

In May 1956, a four-man Indian team (known as the Shah Nawaz Committee) visited [[Japan]] to probe the circumstances of Bose's alleged death. The Indian government did not then request assistance from the government of [[Taiwan]] in the matter, citing their lack of diplomatic relations with Taiwan. 

However, the Inquiry Commission under [[Mukherjee Commission|Justice Mukherjee]], which investigated the Bose disappearance mystery in the period 1999-2005, did approach the Taiwanese government and obtained information from the Taiwan Government that no plane carrying Bose had ever crashed in Taipei.<ref>[http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=277465 '''No crash at Taipei that killed Netaji: Taiwan govt.''' Outlook India]</ref> The Mukherjee Commission also received a report originating from the US State Department, supporting the claim of the Taiwan Government that no such air crash took place during that time frame.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1236063.cms '''Netaji case: US backs Taiwan govt.''' Times of India. 19 Sep, 2005]</ref>

The Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Indian Government on November 8, 2005. The report was tabled in Parliament on May 17, 2006. The probe said in its report that Bose did not die in the plane crash and the ashes at Renkoji temple are not his. However, the Indian Government rejected the findings of the Commission.

==Political views==
{{main|Political Views of Subhash Chandra Bose}}

Bose's earlier correspondence (prior to 1939) also reflects his deep disapproval of the racist practices of, and annulment of democratic institutions in Nazi Germany.<ref> Bose to Dr. Thierfelder of the ''Deutsche Academie'', Kurhaus Hochland, Badgastein, 25th March 1936 "Today I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish but arrogant." ''The Essential Writings of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose'' Edited by Sisir K. Bose & Sugata Bose (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1997 p155</ref> He also, however, expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods (though not the racial ideologies) which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s, and thought they could be used in building an independent India.<ref>Sen, S. 1999. [http://web.archive.org/web/20050305012751/http://www.andaman.org/book/app-m/textm.htm Subhas Chandra Bose 1897-1945]. From [http://www.archive.org/ webarchive] of [http://www.andaman.org/book/app-m/textm.htm this URL].</ref>

[[Image:Netaji_with_gandhi.gif|thumb|150|left|Netaji Subhas with Gandhi. Netaji disapproved of the pacifist ideology promoted by Gandhi and wanted congress to be strong in its approach towards total Independence from British rule.]]

Bose has been branded as a [[fascist]] in some quarters. Others believe that Bose had clearly expressed his belief that democracy was the best option for India.<ref>Roy, Dr. R.C. 2004. [http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jan2004/englishpdf/chapter1.pdf ''Social, Economic and Political Philosophy of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose'']. pp.7-8. Orissa Review. URL accessed on 6 April 2006</ref> The pro-Bose thinkers believe that his authoritarian control of the [[Azad Hind]] was based on political pragmatism and a post-colonial recovery doctrine rather than any anti-democratic belief.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. However, during the war (and possibly as early as the 1930s) Bose seems to have decided that no democratic system could be adequate to overcome India's poverty and social inequalities, and he wrote that an authoritarian state, similar to that of [[Soviet Russia]] (which he had also seen and admired) would be needed for the process of national re-building.<ref> "The Fundamental Problems of India" (An address to the Faculty and students of Tokyo University, November 1944): "You cannot have a so-called democratic system, if that system has to put through economic reforms on a socialistic basis. Therefore we must have a political system - a State - of an authoritarian character. We have had some experience of democratic institutions in India and we have also studied the working of democratic institutions in countries like France, England and United States of America. And we have come to the conclusion that with a democratic system we cannot solve the problems of Free India. Therefore, modern progressive thought in India is in favour of a State of an authoritarian character" ''The Essential Writings of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose'' Edited by Sisir K. Bose & Sugata Bose (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1997 pp319-20 </ref> Accordingly some suggest that Bose's alliance with the Axis during the war was based on more than just pragmatism, and that Bose may have been a [[Fascist]], though not a [[Nazi]]; alternatively, others consider he might have been using populist methods of mobilization common to many postcolonial leaders.
<ref>Sen, S. 1999. [http://web.archive.org/web/20050305012751/http://www.andaman.org/book/app-m/textm.htm Subhas Chandra Bose 1897-1945]. From [http://www.archive.org/ webarchive] of [http://www.andaman.org/book/app-m/textm.htm this URL].</ref><br />

After the Independence of India, Subhas Chandra Bose did not get much importance, as the Gandhi-influenced Congress Party came to rule.
