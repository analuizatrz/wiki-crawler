{{nihongo |'''''Madlax''''' |マドラックス |Madorakkusu}} is a 26-episode Japanese [[anime]] [[television series]] produced in 2004 by the [[Bee Train]] animation studio. [[Kōichi Mashimo]] directed ''Madlax'' and the [[soundtrack]] was composed by [[Yuki Kajiura]]. The [[DVD]] version was released by [[ADV Films]] in North America and the United Kingdom and by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia and New Zealand.

The story revolves around two young women who seemingly have little in common and do not know of the other's existence at the beginning. The titular Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional [[civil war]]-torn country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago, when the war started. The other protagonist is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who lead the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret, however, mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own, [[retrograde amnesia|losing her memories]] prior to her return; the only thing she recalls is a single word, "Madlax". With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful [[crime syndicate]] Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them.

''Madlax'' was produced as a [[spiritual successor]] to the studio's earlier project, ''[[Noir (anime)|Noir]]'', and together with ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', these series constitute a [[trilogy]] exploring the "[[girls with guns|girls-with-guns]]" genre. The production of ''Madlax'' began in 2002 but it wasn’t until [[Yōsuke Kuroda]] joined the project that the series took its final form. While the critics noted the resulting similarities between ''Noir'' and ''Madlax'', they also acknowledged the differences, such as the latter's less episodic and more plot-driven style and, in particular contrast to the predominantly [[realism (arts)|realistic]] ''Noir'', incorporation of many [[fictional setting of Madlax|supernatural elements]], which the audience must often interpret without further explanation.

Enfant's top operative, [[Carrossea Doon]], tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction, towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble for some time. Meanwhile, [[Vanessa Rene]], Margaret's former tutor whose parents died because of Gazth-Sonikan war,<ref name="ep13_VPar">'''Vanessa:''' "My father was a diplomat in Nafrece, you see, and at the time that the threat of civil war here was coming to a peak, he was in charge of relations with Gazth-Sonika. Then the civil war broke out, and my parents were detained by the Gazth-Sonika army under suspicion of inciting the war". {{cite episode|title=Awakening Sound ~awake~|series=Madlax|credits= |network=[[TV Tokyo]]|airdate=2004-06-28|number=13|minutes=8:21}}</ref> discovers that her current employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the war by supplying both sides with firearms and starts investigating its true cause. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is assigned as her [[bodyguard]], and together, they uncover data that proves that Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict. Enfant intercepts and forces them into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to help Vanessa and travels to Gazth-Sonika, accompanied by both her devoted and sometimes overprotective [[maid]] [[Elenore Baker]] and Carrossea Doon.

Eventually, Madlax and Margaret meet and embark on a search for [[List of Madlax characters#Quanzitta Marison |Quanzitta Marison]], a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who supposedly knows about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader [[Friday Monday]] possesses [[supernatural]] powers connected to the [[Fictional setting of Madlax#Holy Books |three ancient books]], one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.

[[Image:Laetitia, Margaret and Madlax.jpg|thumb|Unable to shoot her father in self-defence, Margaret expelled her wish to survive from herself, creating Madlax, who pulled the trigger for her. Laetitia was created to seal off the memory of this event, preventing the two from merging.<ref name="ep25_personae">{{cite episode|title=Holy Blood ~saint~|series=Madlax|credits= |network=[[TV Tokyo]]|airdate=2004-09-20|number=25|minutes=14:36}}</ref>]]

While Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by Limelda Jorg, a Gazth-Sonikan [[sniper]] who becomes her [[arch-nemesis]] throughout the show. Limelda kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into [[clinical depression]]. Elenore and Lady Quanzitta's servant [[List of Madlax characters#Nakhl |Nakhl]] manage to restore Madlax's will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant's headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday's control, shoots Madlax. Believing her to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people's inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret's memories return and she snaps out of his [[mind control]]. Only now does the audience learn the [[back-story]]: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret's father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own parent. To escape the horrible truth of her [[patricide]], Margaret split herself into three personae: the "memory keeper" [[List of Madlax characters#Laetitia |Laetitia]], the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. After the revelation, Madlax reappears and guns down Monday, followed by Margaret fusing her three personae to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Afterwards, she once again splits herself in three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae.

''Madlax'' also plays as the story of Margaret Burton's search for her [[psychological identity]].<ref name="ST5">{{cite DVD-notes |title=[http://www.advfilms.com/product.aspx?ProductId=19300 Madlax Volume 3: The In-Between] |titleyear=2004 |director=[[Kōichi Mashimo]] |format=insert leaflet ''Staff Talk #5 (Yuki Kajiura)'' |publisher=[[ADV Films]] |location=[[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]] |publisherid=DMAD/003 |year=2005}}</ref> Based on the Mashimo Menu theme titles available to her, Yuki Kajiura has suggested an interpretation that while searching for her memories, Margaret meets the other characters ("Gatekeepers") one after another and learns about the lifestyles ("Gates") they represent.

== Production ==
=== Writing ===
According to the director Kōichi Mashimo, he envisioned ''Noir'' and ''Madlax'' as part of a trilogy exploring the [[girls with guns|girls-with-guns]] genre, and soon after the release of the latter, he confirmed having plans to produce the third installment,<ref name="Wong" /> which would later become ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]''.<ref name="NTUSA_Apr07">{{cite journal|title=Interview with Kōichi Mashimo|quotes=no|journal=[[Newtype USA]]|year=2007|volume=7|issue=4|month=April|quote=During an interview, I accidentally blurted out something about [''Noir'' and ''Madlax'' being part of] a 'trilogy', which forced me to follow through and actually make a third installment!}}</ref> In late 2002, Mashimo invited [[Shigeru Kitayama]], the producer of ''Noir'' who once came up with its original idea, to discuss a new series entitled ''Madlax''. Kitayama greatly expanded Mashimo's original [[screenplay]] plan, but it was not until [[Yōsuke Kuroda]] was put in charge of the script that the series took its final appearance. It took Kuroda around one year to finish the screenplays for all 26 episodes, during which he was constantly encouraged by Mashimo to add his own original ideas to their initial plan. Kuroda has admitted that at the time he received Mashimo's invitation, he felt frustrated after his first project has been canceled by the publisher, so he decided to make ''Madlax'' "really extravagant", blending as many genres at once as he could. Kōichi Mashimo, furthermore, admitted that the most unusual [[plot twist]]s, like Margaret and Madlax's connection to each other, were invented by Kuroda and him while [[alcohol intoxication|drunk]].<ref name="Wong" />

=== Character design ===
By comparison with ''Noir'', ''Madlax'' features a much larger primary cast, including multiple recurring male [[fictional character|character]]s, an element nearly absent in the former. It was not so in the original screenplay draft written by Mashimo and Kitayama: for example, "Madlax" was Margaret's own nickname and [[List of Madlax characters#Charlie |Charlie]] (Vanessa's colleague at Bookwald Industries) had one of the central roles similar to Speedy's in ''[[Avenger (anime)|Avenger]]''. Only the "draft" characters' names remained of them when Kuroda has rewritten the script. A total of three [[character design]]ers collaborated on ''Madlax'' cast: [[Satoshi Ohsawa]] (who also worked on ''Noir'' cast) created the central heroines Margaret and Madlax; Minako Shiba drew Friday Monday and Carrossea Doon; and Satoko Miyachi was entrusted with the "mysterious" characters, Laetitia and Poupee.<ref name="ST12">{{cite DVD-notes |title=[http://www.advfilms.com/product.aspx?ProductId=19298 Madlax Volume 1: Connections] |titleyear=2004 |director=[[Kōichi Mashimo]] |format=insert leaflets ''Staff Talk #1 (Shigeru Kitayama)'' and ''#2 (Yosuke{{sic}} Kuroda)'' |publisher=[[ADV Films]] |location=[[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]] |publisherid=DMAD/001 |year=2005}}</ref><ref name="ST4">{{cite DVD-notes |title=[http://www.advfilms.com/product.aspx?ProductId=19299 Madlax Volume 2: The Red Book] |titleyear=2004 |director=[[Kōichi Mashimo]] |format=insert leaflet ''Staff Talk #4 (Minako Shiba and Satoko Miyachi)'' |publisher=[[ADV Films]] |location=[[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]] |publisherid=DMAD/002 |year=2005}}</ref><!-- This entire subsection was extracted from the DVD inserts. -->

Several [[seiyū]]s who voiced characters in ''Madlax'' have participated in earlier projects by studio Bee Train, for example, [[Houko Kuwashima]] and [[Aya Hisakawa]] who played [[Kirika Yuumura]] and [[Chloe (Noir)|Chloe]] in ''Noir'' also voiced Margaret Burton and Limelda Jorg.<ref name="ANN_Kuwashima">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=281 |title=Houko Kuwashima |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2006-11-09}}</ref><ref name="ANN_Hisakawa">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=503 |title=Aya Hisakawa |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2006-11-09}}</ref> [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] ([[Mireille Bouquet]] in ''Noir''), on the other hand, has received only a minor role (Margaret's mother in episode 21),<ref name="ANN_Mitsuishi">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=720 |title=Kotono Mitsuishi |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2006-11-09}}</ref> while the titular lead of ''Madlax'' was voiced by [[Sanae Kobayashi]], previously involved with ''[[.hack//Liminality]]'' (Mai Minase).<ref name="ANN_Kobayashi">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=720 |title=Sanae Kobayashi |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2006-11-09}}</ref> [[Masashi Ebara]] (Friday Monday) also had a major role in ''Liminality'' (Junichiro Tokuoka).<ref name="ANN_Ebara">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=510 |title=Masashi Ebara |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2006-11-09}}</ref> [[Monica Rial]] (Kirika Yuumura in the English translation of ''Noir'') worked on the translation of the screenplay for the ADV Films release.<ref name="ANN_Rial">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3714 |title=Monica Rial |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2006-11-09}}</ref>

=== Music ===
Like with many of studio Bee Train's other works, the entire ''Madlax'' soundtrack was composed by the acclaimed Yuki Kajiura, making it her and Kōichi Mashimo's fifth project together.<ref name = "OST1_int"/> In an interview Kajiura recalls having written the score in a hotel high-rise to save studio costs, and that this change in location helped her to explore different styles of music.<ref name="OST1_int">{{cite album-notes |title=Madlax OST I |bandname=[[Yuki Kajiura]] |notestitle=Yuki Kajiura's interview with Keiichi Nozaki and Satoko Miyachi |format=CD booklet |publisher=[[Geneon]] |publisherid=VICL-61319 |mbid=0b356f1d-a9f7-413a-b4ce-87fe197ec778}}</ref>

Kajiura and [[Yuuka Nanri]]'s duo [[FictionJunction YUUKA]] recorded the series' opening and ending themes, {{nihongo |"Fragments of an Eye" |瞳の欠片 |Hitomi no Kakera}} and "inside your heart", respectively, as well as two insert songs: "nowhere" and "I'm here". Aside from the opening sequence, "Fragments of an Eye" is featured in the series itself: at the end of episode 18 and in the episode 24, when Margaret is humming its tune to herself in the flower field.<ref name="ANN_triv">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3714&page=22|title=''Madlax'' (TV) Trivia|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>

In the insert song "nowhere", there is a frequently repeated background [[refrain]] {{nihongo |"Yanmaani" |ヤンマーニ |Yanmāni}}. It doesn't have any particular meaning but since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, "Yanmaani" has become something of a joke to Japanese fans, claiming that it apparently gives her [[superpower (ability)|superpower]]s.<ref name="ST3">{{cite DVD-notes |title=[http://www.advfilms.com/product.aspx?ProductId=19299 Madlax Volume 2: The Red Book] |titleyear=2004 |director=[[Kōichi Mashimo]] |format=insert leaflet ''Staff Talk #3 (Satoshi Osawa{{sic}})'' |publisher=[[ADV Films]] |location=[[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]] |publisherid=DMAD/002 |year=2005}}</ref>

Since the word "[[Bible]]" is derived from {{lang-grc |"τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια"}}, meaning "holy books", it is likely that the artbook's title is a reference to the [[Fictional setting of Madlax#Holy Books |Holy Books]] that play an important role in the series' plot.

== Reception ==
''Madlax'' was often accused of being secondary and reusing ''[[Noir (anime)|Noir]]'''s stylistic solutions, such as the story [[premise (film)|premise]], the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style.<ref name="ANN_V1_rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/madlax/dvd-1 |title=''Madlax'' DVD #1 review |accessdate=2006-11-08 |author=Martin, Theron |date=2005-05-06 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref> Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and [[subplot]]s being tightly intertwined and held together by the [[A-Plot|primary plot]].<ref name="Mania_V7_rev" /><ref name="DV_V2_rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol2.php |title=''Madlax'' DVD #2 review |accessdate=2006-11-08 |author=Hattaway, Mitchell |date=2005-09-01 |publisher=DVDVerdict.com |quote=...every new twist only strengthens the plot. Yes, the story is quite complex, but it doesn't appear to be complex just for the sake of being complex. The plot is a big puzzle, but I have a feeling all of the pieces will eventually fall into place.}}</ref> 

The majority of reviewers perceived the early episodes of ''Madlax'' as boring and too slow-paced,<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /> but some of the same critics later remarked that the prolonged [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] is crucial to the unusual [[Series finale|finale]] of the series, which fully establishes the series' own identity and sets it apart from other works.<ref name="DVDTalk_rev" /><ref name="Mania_V7_rev" /><ref name="ANN_V67_rev" /><ref name="DV_V6_rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol6.php |title=''Madlax'' DVD #6 review |accessdate=2006-11-08 |author=Hattaway, Mitchell |date=2006-02-07]] |publisher=DVDVerdict.com |quote=Sure, at first glance ''Madlax'' appears to be nothing more than another run-of-the-mill girls-with-guns anime, but this series goes a long way to proving that the devil's in the details. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> Unless they really blow things at the end, this will go down as one terrific series.}}</ref> According to them, after the initial volume, the story gets better and better with every new episode,<ref name="Mania_V4_rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/madlax-vol-4_article_78358.html |title=''Madlax'' DVD #4 review |accessdate=2008-09-22 |author=Morton, Bryan |date=2006-09-28 |publisher=Mania.com}}</ref><ref name="DV_V3_rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol3.php |title=''Madlax'' DVD #3 review |accessdate=2006-11-08 |author=Hattaway, Mitchell |date=2005-09-15 |publisher=DVDVerdict.com |quote=This series keeps getting better and better. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> I keep waiting for ''Madlax'' to implode, but it somehow manages to keep on chugging along.}}</ref> though some have been dissatisfied with its "pseudo-[[existentialism|existentialistic]]" ending.<ref name="DV_V7_rev" /> Erica Friedman, the president of [[Yuricon]], highly praised Kuroda's script, naming it "the best writing that Bee Train has done".<ref name="EF_V7_rev">{{cite web |url=http://okazu.blogspot.com/2006/07/yuri-anime-madlax-volume-7.html |title=''Madlax'' DVD #7 review |accessdate=2007-10-25 |author=Friedman, Erica |date=2007-07-03 |quote=It's a magic with no roots in our world, so we have to take everything we're given at face value,.. [...] I still maintain that ''Madlax'' is the best writing that Bee Train has done. It has the mystery of the ''.hack'' series, without the endless meaningless chatter that goes nowhere, the yuri and violence of ''Noir'', the despair and love of ''Avenger'' and a story that resolves, unlike all of them.}}</ref> Professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters,<ref name="Mania_V6_rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/madlax-vol-6_article_77932.html |title=''Madlax'' DVD #6 review |accessdate=2008-09-22 |author=Beveridge, Chris |date=2006-01-26 |publisher=Mania.com}}</ref> especially the distinguishable male ones (Friday, Carrossea, Colonel Burton), as opposed to [[stormtrooper effect|stormtrooper]]-like operatives of Soldats in ''Noir'',<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /> but the female character designs were still said to be much more detailed (to the point of [[fanservice]] in case of Madlax) than the more generic male characters.<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" />

The high quality of the [[animation]] in ''Madlax'' was generally acknowledged.<ref name="Mania_V7_rev" /><ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> On the negative side, the episodes that involve [[computer]] use and [[computer crime|hacking]] received criticism for their lack of realism.<ref name="Mania_V3_rev" /> In terms of soundtrack, ''Madlax'' has not become as innovative as ''Noir'',<ref name="AA_OST1_rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.activeanime.com/pn/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2343 |title=''Madlax OST I'' review |accessdate=2007-07-27 | |author=Salandanan, Rommel |date=2005-11-14 |publisher=ActiveAnime.com}}</ref> with critics suggesting its OST to be a blend of ''Noir'' and ''[[.hack//Sign]]'' styles.<ref name="ANN_V2_rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/madlax/dvd-2 |title=''Madlax'' DVD #2 review |accessdate=2006-11-08 |author=Martin, Theron |date=2005-06-28 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |quote=The musical scoring, which sounds like a mix of ''Noir'' and ''.hack//SIGN''{{sic}},..}}</ref> Nevertheless, the reviewers acknowledged its superiority over the majority of contemporary works.<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /><ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> The English translation released by ADV Films was praised for preserving most of the series' original stylistic aspects and inviting veteran voice actors for the dub.<ref name="Mania_V4_rev" /> Reviewers went as far as to suggest that several English voices (especially [[Mike Kleinhenz]]'s) match the characters better than the Japanese ones.<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" />

The initial slow pacing, especially compared to the first episodes of ''Noir'',<ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> became a main reason why the audience often dropped watching ''Madlax'' before it could present its later story turns which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series.<ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> Among other suggested reasons behind the mediocre popularity of the show were: the [[market saturation]], which resulted from other anime series attempting to repeat the success of ''Noir'' since 2001; the expectable disinterest against a "''Noir'' [[remake]]", found among the fans of the first series;<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /> the over-the-top action scenes that some felt to be ridiculous;<ref name="THEM_rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=817 |title=''Madlax'' (first two episodes) review |accessdate=2007-01-10 |author=Ross, Carlos |publisher=THEM Anime Reviews |quote=Usually, a show like this is saved by its dramatic themes and its action sequences. Noir was. Madlax is not... The "action" is so over-the-top as to cross the line between cool and stupid... Maybe future episodes will prove me wrong, but for now, ''Madlax'' is frustratingly mediocre and extremely difficult to find the motivation to continue.}}</ref> and its unconventional genre, which straddled ''Madlax'' uncomfortably between fans of mystical [[science fiction]] and those who prefer ''Noir''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s strict realism.<ref name="Mania_V6_rev" />
