The '''political history of medieval Karnataka''' spans the 4th to the 16th centuries, when the empires that evolved in the [[Karnataka]] region of [[India]] made a lasting impact on the subcontinent. Before this, alien empires held sway over the region, and the nucleus of power was outside modern Karnataka. The medieval era can be broadly divided into several periods. The earliest native kingdoms and imperialism; the successful domination of the Gangetic plains in northern India and rivalry with the empires of [[Tamilakam]] over the [[Vengi]] region; and the domination of the southern Deccan and consolidation against Muslim invasion. The origins of the rise of the Karnataka region as an independent power date back to the fourth-century birth of the [[Kadamba Dynasty]] of [[Banavasi]], the earliest of the native rulers to conduct administration in the native language of [[Kannada]] in addition to the official [[Sanskrit]]. This is the historical starting point in studying the development of the region as an enduring geopolitical entity and of Kannada as an important regional language.

In the southern regions of Karnataka, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Western Gangas]] of [[Talakad]] were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas and Gangas were followed by the imperial dynasties of the [[Badami Chalukyas]], the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]], the [[Western Chalukya Empire]], the [[Hoysala Empire]] and the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], all patronising the ancient Indic religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from the west of the subcontinent. The Muslim invasion of the Deccan resulted in the breaking away of the feudatory Sultanates in the 14th century. The rule of the [[Bahamani Sultanate]] of [[Bidar]] and the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] from the northern Deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. The hereditary ruling families and clans ably served the large empires and upheld the local culture and traditions. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 brought about a slow disintegration of Kannada-speaking regions into minor kingdoms that struggled to maintain autonomy in an age dominated by foreigners until unification and independence in 1947.

Prior to and during the early centuries of the first millennium, large areas of the Karnataka region was ruled by such imperial powers as the [[Mauryas]] of Maghada and later the [[Satavahanas]], empires whose centres of power were in the Gangetic plains and Central India respectively. With the weakening of the Satavahanas, the Pallavas of Kanchi took control for a brief duration.<ref name="pal">Ramesh (1984), pp1–3</ref> In the 4th century, the rise to power of the [[Kadamba Dynasty]] of [[Banavasi]] identified the Karnataka region as  an independent political entity and Kannada as an administrative language from the middle of 5th century.<ref name="first">From the Halmidi inscription (Ramesh 1984, pp10–11)</ref> The Kadambas were natives of the Talagunda region (in modern [[Shivamogga district]]) as proven by inscriptions.<ref name="first1">The Kadambas were Kanarese speaking dravidians inducted into the Brahmin fold (Moraes 1931, p11)</ref><ref name="first2">Their local tribal origins is attested by the Talagunda inscription, R.N.

Historians view this act as one of assertion by the Kadambas who considered themselves equal to the imperial Gupta dynasty.<ref name="equal">Moraes, Desai and Panchamukhi in Kamath (2001), p33</ref> 

Family feuds and conflicts ended the Kadamba rule in the middle of 6th century when the last Kadamba ruler Krishna Varma II was subdued by [[Pulakesi I]] of the Chalukya feudatory, ending their sovereign rule. The Kadambas would continue to rule parts of Karnataka and Goa for many centuries to come but never again as an independent kingdom.<ref name="sov">Kamath (2001), p35</ref> Some historians view the Kadambas as the originators of the Karnataka architectural tradition although there were elements in common with the structures  built by the contemporaneous Pallavas of Kanchi.<ref name="tradition">Moraes in Kamath (2001), p37</ref> The oldest surviving Kadamba structure is one dating to late 5th century in [[Halsi]] in modern [[Belgaum district]].

The [[Western Ganga Dynasty]], contemporaries of the Kadambas, came to power from [[Kolar]] but in the late 4th century - early 5th century moved their capital to [[Talakad]] in modern [[Mysore district]].<ref name="my">Kamath (2001), p40</ref> They ruled the region historically known as Gangavadi comprising most of the modern southern districts of Karnataka.

The [[Chalukya dynasty]], natives of the [[Aihole]] and [[Badami]] region in Karnataka, were at first a feudatory of the Kadambas.<ref name="natives">N. Laxminarayana Rao and S. C. Nandinath in Kamath 2001, p57</ref><ref name="natives1">Keay (2000), p168</ref>

During the rule of [[Pulakesi II]]  a south Indian empire sent expeditions to the north past the [[Tapti River]] and [[Narmada River]] for the first time and successfully defied Harshavardhana, the King of Northern India (''Uttarapatheswara''). The [[Aihole]] inscription of Pulakesi II, written in classical Sanskrit language and old Kannada script dated 634,<ref name="mix">In this composition, the poet deems himself an equal to Sanskrit scholars of lore like Bharavi and Kalidasa (Sastri 1955, p312</ref><ref name="mix1">Kamath (2001), p59</ref> proclaims his victories against the Kingdoms of Kadambas, Western Gangas, [[Alupas]] of South Canara, Mauryas of [[Puri]], Kingdom of [[Kaushal|Kosala]], [[Malwa]], [[Gujarat|Lata]] and Gurjaras of southern [[Rajasthan]].

These victories earned him the title ''Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy'' (lord of the south). Pulakesi II continued his conquests in the east where he conquered all kingdoms in his way and reached the [[Bay of Bengal]] in present day Orissa. A Chalukya viceroyalty was set up in Gujarat and Vengi (coastal Andhra) and princes from the Badami family were dispatched to rule them. Having subdued the Pallavas of Kanchipuram, he accepted tributes from the [[Pandyas]] of [[Madurai]], [[Chola dynasty]] and [[Chera dynasty|Chera]]s of the Kerala region.

In the middle of 8th century  the Chalukya rule was ended by their feudatory, the Rashtrakuta family rulers of [[Berar]] (in present day [[Amravati district]] of [[Maharashtra]]). Sensing an opportunity during a weak period in the Chalukya rule, [[Dantidurga]] trounced the great Chalukyan "Karnatabala" (power of Karnata).<ref name="bala">From the Rashtrakuta inscriptions (Kamath 2001, p57, p64)</ref><ref name="bala1">The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that feudatory Dantidurga defeated the Chalukyas and humbled their great ''Karnatik'' army (referring to the army of the Badami Chalukyas) (Reu 1933, p54)</ref> Having overthrown the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas  made [[Manyakheta]] their capital (modern Malkhed in [[Gulbarga district]].<ref name="manya">A capital which could put to shame even the capital of gods-From Karda plates (Altekar 1934, p47)</ref><ref name="manya1">A capital city built to excel that of Indra (Sastri, 1955, p4, p132, p146)</ref> Although the origins of the early Rashtrakuta ruling families in central India and the Deccan in the 6th and 7th centuries is controversial, during the eighth through the tenth centuries they emphasised the importance of the Kannada language in conjunction with Sanskrit in their administration. Rashtrakuta inscriptions are in Kannada and Sanskrit only. They encouraged literature in both languages and thus literature flowered under their rule.<ref name="earlylit1">Altekar (1934), pp411–413</ref><ref name="early1">Literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flowered during the Rashtrakuta rule (Kamath 2001, p73, pp 88–89)</ref><ref name="early2">Even royalty of the empire took part in poetic and literary activities (Thapar 2003, p334)</ref><ref name="patron"/><ref name="eralylit2">Reu (1933), pp37–38</ref>

In the late 10th century, the [[Western Chalukya Empire|Western Chalukyas]], also known as the Kalyani Chalukyas or 'Later' Chalukyas rose to power by overthrowing the Rashtrakutas under whom they had been serving as feudatories.  [[Manyakheta]] was their capital early on before they moved it to Kalyani (modern [[Basavakalyan]]).

In 1076, the ascent of the most famous king of this Chalukya family, [[Vikramaditya VI]], changed the balance of power in favour of the Chalukyas.

The Hoysalas had become a powerful force even during their rule from [[Belur]] in the 11th century as a feudatory of the Chalukyas (in the south Karnataka region). In the early 12th century they successfully fought the Cholas in the south, convincingly defeating them in the battle of [[Talakad]] and moved their capital to nearby [[Halebidu]].<ref name="talkad">Vishnuvardhana made many military conquests later to be further expanded by his successors into one of the most powerful empires of South India—William Coelho.

During this period of Hoysala control, distinctive Kannada literary metres such as ''Ragale'' (blank verse), ''Sangatya'' (meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), ''Shatpadi'' (seven line) etc. became widely accepted.<ref name="sang1">Kamath (2001), pp132–134</ref><ref name="sang">Sastri (1955), p359, p361</ref><ref name="patron"/> The Hoysalas expanded the [[Vesara]] architecture stemming from the Badami Chalukyas, culminating in the Hoysala architectural articulation and style as examplified in the construction of the [[Chennakesava Temple]] at Belur and the [[Hoysaleswara temple]] at Halebidu.

In the early 13th century, with the Hoysala power remaining unchallenged, the first of the [[Muslim]] incursions into [[South India]] began. After two decades of waging war against a foreign power, the  Hoysala ruler at the time, [[Veera Ballala III]], died in the battle of [[Madurai]] in 1343. This resulted in the merger of the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire with the areas administered by [[Harihara I]], founder of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], located in the Tungabhadra region in present day Karnataka. The new kingdom thrived for another two centuries with [[Vijayanagara]] as its capital.<ref name="origin">Two theories exist about the origin of Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I.

The Vijayanagara Empire quickly rose to imperial status as early as the late 14th century. During the reign of [[Bukka Raya I]], the island of [[Sri Lanka|Lanka]] paid tributes and ambassadors were exchanged with the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China.<ref name="ming">Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p241</ref><ref name="ming2">Indicated by records of the Ming dynasty (Kamath 2001, p162)</ref> The  empire's most famous rulers were [[Deva Raya II]] and the  [[Tuluva]] king [[Krishnadevaraya]].

Many important monuments at [[Hampi]] were either completed or commissioned during the reign of Krishnadevaraya. The enduring legacy of this empire is the vast open air theatre of monuments at the regal capital, [[Vijayanagara]], which is now a UNESCO World Heritage site.

A diminished Vijayanagara Empire moved its capital to Penukonda in modern Andhra Pradesh and later to [[Chandragiri]] and [[Vellore]] before disintegrating. In the south and coastal Karnataka region, the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and  the [[Keladi Nayaka]] of Shimoga held sway while the northern regions  were under the control of the Bijapur Sultanate.<ref name="break">Kamath (2001), p174</ref> The Nayaka kingdom lasted into the 18th century before merging with the Kingdom of Mysore which remained a princely state until Indian independence in 1947, though they came under the British Raj (rule) in 1799 following the defeat and death of the last independent Mysore king, Tipu Sultan.

==Bahmani Sultanate==
[[Image:Bahamani-sultanate-map.svg|thumb|right|Bahmani Sultanate territories, 1470]]

The [[Bahmani Sultanate]], a contemporary of the Vijayanagara Empire, was founded in 1347 by Alla-ud-din-Hasan, a breakaway commander of the armies of the northern invaders led by [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Mohammed-bin-Tughlaq]]. The capital was initially [[Gulbarga]] but was later moved further north to [[Bidar]].<ref name="bin">Kamath (2001), p190</ref> The first of the Muslim invasions of the Deccan came in the early decades of the 14th century. At its peak, the Bahamani kingdom extended from the [[Krishna River]] in the south to [[Penganga River]] in the north, thus covering the regions of northern parts of modern Karnataka, parts of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The most famous of the Bahamani Kings was Firuz Shah who ruled from 1397 to 1422.<ref name="firuz">Kamath (2001), p191</ref> Militarily, the rule of Firuz Shah had uneven success  against the Vijayanagara kings while he was more convincingly successful against the Kherla rulers of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and the Vema Reddies of [[Rajamundry]], areas that he annexed in 1417. His last encounter with the Vijayanagara armies in 1417 was disastrous and led to his defeat, ill health and ultimate death in 1422.<ref name="firuz"/> 

Contemporary writers such as Tabataba, in his writings have heaped praise on Firuz Shah. Tabataba wrote of the king as, "[a]n impetuous, mighty monarch who patronised learned men, Sheiks and hermits", while Shirazi described him as "a just, pious and generous king and one without equal".<ref name="shirazi">Kamath (2001), p192</ref> In the opinion of one historian, Firuz Shah was one of the most notable Sultans to rule in India.<ref name="shah">Sinha in Kamath (2001), p192</ref> Another well known figure from this kingdom was Kwaja Mahamud Gavan, the prime minister, who served under several kings and regents. He rose above the kings and princess of the dynasty by virtue of his ministerial, administrative, martial, literary and philanthropic abilities. A Persian by descent and a visitor to Bidar in 1445, he impressed the ruling Sultan Alla-ud-din II and was chosen to become a minister in his court.<ref name="gavan">Kamath (2001), p195</ref> As a commander he was able to extend the kingdom from [[Hubli]] in the south to Goa in the west and Kondavidu and Rajamahendri in the east. He soon rose to the position of prime minister (''Vakil-Us-Sultanat'').

The Bahamanis introduced the large scale use of paper in administration and began the Indo-Sarasenic architectural style (also known as ''Deccani'' architecture) with its local influences in Karnataka.<ref name="gavan1">Kamath (2001), p197</ref> The Sultanate monuments of Bidar and Gulbarga are testimony to their interest in architecture. The Bande Nawaz tombs and a Jama Masjid in Gulbarga which exhibits a Spanish influence are well known. In Bidar, their buildings have Persian, Turkish, Arabic and Roman influences (the Solah Khamba mosque being an example).<ref name="Turk">Kamath (2001), p198</ref> Rangin Mahal, Gangan Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Chini Mahal, Nagina Mahal and the Taqk Mahal are some of the palaces built by them that have retained their beauty. The Ahmad Shah Wali tombs are noted for their decor and the school of learning (''madrasa'') built by Gavan in Bidar are also famous.<ref name="tomb">Kamath (2001), p199</ref> In the later part of 15th century, with a growing rift between the local Deccani Muslims and the ''Pardeshi'' Muslims (foreign) who occupied influential positions in the kingdom, the execution of Gavan under dubious circumstances and constant wars with the Vijayanagara kings weakened the Bahamani Kingdom bringing about its end in 1527.<ref name="end">Kamath (2001), p194</ref>

==Bijapur Sultanate==
[[Image:Bijapur-sultanate-map.svg|thumb|right|Bijapur Sultanate territories under Ibrahim II, 1620]]
[[Image:GolGumbaz2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gol Gumbaz]] at [[Bijapur]]]]

The [[Bijapur Sultanate]] (or Adilshahi Kingdom) emerged towards the end of the 15th century with the weakening of the Bahmani Sultanate . The main sources of information about this kingdom comes from  contemporeneous inscriptions and writings in Persian and Kannada, travelogues of European visitors to the Deccan and inscriptions of neighbouring kingdoms.<ref name="bija">Kamath (2001), p200</ref> In 1489, Yusuf Adilkhan, a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] general in the Bahmani army, broke away to found the kingdom from modern Bijapur . Throughout his rule, the Sultanate was at war with the Vijayanagara Empire over the strategic [[Raichur]] doab, with the Portuguese over [[Goa]], with the Barid Shahis of Bidar and later with the erstwhile feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire who had gained independence after 1565. The [[Italy|Italian]] writer Varathema wrote about the founder Adilkhan and Bijapur, "A powerful and prosperous king", "the city was encircled by many fortifications and contained beautiful and majestic buildings".<ref name="bija"/>

Inter-Sultanate marriages normalised relations and Ali I (1557–1580) joined a confederacy of Sultanates who eventually inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565.<ref name="conf">Kamath (2001), p201</ref> The most notable ruler of the dynasty was Ibrahim II (1580–1626) who ascended the throne as a nine year old with Chandbibi, the king's aunt acting as the regent. Later when Ibrahim II was defeated by the first of the Moghul incursions into the Deccan, he gave his daughter in marriage to Daniyal, a son of Emperor [[Akbar]], but managed to collect tributes from the former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire.<ref name="erst">Kamath (2001), p202</ref> According to a historian, the rule of Ibrahim II was the high point of the Bijapur Sultanate.<ref name="high">Sinha in Kamath (2001), p2002</ref> A tolerant king inclined to the fine arts, the earliest book on music in Urdu language called ''Kitab-e-Nauras'' is ascribed to him. The opening song in the book is an invocation of the Hindu Goddess [[Saraswati]].<ref name="erst"/> During the rule of his son Muhammad, Shahji Bhosle from [[Ahmadnagar]] joined the Bijapur army and along with commander Ranadullah Khan conducted many successful campaigns in the southern Deccan collecting tribute from local rulers there. The final end of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from [[Vellore]] came during these campaigns.<ref name="camp">Kamath (2001), p203</ref> 

However, the rise of [[Maratha empire|Maratha]] [[Shivaji]] and constant invasions by the [[Moguls]] from the north took its toll on the kingdom, eventually bringing it to an end in the later part of 17th century. The contributions of the Bijapur Sultanate in the Indo-Saracenic idiom to the architectural landscape of Karnataka  is noteworthy. Their most famous monuments are the mausoleums called Ibrahim Rauza and the [[Gol Gumbaz]] apart from many other palaces and mosques.<ref name="gol">Kamath (2001), p207</ref> The elegance, finish and beauty of Mehtar Mahal is claimed by a historian to be equal to anything in [[Cairo]].<ref name="cairo"> Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p207</ref> Their Kali Masjid at [[Lakshmeshwar]] is a synthesis of Hindu and Muslim styles. The Ibrahim Rauza built by Ibrahim II is a combination of a mausoleum and a mosque and is called the "[[Taj Mahal]] of the Deccan".<ref name="taj">Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p208</ref> The [[Gol Gumbaz]] built by Muhammad  is the largest dome in India and the fourth largest in the world with an impressive "whispering gallery". Some historians consider this one of the architectural marvels of the world.<ref name="gumbuz">Kamath (2001), p209</ref> Persian language was given state patronage while the use of the local languages, Kannada and Marathi was popularised in local affairs.<ref name="localaffairs">Kamath (2001), p206</ref>

The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 at the [[Battle of Talikota]] started a slow disintegration of the region into minor kingdoms, the largest of which were the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Mysore]], the [[Keladi Nayaka]]s and the [[Nayakas of Chitradurga]].<ref name="tali">Kamath (2001), p171</ref> These kingdoms continued to owe support to a diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from [[Penukonda]] in modern [[Andhra Pradesh]], followed by a brief period of independence. However, large areas in north Karnataka came under the control of the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] who waged several wars in a bid to establish a hegemony over the southern Deccan.<ref name="vel">Kamath (2006), pp173–174</ref> The defeat of the Bijapur Sultanate at the hands of the Moguls in late 17th century added a new dimension to the prevailing confusion.<ref name="dim">Kamath (2006), p204</ref> The constant wars of the local kingdoms with the two new rivals, the Moguls and the Marathas and among themselves  caused further instability in the region.<ref name="lek">Kamath (2001), p226</ref> Major areas of Karnataka came under the rule of the [[Moguls]] and the [[Marathas]], until the rise of local Muslims, [[Hyder Ali]] and his son [[Tipu Sultan]]. Under them the Mysore Kingdom reached its zenith of power but had to face the growing English power who by now had a firm foothold in the subcontinent.<ref name="tip">Kamath (2001), p231–234</ref> With the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799 in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war, the Mysore Kingdom came under the British umbrella.  More than a century later, with the dawn of India as an independent nation in 1947, the [[Unification of Karnataka|unification of Kannada speaking regions]] as modern Karnataka state brought four centuries of political uncertainty (and centuries of foreign rule) to an end.
