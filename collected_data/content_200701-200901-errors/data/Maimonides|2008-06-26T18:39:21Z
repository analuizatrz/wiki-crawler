'''Moses Maimonides''' ([[March 30]] [[1135]] [[Córdoba, Spain]] – [[December 13]] [[1204]] [[Fustat|Fostat,]] [[Egypt]])<ref>[http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/people/maimonides.htm Maimonides (1135-1204) - ReligionFacts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, was a [[rabbi]], [[physician]], and [[philosopher]] in [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]], [[Morocco]] and [[Egypt]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. He was the preeminent medieval [[Judaism|Jewish]] philosopher, and his ideas also influenced the non-Jewish world. 

One of the central tenets of Maimonides' philosophy is that it is impossible for the truths arrived at by human intellect to contradict those revealed by God. Maimonides held to a strictly [[apophatic theology]] in which only negative statements toward a description of God may be considered correct. Thus, one does not say "God is One", but rather, "God is not multiple". Although many of his ideas met with the opposition of his contemporaries, Maimonides was embraced by later Jewish and many non-Jewish thinkers. [[Thomas Aquinas]] held him in high esteem, and the fourteen-volume [[Mishneh Torah]] today retains canonical authority as a codification of [[Talmud]]ic law.

Although his copious works on Jewish law and ethics were initially met with opposition during his lifetime, he was posthumously acknowledged to be one of the foremost rabbinical [[posek|arbiters]] and philosophers in [[Jewish history]]. Today, his works and his views are considered a cornerstone of Jewish thought and study.

== Name ==
Maimonides' full Hebrew name was ''Moshe ben Maimon'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: '''משה בן מימון''') and his [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name was ''Abu Imran Mussa bin Maimun ibn Abdallah al-Qurtubi al-Israili'' (أبو عمران موسى بن ميمون بن عبد الله القرطبي الإسرائيلي). However, he is most commonly known for his [[Greek language|Greek]] name, '''Moses Maimonides''' (Μωυσής Μαϊμονίδης). All of these names literally mean "Moses, son of Maimon." Several Jewish works call him Maimoni (מימוני). However, most Jewish works refer to him by the Hebrew acronym of his title and name — '''R'''abbi '''M'''oshe '''b'''en '''M'''aimon — thus, among Jews he is known as the '''Rambam''' (רמב"ם).

==Biography==
Maimonides was born in [[1135]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]]. His year of birth is disputed, with [[Shlomo Pines]] suggesting that he was born in 1138. He was born during what some scholars consider to be the end of the [[golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]], after the first centuries of the [[Moors|Moorish]] rule. At an early age, he developed an interest in the exact sciences and philosophy. In addition to reading the works of [[Muslim scholars]], he also read those of the [[Greek philosophers]] made accessible through Arabic translations. Maimonides was not known as a supporter of [[Kabbalah|Mysticism]]. He voiced opposition to poetry, the best of which he declared as false, since it was founded on pure invention - and this too in a land which had produced such noble expressions of the Hebrew and Arabic muse. This [[philosopher|Sage]], who was revered for his saintly personality as well as for his writings, led an unquiet life, and penned his classic works with the staff of the wanderer in his hand.<ref name = "Americana 18 140">1954 Encyclopedia Americana, vol. 18, p. 140.</ref>  Maimonides [[Torah study|studied Torah]] under his father Maimon, who had in turn studied under [[Rabbi]] [[Joseph ibn Migash]].

The [[Almohad dynasty|Almohades]] from Africa conquered [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in [[1148]], and threatened the [[Kehilla|Jewish community]] with the choice of [[Forced_conversion#Islam|conversion to Islam]], [[martyrdom|death]], or [[exile]].<ref name = "Americana 18 140" /> Maimonides' family, along with most other [[Jews]], chose exile. For the next ten years they moved about in southern [[Al-Andalus|Spain]], avoiding the conquering Almohades, but eventually settled in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in [[Morocco]], where Maimonides acquired most of his secular knowledge, studying at the [[University of Al Karaouine]]. During this time, he composed his acclaimed [[Bible commentary|commentary]] on the [[Mishnah]].

Following this sojourn in [[Morocco]], he lived briefly in the [[Holy Land (Biblical)|Holy Land]], before settling in [[Fostat]], [[Egypt]], where he was [[physician]] of the [[Grand Vizier]] Alfadhil and  [[Sultan]] [[Saladin]] of Egypt, and also treated [[Richard the Lionheart]] while on the [[Crusades]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Nash, Elizabeth |title=Seville, C'ordoba, and Granada : A Cultural History (Cityscapes) |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-19-518204-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  He was considered to be the greatest physician of his time, being influenced by renowned [[Islamic]] thinkers such as [[Ibn Rushd]] and [[Al-Ghazali]].<ref name = "H-Net" /><ref name = "Islamic Influences" />  He composed most of his ''œuvre'' in this last locale, including the [[Mishneh Torah]]. He died in [[Fustat|Fostat]], and was buried in [[Tiberias]] (today in [[land of Israel|Israel]]).  His son [[Avraham son of Rambam|Avraham]], recognized as a great scholar, succeeded Maimonides as ''[[Nagid]]'' (head of the [[Egypt]]ian [[Kehilla|Jewish community]]); he also took up his father's role as court [[physician]], at the age of eighteen. He greatly honored the memory of his father, and throughout his career defended his father's writings against all critics.  The office of ''[[Nagid]]'' was held by the Maimonides family for four successive generations until the end of the [[14th century]].

Maimonides was a devoted physician. In a famous letter, he describes his daily routine: After visiting the Sultan’s palace, he would arrive home exhausted and hungry, where "I would find the antechambers filled with gentiles and Jews ... I would go to heal them, and write prescriptions for their illnesses ... until the evening ... and I would be extremely weak."<ref>''Responsa Pe’er HaDor'', 143.</ref>

He is widely respected in Spain and a statue of him was erected in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] by the only [[synagogue]] in that city which escaped destruction, and which is no longer functioning as a Jewish house of worship but is open to the public.

==Works and bibliography==
[[Image:Manuscript page by Maimonides Arabic in Hebrew letters.jpg|thumb|150px|Manuscript page by Maimonides. [[Judeo-Arabic language]] in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters.]]

Maimonides composed both works of Jewish scholarship, [[halakhah|rabbinic law]], philosophy, and medical texts. Most of Maimonides' works were written in Arabic. However, the ''Mishneh Torah'' was written in Hebrew. His Judaism texts were:
* ''[[Mishnah#Commentaries|Commentary on the Mishna]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Pirush Hamishnayot''),  written in Arabic. This text was one of the first commentaries of its kind; its introductory sections are widely quoted.
* ''[[Sefer Hamitzvot]]'' ([[translation|trans.]] ''The Book of Commandments'').
* Sefer Ha'shamad (letter of Martydom)
* ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', also known as ''Sefer Yad ha-Chazaka'', a comprehensive [[code of law|code]] of Jewish law;
* ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', a philosophical work harmonising and differentiating [[Aristotle]]'s philosophy and Jewish theology;
* ''Teshuvot'', collected correspondence and [[responsa]], including a number of public letters (on resurrection and the [[after-life]], on conversion to other faiths, and ''[[The Yemen Epistle|Iggereth Teiman]]'' - addressed to the oppressed Jewry of [[Yemen]]).
* ''Treatise on [[Logic]]''  (Arabic: ''Makala Fi-Sinat Al-Mantik'') has been printed 17 times, including editions in [[Latin]] ([[1527]]), [[German language|German]] ([[1805]], [[1822]], [[1833]], [[1828]]), [[French language|French]] ([[1935]]), and [[English language|English]] ([[1938]]), and in an abridged Hebrew form. 

Maimonides wrote a number of medical texts, some of which are still in existence. The best known is his collection of [[medical]] [[aphorism]]s, titled ''Fusul Musa'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ("Chapters of Moses," ''Pirkei Moshe'' in Hebrew). We also have a ''Treatise on [[Poison]]s and their Antidotes'', ''Treatise on [[Hemorrhoids]]'', ''Treatise on Cohabitation'', ''Treatise on the Regimen of Health'', ''Treatise on the Causes of Symptoms'', ''Laws of Human Temperaments'', and ''Treatise on [[Asthma]]''. Such works have been translated by [[Jewish medical ethics|Jewish medical ethicist]] [[Fred Rosner]].

==Influence==
[[Image:Guide for the Perplexed by Maimonides.jpg|thumb|150px|The title page of ''The Guide for the Perplexed'']]
Maimonides was by far the most influential figure in medieval [[Jewish philosophy]]. A popular medieval saying that also served as his [[epitaph]] states, ''From [[Moses|Moshe]] (of the Torah) to Moshe (Maimonides) there was none like Moshe.''

Radical Jewish scholars in the centuries that followed can be characterised as "Maimonideans" or "anti-Maimonideans."  Moderate scholars were eclectics who largely accepted Maimonides' [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] world-view, but rejected those elements of it which they considered to contradict the religious tradition.  Such eclecticism reached its height in the 14th-15th centuries.

The most rigorous medieval critique of Maimonides is [[Crescas|Hasdai Crescas]]' ''[[Or Hashem]]''.  Crescas bucked the eclectic trend, by demolishing the certainty of the Aristotelian world-view, not only in religious matters, but even in the most basic areas of medieval [[science]] (such as physics and geometry). [[Crescas]]' critique provoked a number of 15th century scholars to write defenses of Maimonides. A translation of Crescas was produced by [[Harry Austryn Wolfson]] of [[Harvard University]], in [[1929]].

==The 13 principles of faith==<!-- This section is linked from [[Judaism]] -->
{{main|Jewish principles of faith}}

In his commentary on the Mishna (tractate Sanhedrin, chapter 10), Maimonides formulates his '''13 principles of faith'''. They summarized what he viewed as the required beliefs of Judaism with regards to:
# The [[existence of God]]
# God's [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|unity]]
# God's [[spirituality]] and [[incorporeal]]ity
# God's [[eternity]]
# [[God in Judaism#To God alone may one offer prayer|God alone]] should be the object of [[worship]]
# [[Revelation]] through God's [[prophet]]s
# The preeminence of [[Moses]] among the prophets
# God's law given on [[Mount Sinai]]
# The immutability of the [[Torah]] as God's Law
# God's [[Divine Providence#In Jewish thought|foreknowledge]] of human actions
# Reward of good and [[retributive justice|retribution]] of evil
# The coming of the [[Jewish Messiah]]
# The [[resurrection]] of the dead

These principles were controversial when first proposed, evoking criticism by Rabbi [[Hasdai Crescas]] and Rabbi [[Joseph Albo]], and were effectively ignored by much of the Jewish community for the next few centuries. ("Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought," Menachem Kellner). However, these principles became widely held; today, [[Orthodox Judaism]] holds these beliefs to be obligatory.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Two poetic restatements of these principles (''[[Ani Ma'amin]]'' and ''[[Yigdal]]'') eventually became canonized in the "[[siddur]]" (Jewish prayer book).

==Legal works==
[[Image:Mishna tora44.jpg|thumb|150px|A recent newly corrected version of Mishneh Torah, Maimonides' main work of Halakha]]
{{main|Mishneh Torah}}
With ''Mishneh Torah'', Maimonides composed a code of [[Jewish law]] with the widest-possible scope and depth. The work gathers all the binding laws from the [[Talmud]], and incorporates the positions of the [[Geonim]] (post-Talmudic early Medieval scholars, mainly from [[Mesopotamia]]).

While ''Mishneh Torah'' is now considered the fore-runner of the [[Arbaah Turim]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}} (two later codes), it met initially with much opposition{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. There were two main reasons for this opposition. Firstly, Maimonides had refrained from adding references to his work for the sake of brevity; secondly, in the introduction, he gave the impression of wanting to "cut out" study of the Talmud<ref>Last section of Maimonides' Introduction to Mishneh Torah</ref>, to arrive at a conclusion in Jewish law. His most forceful opponents were the rabbis of [[Provence]] (Southern France), and a running critique by Rabbi [[Abraham ben David]] (Raavad III) is printed in virtually all editions of Mishneh Torah.  However, it was recognized as a monumental contribution to the systemized writing of [[Halakha]].  Throughout the centuries, it has been widely studied and its halakhic decisions have weighed heavily in later rulings.

An oft-cited legal maxim from his pen is: "It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."<ref>Moses Maimonides, Sefer Hamitzvot, Negative Commandment no. 290.</ref> Maimonides argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely "according to the judge's caprice."<ref>Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–71 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).</ref>

==Philosophy==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=May 2008}}

Through the ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' and the philosophical introductions to sections of his commentaries on the Mishna, Maimonides exerted an important influence on the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers, especially on [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Duns Scotus]]. He was himself a Jewish Scholastic. Educated more by reading the works of Arab Muslim philosophers than by personal contact with Arabian teachers, he acquired an intimate acquaintance not only with Arab Muslim philosophy, but with the doctrines of [[Aristotle]]. Maimonides strove to reconcile [[Wiktionary:Aristotelian|Aristotelian]] [[philosophy]] and science with the teachings of the [[Bible|Torah]].

===Negative theology===
{{Judaism}}
The principle which inspired his philosophical activity was identical with the fundamental tenet of Scholasticism: there can be no contradiction between the truths which [[God]] has revealed, and the findings of the human mind in science and philosophy. Maimonides primarily relied upon the science of [[Aristotle]] and the teachings of the [[Talmud]], commonly finding basis in the former for the latter. In some important points, however, he departed from the teaching of [[Aristotle]]; for instance, he rejected the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine that [[God]]'s provident care extends only to humanity, and not to the individual.

Maimonides was led by his admiration for the [[neo-Platonism|neo-Platonic]] commentators to maintain many doctrines which the Scholastics could not accept. For instance, Maimonides was an adherent of "[[negative theology]]" (also known as "Apophatic theology".) In this theology, one attempts to describe [[God]] through negative attributes. For instance, one should not say that [[God]] exists in the usual sense of the term; all we can safely say is that [[God]] is not non-existent. We should not say that "[[God]] is wise"; but we can say that "[[God]] is not ignorant," i.e. in some way, [[God]] has some properties of knowledge. We should not say that "[[God]] is One," but we can state that "there is no multiplicity in [[God]]'s being." In brief, the attempt is to gain and express knowledge of [[God]] by describing what [[God]] is not; rather than by describing what [[God]] "is."

The Scholastics agreed with him that no predicate is adequate to express the nature of [[God]]; but they did not go so far as to say that no term can be applied to [[God]] in the affirmative sense. They admitted that while "eternal," "omnipotent," etc., as we apply them to [[God]], are inadequate, at the same time we may say "[[God]] is eternal" etc., and need not stop, as Moses did, with the negative "[[God]] is not not-eternal," etc.  In essence what Maimonides wanted to express is that when people give [[God]] anthropomorphic qualities they do not do justice to His greatness.

===Prophecy===
He agrees with "the philosophers" in teaching that, man's intelligence being one in the series of intelligences emanating from [[God]], the [[prophet]] must, by study and meditation, lift himself up to the degree of perfection required in the [[prophet]]ic state. But here, he invokes the authority of "the Law," which teaches that, after that perfection is reached, there is required the "free acts of [[God]]," before the man actually becomes a [[prophet]].

===The problem of evil===
Maimonides wrote on [[theodicy]] (the philosophical attempt to reconcile the existence of a [[God]] with the existence of evil in the world). He took the premise that an omnipotent and good [[God]] exists. He adopts the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] view that defines evil as the lack of, or the reduced presence of a [[God]], as exhibited by those who exercise the free choice of rejecting belief.

===Astrology===
Maimonides answered an inquiry concerning [[astrology]], addressed to him from [[Marseille]]. He responded that man should believe only what can be supported either by rational proof, by the evidence of the senses, or by trustworthy authority. He affirms that he had studied astrology, and that it does not deserve to be described as a science. The supposition that the fate of a man could be dependent upon the constellations is ridiculed by him; he argues that such a theory would rob life of purpose, and would make man a slave of destiny. (See also [[fatalism]], [[predestination]].)

===True beliefs versus necessary beliefs===
In "[[Guide for the Perplexed]]" Book III, Chapter 28<ref>http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp164.htm Guide for the Perplexed, on sacred-texts.com</ref>, Maimonides explicitly draws a distinction between "true beliefs," which were beliefs about [[God]] which produced intellectual perfection, and "necessary beliefs," which were conducive to improving social order. Maimonides places anthropomorphic personification statements about [[God]] in the latter class.  He uses as an example the notion that [[God]] becomes "angry" with people who do wrong.  In the view of Maimonides (taken from [[Avicenna]]) [[God]] does not actually become angry with people, as [[God]] has no human passions; but it is important for them to believe [[God]] does, so that they desist from sinning.

=== Resurrection, acquired immortality, and the afterlife ===
Maimonides distinguishes two kinds of intelligence in man, the one material in the sense of being dependent on, and influenced by, the body, and the other immaterial, that is, independent of the bodily organism. The latter is a direct emanation from the universal [[active intellect]]; this is his interpretation of the ''noûs poietikós'' of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] philosophy. It is acquired as the result of the efforts of the soul to attain a correct knowledge of the absolute, pure intelligence of [[God]].

The knowledge of [[God]] is a form of knowledge which develops in us the immaterial intelligence, and thus confers on man an immaterial, spiritual nature. This confers on the soul that perfection in which human happiness consists, and endows the soul with immortality. One who has attained a correct knowledge of [[God]] has reached a condition of existence which renders him immune from all the accidents of fortune, from all the allurements of sin, and even from death itself. Man, therefore is in a position not only to work out his own salvation and immortality.

The resemblance between this doctrine and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s doctrine of immortality is so striking as to warrant the hypothesis that there is a causal dependence of the latter on the earlier doctrine. The differences between the two [[Judaism|Jewish]] thinkers are, however, as remarkable as the resemblance. While Spinoza teaches that the way to attain the knowledge which confers immortality is the progress from sense-knowledge through scientific knowledge to philosophical intuition of all things ''sub specie æternitatis'', Maimonides holds that the road to perfection and immortality is the path of duty as described in the [[Torah]] and the rabbinic understanding of the [[oral law]].

Religious Jews not only believed in immortality in some spiritual sense, but most believed that there would at some point in the future be a messianic era, and a resurrection of the dead. This is the subject of [[Jewish eschatology]]. Maimonides wrote much on this topic, but in most cases he wrote about the immortality of the soul for people of perfected intellect; his writings were usually ''not'' about the resurrection of dead bodies.  This prompted hostile criticism from the rabbis of his day, and sparked a controversy over his true views.

Rabbinic works usually refer to this afterlife as "[[Jewish eschatology|Olam Haba]]" (the World to Come).  Some [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinic works]] use this phrase to refer to a messianic era, an era of history right here on [[Earth]]; in other rabbinic works this phrase refers to a purely spiritual realm.  It was during Maimonides's lifetime that this lack of agreement flared into a full blown controversy, with Maimonides charged as a [[heresy|heretic]] by some [[Judaism|Jewish]] leaders.

Some Jews at this time taught that [[Judaism]] did not require a belief in the physical resurrection of the dead, as the afterlife would be a purely spiritual realm.  They used Maimonides' works on this subject to back up their position.  In return, their opponents claimed that this was outright heresy;  for them the afterlife was right here on Earth, where [[God]] would raise dead bodies from the grave so that the resurrected could live eternally. Maimonides was brought into this dispute by both sides, as the first group stated that his writings agreed with them, and the second group portrayed him as a heretic for writing that the afterlife is for the immaterial spirit alone. Eventually, Maimonides felt pressured to write a treatise on the subject, the "''Ma'amar Tehiyyat Hametim''" "The Treatise on Resurrection."

Chapter two of the treatise on resurrection refers to those who believe that the world to come involves physically resurrected bodies. Maimonides refers to one with such beliefs as being an "utter fool" whose belief is "folly".

:If one of the multitude refuses to believe [that angels are incorporeal] and prefers to believe that angels have bodies and even that they eat, since it is written (Genesis 18:8) 'they ate', or that those who exist in the World to Come will also have bodies&mdash;we won't hold it against him or consider him a heretic, and we will not distance ourselves from him.  May there not be many who profess this folly, and let us hope that he will go no farther than this in his folly and believe that the Creator is corporeal.

However, Maimonides also writes that those who claimed that he altogether believed the verses of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] referring to the resurrection were only allegorical were spreading falsehoods and "revolting" statements.  Maimonides asserts that belief in resurrection is a fundamental truth of Judaism about which there is no disagreement, and that it is not permissible for a Jew to support anyone who believes differently. He cites [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 12:2 and 12:13 as definitive proofs of physical resurrection of the dead when they state "many of them that sleep in the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence" and "But you, go your way till the end; for you shall rest, and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days."

While these two positions may be seen as in contradiction (non-corporeal eternal life, versus a bodily resurrection), Maimonides resolves them with a then unique solution: Maimonides believed that the resurrection was not permanent or general. In his view, [[God]] never violates the laws of nature. Rather, divine interaction is by way of [[angel]]s, which Maimonides holds to be metaphors for the laws of nature, the principles by which the physical universe operates, or Platonic eternal forms. Thus, if a unique event actually occurs, even if it is perceived as a miracle, it is not a violation of the world's order.<ref>Commentary on the Mishna, Avot 5:6</ref>

In this view, any dead who are resurrected must eventually die again. In his discussion of the [[Jewish principles of faith|13 principles of faith]], the first five deal with knowledge of [[God]], the next four deal with prophecy and the Torah, while the last four deal with reward, punishment and the ultimate redemption. In this discussion Maimonides says nothing of a universal resurrection. All he says it is that whatever resurrection does take place, it will occur at an indeterminate time before the world to come, which he repeatedly states will be purely spiritual.

He writes "It appears to us on the basis of these verses (Daniel 12:2,13) that those people who will return to those bodies will eat, drink, copulate, beget, and die after a very long life, like the lives of those who will live in the Days of the Messiah." Maimonides thus disassociated the resurrection of the dead from both the World to Come and the Messianic era.

In his time, many Jews believed that the physical resurrection was identical to the world to come; thus denial of a permanent and universal resurrection was considered tantamount to denying the words of the Talmudic sages. However, instead of denying the resurrection, or maintaining the current dogma, Maimonides posited a third way: That resurrection had nothing to do with the messianic era (here in this world) nor to do with [[Jewish eschatology|Olam Haba]] (עולם הבא) (the purely spiritual afterlife). Rather, he considered resurrection to be a miracle that the book of Daniel predicted; thus at some point in time we could expect some instances of resurrection to occur temporarily, which would have no place in the final eternal life of the righteous.

==Maimonides and the Modernists==
Maimonides remains the most widely debated [[Judaism|Jewish]] thinker among modern scholars.  He has been adopted as a symbol and an intellectual hero by almost all major movements in modern Judaism, and has proven immensely important to philosophers such as [[Leo Strauss]]; and his views on the importance of [[humility]] have been taken up by modern [[humanism|humanist]] philosophers, like [[Peter Singer]] and [[Iain King]].  Maimonides' importance to diverse systems of thought lies in the philosopher's embrace of paradoxical and often contradictory ideas. Maimonides' reconciliation of the philosophical and the traditional has given his legacy an extremely diverse and dynamic quality.

==Cultural legacy==
[[Image:Maimonides stamp.jpg|thumb|150px|Maimonides on a stamp]]
Thanks to his extraordinary reputation, Maimonides has been memorialized in numerous ways. For example, there is a [[Maimonides School]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], the Brauser Maimonides Academy in [[Hollywood, Florida]],[http://www.floridajewishnews.com/site/a/major_grant_awarded_to_maimonides/] and [[Maimonides Medical Center]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York. In 2004, conferences were held at [[Yale]], [[Florida International University]], [[Penn State]], and the Rambam hospital in Haifa. To commemorate the 800th anniversary of his death, [[Harvard University]] issued a memorial volume. [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/HARMAM.html] In 2006, the Israel Postal Authority issued a [[postage stamp]] of Maimonides, pictured. In March of 2008, during the [[Euromed]] Conference of Ministers of Tourism, The Tourism Ministries of [[Israel]], [[Morocco]] and [[Spain]] agreed to work together on a joint project that will trace the footsteps of the Rambam and thus boost religious tourism in the cities of [[Cordoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Fez]] and [[Tiberias]] [http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1209627041328&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull].
