{{main|History of Grand Forks, North Dakota}}

Prior to settlement by Europeans or Americans, the area where the city now sits (at the forks of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] and [[Red Lake River]]) had been an important meeting and trading point for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Early [[France|French]] explorers, [[animal trapping|fur trappers]], and traders called the area ''Les Grandes Fourches'' (meaning "The Grand Forks"). By the 1740s, ''Les Grandes Fourches'' was an important [[trading post]] for French fur trappers.<ref name="history"/>

A U.S. post office was established on the site on [[June 15]], [[1870]] and the name was changed to "Grand Forks."<ref name="history"/> [[Alexander Griggs]], a [[steamboat]] captain, is regarded as being "The Father of Grand Forks."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prairiepublic.org/programs/datebook/bydate/03/1003/102603.jsp |title=Dakota Datebook, October 20,2003: Griggs and Grand Forks |accessdate=2007-06-08 |format= |work=North Dakota Public Radio}}</ref> Griggs' steamboat froze in the Red River on a voyage in late 1870, forcing the captain and his crew to spend the winter camping at Grand Forks. Griggs platted the community in 1875 and Grand Forks was officially incorporated on [[February 22]], [[1881]].<ref name="history"/> The city quickly grew after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (US)|Great Northern Railway]] in 1880 and the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] in 1887.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grandforkshistory.com/index_files/page0002.htm |title=Historic Grand Forks |accessdate=2007-06-08 |format= |work=Grand Forks County Historical Society}}</ref> In 1883, the [[University of North Dakota]] was established, six years before North Dakota was formally recognized as an independent state (born from the [[Dakota Territory]]).<ref name="und"/>

The first half of the 1900s saw steady growth and the development of new neighborhoods farther south and west of [[Downtown Grand Forks]]. The 1920s saw the construction of the [[public ownership|state-owned]] [[North Dakota Mill and Elevator]] on the north side of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ndmill.com/ndmill/mill/history.htm |title=History |accessdate=2007-06-08 |format= |work=North Dakota Mill and Elevator }}</ref> In 1954, Grand Forks was chosen as the site for an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] base.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://public.grandforks.amc.af.mil/documents/History2003.pdf |title=History of the Grand Forks Air Force Base |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work= }}</ref> [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]] brought thousands of new jobs and residents to the community. The military base and the University of North Dakota would become integral pieces of the city's economy. The second half of the 20th century saw Grand Forks spreading further away from the older part of town.<ref name="history"/> [[Interstate 29]] was built on the western side of the city and two enclosed shopping malls - [[Grand Cities Mall|South Forks Plaza]] and [[Columbia Mall (Grand Forks)|Columbia Mall]] - were built on the south side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/library/Collections/og1242.html |title=Grand Forks, Mayor's Office |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=University of North Dakota }}</ref>

The city was struck by a [[1997 Red River Flood|severe flood in 1997]], causing extensive damage.<ref name="flood"/> With [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] upstream from the bulk of the waters and [[Winnipeg]] with its flood control structures, Grand Forks became the hardest hit city in the [[Red River Valley]]. During the height of the flooding, a major fire also destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. Many neighborhoods had to be demolished to make way for a new [[levee]] system which was ultimately completed ten years later. The land bordering the Red River was turned into a massive park known as the [[Greater Grand Forks Greenway]]. Since the flood, Grand Forks has seen both public and private developments throughout town. Two new, large sports venues opened in 2001, including the [[Alerus Center]]<ref name="alerus"/> and the [[Ralph Engelstad Arena]].<ref name="rea"/> In 2007, the [[Winnipeg]]-based [[Canad Inns]] hotel chain opened a 13-story hotel and waterpark adjacent to the Alerus Center.<ref name="canad">{{cite web |url=http://www.canadinns.com/grandforks/
|title=Grand Forks |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=Canad Inns }}</ref> As of 2007, Grand Forks has a larger population than it did before the 1997 flood and area employment and taxable sales have also surpassed pre-flood levels.<ref name="postflood"/>

==Economy==
The economy of Grand Forks is not dominated by any one industry or sector. While agriculture continues to play a role in the area's economy, the city of Grand Forks now has a relatively diverse economy that includes public and private employers in sectors such as education, defense, health care, manufacturing, and food processing.<ref name="community"/><ref name="employers"/>

===Major employers===
[[Image:LMGlasfiberBlade.jpg|200px|right|thumbnail|Employees at LM Glasfiber work on a giant blade for a wind turbine]]
The state and federal governments operate two of the largest employers in the Grand Forks area. The [[University of North Dakota]], located in the heart of the city, is the largest employer in the metropolitan area.<ref name="employers"/> Nearby [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]], located just west of the city, employs a large number of civilian workers in addition to its enlisted personnel. [[Altru Health System]] is the largest private employer in Grand Forks.<ref name="employers"/>

Major manufacturers in Grand Forks include [[LM Glasfiber]]<ref name="lm">{{cite web |url=http://www.lmglasfiber.com/About/Contact.aspx |title=Contact |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=LM Glasfiber }}</ref> (which makes blades for wind turbines) and [[Cirrus Design]]<ref name="cirrus">{{cite web |url=http://www.cirrusdesign.com/contact/employment/default.aspx |title=Employment |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=Cirrus Design }}</ref> (which constructs a portion of a small aircraft).

The retail and service sector is also an important part of the economy. Depending on the relative strength of the [[Canadian dollar]] versus the [[American dollar]], the Greater Grand Forks area attracts numbers of tourist shoppers from [[Manitoba]] and especially from [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]]. Grand Forks is a popular weekend destination for many Manitobans.<ref name="dollar">{{cite news|last=Noronha  |first=Charmaine|title=Currency goes loonie|work=Associated Press|date=2007-06-05|url=http://www.grandforksherald.com/articles/?id=39723|accessdate=}}</ref>

===Economic development===
The city government is actively involved in the economic development process, helping existing firms grow and attracting new ones. A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some of it going into the Grand Forks Growth Fund.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandforks.org/businessresources/localstateprograms.php |title=Business Resources - Local and State Programs |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=The Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation }}</ref> Companies can request low-interest loans or grants from this fund provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city's trade region. The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that also receives funding from banks and other major businesses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandforks.org/gfredc/faq.php |title=About us |accessdate=2007-06-11 |format= |publisher=Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation }}</ref> The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they're suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.

UND has long been seen by community leaders as an "economic engine" for the city. Besides its regular faculty, it also has business-like components such as the [[Energy and Environmental Research Center]]. UND hosts a technology incubator called the Center for Innovation. More recently, the University has been working to commercialize its research. A major thrust in that direction is the construction of a research park on the western fringes of the campus.<ref name="und"/>

Another potential economic opportunity for the city is the addition of the [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) mission to [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]]. The base currently hosts [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]s, which will gradually be transferred to other bases around the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/grand-forks.htm |title=Grand Forks AFB |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=GlobalSecurity.org }}</ref>

Grand Forks uses the [[mayor-council government|mayor-council]] model of [[municipal government]]. The mayor, who is elected every four years, has the power to oversee the daily administration of city government and to work directly with department heads to ensure the proper provision of services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandforksgov.com/gfgov/home.nsf/Pages/Mayor's+Office |title=Mayor Brown |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=City of Grand Forks, North Dakota }}</ref> The current mayor of Grand Forks is [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] [[Michael Brown (mayor)|Dr. Michael Brown]]. He was first elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004. 

The city is divided into seven wards with each ward electing a single city council representative for a four year term. The council meets twice each month as the council proper and twice each month as a [[committee of the whole]]. All council meetings are broadcast on a local cable channel.<ref name="citycouncil"/>

Grand Forks has an active [[town twinning|sister city]] program designed to encourage cultural and economic exchanges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandforksgov.com/gfgov/home.nsf/Pages/Sister+Cities |title=Sister Cities |accessdate=2007-06-11 |format= |publisher=City of Grand Forks }}</ref> In the case of [[Dickinson, North Dakota]], the relationship is also a political alliance.<ref>{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Lisa|title=Sister city delegates visit GF|work=Grand Forks Herald|date=2003-10-19|url=http://www.prairiepublic.org/features/riverwatch/news/herald/10_19_03.html |accessdate=2007-06-05 }}</ref>

Grand Forks' first sister city was [[Ishim]] in the [[Soviet Union]].  The relationship with the [[Siberia]]n city formally began in 1984 during the [[Cold War]], but progressed slowly due to red tape.  In fact, the first in-person exchanges didn't happen until 1990, following [[glasnost]].  More exchanges followed despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Sometime in the late 1990s, though, political and economic turmoil in [[Russia]] put the relationship in deep freeze from which it has yet to recover.<ref name="sister">{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Yangkyoung|title=$5 million godsend|work=Grand Forks Herald|date=2007-05-02|url=|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref>

While the relationship with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in [[Awano, Tochigi|Awano]], [[Japan]].  An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. The bond strengthened after the 1997 flood devastated Grand Forks. Awano, a city of 10,000, sent $26,000 to help Grand Forks. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The most concrete evidence of the relationship between the two is a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an [[American bison]] in an Awano park.<ref>{{cite news  |last=Bakken|first=Ryan|title=Japanese Residents Will Dedicate New Garden|work=Grand Forks Herald| date=2003-10-21| url = | }}</ref> Awano is no longer a sister city, however, because it is no longer a city.  The nearby city of [[Kanuma, Tochigi|Kanuma]] recently annexed Awano, a smaller city. Kanuma city leaders say they already have a sister city in Australia and can't afford another one. The student exchange between the school districts is expected to continue.<ref>{{cite news| last = | first = | coauthors =  | title = GF's family gets smaller | work = Grand Forks Herald|date = 2006-02-19 | url = | }}</ref>

Grand Forks' relationship with [[Dickinson, North Dakota]] began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other. The Greater Grand Forks Convention and Visitors Bureau organized the exchange with its counterpart in Dickinson to showcase tourist attractions and improve cooperation in promoting statewide tourism. There's also a political component. Grand Forks Mayor [[Michael Brown (mayor)|Michael Brown]] has said he thinks having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, would help at the state legislature.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Davis  | first = Lisa | coauthors =  | title = Sister city delegates visit GF | work = Grand Forks Herald|date = 2003-10-19 | url = http://www.prairiepublic.org/features/riverwatch/news/herald/10_19_03.html | accessdate = 2007-06-05 }}</ref>

[[Sarpsborg]], [[Norway]] became a sister city in 2005 following several exchanges among leaders from both cities. Located southeast of [[Oslo, Norway|Oslo]], Sarpsborg is a city with a similar sized population to Grand Forks. The city became interested in building a relationship with Sarpsborg because many Grand Forks residents have Norweigan heritage.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Tran | first = Tu-Uyen | coauthors =  | title = Touring Norway: Year of anticipation | work = Grand Forks Herald |date = 2003-11-13 | url = http://www.grandforksherald.com/articles/index.cfm?id=37884 | accessdate =  }}</ref> The Grand Forks School District has announced plans to teach [[Norwegian language]] classes in the high schools, and a student exchange program began in 2007.<ref>{{cite news | last = Anderson  | first = Claire | coauthors =  | title = Touring Norway: Year of anticipation | work = Grand Forks Herald| date = 2007-05-15 | url = http://www.grandforksherald.com/articles/index.cfm?id=37884 | accessdate = 2007-06-05 }}</ref>
