The '''Blob''' ('''Frederick J. Dukes''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #3 ([[1964#January|January 1964]]).

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], the Blob claims to be unmovable. He possesses an extreme amount of pliable body mass, which grants him superhuman strength and his own [[gravitation|gravitational pull]]. Possessing the mindset of a bully, he mostly uses his powers for petty crime and as a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].

He is one of the most prominent, long-running mutants to be de-powered as a result of the ''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]'' storyline.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===

Born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], Fred J. Dukes starts out as a member of a [[circus]] [[sideshow]] under the name "the Blob". He is contacted by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], who tells him that he (Dukes) is a mutant, and asks him to join the X-Men. At the mansion, the other X-Men dislike Dukes for his obnoxious attitude. The Blob refuses Xavier's invitation, saying he is better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tries erasing his mind of what has transpired, the Blob escapes. He gathers up the other Circus members and they attack the mansion. Xavier is able to wipe everyone's minds, and the Blob goes back to the circus.<ref>''[[Uncanny_X-Men|X-Men]]'' #3)</ref>

===Joining the Brotherhood===

The mutant [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] seeks out the Blob to recruit him into his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], restoring his memory through a jarring blow to the head. The Blob temporarily accepts the invitation, but leaves when it is revealed that Magneto has no real concern for the Blob's safety

He later winds up in prison, but is freed by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] in order to recruit him into her incarnation of the Brotherhood.<ref>''X-Men'' #140</ref>  He becomes part of the plot to assassinate [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], the event which leads to the apocalyptic alternate future of ''[[Days of Future Past]]''.  He remains with the Brotherhood when it is reformed as the government-sponsored [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. After Freedom Force's dissolution, he participates in other versions of the Brotherhood, including one led by [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] and another led by Professor X; the Blob takes over as leader of the latter when Xavier leaves. 

The psychic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] later recruits Blob, vastly upgrading his powers and abillities. During this time the Blob fights various members of [[X-Force]] and is soundly defeated in each encounter.  Months later, Dukes joins the new Brotherhood led once again by Mystique, alongside Toad, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and the [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|daughter]] of the original [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].

When [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] recreates the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob offers to join but is quickly dismissed by Exodus, who considers him useless. This is a major blow to Dukes's already weak self-esteem, for which he seeks the counsel of therapist [[Sean Garrison (comics)|Sean Garrison]]. After a session, Blob attacks the Xavier Institute, though he is defeated by the combined efforts of the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]]. He is then arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

===M-Day===
[[Image:Blob-houseofM.PNG|thumb|150px|right|Blob discovering he's depowered in the [[House of M: The Day After]] One-Shot. Art by Scott Eaton. {{deletable image-caption}}]]
Due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s depowering of 90% of Earth's mutants, the Blob is one of the [[Decimation (comics)|thousands to lose their power]], though his epidermis does not shrink to compensate for his loss of mass, leaving him with huge folds of loose skin. The depressed Blob attempts to commit [[suicide]], but his skin folds prevent him from cutting through to any major blood vessels.

===Post M-Day===
Someone resembling the Blob is seen apprehended by the Thunderbolts,<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' vol. 1 #103</ref> but it is unknown whether it is Dukes, who later resurfaces as a member of the [[X-Cell]], a group of depowered mutants who attack Mutant Town in defiance of the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].

==Powers and abilities==

Before being depowered, the Blob's mutant physiology grants him a number of advantages. He has superhuman strength and great resistance to physical injury. The Blob's elastic, blubbery skin has proven to be difficult to penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine's]] claws; though with sufficient force the claws can lacerate his flesh.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225</ref> On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] is sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. He can also alter his personal [[gravitation|gravity]] field to make himself virtually immovable, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he is standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #7</ref> and [[Strong Guy]] (powered-up near his limit by absorbing [[kinetic energy]]),<ref>''X-Factor'' vol.1, #107</ref> although [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #206</ref> Despite his morbidly obese appearance, the Blob's agility is that of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.

The Blob's superhuman strength has greatly increased over the years, in a manner similar to that of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. This improvement is said to be a result of his ongoing mutation.

The Blob is vulnerable to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth and ears do not have the same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee is able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream.  On another occasion, [[Sleepwalker_%28comics%29|Sleepwalker]] defeats the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain.  Dukes can be incapacitated by drinking alcohol, although due to his immense mass, it requires a great amount.

==Other versions==

===''Age of Apocalypse''===
Blob appears briefly in the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' as one of Beast's experiments.  [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] kills him.

===''Cable & Deadpool''===
[[Cable & Deadpool|Deadpool's search for Cable]] across alternate timelines forces an encounter with the Blob of "an age of Apocalypse" (not to be confused with the [[Age of Apocalypse|X-Men story arc of the same name]]). In this reality, Blob has taken the mantle of Famine, one of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse#Other versions|Horsemen of Apocalypse]].<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #15</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
Blob appears twice in the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe. He is alive when first encountered, but being pursued by several zombie versions of Marvel characters, including Pyro and Toad. Later, he is revealed to have been similarly transformed, fighting alongside [[zombified]] members of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].

===Ultimate Blob===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], Blob is a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. His powers are similar to that of his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, although he has been moved by a helicopter during the ''[[Weapon X]]'' saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a model/physicist named Naomi, who [[Cybersex|cyber-seduces]] the X-Man [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] â€” leading to the discovery of Magneto's survival and, eventually, to the ''[[Ultimate War]]'' saga.  Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Ultimate version of Blob has threatened to eat his enemies.

===Amalgam Comics===

In [[Amalgam Comics]], the Blob is combined with [[Stompa]] to form Blobba, and with [[Chunk (comics)|Chunk]] to form Blob.

==In other media==
===Television===
*The "massive, immovable Blob" makes a brief appearance in the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' episode "The Prison Plot", when Magneto tries to free him from prison.  
[[Image:Blob.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Blob from [[X-Men: Evolution]] {{deletable image-caption}}]]
*The Blob appears in the 1989 animated pilot ''[[Pryde of the X-Men|X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men]]''.

*A teenage version of the Blob is a regular character in the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]). He is a bully and classmate of the X-Men prior to joining [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s Brotherhood.

===Video games===
*The Blob is the Stage 2 Boss in the 1992 [[X-Men (arcade game)|''X-Men'' arcade game]], loosely based on ''Pryde of the X-Men'' (see [[Blob_(comics)#Television|above]]). He returns in stage 7 as the first of five sub-bosses inside Avalon, in Asteroid M. It is here that he utters the memorable quote "Nothing moves the Blob!", which has been made into an [[List of Internet phenomena|internet meme]] by websites such as [[YTMND]] and [[Something Awful]].

===Films===
*The Blob was originally supposed to appear in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' movie, but didn't make it off the concept page. A hidden [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]] on the first ''X-Men'' DVD release (not ''X-Men 1.5'') shows concept art of the Blob & Beast.

*In the 2003 film ''[[X2: X-Men United]]'', the name "Dukes, Fred" appears on a list of mutants which [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] scrolls through on Stryker's computer while looking for Magneto's file.
