'''''Final Fantasy XII'''''{{nihongo||ファイナルファンタジーXII|Fainaru Fantajī Tuerubu}} is a [[console role-playing game]] produced by [[Square Enix]] for the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] [[video game console]]. The game was released on [[March 16]], [[2006]], in [[Japan]] and on [[October 31]], [[2006]], in [[North America]].<ref name="esrb">{{cite web | author=| year=June 28, 2006| title=FINAL FANTASY XII IN STORES OCTOBER 31, 2006| format= | work=square-enix.com | url=http://www.square-enix.com/na/company/press/2006/0628/ | accessdate=2006-08-13}}</ref> The [[Europe]]an and [[Australia]]n releases are scheduled for release on [[February 15]], [[2007]].<ref name=FF12dated/> On [[November 15]], [[2005]], a [[game demo|playable demo]] of the game was shipped with the [[North America]]n release of ''[[Dragon Quest VIII]]''.

The story takes place in [[Ivalice]], where the empires of Archadia and Rozarria are waging a bitter war; caught in the middle is the kingdom of Dalmasca. When Archadia invades and occupies Dalmasca, Princess Ashe founds a resistance movement. During the struggle, she meets Vaan, a young adventurer who dreams of commanding an airship. They are quickly joined by a band of allies and together rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire.

To commemorate the release of ''Final Fantasy XII'', playable demos of the full English version were available at DigitalLife's Gaming Pavilion in [[New York]] on [[October 11]], [[2006]], a day dubbed "''Final Fantasy XII'' Gamer's Day".<ref>{{cite web | author=Jim Cordeira| year=September 13, 2006| title=Final Fantasy XII kicks off at DigitalLife| format= | work=Gaming-Age.com | url=http://www.gaming-age.com/news/2006/9/13-21 | accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref> Also, Square Enix gave fans the chance to [[cosplay]] as their favorite character from ''Final Fantasy XII''. Each person was asked to show Square Enix three photos of his or her costume for a chance to win a trip to New York and participate in the ''Final Fantasy XII'' Gamer's Day event.<ref name ="cosplay">{{cite web | author=Square Enix | year=September 14, 2006| title=Final Fantasy XII Cosplay Contest 2006| format= | work=Square-Enix.com | url=http://www.square-enix.com/na/news/2006/ff12-contest/ | accessdate=2006-09-14}}</ref>

In early October 2006, the North American version of the game was leaked out onto the [[Internet]] less than a month before the planned release date. Square Enix has apparently taken legal action against the pirates as sites hosting the files and [[BitTorrent|torrents]] are being removed.<ref name ="leak">{{cite web | author=1-Up | year=October 3, 2006| title=Pirates Claim US Final Fantasy XII Leaked| format= | work=1up.com | url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3154177 | accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref>

[[Tofu Records]] has released an abridged version of the [[Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack|''Final Fantasy XII'' soundtrack]]. The single disc release will contain 31 songs, including [[Angela Aki]]'s "[[Kiss Me Goodbye]]". The 31 songs represent the 31 days of October, which led up to the North American release.<ref name="Tofu Records Announce U.S Final Fantasy XII Soundtrack">{{cite web | author=IGN | year=October 16, 2006 | title=Twelve Days of Final Fantasy XII| url=http://music.ign.com/articles/739/739179p1.html | accessdate=2006-10-16}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
<!--

To all editors, remember that the purpose of this section is to give a general overview of gameplay, not document every possible action in the game. Good Point!

-->
[[Image:Final Fantasy XII JAP FF12.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A standard battle]]
[[Image:XIIbestiary.jpg|150px|right|thumb|In-game bestiary]]
Like previous games of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, combat is [[menu (computing)|menu]]-driven. Combat unfolds in real time, using a new battle system called ''active dimension battle'' (ADB). The player may assume control of any of the three characters in the battle party at will and issue commands for the characters at any time. Battle commands include ''Attack'', ''Magicks & Technicks'', ''Mist'', ''Gambits'', and ''Items''. The game also features a system of chain bonuses where the party will gain the chance to earn improved items or bonus healing and status changes if the party kills a particular type of monster multiple times in a row.

The in-game world map has returned, after being absent from ''Final Fantasy X'' and its sequel. ''Final Fantasy XII'' has three kinds of maps: The overall world map, a small in-screen map dubbed mini map and a terrain map accessible via the Select key.

[[Chocobo]]s are traditionally featured in many ''Final Fantasy'' titles. In ''Final Fantasy XII'', whenever a player rents a Chocobo (or decides to ride a yellow Chocobo out in the wilderness), he/she has a certain amount of time to make his/her travels through the wilderness. While on a Chocobo, enemies ignore the player. Once the time is fully depleted, the Chocobo departs for its stall in the city (or where you found it in the wilds) and the player is dismounted and left on foot.

The game also features an extended Clan Primer, a summarization of the player's progress which includes detailed descriptions of defeated enemies, a catalogue of wanted monsters, and other information. The Clan Primer is reminiscent of the encyclopedias featured in ''[[Vagrant Story]]'' and [[Jiminy Cricket]]'s journal in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, as well as the bestiaries present in the ''Final Fantasy I-VI'' re-releases.

===Battle system===
<!--

To all editors, remember that the purpose of this section is to give a general overview of gameplay, not document every possible action in the game.

-->
Battles are similar to those in ''Final Fantasy XI'', except the game allows for single-player control of multiple party members, resembling [[Final Fantasy X-2]] battle system. The battle menu can be accessed at any time. Unlike ''Final Fantasy XI'', there is a visible "Wait Time Gauge" which indicates the time until the next battle action to be performed. Wait time varies depending on the action and character stats. Battle lines connect the player to a target or to enemies targeting the player. These can be turned off via the game options menu. The Options menu also allows players to set battle speed and Wait/Active mode much like [[Final Fantasy X-2]]'s battle system setup.

"Random battles" have been eliminated, but monsters can still ambush players, resembling random encounters even though the position is fixed. However the transition into a separate battle screen present in previous Final Fantasy titles is completely absent. Enemies can now detect the party through several means and some enemies are more hostile towards the party than others. Some fiends can also attack other monsters rather than the party.

A maximum of three party members can fight simultaneously. They are sometimes accompanied by a special guest character which cannot be designated as the party leader or controlled by the player in any way. When current party members is knocked out, the player may substitute them with the other inactive characters.

Another new feature in ''Final Fantasy XII'' is the Gambit system, which allows players to pre-program each character to react a certain way to incoming battle conditions without requiring player input. This makes leveling up and battling through large, monster-infested areas less taxing on players. This is a welcome feature, since the game requires a lot more leveling up between areas than many recent entries in the Final Fantasy series.  

[[Image:Mateus-ffxii.jpg|right|thumb|Mateus, one of the Espers in the game.]]
In a fashion similar to pre-existing Final Fantasy mythos, a mysterious phenomenon known as "Mist" exists in the world. It is the key energy which fuels two special abilities in the game: Summon magic and "Quickenings". Similar to Mako / Materia in ''Final Fantasy VII'' and to Pyreflies in ''Final Fantasy X'', Mist also plays a role in creating or mutating monsters.{{fact}}

[[Magic in the Final Fantasy series#Summoning Magic|Summoning magic]] appears once more with creatures known as Espers. To acquire an Esper, the creature must first be defeated in battle. Similar to ''Final Fantasy X'', summon spells become active participants in battle; however, unlike ''Final Fantasy X'', Espers are controlled by artificial intelligence instead of the player. The summoner remains an active member in the fight, instead of leaving the party or standing idle while the summoned creature fights alone. There are limits, however, to how long the esper can remain active. It will leave the party if the summoner gets knocked out, the time limit is reached, it unleashes its special attack, or the Esper loses all its hit points.  The player can use curative magic and status protections and all his items to aid the Esper.

While these have replaced the traditional ''Final Fantasy'' summons, it may be noted that many of these Espers have origins in the two installments of the Final Fantasy Tactics series, as either Zodiac Braves (in ''Final Fantasy Tactics'') or Totema (in ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance''). Other Espers have originated from the final bosses of the first five series of ''Final Fantasy''. However, ''Final Fantasy XII'' does feature several [[List of Final Fantasy airships|airships]] bearing the names of summoned beasts from previous games of the series, including Alexander, Shiva, Ifrit, Bahamut and Leviathan. Small ships are named after other Final Fantasy monsters like the [[Antlion]] and [[Tonberry]].

[[Image:Vlcsnap-597738.png|thumb|left|Vaan performs a Quickening]]
Like the last several installments in the series, ''Final Fantasy XII'' introduces a new [[Limit Break]] system: '''Quickenings''' (''Mist Knacks'' in the Japanese version of the game). Characters learn Quickenings by progressing to specific panels on the License Board. Each character can learn a total of three Quickenings, which are unique to each character. Characters can string together Quickenings into large combo attacks, dealing heavy damage. This is often referred to as mist chaining. If a mist chain reaches a certain number of attacks, a final strike will be initiated at the end of the Quickening cycle. This is called a Concurrence and can deal massive amounts of damage not only to the targeted enemy, but any nearby enemies as well.

===License system===
<!--

To all editors, remember that the purpose of this section is to give a general overview of gameplay, not document every possible action in the game.

-->
Learning and using abilities (magic spells, use of equipment, special skills, HP bonuses, etc.) is done via the new License system. Each playable character begins on a "License Board," which looks like an oddly shaped [[chess]] board. The panels on the board contain various abilities which the character may use. The board is split into two different parts.
[[Image:FFXII License Board.png|thumb|right|200px|The game's License Board]]

The upper part contains Magick, Technick, Accessory, and Augment (stat-raising) Licenses, while the bottom part is filled mostly with Weapon and Armor Licenses. In order to learn an ability or to be able to use a certain armor or weapon the character must first obtain a "License" for it, by spending the required amount of LP (License Points) to permit its use. LP are earned in battle along with the usual experience points.

While similar in some ways to ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'''s [[Final Fantasy X#Sphere Grid|Sphere Grid]], the License Board allows far more freedom; there are few restrictions on how the player may develop their characters (though this also allows the player to choose to make their characters completely the same, save for Quickenings). All characters may obtain any license on the board with the exception of Quickenings and Esper Licenses which may be activated by only a single character. In practice, the License Board system is simply another in a long line of systems where ability points are earned and exchanged for new abilities.

The [[Final Fantasy magic|magic system]] is divided into five different schools. White magic includes spells that heal the party's HP, cure status ailments and revive KO'ed party members. Green magic consists of supportive or debilitating spells that alter party members or enemies' statistics. Time magic includes spells that alter the target's speed, cause damage over time, or change the laws of surrounding space to help allies. Black magic consists of destructive spells such as fire and blizzard. The fifth and last school of magic is arcane magic, which includes spells such as Confusion. As in many previous titles, magic spells are bought from shops, but the character must obtain the appropriate ability on the License Board before a spell can be used.

The playable characters can equip any weapon in the party's inventory so long as they have acquired the corresponding license on their License Board. Depending on what category a weapon falls into (e.g. swords, two-handed staffs), the game may use a different method to calculate the damage that weapon deals.

===Gambit system===
<!--

To all editors, remember that the purpose of this section is to give a general overview of gameplay, not document every possible action in the game.

-->
[[Image:Gambits-ffxii.jpg|thumb|left|The Gambit screen]]
The Gambit system is a new type of party control system which allows the player to program each character to perform certain commands in battle automatically when specified conditions are met. Using Gambits, a player is able to set reactions to different stimuli for each character. Each Gambit consists of three parts: a target, an action and a priority. The target specifies which ally or foe to act on and the condition for applying the action. For example, the target "Ally: HP < 70%" causes the character to target any ally whose HP has fallen below 70%. The action is the command to be performed on the target. The priority determines which Gambit to perform when multiple Gambits would apply.

For example, a character may have two Gambits assigned: "Foe: Party Leader's Target: Attack" and "Ally: HP < 70%: Cure". The first Gambit causes him to attack the party leader's target, so long as it exists. Otherwise, if an ally falls below 70% health, the second Gambit will be performed to Cure the ally. If the priorities were reversed in the above Gambits, he would cease his attack and cast Cure if any party member's hit points fell below 70% and then resume attacking the leader's target (if any).

There are many different Gambit targets in the game to facilitate choosing any specific ally or foe, and then performing any action available to the character. Each character begins with two Gambit slots, and a maximum of twelve slots are available, after being unlocked on the License Board. Additional Gambit targets are most often bought in Gambit shops, but they can also be found in chests.

===Loot===
<!--

To all editors, remember that the purpose of this section is to give a general overview of gameplay, not document every possible action in the game.

-->
''Final Fantasy XII'' is also the second ''Final Fantasy'' to largely do away with fiends carrying and dropping [[Final Fantasy items#Currency|Gil]], the currency of the ''Final Fantasy'' world. Some monsters drop Gil in small quantities, though it is more commonly procured in other ways. Enemies in the game drop "loot", which can be sold for Gil at vendors around Ivalice. Selling more types, quantities and combinations of loot also opens up a new Bazaar option in shops, which will make available special bundles of goods for sale at a lower than usual price.

This also marks the first ''Final Fantasy'' where treasures are random. Chests, their contents, and their spawning on the field are all randomized between a small set of possible items, Gil, or rare items.

===Setting===
{{main|Ivalice}}
The story of ''Final Fantasy XII'' is set in [[Ivalice]], in an age where "magic was commonplace" and "airships plied the skies, crowding out the heavens". At this time, the use of magicite, a magic-rich mineral, is common and widely utilized in magic spells<ref>Sage Knowledge 12 of 78 (Hybrid Gator Bestiary entry) Magicite - Common name for stones containing magickal power, or as it is commonly manifest, Mist. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square-Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> and in the powering of airships -- a popular form of transportation in Ivalice.<ref>Sage Knowledge 14 of 78 (Steeling Bestiary entry) Airships - Currently, they are one of the most popular forms of transportation in Ivalice. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square-Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Ivalice is divided between three continents:<ref name="sleipnir"> Sage Knowledge 29 of 78 (Sleipnir Bestiary entry)<br>Ivalice - The region consisting of the three continents of Valendia, Ordalia, and Kerwon, blessed throughout with verdant natural landscapes and climatic conditions supporting a great variety of life. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Ordalia, Valendia, and Kerwon. Ordalia is located in the western part of Ivalice. The Rozarrian Empire makes its home in the vast inland plains on this continent, as the eastern portion of it is largely desert, or "jagd" -- lawless lands so rich in Mist (the ethereal manifestation of magicite) that airships may not fly over them.<ref>Sage Knowledge 30 of 78 (Urstrix Bestiary entry) Ordalia - Continent on the western edge of Ivalice. The vast plains in the interior are home to the great Rozarrian Empire.

Caught between the two powerful Empires are Dalmasca and other small nations and kingdoms that have fallen into subjugation to the Archadian forces two years prior to the game time.

The game consistently follows an Arabian theme. This theme is most prominent in the abstract decoration on the surfaces of Ivalice's architecture, an important factor in Islamic artwork and architecture. Within the games decorations of buildings and the interior of structures there are curving and often interlaced lines, of which the [[arabesque]] is a typical example, and the use of brilliant colors characterize almost all of the finest productions of Arabian style architecture, another example of this is the placement of [[minaret]]s on the temple within Mt. Bur-Omisace.

According to the game developers, design inspiration came from a mix of medieval [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Middle East]]ern countries. This is prominent throughout the architecture of the many Ivalice cities in-game, and the many races that populate the region.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hirohiko Niizumi| year=November 19, 2003| title=Final Fantasy XII gets star treatment in Tokyo| format= | work= | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/news.html?sid=6083932 | accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> The art team visited [[Turkey]], which influenced the game’s Mediterranean – style setting.

Phrases such as "Svagatam" (welcome) and titles like "Parijanah" (Guide) are lifted directly from Sanskrit. Some spelling such as "Sainikah" is imprecise when compared to standard spelling, but is still acceptable given pronunciation.

===Characters===
{{main|List of Final Fantasy XII characters}}
[[Image:Ff12cast.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cast of Final Fantasy XII]]
''Final Fantasy XII'' has six playable characters.

{{nihongo|'''Vaan'''<!--Do not add Ratsbane. It is a nickname, not a surname.-->|ヴァン|Van}} is a 17 year-old orphaned Hume street urchin who lost both his parents in a plague when he was twelve years old and his only brother, Reks, during the Archadian invasion of Dalmasca two years prior. He makes a living as the prosperous shopkeeper Migelo's assistant, running various errands, and as a cutpurse stealing from Archadian soldiers and citizens (stating that he is simply returning it to the Dalmascan people). He is cheerful, carefree, and energetic, and among his friends of many young orphans throughout Rabanastre, he is considered a leader. Vaan dreams of someday becoming a sky pirate with an airship of his own, free to go where he pleases. <ref>{{cite web | author=Stephen Coleman| year=August 1, 2005| title=Final Fantasy XII in Japan| format= | work=IGN | url=http://games.ign.com/articles/638/638166p1.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>

{{nihongo|'''Ashelia "Ashe" B'nargin Dalmasca'''|アーシェ・バナルガン・ダルマスカ|Āshe Banarugan Darumasuka}} is a determined and independent 19-year-old Hume princess fighting to liberate her kingdom, Dalmasca, from the Archadian Empire. In addition to being the leader of the Dalmascan resistance movement (under the pseudonym Amalia), she is the sole heir to the throne. Her father and eight brothers were killed during the Archadian invasion, along with her husband, Prince Rasler of Nabradia. Ashe seeks not only freedom for her country, but also vengeance against the Archadian invaders and the traitorous Dalmascan captain Basch, who assassinated the king at a treaty signing before the monarch could complete Dalmasca's conditional surrender. It was announced following the king's death that Ashe had taken her own life.

<!--Yes, "fon Ronsenburg" is correct. Please actually play the game and don't edit the name to the incorrect version.-->
{{nihongo|'''Basch fon Ronsenburg'''|バッシュ・フォン・ローゼンバーグ|Basshu fon Rōzenbāgu}} is a 36-year-old Hume who formerly served as a captain in the Dalmascan Order of Knights. After the defeat of the greatest part of Dalmasca's forces at the Battle of Nalbina Fortress, the King of Dalmasca sued for peace and was invited to sign a treaty at Nalbina. When the Order of Knights learned that the Archadians were setting a trap and planned to kill the king as soon as the treaty was signed, Basch and Captain Azelas Vossler led an assault on Nalbina Fortress to save their liege, only to be captured in the attempt. It is said that Basch slew the Dalmascan king , and as a result, he is regarded by the Dalmascans as a traitor and was said to have been executed.

{{nihongo|'''Balthier'''|バルフレア|Barufurea|'''Balflear''' in the original [[Japanese language]] version}} is a 22-year-old Hume sky pirate who pilots an airship named the ''Strahl'' around the skies of Ivalice. He and his Viera companion, Fran, prefer to remain outside of the war between the kingdoms of Ivalice. He appears at first wielding a gun, and constantly guiding Vaan in the young man's course to becoming a full-fledged sky pirate.

{{nihongo|'''Fran'''|フラン|Furan}} is a member of the rabbit-like Viera race and is also Balthier's partner aboard his airship, helping with its upkeep and maintenance. She forsook her home in the Woods many years ago to live among the Humes and as a result is a bit of an outcast from her race. Although her preferred weapon is the bow and arrow, she is also quite competent with a variety of other weapons.  Fran is the only non-Hume (human) character of the main cast.

{{nihongo|'''Penelo'''|パンネロ|Pannero}} is a 17 year-old Hume orphan who works in the Rabanastre bazaar and other various shops under the guardianship of the prosperous Bangaa merchant Migelo, a friend of her parents who took her in after they died. She lost her brothers in the war with the Archadian Empire, but she was adequately trained to fight before her brothers died. She had been with Vaan ever since his family died in the plague before the war, and eventually accompanies him in their journey to keep an eye on him.

''Final Fantasy XII'' centers around Dalmasca, a small kingdom in [[Ivalice]]. A neutral party in the past wars between its neighboring empires of Archadia and Rozarria, Dalmasca is ultimately conquered by Archadia and reduced to the status of an occupied state under Archadian rule.

Vaan, a street urchin living in the Dalmascan capital of Rabanastre, attempts to steal from the royal palace, in an attempt to "take back" Dalmascan treasures from the Archadians. However, resistance forces lead an assault on the royal castle, and Vaan is caught between Archadian troops and Dalmascan insurgents. 

During the assault, Vaan meets Balthier, a sky pirate, and Fran, his viera partner. They infiltrated the castle seeking an heirloom that belonged to the Dalmascan royal family, the Goddess' Magicite - ironically, it is what Vaan chooses to steal. Upon refusing to give up the Magicite, Vaan flees, and the pirates pursue. After an accident with Fran's flying motorbike, the three wind up in the sewers far below. This leads to a chance encounter with Ashe, the deposed princess of Dalmasca and leader of the resistance movement, who had supposedly committed suicide two years previous, when Archadia took Dalmasca. She assumes the alias "Amalia". Soon, they are captured by the imperial consort leader from Archadia, Vayne. Vaan, Fran, and Balthier are sent to Nalbina as prisoners.

The trio manage to fight their way out of Nalbina only to meet up with Basch fon Ronsenburg, the traitor who supposedly killed the king and Reks, Vaan's elder brother. Though Basch maintains he is innocent, Vaan still holds a grudge against him. Fran breaks him free of his cage and they narrowly escape from the prison. Upon their return to Rabanastre, they learn that Vaan's friend, Penelo, is missing. She was kidnapped by bounty hunters pursuing Balthier, intending to use her as bait to draw him to them into Bhujerba. Vaan bribes Balthier to attempt a rescue using his ship, the ''Strahl'', in exchange for the Goddess' Magicite. 

It is during this rescue mission they meet a boy named Lamont, who reveals some information about Nethicite, a stone similar to Magicite. Unlike regular Magicite, Nethicite absorbs magical energy.

The remainder of the story deals with the newly-formed party attempting to stop the imperial occupation of Dalmasca, and realizing that something far greater is indeed at stake.

Archadian Judge Magisters, leaders of the Judges who first appeared in ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'', are featured prominently in the story. They are the supreme enforcers of Archadian law, but only five become central to the overall plot: Judge Gabranth, Judge Ghis, Judge Drace, Judge Zargabaath, and Judge Bergan.

==Development==
Developed from [[2001]] to [[2006]], ''Final Fantasy XII'' cost approximately 4 billion [[Japanese yen]] (about 35 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) {{reference needed}} to produce with a crew of more than one hundred people, most of them who worked on previous games of the series. Creator and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' veteran [[Yasumi Matsuno]], originally announced as [[Game producer|producer]] and [[Game director|director]], was forced to bow out of both roles midway through the creation of Final Fantasy XII due to health concerns. In his place, ''Final Fantasy'' series veteran, [[Hiroyuki Ito]], and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' veteran, [[Hiroshi Minagawa]], took over directorial duties; while another series veteran, [[Akitoshi Kawazu]], assumed the shared role of the [[executive producer]] with president [[Yoichi Wada]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Anoop Gantayat| year=August 1, 2005| title=Changes to Final Fantasy XII Staff| format= | work=IGN.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/638/638050p1.html | accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref> Matsuno remains credited for "Original Work/Scenario Plot/Supervision". Minagawa was also the visual designer and character texture supervisor for the game. [[Kazutoyo Maehiro]], another veteran of the ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' series and ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', worked on the game as the battle system designer. [[Daisuke Watanabe]] and [[Miwa Shoda]] worked on the game as [[scenario]] writers. [[Akihiko Yoshida]], also a veteran of the ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' series and ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', worked as the main character designer and background design supervisor. [[Yoshitaka Amano]], a long time series contributor and veteran, returned as the image illustrator and the title logo designer for the game. [[Hideo Minaba]], another series veteran, returned as the [[art director]] for the game along with newcomer [[Isamu Kamikokuryo]]. [[Eiji Fujii]], who previously worked on ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', also worked on the game as the movie director. [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]], another veteran of ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' and ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', was the music [[video game music|composer]] and producer for the game, and main series veteran composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] contributed one new composition — the vocal theme, "[[Kiss Me Good-Bye]]", performed by [[Angela Aki]], who also wrote the lyrics. Renowned [[violinist]] [[Taro Hakase]] provided performances for ''Symphonic Poem "Hope"'', which served as a promotional theme along with "Kiss Me Good-Bye".

In early stages of development, the main character was to be "big and tough", but as development continued and targeting demographics were considered, he became more effeminate. With the casting of [[dorama]] actor [[Kouhei Takeda]] for the voice acting and [[motion capture]], he became less so and more "active, upbeat bright and positive".<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN Staff| year=November 20, 2003| title=Final Fantasy XII Q&A| format= | work=IGN.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441293p1.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>

Veteran translator [[Alexander O. Smith]] was involved with the English localization of the script as producer and translator. Smith had previously worked on the localization for ''[[Vagrant Story]]'' as well as several other ''Final Fantasy'' installments. The English voices were casted and directed by [[Jack Fletcher]], who had previously directed the dubs for other ''Final Fantasy'' media as well. ''Final Fantasy XII'' is the 3rd game in the series to feature voice acting, the others being ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''. The English voices were dubbed and recorded at [[Studiopolis]] in [[Los Angeles]].

Square Enix officially released the game in [[North America]] on [[October 31]], [[2006]], with an [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rating of "Teen". For the North American release, a "Collector's Edition" was made available through [[GameStop]] and [[Electronics Boutique|EB Games]]. This edition includes the original game packaged in a metallic case along with a special bonus disc, which contains Final Fantasy XII developer interviews, an art gallery, four U.S. and Japanese trailers and a [[featurette]] entitled "History of Final Fantasy", which gives a brief overview of most released and upcoming Final Fantasy games up to the newest releases.

Changes to the North American version of the game include the addition of [[widescreen]] 16:9 ratio support and additional scenes that were left out of the original Japanese version due to Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization]] rating issues. <ref>{{cite web | author=Alfonso, Andrew| year=September 23, 2006| title=TGS 2006: Final Fantasy XII Dev Team Interview| format= | work=IGN.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/734/734868p1.html | accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Adams, David| year=June 28, 2006| title=Final Fantasy XII Gets U.S. Date| format= | work=IGN.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/715/715370p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-14}}</ref>
