'''Assassination''' is the targeted [[murder|killing]] of a high-profile person.<ref>[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=assassin Assassin] (from [[Wordnet]], [[Princeton University]])</ref> An added distinction between assassination and other forms of killing is that the ''assassin'' (one who performs an assassination) usually has an [[ideology|ideological]] or [[politics|political]] [[motivation]], though many assassins (especially those not part of an organization) also demonstrate [[insanity]].<!-- already HAS refs, see psychology --> Other motivations may be [[money]] ([[contract killing]]), [[revenge]], or a [[military operation]].  

The assassination [[Euphemism#Doublespeak|euphemism]] '''targeted killing''' (or '''extrajudicial punishment / execution''') is also used for the government-sanctioned killing of opponents.<ref name="ARIEL">''[http://www.washingtontimes.com/commentary/20040325-091452-7923r.htm Commentary: Targeted killing...]'' - [[Ariel Cohen|Cohen, Ariel]], ''[[Washington Post]]'', Thursday 25 March 2004</ref> 'Assassination' itself, along with terms such as '[[terrorism|terrorist]]' and '[[freedom fighter]]', may in this context be considered a [[loaded language|loaded term]], as it implies an act in which the proponents of such killings may consider them justified or even necessary.<ref name="ARIEL"/>

''Assassination'' may also be used as a form of ''[[hyperbole]]'', as in the phrase ''character assassination,'' meaning an attempt to impugn another's character, and thus kill, or "assassinate" his reputation and credibility.

==Etymology==

{{Main|Hashshashin}}
The term 'Assassin' derives from [[Hashshashin]],<ref>''American Speech'' - McCarthy, Kevin M.. Volume 48, pp. 77-83</ref>  a militant [[Ismaili]] Persian Muslim sect, active in the Northern parts of Iran (Alamout) from the eighth to the fourteenth centuries. This mystic [[secret society]] killed members of the [[Abbasid]] and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] élite for political and religious reasons.<ref>Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Cassell Illustrated, 2005. ISBN 978-1844034161</ref>

It is popularly believed that the assassins were under the influence of [[hashish]] and [[opium]] during their killings or during their indoctrination, and that ''assassin'' derives from ''hasishin'', the influence of the drugs. However, most Islamic scholars now think this unlikely, and favour the etymology of ''assassiyun'', meaning people who were faithful to the foundation (''assass'') of the Muslim faith.<ref>The Idler issue 41: The Quite Interesting Issue, Tom Hodgkinson (Ed.), Ebury Press 2008. ISBN 978-0-09-192301-3</ref> Another possibility is that they were named ''hassansin'', after their leader, [[Hassan-i-Sabah]]. ''Hashishinnya'' was a term used by Muslims and Mongolians to characterize this cult.

The earliest known literary use of the "assassination" is in ''[[The Tragedy of Macbeth]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (1605).<ref>"Assassination". Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford University Press, second edition, 1989</ref><ref>Inventing English: A Portable History of the Language, Seth Lerer, 2007</ref>

==Definition problem==
The definition of "assassination" varies among sources. ''The [[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines "to assassinate" thus:

:''... to [[murder]] [a prominent person] by surprise attack, as for political reasons'';<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=assassination Assassination] (from the [[American Heritage Dictionary]])</ref>
however, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'s definition is:

:''The action of assassinating; the taking the life of any one by treacherous violence, esp. by a hired emissary, or one who has taken upon him to execute the deed.''<ref>Cited from - "Assassination". [[Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford University Press, second edition, 1989.]]</ref>

There is dispute whether the term assassination should include killings wherein the primary motivation is attracting attention to a political cause, and wherein the victim is of secondary importance (and might be famous, but unrelated to the dispute, or even an unknown). This leads to a number of possible definitions - which may however not all apply in any specific case:

*the killing of someone ''by [[Betrayal|treacherous]] violence''
*the killing of someone ''in the public view'' (i.e. someone notable)
*the killing of someone ''for political, moral, or ideological reasons''

For the purposes of this article, the third definition predominates, even though the second is often used, and the first would often be found in colloquial use.

== Use in history ==

{{Main|History of assassination}}

===Ancient to medieval times===

Assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]], dating back at least as far as recorded history. [[Philip II of Macedon]], the father of [[Alexander the Great]], and [[Julius Caesar]] can be noted as famous victims. [[Emperors of Rome]] often met their end in this way, as did many of the [[Shia Imam]]s. The practice was also well-known in [[History of China|ancient China]]. An example of this is [[Jing Ke]]'s failed assassination of [[Qin Shi Huang]]. The [[History of India|ancient Indian]] military adviser [[Chanakya]] wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise ''[[Arthashastra]]''.

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[regicide]] was rare, but with the [[Renaissance]], [[tyrannicide]] – or assassination for personal or political reasons - became more common again. The reigns of French kings [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV,]] and [[William the Silent]] of the [[Netherlands]] ended with assassination.

===In modern history ===

As the world moved into the modern day, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves, and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the [[propaganda of the deed]]. In [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] alone, four emperors were assassinated within less than 200 years: [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], and [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].

[[Image:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives.png|right|thumbnail|[[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], artist's depiction from 1865. Assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]] on the right.]]

In the [[United States|U.S.]], four presidents, [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Abraham Lincoln]], [[James A. Garfield assassination|James Garfield]], [[William McKinley assassination|William McKinley]], and [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy]] died at the hands of assassins, while many other presidents survived attempts on their lives.

In [[Europe]] the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] by [[Serbia]]n [[nationalist]] [[insurgent]]s is blamed for igniting [[World War I]] after a succession of minor conflicts, while belligerents on both sides in [[World War II]] used operatives specifically trained for assassination. [[Reinhard Heydrich]] was killed by [[Czechs|Czech]] [[partisan]] killers, and knowledge from decoded transmissions allowed the U.S. to carry out [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|a targeted attack]], killing [[Japan]]ese [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] while he was travelling by [[airplane]]. [[Adolf Hitler]], meanwhile, was almost [[July 20 Plot|killed by his own officers]], and survived various attempts by other persons and organizations (such as [[Operation Foxley]], though this plan was never put into practice).

[[India]]'s "Father of the Nation", [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], was [[Assassination of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|shot to death]] on [[January 30]], [[1948]] by [[Nathuram Godse]], for what Godse perceived as his betrayal of the [[Hindu]] cause in attempting to seek [[peace]] between Hindus and [[Muslims]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/50664.stm BBC World: The life and death of Mahatma Gandhi] Retrieved on 2008-01-02</ref> In the [[Philippines]], [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], [[opposition]] leader and top critic of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], was shot dead by alleged assassin [[Rolando Galman]] as he arrived at [[Manila International Airport]] from a 3-year exile in the [[United States]], with the death sometimes hailed as the [[catalyst]] of the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that toppled Marcos' 20-year [[dictatorship]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

===Cold War and beyond===
{{See also|Cold War|War on Terrorism}}

During the [[Cold War]], there was a dramatic new increase in the number of political assassinations, likely due to the [[ideology|ideological]] polarization of most of the [[first world|First]] and [[Second world]]s, whose adherents were often more than willing to both justify and finance such killings.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} 

[[Liaquat Ali Khan]], the first [[Prime Minister]] of [[Pakistan]] was assassinated by [[Saad Akbar]], a lone assassin in 1951. Conspiracy theorists believe his conflict with certain members of the Pakistani military (Rawalpindi conspiracy) or suppression of [[Communist]]s and antagonism towards the [[Soviet Union]], were potential reasons for his assassination. 

The U.S. Senate Select Committee chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]] (the [[Church Committee]]) reported in 1975 that it had found "concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro from 1960 to 1965."<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0043a.htm Church Committee - Interim Report: Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders Part III.B, page 71] (from the 'history-matters.com' website. Accessed 2008-08-22.)</ref>

Most major powers were not long in repudiating Cold War assassination tactics, though many allege that this was merely a smokescreen for political benefit and that covert and illegal training of assassins continues today, with [[Russia]], [[Israel]], and other nations accused of still regularly engaging in such operations. In 1986, [[U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] (who survived an assassination attempt himself) ordered the [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]] air raid on [[Libya]] in which one of the primary targets was the home residence of Libyan ruler [[Muammar al-Gaddafi|Muammar Gaddafi]]. Gaddafi escaped unharmed; however, his adopted daughter [[Bombing of Libya (April 1986)#Casualties|Hanna]] was one of the civilian casualties.

In the [[Philippines]], the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] triggered the eventual downfall of the 20-year autocratic rule of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Aquino, a former [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] and a leading figure of the political opposition, was assassinated in 1983 at the [[Manila]] [[International Airport]] (now the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]) upon returning home from [[exile]]. His death thrust his widow, [[Corazon Aquino]], into the limelight and, ultimately, the presidency following the peaceful [[1986 EDSA Revolution]].

On [[December 8th]], [[1980]] in [[New York City]] former Beatle and Musician [[John Lennon]] was assassinated by a deranged fan Mark David Chapman. Some speculate Lennon was neutralized due to his out-spoken activism and political views. Nearly 20 years after Lennon's Assassination, former Beatle [[George Harrison]] had a assassination attempt on his life. On [[December 30]], [[1999]] Michael Abram broke into the Harrisons' home and stabbed George multiple times, ultimately puncturing his lung. Harrison would soon recover from the attack.

On [[August 17]], [[1988]] President of [[Pakistan]] Gen. M. [[Zia ul Haq]] died along with his staff and the American Ambassador to Pakistan when his [[C-130]] transport plane exploded in mid-air after taking off from [[Bahawalpur]] because of an on-board bomb. The CIA, KGB and Indian secret service RAW all have been implicated by various conspiracy theorists.{{Who|date=August 2008}} 

Various dictators around the world, such as [[Saddam Hussein]], have also used assassination to remove individual opponents, or to terrorize troublesome [[population]] groups.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} In return, in post-Saddam [[Iraq]], the Shiite-dominated government has used death squads to perform countless extrajudicial [[execution]]s of [[Sunni]] Iraqis, with some alleging that the death squads were trained by the U.S.<ref>''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6802629/site/newsweek "The Salvador Option" - The Pentagon may put Special-Forces-led assassination or kidnapping teams in Iraq]'' - ''[[Newsweek]]'', Friday 14 January 2005</ref><ref>''[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/04/eveningnews/main2064668.shtml CBS: Death Squads In Iraqi Hospitals]'' - ''[[CBS|CBS Evening News]]'', Wednesday 4 October 2006</ref><ref>''[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/01/1526201 Is the U.S. Training Iraqi Death Squads to Fight the Insurgency?]'' - ''[[Democracy Now]]'', Thursday, December 1st, 2005</ref> 

In [[India]], [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Ministers]] [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Rajiv Gandhi]] (neither of whom were related to [[Mohandas Gandhi]]), were assassinated in 1984 and 1991. The assassinations were linked to [[separatist]] movements in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and northern [[Sri Lanka]], respectively.

In [[Pakistan]], former prime minister and opposition leader [[Benazir Bhutto]] was [[Benazir Bhutto assassination|assassinated in 2007]], while in the process of running for re-election. Bhutto's assassination drew unanimous [[International reaction to the Benazir Bhutto assassination|condemnation]] from the international community.<ref>''Benazir Bhutto shot dead at suicide bombing of rally; 20 feared dead'' - ''[[The Canadian Press]]'', Thursday 27 December 2007</ref>

==Further reasons==
===As military doctrine===

Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused - [[Sun Tzu]], writing around 500 B.C., argued in favor of using assassination in his book ''[[The Art of War]]''. Nearly 2000 years later [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also argued assassination could be useful in his book ''[[The Prince]]''. In medieval times, an army and even a nation might be based upon and around a particularly strong, canny or charismatic leader, whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war. However, in modern warfare a soldier's mindset is generally considered to surround ideals far more than specific leaders, while command structures are more flexible in replacing officer losses. While the death of a popular or successful leader often has a detrimental effect on morale, the organisational system and the belief in a specific cause is usually strong enough to enable continued warfare. 

There is also the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will "[[martyr]]" a leader and support his cause (by showing the moral ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. There are a number of additional examples from [[World War II]] which show how assassination was used as a military tool at both tactical and strategic levels: 

*The American interception of [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's]] airplane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.

*The American perception that [[Otto Skorzeny|Skorzeny's]] [[commando]]s were planning to assassinate [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] played havoc with Eisenhower's personal plans for some time, though it did not affect the battle itself. Skorzeny later denied in an interview with the ''New York Times''{{Fact|date=February 2007}} that he had ever intended to assassinate Eisenhower during [[Operation Greif]] and he said that he could prove it.<ref name="Skor">''Commando Extraordinary'' - Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155</ref> 

*There was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German General [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as "The Desert Fox").<ref name="Skor"/>

Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:

*During the [[Vietnam War]], partly in response to [[Viet Cong]] assassinations of government leaders, the [[United States|USA]] engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and killed between 6,000 and 41,000 persons, with official 'targets' of 1,800 per month.<ref>''[http://www.serendipity.li/cia/operation_phoenix.htm CIA and Operation Phoenix in Vietnam]'' - McGehee, Ralph; from a [[usenet]] discussion citing numerous references, 19 February 1996</ref>

*From 1991 till 2006, Russia targeted the top commanders of the separatist groups they were fighting in [[Chechenya]], killing several of them (including [[Aslan Maskhadov]] and [[Shamil Basayev]])

*During World War II, underground factions sympathizing with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were known to assassinate rival underground leaders to ensure their chances of governing their nation upon liberation from the [[Axis powers|Axis]], as opposed to their rivals. Naturally, the reason given to the assassin would be that the rival leader was an Axis sympathizer.

*In the Global [[War on Terrorism]], American special operations forces and intelligence agencies employed [[Manhunt (Military)| manhunting]]<ref>[http://www.analyst-network.com/profile.php?user_id=408 George A. Crawford], ''[[Manhunting: Reversing the Polarity of Warfare]]'', 2008, ISBN 1-60441-332-8</ref> operations against key opponents and [[Al Qaeda]] terrorist leaders.

===As tool of insurgents===

Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause. 

The [[Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919-1921 assassinated many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit - [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] - for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the assassination of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920. 

This tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] (1969-present). Assassination of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] by bombing the Conservative Party Conference in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.

[[Basque people|Basque]] separatists [[ETA]] in [[Spain]] have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them, meaning that many needed armed police bodyguards. 

The [[Red Brigades]] in [[Italy]] carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in [[Germany]] in the 1970s and 1980s.

[[Middle East]]ern groups, such as the [[PLO]] and [[Hezbollah]], have all engaged in assassinations, though the higher intensity of armed conflict in the region compared to western Europe means that many of their actions are either better characterized as [[guerrilla]] operations or as random attacks on civilians - especially the technique of [[suicide bomb]]s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], assassinations were routinely carried out by communist insurgents against government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Diem]] regime to collapse before the US intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' - Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday 16 December 1970</ref>

===For money or gain=== 

Individually, too, people have often found reasons to arrange the deaths of others through paid intermediaries. One who kills with no political motive or group loyalty, ''only'' for money, is known as a [[Contract killing|hitman]], or contract killer. Note that by the definition accepted above, while such a killer is not, strictly speaking, an assassin, if the killing is ordered and financed towards a political end, then that killing must rightly be termed an assassination, and the hitman an assassin by extension.

Entire organizations have sometimes specialized in assassination as one of their services, to be gained for the right price. Besides the original [[hashshashin]], the [[ninja]] clans of [[Japan]] were rumored to perform assassinations, though it can be pointed out that most of what was ever known about the ninja was [[rumor]] and [[hearsay]]. 

In the [[United States]], [[Murder, Inc.]], an organization partnered to the [[Mafia]], was formed for the sole purpose of performing assassinations for organized crime. In [[Russia]], the ''vory'' (thieves), Russian organised crime syndicates, are often known to provide assassinations for the right price, as well as engaging in it themselves for their own purposes. A professional hitman is called "cleaner" in Russia; he is used to clean away the target. The Finnish as well as the Swedish underworld uses the word "[[torpedo]]" for a contract killer.

===For racist reasons=== 

Racist groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. In the [[United States]] in 1968 Afro-American Baptist minister and civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King]] was assassinated after having became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his work to end segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other non-violent means. Another black minister, [[Malcolm X]], was also assassinated.

== Targeted killing ==

The use of assassinations for political or military reasons by sovereign states is an extremely contentious subject, with opinions ranging from people considering it a legitimate form of defense, especially against non-state actors like terror groups, to people calling targeted killings [[state terrorism]] itself. Both those for and against targeted killings are also often faced with accusations of being clearly partisan to one side of the particular struggle discussed.

*'''Pro''': Various groups and individuals have supported assassinations such as those undertaken by Israel against opposed terror groups, claiming that the killing of people like [[Ahmed Yassin|Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] is justified due to the fact that people like him provide "both religious and political cover" (for terrorist groups to operate), and that the fact that they may not have been physically involved in such crimes does not reduce their role. However, even they sometimes question the tactical prudence of such actions, while arguing that the killings may produce leadership vacuums and disorganise their organisations.<ref>''[http://www.defenddemocracy.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=218872 The Targeted Killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]'' - Snow, Jonathan L., [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]] policy institute, [[Washington DC]], [[United States]], [[March 26]] [[2004]]</ref><ref name="HOV"/> They also oppose the use of the term assassination, as it denotes murder, where targeting such leaders is seen as a move in self-defence, and thus killing, but not a crime.<ref name="HOV">''[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/26/EDGK65QPC41.DTL Targeted killing is a necessary option]'' - Sofaer, Abraham D., [[Hoover Institution]], Friday 26 March 2004</ref> Some even argue that targeted killing should be continued for '[[retribution]] and [[revenge]]', even though they accept that the killing has little effect on the number and severity of terrorist attacks, or may even increase them in the short and mid-term.<ref>''[http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/david.pdf Fatal Choices: Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing]'' - David, Steven R. ; [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[United States]], 2002</ref> 

*'''Contra''': Criticism of targeted killings focuses on a number of aspects, from being claimed to be against [[international law]] to being destabilising to local situations and thus causing more violence,<ref>''[http://en.epochtimes.com/news/4-4-18/20983.html Israel's Targeted Killings Threaten Peace in Entire Region, say Arab Leaders]'' - ''[[Epoch Times]]'', 18 April 2004</ref> an opinion also held by such intermediaries as [[Álvaro de Soto]], former [[United Nations|UN]] Middle East peace envoy.<ref>''[http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2006-03/07/article02.shtml Palestinian PM-designate Not Immune: Mofaz]'' - 'Islam Online' website</ref> Criticism often also focuses on innocent victims of the more heavy-handed or failed targeted killings, in which civilians have sometimes died in large numbers, such as during aerial attacks on terrorist leaders.<ref>''[http://www.mediamonitors.net/mosaddeq22.html Israeli Terrorism doesn't make News]'' - Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, Media Monitors Network, 02 December 2001</ref><ref name="LOGICISRAEL"/>

Targeted killings are also sometimes called '[[extrajudicial punishment]]',<ref name="LOGICISRAEL">[http://www.meforum.org/article/515 The Logic of Israel's Targeted Killing]'' - Luft, Gale; ''Middle East Quarterly'', Volume X: Number 1, Winter 2003</ref> though some states require some form of judicial trial [[in absentia]] before such an undertaking.

==Psychology==

A major study about assassination attempts in the US in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.<ref name="SS"/>

However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This incidentally shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two thirds of the attackers had previously been arrested for (not necessarily related) offenses, that around 44% had a history of serious [[depression (mood)|depression]], and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.<ref name="SS"/>

==Techniques==
===Ancient methods===

It seems likely that the first assassinations would have been direct and simple: [[stabbing]], [[strangle|strangling]] or [[bludgeon]]ing. Substantial planning or coordination would rarely have been involved, as tribal groups were too small, and the connection to the leaders too close. As [[civilization]] took root, however, leaders began to have greater importance, and become more detached from the groups they ruled. This would have brought planning, subterfuge and weapons into successful assassination plans.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

The key technique was likely [[infiltration]], with the actual assassination by stabbing, smothering or strangulation. [[Poison]]s also started to be used in many forms. [[Death cap]] mushrooms and similar plants became a traditional choice of assassins especially if they could not be perceived as poisonous by taste, and the symptoms of the poisoning did not show until after some time.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In ancient Rome, paid mobs were sometimes used to beat political enemies to death.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

===Modern methods===

With the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. Bodyguards were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances for an assassin's survival. It is considered that [[William the Silent]] of the [[Netherlands]] was the first leader assassinated by firearms ([[July 10]], [[1584]]).

[[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch; for an example, the [[Gunpowder Plot]] could have 'assassinated' almost a thousand people had it not been foiled.

Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine|landmines]] also used, especially in the [[Middle East]] and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG) has became a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles for assassination,<ref>''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' - [[CNN]], Saturday 17 April 2004</ref> as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

A [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, there are certain difficulties associated with long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive and hard to acquire, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.<ref name="Austria">''[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/13/wiran13.xml Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' - [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday 13 February 2007</ref>

Despite their comparative disadvantages, easy-to-acquire and hard-to-trace [[handgun]]s are much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the US in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, while 15% of the attempts used knives and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).<ref name="SS"/>

A 2006 case in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] concerned the [[Alexander Litvinenko poisoning|assassination of Alexander Litvinenko]] who was given a lethal dose of radioactive [[polonium]]-210, possibly passed to him in aerosol form sprayed directly onto his food. Litvinenko, a former [[KGB]] agent, had been granted asylum in the UK in 2000 after citing persecution in [[Russia]]. Shortly before his death he issued a statement accusing [[Vladimir Putin]], who was the [[Russian president]] at the time, of involvement in his assassination. President Putin denies he had any part in Litvinenko's death.<ref>''[http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1241951,00.html Putin 'Deplores' Spy Death]'' - [[Sky News]] Friday 24 November 2006</ref>

==Counter-measures==
===Early forms===

One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins is without doubt the [[bodyguard]]. He acts as a shield for the potential target, keeps lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a planned tour), and is literally supposed to put himself 'in harm's way' - both by his simple presence, forming a barrier in front of the target<ref name="SS">''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study]'' - Fein, Robert A. & Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999</ref><ref>[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] - Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> and by shielding the target during any attack. He is also, if possible, to neutralize an attacker as fast as possible, and thus often carries weapons (where legal or possible). 

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading to attempts by subterfuge, such as poison (which was answered by the [[food taster]]).

Notable examples of bodyguards would include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|janissaries]] - although, in both cases, it should be noted that the protectors often became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage at their whim or eliminating threatening leaders altogether. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties leads to assassinations such as that of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.

===Modern strategies===

With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a [[brigade|small army]] trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence of assassins and their capabilities skyrocketed, and so did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored car]]s or [[armored limousine]]s were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions rendering them virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire and smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].<ref>''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars]'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)</ref> [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, though they were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected - as such they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restrictive;<ref name="Report">[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] - Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as [[communication]] became better and [[information technology]] more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detector]]s. 

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during [[transport]], both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with US [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Patrice Lumumba]] and likely [[Salvador Allende]].<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554059/Allende_Gossens_Salvador.html Salvador Allende Gossens] (biography from the [[Encarta]] website)</ref>

The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] (built following an extremist's attempt at his life). Politicians themselves often resent this need for separation - which has at times caused tragedy when they sent their bodyguards from their side for personal or publicity reasons, as U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did during the public reception at which he was assassinated.<ref name="Report"/>

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as [[writer]] [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], a person built similar to the person he is expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], as well as in some cases [[surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations. Saddam Hussein is known to have used body doubles.<ref name="FOX">''[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html It's Bin Laden ... or Is It?]'' - [[Fox News]], Thursday 20 December 2001</ref> According to Joe R. Reeder, a former under secretary for the U.S. Army from 1993-1997 writing in [[Fox News]], [[Fidel Castro]] had also used body doubles, though no details were specified.<ref name="FOX"/>

In the final analysis, countermeasures can never be fully effective. If the assassin is committed beyond reason (i.e. [[insanity|insane]]) or without concern for his own for self-preservation ([[suicide attack]]er), then the task of protecting a person will be made much more difficult.
