== History ==
The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney was the first Presbyterian school for girls, and the second Presbyterian school (after the now defunct [[Cooerwull Academy]] for boys' in 1882) established in the [[colony]] of New South Wales.<ref name="GHvii"/> 

===Foundation===
The school was founded with 39 girls, on [[30 January]] [[1888]], at "Fernlea", a fourteen-roomed gentleman's residence set in three [[acre]]s of ground at Victoria Street, [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], the current site of the Masonic Hospital. This establishment saw the culmination of five years work by a committee of the [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|General Assembly]] of the Presbyterian Church of N.S.W.<ref name="GH1">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p. 1-3| chapter = Genesis 1883-1887}} </ref>
[[Image:JohnMarden.jpg|right|thumb|150px|PLC's first Principal, Dr. John Marden]]
The decision to commence a Ladies' College was made in 1883 when the Assembly formed a special committee to investigate the establishment of Superior [[Boarding school|Boarding Schools]] for girls and boys. The church saw an urgency to provide Presbyterian education in the colony due to the growth in [[Roman Catholic]] [[secondary school]]s. Many expressed fear of the outcome of this growth with Rev. James Cameron stating: {{cquote|Presbyterians should take prompt action because the Popish party, seeing the want that was felt throughout the colony in regard to higher education, has stepped in to supply that want, and if Protestants did not look to the matter, the Roman Catholics would take advantage of them.<ref name="GH1"/>}} 

The New South Wales [[Scottish people|Scottish]] community had also expressed dissatisfaction with the educational options available to their [[children]]. The N.S.W Assembly was, however, also inspired to establish a Ladies' College by less worthy motives. For example, in the "rival" colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Presbyterians had had a Ladies' College since 1875, and so it was felt that N.S.W Presbyterians should also have one. Further, other [[Protestant]] denominations had Ladies' Colleges, therefore the Presbyterians should have one too.<ref name="GH1"/> 

By July 1887, the committee had purchased the Ashfield property and [[advertised]] far and wide for an appropriate [[Principal (school)|principal]]. They unanimously selected [[John Marden|Dr. John Marden]], a [[science]] master from the [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], "because of his high academic standing, his experience and success in teaching and his high Christian character".<ref name="GH9">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p. 9| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref> Marden was a strong believer in [[equal opportunity]] in education, and has been described as an "early feminist" and "truly a man before his time". He was once quoted as saying: {{cquote2|I am out of sympathy with the cry that education is unnecessary for girls and that all they require is a few accomplishments. Women have also to live their life - in most cases a harder one than men have.<ref name="SMH1988">{{cite news| title = The Girls of PLC have made history| url = http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=%22presbyterian+ladies+college%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=author&sf=headline&sf=text&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news880406_0250_8026| work = Northern Herald| publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald | page = 26| date = 1988-04-06| accessdate = 2007-09-12}}</ref>|John Marden}} 

By August 1888, the College had outgrown the Ashfield residence, which had always been considered a temporary home, and Council began discussing alternative sites in the nearby suburb of Croydon. On [[5 September]] [[1889]], Col. John Hay Goodlet told the council of "Shubra Hall", the home of [[Anthony Horderns|Anthony Hordern III]] at Croydon, and urged Council to purchase it. Subsequently, the property was purchased on 26 October for Â£7,500. Plans were promptly drawn up for the additional buildings required, and by the beginning of the school year of 1891, the new site was complete and ready to commence furnishing as the permanent home of P.L.C.<ref name="GH30">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 30-31| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref> Marden consolidated the new school and, keenly interested in [[horticulture]], laid out beautiful [[garden]]s and [[playing field]]s.<ref name="ADBMarden">{{cite encyclopedia| last = Dougan| first = Alan | encyclopedia = Australian Dictionary of Biography| title = Marden, John (1855 - 1924)| url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100396b.htm?hilite=John%3BMarden| accessdate = 2007-08-10| year = 1986| publisher = Melbourne University Press| volume =10| location = Melbourne, Vic.| pages = pp. 407-408}}</ref>

''The Presbyterian'' reported of the opening of the College on 10 March, by the new [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor of N.S.W.]], the [[Victor Child-Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey|Rt. Hon. Victor Albert George, Earl of Jersey]] at its new site: 
{{cquote|Standing in six acres of ground, laid out in lawn tennis courts, gardens, etc., in an elevated position, it forms, with its tower 84&nbsp;ft high, a very conspicuous feature in the landscape. The central feature of the building is the tower, and the architectural design of the [[facade]] is classic. Altogether the effect is very imposing.

On the ground floor of the main building is a handsome [[hall]], the dining room capable of seating 80 persons, and the school-room. This room is lighted by three large [[bay window]]s of [[cathedral glass]], with stained panels at boarders. At the end of the school hall is a spacious [[corridor]], communicating with six [[classroom]]s. These are lofty, well lighted, and ventilated in the most approved fashion. Close to the classrooms are two lavatories, fitted with every convenience and sanitary appliance.
[[Image:PLC1891.jpg|frame|First students at Croydon|right|240px]]
At the side and rear of the main building are five music rooms, handsome landing, and wide corridors, extending the whole length of the building, giving access to 27 spacious [[Dormitory|dormitories]]. The bed furniture is of the simplest and most wholesome description - none but spring wire mattresses are used, with light horsehair mattresses only 2&nbsp;inches thick above. With this arrangement the maximum of cleanliness and comfort combined is secured.

There are six bathrooms, linen rooms, etc. The baths are fitted with shower, hot and cold water pipes and can be filled in three minutes. The lavatory and bathroom fittings are especially good, [[marble]] and [[Electroplating|electro-plate]] being freely used.

Many of the internal doors are of stained glass from the establishment of Messrs. Goodlet & Smith. The main staircase window is a work of art well worth seeing. The central window is beautifully designed, and contains two female figures representing [[Literature]] and [[Music]].

Among the [[portrait]]s on the two side windows are those of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Titian]] and [[John Milton]]. Some of the [[Fireplace mantel|mantelpieces]] are exquisite in workmanship, those in the dining hall being wrought in Italian Gariotte [[Marble]]. The ceilings are handsomely decorated in chaste colours, relieved with stencil flowers and gold [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]]. Every ceiling in the place is sound-proof.

At the very rear of the main building is a [[gymnasium]] and [[studio]] fitted with every modern appliance. It may be mentioned that very special provision is made for the safety of the building and of the inmates in case of fire.<ref name="GH30">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 30-36| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}} </ref>}}

The opening of the new buildings received wide publicity in the [[Newspaper|papers]] of March 1891. This was principally due to an [[Impromptu speaking|impromptu speech]] made by the [[Countess]] of Jersey, Margaret Child-Villiers, of which was considered a controversial and ground-breaking move, as it was most unusual for women to speak in public. Encouraged by her [[husband]], the Countess spoke of the opportunities available to girls at the college, the future role of Australian women, and the need for life-long learning. P.L.C's "Jersey Day", an annual event where [[Alumni|ex-students]] return to the college on the Sunday closest to 10 March, is named in the Countesses honour.<ref name="Jersey">{{Citation | title=Jersey Day and its Origin | newspaper=The Ex-students' Union News: The Annual Newsletter of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney Ex-students' Union| issue=75 | pages=1 | year=2006 | date=September 2006}}</ref>
[[Image:Croydon Shubra Hall PLC.JPG|200px|thumb|right|PLC "Main School" (built 1890)]]
By 1902, space had again become a problem due to increasing enrolments. Marden urged that new classrooms be built, which Council reluctantly agreed to. These buildings comprising six classrooms downstairs and eighteen rooms upstairs, were finished and handed over by the [[contractor]] on [[6 October]] [[1904]], at a cost of Â£2,000. This increase in enrolments also convinced Council of the need to set up a branch school on another site, preferably on the [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]]. A committee was set up in June 1907 to study the feasibility of a second school, yet recommendations were not considered by the Council. By 1913, space at the college was at a premium. Marden reported that many applications were being refused because of "shortness of space". This matter was taken to the [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|General Assembly]] of 1913, resulting in the approval of the establishment of a branch at [[Pymble, New South Wales|Pymble]] under the Council of P.L.C Sydney. The Council was given Â£5,000 to erect new buildings and lay out the grounds. "The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble" was opened on [[8 February]], [[1916]] with 48 day girls and 86 boarders.<ref name="GH30"/>
This school is still in existence, and is now known as "[[Pymble Ladies' College]]". The opening of the Pymble campus necessitated a change of name for the Croydon college, from "The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney" to '''The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon'''.<ref name="GH30"/>

The "Presbyterian Ladies' College, [[Beecroft, New South Wales|Beecroft]]" was established by P.L.C Sydney in 1924 with thirteen students. It was to serve as a [[Primary school|primary]] [[feeder school]] for the College, however it did not receive adequate attention from college council and was forced to close in 1929. This school was reopened in 1930 by the assistant teacher, Miss Gurney, who named it "Arden". The school flourished under Gurney's leadership and thus "[[Arden Anglican School]]" is still in existence today.<ref name="GH58">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 58-62| chapter = Reform Rejected 1920-1929}}</ref>

===World War Two===
1942 saw major upheaval and difficulties for the college. The new Principal, Dr. Helen Wilkie, arrived to find falling enrolments, staffing problems and food shortages due to the effects of the raging [[World War II|Second World War]]. The situation was made much worse as word was received that [[Australian military]] authorities wished to inspect the school with a view to taking it over. On [[24 March]] [[1942]], it was requested that the school be occupied by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] for the purpose of establishing a top secret [[Radar|Radar Unit]] and military [[barracks]]<ref name="GH89">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 89-98| chapter =War And Disruption 1942-1945}}</ref> known as No.1 RIMU (Radio Installation and Maintenance Unit).<ref name="Radar">{{Citation | last=Bellamy |first=Craig |publication-date=March 2007 |year=2007 |title=Tributes: Frank Cooper |periodical=Radar Returns: Signals & Echoes For RAAF Radar Veterans |publication-place=Hampton, Victoria |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=3 |url=http://www.radarreturns.net.au/assets/issues/rrvol12no1.pdf |accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> As a result, Council approached [[Meriden School]] in [[Strathfield, New South Wales|Strathfield]] to see if P.L.C could be accommodated there. Meriden kindly agreed to house the P.L.C boarders and to accommodate [[singing]], [[domestic science]], and [[physical education]] classes.<ref name="GH89"/>
Further, the school purchased "Lingwood", a property in Strathfield, as a centre for the schools remaining activities.
In spite of the apparent happy association with Meriden, Dr. Wilkie, recommended that further integration with the school should not proceed, and thus at the end of 1924, Meriden indicated that they would no longer house the P.L.C boarders.<ref name="GH89"/>

From here, P.L.C moved to "Lauriston" (now the primary school of [[Santa Sabina College]]) and "Welbeck", on The Boulevarde at Strathfield. In July 1944, the owners of Lingwood asked if the school was interested in buying the property. Council agreed to the purchase in order to use the house as a Kindergarten [[feeder school]] for the college, or as a site for a permanent move. A few months later, Council decided that the future of P.L.C lay in Strathfield and not in Croydon, and offered the Croydon campus to the [[military]] for Â£36,500. Plans were subsequently drawn up to purchase Welbeck and Lauriston to form the new P.L.C.<ref name="GH89"/> 

Council's wish for the school to stay in Strathfield was not shared by most,<ref name="GH89"/> with one student writing:
{{cquote2|I must go back to Croydon again, to the old grey tower and walls;<br>
And all I ask is the rising bell as it peels its lusty call;<br>
And the beds creak, and the blankets fly, and the cheerful faces beaming;<br>
And a mad rush to get a bath, and the bath taps steaming.<br>
I must go back to Croydon again, for the call of the old school bell;<br>
Is a loud call, a clear call, and a call that I know well;<br>
And all I ask is a windy day with the old flag flying;<br>
The chatter of cheerful voices, and the flag staff flying.<br>
I must go back to Croydon again, to that dear old school of ours;<br>
Where on the courts and in the pool I've spent many happy hours;<br>
And all I ask is the old school song as we stand in the dear old hall;<br>
And I pray that some day we may return to that dearest school of all.<ref name="Aurora1942">{{Citation | last=Levy | first=Peggy | title= | newspaper=Aurora Australis: The Magazine of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney | pages=3 | year=1942 | date=February 1942}}</ref>|Peggy Levy}}
[[Image:Strathfield Santa Maria Del Monte Lauriston.JPG|250px|thumb|right|"Lauriston", Part of P.L.C's war-time Strathfield Campus]]
In 1945, after intervention by the Education Trust of the N.S.W General Assembly, which had been investigating the future of the college, Council decided that the Strathfield proposal was not viable. It was agreed that P.L.C would reopen at Croydon in first [[Academic term|term]] 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive [[renovation]]s that were needed, with the final [[cheque]] handed over from the [[government]] on [[21 March]] [[1949]]. "Lauriston" and "Welbeck" were subsequently disposed of in 1946, however, the Lingwood property was retained as a [[preparatory school]]. Negotiations were entered into with Miss Margaret Thompson, the owner and principal of "Branxton", a [[private school]] in Homebush Road, Strathfield. It was agreed that Thompson would close her school and move it to the Lingwood property where it would retain the name "Branxton",{{Ref_label|b|b|none}} and come under the control of P.L.C Council. Branxton had an informal link to the College prior to 1946, as it had been founded by the [[sister]] of an ex-student, and many Branxton students had gone on to complete their [[high school]] education at P.L.C.<ref name="GH89"/>

Legacies of P.L.C's war-time occupation remain, with [[tunnel]]'s and [[bomb shelter]]'s accessible from below the [[stage]] of "College Hall". A [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] presented to the school by the RAAF in commemoration of P.L.C's war-time involvement, may be found at the entrance to the Main School, on the school [[Verandah]].

===Church Union===
In 1977, a [[Basis of Union (Uniting Church in Australia)|Union]] of the [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Methodist]] and Presbyterian Churches took place, forming the [[Uniting Church of Australia]]. Approximately half of the Presbyterian Church decided to remain Presbyterian and consequently the property of the Church had to be divided. In May of that year, it was announced that P.L.C Croydon was to remain Presbyterian and P.L.C Pymble would be transferred, and its name changed to "Pymble Ladies' College". Subsequently, in 1978 it was decided that P.L.C Croydon should return to its originally intended name of "The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney".<ref name="GH129">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p. 129| chapter =Preparation For Expansion 1977-1985}}</ref>

== Fees ==
As with all Australian independent schools, P.L.C is not a full fee paying institution, due to it receiving limited government funding; full fees only apply to international students, who are not subsidised by any government funding. For non-international students, 2007 fees range from [[Australian dollar|AUD$]]11,988 to AUD$18,656 per annum, and in excess of AUD$30,000 per annum for boarding students.<ref name=Fees07/>

P.L.C Sydney offers [[scholarship]]s and bursaries that provide all or part remission of tuition fees to students who are Australian citizens, Permanent Residents of Australia or refugees. Academic scholarships are based on the results of the ACER Scholarship Examination, and are typically offered from Year 7 onwards. In addition to those awarded for academic performance, P.L.C also offers music and boarding scholarships. Indigenous Bursary's are available for students of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] or [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] background, and are awarded following an interview with the Principal where the situation of the individual student and the family is considered.<ref name=Scholarships>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/scholarships.asp |title=Scholarships and Bursaries |accessdate=2007-12-26 |work=Enrolment |publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref>

The school [[Coat of arms|crest]] was adopted at a College Council meeting on [[23 August]] [[1888]]. It now forms the [[badge]] worn on the [[school uniform]]. The College Council decided to use the same crest as that used by the [[Presbyterian Church of New South Wales]], but with minor modifications.<ref name="GH298"/>

The Church's crest consisted of a [[shield]] with the words ''Nec Tamen Consumebatur'' (translated from [[Latin]] as "And yet it was not consumed")<ref name=PresbyterianChurch>{{Citation| year=2004 | title=An Introduction to the Presbyterian Church of Australia | place= Sydney | publisher=Code Committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Australia | volume=1 | pages=21 | url=http://www.presbyterian.org.au/PDF/AnIntroductiont%20thePCABooklet.pdf | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> surrounding it. This shield featured the [[star]]s of the [[Southern Cross]], a [[burning bush]], and in outline, a [[Latin cross]]. At the base were the [[floral emblem]]s of [[Scotland]], [[England]] and [[Ireland]]. Surrounding the shield was a border with the words "Presbyterian Church of New South Wales", with a [[Star of David]] placed on top. Behind both shield and borders was the [[Saint Andrew's Cross|cross of St. Andrew]] in blue.<ref name="GH298"/> 
[[Image:PLCCigaretteCard.jpg|thumb|150px|Collectable School Cigarette card featuring the P.L.C colours & crest, [[Circa|c.]] 1910's]]     
The School modified the crest by changing the words "Presbyterian Church of New South Wales" to "Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney", placing a [[Maltese cross]] at the top of the shield and inserting the School [[motto]] ''Sancte Sapienter''. This motto had been adopted by the school on [[23 August]] [[1888]] and although no [[translation]] was given of the Latin, it may be loosely translated to "be holy wisely" or "holy, wisely".<ref name="GH298"/> 

At [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, Presbyterian churches of the various Australian states also federated. The newly formed [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]] adopted the N.S.W crest, subsequently changing "New South Wales" to "Australia". In 1939 the General Assembly of Australia adopted a new crest: the star of David disappeared, the Latin cross was added and the floral emblems were redrawn with the thistle in centre position. These changes account for the differences between the school's and the Church's crest today.<ref name="GH298"/>

== School badge ==   
The school's highly [[symbolic]] [[badge]] was inspired by the first Principal, Dr. Marden and designed by the first art [[teacher]], Mr. J.A. Bennett in 1888. The [[maiden]] on the [[lion]] represents Knowledge, which is crowned by a [[tower]] representing the [[home]], and holding a [[trident]] representing [[Sovereignty]]. A [[laurel wreath]] represents the [[victory]] of true womanhood, whose crown is the home, over force. The [[sun]] symbolises [[light]] and [[energy]], while the [[crescent moon]] stands for [[youth]]. The words "Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney" surround the badge.<ref name="GH299"/> 
[[Image:PLCBadge.jpg|left|thumb|150px|PLC Sydney school badge]]
The motto ''All'Ultimo Lavoro'' comes from [[Dante]] and has variously been translated as: "for the crowning task", "strive for the highest", "the utmost for the highest", or "I work for the highest".<ref name="GH299"/>   
       
The badge is reproduced in the [[leadlight]] over the front door of the original house, "Shubra Hall".<ref name="GH299"/>
It may also be found on the recently opened "Ex-Students pathway".   
   
The school badge was traditionally worn as part of the uniform on the [[tam-o-shanter]], until it was phased out in 1995. The badge is currently not worn by most students, partially due to its adoption by Pymble Ladies' College as their school crest in 1977. It was however reintroduced in 2003 as an addition to the Beret of the P.L.C Pipes and Drums uniform.
The badge is also used by the college's [[Alumni association|ex-student's union]] as it has since 1905, with the addition of the words "Ex-students Union" below.

== College tartan ==   
The school has adopted as its school and [[Pipe band|Pipes and Drums]] uniform the [[Black Watch]] [[Tartan]] of the [[Royal Highland Regiment]]. P.L.C was granted permission to wear the tartan after its [[Sister school|brother school]], [[The Scots College]], were issued a [[royal decree]] allowing them to use Black Watch as their Pipes & Drums and [[Cadets]] uniform.   
  
This tartan was carefully chosen by the school, as the 1958 ''Aurora Australis'' (the school [[yearbook]]) explained: {{cquote2|the tartan of the Black Watch, the oldest of the highland regiments. This tartan was specially designed for the regiment to prevent the jealousy which would have been aroused, if any existing clan tartan had been used.<ref name="Aurora1958">{{Citation | title=Tartan of the Black Watch | newspaper=Aurora Australis: The Magazine of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney | year=1958}}</ref>}}

When the college first opened in 1888, there was no [[School uniform|uniform]], rather the girls wore long cotton dresses, gloves and hat. The early 20th century saw the introduction of a straw [[Boater (hat)|boater]], worn with a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its [[burning bush]] woven into it in red. [[Prefects]] during this time wore red [[silk]] arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.<ref name="GH309">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 309-311| chapter =The School Uniform}}</ref> 

The distinctive Black Watch Tartan of the college was introduced in 1918, following the issue of a royal decree. Senior girls wore heavy box-pleated skirts and white [[blouse]]'s, whilst junior girls wore [[pinafore]] dresses. All girls wore a navy [[blazer]] and heavy woollen stockings. Prefects at the time also wore a special hat badge with a ring of bright blue enamel. A black felt Breton was introduced for [[winter]] use, and no change was made until the introduction of the green beret in 1952.<ref name="GH309"/>
 
1966 saw the introduction of the current Year 11 and 12 uniform. This uniform was designed by the senior students of 1965 and consists of a Black Watch [[kilt]], white blouse (short sleeve in summer, long in winter), green [[blazer]], green [[Sweater|jumper]] or [[vest]], black [[stocking]]s for winter and bottle green knee-high socks for summer, and black leather lace-up shoes. Girls of [[Scotland|Scottish]] origin may wear the [[kilt pin]] representing their family or [[Scottish clan|clan]] name, rather than the standard school pin. A green and Black Watch [[tam-o-shanter]] (known as 'the [[Beret]]') was also introduced for all [[Grade (education)|grades]] a few years earlier.<ref name="GH309"/> 

1995 saw the phasing out of the school's distinctive 'Beret' as girls found it difficult to wear. This was replaced by the current [[Panama hat]]. The Beret was however reintroduced in 2003 as an addition to the [[Pipes and Drums]] uniform. 
[[Image:Plcuniform1950.jpg|thumb|200px|PLC students in uniform, 1950]]
The current junior (R-10) uniform was introduced in 1997. In [[summer]], girls are required to wear a Black Watch tunic, short-sleeve white blouse, green blazer with tartan piping, short green socks and black leather shoes. The [[winter]] uniform consists of the [[tunic]], long-sleeve white blouse, the blazer, green jumper or vest, Black Watch Tartan [[Necktie|tie]], Black Watch Tartan [[scarf]] and either green knee-high socks or black stockings.<ref name=BoardingHandbook>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public/boardinghousehandbook.pdf |title=Boarding House Handbook |accessdate=2007-06-21 |year=2006 |format=PDF |work=Boarding|publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref>

School 'pockets' are awarded for student achievements, and are [[Embroidery|embroidered]] in red on the pockets of junior blazers (R-10 girls), and white on the left-brest of senior blazers (11-12 girls). Green and Gold striped school blazers are awarded to girls who represent Australia in any event.

== Curriculum ==
The Presbyterian Ladies' College is a [[comprehensive school]] with an academic focus in the [[curriculum]], and takes a traditional academic approach designed to prepare students for [[university]].<ref name=Curriculum>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/curriculum.asp |title=Curriculum Overview |accessdate=2007-06-30 |work=Curriculum|publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College }}</ref> The school is registered and accredited with the [[Board of Studies|New South Wales Board of Studies]],<ref name=BoardofStudies>{{cite web |url=http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/ebos/static/AccredSchoolsP.htm |title=Non-Government Registered Schools List|accessdate=2007-10-29 |date =2007-10-18 |work= Letter P - Board of Studies NSW |publisher=New South Wales Government}}</ref> and therefore follows the mandated [[curriculum]] for all years.

In the final school stage ([[Year Eleven (School)|Years 11]] and 12) students are prepared for the New South Wales [[Higher School Certificate]] (HSC). The curriculum at this stage has a clear university orientation. 
The Board of Studies requires stage 6 students to study a minimum of 12 units in the Preliminary Year and 10 units in their HSC Year (with most subjects worth 2 units).

University entry levels are high following the completion of stage 6. Each year approximately 50% of P.L.C students receive a [[Universities Admission Index]] (UAI) over 90.<ref name=Prospectus>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/media/070524_prospectus.pdf |title=Prospectus |accessdate=2007-06-30 |format =PDF |work=Enrolment Enquiry|publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College }}</ref> In the 2006 Higher School Certificate, a P.L.C student received a perfect score with a UAI of 100,<ref name=IWCNJ>{{cite news| first = Leesa| last = Smith| title = Nikki notches a perfect result| url = http://www.villagevoice.com.au/article/20070117/NWS05/701170352&SearchID=73295770208658/Nikki+notches+a+perfect+result| work = Education| publisher = Inner Western Courier| date = 2007-01-18| accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> and the National Education Directory of Australia named P.L.C the best performing independent school in Sydney's Inner-West.<ref name=HSC>{{cite web |url=http://www.education.net.au/newsletter/hsc.pdf |title=Top HSC Schools by Region |accessdate=2007-08-09 |date =2006-12-21 |format =PDF |work=Albury to Newcastle|publisher=The National Education Directory of Australia}}</ref>

===Special education===
P.L.C also offers a unique [[special education]] unit catering to students with mild to moderate [[intellectual disabilities]]. The "transition program" was developed in 1992 in response to a decision by academic staff to provide a special-needs stream. Through this unit, up to 20 girls between the ages of 11 and 18 are provided with an individual program incorporating mainstream classes where possible.<ref name=Specialneeds>{{cite news| first = Perrie| last = Croshaw| title = Special needs met| url = http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=%22PLC+Sydney%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=10years&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=SMH0702086P6N71NB3U7| work = Supplement| publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald| page = p.2| date = 2007-02-08| accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref>

The senior transition program for older students focuses on the Board of Studies Life Skills program. As part of this program, girls spend time as residential students in the on-campus "Transition House", learning to self-cater and self-manage. Transition students also run an outdoor [[cafe]] as a [[small business]], in order to gain related business skills.<ref name=Specialneeds/>

== House system ==
The [[house system]] was established by [[John Marden|Dr. John Marden]] shortly after the opening of the school, and consisted of three houses: East, West and Boarders. In 1924, the senior houses were re-organised, and renamed Kinross, Harper and Ferguson (with Anderson added in 1968), and in 1926, the junior houses were named Vicars and [[Ewen Neil McQueen|McQueen]] (with Thompson added in 1937).<ref name="GH65">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 65&138}}</ref>  
1979 saw the school move to four houses from primary to secondary, and thus the junior houses Vicars, McQueen and Thompson disappeared.<ref name="GH65"/> 
Finally, 1995 saw the introduction of two new houses due to increasing enrolments. These were named Pickard and Wilkie.

The Houses are named after women and men who have made a significant contribution to the life of the College.

She was a foundation member of the Committee of the Ex-Students' Union in 1906. From 1927 until 1932, she served as President, then as Vice-President or Patroness from 1936. In 1932 she petitioned the Assembly for the regular appointment of women members to the P.L.C Council. Mrs Anderson was a member of the P.L.C Council, serving from 1932 to 1958. She was a generous benefactor to the College all her life. '''Colour''': <font color="#000080">Navy Blue</font> '''Mascot''': Ant '''Established''': 1968

== P.L.C Armidale alliance ==
In late August 2005, due to financial troubles at the [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Armidale]], it was announced that P.L.C Armidale and P.L.C Sydney would join together to form an [[alliance]]. The aim of this alliance is to strengthen P.L.C Armidale through cooperative [[marketing]], a change in [[management]] and a stronger financial base. It should also be of benefit to both schools through student exchanges, accommodation for sporting events or [[excursion]]s, and a 'country or city' option for prospective students.

In the September-October 2005 edition of the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales' ''Church Offices Newsletter'', the [[Chair (official)|Chairman]] of [[Trustee]]s, Jeof Falls, announced this alliance between the two schools:
{{cquote|Arising from a detailed strategic analysis of the school over the past six months and recommendations from some highly respected educational consultants, the Church has moved to strengthen P.L.C Armidale through modifying its governance structure so as to bring it under the executive leadership of...Dr William McKeith, who is the Principal of P.L.C Sydney.

This action was endorsed by the General Assembly in July. Members of the present P.L.C Armidale Council will form part of the new Council. Essentially, P.L.C Armidale and P.L.C Sydney will become true sister schools under the leadership of a united Council and an Executive Principal. P.L.C Armidale will also continue to have its own Head of School.

Both schools will retain their strong sense of independence, and will maintain their separate identities so as to recognise and preserve the unique relationships, histories and traditions that both have developed over many years in serving their respective communities.<ref name=pcnsw>{{Citation| last=Falls| first=Jeof| publication-date=September-October| year=2005| title=New Partnership between PLC Armidale and PLC Sydney| periodical=Church Offices Newsletter| publication-place=Surry Hills| publisher=The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales| issue=288| pages=3| url=http://pcnsw.org.au/LocalSite/pdf/newsletters/SepOct2005.pdf| accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref></blockquote>}}

==Ex-Students' Union==
'''The Ex-Students' Union''' was [[Inauguration|inaugurated]] on the evening of [[9 December]] [[1905]], when at the invitation of [[John Marden|Dr. Marden]], several former students discussed the proposal, elected as their [[President]] the then Lady [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]], Miss Marion Pickard, and formed a [[committee]] to produce a [[Constitution (corporate)|constitution]]. These were confirmed at a General Meeting on Jersey Day 1906, and the committee took [[Term of office|office]] until 1907. 
At its foundation, the main objective of the union was to:{{Ref_label|d|d|none}}{{cquote2|be the accumulation of a special fund to be devoted to the erection of a [[chapel]] and library at the College, and an Ex-Students' [[prize]] to be awarded annually to the girl most proficient in work and sport.<ref name="GH312">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 312-317| chapter =The Ex-Students' Union}}</ref>}}

The Union achieved much in its first few years, renting a building in the [[Sydney central business district|CBD]] to serve as a club and committee meeting place, making garments for [[hospital]]s, visiting [[Kindergarten]]s, the [[YWCA]], Home of Peace, Infants' Home and the [[Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children]]. An Ex-Students' [[Orchestra]] and Dramatic Club were formed, and [[Tennis]] and [[Croquet]] matches were held between current and former pupils.<ref name="GH312"/>

In 1916 the Pymble College was opened and its first Ex-Students' expressed an interest in joining the Union. Subsequently, a combined Union was formed, known as "The P.L.C Croydon and Pymble Ex-Students' Union", and an Ex-Students' prize was established at Pymble on the same conditions as at Croydon.<ref name="GH312"/>

One of the Unions' most significant contributions to the school was planned following the death of Dr. Marden in 1924. With the desire to provide Marden with a "fitting and lasting memorial", it was decided that a [[library]], to be called the "John Marden Memorial Library", should be built at the Croydon College. This building was opened by Mrs. Marden in 1927 and although no longer suitable as a library due its size, remains a treasured part of the school.<ref name="GH312"/>

In 1929, it was proposed that "Pymble students should form a separate Union" and that an equitable division of Union [[funds]] should be undertaken. This explains the two separate groups that exist today, however it is still not uncommon for Pymble students to attend Croydon [[reunion]]s and events, particularly those in regional areas or interstate.<ref name="GH312"/>

=== Notable alumnae ===
[[Alumnae]] of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney are commonly referred to as P.L.C Old Girls, and may elect to join the schools [[alumni association]], the P.L.C Ex-Students' Union. For a list of notable P.L.C Old Girls, see '''''[[List of Old Girls of PLC Sydney]]'''''.
