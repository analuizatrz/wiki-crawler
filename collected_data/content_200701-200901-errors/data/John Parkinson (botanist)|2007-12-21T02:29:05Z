'''John Parkinson''' ([[1567]]&ndash;[[1650]]; buried [[6 August]] [[1650]]) was the last of the great [[England|English]] [[herbalist]]s and one of the first of the great English [[Botany|botanists]]. He was [[apothecary]] to [[James I of England|James I]] and a founding member of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]] in December 1617, and was later Royal Botanist to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He is known for two monumental works, ''Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris'' (''Park-in-Sun's Terrestrial Paradise'', 1629), which generally describes the proper cultivation of plants; and ''Theatrum Botanicum'' (''The Botanical Theatre'' or ''Theatre of Plants'', 1640), the most complete and beautifully-presented English treatise on plants of its time. One of the most eminent gardeners of his day, he kept a botanical garden at [[Long Acre]] in [[Covent Garden]], today close to [[Trafalgar Square]], and maintained close relations with other important English and [[Mainland Europe|Continental]] botanists, herbalists and [[Plantsman|plantsmen]].

==Biography==
Parkinson, born in 1567, spent his early life in [[Yorkshire]]. He moved to London at the age of 14 years to become an apprentice [[apothecary]].<ref name="Telegraph: Christmas Reads">{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Tim|title=10 best Christmas reads: ''Nature's Alchemist: John Parkinson, Herbalist to Charles I'' by Anna Parkinson|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/main.jhtml?xml=/gardening/2007/11/30/garden-christmas-book130.xml&page=2|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (''Gardening'')|date=[[2007-12-01]]|page=G5}}</ref> Rising through the ranks, he eventually achieved the position of [[apothecary]] to [[James I of England|James I]], and a founding member of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]] in December 1617; until 1622 he also served on the Court of Assistants, the Society's governing body. In addition, he assisted the Society in obtaining a grant of [[Coat of arms|arms]] and in preparing a list of all medicines that should be stocked by an apothecary.<ref name="KCL">{{cite web|last=Cahill|first=Hugh|title=Book of the month : Paradisi in sole, paradisus terrestri|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/library/speccoll/bomarch/bomapril05.html|publisher=Information Services and Systems, [[King's College London]]|date=April 2005|accessdate=2007-11-30}}</ref> He was on the committee that published their ''Pharmacopœia Londinensis'' (''London [[Pharmacopoeia|Pharmacopœia]]'') in 1618.<ref>{{cite book|author=Medicorum Collegij Londinensis [College of Physicians of London]|authorlink=Royal College of Physicians|title=Pharmacopœia Londinensis in qua medicamenta antiqua et nova vsitatissima, sedulò collecta, accuratissimè examinata, quotidiana experientia confirmata describuntur.

Then, on the cusp of a new science, he was [[botanist]] to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who conferred on him the title "''Botanicus Regis Primarius''" ("Royal Botanist of the First Rank").<ref name="TAMU">{{cite web|author=Linh Tran|title=Theatrum Botanicum : The Theater of Plants, or, An Herbal of a Large Extent|url=http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/cushing/Parkin1.htm|publisher=[[Texas A&M University]] Bioinformatics Working Group|accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref> Anna Parkinson, a "distant descendant"<ref name="Telegraph: Christmas Reads"/> of Parkinson and the author of a new popular biography of him, asserts that in 1625 when Charles I's bride, [[Henrietta Maria of France]], came at the age of 15 years to live at [[St. James's Palace]], "he took on the role of introducing the young queen to [[Horticulture|horticulturally]] sophisticated circles."<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news|last=Parkinson|first=Anna|title=John Parkinson : An ancient alchemist's wisdom [print version: Unearthing an ancient alchemist's wisdom]|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/main.jhtml?xml=/gardening/2007/11/16/garden-parkinson116.xml|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (''Gardening'')|date=[[2007-11-17]]|page=G3}}</ref> When he summed up his experience in writing ''Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris'' (''Park-in-Sun's Terrestrial Paradise'', 1629 &ndash; "Park-in-Sun" is a pun on "Parkinson"), with the explanatory subtitle ''A Garden of all sorts of pleasant flowers which our English ayre will permit to be noursed up'', it was natural that he dedicated this work, which he called his "Speaking Garden",<ref name="KCL"/> to the queen.<ref name="Telegraph"/> Blanche Henrey called the work the "earliest important treatise on horticulture published in England",<ref>{{cite book|last=Henrey|first=Blanche|title=British Botanical and Horticultural Literature before 1800 : Comprising a History and Bibliography of Botanical and Horticultural Books Printed in England, Scotland, and Ireland from the Earliest Times until 1800|location=London|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1975|isbn=0192115480}}</ref> while the Hunt catalogue described it as "a very complete picture of the English garden at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and in such delightful, homely, literary style that gardeners cherish it even to the present day."<ref>{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Rachel McMasters Miller|title=Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=Maurizio Martino|year=[1991]}}</ref> 

The work, which describes the proper cultivation of plants in general, was in three sections: the flower garden, the kitchen garden, and the orchard garden. It did not include specific growing instructions for each type of plant, but at the start of each main section Parkinson provided instructions on "ordering" each type of garden, advising on situating and laying out a garden, tools, soil improvement, grafting, planting and sowing and the types of plants that should be included in each type of garden. It contained illustrations of almost 800 plants in 108 full-page plates. Most of these were original [[woodcut]]s made by the German artist Christopher Switzer, but others appear to have been copied from the works of [[Matthias de Lobel]], [[Charles de l'Écluse]] and the ''Hortus Floridus''<ref>{{cite book|last=van de Passe|first=Crispijn [the Elder]|title=Hortus floridus in quo rariorum & minus vulgarium florum icones ad vivam varamq[ue] formam accuratissime delineatae et secundum quatuor anni tempora divisae exhibentur incredibili labore ac diligentia Crisp.

[[Image:John-Parkinson-002-1640.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustrations of parts of an [[oak]] tree from page 1386 of ''Theatrum Botanicum'' (1640).]]

In ''Paradisi in Sole'' Parkinson hinted that he hoped to add a fourth section, a garden of simples (medicinal herbs).<ref name="KCL"/> He delivered the promise in his other great book, the monumental ''Theatrum Botanicum'' (''The Botanical Theatre'' or ''Theatre of Plants'') which he published in 1640 at the age of 73 years. The release of this work was delayed due to the popularity of Thomas Johnson's edition of [[John Gerard]]'s book ''The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes'' (1597).<ref>{{cite book|last=Gerard|first=John|authorlink=John Gerard|coauthors=Thomas Johnson (ed.)|title=The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes...

Bollifant for Bonham Norton and Iohn Norton|year=1597}} Later editions were published in 1630 (publisher and place of publication unknown), and 1633 and 1636 (London : Adam Islip, Ioice Norton and Richard Whitakers). The book has been republished in the following versions:<p>

It was the first work to describe 33 native plants, 13 of which grew near Parkinson's [[Middlesex]] home. Some of these plants, such as the [[Welsh poppy]], the [[Strawberry Tree]] and the [[Lady's Slipper]], were very common but had gone unnoticed or at least unrecorded.<ref name="KCL"/> He intended the book to be a reliable guide for apothecaries, and it remained so for more than a hundred years after his death.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

Parkinson actively sought new varieties of plants through his contacts abroad and by financing William Boel's plant-hunting expedition to [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and [[North Africa]] in 1607&ndash;1608. He introduced seven new plants into England and was the first gardener in England to grow the great double yellow Spanish [[Narcissus (flower)|daffodil]].<ref name="KCL"/>

His piety as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] is evident from ''Paradisi in Sole''. In his introduction, Parkinson saw the botanical world as an expression of divine creation, and believed that through gardens man could recapture something of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]. Nonetheless, a short French poem<ref>The poem reads:{{quote|''Qui vent parangonner l'artifice a Nature<br>Et nos pares a l'Eden indiscret il mesure.<br>Le pas de l'Elephant par le pas du ciron,<br>Et de l'Aiglele vol parcil du mouscheron.''}}</ref> at the foot of the title page warned the gardener against [[hubris]] and in having excessive regard for his efforts, for whoever tries to compare Art with Nature and gardens with Eden "measures the stride of the elephant by the stride of the mite and the flight of the eagle by that of the gnat".<ref name="KCL"/> However, struggles between [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Catholics compelled Parkinson to keep a low profile. At the height of his success, the [[English Civil War]] (1642&ndash;1651) tore his family apart.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

Parkinson's London house was in [[Ludgate Hill]], but his botanical garden was in suburban [[Long Acre]] in [[Covent Garden]],<ref name="Telegraph"/> a district of [[Market gardening|market-gardens]], today close to [[Trafalgar Square]]. Not much is known about the garden, but based on a study of the writings of Parkinson and others, John Riddell has suggested<ref>{{citation|last=Riddell|first=John|title=John Parkinson's Long Acre Garden 1600&ndash;1650|journal=Journal of Garden History|volume=6|issue=2|year=1986|pages=112&ndash;124}}.</ref> that it was at least two [[acre]]s in size and probably surrounded by a wall. Four hundred and eighty-four types of plant are recorded as having been grown in the garden.<ref name="KCL"/> Thomas Johnson and the [[Hampshire]] botanist, [[John Goodyer]], both gathered seeds there.<ref name="TAMU"/>

Parkinson has been called one of the most eminent gardeners of his day. He maintained close relations with other important English and [[Mainland Europe|Continental]] botanists, herbalists and [[Plantsman|plantsmen]] such as William Coys, [[John Gerard]], [[John Tradescant the elder]] (who was a close friend), Vespasian Robin, and the [[France|Frenchman]] [[Matthias de Lobel]] (also known as Matthias de L'Obel or Matthaeus Lobelius). Together, they belonged to the generation that began to see extraordinary new plants coming from the [[Levant]] and from [[Virginia]], broadly speaking. In his writings, de Lobel frequently mentioned the Long Acre garden and praised Parkinson's abilities. Parkinson, on his part, edited and presented in ''Theatrum Botanicum'' the papers of de Lobel, who had spent the final years of his life in [[Highgate]] supervising the gardens of [[Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche|Edward la Zouche, the 11th Baron Zouche]].<ref name="KCL"/>

Parkinson died in the summer of 1650, and was buried at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], London, on [[6 August]].<ref>There is no extant memorial to Parkinson at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. The present church was completed in 1726 and in the process records of the locations of all original burials were lost. Ledger slabs from earlier memorials exist, but [[James Gibbs]], the architect of the new church building, used them as paving stones and there is no clear record of which slab is where: personal e-mail communication between [[User:Jacklee|Jacklee]] and Mr. Chris Brooker, Parish Clerk of St Martin-in-the-Fields, on [[3 December]] [[2007]].</ref> He is commemorated in the [[Central America]]n [[genus]] of [[Legume|leguminous]] trees ''[[Parkinsonia]]''. ''Paradisi in Sole'' also inspired the children's writer [[Juliana Horatia Ewing]] (1841&ndash;1885) to write the story ''Mary's Meadow'',<ref>Later republished in book form as {{cite book|last=Ewing|first=Juliana Horatia Gatty|authorlink=Juliana Horatia Ewing|title=Mary's Meadow, and Letters from a Little Garden|location=London|publisher=Christian Knowledge Society|year=[1886]}} See {{cite web|last=Ewing|first=Juliana Horatia Gatty|authorlink=Juliana Horatia Ewing|title=Mary's Meadow and Letters from a Little Garden|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/ewing/meadow/meadow.html|publisher=A Celebration of Women Writers, Digital Library Projects, [[University of Pennsylvania]] Libraries|accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref> which was first published from November 1883 to March 1884 in ''Aunt Judy's Magazine'' (1866&ndash;1885), produced by her mother [[Margaret Gatty]]. In the story, some children read ''Paradisi in Sole'' and are inspired to create their own garden. The magazine received much favourable correspondence about the story, and in July 1884 it was suggested that a Parkinson Society should be formed. The objects of the society were to "search out and cultivate old garden flowers which have become scarce; to exchange seeds and plants; to plant waste places with hardy flowers; to circulate books on gardening amongst the Members... [and] to try to prevent the extermination of rare wild flowers, as well as of garden treasures."<ref name="KCL"/>
