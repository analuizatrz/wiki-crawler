'''Pamela Susan Courson''' ([[December 22]] [[1946]] - [[April 25]] [[1974]]) was best known as the long-term companion of late [[The Doors|Doors]]' vocalist [[Jim Morrison]]. After the deaths of Morrison and Courson, her parents petitioned an out-of-state court to declare that the couple had a [[Common-law marriage|common law marriage]], despite the fact that theirs was an open relationship, and that Morrison's will described him as "an unmarried person."

==Biography==
===Early life and involvement with Morrison===
Courson was born in [[Weed, California]]. One biography states that she and Morrison met at a nightclub on the [[Sunset Strip]] in [[1965]], while Courson was an art student at [[Los Angeles City College]]. In his 1998 [[memoir]], ''Light My Fire: My Life with the Doors'', former keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] stated that Courson and a friend saw the band during their stint at the London Fog, a lesser-known nightclub, and that she was initially courted by Arthur Lee of the Californian band "Love", who brought "The Doors" to the attention of Elektra boss Jack Holzman.

In any event, Morrison called Courson his "cosmic mate" and dedicated his self-published books of poetry to her, as well as songs such as "Love Street".[http://www.swinginchicks.com/pamela_morrison.htm] Their relationship was tumultuous, with repeated infidelity by both partners. Morrison even married another girlfriend, [[Patricia Kennealy]], at an unofficial Wiccan wedding in 1970. In an interview for the book ''Rock Wives'', Kennealy said of Courson: "I really did like her. She was nice. She wasn't an incredibly towering intellect, but she seemed very sweet and very pretty, very California". [http://www.swinginchicks.com/pamela_morrison.htm]

Courson had no job or career of her own while she was with Morrison, other than a brief attempt at running Themis, a fashion boutique that Morrison bought for her.  Her death certificate lists her occupation as “women’s apparel.”

===Deaths of Morrison and Courson===
On [[July 3]] [[1971]] Morrison was found dead by Courson in the bathtub of an apartment they were sharing in Paris. He was 27 years old. The official coroner's report listed his cause of death as heart failure. However, despite Morrison's age and apparent good health, and the presence of blood in the water, no autopsy was performed. Questions persist over the actual cause of death. As per the stipulation in his will, which stated that he was "an unmarried person", Courson inherited his entire fortune, yet lawsuits against the estate would tie up her quest for inheritance for the next two years. After Pamela Courson received her share of Morrison's royalties, she never renewed contact with the remaining Doors members. 

After Morrison's death, Courson became a recluse, using heroin and showing signs of mental instability. On [[April 25]] [[1974]], Courson died of a [[heroin]] [[overdose]] at the Los Angeles apartment she shared with two male friends. Like Morrison, she was 27 at the time of her death. Her parents intended that she be buried next to Morrison at Pere-Lachaise cemetery in Paris, and listed this location as the place of burial on her death certificate, but due to legal complications with transporting the body to France, her parents had her [[remains]] buried at Fairhaven Memorial Park in [[Santa Ana, California]], under the name "Pamela Susan Morrison". After her death, her parents Columbus and Penny inherited Morrison's entire fortune, but their executorship of the estate was later contested by Morrison's parents, George and Clara Morrison.

===Estate controversy===
In his will, made in Los Angeles County on [[February 12]] [[1969]], Morrison (who describes himself as "an unmarried person") left his entire estate to Pamela Courson, also naming her co-executor with his attorney, Max Fink. She thus inherited everything upon Morrison’s death in [[1971]].

When Courson died, a battle ensued between Morrison’s parents and Courson’s parents, Columbus and Penny Courson, over who had legal claim to what had been Morrison’s estate. Since Morrison left a will, the question was effectively moot. On his death, his property became Courson’s property; and on her death, her property passed to her next heirs at law, who were her parents. Morrison's parents did not accept this and contested the will under which Courson and now her parents had inherited their son’s property.

To bolster their positions, Courson’s parents presented a document they claimed she had acquired in [[Colorado]], apparently an application for a declaration that she and Morrison had contracted a common law marriage under the laws of that state. The ability to contract a common-law marriage was abolished in California in [[1896]], but the state's conflict of laws rules provided for recognition of common-law marriages lawfully contracted in foreign jurisdictions - and Colorado was one of the eleven U.S. jurisdictions that still recognized common-law marriage. So, as long as a common-law marriage was lawfully contracted under Colorado law, it was recognised as a marriage under California law.

It is not known whether Courson acquired the application before or after Morrison’s death, or indeed whether it was she or her parents who acquired it. In either case, Morrison, who did not fill it out or sign it, may have never known about the document, and neither Morrison nor Courson appear to have ever been residents of Colorado. But those facts would not necessarily be relevant to the court’s deliberation on the validity of a common-law marriage, since the determination would be made according to Colorado law. Many of the jurisdictions which still permitted the common law contract of a marriage provide that either party may demand a declaration that a common law marriage was contracted between them, whether the other party (if living) agrees or not. The burden of proof is on the applicant, in any case, to prove that a marriage existed. What is ironic in this case is that both of the alleged applicants were dead, and it was their parents who were trying to prove or disprove that there had been a common-law marriage.

Whatever the circumstances of the unsigned document and the court case, and the controversy surrounding it, the California probate court decided that Courson and Morrison had a common-law marriage under the laws of Colorado. The effect of the court's ruling was to close probate of Morrison's and Courson's estates, and reinforce the Courson family's hold on the inheritance.

Courson was portrayed by [[Meg Ryan]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film, ''The Doors''.
