'''Karnātakā''' {{audio|Karnataka.ogg|pronunciation}} ([[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ಕನಾ೯ಟಕ) ({{IPA2|kəɹnɑːʈəkɑː}}) is one of the four [[South India|southern]] [[States and territories of India|state]]s of [[India]]. Previously known as the state of ''[[Mysore state|Mysore]]'', Karnataka got its present name in 1973. The present boundaries of the Karnataka state were decided in 1956 by the [[States Reorganisation Act]]. [[Kannada]] is the official language of the state. Karnataka is sub-divided into 27 districts and it is the [[List of states of India by area|8th largest Indian state by area]] and [[List of states of India by population|9th largest by population]]. The city of [[Bengaluru]]/[[Bangalore]]; also known as the ''Silicon Valley'' of India, is the capital of Karnataka. Karnataka can be broadly divided into three geographical regions, viz. [[Karavali]], [[Malnad]] and [[Bayaluseemae]]. Karnataka is a tourist's paradise having waterfalls like [[Jog Falls|Jog]], hill-stations like [[Madikeri]], national parks like [[Nagarhole National Park|Nagarhole]] and historical places like [[Hampi]]. It is also rich in culture as can be seen in dances like [[Yakshagana]] and the festivities held in [[Mysore]] during the time of [[Mysore Dasara|Dasara]]. Among all the states of [[India]], Karnataka has the maximum number of [[Jnanpith]] awardees.

==Origin of name==
{{main|Origin of Karnataka's name}}
Karnataka got its name in 1973 when the existing [[Mysore state]] was renamed as ''Karnataka''.

Several [[etymology|etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka. One accepted derivative comes from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''nādu'' meaning ''elevated land''. <ref name="kstdc"> Karnataka being knows as ''Karu nadu'' in ancient times is mentioned by {{cite web|url=http://kstdc.nic.in/history.htm|title=History of Karnataka|work=Online Webpage of the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation|publisher=(KSTDC)|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> ''Karu nadu'' may also be read as ''Karu''(black) and ''nadu''(region); as a reference to the [[black soil|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayaluseemae]] region of Karnataka.<ref>http://19.1911encyclopedia.org/C/CA/CARNATIC.htm</ref> 

During the [[British Raj]], the words ''Carnatic'' or ''Karnatak'' were used to describe this part of the region in general. Historically, the name ''[[Carnatic region]]'' applied to the regions below the [[Western Ghats]] ([[Coorg]] and [[Kerala]]) as well as regions in present day [[Andhra Pradesh]] ([[Telingana]]).<ref>http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V09_308.gif</ref>

{{main|History of Karnataka|The great Karnataka Expansion}}

Evidence of [[Neolithic]] habitation of areas in modern Karnataka and [[celt (tool)|celt]]s dating back to the 2nd century [[Before Common Era|BCE]] were first discovered in 1872. There are reports that a polished [[stone axe]] was discovered at Lingsugur in the [[Raichur district]]; however the authenticity of these reports remains unverifiable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/10/stories/2005011001090500.htm |title= `First-ever celt was found near Madikeri' |accessdate=2007-05-06 |publisher=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref> [[Megalithic]] structures one of them of [[Gomateshwara]] is considered to be the monument of Ganga period and burial grounds were discovered in 1862 in the regions of [[Kodagu]] and [[Moorey Betta]] hills, while [[Neolithic]] sites were discovered in north Karnataka. 

Scholarly hypothesis postulates of contacts between the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] city of [[Harappa]] in 3000 BCE, citing the discovery of gold found in the Harappan sites that was imported from mines in Karnataka.<ref>http://metalrg.iisc.ernet.in/~wootz/heritage/K-hertage.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka7.htm |title=Prehistoric culture of Karnataka

Rock [[edict]]s of Ashoka, written in [[Prakrit]], were discovered in [[Chitradurga]] and Raichur. In the [[4th century BCE]], the [[Satavahana]] dynasty came to power and its rule lasted nearly 3 centuries.

[[Image:Mysorepalace.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Mysore Palace]]

The disintegration of the Satavahana dynasty led to the ascent of the first native kingdoms, the [[Banavasi]] [[Kadambas]](325-540 CE) from [[Uttara Kannada]] region, and the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] (325-550 CE) in southern Karnataka. These were the first kingdoms to give administrative status to Kannada language as evidenced by the [[Halmidi inscription]] of 450, attributed to King [[Kakusthavarma]] of the [[Kadamba Dynasty]]. Also, recent discovery of a 5th century copper coin in [[Banavasi]], ancient capital of the [[Kadambas]], with [[Kannada script]] inscription on it, further proves the usage of Kannada at an official level.<ref>{{cite web

Nripa Kama established the [[Hoysala Empire]] at the turn of the first millennium. Art and architecture flourished in the region during the time that resulted in the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the ''Vesara'' style of architecture.  The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought large parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under their rule.<ref name="arbiters">The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] city of Kannanur Kuppam near [[Srirangam]] became the second capital of the Hoysalas during the rule of [[Vira Narasimha II]]. During the time of [[Veera Ballala III]], Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu had been made an alternate capital, from where the Hoysala fought the Sultan of Madurai. The Hoysalas were regarded as practically the arbiters of [[South Indian]] politics. With the waning of Chola and Pandya power, the Hoysalas took up the leadership role in the South India, according to Prof. B.S.K. Iyengar, ''A Concise History of Karnataka'', Dr. S.U. Kamath. The Hoysala rule saw the consolidation and domination of Southern [[Deccan]] as a single empire, Dr. Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India''</ref>

In the early 14th century, the Vijayanagara empire with its capital at Hosapattana (later to be called [[Vijayanagara]]) rose to successfully challenge the Muslim invasions into the South.  This empire was established by Harihara and Bukka Raya, commanders of the last Hoysala King [[Veera Ballala|Veera Ballala III]].
The [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani sultans]] of [[Gulbarga]] and the [[Adil Shahi]] sultans of [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] ruled over the region after the defeat and disintegration of the Vijayanagara Empire in battle at Talikota. The Bahamani rulers encouraged [[Urdu]] and Persian literature and [[Islamic architecture]]. The [[Gol Gumbaz]] was constructed during this time. With the defeat of the Bahmani sultans, the entire region came into the dominion of the [[Mughal Empire]].

The [[Wodeyar]]s of Mysore, former vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire, leased the state from the Mughal king [[Aurangzeb]] in the 15th century. With the death of [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar II]], [[Haidar Ali]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Mysore Army, assumed control over the region, until the rule of the kingdom was passed to [[Tippu Sultan]], after Haidar Ali's death. 

In attempting to contain [[Europe]] an expansion in South India, Tippu Sultan, known as the Tiger of Mysore fought four significant [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]], the last of which resulted in his death and the incorporation of Mysore into the [[British Raj]] in 1799.  

After Indian independence, the [[Wodeyar]] Maharaja acceded to India. In 1950, [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] became an Indian [[Mysore State|state of the same name]], and the former Maharaja became its [[Rajpramukh]], head of state, until 1975. 

The [[Unification of Karnataka|Ekikarana movement]] started in the late 19th century and culminated in the formation of Karnataka state in 1956, nine years after [[Indian independence|independence]].  The [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956 provided for parts of [[Coorg]], [[Madras State|Madras]], [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], and [[Bombay state]]s to be incorporated into the [[Mysore State|state of Mysore]]. Mysore state was renamed Karnataka in 1973.  The state of Mysore was formed on [[November 1]] [[1956]] and since then [[November 1]] of every year is celebrated as [[Kannada Rajyotsava]] / [[Karnataka Rajyotsava]].

Administratively, Karnataka has been divided into four division - the Gulbarga , Bengaluru, Mysore, Belgaum.  These division comprise a total of 27 districts  which in turn has been split into 176 [[Taluks of Karnataka |taluks]].  Until 1989, there were only 19 districts, when Bangalore rural was carved out of the the then existing Bangalore district.  In 1997, seven more districts - [[Bagalkot]], [[Chamarajanagar]], [[Davanagere]], [[Gadag]], [[Koppal]], [[Haveri]] and [[Udupi]] were carved out their neighbouring districts to take the count to 27.

<!--Karnataka was earlier known as the [[Mysore state|state of Mysore]]. Prior to 1953, the Mysore state contained only 9 districts, ''viz.'' Bangalore, Kolar, Tumkur, Mandya, Mysore, Hassan, Chikmagalur (Kadur), Shimoga and Chitradurga. When the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] was formed in 1953, the district of [[Bellary]] was added to the Mysore state. With the [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956, [[Bidar]], [[Gulbarga]] and [[Raichur]] districts from the [[Hyderabad state]], [[Belgaum]], [[Bijapur]], [[Dharwad]] and [[Uttara Kannada]] from the [[Bombay state]], the state of [[Kodagu]], the district of [[Dakshina Kannada]] and the taluk of [[Kollegal]] from the [[Madras state]] were added to [[Mysore state]]. Mysore state was renamed as Karnataka in the year 1973.

745 hoblies/Revenue Circles for administrative purposes. The State has 27,028 inhabited and 2,362 uninhabited villages, 281 towns and urban agglomerations. -->

===Administration===
Government administration under the Indian constitution is divided into three main arms
;Legislature
The Karnataka legislature has two houses: 
* Legislative Assembly (Vidhana Sabha): This is the lower house. Legislative Assembly members are elected directly by the people of Karnataka. The Government is formed by the elected members of the assembly. The election to the Legislative Assmebly is held once in five years which is also the tenure of an elected Government. But in case the Government loses the confidence of the Assembly, a mid-term election may become necessary. The first sitting of the Legislative Assembly was held on 19th December 1956 in the newly constructed [[Vidhana Soudha]]. The total seats in the assembly is 224.<ref name="legi"> A description of the Karnataka legislature is provided by {{cite web|url=http://www.kar.nic.in/kla/legislature.htm|title=Origin and Growth of Karnataka Legislature|work=Online Webpage of the Government of Karnataka|publisher=Government of Karnataka|accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>
* Legislative Council (Vidhana Parishat): This is the upper house. The Legislative Council is is composed of 75 members, out of whom 25 are elected by Legislative Assembly members, 25 are elected by Local Authorities, 7 are elected by the Graduates, 7 are eleceted by Teachers and 11 members are nominated by the Governor of Karnataka.<ref name="legi"> </ref>

;Executive
This arm of the Government is headed by [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy commissioners]] or District magistrates in each of the 27 districts.  These officers belong to the [[Indian Administrative Service]].

{{seealso|Kannada literature}}

Kannada, which is the native tongue of roughly 65% of the Karnataka's population is the official language of the state and was also the basis for the creation of Karnataka when states across India were reorganised in 1956 based on linguistic demographics.  Apart from Kannada, [[Tulu]], [[Kodava Takk]] and [[Konkani]] are the major languages that are native to the state and share a long history with the state.  [[Urdu]] is also spoken widely by the [[Muslim]] population in the state.  Other languages include the [[Beary]] and certain other dialects like [[Sanketi]].    

In the field of literature, Kannada has been the most decorated among all contemporary Indian literatures with seven [[Jnanpith|Jnanapitha]] awards.  It also boasts of a rich and ancient body of literature that dates back to the first millenium.  The earliest attested inscription in Kannada dates to 450 AD and the earliest extant literary work has been dated to 850 AD.  Tulu is spoken in the coastal areas of Karnataka mainly in the districts of [[Udupi]] and [[Dakshina Kannada]].  ''Tulu Mahabharato'', which was written by Arunabja, a poet from Kodavur, [[Malpe]] in Tulu script is the oldest written Tulu document available.<ref name="tuluold"> The history of Tulu is described by {{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/11/13/stories/2004111302140500.htm|author=Raviprasad Kamila|title=Tulu Academy yet to realise its goal|work=Online webpage of The Hindu, dated 2004-011-13|accessdate=2007-05-05|publisher=2004, The Hindu}}</ref>  

The [[Tulu script]] which was in use until a few centuries ago gradually fell into disuse and the language now uses the Kannada script.  Kodava Takk is spoken by the [[Kodava]] people of [[Kodagu]] district where two major variations of the language, the northern ''Mendale Takka'' and the southern ''Kiggaati takka'' exist.  [[Konkani]] is mostly spoken in the north coastal districts of Karnataka and some parts of the south coastal districts of [[Udupi]] and [[Dakshina Kannada]].  Literature in Kodava Takk and Konkani has been on a limited scale and like Tulu, they too use the Kannada script.  Two regional variations of this language exists, Mendale takka (North Coorg Variety), and Kiggaati takka (south Coorg variety). <ref name="takk"> History of Kodava Takk is provided by {{cite web|url=http://www.languageinindia.com/oct2001/kodavarajyashree.html|author=K.S.

All languages in the state are patronised and promoted by governmental and quasi-governmental bodies.  The [[Kannada Sahitya Parishat]] and the Kannada Sahitya Akademi are responsible for the promotion of Kannada while the Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Akademi,<ref name="konkani"> Usage of Kannada script for Konkani language is mentioned by {{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/sep162005/district1814202005915.asp|title=Konkan Prabha released|work=Online webpage of The Deccan Herald, dated 2005-09-16|publisher=2005, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.|accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref>  Tulu Sahitya Akademi and Kodava Sahitya Akademi look into the affairs of the respective languages.

English is the medium of education in many schools in the state of Karnataka and is the widely used in the college curriculum especially in courses related to science, engineering and medicine. English is also widely used for business communication in technology-related companies and call centres. Popular English language writers like [[R. K. Narayan]] and [[Raja Rao]] hail from the state.

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Karnataka}}
Buses, cars and trains are the means of transport for moving across distant places in Karnataka. For transportation within the city or town limits; motorbikes, cars, [[autorickshaw]]s and buses are used. With the advent of low-cost airlines, many people are choosing to travel via air as well.

===Air transport===
[[Image:flykingfisher.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A Toyota F1 car sponsored by [[Kingfisher Airlines]], which is based in Bangalore, Karnataka]]

''For a list of flights operating out of cities in Karnataka, please see the article: [[List of Destinations to/from all Karnataka Airports|Destinations to/from all Karnataka airports]]''

Air transport in Karnataka, much like the rest of the country is still a fledling but fast expanding sector.  Karnataka has airports at Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Hubballi, Belagavi, Hampi and Mysore.  Of these, international flights operate from [[Mangalore]] and [[Bangalore]] airports alone.  While the international flights from [[Mangalore]] are limited to countries located in the [[Middle East]], [[Bangalore]] has good international connectivity to and from several international hubs.  Airlines like the [[Lufthansa]], [[British Airways]], [[Singapore Airlines]] and [[Malaysian Airlines]] are some of the important airlines that operate out of the [[HAL airport]] in the city.  The burgeoning population, the rapid strides made by the IT sector and the general business climate in the country as a whole has led to a manifold increase in air traffic and hence a [[Bangalore International Airport Limited |new airport]] has been envisaged at [[Devanahalli]] on the outskirts of Bengaluru.  With Bangalore being the 'IT capital' of India, the air traffic to this city has increased manifold. The existing HAL airport does not have sufficient infrastructure to handle this increase in air traffic, and hence a new airport (currently called as [[Bangalore International Airport Limited|Bangalore International Airport]]) is being constructed at [[Devanahalli]] in the outskirts of [[Bangalore]]. This airport is expected to be operational by April 2008.

Bangalore is also the headquarters of the low-cost airline [[Air Deccan]] which has been instrumental in opening up the previously unused airports of [[Hampi]], [[Bellary]], [[Hubli]] and [[Belgaum]] to passenger air traffic. It is also the headquarters of [[Kingfisher Airlines]]. A new airport has also been planned at [[Mysore]], one of the major cities of the state.

===Rail transport===

Only [[Bangalore]] is connected well by trains to other cities in [[India]]. The following reasons indicate the poor rail network in the state:
* [[Mangalore]], one of the major towns in Karnataka has no trains to other major cities like [[Bangalore]], [[Mysore]] and [[Hubli]]. 
* [[Metre gauge]] tracks from [[Shimoga]] to Talguppa and [[Mysore]] to [[Chamarajanagar]] have no or very few trains running on them.
* District capitals like [[Chikkamagaluru]] and [[Madikeri]] are not connected by a rail network
* The district of [[Kodagu]] has no railway track within it. 
* Doubling of the track between [[Bangalore]] and [[Mysore]] (a line that receives very good patronage) is yet to be completed. 
* Though the state has [[Konkan Railway]] within it; it has remained isolated with no trains running from other parts of the state to places that exist on the [[Konkan Railway]]. 

The superpast [[Shatabdi Express]] trains run from [[Bangalore]] to [[Chennai]] and [[Mysore]]. A ''Jan Shatabdi'' express runs from [[Bangalore]] to [[Hubli]] and this is the first train in India that has been fitted with a GPS (Global Position System) based Location Announcement System.

The road from [[Bangalore]] to [[Mysore]] (State Highway 17) is also well maintained and equal to the standard of a National Highway.

The public bus transport in Karnataka is managed by the [[Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation]] (KSRTC). It was set up in the year 1961 with the objective of providing adequate, efficient, economic and properly coordinated road transport services.<ref name="ksrtc"> A brief disussion on KSRTC is provided by {{cite web|url=http://ksrtc.in/about_ksrtc.htm|title=About KSRTC|work=Online webpage of KSRTC|publisher=KSRTC|accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> It operates 5100 schedules using 5400 vehicles covering 1.95 million kilometres and an average of 2.2 million passengers daily.

The reserrvation system is networked and computerised and tickets can be availed at designated kiosks in towns and cities. An online reservation system called ''AWATAR'' has also been devised by KSRTC using which travellers can reserve tickets online. KSRTC plies various categories of buses viz. Airavata (high-end luxury Volvo AC buses), Mayura (luxury AC buses), Rajahamsa (deluxe buses), Semi-deluxe and normal buses. ''Grameena Sarige'' is another initiative by KSRTC to provide bus service to the rural populace of the state.

[[Image:FullPagadeYakshagana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Yakshagana]] artist]]
===Music===
'''Carnatic''' 
:''Main article'' [[Carnatic Music]]
The Kannada haridasa movement sowed the seeds of this art in the 13th-15th century AD. With the rise of [[Vaishnavism]] and the [[Haridasa]] movement came Karnataka composers like [[Purandaradasa]], whose Kannada language works were complex, devotional and philosophical. Other haridasas of medeval times were [[Kanakadasa]], [[Vyasatirtha]], [[Jayatirtha]], [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vadirajatirtha]] and others who composed several ''devara nama''. One of the earliest and prominent composers in South India was the saint, and wandering divine singer of yore [[Purandara Dasa]] (1480-1564 AD). Purandara Dasa is believed to have composed 475,000 songs in [[Kannada]] and was a source of inspiration to the later composers like [[Tyagaraja]]. He also invented the tala system of [[Carnatic]] music. Owing to his contribution to the Carnatic Music he is referred to as the ''Father of Carnatic Music'' or ''Karnataka Sangeeta Pitaamaha''. 
Later in the 17th and 18th centuries, the haridasa movement would once again contribute to music in Karnataka the form of haridasas like Vijayadasa, Gopaladasa, Jagannathadasa and others.

{{main|Religion in Karnataka}}
{{See also|Haridasa|Virashaiva}}

Karnataka has played a very important role in shaping present day Indian religion and philosophy.  The three most important schools of Hindu philosophy, ''[[Advaita]]'', ''[[Dvaita]]'' and ''[[Vishistadvaita]]'' blossomed in Karnataka.  While [[Madhvacharya]] (1238-1317) was born and belonged to Karnataka, [[Adi Shankaracharya]] chose [[Sringeri]] in Karnataka to set up the first of his four ''mathas''.  [[Ramanujacharya]] who fled persecution at the hands of a Shaivaite Chola king also settled down in [[Melkote]] in Karnataka,<ref name="persecution">Fearing persecution by the Cholas who were staunch [[Shaiva]], Ramanujacharya came to Karnataka in 1098 and lived there until 1122 He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana temple and a well organised [[Matha]] were built. Hoysala Vishnuvardhana became his devotee and converted from Jainism to Hinduism. This helped popularise his Vishva adviata philosophy in the region, ''A Concise History of Karnataka'', Dr. S.U. Kamath, ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', by Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri</ref> which is today a fountainhead of the Vishishtadvaita faith.  

In the 12th century, [[Veerashaivism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste systems.  Leading figures of the movement such as [[Basavanna|Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]] established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] where the philosophy of ''[[Veerashaivism|Shakti Vishishtadvaita]]'' was expounded.  This was to form the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith and today counts millions among its followers.   

The [[Jainism|Jaina]] faith also has its fountainhead in Karnataka.  [[Rishabhadeva]] is said to have spent his final days in Karnataka.  Both Jain philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka.  The Jain influence on literature and philosophy is particularly evident in the literatures of Kannada and Tamil.

Islam gained a foothold in Karnataka with the arrival of the Bahamani sultans who ruled Karnataka and many other parts of southern India following the fall of the [[Vijayanagar]] empire.  Christianity reached Karnataka in the 16th century with the arrival of the Portuguese.  Today, both Islam and Christianity have a sizeable following in Karnataka and have contributed richly to the cultural cosmopolitanism of the state.  Buddhism also thrives in Karnataka.  Karnataka is home to the Dzogchen monastery and the Dhondeling Tibetan refugee camps.

[[Udupi]], [[Sringeri]], [[Gokarna]] and [[Melkote]] are well known places of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] learning. [[Shravanabelagola]], [[Mudabidri]], [[Karkala]] are famous for Jain history and monuments.
