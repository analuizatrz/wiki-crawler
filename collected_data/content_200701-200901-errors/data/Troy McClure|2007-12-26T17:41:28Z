'''Troy McClure''' is a recurring [[fictional character]] in the [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'', who was [[voice acting|voiced]] by [[Phil Hartman]], and first appeared in the episode "[[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]]."<ref name=first>{{cite video | people=Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike|year=2002|title=The Simpsons The Complete Second Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> McClure was based on [[B-movie]] actors [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Doug McClure]], as well as Hartman himself. After Phil Hartman's murder in 1998, the character was retired, and last appeared in the season ten episode "[[Bart the Mother]]." He is one of the show's most popular recurring characters and, had Hartman not died, could have been the subject of a [[live-action]] film. 

McClure is a washed-up actor, frequently shown presenting infomercials and educational videos. He is vain, and cares principally for himself, marrying [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Selma Bouvier]] to aid his failing career and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure appears as the central character only in the episode "[[A Fish Called Selma]]", but presents the episodes "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]" and "[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]."

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
McClure is a stereotypical [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] has-been, reduced to appearing in low quality films and television presenting jobs. During the early seventies he had a highly successful acting career, but it has since become worse.<ref name=fcs/> Throughout his appearances on the show McClure is primarily shown presenting short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often is shown presenting educational videos<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Vegetarian|episodelink=Lisa the Vegetarian |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David; Kirkland, Mark; Mirkin, David|network=Fox |airdate=1995-10-15 |season=7 |number=133}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Simpson|episodelink=Lisa the Simpson |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Goldreyer, Ned; Dietter, Susie; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Reardon, Jim; Reiss, Mike; Jean, Al|network=Fox |airdate=1998-03-08 |season=9 |number=195}}</ref> and [[infomercial]]s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Marge in Chains|episodelink=Marge in Chains |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1993-05-06 |season=4 |number=80}}</ref> When introducing anything that he does, McClure lists projects that he has previously done with the phrase "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [films, educational videos, voiceovers, etc.] as..." and will mention two titles of a similar subject to that of the current performance he is giving.

McClure's career went downhill due to his reported unusual [[paraphilia]], which apparently involved [[fish]], to the point where he had not worked in twelve years. To cover this up, he began a relationship with [[Selma Bouvier]], whom he had met when she gave him an eye test at the Department of Motor Vehicles. This revived his career, leading him to star in ''Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!'', a musical version of the film ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''. To further revive his career, McClure's agent suggests that he marry Selma, a proposal which she accepts. At his bachelor party, a drunken McClure tells [[Homer Simpson]] that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. At the wedding, an unknowing Selma marries Troy. Selma discovers that their marriage was a sham and although she accepted it, she drew the line when McClure's agent suggested that the pair have a child. As "all the big parts these days are going to family men" having a child would have secured McClure's casting as [[Rainier Wolfcastle|McBain's]] sidekick in ''McBain IV: Fatal Discharge''. Having rejected his offer, Selma leaves McClure. As a result McClure stars in his own independent film ''The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Fish Called Selma |episodelink=A Fish Called Selma |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Barth, Jack; Kirkland, Mark; Weinstein, Josh; Oakley, Bill|network=Fox |airdate=1996-03-24 |season=7 |number=147}}</ref>

In addition to his appearances within episodes, McClure presented the episodes "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]" and "[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]". The first is a behind the scenes look at ''The Simpsons'', answering questions and featuring extra "never before seen" material.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular|episodelink=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, John; Silverman, David; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1995-12-03 |season=7 |number=138}}</ref> The second is an episode presenting three possible spin-offs from ''The Simpsons''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase|episodelink=The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David; Greaney, Dan; Tompkins, Steve; Affleck, Neil; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1995-12-03 |season=7 |number=138}}</ref>

==Character==
===Creation===
[[Image:Troyconcept.png|thumb|right|200px|A concept drawing of McClure by [[Mark Kirkland]], for the episode "[[A Fish Called Selma]]."]]
McClure was based on the typical "washed up" Hollywood actor, with inspiration for his character and name being drawn from [[B-movie]] actors [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Doug McClure]].<ref name=first/><ref name=inter>{{cite interview|last=Groening|first=Matt|subjectlink = Matt Groening| interviewer = [[Terry Gross]]| title = Fresh Air| program = [[National Public Radio]]| callsign = [[WHYY]]| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4249835| city = Philadelphia| date = 2004-12-29| accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref> [[Phil Hartman]] was cast in the role due to his ability to pull "the maximum amount of humor" out of any line he was given,<ref name=inter/> and McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself.<ref>{{cite video|people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]"|medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> McClure's car is a [[De Lorean DMC-12]], and his house was based on the [[Chemosphere]] from the film ''[[Body Double]]''.<ref name=fcs/> Writer [[Mike Reiss]] later met Doug McClure's daughter who revealed that her father had found the homage funny and that his children would call their father Troy McClure when his back was turned.<ref name=first/>

===Development===
McClure's character is developed in "A Fish Called Selma", when a more in-depth look into his private life is shown. The episode is the only one in the entire run of the series that shows true emotion from Troy McClure.<ref name=fcs/> Show runners [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] were big fans of Phil Hartman, and wished to make an episode entirely about McClure in order to give him as much to do as possible. From this came the idea of him marrying [[Selma Bouvier]], as she was "always marrying people."<ref name=fcs/> Having McClure as the star of the episode pleased animator [[Mark Kirkland]], as he found McClure's voice great to animate to, allowing him and other animators to "open him up visually as a character."<ref name=fcs/> It is hinted throughout the course of the episode that he has strange sexual behavior. Throughout the production of the episode, the writers did not know what the "unsavory" sexual preference was. They decided on a fish fetish, an idea [[James L. Brooks]] suggested as it was "so perverted and strange, it was over the top."<ref name=fcs/> McClure's apparent fish fetish was mentioned by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in their article about a Swiss scientist's discovery that sticklebacks ejaculate more sperm after they have seen images of fish flirting.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,,976153,00.html|title=Fish porn|date=[[2003-06-12]]|accessdate=2007-06-08|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Simon Jeffery}}</ref>

===Retirement===
Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife [[Brynn Hartman|Brynn]] on [[May 28]] [[1998]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9805/28/hartman/|title=Phil Hartman, wife die in apparent murder-suicide|accessdate=2007-06-08|date=[[1998-05-28]]|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> Rather than replace Hartman with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure, along with Hartman's other character [[Lionel Hutz]], from the show.<ref name=inter/> He last appeared in the season ten episode "[[Bart the Mother]]." Before his death, Phil Hartman had often expressed an interest in starring in a live action film about McClure, with several of the show's writers wanting to help make it.<ref>{{cite video|people=Oakley, Bill|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homerpalooza]]"|medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Josh Weinstein]] stated that the plot of "A Fish Called Selma" could have worked well as a live action film.<ref name=fcs>{{cite video|people=Weinstein, Josh; Oakley, Bill; Silverman, David; Goldblum, Jeff|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[A Fish Called Selma]]"|medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Matt Groening]] later told ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' that the idea never "got further than enthusiasm" but that "it would have been really fun."<ref name="empire">{{cite news | author = Olly Richards | title = Life In Development Hell | pages = 76 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2007-05-24]] | accessdate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> 
Hartman was cast before his death as [[Zapp Brannigan]] in Matt Groening's ''[[Futurama]]''. [[Billy West]] took over the role, and based his vocal performance on Hartman's characterizations, particularly McClure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/15/billy-west-the-tv-squad-interview/|title=Billy West: The TV Squad Interview|accessdate=2007-06-09|date=[[2006-06-15]]|author=Joel Keller|publisher=TV Squad.com}}</ref>

==Cultural influence and legacy==

In a 2006 article [[IGN.com]] ranked McClure in first position on their list of the "Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters", citing that he is "a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining character that showcases the best of what small roles on ''The Simpsons'' can be."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p5.html|title=Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters|accessdate=2007-06-08|date=[[2006-09-06]]|author=Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, Brian Zoromski|publisher=[[IGN.com]]}}</ref> In his book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', Chris Turner describes McClure in detail citing that he, along with Lionel Hutz, "represent the most significant contribution to the show outside its permanent cast" and that "the show's Golden Age is hard to imagine without them". McClure became the perfect portrayal of a media stereotype and a "gut-achingly funny reinterpretation" of a character type that had been "done to death".<ref name=Turner>{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Chris | title=[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]] |publisher=Random House of Canada |id=ISBN 0-679-31318-4|pages=pg. 405–6}}</ref> Adam Finley named Phil Hartman one of the five best guest stars on ''The Simpsons'', saying that McClure was "responsible for some of the funniest moments in ''Simpsons'' history."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/20/the-five-great-simpsons-guest-stars/|title=The Five: Great Simpsons guest stars|accessdate=2007-06-23|date=[[2006-06-20]]|author=Adam Finley|publisher=TV Squad}}</ref> ''Star News Online'' named Hartman as one of the four hundred reasons why they loved ''The Simpsons'', adding that they missed McClure,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wilmingtonstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070520/NEWS/70518023/0/news36|title=400 reasons we love 'The Simpsons'|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Jeff Hidek|publisher=Star News Online}}</ref> while ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named Hartman as the 87th greatest TV icon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20152957_20152958_20159463_13,00.html|title=Greatest TV Icons: Nos. 100-51|accessdate=2007-11-15|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> ''[[The Observer]]'' listed McClure educational films ''Smoke Yourself Thin''; ''Get Confident, Stupid!''; ''Firecrackers: the Silent Killer'' and ''Fuzzy Bunny's Guide to You-know-what'' as part of their list of the three hundred reasons why they loved the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,939751,00.html|title=300 reasons why we love The Simpsons|accessdate=2007-08-03|date=[[2003-04-20]]|author=Euan Ferguson|publisher[[The Observer]]}}</ref>  

McClure's most prominent episode, "A Fish Called Selma", is often regarded as one of the best episodes in the show's history, and is one of the top five favorites of the staff.<ref name=fcs/> ''Entertainment Weekly'' placed the episode eighth on their top 25 ''The Simpsons'' episode list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_2,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|accessdate=2007-06-09|date=[[2003-01-29]]|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> IGN.com named the episode the best of the seventh season, stating that it seemed the "obvious pick."
