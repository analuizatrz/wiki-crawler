==Early life==
Willis was born in [[Idar-Oberstein]], [[Germany]] to David Willis, an American [[soldier]], and a [[Kassel]]-born German [[mother]], Marlene, who worked in a [[bank]].<ref name="DailyM">{{cite web | title=Daily Mail | work=Die Another Day: Bruce Willis | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/live/live.html?in_article_id=462215&in_page_id=1889 | accessdate=June 20 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Willis was the oldest of four children (his siblings are Florence, David, and Robert). After being [[military discharge|discharged]] from the [[military]] in 1957, Willis's [[father]] took his family back to [[Penns Grove, New Jersey]], where he worked as a [[welder]] and factory worker.<ref name="AskMen">{{cite web | title=AskMen.com | work=Bruce Willis | url=http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment/45c_bruce_willis.html | accessdate=June 21 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> His parents separated in 1971 while Willis was in his early teens.<ref name="DailyM"/> He was always an outgoing youngster, although he grew up with a [[stuttering|stutter]].<ref name="BWillisUncut">{{cite web|title=Reader's Digest|work=Bruce Willis: The Uncut Interview| url=http://www.rd.com/images/content/021102/bruce_willis_interview.pdf| accessdate=June 23|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Finding it easy to express himself on [[stage]] and losing his stutter in the process, Willis began performing on stage and his [[high school]] memberships were marked by such things as the drama club and school council [[president]].<ref name="DigitalH">{{cite web|title=Digital Hit|work=Bruce Willis|url=http://www.digitalhit.com/cr/brucewillis|accessdate=June 20|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Rather than go to [[college]] after [[graduation]], Willis farmed [[sheep]] in a [[mining]] village in [[Alabama]], transporting work crews at the [[DuPont]] Chambers Works factory in [[Deepwater, New Jersey]]. He decided to quit after a colleague was killed on the job, and thereafter became a regular at several bars. Willis also discovered an innate knack for playing [[harmonica]] and joined a [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[band (music)|band]] called Loose Goose.<ref name="DigitalH"/> After a stint as a [[private investigator]] (a role he plays in his [[1991 in film|1991]] film, ''[[The Last Boy Scout]]''), Willis returned to his original passion of acting. He enrolled in the drama program at [[Montclair State University]], where he was cast in the class production of ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' with [[Jack Prince]] as Big Daddy, [[William Applegate]] as the doctor, and [[Kevin J. Lynch]] as the Rev. Tooker. The ambitious junior finally decided to leave school in pursuit of more movie roles by heading for [[New York City]].<ref name="DailyM"/>

Willis returned to the bar scene, only this time for a part-time job and as a way to meet New York [[celebrity|celebrities]]. He is rumored to have been <nowiki>'</nowiki>discovered<nowiki>'</nowiki> while working at the Museum Cafe on New York's Upper West Side. After countless [[audition]]s, Willis made his theater debut in the [[off-Broadway]] production of ''Heaven and Earth''. He gained more experience and exposure in ''[[Fool for Love]]'', a stint on [[television]]'s ''[[Miami Vice]]'', and in a [[Levi's]] [[commercial]].<ref name="YahooM"/><!-- <ref>Commercial is shown at the end of the clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bytZyUNyE</ref> -->

==Career==
Willis left New York City and headed to [[California]] to audition for several television shows.<ref name="DailyM"/> He auditioned for the [[Television program|TV series]] ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' (1985&ndash;89), while competing against 3,000 other actors for the position and was selected to play David Addison Jr.<ref name="YahooM">{{cite web | title=Yahoo! Movies|work= Bruce Willis Biography|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018749/bio | accessdate=June 21|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The starring role helped to establish him as a [[comedy|comedic]] actor, with the show lasting five seasons.  During the height of the show's success, beverage maker [[Seagram]] hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden Wine Cooler products.  The memorable ad campaign paid the rising star between five and seven million dollars over two years. In spite of that, Willis decided not renew his contract with the company when he decided to stop drinking in 1988.<ref name="Playboy">{{Citation |last=Grobel|first=Lawrence|title=Playboy Interview: Bruce Willis|newspaper=Playboy|pages=59-79|year=1988|date=November 1988|accessdate=June 27}}</ref>

However, it was his then-unexpected turn in the film ''[[Die Hard]]'' that catapulted him to fame. He performed most of his own [[stunt]]s in the film,<ref name="People1">{{cite web | title=People.com | work=Bruce Willis: Biography
| url=http://www.people.com/people/bruce_willis/biography | accessdate=June 20 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> and the film grossed $138,708,852 worldwide.<ref name="BOM1">{{cite web | title=Box Office Mojo|work=Die Hard|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=diehard.htm | accessdate=June 20|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Due to its box office success, the film would eventually tender three more sequels, with the most current film, ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'', released in [[June 2007]]. He also provided his voice for a talking baby in ''[[Look Who's Talking]]'' and its sequel.

In the late-1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a [[recording artist]], recording an album of pop-blues entitled ''The Return of Bruno'', which included the hit single "Respect Yourself",<ref name="TopSongs">{{cite web | title=The Eighties Club|work=Top 100 Songs of 1987|url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id224.htm | accessdate=June 23|accessyear=2007}}</ref> promoted by a [[Spinal Tap]]-like [[rockumentary]] [[parody]] featuring scenes of him performing at famous events including [[Woodstock]]. Follow-up recordings were not as successful, though Willis has returned to the recording studio several times.

In the early [[1990s in film|1990s]], Willis' career suffered a moderate slump starring in [[flop|flops]] such as ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' and a film he co-wrote entitled ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'', among others. However, in [[1994 in film|1994]] he had a supporting role in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s acclaimed ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which gave a new boost to his career.

However, by the end of the 1990s, his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like ''[[The Jackal]]'', ''[[Mercury Rising]]'', and ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', saved only by the success of the [[Michael Bay]]-directed ''[[Armageddon (film)|Armageddon]]'' which was the highest grossing film of [[1998 in film|1998]] worldwide.<ref name="BOM2">{{cite web | title=Box Office Mojo|work=1998 WORLDWIDE GROSSES| url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=1998&p=.htm | accessdate=June 21|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the [[PlayStation]] video game ''[[Apocalypse (video game)|Apocalypse]]''.<ref name="EWeekly">{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly|work="Apocalypse" Now| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,286028,00.html | accessdate=June 21|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

In [[1999 in film|1999]], Willis then went on to the starring role in [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s film, ''[[The Sixth Sense]]''. The film was both a commercial and critical success and helped to increase interest in his acting career.

He won a 2000 [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on ''Friends'' (in which he played the father of [[Ross Geller]]'s much-younger girlfriend). He was also nominated for a 2001 American Comedy Award (in the Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series category) for his work on ''Friends''. Willis was originally cast as Terry Benedict in ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' ([[2001 in film|2001]]) but dropped out to work on recording an album. In ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]), he makes a [[cameo appearance]] as himself. He recently appeared in the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' half of the double feature ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' as the [[villain]], a mutant soldier. This marks Willis' second collaboration with [[director]] [[Robert Rodriguez]], following ''[[Sin City]]''.

Willis has appeared on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' several times throughout his career.

On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the [[The Gates|Central Park gates]], having one side of his face made up with simulated [[buckshot]] wounds after the [[Harry Whittington]] shooting, or trying to break a record (parody of [[David Blaine]]) of staying underwater for only 20 seconds.

Tying in with this, Subaru did a limited run of Legacys, badged "Subaru Legacy Touring Bruce", in honor of Willis.

Willis has appeared in four movies with [[Samuel L. Jackson]] (National Lampoon's ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', and ''[[Unbreakable]]'') and both actors were slated to work together in ''[[Black Water Transit]]'' before dropping out.

:<blockquote>"Organized [[religion]]s in general, in my opinion, are dying forms", he says. "They were all very important when we didn't know why the [[sun]] moved, why [[weather]] changed, why [[hurricane]]s occurred, or [[volcano]]es happened", he continues. "Modern religion is the end trail of modern [[mythology]]. But there are people who interpret the [[Bible]] literally. Literally!" he says incredulously. "I choose not to believe that's the way.

Willis was one of few Hollywood celebrities to publicly support the [[Iraq War]] in 2003, but in 2007 declared that he was more supportive of the troops instead of the war itself.<ref name="HindustanT">{{cite web | title=Hindustan Times | work=I am not in favour of Iraq war, says Bruce Willis| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=ae0b148d-5f5b-44d2-8391-7a610e988da1&ParentID=7e24c85b-2ae1-4e55-9503-a411339de817&&Headline=I+don't+suppoprt+Iraq+war%3a+Bruce+Willis | accessdate=June 24 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> He has endorsed every [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate except [[Bob Dole]] in 1996, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the movie ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]''.<ref name="ipaki"/> Willis was an invited speaker at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]].<ref name="CNNarchives">{{cite web | title=CNN | work=Bush and Cheney head toward Philadelphia as party vanguard makes preparations | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/28/convention.wrap/index.html | accessdate=June 24 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>  Willis has attempted to play down his status as one of Hollywood's most outspoken [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], although he continues to vocally support gun ownership and other [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] policies. In February 2006, Willis appeared in Manhattan to talk about his new movie ''[[16 Blocks]]'' with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on current events but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence:

:<blockquote>"I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of... every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn [[lobbyist]]s out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican... I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down.

:<blockquote>"Everyone has a right to bear arms. If you take guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who have guns are the bad guys."

In 2002, Willis's youngest daughter, Tallulah, suggested that Willis purchase [[Girl Scout cookies]] to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were given to sailors aboard [[USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)|USS ''John F.

Willis has also bashed the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war: <blockquote>"...I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers &mdash; young kids for the most part &mdash; helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news.
