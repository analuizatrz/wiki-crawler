'''Procellariiformes''' (from the Latin ''procella'', a storm) is an order of [[bird]]s formerly called '''Tubinares''' and still called '''tubenoses''' in English. 

==Description==
They are all highly pelagic [[seabird]]s (feeding in the open ocean), and all of them have their nostrils enclosed in one or two tubes on their straight, deeply grooved bills with hooked tips. The beaks are made up from several plates. Wings are long and narrow; feet are webbed, and the hind toe is undeveloped or non-existent. Plumage is predominantly black or gray.

The tubes may be used to smell or to excrete salt when these birds drink salt water.

The longer-winged species fly using a switchback technique to minimise active flapping. All eat fish, [[squid]] or similar marine prey.

Most are almost unable to walk on land, and many species visit their remote breeding islands only at night. The exceptions are the huge albatrosses, several of the gadfly petrels and shearwaters and the fulmar-petrels. The latter can disable even large predatory birds with their obnoxious [[stomach oil]], which they can project some distance. This stomach oil is a digestive residue created in the foregut of all tubenoses except the diving petrels, and is used mainly for storage of energy rich food as well as for defence.

==Species==
There are a total of 93 species of Procellariiformes world-wide, divided among four families:

* Order Procellariiformes
** Family [[Procellariidae]] ([[shearwater]]s, [[fulmarine petrel]]s, [[gadfly petrel]]s, and [[prion (bird)|prion]]s)
** Family [[Diomedeidae]] ([[albatross]]es)
** Family [[Hydrobatidae]] ([[storm-petrel]]s)
** Family [[Pelecanoididae]] ([[diving petrel]]s)

The Hydrobatidae's two subfamilies, Oceanitinadae and Hydrobatinae, are probably better treated as distinct families (Nunn & Stanley 1998).

Procellariiformes are most closely related to [[Sphenisciformes]] (Penguins).

In the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]], the tubenoses are included in a greatly enlarged order ''Ciconiiformes''. This [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] treatment is almost certainly erroneous, but the assumption of a close evolutionary relationship may be correct{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.
