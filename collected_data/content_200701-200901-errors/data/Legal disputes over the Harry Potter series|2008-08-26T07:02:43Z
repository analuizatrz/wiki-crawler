Since first coming to wide notice in the late 1990s, the '''''[[Harry Potter]]''''' book series by [[J. K. Rowling]] has engendered a number of '''legal disputes'''. Rowling, her publishers and [[Time Warner]], the owner of the rights to the [[Harry Potter films]], have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves.<ref name="Potter author zaps court rival">{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/UK/09/19/rowling.court/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=Potter author zaps court rival|date=2002-09-19|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> The worldwide popularity of the ''Harry Potter'' series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.<ref name=yemets><span class="plainlinks">[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2846105.stm "Rowling seeks 'Grotter' ban"].

Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release date. These injunctions have very sweeping powers and have occasionally drawn fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the "right to read".<ref name="Don't Buy Harry Potter Books">{{cite news|url=http://stallman.org/harry-potter.html|title=Don't Buy Harry Potter Books|date=2005-07-13|accessdate=2007-03-13|last=Stallman|first=Richard}}</ref><ref name= geist>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Right to Read|author=Michael Geist|url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=896|year=2005|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>   The powers afforded by these injunctions have even been used in subsequent cases unrelated to publishing.<ref name=injunction>{{cite web|title=Hampshire Waste Services Ltd v.

Outside these controversies, a number of particular incidents related to ''Harry Potter'' have also led, or almost led, to legal action. In 2005 a man was sentenced to four years in prison after an altercation with a weapon over stolen pages from an unreleased ''Harry Potter'' novel,<ref name=corby>{{cite web|title= Harry Potter thief sent to prison|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4620000/newsid_4628100/4628144.stm|year=2006|work=CBBC Newsround|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> while in 2007 [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] came close to legal action against the supermarket chain [[Asda]] for libel after the company accused them of overpricing the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite web|title=Asda barred from selling seventh Harry Potter|author=Nigel Reynolds|work=The Telegraph|year=2007|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/17/npotter117.xml|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

== Allegations of copyright and trademark infringement==
[[Image:Rahmuggles.jpg|thumb|150 px|''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'']]
===Nancy Stouffer===
In 1999, [[United States|American]] author Nancy Kathleen Stouffer quietly began to allege [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] [[infringement]] by Rowling of her 1984 works ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'' (ISBN 1-58989-400-6) and ''Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly''.<ref name="Potter author zaps court rival" />

The primary basis for Stouffer's case rested in her own purported invention of the word "Muggles", non-magical elongated [[humanoids]], in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'', and Larry Potter, the title character of a series of activity booklets for children. Larry Potter, like Harry Potter, is a bespectacled boy with dark hair.<ref name="Muggle Versus Wizard"/> Despite the reports of some news agencies,<ref>{{cite web|title=Larry Potter returns to print|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1224264.stm|year=2001|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref> Larry Potter is not a character in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles''.<ref>{{cite web|title='Harry Potter' Prevails In Court|author=Hillel Italie|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/19/print/main522563.shtml|year=2002|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> Stouffer also drew a number of other comparisons, such as a castle on a lake, a receiving room and wooden doors.<ref name="Muggle Versus Wizard">{{cite news|url=http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/zforum/01/author_stouffer032801.htm|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Muggle Versus Wizard|date=2001-03-28|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Portions of ''Rah'' were originally published in booklet form by Ande Publishing Company in 1986, a company founded by Ms. Stouffer together with a group of friends and family.<ref name="opinion">[http://www.authorslawyer.com/case/02USDL17531.html ''Scholastic, Inc., et al. v.

Rowling, along with [[Scholastic Press]] (her American publisher) and [[Warner Bros.]] (holders of the series' film rights), pre-empted Stouffer with a suit of their own seeking a declaratory judgment that they had not infringed on any of Stouffer's works. During the course of the trial, it was proven "by clear and convincing  evidence, that Stouffer has perpetrated a fraud on the Court through her submission of fraudulent documents as well as through her untruthful testimony,"<ref name=Kurnit>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter And The Uncommon Award|author= Jessie Beeber and Edward Rosenthal |work=Frankfurt Kurnit Klein and Seltz PC|url=http://www.fkkslaw.com/article.asp?articleID=62|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> including changing pages years after the fact to retroactively insert the word "muggle".<ref name=Kurnit>

Her case was dismissed with prejudice and she was fined $50,000 for her "pattern of intentional bad faith conduct" in relation to her employment of fraudulent submissions, along with being ordered to pay a portion of the plaintiffs' legal fees.<ref name=Kurnit/> Stouffer appealed the decision in 2004, but the appeals court upheld the ruling, stating that "no reasonable juror could find a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the two parties' works".<ref name="opinion" />

''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'' is currently out of print. In the spring of 2001, it was published by Thurman House, LLC, a Maryland publishing company.<ref name="opinion" />  Thurman House, formed by Ottenheimer Publishers to republish the works of Nancy Stouffer, was closed when Ottenheimer ceased operations in 2002 after filing for bankruptcy.<ref name="pw">[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA222465.html?pubdate=6%2F17%2F2002&display=archive Ottenheimer Closing Down, ''Publishers Weekly'', [[June 17]], [[2002]]]</ref> Ms. Stouffer later asserted that any copies of the book published by Thurman House are unauthorized because the publisher failed to honour its contractual obligations to her.<ref name= "unauth">{{cite web|title=realmuggles.com|author=Nancy Stouffer|url=http://www.realmuggles.com/action.html#notice1|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> She states on her website that she is planning to republish her books and is entertaining the possibility of another lawsuit against Warner Bros., J. K. Rowling and Scholastic Press.<ref name= "unauth" />

Rowling vehemently denied Stouffer's claims. "I am deeply offended that my integrity and good character have been besmirched by the ludicrous allegations that I stole [anything]", she said during the court case.<ref>Glovin, David.

===Claire Field===
In 2000, in the lead-up to the release of the first ''Harry Potter'' film, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Warner Bros., the film's distributor, sent a series of threatening letters to owners of ''Harry Potter'' fansites, demanding that, to protect their copyright, they hand over their domain names.<ref>{{cite web|title=AOL-Time Warner threatens children running Harry Potter fan sites|author=Mike Ingram|work=World Socialist Web Site|year=2001|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/feb2001/pott-f28.shtml|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> 
The action resulted in negative publicity for the company when Claire Field, the then 15-year-old webmaster of the British fansite [http://www.harrypotterguide.co.uk/ harrypotterguide.co.uk], was reduced to tears by what were described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics. Eventually the corporation backed down in the face of media opposition and declared that, as the site was non-commercial, it did not violate the trademark.<ref name=Claire /><ref>{{cite web|title=Warner Bros backs down on Harry Potter Web site|author=Kieren McCarthy|work=The Register|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/12/15/warner_bros_backs_down/ |year=2000|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>

===Unauthorised Chinese ''Harry Potter'' books===
[[Image:Harry-potter chinese 070502.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Harry Potter and Leopard-Walk-Up-to-Dragon'']]
In 2002, an unauthorised [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] sequel titled ''Harry Potter and Leopard-Walk-Up-to-Dragon'' appeared for sale in the [[People's Republic of China]]. 

According to translated excerpts, almost the entire book consists of the [[verbatim]] text of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] with most names changed to those of ''Harry Potter'' characters.<ref name="i">

The book was quickly recognised as fake. Rowling (as well as movie rights holder [[Warner Bros.]]) took steps to stop its distribution.<ref name="i" /> Copies were briefly distributed around the world, including [[e-book]] copies traded on the [[internet]]. When the actual novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' was released in [[2003]], interest in the unauthorized book quickly faded.

In November, 2002, the Bashu Publishing House, in the southwestern city of [[Chengdu]], agreed to pay a £1,600 (~US$3,400) fine and publish an apology in China's Legal Times for printing and distributing the novel.<ref name="t">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article820428.ece Legal magic spells win for Harry in China] Oliver August and Jack Malvern, The Times, November 2, 2002</ref> As of 2007, the identity of the anonymous "author" has not been discovered. The opening of ''Harry Potter and Leopard-Walk-Up-to-Dragon'', translated into English, was included in several news articles.<ref name="t" />

Also in 2002, the China Braille Publishing House published ''Harry Potter and the Porcelain Doll''. It is estimated that there are fifteen million fraudulent ''Harry Potter'' novels circulating in China today.<ref name=China>{{cite web|title=What is the seventh Potter book called in China?|author=Howard W French|work=International Harald Tribune|year=2007|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/08/01/asia/01china.php|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>
In 2007, [[Christopher Little Literary Agency|Christopher Little]], Rowling's literary agents, began to discuss the possibility of legal proceedings concerning a fake version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' that appeared in China ten days before the actual book's publication.<ref name=China />

===Dimitry Yemets===

[[Image:Tanya Grotter.jpg|thumb|150 px|Tanya Grotter]]
In 2003, courts in the [[Netherlands]] prevented the distribution of a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translation of ''Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass'', the first of [[Dimitry Yemets]]' popular [[Russian language|Russian]] series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate [[copyright]] law. Yemets and his original [[Moscow]]-based publishers, [[Eksmo]], argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright.<ref name=yemets /> The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus were not allowed to be sold in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rowling blocks Grotter release|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2914111.stm|year=2003|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> 

Later that year, as the Dutch translation ''Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas'' was still legal in Belgium, the [[Flemish Region|Flemish]] publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was [[plagiarism]], hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue.<ref name=Dutch>[http://www.nieuws.nl/bericht/4/40972 'Tanja Grotter' wel in België te lezen], ''Nieuws.nl'', [[October 23]], [[2003]] (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]])</ref>  Rowling did not sue, but as there was a lot of interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out.<ref name=Dutch /> The books remain popular in Russia and have spawned several sequels, as well as numerous adaptations and much merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter triumphs over Russians|work=Briffa creative law|url=http://www.briffa.com/news/art57potter.htm|year=2003|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

In their May, 2004 issue, the [[US Army]] publication, the ''[[Preventive Maintenance Monthly]]'', which instructs soldiers on how to maintain their equipment, featured a spoof comic based on ''Harry Potter'', featuring a character named Topper who resided at Mogmarts School under Professor Rumbledore.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Preventive Maintenance Monthly|year=2004|url=https://www.logsa.army.mil/pub/psissues/PS_618.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>  The publication received notice from Rowling's lawyers that the comics breached copyright, though the magazine's editor, Ken Crunk, claimed that no violation had taken place, as "[t]he drawings do not look like any of the characters from Harry Potter".<ref>{{cite web|title=Army mag draws Potter comparisons|year=2005|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4243145.stm|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>

===Kolkata lawsuit===
In October 2007, Warner Bros. sued a group constructing a facade during a  [[Hindu]] [[Durga puja|religious festival]] in the Indian city of [[Kolkata]] for two million rupees ($50,000), claiming that they had erected a giant replica of Harry Potter's school, [[Hogwarts]], without their permission.

In November 2007, Rowling discussed the case on her website, listing the rumours that she had targeted a non-profit organisation as "Toxic" and saying, "The defendants were not religious charities, and theirs was not a religious celebration. On the contrary, it was a large-scale, commercial, sponsored event involving corporations that included a major Indian high street bank. The event was, however, set up while a Hindu festival was going on ... The court ruled that Warner Bros. rights had indeed been infringed, and that events such as the one in question would need Warner Bros.' permission in the future. The court also restrained all the defendants from any future events infringing Warner Bros. rights."<ref>{{cite web|title=Rubbish Bin: J K Rowling demands 2 million rupees from religious charities in India|work=jkrowling.com|author=JK Rowling|year=2007|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rubbishbin_view.cfm?id=17|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>

==Legal injunctions==
There have been a series of legal [[injunction]]s brought by Rowling and her publishers to ensure the books' secrecy before their launch. These injunctions have drawn criticism from [[civil liberties]] campaigners over their potentially sweeping powers over individual freedoms.

In 2003, in an attempt to maintain secrecy over the impending release of the fifth ''Harry Potter'' book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against "the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants".<ref name=injunction /> The ruling obtained, for the first time  in British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, "The new Harry Potter style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, so long as you could find a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified 'those who are included and those who are not'".<ref name=injunction /> This principle was later used against a camp of [[Romani people|Roma]] travellers.<ref name=injunction /> In 2006, pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animal extremists can no longer hide behind a web of secrecy|author=Dan Tench|work=Timesonline|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article722258.ece|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

The series garnered more controversy in 2005 with the release of the sixth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', when a [[Real Canadian Superstore]] grocery store accidentally sold several copies before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, [[Raincoast Books]], obtained an injunction from the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] prohibiting the purchasers from reading the books in their possession. A comment by media lawyer Korieh Duodu that "there is no human right to read" led to a debate in the public sphere about whether free access to information was a human right.<ref name=geist /><ref>{{cite web|title=Reading ban on leaked Harry Potter|author=Jack Malvern|work=Timesonline|year=2005|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article543318.ece|accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref> Free-speech activist [[Richard Stallman]] posted a statement on his blog calling for a boycott until the publisher issues an apology.<ref name="Don't Buy Harry Potter Books" /> Solicitors Fraser Milner and Casgrain, who represented Raincoast and formulated the legal argument for the embargo,<ref>{{cite web|title=Important Notice: Raincoast Books|url=http://www.raincoast.com/harrypotter/injunction-commentary.html|year=2005|accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref>  have rebutted this, saying that the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] applies only to the government, not to private litigation, and does not offer any protection of the right to read in any case, and the innocent purchasers of the ''Harry Potter'' book had no more right to read it than if they had come into possession of someone's secret diary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Understanding the Harry Potter Injunction: Protecting Copyright and Confidential Information|author=Barbara Grossman, Aaron Milrad and Annie Na|work=Fraser Milner and Casgrain|url=http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/655380_HarryPotterInjunction_October21_2005.pdf|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>  

In 2007, [[Scholastic Corporation]] threatened legal action against two booksellers, Levy Home Entertainment and DeepDiscount.com, for selling copies of the final novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' before its release date of [[July 21]]. In an official statement,  Scholastic made an appeal "to the Harry Potter fans who bought their books from DeepDiscount.com and may receive copies early requesting that they keep the packages hidden until midnight on [[July 21]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Scholastic will take action against Harry Potter distributors|work=Reuters|year=2007|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070718/media_nm/scholastic_harrypotter_dc_1;_ylt=AvVNO5KxE6R2vS5hZzA0WgtY24cA|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref>
Customers who agreed not to read the book received a special Harry Potter t-shirt and a $50 coupon for Scholastic's online store.

In June 2005, Aaron Lambert, a security guard at a book distribution centre in [[Corby]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]], stole a number of pages from ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' six weeks before its intended publication date. He was arrested a day later after negotiations to sell them to John Askill, a journalist from ''[[The Sun]]'', turned violent. Lambert reportedly fired a shot from his imitation [[Walther PPK]] pistol, but Mr. Askill was unharmed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guard admits to Harry Potter theft|work=JR Roberts Security Strategies|url=http://www.jrrobertssecurity.com/security-news/security-crime-news0082.htm|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>  At his trial the following October, Lambert pleaded guilty to threatening Mr. Askill and to attempting to blackmail ''Harry Potter'''s publishers, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Potter book thief admits threats|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4546164.stm|work=BBC News|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> In January 2006, Lambert was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.<ref>{{cite web|title= Harry Potter thief sent to prison|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4620000/newsid_4628100/4628144.stm|year=2006|work=CBBC Newsround|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

===Accusation of libel===
In July 2007, a dispute arose between ''Harry Potter'''s British publisher, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], and [[Asda]], a British supermarket chain owned by the US corporation [[Wal-Mart]]. On [[July 15]], a week before the release of the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Asda issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was "holding children to ransom" and that, "[i]t seems like Bloomsbury need to do a [[Quidditch|quid-ditch]] as they have sent their prices up north on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. By setting the RRP at this level can only be seen [''sic''] as blatant profiteering on their part."<ref name=telegraph /> Pritchard went on to say that Asda was acting to "champion the right of young readers", and that the RRP was "twice the average child's pocket money and £5 more than the average children's bestseller."<ref name=telegraph /> Asda had planned to sell the book as a [[loss leader]] at £8.87, or half Bloomsbury's [[recommended retail price]] of £17.99 and below the [[wholesale]] price of £9.89.<ref>{{cite web|title=Potter book firm clashes with supermarket over price|work=TimesOnline|year=2007|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2089458.ece|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

Two days later, Bloomsbury responded that the claims were "potentially libellous" and that:
<blockquote>
Asda's latest attempt to draw attention to themselves involves trying to leap on the ''Harry Potter'' bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and have nothing to do with Bloomsbury Publishing or ''Harry Potter'' and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.<ref name=telegraph /> 
</blockquote>
Bloomsbury stated that the price hike of £1 from the previous ''Harry Potter'' novel was due to it having been printed on recycled paper. "There is a price to be paid by the consumer for environmental best practice", a Bloomsbury spokeswoman said.<ref name=makepeace>{{cite web|title=Bloomsbury: Asda must make peace|author=Katherine Rushton|work=thebookseller.com|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42122-bloomsbury-asda-must-make-peace.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

Bloomsbury CEO Nigel Newton said, "[t]hey've unleashed a very disingenuous, self-interested attack on us. This is complete nonsense and all they're doing is grandstanding as they've done on the price of aspirin and bread. They try to turn it into a big deal as though it's a moral crusade for them, but it's nothing of the kind."<ref name=makepeace />

That same day, Bloomsbury cancelled all Asda's orders of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills from the company totalling £38,000 for unauthorised returns of the sixth ''Harry Potter'' book.<ref name=makepeace /> "The two matters are completely unrelated", said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, "We decided today that we couldn't risk having arrears with anybody."<ref name=telegraph /> The dispute had been "going on a while - going on for weeks actually."<ref name=lifestyle>{{cite web|title=Asda Apologises following Potter Book Row|work=UK News Lifestyle Extra|url=http://www.lse.co.uk/ShowStory.asp?story=BZ1739815T&news_headline=asda_apologises_following_potter_book_row__|year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 ("for pulping and for other book trade issues and work we have done for them"<ref name=makepeace />) and that, as one company spokesman claimed, "It just seems funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying everything they can to stop kids getting hold of ''Harry Potter'' at a price they can afford."<ref name=lifestyle /> 

Asda paid the bill within hours, and claimed that Bloomsbury would be in breach of contract if it did not allow the store to sell its books. However, Bloomsbury claimed that the block on Asda's orders was still in place as, "Unfortunately, we've now had to initiate a significant libel claim against them. That matter will have to be dealt with. If they want their 500,000 books, they'll have to come and make peace with us... It could be good news for all their disappointed customers, because they don't have to go to a soulless Asda shed to buy their book and they can share the magic of Harry Potter at an independent or specialist bookstore instead."<ref name=makepeace /> 

Upon receipt of Bloomsbury's legal letter, Asda responded that, "There is nothing defamatory in our press release. Everything there is factual. It is a commentary on how we see things."<ref name=makepeace /> Said another Asda spokesperson, "If they don't supply us with the books, it will have a massive implication and [be] a breach of contract - but I don't think they will do that."<ref name=makepeace />

Later that day, however, Asda released a statement retracting its original comment: "We apologise unreservedly to Bloomsbury for [our] press release dated [[July 15]] and withdraw our statement. We look forward to a good relationship with Bloomsbury going forward, including selling the latest ''Harry Potter'' book from 00:01am BST on Saturday 21 July and many other Bloomsbury books in the future".<ref>{{cite web|title=Asda apologises to Bloomsbury|author= Philip Jones |work=thebookseller.com|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42186-asda-apologises-to-bloomsbury.html|year=2007|accessate=2007-08-01}}</ref> In response, Bloomsbury lifted the block and Asda was allowed to sell its books. The original press release was then expunged.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Asda Apology|author=Graeme Warden|work=Guardian Unlimited|year=2007|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2128240,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> 

The rationale behind Asda's initial press release remains uncertain.  Neill Denny, commentator for thebookseller.com, opined that "the whole episode has the whiff of a badly-conceived PR stunt by ill-briefed senior executives at Asda out of touch with the subtleties of the book world."<ref name=Denny>{{cite web|title=Opinion: Asda's climbdown|author=Neill Denny|work=thebookseller.com|year=2007|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42197-opinion-asdas-climbdown.html|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: "For Asda... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its ''Harry Potter'' offer rewarded with television, radio, internet and newspaper coverage. And the association of Asda with low prices has no doubt been entrenched in a few more minds."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Great Stand-Off|author=Ralph Baxter|work=Publishing News Online|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071113192945/http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2007071912471094&TAG=&CID=&PGE=&sg9t=...|year=2007|accessate=2007-08-01}}</ref>
