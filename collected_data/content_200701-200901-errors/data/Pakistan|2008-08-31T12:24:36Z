<!-- THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY. CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF PAKISTAN' ARTICLE.-->
{{Main|History of Pakistan}}

[[Image:Mohenjo-daro Priesterkönig.jpeg|thumb|100px|left|"The Priest King" Wearing Sindhi Ajruk, ca. 2500 BC. National Museum, Karachi, Pakistan]]
From the earliest period of pre-history and recorded history of the region, modern Pakistan formed the heart-land of a larger territory, extending beyond its present eastern and western borders and receiving momentous and mighty impacts from both the directions.

The [[Indus River|Indus region]], which covers much of Pakistan, was the site of several ancient cultures including the Neolithic era [[Mehrgarh]] and the Bronze era [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (2500 BCE &ndash; 1500 BCE) at [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]].<ref name="indus_valley">[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/mohenjo_daro.html Minnesota State University page on Mohenjo-Daro]</ref>

Waves of conquerors and migrants from the west &mdash; including Harappan, [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]], [[Persian empire|Persian]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Saka]], [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Hephthalite]], [[Demography of Afghanistan|Afghan]], [[Arab]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkics]], and [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] &mdash; settled in the region through out the centuries, influencing the locals and being absorbed among them. Great ancient empires of the east &mdash; such as [[Nanda Dynasty|Nandas]], [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]], and [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]] &mdash; ruled these territories at different times. However, in the medieval period, while the eastern provinces of Punjab and Sindh became aligned with [[Islam in India|Indo-Islamic civilisation]], the western areas became culturally allied with the [[Iranian peoples|Iranic civilisation]] of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]].<ref name="Almanac">{{cite book| last=Wright| first=John W.| title=Universal Almanac| publisher=Andrews & McMeel Publishing| date=1997| location=New York| isbn=0836221877}}</ref> The region served as crossroads of historic trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]], and as a maritime entreport, for the coastal trade between [[Mesopotamia]] and beyond up to [[Rome]] in the west and [[Malabar]] and beyond up to [[China]] in the east.

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] collapsed in the middle of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]], which also extended over much of the Indo-Gangetic plains. Successive ancient empires and kingdoms ruled the region: the [[Achaemenid]] Persian empire<ref name="achaemenid">[http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/achaemenians.html Livius.org on the extent of the Achaemenid Empire]</ref> around 543 BCE, Greek empire founded by [[Alexander the Great]]<ref name="plutarch">[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/8.html#ref98 Plutarch's ''Life of Alexander'']</ref> in 326 BCE and the [[Mauryan]] empire there after. The [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] founded by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius of Bactria]] included [[Gandhara]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] from 184 BCE, and reached its greatest extent under [[Menander I|Menander]], establishing the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] period with advances in trade and culture. The city of [[Taxila]] (Takshashila) became a major centre of learning in ancient times &mdash; the remains of the city, located to the west of [[Islamabad]], are one of the country's major [[archaeological site]]s. The [[Rai Dynasty]] (c.489&ndash;632) of [[Sindh]], at its zenith, ruled this region and the surrounding territories.

In 712 [[Common Era|CE]], the Arab general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]]<ref name="qasim">[http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITChachnamaframeset.htm Infinity Foundation's translation of the Chach-Nama]</ref> conquered [[Sindh]] and [[Multan]] in southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The Pakistan government's official chronology states that "its foundation was laid" as a result of this conquest.<ref name="Information of Pakistan"> {{cite web | title= History in Chronological Order | publisher= Government of Pakistan |url=http://www.infopak.gov.pk/History.aspx}}</ref> This [[Arab]] and [[Islam]]ic victory would set the stage for several successive Muslim empires in South Asia, including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]], the [[Muhammad of Ghor|Ghorid]] Kingdom, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire]]. During this period, [[Sufi]] missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu population to [[Islam]]. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century provided opportunities for the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]], [[Balochis]] and [[Sikh]]s to exercise control over large areas until the [[British East India Company]]<ref name="east_india">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pktoc.html Library of Congress study of Pakistan]</ref> gained ascendancy over South Asia.

[[Image:SepoyMutiny.jpg|thumb|right|180px|An engraving titled "Sepoy Indian troops dividing the spoils after their mutiny against British rule" gives a contemporary view of events from the British perspective.]]
The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|War of Independence 1857]], also known as the ''Sepoy Mutiny'', was the region's last major armed struggle against the foreign [[British Raj]] and it laid the foundations for the generally unarmed freedom struggle, led by the Hindu dominated [[Indian National Congress]], in the twentieth century. The [[All India Muslim League]] rose to popularity in the late 1930s amid fears of under-representation and neglect of Muslims in politics. On [[29 December]] [[1930]], [[Allama Iqbal]]'s presidential address called for an autonomous "state in northwestern India for Indian Muslims, within the body politic of India."<ref name="iqbal1">{{cite web| url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/txt_iqbal_1930.html| title=Sir Muhammad Iqbal's 1930 Presidential Address| work=Speeches, Writings, and Statements of Iqbal| accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] espoused the ''[[Two Nation Theory]]'' and led the Muslim League to adopt the ''[[Lahore Resolution]]'' of 1940 (popularly known as the [[Pakistan Resolution]]), which ultimately led to the formation of an independent Pakistan. The Indian independence movement, led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], demanded freedom from British rule.  In early 1947, Britain, coming under strong pressure from other Western nations to end its violent suppression of the freedom movement, decided to end its rule of India.

[[Image:GGJinnah.jpg|thumb|left|[[Governor General]] [[Jinnah]] delivering the opening address on [[11 August]] [[1947]] to the new state of Pakistan.]]
In June 1947, the nationalist leaders of [[British India]] &mdash; including Nehru and [[Abul Kalam Azad]] on behalf of the Congress, Jinnah representing the Muslim League, [[B. R. Ambedkar]] representing the [[Dalit|Untouchable]] community, and [[Master Tara Singh]] representing the [[Sikhs]] &mdash; agreed to the proposed terms of transfer of power and independence. The modern state of Pakistan was established on [[14 August]] [[1947]] (27 [[Ramadan]] 1366 in the [[Islamic Calendar]]), carved out of the two Muslim-majority wings in the eastern and northwestern regions of [[British India]] and comprising the provinces of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[East Bengal]], the [[North-West Frontier Province]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|West Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]. The controversial division of the provinces of Punjab and Bengal set the stage for communal riots across India and Pakistan &mdash; millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan and millions of Hindus and [[Sikhs]] moved to India. Disputes arose over several [[princely state]]s including Muslim-majority [[Kashmir and Jammu]], whose ruler had acceded to India following an invasion by Pashtun warriors, leading to the [[First Kashmir War]] in 1948.

From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a [[Dominion]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It became a Republic in 1956, but the civilian rule was stalled by a [[coup d’état]] by General [[Ayub Khan]], who was president during 1958&ndash;69, a period of internal instability and a [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|second war]] with India in 1965. His successor, [[Yahya Khan]] (1969&ndash;71) had to deal with a devastating [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] &mdash; which caused 500,000 deaths in East Pakistan &mdash; and also face a civil war in 1971.

Economic greivances and political dissent in [[East Pakistan]] led to violent political tension and military repression that escalated into a [[civil war]],<ref name="1971war">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/south_asia/2002/india_pakistan/timeline/1971.stm 1971 war summary by BBC website]</ref> which invited covert and later overt Indian intervention that escalated into the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and ultimately to the secession of East Pakistan as the independent state of [[Bangladesh]].<ref name="Bangladesh">http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/17.htm US Country Studies article on the Bangladesh War]</ref> Estimates of the number of people killed during this episode vary greatly, from ~30,000 to over 2&nbsp;million, depending on the source.

[[Image:PAK1971.jpg|thumb|The two wings of Pakistan in 1970; [[East Pakistan]] separated from the West wing in 1971 as an independent [[Bangladesh]].]]
Civilian rule resumed in Pakistan from 1972 to 1977, under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], until he was deposed and later sentenced to death, (in what his followers claimed was a judicial murder), in 1979 by General [[Zia-ul-Haq]], who became the country's third military president. Pakistan's [[secular]] policies were replaced by Zia's introduction of the Islamic [[Sharia]]h legal code, which increased religious influences on the civil service and the military. With the death of President Zia in a plane crash in 1988, [[Benazir Bhutto]], daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. Over the next decade, she alternated power with [[Nawaz Sharif]], as the country's political and economic situation worsened. Pakistan got invoved in the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and sent 5,000 troops as part of a US led coalition, specifically for the defence of [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name="gulf_war">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/09/24/MN168392.DTL The 1991 Gulf war]</ref> Military tensions in the [[Kargil War|Kargil conflict]]<ref name="kargil">{{cite news

In 2001, Musharraf became [[President of Pakistan|President]] after the controversial resignation of [[Rafiq Tarar]]. After the 2002 parliamentary elections, Musharraf transferred executive powers to newly elected Prime Minister [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]], who was succeeded in the 2004 Prime-Ministerial election by [[Shaukat Aziz]] and was followed, for a temporary period in office, by [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]]. On 15th November, 2007 the National Assembly completed its tenure and so, pending elections, a caretaker government was appointed with the former Chairman of the Senate, [[Muhammad Mian Soomro]] as caretaker Prime Minister. However, the December 2007 [[assassination of Benazir Bhutto]] during election campaign led to postponement of elections and also underscored the then prevailing instability of Pakistan's political system. After the parliamentary elections held in march, [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] was sworn in as Prime Minister .<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7312116.stm New Pakistan PM Gillani sworn in] &mdash; Accessed 25 March 2008</ref>

==Government and politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Government of Pakistan|Politics of Pakistan}}
[[Image:Pakistani parliament house.jpg|thumb|right|Parliament house in [[Islamabad]]]]
The government of Pakistan was based on the [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act (1935)]] for the first nine years after independence. The first [[Constitution of Pakistan]] was adopted in 1956, but was suspended in 1958 by General [[Ayub Khan]]. The Constitution of 1973 - suspended in 1977, by [[Zia-ul-Haq]], but re-instated in 1991 - is the country's most important document, laying the foundations of government. Pakistan is a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[Federal republic|federal]] [[democratic]] [[republic]] with [[Islam]] as the state religion. The [[bicameral]] legislature comprises a 100-member [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] and a 342-member [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. The [[President of Pakistan|President]] is the [[Head of State]] and the [[Commander in Chief]] of the Armed Forces and is elected by an [[Electoral College of Pakistan|electoral college]]. The [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|prime minister]] is usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly. Each province has a similar system of government with a directly elected Provincial Assembly in which the leader of the largest party or alliance becomes Chief Minister. Provincial Governors are appointed by the President.

The [[Military of Pakistan|Pakistani military]] has played an influential role in mainstream [[Politics of Pakistan|politics]] throughout Pakistan's history, with military presidents ruling from 1958&ndash;71, 1977&ndash;88 and from 1999 onwards. The leftist [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], emerged as a major political player during the 1970s. Under the military rule of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], Pakistan began a marked shift from the British-era secular politics and policies, to the adoption of [[Sharia]]t and other laws based on Islam. During the 1980s, the anti-[[feudal]], pro-[[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajir]] [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] (MQM) was started by unorthodox and educated urban dwellers of [[Sindh]] and particularly [[Karachi]]. The 1990s were characterized by coalition politics dominated by the Pakistan Peoples Party and a rejuvenated Muslim League.

In the October 2002 general elections, the [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)]] (PML-Q) won a [[plurality]] of National Assembly seats with the second-largest group being the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP), a sub-party of the PPP. [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] of PML-Q emerged as Prime Minister but resigned on [[26 June]] [[2004]] and was replaced by PML-Q leader [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]] as interim Prime Minister. On [[28 August]], [[2004]] the National Assembly voted 191 to 151 to elect the [[Finance Minister of Pakistan|Finance Minister]] and former [[Citibank]] Vice President [[Shaukat Aziz]] as Prime Minister. The [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]], a coalition of Islamic religious parties, won elections in [[North-West Frontier Province]], and increased their representation in the National Assembly - until their defeat in the 2008 elections.

Pakistan is an active member of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC), the latter of which Pakistan has used as a forum for ''Enlightened Moderation'', a plan to promote a [[renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] in the Muslim world. Pakistan is also a member of the major regional organisations of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) and the [[Economic Cooperation Organisation]] (ECO). In the past, Pakistan has had mixed relations with the United States; in the early 1950s, Pakistan was the United States' "most allied ally in Asia"<ref name="mostallied">[http://www.fpa.org/newsletter_info2583/newsletter_info_sub_list.htm?section=Pakistan%3A%20The%20Most%20Allied%20Ally%20in%20Asia Pakistan: The Most Allied Ally in Asia]</ref> and a member of both the [[Central Treaty Organisation]] (CENTO) and the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation]] (SEATO). Also, during the [[Soviet-Afghan War]] in the 1980s Pakistan was a crucial US ally. But relations soured in the 1990s, when sanctions were applied by the US over suspicions of Pakistan's nuclear activities. However, the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent [[War on Terrorism]] have seen an improvement in US&ndash;Pakistan ties, especially after Pakistan ended its support of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Kabul]]. This was evidenced by a drastic increase in American military aid, which saw Pakistan take in $4&nbsp;billion more in three years after the 9/11 attacks than in the three years before.<ref name="blankcheck">{{cite news| coauthors=Nathaniel Heller, Sarah Fort, Marina Walker Guevara, Ben Welsh| title=Pakistan's $4.2 Billion 'Blank Check' for U.S. Military Aid, After 9/11, funding to country soars with little oversight| url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/icij/default.aspx| publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]]| date=2007-03-27}}</ref>

The [[Military of Pakistan|armed forces]] of Pakistan are a completely volunteer force and are the [[List of countries by number of active troops|seventh largest]] in the world. The three main components are the [[Pakistan Army|Army]], [[Pakistan Navy|Navy]] and [[Pakistan Air Force|Air Force]], supported by a number of [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|paramilitary forces]] which carry out internal security roles and border patrols. The [[Pakistan National Command Authority|National Command Authority]] is responsible for exercising employment and development control of all strategic nuclear forces and organizations.

The Pakistan military first saw combat in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|First Kashmir War]], gaining control of what is now [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]]. In 1961, the army repelled a major [[Military history of Pakistan#Pakistan-Afghanistan border clash of 1961|Afghan incursion]] on Pakistan's western border.<Ref>{{cite book

In 1973, the military quelled a [[Military history of Pakistan#Baloch Nationalist uprisings (1973-1978)|Baloch nationalist uprising]]. During the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet-Afghan war]], Pakistan shot down several intruding aircraft, as well as provided covert support to the [[Afghan mujahideen]] through the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] agency. In 1999, Pakistan was involved in the [[Kargil War|Kargil conflict]] with India. Currently, the military is engaged in an [[War in Pakistan (2004–present)|armed conflict]] with orthodox 'Islamic militants' in the north-west of the country.

The Pakistani armed forces are the largest contributors to [[Military of Pakistan - United Nations Peacekeeping missions|United Nations]] peacekeeping efforts, with more than 10,000 personnel deployed in 2007.<ref name="unpko-summary">{{cite web | title=Monthly Summary of Contributors to UN Peacekeeping Operations| url=http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/contributors/2007/march07_2.pdf| publisher=United Nations| format=PDF| accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> Pakistan provided a military contingent to the Coalition during the first [[Gulf War]] and in the past Pakistani personnel volunteered to serve in the armed forces of Arab countries involved in conflicts with [[Israel]].<ref>[http://www.defence.pk/pakistan-army.html] Pakistan Army</ref>

==Geography and climate==
{{main|Geography of Pakistan}}
[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|[[K2]], at 8,611 metres (28,251&nbsp;ft), is the second highest peak in the world.]]
Pakistan covers {{convert|340403|sqmi|km2|0}},<ref name="area_from_factbook"> [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pk.html The area of Pakistan proper excludes the regions administered in Kashmir] URL accessed on [[November 03]], [[2006]]</ref> approximately the combined land areas of [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], with its eastern regions located on the [[Indian plate|Indian tectonic plate]] and the western and northern regions on the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Eurasian landplate]]. Apart from the 1,046&nbsp;kilometre<!--Format per WP:MOSNUM --> (650&nbsp;mi) [[Arabian Sea]] coastline, Pakistan's land borders total 6,774&nbsp;kilometres&mdash;2,430&nbsp;kilometres (1,509&nbsp;mi) with Afghanistan to the northwest, 523&nbsp;kilometres (325&nbsp;mi) with China to the northeast, 2,912&nbsp;kilometres (1,809&nbsp;mi) with India to the east and 909&nbsp;kilometres (565&nbsp;mi) with Iran to the southwest.<ref name="ciafactbook">{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pk.html| title=Pakistan| publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]| work=[[World Factbook]]| accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref>

The different types of natural features range from the sandy beaches, [[lagoon]]s, and [[mangrove]] swamps of the southern coast to preserved beautiful moist temperate forests and the icy peaks of the [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]] and [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in the north. There are an estimated 108 peaks above 7,000&nbsp;metres (23,000&nbsp;ft) high that are covered in snow and [[glaciers]]. Five of the mountains in Pakistan (including [[Nanga Parbat]]) are over 8,000&nbsp;metres (26,000&nbsp;ft). [[India]]n-controlled Kashmir to the [[Northern Areas (Pakistan)|Northern Areas of Pakistan]] and running the length of the country is the [[Indus River]] with its many tributaries. The northern parts of Pakistan attract a large number of foreign tourists. To the west of the Indus are the dry, hilly deserts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]; to the east are the rolling sand dunes of the [[Thar Desert]]. The [[Tharparkar]] desert in the southern province of Sindh, is the only fertile desert in the world. Most areas of Punjab and parts of Sindh are fertile plains where agriculture is of great importance.

The climate varies as much as the scenery, with cold winters and hot summers in the north and a mild climate in the south, moderated by the influence of the ocean. The central parts have extremely hot summers with temperatures rising to 45&nbsp;°C (113&nbsp;°F), followed by very cold winters, often falling below freezing. Officially the highest temperature recorded in Pakistan is {{convert|50.55|C|F|lk=on}} at Pad Idan.<ref name="temperatures">{{cite web |url=http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/scienceques2001/20020524.htm |title=Science Question of the Week |accessdate=2007-12-31 |author=Goddard Space Flight Center |authorlink=Goddard Space Flight Center |date=2002-05-24 |publisher=NASA}}</ref> There is very little rainfall ranging from less than 250 millimetres to more than 1,250 millimetres (9.8&ndash;49.2 in), mostly brought by the unreliable south-westerly [[monsoon]] winds during the late summer. The construction of dams on the rivers and the drilling of water wells in many drier areas have temporarily eased water shortages at the expense of down-gradient populations.

==Flora and fauna==
{{main|Flora of Pakistan|Fauna of Pakistan}}
[[Image:Schraubenziege - Markhor.jpg|thumb|The [[Markhor]] is the national animal of Pakistan]]
The wide variety of landscapes and climates in Pakistan allows for a wide variety of wild animals and birds. The forests range from [[coniferous]] [[Alpine climate|alpine]] and [[subalpine]] trees such as spruce, pine, and [[deodar cedar]] in the northern mountains to [[deciduous]] trees such as the mulberry-type Shisham in the [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sulaiman range]] in the south. The western hills have [[juniper]] and [[tamarisk]] as well as coarse grasses and scrub plants. Along the coast are [[mangrove]] forests which form much of the coastal wetlands.

In the south, there are crocodiles in the murky waters at the mouth of the Indus River whilst on the banks of the river, there are boars, deer, [[porcupine]]s, and small rodents. In the sandy scrublands of central Pakistan are found jackals, hyenas, wild cats, panthers, and leopards while the clear blue skies abound with hawks, falcons, and eagles. In the southwestern deserts are rare Asiatic cheetahs. In the northern mountains are a variety of endangered animals including [[Marco Polo sheep]], [[Urial|Urial sheep]], [[Markhor]] and [[Ibex]] goats, [[Asiatic black bear|black]] and [[Brown bear|brown]] Himalayan bears, and the rare [[Snow Leopard]]. During August 2006, Pakistan donated an orphaned snow leopard cub called Leo to USA.<ref name="Pakistan donates snow leopard to USA">{{cite news

==Society and culture==
{{main|Culture of Pakistan}}

Pakistan has a rich and unique culture that has preserved established traditions throughout history. Many cultural practices, foods, monuments, and shrines were inherited from the rule of Muslim [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] and [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] emperors. The national dress of [[shalwar qamiz]] is originally of [[Central Asian]] origin derived from [[Turko-Iranian]] nomadic invaders and is today worn in all parts of Pakistan. Women wear brightly coloured shalwar qamiz, while men often wear solid-coloured ones. In cities western dress is also popular among the youth and the business sector.

[[Image:0407 207.jpg|thumb|right| A sitar workshop in [[Islamabad]]]]
Pakistani society is largely [[multilingual]] and 96% [[Muslim]], with high regard for traditional family values, although urban families have grown into a [[nuclear family]] system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[joint family]] system. Recent decades have seen the emergence of a middle class in cities like [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Faisalabad]], and [[Peshawar]] that wish to move in a more liberal direction,<ref name="secular_middle">Beinart, Peter.

The variety of [[Music of Pakistan|Pakistani music]] ranges from diverse provincial [[folk music]] and traditional styles such as [[Qawwali]] and [[Ghazal|Ghazal Gayaki]] to modern forms fusing traditional and western music, such as the synchronisation of Qawwali and western music by the world renowned [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]]. In addition Pakistan is home to many famous folk singers such as the late [[Alam Lohar]], who is also well known in [[Punjab (India)|Indian Punjab]]. The arrival of [[Afghan refugees]] in the western provinces has rekindled [[Pashto]] and [[Persians|Persian]] music and established [[Peshawar]] as a hub for Afghan musicians and a distribution centre for Afghan music abroad.<ref>Tohid, Owais [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0607/p07s01-wosc.html Music soothes extremism along troubled Afghan border].

But recently Pakistan allowed selected Bollywood films to be shown in Pakistani cinemas.

There are many festivals celebrated annually in Pakistan - which may or may not be observed as national public [[Holidays in Pakistan|holidays]] - e.g. Pakistan Day ([[23 March]]), Independence Day ([[14 August]]), Defence of Pakistan Day ([[6 September]]), Pakistan Air Force Day ([[7 September]]), the anniversaries of the birth ([[25 December]], a national holiday) and death ([[11 September]]) of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Quaid-e-Azam]], birth of [[Allama Iqbal]] ([[9 November]]) and the birth ([[30 July]]) and death ([[8 July]]) of [[Fatima Jinnah|Madar-e-Millat]]. [[Labour Day]], (also known as [[May Day]]), is also observed in Pakistan on [[May 1]] and is a public holiday. Several important religious festivals are celebrated by Pakistani Muslims during the year; the celeberation days depend on the lunar [[Islamic calendar]]. [[Ramadan]], the ninth month of the calendar, is characterised by daytime fasting for 29 or 30&nbsp;days and is followed by the festival of [[Eid ul-Fitr]]. In a second festival, [[Eid ul-Adha]], an animal is sacrificed in remembrance of the actions of Prophet [[Abraham]] (Arabic: Ibrahim) and the meat is shared with friends, family, and the less fortunate. Both Eid festivals are public holidays, serving as opportunities for people to visit family and friends, and for children to receive new clothes, presents, and sweets. Muslims also celebrate [[Milad al-Nabi|Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi]] - the birthday of the prophet [[Muhammad]] - in the third month of the calendar ([[Rabi' al-Awwal]]) and mark the [[Day of Ashurah]] on the 9th and 10th days of the first month ([[Muharram]]) to commemorate the martyrdom of [[Husayn bin Ali]]. Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians in Pakistan also celebrate their own festivals and holidays. [[Sikhs]] come from across the world to visit several holy sites in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], including the shrine of [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of [[Sikhism]], at Hasan Abdal in [[Attock District]], and his birthplace, at [[Nankana Sahib]]. There are also several regional and local festivals, such as the [[Punjab region|Punjabi]] festival of [[Basant]], which marks the start of spring and is celebrated by kite flying.

[[Image:Tooba mosque.jpg|left|thumb|An example of modern day Pakistani architecture in [[Karachi]].]]
The [[Pakistani architecture|architecture]] of the areas now constituting Pakistan can be designated to four distinct periods — [[History of Pakistan#Prehistory|pre-Islamic]], [[History of Pakistan#The Muslim period|Islamic]], [[History of Pakistan#Colonial era|colonial]] and [[History of Pakistan#Independence|post-colonial]]. With the beginning of the [[Indus civilization]] around the middle of the [[3rd millennium]]<ref>Dehejia, Vidja [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sasa/hd_sasa.htm South Asian Art and Culture]. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved on [[February 10]], [[2008]]</ref> B.C., an advanced [[urban culture]] developed for the first time in the region, with large structural facilities, some of which survive to this day.<ref>The Indus Valley And The Genesis Of South Asian Civilization [http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm] Retrieved on [[February 6]], [[2008]]</ref>[[Mohenjo Daro]], [[Harappa]] and [[Kot Diji]] belong to the pre-Islamic era settlements. The rise of [[Buddhism]] and the [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] influence led to the development of the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] style, starting from the 1st century CE. The high point of this era was reached with the culmination of the [[Gandhara]] style. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery [[Takht Bhai|Takht-i-Bahi]] in the [[North-West Frontier Province|northwest province]]. The arrival of [[Islam]] in today's Pakistan meant a sudden end of Buddhist architecture.<ref>[http://pakistaniat.com/2006/10/10/pakistan-architecture-history/comment-page-2/ Architecture in Pakistan: A Historical Overview]. <u>All Things Pakistan</u>. Retrieved on [[February 10]], [[2008]]</ref> However, a smooth transition to predominantly pictureless [[Islamic architecture]] occurred. The most important of the few completely discovered buildings of Persian style is the [[Rukn-e-Alam|tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam]] in [[Multan]]. During the [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] era design elements of Islamic-Persian architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of the Hindustani art. [[Lahore]], occasional residence of Mughal rulers, exhibits a multiplicity of important buildings from the empire, among them the [[Badshahi mosque]], the [[Lahore Fort|fortress of Lahore]] with the famous [[Alamgiri Gate]], the colourful, still strongly Persian seeming [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] as well as numerous other mosques and mausoleums. Also the [[Shahjahan Mosque]] of [[Thatta]] in Sindh originates from the epoch of the Mughals. In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures like the [[Faisal Mosque]], the [[Minar-e-Pakistan]] and the [[Mazar-e-Quaid]].
