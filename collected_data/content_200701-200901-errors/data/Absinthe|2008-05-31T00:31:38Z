'''Absinthe'''  is a [[distillation|distilled]], highly [[alcohol]]ic (45%-90% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]]), [[anise]]-[[Flavored liquor|flavored spirit]] derived from [[herb]]s, including the flowers and leaves of the herb ''[[Absinth Wormwood|Artemisia absinthium]]'', also called "[[wormwood]]." Absinthe is typically of a natural green color but is also produced in both clear and artificially colored styles.  It is often called "the Green Fairy."

Although it is sometimes mistakenly called a [[liqueur]], absinthe is not bottled with added [[sugar]] and is therefore classified as a [[Distilled beverage|liquor]].<ref>'Traite de la Fabrication de Liqueurs et de la Distillation des Alcools' Duplais (1882 3rd Ed, Pg 249)</ref> Absinthe is unusual among spirits in that it is bottled at a high [[Proof (alcohol)|proof]] but is normally diluted with water when it is drunk. 

Absinthe originated in [[Switzerland]]. However, it is better known for its popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century [[France]], particularly among [[Paris]]ian artists and writers. Due in part to its association with [[bohemianism|bohemian]] culture, absinthe was opposed by [[social conservatives]] and [[prohibitionists]]. [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[Aleister Crowley]] were all notorious "bad men" of that day who were (or were thought to be) devotees of the Green Fairy.

Absinthe was portrayed as a dangerously [[Addiction|addictive]], [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychoactive]] drug. The chemical [[thujone]], present in small quantities, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915 absinthe had been banned in the United States and in most European countries except the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Although absinthe was vilified,<ref name = "sap_absinthism">[http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/1/1/14 Absinthism: a fictitious 19th century syndrome with present impact] Retrieved 20 November 2006</ref> no evidence has shown it to be any more dangerous than ordinary liquor. Its psychoactive properties, apart from those of [[ethanol]], have been much exaggerated.

A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, when countries in the [[European Union]] began to reauthorize its manufacture and sale. [[As of February 2008]], nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably France, Switzerland, [[Spain]], and the [[Czech Republic]].<ref>[http://www.feeverte.net/guide/archives.html The Absinthe Buyer’s Guide: Modern & Vintage Absinthe Reference: Archives<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Etymology, spelling, pronunciation==
{{wiktionarypar|absinthe}}
The French word ''absinthe'' can refer either to the alcoholic beverage or, less commonly, to the actual wormwood plant (''grande absinthe'' being ''[[Absinth Wormwood|Artemisia absinthium]]'', and ''petite absinthe'' being ''[[Artemisia pontica]]''). The [[Latin]] name ''artemisia'' comes from [[Artemis]], the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek]] goddess of forests and hills.  ''Absinthe'' is derived from the Latin ''absinthium'', which in turn is a stylization of the [[Greek language|Greek]] '''αψίνθιον''' (apsínthion), for wormwood. 

Some claim that the word means "undrinkable" in Greek, but it may instead be linked to the [[Persian language|Persian]] root ''spand'' or ''aspand'', or the variant ''esfand'', which meant ''[[Harmal|Peganum harmala]]'', also called Syrian Rue though it is not an actual variety of [[rue]], another famously bitter herb.

That ''Artemisia absinthium'' was commonly burned as a protective offering may suggest that its origins lie in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*spend'', meaning "to perform a ritual" or "make an offering." Whether the word was a borrowing from Persian into Greek, or from a common ancestor of both, is unclear.<ref>[http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/engl/Arte_vul.html#absinthe Absinthe etymology] Retrieved 30 March 2006</ref>

Variant spellings of absinthe are ''absinth'', ''absynthe'', and ''absenta''.  For its English pronunciation, see {{IPAEng|ˈæbˌsinθ}}; for the French, see {{IPA2|apˈsɛ̃ːt}}.

''Absinth'' (without the final ''e'') is a spelling variant that is used by central European distillers.  It is the usual
name for absinthe produced in the Czech Republic and in Germany, and has become associated with [[Bohemian style absinth|Bohemian style absinthes]].<ref>[http://www.feeverte.net/faq-absinthe.html#B16 Absinth] Short explanation of the adoption of the ''absinth'' spelling by Bohemian producers. Retrieved 22 Jan 2008.</ref>

==The "ritual" (preparation)==
{{main|Absinthiana}}
[[Image:Preparing absinthe.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Preparing absinthe the traditional way. Note, no burning.]]

Traditionally, absinthe is poured into a glass over which a specially designed [[slotted spoon]] is placed.  A sugar cube is then deposited in the bowl of the spoon.  Ice-cold water is poured or dripped over the sugar until the drink is diluted to a ratio between 3:1 and 5:1. During this process, the components that are not soluble in water, mainly those from [[anise]], [[fennel]], and [[star anise]], come out of solution and [[Ouzo effect|cloud the drink]]. The resulting milky [[opalescence]] is called the ''louche'' (Fr. "opaque" or "shady", IPA [luʃ]). The addition of water is important, causing the herbs to "blossom" and bringing out many of the flavors originally overpowered by the anise.  

Originally a waiter would serve a dose of absinthe, ice water in a [[carafe]], and sugar separately, and the drinker would prepare it to their preference<ref>[http://www.oxygenee.com/absinthe-faq/faq3.html Professors of Absinthe] Historic account of preparation at a bar. Retrieved 22 Jan 2008</ref>. With increased popularity, the absinthe fountain, a large jar of ice water on a base with [[spigot]]s, came into use. It allowed a number of drinks to be prepared at once, and with a hands-free drip, patrons were able to socialize while louching a glass.

Although many bars served absinthe in standard glasses, a number of glasses were specifically made for absinthe. These had a dose line, bulge, or bubble in the lower portion denoting how much absinthe should be poured in. One "dose" of absinthe is around 1 ounce (30 ml), and most glasses used this as the standard, with some drinkers using as much as 1 1/2 ounces (45 ml).

In addition to being drunk with water poured over sugar, absinthe was a common cocktail ingredient in both the United Kingdom and the United States,<ref>[http://realabsinthe.blogspot.com/2007/05/long-list-of-absinthe-cocktails_30.html List of 104 cocktails including absinthe from the 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book]. The Real Absinthe Blog. Retrieved 11 June 2007.</ref> and continues to be a popular ingredient today. One of the most famous of these is Ernest Hemingway’s "Death in the Afternoon" cocktail, a concoction he contributed to a 1935 collection of celebrity recipes. His directions are as follows: "Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness.  Drink three to five of these slowly."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/dining/03curi.html?ex=1325480400&en=3fb2c549f0334e97&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss Trying to clear Absinthe’s reputation] - [[New York Times]]</ref>

==Production==
 [[Image:Koehler1887-PimpinellaAnisum.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Anise, one of the three main herbs used in production of absinthe]]
[[Image:Koeh-164.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Grande Wormwood, one of the three main herbs used in production of absinthe]]
[[Image:Koeh-148.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Fennel, one of the three main herbs used in production of absinthe]]

The three main herbs used to produce absinthe are [[Absinth Wormwood|grande wormwood]], green anise, and florence fennel, which are often called "the holy trinity."<ref>{{cite news|last=Chu| first=Louisa|date=  March 12, 2008|title=Crazy for absinthe|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribunes]]'' online |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/food/chi-drink_absinthe_12mar12,0,3796843.story}}</ref> Many other herbs may be used as well, such as petite wormwood (''Artemisia pontica'' or Roman wormwood), [[hyssop]], [[Lemon balm|melissa]], star anise, [[angelica]] root, [[Sweet Flag]], [[dittany]] leaves, [[coriander]], [[veronica (plant)|veronica]], [[juniper]], [[nutmeg]], and various mountain herbs.

The simple [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] of wormwood in alcohol (as called for in absinthe kits) without distillation produces an extremely bitter drink because of the presence of the water-soluble [[absinthin]], one of the most bitter substances known to man. Authentic recipes call for [[distillation]] after a primary maceration and before the optional secondary coloring maceration. The distillation of absinthe first produces a colorless distillate that leaves the [[alembic]] at around 72 percent [[ethanol|alcohol]] by volume (144 proof). 

The distillate can be bottled clear, to produce a ''Blanche'' or ''la Bleue'' absinthe, or it can be colored using artificial or natural coloring. Traditional absinthes take their green color from [[chlorophyll]], which is present in some of the herbal ingredients during the secondary  [[maceration]]. This is done by [[steeping]] petite wormwood, hyssop, and [[melissa (plant)|melissa]] (among other herbs) in the liquid. [[Chlorophyll]] from these herbs is extracted giving the drink its famous green color. This process also provides the herbal complexity that is typical of high quality absinthe. This type of absinthe is known as a ''verte''.  After the coloring process, the resulting product is reduced with water to the desired percentage of alcohol.  Historically, most absinthes contain between 60 and 75 percent alcohol by volume (120 to 150 proof). It is said to improve materially with storage, and many pre-ban distilleries aged their absinthe in neutral barrels before bottling. 

Modern absinthe is often produced by mixing steam-distilled oils in high-proof alcohol, and is called an oil-mix.

NOTE:  Absinthe can also be naturally colored red using hibiscus flowers. This is called a ''rouge'' or ''rose'' absinthe. As of now, only one historical rouge brand has been discovered<ref>[http://www.oxygenee.com/absinthe/posters1.html Original Vintage Absinthe Posters at The Virtual Absinthe Museum: Tamagno, Privat-Livemont<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

===Absinthe kits===

[''Note'': Absinthe kits should not be confused with [[Absinthe#Hausgemacht absinthe|hausgemacht absinthe]].]

Numerous recipes for homemade “absinthe” are available on the Internet.  Many of these center around mixing a kit that contains store-bought herbs or wormwood extract with high-proof liquor such as [[vodka]] or [[Everclear (alcohol)|Everclear]]. However, it is simply not possible to make proper absinthe without distillation. 

Besides being unpleasant to drink<ref>[http://wormwoodsociety.org/ABSfaq.html#swill About absinthe kits]</ref> and not authentic absinthe, these homemade concoctions contain uncontrolled amounts of thujone and may be poisonous—especially if they contain wormwood extract.<ref>[http://www.gumbopages.com/nejm.html Evolution in Action!] Gumbo Pages.  Dangers of drinking wormwood extract.  Retrieved 26 August 2007</ref> Many such recipes call for the use of a large amount of wormwood extract (essence of wormwood) with the intent of increasing alleged [[Hallucinogen|psychoactive]] effects. Consuming essence of wormwood is very dangerous. It can cause [[renal failure|kidney failure]] and death from excessive thujone, which in large quantities is a [[Seizure|convulsive]] [[neurotoxin]]. Thujone is also a powerful heart stimulant; it is present in authentic absinthe only in extremely small amounts.

'''Essence of wormwood should never be drunk.'''

Most alcoholic beverages have regulations governing their classification and labeling. Modern absinthe is not governed in this way and classification is difficult and, by nature, inaccurate. Historically, there were five grades of absinthe: ''ordinaire'', ''demi-fine'', ''fine'', ''supérieure'' and ''Suisse'' (which does not denote origin), in order of increasing alcoholic strength and quality. A supérieure and Suisse would always be naturally colored and distilled. Ordinaire and demi-fine could be artificially colored and made from oil extracts. These terms are no longer used as an industry standard, but some brands today still use the ''Suisse'' designation on their labels. Many contemporary absinthe critics use two classifications to denote quality: ''distilled'' and ''mixed''. Within these two process-based classifications there are substantial variations in quality due to variations in the raw materials used, and they should not be viewed as complete measures of quality.

===Blanche/la Bleue=== 
Blanche absinthe (also referred to as ''la Bleue'' in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and is unaltered. It is a clear liquid which contains the distilled oils of the herbs used in its production. The name ''la Bleue'' was originally a term used for bootleg Swiss absinthe, but has become a popular term for Swiss absinthe in general.

===Verte===
Verte ("green" in French) absinthe begins as a blanche. The distillate is altered by the 'coloring step' whereby a new mixture of herbs remains in contact with the clear distillate. This process greatly alters the color and flavor, imparting an emerald green hue and a heavier, more intense flavor. This type of absinthe was most commonly consumed in the 19th century and is what is generally thought of as absinthe. {{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Artificially colored green absinthe is also called "verte" although it lacks the herbal characteristic from the natural coloring step.

===Absenta===
Absenta ("absinthe" in Spanish) is a regional variation and typically differs slightly from its French cousin. Absentas typically are sweeter in flavor due to their use of [[Alicante anise]]<ref>[http://www.absinthebuyersguide.com/Articles/finespirits_peterverte.html Fine Spirits Corner - by Peter Verte<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and contain a characteristic citrus flavor<ref>[http://www.feeverte.net/guide/country/spain/ The Absinthe Buyer's Guide: Modern & Vintage Absinthe Reference: Spain Archives<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. 

===Bohemian style absinth===
{{main|Bohemian style absinth}}

'''Bohemian style absinth''' (also called Czech-style absinthe, anise-free absinthe, or just "absinth" (without the ''e''))  is best described as a wormwood bitters. It is produced mainly in the Czech Republic,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/04/26/worthy-of-their-name.php | title = Worthy of their name | publisher = [[The Prague Post]] | date = [[2006-04-26]] | accessdate = 2007-05-20}}</ref> from which it gets its designations as "Bohemian" or "Czech," although not all absinthe from the Czech Republic is Bohemian style. It contains little or none of the anise, fennel, and other herbs that are found in traditional absinthe.

Typical Bohemian style absinth has two similarities with its traditional counterpart, in that it contains wormwood and has a high alcohol content.

==Storage==
Absinthe that is artificially colored or clear is relatively stable and can be bottled in a clear container. If naturally colored absinthe is exposed to light, the chlorophyll breaks down, changing the color from emerald green to yellow green to brown. Pre-ban and vintage absinthes are often of a distinct amber color as a result of this process. Though this color is considered a mark of maturity in vintage absinthes, it is regarded as undesirable in contemporary absinthe. Due to this fragility, naturally colored absinthe is typically bottled in dark UV resistant wine bottles. 

Absinthe should be stored in a cool, [[room temperature]], dry place away from light and heat.  They should also be kept out of the refrigerator and freezer as anethole can crystallize inside the bottle, creating a 'scum' in the bottle which may or may not dissolve back into solution as the bottle warms.  Properly stored absinthes not only maintain their quality, but many improve in aroma, flavor, and complexity with aging.

==History==
[[Image:Absinthepster.jpg|left|thumb|[[Privat-Livemont]]’s 1896 poster]]
===Origin===
The precise origin of absinthe is unclear. The medical use of wormwood dates back to [[ancient Egypt]] and is mentioned in the [[Ebers Papyrus]], circa 1550 BC. Wormwood extracts and wine-soaked wormwood leaves were used as remedies by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]]. Moreover, there is evidence of the existence of a wormwood-flavored wine, ''absinthites oinos'', in ancient Greece.<ref>[http://www.perseus.org/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2318892 ''Apsinthitês oinos'': Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon]</ref> 

The first clear evidence of absinthe in the modern sense of a distilled spirit containing green anise and fennel, however, dates to the 18th century.  According to legend, absinthe began as an all-purpose patent [[remedy]] created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in [[Couvet]], Switzerland, around 1792 (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire’s recipe was passed on to the Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold absinthe as a medicinal [[Tincture|elixir]]. By other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have been making the elixir before Ordinaire’s arrival. In either case, a certain Major Dubied acquired the formula from the sisters and in 1797, with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod, opened the first absinthe distillery, Dubied Père et Fils, in Couvet. In 1805 they built a second distillery in [[Pontarlier|Pontarlier, France]], under the new company name Maison Pernod Fils.<ref>Absinthe FAQ III</ref> Pernod Fils remained one of the most popular brand of absinthe up until the ban of the drink in France in 1915.

Today, some brands of absinthe are: Lucid, Aphrodisia and St George.

===Rapid growth in French consumption===
[[Image:Pernodad.jpg|right|thumb|A vintage [[Pernod Fils]] absinthe advertisement]]
Absinthe’s popularity grew steadily through the 1840s, when absinthe was given to French troops as a [[malaria]] treatment [http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-04-07/news/behind-the-green-door/print]. When the troops returned home, they brought their taste for absinthe with them, and it became popular at [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] and [[bistro]]s.

By the 1860s absinthe had become so popular that in most [[Cafe|cafés]] and [[cabaret]]s, 5 p.m. signaled ''l’heure verte'' ("the green hour"). It was favored by all [[social class]]es, from the wealthy [[bourgeoisie]] to poor [[bohemian culture|Bohemian]] artists. By the 1880s, the onset of mass production caused the price of absinthe to drop significantly, the market expanded, and this, combined with the [[Phylloxera|wine shortage in France]] during the 1880s and 1890s, caused absinthe to soon become the drink of choice in France. By 1910 the French were consuming 36 million [[liter|litres]] of absinthe per year, more than they drank [[wine]].<ref name="abfaq3">Oxygénée’s History & FAQ III.  "In 1874, France consumed 700,000 litres of absinthe, but by 1910 the figure had exploded to 36,000,000 litres…." http://www.oxygenee.com/absinthe-faq/faq3.html. </ref>

===International Consumption===
Outside of France, absinthe has been consumed in several other places including most notably [[Catalonia]] in [[Spain]], as well as [[New Orleans]] and the [[Czech Republic]].

Absinthe was never banned in Spain, and its production and consumption has never ceased. During the early 20th century it gained a temporary spike in popularity corresponding with the French influenced Art Nouveau and Modernism aesthetic movements.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.absinthebuyersguide.com/Articles/finespirits_peterverte.html | title = The Fine Spirits Corner | first = Peter | last = Verte | work = Absinthe Buyers Guide | accessdate = 2008-04-11 }}</ref>.  

New Orleans also has a historical connection to absinthe consumption.  It boasts a prominent land mark called [[The Old Absinthe house]], located on Bourbon Street.  Originally called The Absinthe Room, it was opened in 1874 by a [[Catalan]] bar tender named [[Cayetano Ferrer]] who brought his taste for the European beverage with him to America.  The building was frequented by many famous people including [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and notoriously [[Aleister Crowley]]<ref>[http://www.oxygenee.com/absinthe-america/neworleans.html The Virtual Absinthe Museum: Absinthe in America - New Orleans<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.experienceneworleans.com/ruebourbon/history.html Rue Bourbon ~ Home to four great New Orleans establishments<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. 
  
Absinthe has been consumed in the Czech Republic (then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]) since at least 1888, notably by Czech artists, some of whom had an affinity for Paris, frequenting Prague’s famous Cafe Slavia.<ref>[http://www.reflex.cz/Clanek13219.html Cafe Slavia]</ref> Its wider appeal in [[Bohemia]] itself is uncertain, though it was sold in and around [[Prague]]. There is evidence that at least one local liquor distillery in Bohemia was making absinthe at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.olivaabsinth.com/history-of-absinthe-buy-absinthe-pg-11.html 'Oliva Absinth’s History of Absinthe page'] Retrieved 16 March 2007</ref>

===Ban===
Spurred by the [[temperance movement]] and wine makers' associations, absinthe was publicly associated with violent crimes and social disorder.

[[Image:Absinthefairy.jpg|thumb|Albert Maignan’s "Green Muse" (1895): A poet succumbs to the green fairy.]] 
A critic said that:

{{cquote|Absinthe makes you crazy and criminal, provokes epilepsy and tuberculosis, and has killed thousands of French people. It makes a ferocious beast of man, a martyr of woman, and a degenerate of the infant, it disorganizes and ruins the family and menaces the future of the country.<ref>Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). ''Absinthe History in a Bottle''. Chronicle books. ISBN 0-8118-1650-8 Pg. 116</ref>}}

[[Edgar Degas|Edgar Degas’]] 1876 painting ''[[L'Absinthe|L’Absinthe]]'' ("''Absinthe''") (now at the [[Musée d'Orsay|Musée d’Orsay]]) epitomized the popular view of absinthe 'addicts' as sodden and benumbed. Although he mentioned it only once by name, [[Émile Zola]] described their serious intoxication in his novel ''[[L'Assommoir|L’Assommoir]]'':  

{{cquote|Boche had known a joiner who had stripped himself stark naked in the rue Saint-Martin and died doing the polka—he was an absinthe-drinker.<ref>page 411 of the 1970 Penguin Classics English edition</ref>}}

In 1905 it was reported that [[Jean Lanfray]] murdered his family and attempted to kill himself after drinking absinthe. The fact that he was an alcoholic who had drunk considerably after the two glasses of absinthe in the morning was overlooked, and the murders were blamed solely on absinthe.<ref>Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). ''Absinthe History in a Bottle''. Chronicle books. ISBN 0-8118-1650-8 Pg. 1–4</ref> The Lanfray murders were the last straw, and a petition to ban absinthe in Switzerland was signed by over 82,000 people.

In 1906 [[Belgium]] and [[Brazil]] banned the sale and redistribution of absinthe, although they were not the first. Absinthe was banned as early as 1898 in the colony of the [[Congo Free State]].<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/27/wbdrink_ed3_.php Fans of absinthe party like it’s 1899] [[International Herald Tribune]]. Retrieved 19 January 2007</ref> In Switzerland, the prohibition of absinthe was even written into the [[Swiss Federal Constitution|constitution]] in 1907, following a [[popular initiative]]. [[The Netherlands]] banned absinthe in 1909, followed by the United States in 1912 and France in 1915. 

The prohibition of absinthe in France led to the growing popularity of ''[[pastis]]'' and ''[[ouzo]]'', anise-flavored liqueurs that do not use wormwood. The Pernod distillery moved their absinthe production to [[Catalonia]], Spain,<ref>[http://www.avenuevine.com/archives/2007_07.html Bacardi Invests More Than $250 Million in Dewar’s Scotch Whiskey] - Avenue Vine</ref> where absinthe was still legal<ref>[http://www.feeverte.net/guide/historic-absinthe-brands/pernod_fils_tarragona_circa_19/ The Absinthe Buyer’s Guide] - La Fée Verte</ref> but slow sales in the 1960s eventually caused them to close down - even though a few microdistilleries continued to exist in the area.<ref>[http://www.absinthebuyersguide.com/Articles/finespirits_peterverte.html Absinthe Buyer’s Guide: The Fine Spirits Corner]</ref> 

In Switzerland, the ban drove absinthe underground. Evidence suggests small home clandestine distillers have been producing absinthe after the ban, focusing on [[Les Blanches]] or [[Les Bleues]] as it was easier to disguise a clear product as non-absinthe. 

Many countries never banned absinthe, notably [[United Kingdom|Britain]], where absinthe had not been as popular as in [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]].

===Modern revival===
[[Image:Modern-absinthe-bottlescrop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Modern absinthe.  Left Vertes, right blanches, with a prepared glass in front of each.]]
In the 1990s an importer, [[George Rowley (entrepreneur)|BBH Spirits]], realized that there was no [[United Kingdom|UK]] law prohibiting the sale of absinthe, as it had never been banned there and started importing Hill’s Absinth from the [[Czech Republic|Czech Republic]] which helped begin a modern resurgence in absinthe’s popularity. Absinthe had also never been banned in Spain or [[Portugal]], where it continued to be made. These absinthes—Czech, Spanish, and Portuguese brands—date mostly from the 1990s, are generally of [[Bohemian style absinth|Bohemian style]], and are considered by many absinthe connoisseurs to be of inferior quality. <ref>[http://www.feeverte.net/faq.html Absinthe at la Fée Verte: FAQ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

France never repealed its 1915 ban on absinthe, but in 1988 a law was passed stating that only beverages that do not comply with European Union regulations with respect to thujone content, or that call themselves 'absinthe' explicitly, fall under the old ban. This has resulted in the re-emergence of French absinthes, now labeled ''liqueur à base de plantes d’absinthe'' or ''liqueur aux extraits d’absinthe'' ('wormwood-based liqueur' or 'liqueur with wormwood extract'). Many absinthes marketed openly in other countries are re-labeled to meet these legal guidelines for sale in France. Interestingly, as the 1915 law regulates only the sale of absinthe in France but not its production, many manufacturers also produce variants destined for export which are plainly labeled 'absinthe'. [[La Fée Absinthe]], released in 2000, was the first brand of absinthe distilled and bottled in France since the 1915 ban, initially for export from France, but now one of roughly fifty French-produced absinthes available in France.

Absinthe has never been illegal to import or manufacture in Australia. Importation requires a permit under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 due to a restriction on importing any product containing "oil of wormwood".<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_reg/cir1956432/sch8.html Schedule 8] ''[[Commonwealth of Australia]]'' [[Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956]] [[Schedule 8]]. Retrieved [[29 December]] [[2006]]</ref>  In 2000 there was an amendment by Foods Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) as part of a new consolidation of the Food Code across Australia and New Zealand to make all wormwood species prohibited herbs for food purposes under Food Standard 1.4.4.

[[Image:Absinthe spoons.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Collection of absinthe spoons. These specialized spoons are used to hold the sugar cube over which ice-cold water is poured to dilute the absinthe. Note the slot on the handle that allows the spoon to rest securely on the rim of the glass.]]In the [[Netherlands]], this law was successfully challenged by the [[Amsterdam]] wine seller [[Menno Boorsma]] in July 2004, making absinthe legal once again. Belgium, as part of an effort to simplify its laws, removed its absinthe law on [[1 January]] [[2005]], citing (as did the Dutch judge) European food regulations as sufficient to render the law unnecessary (and indeed, in conflict with the spirit of the [[Single European Market]]).

In Switzerland, the constitutional ban on absinthe was repealed in 2000 during an overhaul of the national constitution, although the prohibition was written into ordinary law instead. Later that law was repealed, so from March 1, 2005, absinthe is again legal in its country of origin. Absinthe is now not only sold in Switzerland, but is once again distilled in its [[Val-de-Travers (district)|Val-de-Travers]] birthplace, with [[Kübler Absinthe|Kübler]] and [[La Clandestine Absinthe]] among the first new brands to reemerge.

It is once again legal to produce and sell absinthe in practically every country where alcohol is legal, the major exception being the United States, but as of 2007 absinthe’s "banned status" in the States is changing, and two brands, [[Lucid (Absinthe)|Lucid]] and Kübler, began to be sold openly within the U.S. Laws concerning other absinthes are still unclear because it is not technically illegal to possess or consume other brands of absinthe in the United States. In 2007, St. George Absinthe Verte from St. George Spirits of [[Alameda, California]] became the first brand of American-made absinthe legally produced and sold in the U.S. in nearly a century.<ref>Stacy Finz, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/05/MNQJTO9FM.DTL "Alameda distiller helps make absinthe legitimate again"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', December 5, 2007</ref><ref>Pete Wells, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/dining/05absi.html "A Liquor of Legend Makes a Comeback"], ''New York Times'', December 5, 2007</ref>

===Hausgemacht absinthe===

''Hausgemacht'' (German for ''home-made'', often abbreviated as ''HG'') is a type of absinthe that is home-distilled by hobbyists.  It is often called ''clandestine absinthe''. It should not be confused with the Clandestine brand, nor should it be confused with absinthe kits.

Produced mainly in small quantities for personal use and not for sale, hausgemacht absinthe enables experienced distillers to personally select the herbs and to fine-tune each batch.  Clandestine production increased after absinthe was banned, when small producers went underground, most notably in Switzerland. 

Although the Swiss had produced both vertes and blanches before the ban, clear absinthe (known as La Bleue) became more popular after the ban because it is easier to hide.  Although the ban has been lifted, many clandestine distillers have not made themselves legal. Authorities believe that high taxes on alcohol and the mystique of being underground have given them a reason not to.  <ref>[http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/swissinfo.html?siteSect=107&sid=6586791&cKey=1143621269000 Absinthe bootleggers refuse to go straight]. Swiss info. Retrieved 11 May 2006.</ref> Those hausgemacht distillers who have become legal often place the word ''clandestine'' on their labels.

==Cultural impact==
{{main|Absinthe in popular culture}}
[[Image:Absinthe.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|''[[L’Absinthe]]'', by Edgar Degas.]]
The legacy of absinthe as a mysterious, addictive, and mind-altering drink continues to this day. Absinthe has been seen or featured in fine art, movies, video, music and literature. The modern absinthe revival has had an effect on its portrayal. It is often shown as an unnaturally glowing green liquid which is set on fire before drinking, even though traditionally neither is true.  In addition, it is most commonly known in the media for over-the-top hallucinations.

===Historical===
Numerous artists and writers living in France in the late 19th- and early 20th-century were noted absinthe drinkers who featured absinthe in their work. These included [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Paul Verlaine]]. Later artists and writers drew from this cultural well, including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[Ernest Hemingway]]. [[Aleister Crowley]] was also known to be a habitual absinthe drinker.
[[Emile Cohl]], an early pioneer in the art of animation, presented the effects of the drink in 1919 with the short film, ''hasher's delirium''.

===Modern===
The mystery and illicit quality surrounding the popular view of absinthe has played into modern music, movies, television shows and literature. These depictions vary in their authenticity, often applying [[dramatic license]] to depict the drink as everything from [[aphrodisiac]] to [[poison]].

==Effects of absinthe==
[[Image:Edouard Manet 001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Edouard Manet]], ''The Absinthe Drinker'']]

Absinthe has long been believed to be [[hallucinogenic]]. This belief got a contemporary boost in the 1970s when a scientific paper mistakenly reported thujone was related to [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]], the active chemical in [[marijuana]], which has hallucinogenic properties.<ref name="thc">Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe History in a Bottle. Chronicle books. ISBN 0-8118-1650-8 Pg. 152</ref> Martin Paul Smith incorrectly argued that absinthe had narcotic effects due to the fermentation process in early 2008.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Padosch | first = Stephan A. | coauthors = Dirk W.

Ten years after his 19th century experiments with wormwood oil, the French Dr. Magnan studied 250 cases of alcoholism and claimed that those who drank absinthe were worse off than those drinking ordinary alcohol, and that they experienced rapid-onset hallucinations.<ref>[http://www.thujone.info/thujone-absinthe-13.html The Lancet 1874, ON THE COMPARATIVE ACTION OF ALCOHOL AND ABSINTHE] By Dr. Magnan Retrieved 29 November 2006</ref>

Such accounts by absinthe opponents were embraced by its most famous users, many of whom were [[bohemian culture|bohemian]] artists or writers<ref> Salleh, A. [http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/05/01/2231727.htm Absinthes's Mytique Cops a Blow], ''ABC Science'', May1, 2008.</ref>. In one of the best known accounts of absinthe drinking, [[Oscar Wilde]] described the feeling of having tulips on his legs after leaving a bar.<ref>Baker, Phil; (2001). ''The Book of Absinthe: A Cultural History". Grove Press books. ISBN 0-8021-3993-0 Pg. 32</ref>  Two famous painters who helped popularize the notion that absinthe had powerful psychoactive properties were [[Toulouse Lautrec]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] (who suffered from mental instability throughout his life).

Today it is known that absinthe does not cause hallucinations, especially ones similar to those described in 19th century studies. Thujone, the supposed active chemical in absinthe, is a [[GABA]] antagonist and, while it can produce muscle spasms in large doses, there is no evidence that it causes hallucinations. It has been speculated that reports of hallucinogenic effects of absinthe may have been due to poisonous chemicals being added to cheaper versions of the drink in the 19th century, to give it a more vivid colour.<ref>Ian Hutton, page 63, "Common adulterants were cupric acetate (to provide the valued green colour)"</ref>

However, the debate over whether absinthe produces effects on the human mind additional to those of alcohol has not been conclusively resolved. The effects of absinthe have been described by some artists as mind opening. The most commonly reported experience is a 'clear-headed' feeling of inebriation &mdash; a form of 'lucid drunkenness'. Some modern specialists, such as chemist, historian and absinthe distiller Ted Breaux, claim that alleged secondary effects of absinthe may be caused by the fact that some of the herbal compounds in the drink act as [[stimulants]], while others act as [[sedatives]], creating an overall lucid effect of awakening.<ref>[http://wired-vig.wired.com/wired/archive/13.11/absinthe.html The Mystery of the Green Menace - Wired Magazine (see page 3 of article)]</ref>

Long term effects of low absinthe consumption in humans remain unknown, although it is known that the herbs contained in absinthe have both [[anesthetics|painkilling]] and [[antiparasitic]] properties.
===Controversy===
It was once thought that excessive absinthe drinking had worse effects than those associated with overindulgence in other forms of alcohol, a belief that led to diagnoses of the disease of 'absinthism'.  One of the first vilifications of absinthe was an 1864 experiment in which a certain Dr. Magnan exposed a [[guinea pig]] to large doses of pure wormwood vapor and another to alcohol vapors. The guinea pig exposed to wormwood experienced convulsive seizures, while the animal exposed to alcohol did not. Dr. Magnan would later blame the chemical thujone, contained in wormwood, for these effects.<ref>Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe History in a Bottle. Chronicle books. ISBN 0-8118-1650-8 Pg. 101</ref>

Past reports estimated thujone levels in absinthe as high — up to 260 mg per kg of absinthe.<ref>Ian Hutton, page 62, "quoted by Arnold"..."Arnold WN (1989) Absinthe: Scientific American 260(6):112-117"</ref> More recent studies have shown that very little of the thujone present in wormwood actually makes it into a properly distilled absinthe, even when using historical recipes and methods. Most proper absinthes, both vintage and modern, are within the current EU limits.<ref>Ian Hutton, pages 62-63</ref><ref name="emmert">{{cite journal| quotes = no| author = Joachim Emmert| coauthors = Günter Sartor, Frank Sporer and Joachim Gummersbach| year = 2004| title = Determination of α-/β-Thujone and Related Terpenes in Absinthe using Solid Phase Extraction and Gas Chromatography| journal = Deutsche Lebensmittel-Rundschau| volume = 9| issue = 100| pages = 352-356| publisher = Gabriele Lauser, Ingrid Steiner| location = Germany| url = http://www.emmert-analytik.de/DLR_100_9_S352-356.pdf| language = English| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-11-26| quote = Tab. 1 Concentrations of thujone and anethole in different absinthe samples}}</ref><ref>[http://www.emmert-analytik.de/DLR_100_9_S352-356.pdf Determination of a/β Thujone and Related Terpenes in Absinthe using Solid Phase Extraction and Gas Chromatography].

A study in the ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol''<ref>[http://alcoholstudies.rutgers.edu/journal/september04/abstract.shtml Absinthe: Attention Performance and Mood under the Influence of Thujone] Journal of Studies on Alcohol, DETTLING, A. et al. Retrieved 21 May 2006.</ref> concluded that a high concentration of thujone in alcohol has negative effects on attention performance. It slowed down [[reaction time]], and caused subjects to concentrate their attention in the central field of vision. Medium doses did not produce an effect noticeably different from plain [[alcohol]]. The high dose of thujone used in the study was larger than what can currently be obtained, even in 'high thujone' absinthe that cannot be sold legally in the European Union. While the effects of this high dose were [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] in a double blind test, the test subjects themselves could still not reliably identify which samples were the ones containing thujone. As most people describe the effects of absinthe as a more lucid and aware drunk, this suggests that thujone is not the cause of any of absinthe’s alleged secondary effects.

==Regulations==
Currently, most countries do not have a legal definition of absinthe (unlike [[Scotch whisky]] or [[cognac (spirit)|cognac]]). Manufacturers can label a product 'absinthe' or 'absinth', whether or not it matches the traditional definition. Due to many countries never banning absinthe, not every country has regulations specifically governing it.

===Australia===
[[Bitters]] can contain a maximum 35 mg/kg thujone, other alcoholic beverages can contain a maximum 10 mg/kg<ref>[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/fsc_1_4_1_Contaminants_v78.pdf Standard 1.4.1 Contaminants and Natural Toxicants.] Food Standards Australia New Zealand. Retrieved 25 May 2006.</ref> of thujone. In Australia, import and sales require a special permit although absinthe is readily available in many [[bottle shop]]s. It is unresolved  as to whether or not absinthe is permitted in luggage in non-commercial quantities for personal use.  While the legislation would appear to be clear, it is sold by duty-free retailers at 'Arrivals' at Australian international airports such as Kingsford Smith.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], [[liquor laws]] are under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. [[British Columbia]] has no limits on thujone content; [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]] and [[Nova Scotia]] allow 10 mg/kg thujone; and all other provinces do not allow the sale of absinthe containing thujone (although, in [[Saskatchewan]], one can purchase any liquor, with a minimum of one case, usually 12 bottles x 750 ml or 8 x 1L). Individual liquor boards must approve each product before it may be sold, and currently only Hill’s Absinth, Czech Absinth s.r.o., Elie-Arnaud Denoix, Pernod, Absente, Versinthe and, in limited release, La Fée Absinthe are approved.  Like any alcohol, absinthe can only be imported by the proper government agencies and imports by individuals to a private address are prohibited.

Production is also regulated by the provincial government.  Recently, Okanagan Spirits in British Columbia was allowed to distill a traditional style of absinthe that closely resembles absinthes from France and Switzerland.  

Okanagan Spirits, a distillery based in Vernon BC, has produced Taboo, which has been approved for sale in BC, Alberta and Ontario and is even available on the shelves of BC’s provincially-run liquor stores.  This is Canada’s only authentic absinthe, made using a traditional recipe.

===European Union===
The European Union permits a maximum thujone level of 10 mg/kg in alcoholic beverages with more than 25% ABV, and 35 mg/kg in alcohol labeled as bitters.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out162_en.pdf Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on Thujone], [[European Commission]]. SCF/CS/FLAV/flavor/23 ADD2 Final [[6 February]] 2003.</ref> Member countries regulate absinthe production within this framework.

[[Image:Affiche absinthe.jpg|thumb|200px|''The end of the Green Fairy'' (1910): Critical poster by [[Albert Gantner]] illustrating the absinthe ban in Switzerland.]]

===France===
In addition to EU standards, products explicitly called 'absinthe' cannot be sold in France, although they can be produced for export. Absinthe is now commonly labeled as ''spiritueux à base de plantes d’absinthe'' ('wormwood-based spirits'). France also regulates [[fenchone]], a chemical in the herb fennel, to 5 mg/l.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/ADHJA.htm Décret n°88-1024 du 2 novembre 1988]. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref> This makes many brands of Swiss absinthe illegal without reformulation.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland the sale and production of absinthe was prohibited from 1910 to 2005, but the ban was lifted on March 1, 2005.  To be legally made or sold in Switzerland, absinthe must be distilled and either uncolored or naturally colored.

{{Refimprovesect|date=May 2008}}

===United States===
According to [[US Customs and Border Protection|U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] literature, "The importation of Absinthe and any other liquors or liqueurs that contain ''Artemisia absinthium'' is prohibited."<ref>[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/vacation/kbyg/prohibited_restricted.xml#AbsintheAlcohol Prohibited and Restricted Items]. US Customs and Border Protection. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref> On the other hand, FDA regulations  allow Artemisia species in foods or beverages, but those that contain Artemisia species, white cedar, [[Oakmoss|oak moss]], tansy or yarrow, must be thujone free.<ref>[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/FCF172.html Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Chapter 1, Part 172 - Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption]. US Food and Drug Administration. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref> Other herbs that contain thujone have no restrictions. For example, sage and [[sage oil]] (which can be almost 50% thujone<ref name="sage oil"/>) are on the FDA’s list of substances [[generally recognized as safe]].<ref>[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fcf182.html Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Chapter 1, Part 182 - Substances Generally Recognized as Safe]. US Food and Drug Administration. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref>

The prevailing consensus of interpretation of [[law of the United States|United States law]] and regulations among American absinthe connoisseurs is that it is probably legal to purchase such a product for personal use in the US. It is prohibited to sell items meant for human consumption which contain thujone derived from ''Artemisia'' species. (This derives from a [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulation, as opposed to a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] regulation.) Customs regulations specifically forbid the importation of 'absinthe'. Absinthe can be and occasionally is seized by United States Customs if it appears to be for human consumption and can be seized inside the US with a warrant.<ref>[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode19/usc_sec_19_00001595----000-.html US CODE: Title 19,1595.

So will I get arrested for possession of absinthe in the U.S.?" Retrieved 12 May 2006.</ref>

A faux-absinthe liquor called [[Absente]], made with ''southern wormwood'' (''[[Artemisia abrotanum]]'') instead of grande wormwood (''[[Artemisia absinthium]]''), is sold legally in the United States and does not contain grande wormwood.  This was the first US approval referring to "absinthe" on the front label; the front label says "Absinthe Refined" but the US [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB) classified the product as liqueur.

In 2007, TTB relaxed the US absinthe ban, and approved several brands for sale.<ref>[http://www.bevlaw.com/absinthe.htm Absinthe, a Collection of TTB Label Approvals], Lehrman Beverage Law.

===Vanuatu===
The Absinthe (Prohibition) Act 1915, passed in the [[New Hebrides]], has never been repealed, and is included in the 1988 [[Vanuatu]] consolidated legislation, and contains the following all-encompassing restriction: The manufacture, importation, circulation and sale wholesale or by retail of absinthe or similar liquors in Vanuatu shall be prohibited.<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/vu/legis/consol_act/aa215/ Absinthe (Prohibition) Act [Cap 4], Laws of the Republic of Vanuatu Revised Edition 1988]</ref>
Absinthe is now legal.
