'''Fetoscopy''' is an endoscopic procedure during [[pregnancy]] to allow access to the [[fetus]], the [[amniotic cavity]], the [[umbilical cord]], and the fetal side of the [[placenta]]. A small (3-4 mm) incision is made in the [[abdomen]], and an [[endoscope]] is inserted through the [[abdominal wall]] and [[uterus]] into the amniotic cavity. Fetoscopy allows medical interventions such as a [[biopsy]] or a [[laser]] occlusion of abnormal blood vessels.
