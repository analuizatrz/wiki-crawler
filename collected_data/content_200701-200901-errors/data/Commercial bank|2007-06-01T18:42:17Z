{{Banking}}
A '''commercial bank''' is a type of [[financial intermediary]] and a type of [[bank]]. Commercial bank has two possible meanings:

*Commercial bank is the term used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank.  

:This is what people normally call a "bank". The term "commercial" was used to distinguish it from an [[investment bank]]. Since the two types of banks no longer have to be separate companies, some have used the term "commercial bank" to refer to banks which focus mainly on companies. In some English-speaking countries outside North America, the term "trading bank" was and is used to denote a commercial bank. After the great depression and the stock market crash of 1929, the U.S. Congress passed the Glass-Steagal Act 1930 (Khambata 1996) requiring that commercial banks only engage in banking activities (accepting deposits and making loans, as well as other fee based services), whereas investment banks were limited to capital markets activities. This separation is no longer mandatory.

:It raises funds by collecting [[deposit account|deposit]]s from businesses and consumers via [[checkable deposit]]s, [[savings deposit]]s, and [[time deposit|time (or term) deposit]]s.  It makes [[loan]]s to businesses and consumers.  It also buys [[corporate bond]]s and [[government bond]]s.  Its primary [[liabilities]] are deposits and primary [[assets]] are loans and bonds.

*Commercial banking can also refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses, as opposed to normal individual members of the public (retail banking).
