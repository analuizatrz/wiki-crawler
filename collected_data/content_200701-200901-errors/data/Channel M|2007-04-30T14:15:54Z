'''Channel M''' is a television station which is based in [[Manchester]]. Originally named "[[Manchester Student Television]]", the channel's output is specifically designed for [[Greater Manchester]]. It began broadcasting on 14 February 2000.

The main sources of content used to be [[CHUM Limited|CHUM]], [[Euronews]], Channel M's In-House Productions and the [[University of Salford]]. However, recently there has been considerable investment and the development of a raft of own developed content, focusing on news, music, lifestyle  and sport across Greater Manchester.

"Channel M" is now owned by GMG hence the investment and increase in content. The channel no longer uses Salford University as a source for content

==Coverage==
As an [[Restricted Service Licence|RSL]] station Channel M was primarily available [[free to air]] in a small area of Manchester. In 2004 Channel M launched on the [[NTL]] platform (now part of [[Virgin Media]]), but the biggest increase in viewership was when the channel launched on the [[Sky Digital (UK)| Sky Digital]] Satellite platform in April 2006. When the channel launched on Sky it was the first [[Restricted Service Licence|RSL]] channel to broadcast on satellite. This gave the television station UK-wide coverage on the BSkyB service. 

The channel can be received on channel 39 (615 MHz) in some western and southern areas of the city, on [[Virgin Media]] Channel 878 around [[Greater Manchester]], [[Lancashire|Mid-Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]] also [[Sky Digital (UK)|Sky]] Channel 203. The service is not yet available on [[Freeview]].

The channel also become the first broadcaster in the region to offer its programmes on demand via broadband TV on its award winning website. [http://www.channelm.co.uk]

==Channel M News==
The main focus for Channel M is its news and current affairs programming. The weekday evening news service '''Channel M News Live''' is filmed at 5pm and is repeated in half-hour bulletins from 5.30-7pm as '''Channel M News'''. In 2006 '''Channel M News at Nine''' was launched and broadcasts from 9-10pm, providing a more in-depth look at the city's news stories.

'''Channel M Breakfast''' broadcasts from 6-9am every morning. The format is unusual with the presenting team using a five-person format. Byron Evans, Steph Elmore & Nina Warhurst are the anchors there are also two other main presenters "on the sofa" during the show an entertainment and sports specialist. The News headlines are read by a news reporter rotating every six weeks and the 15 minute Traffic, Travel and Weather updates are read by Michelle Totton. When the show started on Monday 16th April 2007 it replaced the [[Euronews]] feed which broadcast on Channel M in the same timeslot.

Channel M News Bulletins are filmed at the Channel M News Studio located in The [[Urbis]] Museum in [[Manchester City Centre]]. Until [[August 2005]] the news service was broadcast from [[The Printworks]] entertainment complex which is nearby.  Due to a week-long exhibition at the [[Urbis]] building in January 2007, Channel M News was filmed from the Newsroom of the [[Guardian Media Group]]'s '''MEN Media''' Building in [[Spinningfields]], Manchester, where some of the news-gathering operations are based.

Channel M News is anchored by former [[BBC North West]] presenters Heather Stott (at 9 O'Clock) and Andy Crane (at 5 O'Clock and 9 O'Clock). Manchester Evening News Columnist, '''Channel M Breakfast''' and '''City Life''' Anchor Byron Evans also features regularly as a Channel M News Presenter.

==Original Programming==
The channel's biggest success seems recently to be the comedy talk-show 'Frank Sidebottom's Proper Telly Show in b/w' along with its particularly strong music coverage; hardly surprising given the city's musical heritage. With these shows, the channel is starting to attract a lot of interest nationally. 

Sport programming such as '''Talking Sharks''', '''FC United-The Fans' Club''', '''Seconds Out''' and '''Inside MCFC''' broadcast news and content from Greater Manchester's sporting teams.

Music and entertainment programming is broadcast at the 8pm slot and through the daytime schedule. '''City Life''', '''The Great Northern Music Show''', '''Style In The City''' and '''City Centre Social''' feature celebrity interviews; music, food and fashion news from around Manchester.

At 4pm and intervals throughout the day '''Manchester Music''' is broadcast, which almost replaces the [[CHUM Television]]'s North American music output on the channel.

Travel-Style Magazine '''I Love Manchester''' is an hour long review, showcasing an area of Manchester in each episode. The programme explores entertainment, fashion, food and a hidden side to parts of city. The programme has ran two series and is presented by Breakfast anchor Steph Elmore.

==Advertising==
Channel M's extremely localised audience, is unsual for a British television channel. This promotes an oppertunity for local advertising, because of this the majority of the commercials are produced by local companies attempting to attract this Greater Manchester audience. Large companies like [[Ikea]] and [[DFS]] have also advertised on channel M, the former during the opening of Greater Manchester's first Ikea store in [[Ashton-Under-Lyne]]. Channel M also offers organisations an opportunity to create a television advertisement, as the channel also films, edits and produces advertisements.

==The Future==
After music guru [[Anthony Wilson]]'s switch from [[ITV Granada]], He will present a new Friday evening entertainment show called '''The New Friday''' which will be produced by former Granada producer Eamonn O'Neill. Wilson is currently recovering from surgery, so this programme was postponed.

==Manchester Media==
Other broadcasting headquarters in Manchester include [[ITV]]'s [[Granada Television]]and [[BBC]]'s Northern England hub. Channel M is owned by the [[Guardian Media Group]] which also publishes [[The Guardian]] and [[The Observer]] National Newspapers, The [[Manchester Evening News]] and Greater Manchester's Weekly Newspapers.

In 2005, the channel won the "Best Newcomer" award at the [[Royal Television Society]] Awards.
