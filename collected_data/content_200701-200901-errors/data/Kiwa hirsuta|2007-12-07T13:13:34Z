'''''Kiwa hirsuta''''' is a [[crustacean]] discovered in 2005 in the South [[Pacific Ocean]]&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | author = E. Macpherson, W. Jones & M. Segonzac | year = 2006 | title = [http://www.mnhn.fr/museum/front/medias/publication/6892_z05n4a3.pdf A new squat lobster family of Galatheoidea (Crustacea, Decapoda, Anomura) from the hydrothermal vents of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge] | journal = [[Zoosystema]] | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 709–723}}</ref>. This [[Decapoda|decapod]], which is approximately 15&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (6&nbsp;[[inch]]es) long, is notable for the quantity of silky blond [[seta]]e (resembling fur) covering its [[pereiopod]]s ([[thorax|thoracic]] legs, including [[claw]]s). Its discoverers dubbed it the "[[yeti]] [[lobster]]" or "yeti [[crab]]"&nbsp;<ref name="BBC">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4785482.stm |title='Furry lobster' found in Pacific |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=[[2006-03-08]]}}</ref>.

''K. hirsuta'' was discovered in March 2005 by a group organised by Robert Vrijenhoek of the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] in [[Monterey, California]] and Michel Segonzac of the [[Ifremer]]., using the [[submarine]] [[DSV Alvin|DSV ''Alvin'']], operating from RV ''Atlantis''&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbari.org/expeditions/eastermicroplate/ |title=Easter Microplate Expedition March 12–April 6, 2005 |publisher=[[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]]}}</ref>. The discovery was announced on the 7th of March, 2006. It was found 1,500&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] (900&nbsp;[[mile]]s) south of [[Easter Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], at a depth of 2,200&nbsp;[[metre|m]] (7,200&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]]), living on [[hydrothermal vent]]s along the [[Pacific-Antarctic Ridge]]&nbsp;<ref>{{cite news | title = French Journal Says New Crustacean Found | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/07/ap/tech/mainD8G71SI05.shtml | date=[[2006-03-07]] |publisher=[[CBS News]]}}</ref>. Based on both [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[molecular biology|molecular data]], the species was deemed to form a new [[genus]] and [[family (biology)|family]] ('''Kiwaidae'''). The animal has strongly reduced eyes that lack [[pigment]], and is thought to be blind.

The 'hairy' pincers contain [[filamentation|filamentous]] [[bacteria]], which the creature may use to detoxify poisonous minerals from the water emitted by the hydrothermal vents where it lives. Alternatively, it may feed on the bacteria, although it is thought to be a general [[carnivore]]&nbsp;<ref name="BBC" />. Its diet also consists of green [[algae]] and small [[shrimp]].

Although it is often referred to as the "furry lobster" outside the [[scientific literature]]&nbsp;<ref name="BBC"/>, ''Kiwa hirsuta'' is not a true [[lobster]] but is more closely related to [[squat lobster]]s and [[hermit crab]]s. The term "furry lobster" is more commonly used for the genus ''[[Palinurellus]]''.

==Etymology==
Macpherson ''et al.'' named the genus ''Kiwa'' after "the goddess of the shellfish in the Polynesian mythology", although [[Kiwa (mythology)|Kiwa]] is a male guardian of the sea in [[Maori mythology]]&nbsp;<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Elsdon Best]] | title = The Maori - Volume 1 | chapter = IV. Cosmogony and Anthropogeny | pages = 89–105 | chapterurl = http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bes01Maor-t1-body-d4.html |year=1924}}</ref>. ''Hirsuta'' means "hairy" in [[Latin]].
