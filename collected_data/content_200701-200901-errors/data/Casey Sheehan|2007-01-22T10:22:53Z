==Military service==
In [[May 2000]], Sheehan enlisted in the [[United States Army]] as a light-wheeled vehicle mechanic, [[List of United States Army MOS#CMF 63 - Mechanical Maintenance|MOS 63B]]. It has been reported that he had originally considered enlisting as a [[Chaplain]]'s assistant 
[[List of United States Army MOS # Chaplain Branch|MOS 56M]]. <!-- citation overlinked --> (Sheehan had acted as an [[altar server]] during the [[Palm Sunday]] mass on the morning of his death).<ref> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42498-2005Feb21.html For Some, a Loss in Iraq Turns Into Antiwar Activism: Gold Star Families Band Together to 'Make People Care'], ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[February 22]] [[2005]] </ref> 

Near the end of his tour of duty, the US invasion of Iraq began. Sheehan re-enlisted, knowing that his unit would be sent to [[Iraq]]<ref>[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=1860 Cindy Sheehan Has an Agenda], ''American Chronicle''</ref>. Sheehan's division, the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|First Cavalry Division]], was sent to Iraq. On [[March 19]], [[2004]], Sheehan's unit, Charlie Battery, 1st Battalion , [[82nd Field Artillery Regiment]] arrived at [[Forward Operating Base|FOB]] War Eagle in [[Sadr City]].

The chapel at Fort Hood started a new [[Knights of Columbus]] chapter that was named the Specialist Casey Austin Sheehan Council.<ref> [http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/081305B.shtml Mother's Vigil Recalls Quiet, Dedicated Son], ''[[Associated Press]]'', [[August 13]] [[2005]] </ref> 

Sheehan is buried in Vacaville-Elmira Cemetery in Vacaville, California. As of May 2006, his mother had provided a tombstone at his grave following criticism that Casey, who died in 2004, lacked a gravestone.  Cindy paid for the tombstone herself, stating "It is important for the rest of Casey's family to have one... I guess the pain of seeing it etched in marble that he is dead is another pain I will have to deal with."  Cindy maintains that the United States "government should have paid for it because of its responsibility for his death." The [[Department of Veterans Affairs]] does provide such monuments upon request.<ref> [http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/sheehangrave.asp Claim: Cindy Sheehan failed to provide a tombstone for her son's grave -- Status: true], ''[[Urban Legends Reference Pages|Snopes]]'' </ref>

In 2005, an untrue rumor circulated that Casey Sheehan had been raised by his father alone, after his parents had divorced and remarried.<ref> [http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/sheehan.asp Claim: Cindy Sheehan's son, Casey, was raised by her ex-husband after the couple divorced and both remarried -- Status: false], ''[[Urban Legends Reference Pages|Snopes]]'' </ref>
