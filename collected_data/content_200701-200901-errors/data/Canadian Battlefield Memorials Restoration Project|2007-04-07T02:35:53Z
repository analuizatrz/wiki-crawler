[[Canada]]'s 13 [[First World War]] memorials were erected to honour and remember the achievements and sacrifices of [[Canadians]] and [[Newfoundland]]ers during the Great War. In May 2001, the [[Government of Canada]] announced a major $30-million restoration project to restore and rehabilitate Canada's memorial sites in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner.

Eight of these memorials stand on notable Canadian battlefields: [[Vimy Ridge]], Bourlon Wood, Courcelette, Dury, Hill 62 (Sanctuary Wood), Le Quesnel, [[Passchendaele]] and St. Julien. The other five memorials mark places of historical significance to the then [[Dominion of Newfoundland]]: [[Beaumont-Hamel]], [[Gueudecourt]], Monchy-le-Preux, Masni√®res, and [[Courtrai]]. Collectively, they are symbolic of the Canadians and Newfoundlanders who gave their lives during the First World War, and are physical reminders that their sacrifices and victories must never be forgotten.

The repair work required to rehabilitate these memorial sites, now an average of 75 years old, is beyond the scope of routine maintenance. The program of work is being carried out in collaboration with [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]], the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] and other specialists, consultants and military historians. The work is separated into 4 project areas, with the restoration of the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial]] being the main priority.
