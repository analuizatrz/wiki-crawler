'''Interlingua''' is an [[international auxiliary language]] (IAL) published in [[1951]] by the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA). It is the most widely used [[International auxiliary language#Classification|naturalistic]] auxiliary language.<ref name="gopsill1990">{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.||title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}}</ref>

Interlingua's underlying design philosophy is completely [[a posteriori]]; its features, most notably its vocabulary, are intended to be seen not so much as a creation, but rather as an extraction of that what is common to the widest possible range of languages.<ref name="iala1971">IALA (1971).</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gode|first=Alexander||authorlink=Alexander Gode|year=1959|title=Manifesto de Interlingua|journal=Novas de Interlingua|volume=4|issue=March-April|url=http://starter5.aitcom.net/interlinguaus/pakupaku/uploads//GodeManifestodeInterlingua.pdf|language=Interlingua|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> The largest number of Interlingua words are of [[Latin language|Latin]] origin and have entered Interlingua through the Romance languages. The second and third largest number are words of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Germanic language|Germanic]] origin. Still other words originate in [[Slavic language|Slavic]] and non-Western languages.<ref name="iala1971">IALA (1971).</ref> The grammar of Interlingua is simple when compared to its source languages (but not so when compared to other, schematic constructed languages).<ref>Gopsill, F. P. ''Interlingua: A course for beginners.'' Part 1. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1987. Gopsill, here and elsewhere, characterizes Interlingua as having a simple grammar and no irregularities.</ref><ref>The grammar is simple in the sense that it contains no grammatical feature which is absent from any of its source languages (see Gode (1955), "introduction"), but still contains a multitude of what can be considered to be irregularities (and is acknowledged as such by Gode), although many of them are optional (see for example Gode (1955), §25, §37, §47, §49, §51, §97, §101, §104, §129, §137, §146, §148-§150, §152, Appendix 1: Double-Stem Verbs, etc.).</ref>

Interlingua is unusual for being immediately understandable to populations numbering in the hundreds of millions. Conversely, it can be &ndash; and is &ndash; used as an introduction to resembling natural languages.<ref name="gopsill1990">{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.||title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}}</ref>

== Rationale ==

[[Image:Map-Romance_Language_World.png|300px|right|thumb|Areas where a Romance language is commonly spoken are coloured on the map. Interlingua should be well comprehensible to at least a large part of the more than <span style="white-space: nowrap">600 million</span> native Romance speakers alone.]]

The expansive movements of science, technology, trade, diplomacy, and the arts, combined with the historical dominance of the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] languages has resulted in a large common vocabulary among Western languages. With Interlingua a systematic procedure was (and is) used to extract and standardize the most widespread word or words for a concept found in a set of ''control languages'': [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], with [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] as secondary references. Words from any language are eligible for inclusion, so long as their internationality is shown by their presence in these control languages. Hence, Interlingua includes such diverse word forms as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''geisha'' and ''samurai'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''califa'', [[Aborigine|Aboriginal]] ''kanguru'', and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''sauna''.<ref name="iala1971">IALA (1971).</ref><ref name="gopsill&sexton1987">{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.|coauthors=B. C. Sexton|others=with the assistance of P. Berwick, F. Esterhill, and R.V. Spathaky|title=Concise English–Interlingua dictionary|url=http://www.interlingua.com/an/ceid/|accessdate=2007-03-04|edition=1st edition|year=1987|publisher=[[British Interlingua Society]]|location=[[Sheffield]]|isbn=0951169505|oclc=27976417}}</ref>

Interlingua combines this pre-existing vocabulary with a minimal grammar based on the control languages. People with a good knowledge of a [[Romance language]], or a smattering of a Romance language plus a good knowledge of the ''[[international scientific vocabulary]]'' can frequently understand it immediately on reading or hearing it. Educated speakers of [[English language|English]] also enjoy this easy comprehension.<ref>See for example Sexton, Brian C., "Interlingua at first hearing," ''Lingua e Vita'', 1995, Issue 83.</ref> The immediate comprehension of Interlingua, in turn, makes it unusually easy to learn. Speakers of [[language|other languages]] can also learn to speak and write Interlingua in a short time, thanks to its simple grammar and regular word formation using a small number of [[root]]s and [[affix]]es. {{POV-assertion}}

Once learned, Interlingua can be used to learn other related languages quickly and easily, and in some studies, even to understand them immediately. Research with [[Swedish language|Swedish]] students has shown that, after learning Interlingua, they can translate elementary texts from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. In one study in 1974, an Interlingua class translated a Spanish text that students who had taken 150 hours of Spanish found too difficult to understand. Gopsill has suggested that Interlingua's freedom from irregularities allowed the students to grasp quickly the mechanisms of language.<ref name="gopsill1990">{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.||title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}}</ref>{{dubious}}

Words in Interlingua retain their natural form; they are never distorted to fit a pre-existing grammar or set of rules. Each word retains its normal spelling, pronunciation, and meanings. For this reason, Interlingua is frequently termed a ''naturalistic'' IAL.

== History ==
{{splitsection|History of Interlingua}}
=== International Auxiliary Language Association ===
Ultimate credit for Interlingua must go to the American heiress [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]] (1874–1950), who became interested in [[linguistics]] and the [[international auxiliary language]] movement in the early 1920s. In [[1924]], Morris and her husband, [[Dave Hennen Morris]], established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in [[New York City]]. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis. Morris developed the research program of IALA in consultation with [[Edward Sapir]], [[William Edward Collinson]], and [[Otto Jespersen]].<ref>Falk, Julia S. "Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States, ''Language and Communication'', 15(3): pp. 241-259. Pergamon, 1995.</ref>

The IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, Sapir's cross-linguistic semantic studies of totality (1930) and grading phenomena (1944). Morris herself edited Sapir and [[Morris Swadesh]]'s 1932 cross-linguistic study of ending-point phenomena, and Collinson's 1937 study of indication. Although the Morrises and their family provided most of IALA's funding, it also received support from such prestigious groups as the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].<ref name="gopsill1990">{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.||title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}}</ref>

In its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about [[language]]s and [[interlinguistics]]; and comparing extant IALs, including [[Esperanto]], [[Esperanto II]], [[Ido]], [[Latino Sine Flexione]], [[Novial]], and [[Occidental language|Occidental]]. In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities.<ref name="iala1971_foreword">IALA (1971), "[http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-foreword.html Foreword]".</ref> It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, debating features and goals of their representative languages. With a "concession rule" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive.<ref name="gopsill1990">{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.||title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}}</ref>

At the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in [[Geneva]] in [[1931]], IALA began to break new ground. Its conference was attended by recognized linguists, 27 of whom signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in [[Rome]] in [[1933]].<ref name="gopsill1990">{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.||title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}}</ref>

Also in 1933, Professor [[Herbert N. Shenton]] of [[Syracuse University]] organized an intensive study of the problems encountered with interlanguages when used in international conferences. Later that same year, Dr. [[Edward L. Thorndike]] published a paper about the relative learning speeds of "natural" and "modular" constructed languages. Both Shenton and Thorndike were major influences on IALA's work from then on.<ref name="iala1971_foreword">IALA (1971), "[http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-foreword.html Foreword]".</ref>

In [[1937]], the first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published ''Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary''. However, the outbreak of [[World War II]] in [[1939]] cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.<ref name="gopsill1990">{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.||title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}}</ref>

===Development of a new language===
Originally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing [[interlanguage]]s were up to the task. By [[1937]], the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.

To that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., [[Novial]] and [[Occidental]]) or systematic (e.g., [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido]]) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Dr. Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many &ndash; or even a majority &ndash; of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a [[Procrustes|Procrustian bed]], forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where [[Ezra Clark Stillman|E. Clark Stillman]] established a new research staff. Stillman, with the assistance of Dr. [[Alexander Gode]], developed a ''prototyping'' technique &ndash; an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of ''control languages''.

In [[1943]] Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research. In [[1945]], IALA published a ''General Report'' &ndash; largely Morris's work &ndash; which presented three models for IALA's language:
* Model P was a naturalistic model that made no attempt to regularize the prototyped vocabulary. 
* Model E was lightly schematicized along the lines of [[Occidental]].
* Model K was moderately schematicized along the lines of [[Ido]] (i.e., somewhat less schematicized than [[Esperanto]]).

From [[1946]] to [[1948]], the renowned French linguist [[André Martinet]] was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. An initial survey gauged reactions to the three models of 1945. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.

Four models were canvassed: Model P and K, plus two new models similar to Model E of 1945.

|- valign=top
| &nbsp; || Model&nbsp;C || &nbsp; || slightly&nbsp;schematic || &nbsp; ||''Yo ha nascet, o deessa con le ocules azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuose Cimerios ''

|- valign=top
| &nbsp; || colspan=3 | (English) || &nbsp; ||'I was born, O goddess with the blue eyes, of barbarian relations, among the good and virtuous Cimmerians'
|}

Model P was unchanged from 1945; Model K was slightly modified in the direction of [[Ido]].

The results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models, C and K, were rejected &ndash; K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M attracted somewhat more support than P. Taking national biases into account (for example, the French who were polled disproportionately favored Model M), IALA decided on a compromise between models M and P, with certain elements of C.

===Finalization===
When Martinet took up a position at [[Columbia University]] in 1948, Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development.  His task was to combine elements of Model M and Model P; take the flaws seen in both by the polled community and repair them with elements of Model C as needed; and simultaneously develop a vocabulary.

The vocabulary and verb conjugations of Interlingua were first presented in [[1951]], when IALA published the finalized ''[[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|Interlingua Grammar]]'' and the 27,000-word ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary]]'' ([[IED]]). In [[1954]], IALA  published an introductory manual entitled ''[[Interlingua a Prime Vista]]'' ("Interlingua at First Sight").

===Success, decline, and resurgence===
 
An early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter ''Spectroscopia Molecular'', published from 1952 to 1980.<ref>Breinstrup, Thomas, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/spectroscopia.htm "Un revolution in le mundo scientific" (A revolution in the scientific world).] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> In 1954 Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress, in [[Washington DC]], for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. [[Science Service]], the publisher of ''Science Newsletter'' at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the powerful [[International Organization for Standardization]], which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries.<ref name="gopsill1990">{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F.

The [[International Auxiliary Language Association|IALA]] closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later.<ref name="esterhill2000">Esterhill, Frank, [http://www.interlingua.org/html/copy_of_ii-history.htm#_ednref19 ''Interlingua Institute: A History''.

Accessed January 16, 2007</ref> [[Hugh E.

The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua precis for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977.<ref name="esterhill2000">Esterhill, Frank, [http://www.interlingua.org/html/copy_of_ii-history.htm ''Interlingua Institute: A History''.] New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.</ref> 

The Interlingua Institute was adrift for a while after the deaths of Blair in 1967 and Gode in 1970. According to Esterhill,<ref>Esterhill, Frank, [http://www.interlingua.org/html/copy_of_ii-history.htm ''Interlingua Institute: A History''.] New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.</ref> however, publishing slowed only briefly in the late 1960s and revived soon afterward, at about the time of the 1971 second edition of the IED. Flourishing interest in [[Europe]] may have counterbalanced the struggles taking place in America.

Interlingua had attracted many former adherents of other international-language projects, notably [[Occidental]] and [[Ido]]. The former Occidentalist [[Richard Berger|Ric Berger]] founded The [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] ([[UMI]]) in 1955,<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/organisationes.htm Portrait del organisationes de interlingua.] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> and by the late 1950s, interest in Interlingua in Europe had already begun to overtake that in North America. Media coverage at the time, for example, was apparently heaviest in Northern and [[Eastern Europe]]. Frequent European coverage has continued to date, joined by media attention in [[South America]] in the early 1990s.<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/pressa.htm Interlingua in le pressa.] Accessed January 17, 2007.</ref>
 
Beginning in the 1980s UMI has held international conferences every two years (typical attendance at the earlier meetings was 50 to 100) and launched a publishing programme that eventually produced over 100 volumes. Other Interlingua-language works were published by university presses in [[Sweden]] and [[Italy]], and in the 1990s, [[Brazil]] and [[Switzerland]].<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/libros/pt.htm Bibliographia de Interlingua.] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/stenstrom.htm Biographias: Ingvar Stenström.] Accessed January 16, 2007</ref> Several [[Scandinavia]]n schools undertook projects that used Interlingua as a means of teaching the international scientific and intellectual vocabulary.

In 2000, the Interlingua Institute was dissolved amid funding disputes with the UMI; the American Interlingua Society, established the following year, succeeded the institute and responded to new interest emerging in [[Mexico]].<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/organisationes.htm Portrait del organisationes de interlingua.] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref>

===Behind the Iron Curtain===

Interlingua was spoken and promoted in the Soviet empire, in spite of persecution and efforts to suppress information about the language. In [[East Germany]], government officials confiscated the letters and magazines that the UMI sent to Walter Raédler, the Interlingua representative there.<ref>"Interlingua usate in le posta". [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/stampaspostal.htm Historia de Interlingua], 2001, revised 2006.</ref> In [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Július Tomin]] received threatening letters after his first article on Interlingua was published.<ref>Breinstrup, Thomas. "Persecutate pro parlar Interlingua." ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', 1995, Issue 5.</ref> Despite continuing persecution, he went on to become the Czech Interlingua representative, teach Interlingua in the school system, and author a long series of published articles and books.<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/tomin.htm Biographias: Július Tomin.

===Interlingua Today===
: ''See also: [[#Community|Community]]'' 

Today, interest in Interlingua has expanded from the scientific community to the general public. Individuals, governments, and private companies use Interlingua for learning and instruction, travel, online publishing, and communication across language barriers. Interlingua is promoted internationally by the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (president: Barbara Rubinstein, Sweden; secretary-general: Petyo Angelov, [[Bulgaria]]). Periodicals and books are produced by many national organizations, such as the [[Societate American pro Interlingua]] (president: Dr. [[Stanley Mulaik]]), the [[Swedish Society for Interlingua|Svenska Sällskapet för Interlingua]] (secretary: Ingvar Stenström), and the [[Brazilian Union for Interlingua]] (president: Gilson Passos).

Currently, [[Panorama In Interlingua]] is the most prominent of several Interlingua periodicals. It is a 28-page magazine published bimonthly that covers current events, science, editorials, and Interlingua. Thanks to the Internet, Interlingua has seen a resurgence over the last decade, with the number of speakers jumping tenfold by some estimates.

== Community ==
It's not certain how many people have an active knowledge of Interlingua, but their numbers have grown consistently over most of the past half-century. As noted above, Interlingua is the most widely spoken naturalistic [[auxiliary language]].

Interlingua's greatest advantage is that it is the most widely ''understood'' [[International Auxiliary Language]] (IAL) by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.

Interlingua has active speakers on all continents, especially in [[South America]] and in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Northern Europe]], most notably [[Scandinavia]]; also in [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. In [[Africa]], Interlingua has official representation in the [[Republic of the Congo]]. There are copious Interlingua web pages, including editions of Wikipedia and Wiktionary, and a number of periodicals, including ''Panorama in Interlingua'' from the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (UMI) and magazines of the national societies allied with it. There are several active mailing lists, and Interlingua is also in use in certain [[Usenet]] newsgroups, particularly in the europa.* hierarchy. Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.<ref>"Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua," ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', Issue 3, 2006.</ref> Interlingua was the "secret language" in the television series ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,'' which aired from 1964 to 1968.<ref>Lingua secrete de agentes in TV, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/themanfromuncle.htm Historia de Interlingua, 2001], Revised 2006.</ref> In recent years, samples of Interlingua have also been seen in music and anime.

Interlingua is taught in many high schools and universities, sometimes as a means of teaching other languages quickly, presenting [[interlinguistics]], or introducing the international vocabulary. The prestigious [[University of Granada]] in [[Spain]], for example, offers an Interlingua course in collaboration with the Centro de Formación Continue.<ref>"A notar," ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]],'' Issue 4, 2006.</ref>

Every two years, the UMI organizes an international conference in a different country; the most recent conference ([[2005]]), in [[Sweden]], was attended by slightly over 250 people. In the year between, the Scandinavian Interlingua societies co-organize a conference in Sweden. National organizations such as the Union Brazilian pro Interlingua also organize regular conferences.

===Orthography and pronunciation===

Interlingua uses the standard Latin alphabet with all its 26 letters and in general no diacritics. Keeping with its naturalistic design philosophy, Interlingua does not have a particularly [[phonemic orthography]] by international auxiliary language standards even if one were to consider [[digraph]]s as separate [[grapheme]]s.

For the most part, [[consonant]]s are pronounced as in English, while the [[vowel]]s are like Spanish. Unstressed vowels should not be pronounced as a schwa ([ə]), as could be the tendency of a speaker with an English language background.

The following table shows the circumstances in which a letter must or may be pronounced differently than the corresponding [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] value of its lowercase form; there is however, a considerable latitude granted to any prospective speaker when choosing the particular [[allophone]] to realize a phoneme, thus allowing for the influence of his or her native language habits as long as it all remains within reason and doesn't hinder communication:<ref>Gode (1955), "[http://members.optus.net/~ado_hall/interlingua/gi/spelling/spelling_&_pronunciation.html spelling & pronunciation]".</ref>

Double consonants are pronounced as single. Interlingua has at least three falling [[diphthong]]s, {{IPA|/ai/, /au/ and /eu/}},<ref>IALA (1971), "[http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-spelling.html Spelling and Pronunciation]".</ref> but an exhaustive list is not given by either the official dictionary or the grammar.

==== Stress ====

The ''general rule'' is that stress falls on the vowel before the last consonant (e.g., ''l'''i'''ngua, ess'''e'''r, requirim'''e'''nto'', 'language', 'to be', 'requirement'), and where that isn't possible, on the first vowel (''v'''i'''a'', 'way', '''''i'''o cr'''e'''a'', 'I create'). There are a few exceptions, and the following rules account for most of them: 

* Adjectives and nouns ending in with a vowel followed by ''-le, -ne,'' or ''-re'' are stressed on the third-last syllable (''fr'''a'''gile, m'''a'''rgine, '''a'''ltere'' 'other', but ''illa imp'''o'''ne'' 'she imposes').
* Words ending in ''-ica/-ico, -ide/-ido'' and ''-ula/-ulo,'' are stressed on the third-last syllable (''pol'''i'''tica, scient'''i'''fico, r'''a'''pide, st'''u'''pido, cap'''i'''tula, s'''e'''culo'' 'century').
* Words ending in ''-ic'' are stressed on the second-last syllable (''c'''u'''bic'').
* The addition of a plural suffix doesn't change the stress of a noun (''cant'''o'''n'', ''cant'''o'''nes'').
* Verbs in the future tense are stressed on the final ''-a'' (''io scribe'''ra''''' 'I shall write').
* Verbs in the conditional tense are stressed on the second-last syllable (e.g. ''il esse'''re'''a sage'' 'it would be wise').

Users may allow their native habits to influence where they stress their words. For example, ''kilom'''e'''tro'' is acceptable, although ''kil'''o'''metro'' is preferred for etymological reasons.

==== Exceptions ====

Whenever the pronunciation or the stress of a word deviates from above rules, this is in principle indicated in the Interlingua-English Dictionary. Some are words that are (slightly) pronounced irregularly in the source languages of Interlingua and this causes the same to happen in Interlingua. An example is <chocolate>, which starts with a /ʃ/ (and is indicated in the dictionary with a "''(sh-)''" after the word).

Like its source languages, Interlingua also has a number of words that can be considered to be unassimilated [[loanword]]s of foreign origin; they exhibit traits that can deviate even more wildly from the norm. Not only can they be pronounced differently than the spelling suggests, but they can even exhibit foreign sounds like the [[voiceless velar fricative]] [x] and the [[close front rounded vowel]] [y], or the spelling may contain [[diacritic]]s or other marks. If, however, the diacritics would be superfluous given the pronunciation system of Interlingua, they are removed.

=== Phonotactics ===

Interlingua has no explicitly defined [[phonotactics]]. However, the prototyping procedure for determining Interlingua words, which strives for internationality, should in general lead naturally to word shapes that are easy for most learners to pronounce. In the process of building new words through [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]], an affix cannot always be added without some kind of modification in between. A good example is the plural ''-s'', which is always preceded by a vowel to prevent the occurrence of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end. These measures, however, come at the expense of making the rules of the language more complicated; in this example, this is manifested in the stress rules mentioned above, where an additional rule is necessary in order to prevent that pluralizing a word (unnaturally) causes a different syllable to be stressed. An example where Interlingua phonotactics does prove to be possibly challenging for many speakers would be when trying to pronounce words that start with <pn>, <ps> or <pt>.

== Vocabulary ==
{{See also|Interlingua vocabulary|Interlingua dictionaries}}

The vocabulary of Interlingua is built in a systematic manner from existing source or ''control'' languages. These languages are foremost the four most spoken [[Romance languages]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], and the most spoken [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], [[English language|English]]; the second most spoken Germanic language, [[German language|German]], and the most spoken [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]], [[Russian language|Russian]], play the role of backup languages. Because the [[Iberian Romance languages|Iberian languages]], Spanish and Portuguese, are more closely related to each other than any other pair of control languages, they are treated as a combined unit.

=== Eligibility ===

A word, that is a form with meaning, enters the Interlingua vocabulary if it is in any way attested to in at least '''three''' of four control units, including archaically and/or "potentially". At first, only the Romance languages and English are considered; if the procedure fails for a concept that has a word in all these languages, German or Russian can take the place of a unit.

A word can be "potentially" present when a word seems to be a [[derivation (linguistics)|derivative]], but the suggested root doesn't actually exist in the language itself (example: English ''proximity'' giving support to Interlingua ''proxime'', meaning 'near, close'); this counts as long as there exists a language that actually does have this basic root. Another case where "potentiality" can lead to sufficient international support for a word is when a concept is represented as a derivative or a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] by a control language, its constituent [[morpheme]]s are themselves attested to and their combination adequately cover the meaning of the larger word (example: Italian ''fiammifero'' (lit: flamebearer), meaning "match, lucifer", leading to Interlingua ''flammifero''); this word is thus said to be "potentially" present in the other languages despite the fact they may represent the meaning with a single morpheme.

Words do not just enter the Interlingua vocabulary just because [[cognate]]s exist in sufficient languages; if [[semantic change|their meanings have become different over time]], they are considered different words for the purpose of Interlingua etymology, although the occurrence of overlap in [[polysemy]] can still cause a word shape to enter Interlingua, if only with a restricted set of meanings that are each separately sufficiently supported.

The official dictionary was not explicit in saying what course of action had been taken in case the procedure still failed (which almost only occurs with [[grammatical particle]]s), but the listing shows that in that case the word for the concept had simply been taken directly from [[Latin]] (see below).

=== Form ===

The form of an Interlingua word is designed to be an "international prototype" with respect to the other words; on the one hand it should be neutral in the sense it is free from characteristics peculiar to one language, on the other hand it should maximally capture the non-specific characteristics such that transforming it into any of the contributing variants would depend only on these same language specific characteristics. If the word has any derivatives that occur in the source languages with appropriate parallel meanings, then their [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] connection must remain intact; for example, the Interlingua word for 'time' is spelled ''tempore'' and not ''*tempus'' or ''*tempo'' in order to match it with its derived adjective ''temporal''.

The language specific characteristics are closely related to the [[sound law]]s of the individual languages; the resulting words are often close to or even identical with the most recent ancestral form common to the contributing words, which usually corresponds with that of [[Vulgar Latin]]/Proto-Romance. However, as a counterexample, just because English can contribute to a cognate does not mean that the resulting prototype will go all the way back to where English meets the Romance languages and be [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]].

General example: The French ''oeil'', Italian ''occhio'', Spanish ''ojo'' and Portuguese ''olho'', 'eye', appear quite different, but they descend from a historical form ''oculus''. This, and international derivatives like ''ocular'' and ''oculista'', determine the form ''oculo'' to be used in Interlingua.

=== Evolution of Interlingua vocabulary ===

New words can be derived internally &ndash; that is, from existing Interlingua words &ndash; or extracted from the control languages in the manner of the original vocabulary. Internal word-building, though freer than in the control languages, is more limited than in schematic IALs.

For the dictionary to simply pick the Latin word in case all else fails has become controversial to the point of Interlingua users making their own (subjective) choices for word form. Examples include ''emer'' being replaced by southern Romance ''comprar'' (meaning 'to buy'), because the former only occurs as a cognate in derivatives of the source languages and ''nimis'' being replaced with southern Romance ''troppo'' (meaning 'too (much)'). The prototype for 'but' is technically ''mais'', but the dictionary still lists Latin ''sed'' and some have rejected them both in favor of Italian (and [[Occidental language|Occidental]]) ''ma''.

== Grammar ==
{{details|Interlingua grammar}}

The design philosophy behind the grammar of Interlingua was that it was to contain exactly every grammatical feature that is present in all of the main control languages and that the form of these features were to be determined in as much the same way as the vocabulary was.<ref name="gode1955">Gode (1955).</ref>

This had led to Interlingua having a grammar similar to that of the Romance languages, but greatly simplified, primarily under the influence of English, since if a grammatical feature was absent from so much as one of the primary control languages, it was dropped. Thus, Interlingua has no [[agreement (linguistics)|noun-adjective agreement]] by either gender, case, or number (cf. Spanish and Portuguese ''gatos negros'', 'black cats'), since this is absent from English, it has no progressive verb tenses (English ''I am reading''), since they are absent from French, and the definite article ''le'' is invariable, as in English. Conversely, Interlingua does have a [[grammatical number|singular-plural distinction of nouns]] since all the control languages do.

Nouns have no [[grammatical gender]].<ref name="gode1955">Gode (1955).</ref><ref name="wilgenhof1995">Wilgenhof, Karel. ''Grammatica de Interlingua''. Union Mundial pro Interlingua, Beekbergen, Netherlands, 1995.</ref> Plurals are formed by adding ''-s'' after a final vowel, ''-hes'' after a final ''-c'' and ''-es'' after a different final consonant.<ref name="gode1955">Gode (1955).</ref> [[Personal Pronouns]] take one form for the subject, one for the (in)direct object and reflexive (except for the third person cases, where the reflexive forms are all of the distinct form ''se'') and two for the possessives (depending on the relative position of the pronoun with respect to article and noun).<ref name="gode1955">Gode (1955).</ref><ref name="wilgenhof1995">Wilgenhof, Karel. ''Grammatica de Interlingua''. Union Mundial pro Interlingua, Beekbergen, Netherlands, 1995.</ref> Most [[adverb]]s are derived regularly from [[adjective]]s by adding ''-mente'' (or ''-amente'' after a ''-c''). An adverb can be formed from any adjective in this way.<ref>Brauers, Karl. ''Grammatica synoptic de Interlingua''. Morges, Switzerland: Editiones Interlingua, 1975.</ref>

The verb system is a simplified version of the systems found in the Romance languages. Verbs take the same form for all persons (''io, tu, illa vive'', 'I live', 'you live', 'she lives'). The only exceptions are some optional forms for ''esser'', 'to be'. The [[indicative]] (''pare'', 'appear', 'appears') is the same as the [[imperative]] (''pare!'' 'appear!'), and there is no [[subjunctive]] except one for ''esser'', ''sia''.<ref name="gode1955">Gode (1955).</ref> Three common verbs usually take short forms in the present tense: ''es'' for 'is', 'am', 'are;' ''ha'' for 'has', 'have;' and ''va'' for 'go', 'goes'.<ref name="wilgenhof1995">Wilgenhof, Karel. ''Grammatica de Interlingua''. Union Mundial pro Interlingua, Beekbergen, Netherlands, 1995.</ref> A few irregular verb forms are available, but rarely used.<ref>These forms are found in Wilgenhof, who stops short of calling them irregular verb forms. Two such forms appear in Gode and Blair, and one is labeled irregular; none are in Brauers.</ref>

There are four simple tenses/moods (the present, past, and future tenses and the conditional mood) and four compound tenses/moods/voices (the past and future tenses, the conditional mood, and the passive voice). These compound structures employ an auxiliary plus the infinitive or the past participle (e.g., ''Ille ha arrivate'', 'He has arrived').<ref name="gode1955">Gode (1955).</ref> Simple and compound tenses can be combined in various ways to express more complex tenses (e.g., ''Nos haberea morite'', 'We would have died').<ref>See for example Gode (1955), [http://members.optus.net/~ado_hall/interlingua/gi/parts_of_speech/verb.html#115 §115, "Table of Conjugation"], pp. 38-40.</ref>

Word order is generally [[Subject Verb Object|Subject–Verb–Object]], except that a direct object or reflexive pronoun comes before the verb if the sentence is in a non-imperative simple tense/mood (''Io les vide'', 'I see them'); this change of word order to [[Subject Object Verb|Subject–Object–Verb]] comes from the Romance languages.<ref name="gode1955">Gode (1955).</ref><ref name="wilgenhof1995">Wilgenhof, Karel. ''Grammatica de Interlingua''. Union Mundial pro Interlingua, Beekbergen, Netherlands, 1995.</ref> Adjectives may precede or follow the nouns they modify, but they most often follow it.<ref name="gode1955">Gode (1955).</ref> The position of adverbs is flexible, though constrained by common sense.<ref name="wilgenhof1995">Wilgenhof, Karel. ''Grammatica de Interlingua''. Union Mundial pro Interlingua, Beekbergen, Netherlands, 1995.</ref>

== Criticisms and controversies ==
{{see also|Irregularities and exceptions in Interlingua|Esperanto and Interlingua compared|Ido and Interlingua compared}}

While Interlingua is a successful auxiliary language, it has been criticised, often by proponents of other auxiliary languages, which usually focus on issues it was never meant to address. This may be partly because both opponents and supporters see Interlingua as a candidate for being ''the'' universal second "<u>neutral</u>" language for the world to use.

Being a European-based language, Interlingua is not easily presented as a neutral language for the whole world instead of just [[Europe]] or the [[Western world]], although one could argue that favoring some with the choice of vocabulary would be acceptable as long as it wouldn't make it harder for others to learn. Speakers of languages other than [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] have an additional disadvantage.

Conversely, Interlingua has been suggested as a useful language for study as an introduction to Indo-European languages in general, and Romance languages in particular. In fact, Interlingua has been taught at Swedish high schools for this purpose.

One point of criticism that does take Interlingua's design goals into account is that its credential as being "[[Standard Average European]]" is too weak outside the Romance languages. Some opponents see the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], and [[Celtic languages]], in particular, as having little influence. 

Proponents point out that Interlingua's source languages include not only Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages &ndash; still more when derivative forms and [[loan translation]]s are included. Tests showed that if a larger number of source languages were used, the results would be about the same. So, IALA  selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality. In addition, the grammar of Interlingua is still simpler than most or all Indo-European languages, contributing to ease of learning.

Finally, other auxiliary languages have a mix of words that is similar to Interlingua's, but accidentally hidden. Wordforms are frequently altered to fit pre-established rules of grammar and orthography. For example, all accusative adjectives might end in ''-en'', or the letter ''x'' might be replaced by combinations such as ''gz'' and ''ks''. In addition, some schematic languages contain words that look unfamiliar because they are entirely invented. Thus, the linguistic mix of the schematic auxiliary languages is not so much sweeping and inclusive as difficult to make out.

The [[Lord's Prayer]]:

: ''Nostre Patre, qui es in le celos,''
: ''que tu nomine sia sanctificate;''
: ''que tu regno veni;''
: ''que tu voluntate sia facite''
: ''super le terra como etiam in le celo.''
: ''Da nos hodie nostre pan quotidian,''
: ''e pardona a nos nostre debitas''
: ''como nos pardona a nostre debitores,''
: ''e non duce nos in tentation,''
: ''sed libera nos del mal.''

From an essay by Alexander Gode:

:''Interlingua se ha distachate ab le movimento pro le disveloppamento e le introduction de un lingua universal pro tote le humanitate. Si o non on crede que un lingua pro tote le humanitate es possibile, si o non on crede que interlingua va devenir un tal lingua es totalmente indifferente ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme. Le sol facto que importa (ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme) es que interlingua, gratias a su ambition de reflecter le homogeneitate cultural e ergo linguistic del occidente, es capace de render servicios tangibile a iste precise momento del historia del mundo. Il es per su contributiones actual e non per le promissas de su adherentes que interlingua vole esser judicate.''<ref>''Novas de Interlingua'', May/June 1958.</ref>

:Interlingua has detached itself from the movement for the development and introduction of a universal language for all humanity. Whether or not one believes that a language for all humanity is possible, whether or not one believes that Interlingua will become such a language is totally irrelevant from the point of view of Interlingua itself. The only fact that matters (from the point of view of Interlingua itself) is that Interlingua, thanks to its ambition of reflecting the cultural and thus linguistic homogeneity of the West, is capable of rendering tangible services at this precise moment in the history of the world. It is by its present contributions and not by the promises of its adherents that Interlingua wishes to be judged.
