{{GeographyTopicTOC}}

'''[[Geography]]''' is the study of the [[world]], its surface features, and of the distribution of life on [[Earth]], including human life and the effects of human activity. Geography is a diverse field and has two main branches, [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]], that seek to understand the world and all of its human and natural complexities &mdash; not just where objects are, but how they came to be, and how they have changed over time.  

The following list of topics is provided as an overview of and introduction to '''geography''':

== Branches of geography ==

Geography is divided into two main branches: [[physical geography]] and [[human geography]]. Each of these branches is divided into a number of subfields:<br clear=both>

''Regions'' are areas, and can be defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, and functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.

=== Regions of the world ===
{{main|Regional geography}}
''Regional geography'' is a branch of geography that studies the regions of all sizes across the [[Earth]]. It has a prevailing descriptive character. The main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region which consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization which covers the proper techniques of space delimitation into regions.

==== The Continents ====
{{main|Continent}}

A ''continent'' is one of several large [[landmass]]es on [[Earth]].  They are generally identified by [[convention]] rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:

===== Ecozone =====
{{main|Ecozone}}
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) developed a system of eight biogeographic realms (ecozones):
* [[Nearctic]] 22.9 mil. km² (including most of [[North America]])
* [[Palearctic]] 54.1 mil. km² (including the bulk of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]])
* [[Afrotropic]] 22.1 mil. km² (including [[Sub-Saharan Africa]])
* [[Indomalaya]] 7.5 mil. km² (including the [[Indian subcontinent|South Asian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]])
* [[Australasia ecozone|Australasia]] 7.7 mil. km² (including [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], and neighbouring islands).  The northern boundary of this zone is known as the [[Wallace line]].
* [[Neotropic]] 19.0 mil. km² (including [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]])
* [[Oceania ecozone|Oceania]] 1.0 mil. km² (including [[Polynesia]], [[Fiji]] and [[Micronesia]])
* [[Antarctic ecozone|Antarctic]] 0.3 mil. km² (including [[Antarctica]]).

===== Ecoregions =====
{{main|Ecoregion}}

Ecozones are further divided into ecoregions.  The World has over 800 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s.  ''See [[Lists of ecoregions by country]].''

==== Political divisions ====
{{main|Political division}}

A '''political division''', usually a [[country]], is a region under the control of a [[government]].  Countries are further divided into [[administrative division]]s including [[state (subnational)|states]], [[county|counties]], [[city|cities]], etc.

The ''Earth's Spheres'' relate to the division of the Earth into broadly four interacting spheres:

* [[Hydrosphere]] 
* [[Biosphere]] 
* [[Lithosphere]] 
* [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]] 

Other interpretations of this model of the Earth include the following additional spheres:

A ''landform'' is part of the [[terrain]], defined by its shape and location in the landscape, and is typically an element of [[topography]].  Landforms are characterized by aspects such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type.  Examples of landforms''':

==== Bodies of water ====
{{main|Body of water}}

A ''body of water'' is any significant accumulation of [[water]] on a geographical scale.  Some bodies of water can be man-made, but most are naturally occurring.  Some bodies of water collect and move water, such as rivers and streams, and others primarily hold water, such as lakes and oceans. Bodies of water that are [[navigation|navigable]] are known as [[waterways]].

A ''geographer'' is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Earth]]'s physical [[natural environment|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Geographers are historically known for making [[map]]s, the subdiscipline of geography known as [[cartography]].  But they are not only capable of studying the physical details of the environment but also its impact on human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. Geographers especially focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.
