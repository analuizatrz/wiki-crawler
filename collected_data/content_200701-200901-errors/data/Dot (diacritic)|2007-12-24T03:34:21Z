{{Diacritical marks}}
When used as a [[diacritic]] mark, the term '''dot''' is usually reserved for the ''[[Interpunct]]'' ( · ), or to the [[glyph]]s 'combining dot above' ( {{unicode|&nbsp;̇}} ) and 'combining dot below' ( {{unicode|&nbsp;̣}} ) which may be combined with some [[letter]]s of the extended [[Latin alphabet]]s in use in Central European languages and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

==Overdot==
{{Seealso|Anusvara}}

Language scripts or transcription schemes that use the dot above a letter as a diacritical mark:

* In [[Arabic romanization]], ''{{Semxlit|[[ġ]]}}'' stands for the letter ''[[ghayin]]''.
* [[Irish orthography#The alphabet|Traditional Irish typography]], where the dot denotes [[lenition]], and is called a {{lang|ga|''ponc séimhithe''}} or {{lang|ga|''buailte''}} "dot of lenition": ''{{Unicode|ḃ ċ ḋ ḟ ġ ṁ ṗ ṡ ṫ}}''. Alternatively, lenition may be represented by a following letter ''h'', thus: ''bh ch dh fh gh mh ph st th''. In [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] orthography, the dot was used only for ''{{Unicode|ḟ ṡ}}'', while the following ''h'' was used for ''ch ph th''; lenition of other letters was not indicated. Later the two systems spread to the entire set of lenitable consonants and competed with each other. Eventually the standard practice was to use the dot when writing in [[Gaelic script]] and the following ''h'' when writing in [[antiqua]]. Thus ''ċ'' and ''ch'' represent the same phonetic element in Modern Irish.
* [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: ''[[ė]]''
* [[Maltese language|Maltese]]: ''[[ċ]] [[ġ]] ż''
* [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''ż''
* The dot above lowercase ''[[i]]'' and ''[[j]]'' (and uppercase ''[[I-dot|İ]]'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) is not regarded as an independent diacritic, but rather as an integral part of the letter. It is called a [[tittle]].

The overdot is also used in the [[Devanagari script]], where it is called ''anusvara''.

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] the dot denotes the [[time derivative]] as in <math>v=\dot{x}</math>.

==Underdot==

* In [[IAST]] and [[National Library at Calcutta romanization]], transcribing [[Indic languages]], a dot below a letter indicates [[retroflex consonant]]s, while an underdot {{Semxlit|}} signifies an [[emphatic consonant]].

* In [[romanization]]s of [[Semitic languages]], a dot below a consonant is used to indicate [[emphatic consonant]]s. For example, ''{{unicode|ṣ}}'' represents an emphatic ''s''.
** ''{{Unicode|[[Ḍ]]}}''
** ''{{Unicode|[[Ṛ]]}}''
** ''{{Unicode|[[Ṣ]]}}''
** ''{{Unicode|[[Ṭ]]}}''
** ''{{Unicode|[[Ẓ]]}}''

*[[Asturian language|Asturian]] uses ''{{Unicode|[[Ḷ]][[ḷ]]}}'' for western [[Asturian language|Asturian]] transcriptions for the [[voiced retroflex plosive]]. [[Asturian language|Asturian]] also uses ''{{Unicode|[[Ḥ]]}}'' for the [[voiceless glottal fricative]].
* ''{{Unicode|[[Ḍ]]}}'' is also used in the [[O'odham language]].
* [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. The ''nặng'' [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] (low, glottal) is represented with a dot below the base vowel: ''ạ ặ ậ ẹ ệ ị ọ ộ ợ ụ ự ỵ''.
* In [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], the dot is used below the ''o'', the ''e'' and the ''s'': those three letters can also occur without dot as another letter.

The underdot is also used in the [[Devanagari script]], where it is called ''anunaasika''.
