[[Image:Galaga.png|frame|right|''[[Galaga]]'', a famous shoot-em-up by [[Namco]] from [[1981 in video gaming|1981]].]]

A '''shoot-'em-up''' (also known as '''shmup'''<ref>Buchanan, Levi, [http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/865/865346p1.html Top 10 Classic Shoot 'Em Ups], ''IGN'', April 8, 2008, May 26, 2008</ref>) is a [[video game genres|computer and video game genre]] of [[shooter game]] in which the player controls a vehicle or character and fights large numbers of enemies with shooting attacks. The style of the game may range from cute to serious, from fantasy and science fiction to historic settings.<ref>Buchanan, Levi, [http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/865/865346p1.html Top 10 Classic Shoot 'Em Ups], ''IGN'',  April 8, 2008, May 26, 2008</ref>

Shoot 'em ups originated in the [[arcade game|arcades]] with [[Space Invaders]] usually being credited with the genre's birth.<ref>Buchanan, Levi, [http://uk.wireless.ign.com/articles/391/391708p1.html Space Invaders], ''IGN'', March 31, 2003, Accessed June 14, 2008</ref> They peaked in popularity during the late 80s and early 90s, primarily as arcade and [[video game console|console]] titles. As the use of [[3D graphics]] became more common in video games, the simplicity and arcade sensibilities of the genre slowly relegated their popularity to that of a niche. The genre remains most alive in Japan.<ref>Staff, [http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/062/062968p1.html E3: Konami Goes Oldschool with Salamander], ''IGN'', June 19, 1997, Accessed June 14, 2008</ref><ref>Fahey, Rob, [http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=72589  Every Extend Extra], ''EuroGamer'', 7 February, 2007, Accessed 17 June, 2008</ref>

== Common elements ==

[[Image:rtypedoppelganger.png|frame|Dobkeratops, the first ''[[R-Type]]'' boss.]]

=== Enemies ===

In most shoot 'em ups, enemies appear in waves. Passing a level on the earliest shoot 'em ups usually required defeat or evasion of all enemies in that level. In later shoot 'em ups, levels began including [[boss (video games)|bosses and minibosses]] as key milestones for the player to overcome. More recently, the greater processing power associated with newer consoles have allowed levels with dozens of enemies and attacks at once.<ref>Fahey, Rob, [http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=72589  Every Extend Extra], ''EuroGamer'', 7 February, 2007, Accessed 17 June, 2008</ref>

=== Power-ups ===

[[Power-up]]s are an integral feature of most shoot 'em ups. They are enhancements for the player's character that can be gained during the course of the game, usually as a reward for destroying enemies. Power-ups can improve the player's speed, armor, firepower, or weapon direction and range. These power-ups may have a limited supply or duration. Power-ups vary from game to game.<ref>[http://www.binaryjoy.co.uk/games/review/alien-stars-review/ Alien Stars], ''Binary Joy'', September 1, 2006, AccessedJune 20, 2008</ref><ref>Beck, Ian, [http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=695&Page=1 Jets'n'Guns], ''Inside Mac Games'', May 19, 2006, Accessed July 20, 2008</ref>

=== Death ===

Many shoot 'em ups have elected to have one hit by an enemy result in instant death. As an additional penalty, the player may have to restart from an earlier level, or lose any special abilities they have gained. Other games use a [[hit point]] system that allows a player to take multiple hits before death.<ref>[http://www.binaryjoy.co.uk/games/review/alien-stars-review/ Alien Stars], ''Binary Joy'', September 1, 2006, AccessedJune 20, 2008</ref><ref>Beck, Ian, [http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=695&Page=1 Jets'n'Guns], ''Inside Mac Games'', May 19, 2006, Accessed July 20, 2008</ref>

=== Multiplayer ===

On occasion, shoot 'em ups feature simultaneous [[multiplayer]] gameplay, with both players playing on the same screen.<ref>Rea, Jared, [http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/07/todays-multi-directional-videos-everyday-shooter-and-mutant-stor/ Today's multi-directional videos: Everyday Shooter & Mutant Storm Empire], ''Joystiq'', August 7 2007, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref>

== Types ==
Shoot 'em ups are often categorized by the player's viewpoint and movement.

[[Image:Kingball.gif|thumb|right|[[King & Balloon]] is a fixed shooter. The player may only shoot straight up, and can only move from left to right.]]

=== Fixed shooters ===

''Fixed shooters'' consist of levels that can each fit within a single screen. The player's movement is usually fixed to a single axis of motion, and their ability to aim is usually fixed in one direction.<ref>Provo, Frank [http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/galaga90/review.html Galaga '90], ''GameSpot'', August 10, 2007, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref> These games are sometimes also called ''gallery shooters''.<ref>[http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/classes/cmps080k/Winter07/lectures/shmups.pdf Game Genres: Shmups], Professor Jim Whitehead, January 29, 2007, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref>

[[Image:Gradius 04.png|thumb|left|''[[Gradius]]'' is a scrolling shooter.]]

=== Scrolling shooters ===

In scrolling shooters, as the player explores each level, the screen scrolls to reveal more of the level and more enemies. Scrolling shooters may scroll horizontally or vertically: A horizontal scrolling shooter shows the player from a sideview, while a vertical scrolling shooter offers a top-down perspective.<ref>Provo, Frank [http://uk.gamespot.com/gbc/action/1942/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review 1942], ''GameSpot'', August 24, 2001, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref><ref>Navarro, Alex, [http://uk.gamespot.com/ds/action/contra4/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review Contra 4], ''GameSpot'', November 13, 2007, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref><ref>Watters, Chris, [http://uk.gamespot.com/ds/action/nanostray2/review.html Nanostray 2], ''GameSpot'', March 28, 2008, Accesed July17, 2008</ref>
[[Image:JAG Tempest 2000.png|thumb|left|''[[Tempest 2000]]'' is a tube shooter.]]

=== Tube and rail shooters ===

''Tube shooters'' give players a single axis of movement around the edge of an on-screen "tube", creating the illusion that the player is moving forward into the screen. This style originated with [[Atari]]'s ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'' and was further popularized by ''[[Gyruss]]''.<ref>Roper, Chris, [http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/829/829253p1.html The Games of Atari Classics Evolved: Part 2], ''IGN'', October 22, 2007, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref><ref>Surette, Tim, [http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/3dultraminigolf/news.html?sid=6169135 XBL Wednesdays: Gyruss, MiniGolf],''GameSpot'', April 16, 2007, Accessed July 17, 2008</ref>

''Rail shooters'' largely supplanted tube shooters with the rise of three dimensional gameplay. The player's viewpoint automatically turns and moves through the level as if player were attached to a [[railroad]], hence the name of the subgenre. As the player is propelled forward, the player may have limited freedom of motion to dodge incoming attacks. A few notable rail shooters include [[Panzer Dragoon]], [[Rez]], and ''[[Star Fox (SNES)|Star Fox]]''.<ref>Goldstein, Hilary, [http://uk.xbox.ign.com/articles/382/382195p1.html Panzer Dragoon Orta], ''IGN'', January 10, 2003, July 17, 2008</ref><ref>Staff, [http://uk.dreamcast.ign.com/articles/163/163276p1.html Godzilla Generations Maximum Impact (Import)], ''IGN'', January 10, 2000, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref><ref>Brudvig, Erik, [http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/846/846949p1.html Rez HD is Coming], ''IGN'', January 22, 2008, June 17, 2008</ref>

===Multidirectional shooter===

[[Image:Robotron: 2084.png|right|thumb| ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'' is a multidirectional shooter.]]

'''Multidirectional shooters''', also called '''arena shooters''', allow freedom of movement and orientation in a two-dimensional environment. This may take place within a single-screen level such as [[Robotron: 2084]], or allow players to navigate a larger playing field as the screen scrolls.<ref>Onyett, Charles, [http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/688/688334p1.html Crystal Quest], ''IGN'', February 13, 2006, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref><ref>Reverend Anthony, [http://www.destructoid.com/indie-nation-18-everyday-shooter-86257.phtml Indie Nation #18: Everyday Shooter], ''Destructoid'', May 16, 2008, Accessed July 20, 2008</ref>

Examples of multidirectional shooters include ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', ''[[Time Pilot]]'', ''[[Bosconian]]'', ''[[Smash TV]]''<ref>Rea, Jared, [http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/07/todays-multi-directional-videos-everyday-shooter-and-mutant-stor/ Today's multi-directional videos: Everyday Shooter & Mutant Storm Empire], ''Joystiq'', August 7 2007, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref>, ''[[Bangai-O]]''<ref>Harris, Craig, [http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/846/846525p1.html IGN DS Previews 2008], ''IGN'', January 18, 2008, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref>, ''[[Geometry Wars]]'',<ref>Rea, Jared, [http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/07/todays-multi-directional-videos-everyday-shooter-and-mutant-stor/ Today's multi-directional videos: Everyday Shooter & Mutant Storm Empire], ''Joystiq'', August 7 2007, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref> ''[[Everyday Shooter]]'', ''[[Sinistar]]'', ''[[Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf|Desert Strike]]'', ''[[Crimsonland]]'', ''[[Zone 66]]'', ''[[plobb!]]'' and ''[[Super Stardust HD]]''.

===Run and gun===
'''Run and gun''' usually describes shoot 'em ups where the player character runs on foot, often incorporating jumping, as seen in [[platform game]]s. Run and gun games can utilise side-scrolling, top-down or isometric viewpoints.<ref>Provo, Frank, [http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/bloodywolf/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review Bloody Wolf], ''GameSpot'', July 7, 2007, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref><ref>Dunham, Jeremy, [http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/533/533263p1.html First Look: Alien Hominid], ''IGN'', July 27, 2004, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref>

Examples of side-view run and guns include the [[Contra series|''Contra'' series]], [[Metal Slug series|''Metal Slug'' series]], ''[[Abuse (computer game)|Abuse]]'', ''[[Soldat]]'', ''[[Liero Xtreme]]'', ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]'' and ''[[Turrican]]'' (although the latter also has platform adventure elements and is generally less linear)

Examples of overhead view run and guns include ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'', ''[[Heavy Barrel]]'', ''[[Ninja Commando]]'', ''[[Jackal (video game)|Jackal]]'', and ''[[Guerrilla War (arcade game)|Guerrilla War]]''.

===Bullet hell===
{{nihongo|'''Bullet hell'''|弾幕|danmaku|lit. "bullet curtain"}} is a sub-genre of [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]]s in which the entire screen is often almost completely filled with enemy bullets.  The genre is also occasionally known as '''curtain fire'''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesradar.com/wii/castle-of-shikigami-iii/review/castle-of-shikigami-iii/a-20080617161311239012/g-2008041012538549048 | title = Review: Castle of Shikigami III | author = Eric Bratcher | publisher = GamesRadar | date = 2008-06-17 | accessdate = 2008-06-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18348 | title = Q&A: Capcom's Kujawa On Revisiting Classics, Bullet Hell | publisher = Gamasutra | author = Brandon Sheffield | date = 2008-04-22 | accessdate = 2008-06-30 }}</ref> Games in this genre are sometimes known as '''manic shooters'''.

This style of game originated in the mid-[[1990]]s, and can be seen as an evolution of [[scrolling shooter]]s.
Most of the well-known commercial games of this type are developed by the Japanese video game company [[Cave (company)|Cave]]. The genre is also very popular in [[dōjin soft]], particularly via the ''[[Touhou Project|Touhou]]'' series.

== History ==
===Early years===
The first shooter was called ''[[Spacewar!]],'' one of the very earliest computer games.<ref>Surette, Tim, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6152451.html?tag=result;title;0 Gaming pioneer passes away], ''GameSpot'', June 7, 2006, Accessed June 16, 2008</ref> However, it wasn't until 1978's seminal [[Space Invaders]] that the genre took off. ''Space Invaders'' is notable for pitting the player against many on-screen enemies that came from the top of the screen.<ref>Buchanan, Levi, [http://uk.wireless.ign.com/articles/391/391708p1.html Space Invaders], ''IGN'', March 31, 2003, Accessed June 14, 2008</ref> ''[[Space Invaders]]'' was also a massive commercial success, even causing a coin shortage in Japan.<ref>[http://www.science.ie/EN/index.cfm/section/news/news_key/520 Design your own Space Invaders], ''Science.ie'',4 Mar 2008, Accessed 17 June 2008</ref> It was quickly imitated, resulting in games such as ''Space Stranger''<ref>[http://uk.gamespot.com/arcade/action/superspacestranger/media.html Space Stranger], Accessed June 17, 2008</ref> and ''Super Invader Attack'',<ref>[http://uk.gamespot.com/arcade/action/superinvaderattack/index.html Super Invader Attack], Accessed June 17, 2008</ref>. Namco's ''[[Galaxian]]'' took the genre further with more complex enemy patterns, and richer graphics.<ref>Buchanan, Levi, [http://uk.wireless.ign.com/articles/394/394165p1.html Galaxian Mini], ''IGN'', April 21, 2003, Accessed June 17, 2008</ref>

1980's ''[[Defender (game)|Defender]]'' introduced a [[scrolling]] playfield to the shoot 'em up formula.<ref>[http://www.llamasoft.co.uk/lshistory8.php  The Dawn of Llamasoft], July 2006, Accessed July 21, 2008</ref> It offered horizontally extended levels. Unlike most later games in the genre, this scrolling could go in either direction, and followed the player. This would be imitated by some later shoot 'em ups, notably ''[[Choplifter]]'' and ''[[Fantasy Zone]]''. The following year, [[Konami]] introduced ''[[Scramble (arcade game)|Scramble]]'', a side scrolling shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling 'shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels, and laid the groundwork for ''[[Gradius]]''. Konami has since [[retconned]] ''Scramble'' into the ''Gradius'' series to acknowledge this influence.

Vertical scrolling shooters developed around the same time. While early titles like ''Galaxian'' offered scrolling star fields, they were merely superficial. [[Sega]]'s [[Borderline (game)|Borderline]](1981) was a vertical shooter with primitive scrolling. In March of the next year, [[Data East]] released ''Mission-X'' and ''Zoar'', the latter of which was licensed from Tago Electronics. Both games were very similar, with ''Zoar'' being the more developed of the two, with separate attacks for airborne and surface-based enemies. This same year Orca released ''Funky Bee'', which offered a more straightforward approach. These games would be overshadowed at the end of the year, when [[Namco]] released [[Xevious]], a title often credited with being the first vertically scrolling shooter.

1985 was a big year for shoot 'em ups, thanks to two major games. ''[[Tiger Heli]]'' was the first shooter from the developer [[Toaplan]], who would become an important name in the genre over the decade to follow. ''Tiger Heli'' is perhaps most notable for introducing the "megabomb," a powerful limited use weapon, and one of the genre's most popular conventions. This same year saw the release of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Gradius]]'', another major innovator. ''Gradius'' introduced selectable weapons, as well as "options," small offensive pods that follow and aid the player. These conventions, would be frequently imitated in later shooters.

The following year, [[Compile (software company)|Compile]] would release their first shoot 'em up, ''[[Zanac]]'', on the [[MSX]] computer and [[Famicom Disk System]] console. In the years to follow Compile would become one of the biggest developers of shoot 'em ups on consoles and computers. Sega also released ''[[Fantasy Zone]]'', this same year, on their new 16-bit arcade hardware. The title would become very popular in Japan, and it introduced Sega's mascot [[Opa-opa]]. Taito also released ''[[Darius (arcade game)|Darius]]'', the first in their flagship shooter series.

''[[R-Type]]'' was introduced in 1987. The brain child of [[Irem]], it became one of the major archetypes for side-scrolling shooters to follow, with vividly realized levels, and refined, methodical gameplay. Toaplan followed up ''[[Tiger Heli]]'' with ''[[Twin Cobra]]''. This title introduced a system with a wandering power-up that changed colors to represent different weapons. This convention would become a staple of their games, as well as those of others.

===Golden Age===
By this time the major conventions of the genre had been firmly established, and shoot 'em ups became  the most popular action genre for arcade games. This period lasted into the early and mid 90s and saw the release of many popular shooters, including ''[[Raiden]]'', a Toaplan-inspired game from [[Seibu Kaihatsu]], ''[[Gun Frontier (arcade game)|Gun Frontier]]'', and many sequels to ''[[Gradius]]'', ''[[R-Type]]'', and other popular series of the day.

Console and computer shooters became more common and were increasingly able to offer comparable experiences to their arcade counterparts. The [[PC Engine]] saw a whole slew of shooter titles released for it (in fact, PC Engine has by far the highest shooter/game ratio of any console in the postcrash gaming world) and the ''[[Thunder Force]]'' series brought arcade-style shooting to Japanese home computers and later the [[Sega Genesis]]. Games like ''[[Axelay]]'' and ''[[Bio-hazard Battle]]'' produced visuals and sounds worthy of their arcade contemporaries. 

During this period, shoot 'em ups did not evolve a great deal. The genre remained vital while reusing variations on the same gameplay ideas that had proven themselves. In the early 90s new genres began to emerge, and the market diversified. [[Fighting games]] reached new-found popularity in the arcades with the release of ''[[Street Fighter II]]''. Meanwhile, many console gamers were turning toward games that could provide longer playtime and in-depth narratives, and shoot 'em ups began to decline in popularity. In 1993, Compile shifted its focus away from shooters. In 1994, Toaplan closed its doors, and the genre lost one of its most devout supporters. For many this would serve as a signal that the Golden Age of shooters had ended.

===Evolution and renaissance===
[[Image:PCByukari140.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An example of bullet hell in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', a danmaku shooter.]]
The death of Toaplan would ultimately open more doors than it would close. Four companies would form from the ashes of Toaplan, and all remained even more devoted to the shooter genre than Toaplan. The first such company was [[Raizing]]. Raizing went as far as to continue to use Toaplan arcade hardware for their titles into the late 90s. Their first game was ''[[Mahou Daisakusen]]'', the first title in their flagship trilogy. 

The following year another company formed from ex-Toaplan staff. [[Cave (company)|Cave]] premiered with ''[[Donpachi]]'', a game which expanded on the design of Toaplan's final game ''[[Batsugun]]''. ''Batsugun'' is considered by many to be the starting point for a new breed of shoot 'em up. These games would come to be called "[[Bullet hell|danmaku]]" (lit. "bullet curtain") in Japan, and "manic" shooters in the West. These games are distinguished by high bullet counts, and a small collision zone (or "hit box") for the player.

Cave and Raizing would have something of a sibling rivalry. In 1996, Raizing released ''[[Battle Garegga]]'', an homage to Taito's classic ''[[Gun Frontier]]''. It pushed the manic style a level further, which, in turn, inspired Cave to put aside their reservations and produce the most manic shoot 'em up yet, ''[[Dodonpachi]]''. Cave continued to carry the Toaplan torch, embedding the message "Toaplan Forever" in the high score tables. Their next game, ''[[Dangun Feveron]]'', would be a [[pastiche]] to Toaplan as well, made to celebrate the tenth anniversary of ''[[Truxton]]''.

While their popularity was in decline, this was a creatively fertile time for the genre. In 1998 [[Treasure (company)|Treasure]] released their first arcade shoot 'em up, ''[[Radiant Silvergun]]''.

=== Possible rebirth of shmups ===

With the release of the Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360's Live Arcade, and the Playstation 3's PSN network, the shmup genre may have another rebirth. Many TurboGrafx 16 titles are being re-released on the Nintendo Wii. The Xbox 360 brought the mega-popular [[Geometry Wars]] to the platform. ''[[Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved]]'' has become the top selling game on the service, with over 185,000 purchases and downloads as of [[July 21]] [[2006]].<ref>[http://www.xboxic.com/news/1312 Xboxic » Fun and completely useless XBLA facts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Several Eugene Jarvis-created shooters are also available on the service, including enhanced versions of ''[[Smash TV]]'' and ''[[Robotron: 2084]]''. Also available is [[Ikaruga]] and most recently, [[Aces of the Galaxy]].
