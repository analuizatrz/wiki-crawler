Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.251)</ref> While continuing to make on-screen appearances, he was inactive from in-ring competition from 1998-2002 due to a legitimate severe back injury.<ref name="WWEProfile"/>

Before coming to WWE, Hickenbottom began his career in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] in 1984. He then went on to Texas All-Star Wrestling. He made his national debut with the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) in 1986. He signed with World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1987 while still under contract with the AWA. He returned to the AWA, only to go back to WWF in 1988.<ref name="WWEProfile"/>

==Career==
===Early career===
Hickenbottom was born on [[July 22]] [[1965]], in [[Chandler, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title= Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=12}}</ref> The last of four children - Randy, Scott and Shari. He was raised in a military family and spent a brief part of his early years in [[Reading, Berkshire]], [[England]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=12-13}}</ref> but grew up in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He knew he wanted to become a professional wrestler at the age of 12. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of 6 when he started playing [[American football|football]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=15|quote=Football played a big part in my childhood and teenage years}}</ref> He was a stand-out [[Linebacker]] at [[Randolph High School (Texas)|Randolph High School]] and eventually became Captain of the football team.<ref name="WWEProfile"/><ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.30)</ref> After graduating, Hickenbottom attended [[Texas State University–San Marcos|Southwest Texas State University]] in [[San Marcos, Texas]], but soon realized that college life was not for him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=43-49}}</ref> Then he began pursuing the career of a professional wrestler. 

He was then trained by [[Mexico|Mexican]] professional wrestler [[Jose Lothario]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=51-57|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> Lothario  suggested that Hickenbottom go by the ring name Shawn Michaels. After his training with Lothario, he debuted in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] in 1984 and later with Texas All-Star Wrestling (TAW) [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]].<ref name="HAT"/> During his time with TAW, Michaels and [[Paul Diamond]] were awarded the TAW Tag Team Championship by [[Chavo Guerrero|Chavo Guerrero, Sr.]]<ref name="S.C.W.

Hickenbottom also worked for [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=75-77|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> There, he and tag team partner [[Marty Jannetty]] defeated The Batten Twins for the [[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship|Central States Tag Team Championship]], later losing it back to the Battens.<ref name="N.W.A.

Central States Tag Team Title|accessdate=2007-07-15|publisher=Wrestling-Titles}}</ref> Hickenbottom also made several appearances in the [[Dallas, Texas]]-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] throughout 1985.

===American Wrestling Association (1986–1988) ===
Michaels made his national-level debut in 1986 for the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), once again teaming with [[Marty Jannetty]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=91-93|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> The pair was billed as "[[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]]" and won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] twice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/awa/awa-t.html|title=A.W.A. World Tag Team Titles|accessdate=2007-07-15|publisher=Wrestling-Titles}}</ref> They also appeared in the Mid-South on loan at this point. In a raid of AWA talent in 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=110-111|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> They were fired from the WWF two weeks later, however, for "partying too hard" (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography).<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=116-118|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> They then returned to the AWA, but were re-signed by the WWF a year later.<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=128-130|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref>

===World Wrestling Federation===
====1988–1991====
{{main|The Rockers}}
They redebuted for the World Wrestling Federation at a [[house show]] on [[July 7]] [[1988]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.133)</ref> Due to WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]]'s desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive monikers, they were repackaged as simply "[[The Rockers]]". The team proved popular with both children and women. The team was a mid-card stalwart of TV and [[pay-per-view]] shows for the next two years, but never seemed to get a chance at the WWF's Tag Team Championships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=148|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref>

Belatedly, in October 1990, their chance came when The Rockers were scheduled to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Hart Foundation]], as [[Jim Neidhart]], half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company.<ref name="OWOW">{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/shawn-michaels.html|title=Shawn Michaels Wrestling Profile|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=149|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> The match was taped with The Rockers [[List of professional wrestling slang#C|cleanly]] winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to a stopgap agreement with management and was rehired.<ref name="OWOW"/> The belts were returned to the Harts, while the title change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on TV.<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=149-150|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed [[turnbuckle]] in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broken, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match. The Rockers plodded along, eventually splitting on [[December 2]] [[1991]] during an incident on [[Edward Leslie|Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake's]] televised "Barber Shop" talk show segment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=157-159|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> Michaels [[superkick]]ed Jannetty and [[Defenestration|threw him]] through a [[Sugar glass|glass]] window on the "shop" set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1991|accessdate=2007-11-27|author=Graham Cawthon|quote=(shown January 12) featured the Rockers as guests of the Barber Shop in which they appeared to put their differences behind them only for Shawn Michaels to superkick Marty Jannetty before throwing him face-first through a plate glass window}}</ref> Jannetty vanished from the WWF and Michaels [[List of professional wrestling slang#T|turned]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] as "The Boy Toy".<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=159|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref>

====1992–1993====
At the suggestion of [[Curt Hennig|Curt "Mr. Perfect" Hennig]], Michaels' adopted the nickname "The Heartbreak Kid."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forever-shawn.net/info/facts.html|title=Forever Shawn >>> Fast Facts|accessdate=2007-07-26| publisher=Forever-Shawn.net}}</ref> Along with his new name came a new [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick]] as a vain, cocky heel. He was put together with mirror-carrying [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Sherri Martel|"Sensational" Sherri]], who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him.<ref name="sherri">{{cite book|last= Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=159| quote=When I returned to the States, I checked my phone messages.

They wanted to put her with me.}}</ref> Sherri even sang the first version of his new [[theme music]] "Sexy Boy."<ref name="HAT"/> During that period, Michaels normally wrestled during the first half of [[house shows]], and his departure was announced with the words "Shawn Michaels has left the building" (alluding to the phrase "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] has left the building").<ref>{{cite book|last= Michaels| first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=165-166| quote=One thing I did ask the office to do was have the announcers come over the P.A. and announce after I had wrestled, "Ladies and Gentlemen, Shawn Michaels has left the building." It was an obvious spoof of Elvis and I thought it would help me get heat from the fans who'd think, "Who the heck does this guy think he is?"}}</ref>

Michaels failed to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Bret Hart]] in July 1992, even losing the WWF's first ever [[Ladder match]] against him at a [[house show]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.161)</ref><ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.162)</ref> Still, Michaels was beginning to [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|get over]] as a heel. He won the Intercontinental Championship from [[Davey Boy Smith|"The British Bulldog"]] during ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[October 27]] [[1992]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/snme.html#31|title=Saturday Night's Main Event - October 27, 1992 results|accessdate=2007-09-28|publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, he was in a pay-per-view main event for the first time, facing — and losing to — future nemesis Bret Hart, for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at the [[Survivor Series (1992)|1992 Survivor Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=90-91}}</ref> They were moved to the main event after [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]] suddenly departed from the WWF, leaving his tag team match with [[Randy Savage]] against [[Ric Flair]] and [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] hanging.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Baer|first=Randy|coauthors=R.D. Reynolds|publisher=ECW Press|date=2003|isbn=1-55022-584-7|pages=74}}</ref>

Michaels and Sherri split at this point, and his former partner Jannetty quickly reappeared. Michaels lost the Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' on [[May 17]] [[1993]].<ref name=1993results>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1993.html|title=RAW 1993 Results|accessdate= 2007-07-23|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> He then regained it on [[June 6]] [[1993]] with the help of his debuting "[[bodyguard]]" (and off-air friend) [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]].<ref name=1993results/>

After a feud with Mr. Perfect, Michaels quit the WWF in September 1993. It was announced that Michaels had failed to defend his belt enough times during a set period; in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for [[steroid]]s — a charge that Michaels denies to this day.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.182)</ref> After turning down [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s advances, Michaels returned to the WWF and made several appearances in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television for November's [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view, substituting for the arrested [[Jerry Lawler]] in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's "Knights" against Bret, [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]], and [[Owen Hart]].<ref name=pwi92>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=91-92}}</ref>

====1994–1995====
[[Image:Hug MSG Incident.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Clique (professional wrestling)#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|The MSG Incident]].]]
He soon entered a feud with [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], who had won the vacated [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Title]] during Michaels' absence.<ref name="ladderbegin">{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=182-187|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt.<ref name="ladderbegin"/> This feud culminated in a [[ladder match]] between the two at [[WrestleMania X]].<ref name="ladderbegin"/> Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's belts suspended above a ladder in the ring.<ref name=pwi92/><ref name="ladderbegin"/>This match won "Match of the Year" awards from ''Pro Wrestling Illustrated'' and the ''[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''.<ref name="Match of the Year">{{cite web|url=http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/pwi/pwimoty.htm|title=Wrestling Information Archive - PWI Award Winners - Match of the Year|accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref> Over the next few months, Michaels battled various injuries and launched the "Heartbreak Hotel" TV talk show segment, mainly shown on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.190)</ref>

On [[August 28]] [[1994]], Michaels and his ever more popular sidekick, [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], captured the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Headshrinkers]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=195|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> During their brief time as a tag team, they used a variation of the Headshrinkers' finishing move, where Michaels finished off their opponent by climbing on Diesel's shoulders and [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|splashed]] their opponents. The next day, at [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam]], Diesel lost the Intercontinental Title to Ramon when Michaels accidentally [[Superkick]]ed his bodyguard.<ref name=pwi92/> This triggered a Michaels-Diesel split, a storyline that was drawn out until the [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]] that November due to Michaels' hand injury.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards| publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=92-93}}</ref> Michaels went on to win the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|1995 Royal Rumble]], where he was the first participant to win the Rumble match from the No.1 spot.<ref name=WWEhistory/><ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|pages=197-199|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> This set up a championship grudge match at [[WrestleMania XI]] against Diesel (who had gone on to win the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] from [[Bob Backland]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=196|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited [[Sid Eudy|Sid]] as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match,<ref>{{cite news|author=Martin, Finn| title=Power Slam Magazine, issue 10|work=Tough luck Shawn (WrestleMania XI)|publisher=SW Publishing|date=1995-04-24|pages=20-25}}</ref> and was attacked by Sid the following night.<ref name="Sid attack">{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=204|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> After this, Michaels took time off.<ref name="Sid attack"/>

He returned to the ring as a '[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]' in June 1995 and defeated [[Jeff Jarrett]] at July's [[In Your House#In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks|In Your House]] pay-per-view to win his third Intercontinental title.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/iyh.html#2|title=In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks|accessdate=2007-12-28| publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=209|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]], in a Ladder match, which Michaels won.<ref>{{cite news|author=Martin, Finn|title=Power Slam Magazine, issue 15| work=Feel the Heat (Summer Slam 1995)|publisher=SW Publishing|date=1995-09-25|pages=18-19}}</ref> Around this time, Michaels became the alleged leader of a backstage group known as [[Clique (professional wrestling)|The Clique]]. Others perceived the group to have sufficient clout with WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], becoming dominant wrestling figures in WWF for several years in the mid-1990s.

The next month, during a match with [[Owen Hart]] on an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Owen nailed Michaels with an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|Enzuigiri]] kick to the back of Michaels' head.<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=215|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> They continued to wrestle, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion in the Syracuse incident.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1995.html|title=RAW 1995 Results|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> The concussion was a [[Work (professional wrestling)|work]], skillfully kept from most fans at the time.<ref name="HAT"/>

'''Entrance music'''
*The song ''Sexy Boy'' was originally written for Michaels by [[Jimmy Hart]]. Hart thanked Michaels personally for continuing to use the song as his entrance music when he was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2005. Michaels' entrance music was originally performed by [[Sherri Martel]] until she became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]],<ref name="HAT"/> and then the second version was performed by Michaels himself with traces of Sherri in the chorus portion of the song. The current version of the song in use today is the version Michaels sung himself.
*Since the return of [[D-Generation X]], Michaels mostly used the DX entrance ''Break It Down,'' by [[Chris Warren (musician)|The Chris Warren Band]], even when wrestling in singles competition, but then went back to using ''Sexy Boy''.

==Personal life==
Growing up, Hickenbottom was never called "Michael" because he hated the name, so his family and friends just called him "Shawn".<ref>{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=19|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> Ever since, he has been referred to as Shawn. Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently since his father was in the military. He relates in his autobiography how he dreaded the first day at his many new schools, when the teacher would call roll and announce his surname of "Hickenbottom" to the class, which would evoke giggles and teasing because of its unusual sound.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.18)</ref>

In 1996, Hickenbottom posed in a non-nude layout for ''[[Playgirl]]'' [[magazine]].<ref name="playgirl">{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=233|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> It was not until after he posed that he discovered that ''Playgirl'' has a mostly homosexual readership, which was seen as humorous by his fellow wrestlers.<ref name="playgirl"/>

Hickenbottom's marriage to his first wife, Theresa Lynn Wood, was brief and ended in divorce, but was amicably settled.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.194)</ref> He is now married to former WCW [[Nitro Girls|Nitro Girl]], [[Rebecca Curci|Whisper (Rebecca Curci)]]. They were married on [[March 31]] [[1999]] at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.296)</ref> It was a very small wedding ceremony. The only people present were Hickenbottom, Rebecca Curci, and an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] impersonator. Hickenbottom and Curci have a son, Cameron Kade (born on [[January 5]] [[2000]])<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.304)</ref> and a daughter, Cheyenne Michelle (born on [[August 19]] [[2004]]).<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.329)</ref>

Hickenbottom has several tattoos. He has a tattoo of a heart with a sword through it with what appears to be a snake around it in the shape of an "S".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/shawnmichaels/photos1/2007rawphotos/020507hbk2.jpg|title=An image of HBK|accessdate=2007-11-27|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> He has one on his wedding finger, that has an ''R'' for his wife Rebecca. Another in his left wrist, it's a bracelet design that says "Cameron" for his son.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/shawnmichaels/photos1/outsidetheringphotos/|title=An image of HBK|accessdate=2007-11-27| publisher=WWE}}</ref> On his left leg he has a picture of his wife,<ref name="tattoo">{{cite video|year=2003|title=Before They Were WWE Superstars 2|medium=DVD|publisher=WWE Home Video}}</ref> the other leg has a picture of the state of Texas.<ref name="tattoo"/> Finally, he has a small broken heart with the letters "HBK" above it, tattooed on his right hip.<ref>{{cite video|year=2007|title=The New and Improved DX|medium=DVD|publisher=WWE Home Video}}</ref>

Hickenbottom is [[cross-dominance|ambidextrous]].<ref name="ambidextrous">{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Shawn|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|publisher=WWE Books|date=November 2005|page=15|isbn=978-1-4165-2645-2}}</ref> This caused him problems as a boy playing football, as he had trouble differentiating between his right and left directions.<ref name="ambidextrous"> He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write.<ref name="ambidextrous"> He typically uses his right leg to deliver Sweet Chin Music.

Hickenbottom is a [[Born again Christianity|born again Christian]]. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, but became a non-denominational Christian under the influence of his wife Rebecca. His ring attire often incorporates cross symbols, and while on the way to the ring, he normally gets down on his knees and mouths a prayer while his pyrotechnics go off. He has been seen in the congregation during a televised service of [[Cornerstone Church]] in his hometown of San Antonio. Hickenbottom is a [[Bible]] teacher in San Antonio.<ref name="HAT"/> Hickenbottom also appeared on a [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] program along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/shawn-michaels.html|title=Shawn Michael's Online World of Wrestling profile|accessdate=2007-09-02|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://tbn.org/index.php/9/4/2408.html|title=TBN search results|accessdate=2007-09-02|publisher=TBN.org}}</ref>

Hickenbottom is a fan of the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. He has been seen wearing Spurs merchandise and attending Spurs games. [[John Layfield|JBL]] made a reference to Hickenbottom being a season ticket holder during the [[Royal Rumble (2007)|2007 Royal Rumble]].<ref>{{cite video|year=2007|title=Royal Rumble 2007|medium=DVD|publisher=WWE Home Video}}</ref>
