'''''The Daily Show''''' (currently '''''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''''') is a [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and [[Emmy Award]]-winning half-hour [[United States|American]] satiric [[news]] [[television program]] produced by and run on the [[Comedy Central]] [[cable television]] network.  The show premiered on Monday, [[July 22]], [[1996]], and was hosted by [[Craig Kilborn]], who acted as an [[anchorman]].  In 1998, Kilborn left the show and was replaced by [[Jon Stewart]] in early 1999. 

Providing news-related comedy in the tradition of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s "[[Weekend Update (sketch)|Weekend Update]]" segment, [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Eleven O'Clock Show]]'', the BBC's "[[The Day Today]]," and the long-running [[Canada|Canadian]] series ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'', ''The Daily Show'' reports on the foibles and [[hypocrisy]] of the real world with a satirical edge. Since [[Jon Stewart]]'s entrance, the show has also developed a reputation as one of the sharpest [[politics|political]] commentary shows on American television. Due to Stewart's [[American_liberalism|liberal]] leanings, the show has been accused of having a [[liberal bias]], but this claim has been disputed by Stewart.

==Current format==
[[Image:Dailyshow a.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Jon Stewart mocking President [[George W. Bush]]]]
The show's format has remained relatively stable throughout the years. Each episode opens with the introduction, "From Comedy Central's World News Headquarters in New York, this is ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''."  This used to be followed by the statement "The most important television news show...ever", but this was eliminated from the introduction following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] when the show resumed on Thursday, [[September 20]]. The show was also previously credited in the introduction as the place "where more Americans get their news... than any other nationality". The show's format generally begins with the host's [[monologue]] of news headlines. ''The Daily Show'' runs this portion for the first segment, and may include "on location" reports. However, the correspondents are usually just standing in the studio with an obviously [[Bluescreen|greenscreen]]ed backdrop. While generally no note is made of this fact, it is occasionally the subject of jokes, such as having a correspondent report from a press base on [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] (this joke was used when the first [[Mars Exploration Rover]] landed), or from [[San Andreas]] of the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''. Once, this was parodied when two correspondents filed consecutive "live reports" from Washington: one during the day and the other suddenly during the night. On another occasion, two reporters, supposedly in distant cities and reporting simultaneously, broke the fourth wall when one became cold and the other threw her his coat, which the first caught.  A few reports are actually done on location; for example, Jason Jones was actually in Denmark for a [[March 28]], [[2006]] report, which he proved by shoving the person behind him (an uncredited passerby). Introductions and on-screen graphics always label the same four reporters as "senior" specialists in the subject at hand, sometimes with absurdly specific expertise. A given reporter may be "Senior Palestinian Analyst" one day, "Senior Agricultural Reporter" a few days later, "Senior Papal Vacancy Expert" the next week, and for the [[2005 trial of Michael Jackson]], "Senior Jackologist" then "Senior [[Child molestation|Child Molestation]] Expert". The show formerly split the news into segments known as "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Headlines|Headlines]]", "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Other News|Other News]]", and "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#This Just In|This Just In]]", though these titles were dropped sometime around 2003. Stewart and company have fine-tuned the technique of intercutting commentary with footage, in which the host or correspondent can stop the action at a telling moment, and register skeptical reserve or excruciated dismay, as political [[cliché]]s, dud imagery, or self-contradictory statements hang in the air.

Following the regular news portion are correspondent pieces and interviews, the order of which varies from episode to episode. Correspondent pieces involve the show's members actually traveling to a different location to make a report or interview people important to the story. Topics vary widely, ranging from the invention of [[hufu]], a tofu-based human flesh substitute, to a piece highlighting the lack of Asian men in [[pornography]]. Local media have reported on visits from ''Daily Show'' correspondents.<ref>{{cite news

Some segments occur periodically, such as "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Mark Your Calendar|Mark Your Calendar]]", "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Back in Black with Lewis Black|Back in Black]]" with [[Lewis Black]], "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#This Week in God|This Week in God]]", "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Trendspotting|Trendspotting]]" with [[Demetri Martin]], "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Poll Smoking|Poll Smoking]]" with [[Dave Gorman]], "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Great Moments in Punditry As Read By Children|Great Moments in Punditry as Read by Children]]" (small children reading transcripts of contentious moments from programs like ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' and ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]''), and "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#What Are We Doing To Pigs|What Are We Doing To Pigs]] (usually a random news article involving pigs).  Since the early days of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], a common part of the show has been "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Mess O' Potamia|Mess O' Potamia]]", focusing on the troubles in the Middle East, especially Iraq.

=== Studio ===
The program begins with a deep/low voice saying that day's date (if it is a repeat, the date will not be said) and "from Comedy Central's world news headquarters in [[New York City|New York]] this is the Daily Show with Jon Stewart" (as this is announced in the opening of each show), where Stewart is seen sitting at his desk on an elevated island stage in a "[[theatre in the round]]" type studio. On [[July 11]], [[2005]], the show moved its "World News Headquarters" to [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan]]  at 733 11th Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets.  The set changed along with the move, gaining a sleeker, more formal look, including a backdrop of three large LCD television panels which at first was not well-received by many fans of the show. The set change immediately spawned a backlash among fans and served as impetus for a [http://www.bringbackthecouch.com campaign to "Bring Back the Couch"] as it was not a part of the new set. The campaign was subsequently mentioned on the show by Stewart and [[Media:PSA-BAW.jpg|supported]] by ''Daily Show'' contributor [[Bob Wiltfong]]. The couch was eventually made the prize in a ''Daily Show '' sweepstakes in which the winner got the couch, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show and a small sum of money. Their old studio is now used for ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', a [[spin-off]] of the ''Daily Show'' starring former correspondent [[Stephen Colbert]].

===Production===
According to an [[October 7]], [[2003]], ''[[USA Today]]'' article, the show is pulled together by researchers scanning major newspapers, the [[Associated Press]] and [[cable television|cable]] news channels. Then, they give possible topics to the ten writers. The writers meet to discuss headline material for the lead news segment. By 11:15&nbsp;AM they meet with Jon Stewart, and by 12:30&nbsp;PM they have come up with jokes for the day's show.

''The Daily Show'' tapes four new episodes a week, Monday through Thursday. Taping of the program begins in front of the audience at 6:30&nbsp;PM; the show is then broadcast at 11&nbsp;PM [[Eastern Standard Time Zone|Eastern]]/10&nbsp;PM [[Central Standard Time Zone|Central]], a time when local television stations show their real news reports and about half an hour before most other late-night comedy programs begin to go on the air.

While the studio capacity is limited, tickets to attend tapings are free and can be obtained if requested far enough in advance.

==History==
===With Craig Kilborn (1996–1998)===
''The Daily Show'' was created by [[Lizz Winstead]] and [[Madeline Smithberg]]. Searching for a weeknight staple to replace ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' (a Comedy Central program that moved to ABC), Comedy Central premiered ''The Daily Show'' in the summer of 1996. A fake news program originally hosted by [[Craig Kilborn]], the show featured a humorous take on contemporary news events. Aimed to parody conventional newscasts, the show featured a comedic monologue of the day's headlines, mockumentary styled on-location reports, in-studio segments, guest commentary, and debates.  The show also took advantage of its visual medium, littering episodes with small touches like in-screen images labeled with their own gags, and presenting absurd bits of trivia coming back and going into commercials. Such segments included: "This Day in [[David Hasselhoff|Hasselhoff]] History", "Last Weekend's Top-Grossing Films, Converted into [[Lira]]", and "Trivial Compromise" in which Winstead's mother, Ginny, would ask and answer various trivia questions. Originally the show was done without a studio audience, and would just prompt the laughs of its own off-camera staff members. A studio audience was incorporated into the show for its second season, and has remained since.

Under Winstead and Kilborn the show had a much more relaxed atmosphere, with not all contributors wearing suits. Kilborn often made personal asides to the audience taking on the character of an "enlightened [[frat boy]]". Kilborn would also often dance for the audience, especially on Thursdays as a celebration of the end of the week. In each show Kilborn would conduct very informal celebrity interviews that would end with a segment called "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Five Questions|Five Questions]]" in which Kilborn would ask a sequence of five questions that often had irrelevant answers. The routine was derived from a [[pick-up line]] of Kilborn's invention, which Winstead thought would make good material for the show. 

Regular correspondents included [[Brian Unger]], [[Beth Littleford]], and [[A. Whitney Brown]]. [[Stephen Colbert]] joined the cast a year after it premiered and was referred to as "The New Guy" for the remainder of Kilborn's three year tenure. Lizz Winstead herself also acted as a contributor as well as a writer in a weekly spot called "He Said, Winstead" in which she and Kilborn would ad lib a point-counterpoint style argument. 

Each show was capped off with a segment called "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Your Moment of Zen|Your Moment of Zen]]" that often showed random video clips of humorous and sometimes morbid interest such as a [[snake charmer]] pulling a snake out of his throat via his nostril. A controversy arose due to one clip in which Asian men and women were shown throwing live baby chicks at alligators as feed. Winstead reacted to complaints by creating a similar video in which she threw fake chicks into a pond from a row boat.

Tensions often flared behind the scenes between Kilborn and female cast, leading Beth Littleford (a once-crew-leading member of the Daily Show) to comment later that Kilborn was as "dumb as a post". In a 1997 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine interview, Kilborn made sexually explicit comments about his female coworkers. This led to a two week suspension without pay. Co-creator Winstead quit one month later.

In 1998 Kilborn left ''The Daily Show'' in order to replace [[Tom Snyder]] on CBS's ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]''. He was able to take the interview segment "Five Questions" and for a brief period, his "Moment for Us" segment with him to the new show, disallowing any new ''TDS'' hosts from using it in their interviews. Correspondents Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown left the show shortly before him. Unger returned for a single show in which he was supposedly killed on assignment by an incoming cruise missile.

Kilborn's last new show was aired on [[December 17]], [[1998]]. Reruns were shown until Jon Stewart's debut 4 weeks later.

A book released by Comedy Central titled ''The Daily Show: Five Questions'' (ISBN 0-8362-5325-6) was released in 1998, and highlights many of the best interview moments from [[Craig Kilborn]]'s stint as host.

===With Jon Stewart (1999–present)===
[[Image:Jon_Stewart_in_2000_and_2005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stewart on ''The Daily Show'', in bewilderment at the difference between himself in 2000 and in 2005.]]

[[Jon Stewart]] took over as host on Monday, [[January 11]], [[1999]]. Stewart had previously hosted two shows on [[MTV]] (''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'' and an [[eponym|eponymous]] [[The Jon Stewart Show|talk show]]), as well as a syndicated late-night talk show, and had been cast in films and television.  His first guest was ''[[Spin City]]'''s [[Michael J. Fox]], who quipped, "I've been on this show more than you have!"

Unlike Kilborn, whose dialogue and character were written entirely by others, Stewart served not only as host but also as a writer and co-executive producer of the series. His influence is noted for heading a significant shift in the way the show handled news. Stewart had a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. This satirical edge, combined with the show's [[US Election 2000|2000 Election]] coverage, presciently dubbed "[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2000|Indecision 2000]]", helped to catapult Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' to new levels of popularity and critical respect. With Stewart on board, the show has won nine [[Emmy Award]]s and two [[Peabody Award]]s, and its ratings more than doubled according to a [[2003]] [[Newsweek]] article. By 2004, the show had emerged into a pop culture hit and one of the most popular programs on [[cable television]].  

Stewart took over hosting from Kilborn retaining much of the same staff and on-air talent, allowing many pieces to transition without much trouble, while other features like "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#God Stuff|God Stuff]]", with [[Joe Bob Briggs|John Bloom]] presenting an assortment of actual clips from various televangelists, and "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Backfire|Backfire]]", an in-studio debate between Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown, evolved into the similar pieces of [[Stephen Colbert]]'s "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#This Week in God|This Week in God]]" and Colbert and [[Steve Carell]]'s "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Even Stevphen|Even Stevphen]]". Since the change, a number of new features have been, and continue to be, developed as well. The ending segment "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#A Moment of Zen|A Moment of Zen]]" developed from a random selection of humorous videos to often being recaps or extended versions of news clips shown earlier in the show (though sometimes are completely unrelated to any previous segment). The show's theme music, "Dog on Fire" by [[Bob Mould]], was re-recorded by [[They Might Be Giants]].

==Interviews and guests==

{{main|List of The Daily Show guests}}

In addition to news stories, ''The Daily Show'' includes interviews with [[celebrity|celebrities]] of various degrees of notoriety and fame, authors, musicians, and political figures. The political interviews have featured many prominent guests such as:
* [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] [[Jimmy Carter]] & [[Bill Clinton]]. 
* [[United States Vice President|U.S. Vice President]] [[Al Gore]].
* [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretaries of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]], [[James Baker]] & [[Colin Powell]].
* [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]].
* [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]].
*[[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] [[Barbara Boxer]], [[Lincoln Chafee]], [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]], [[Tom Daschle]], [[Bob Dole]], [[John Edwards]] (who in 2003 announced his candidacy for the presidency on the show), [[Russ Feingold]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[John Kerry]], [[Joe Lieberman]], [[Trent Lott]], [[Joe Biden]], [[John McCain]], [[Zell Miller]], [[Barack Obama]] & [[Rick Santorum]].
* [[Democratic National Committee|DNC]] Chairmen [[Howard Dean]] & [[Terry McAuliffe]] and [[Republican National Committee|RNC]] Chairmen [[Ed Gillespie]] & [[Ken Mehlman]].
* [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Directors]] [[George Tenet]] & [[James Woolsey]].
* [[Pakistan|Pakistani]] President [[Pervez Musharraf]].
* Former United States Ambassador to the [[UN]] [[John R. Bolton]].

Musharraf is the only sitting head of state to appear on ''The Daily Show''.

When former correspondent [[Steve Carell]] appeared on the show as a guest, Stewart asked him if he had a report to file (after a minute of awkward silence), to which Carell responded in a deadpan joke, "I don't file reports anymore," before adding (as part of the joke) patronisingly, "I do movies."

Through Kilborn's run and the early years of Stewart's, the celebrity interviews would most often take place midway through the program. In recent years this has changed to the interviews being placed near the end of the show. Recent years have also seen the show's guest list tend away from celebrities and more towards non-fiction book authors and various political pundits, as well as many prominent elected officials.

On [[December 1]], [[2005]], the [[White Stripes]] became the first musical guests to perform on a regular episode of the show. After a brief interview with Stewart, the duo performed their songs "The Denial Twist" and later, "My Doorbell." In a press release, Stewart said, "We've never had a musical performance on the show before — not because we haven't wanted one — but because we were holding out for a reunited [[Spandau Ballet]]. This will have to suffice."  [[They Might Be Giants]]'s appearance on the [[December 15]], [[1999]] special "The Greatest Millennium" where they performed the theme (Bob Mould's "Dog On Fire"), incidental music, and their song "I Can Hear You" is not counted, as the producers do not consider it to be a part of the regular series. Another "unofficial" performance came on [[September 29]],[[2003]], when [[Tenacious D]] played from the couch. Most recently, the [[November 28]], [[2006]] show—also Stewart’s birthday—featured a live performance by guest [[Tom Waits]], who played his song "Day After Tomorrow" during the closing credits.

When Stephen Colbert started his own show, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', which airs immediately after ''The Daily Show'', Stewart began ending his show "checking in" with Stephen Colbert, usually exchanging notes on each other's shows, which is then followed by the Moment of Zen. On [[August 8]], [[2006]], Stephen Colbert turned the tables and "checked in" with Jon Stewart as Stewart was leaving to go home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdnirvana.org/2006/08/10/the-colbert-report-20060808-toss-to-jon-stewart/|title=The Colbert Report - 2006.08.08 - Toss to Jon Stewart|date=2006-08-10|accessdate=2006-09-09|work=[http://nerdnirvana.org/ sangent games and jokes]}}</ref> On [[August 10]], [[2006]], Stephen Colbert reappeared on the set of ''The Daily Show'' to demand that Jon apologize to [[Geraldo Rivera]] who on [[The O'Reilly Factor]], said that Stewart and Colbert "counted for nothing" and showed "clips of old ladies slipping on ice" for humor. Colbert, in character, condemned ''The Daily Show'' for angering Rivera.  When Stewart refused to apologize, Colbert proclaimed him "On Notice", though Jon averted the crisis by appearing on ''The Colbert Report'' the following Monday and apologizing (after "walking a mile in Geraldo's shoes" by wearing his moustache).
     
On [[September 13]], [[2006]], a new portion of the interview segment began called "[[Hot seat|The Seat of Heat]]", wherein the host would ask a guest one hard question to be answered.  On [[September 18]], [[2006]], for example, former United States President [[Bill Clinton]] was asked how [[Hillary Clinton]] could be defeated, should she run for President. The segment was apparently discontinued on [[November 27]], [[2006]].

==As a news source==
[[image:DailyShowClinton.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Bill Clinton]] on ''The Daily Show'']]
[[Nielsen Ratings|Television ratings]] show that the program generally has 1.4 million viewers nightly,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wired.com/wired/archive/13.09/stewart.html|title=Reinventing Television|publisher=Wired|year=2005|month=September|accessdate=2006-09-09}}</ref> a high figure for cable television. In [[demographics|demographic]] terms, the viewership is skewed to a relatively young audience compared to traditional news shows. A 2004 [[Nielsen Media Research]] study commissioned by Comedy Central put the median age at 35. In fact, during the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]], the show received more male viewers in the 18-34 year old age demographic than ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[Meet the Press]]'', ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' and all of the evening news broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web

The show's writers often repeat the fact that ''The Daily Show'' is a comedy program and not a reliable news source by itself. The show does not follow normal rules of journalistic integrity, but much of the [[schtick]] of the program involves questioning whether [[establishment]] television news sources in the United States, notably the cable news channels [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], and [[Fox News Channel]], are holding themselves to high journalistic standards. Likewise the show is far more likely to point out acts of [[Government failure|government ineptitude]] (such as a Senator doing a crossword puzzle during a relatively important hearing), hypocrisy and contradictory statements than most sources in the legitimate media. 

''The [[Washington Post]]'' ran an article on [[August 24]], [[2004]] in which it quoted ''[[Nightline]]'' anchor [[Ted Koppel]], who said to his viewers in a telecast from the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Boston]]: "A lot of television viewers &mdash; more, quite frankly, than I'm comfortable with &mdash; get their news from the Comedy Channel on a program called ''The Daily Show''." Stewart took issue with Koppel's comment, saying ''Daily Show'' fans watch "for comedic interpretation" of the news. "[They watch] to be informed", Koppel replied, refusing to budge from his position: "They actually think they're coming closer to the truth with your show." Stewart shot back: "Now that's a different thing, that's credibility, that's a different animal." Appearing on each other's shows a few weeks later, Koppel and Stewart downplayed the idea that the two had any mutual animosity. Also, in ''[[America (The Book)]]'', written by the staff of the Daily Show, Ted Koppel was one of only two political interviewers that the authors deemed credible (the other was [[Tim Russert]]).

[[Image:Kerry on the Daily Show.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[John Kerry]] on ''The Daily Show'']]
The [[Annenberg Public Policy Center|National Annenberg Election Survey]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] ran a study of American television viewers around the same time and found that fans of ''The Daily Show'' had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] than most others.<ref>National Annenberg Election Survey, ''[http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf Daily Show viewers knowledgeable about presidential campaign, National Annenberg Election Survey shows]'', press release, [[September 21]], [[2004]]. PDF file.</ref> The study primarily focused on comparing the audiences of ''TDS'' with that of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'', but ''Daily Show'' viewers also beat out people who primarily got their news through the national evening newscasts of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[NBC]] and those who mostly read newspapers, while roughly matching the knowledge level of viewers who watched a considerable amount of [[cable TV]] news. The study attempted to compensate for the fact that many viewers of ''TDS'' get information from many sources, including the [[Internet]]. 

The National Annenberg Election Survey is contradictory to a survey by Pew Research Center, however.  According to Pew Research Center on their 2004 campaign survey, those who cited comedy shows as a source for news were among the least informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates' backgrounds while those who cited the internet, National Public Radio, and news magazines were the most informed.  People who cited newspapers, public news TV shows, and talk radio were also nearly as knowledgeable as people who used the internet as a source.  Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the internet were still the most informed, while the those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=200|title=Cable and Internet Loom Large in Fragmented Political News Universe|publisher=Pew| accessdate = 2006-10-24}}</ref>

In 2006, a study published by [[Indiana University]] tried to compare the substantive amount of information of the Daily Show against primetime network news broadcasts. Julia R. Fox, an assistant professor of telecommunications at the university, showed in her study, "No Joke: A Comparison of Substance in The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and Broadcast Network Television Coverage of the 2004 Presidential Election Campaign"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=52300|title=No joke! 'Daily Show' substantive as network news|publisher=WorldNetDaily|accessdate = 2006-10-24}}</ref> (to be published in the summer of 2007), that when it comes to substance, there is little difference between the Daily Show and other news outlets. By using coverage and footage of the [[2004 Presidential Election]], she analyzes and compares both communication media. What she found was that neither actually offers more, since both programs are more focused on the nature of "[[infotainment]]" and ratings, making them both "equal" in content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.php?id=38119&adid=campus|title='Daily Show' news equal to networks' |publisher=idsnews.com|year=2006|month=October}}</ref> The analysis indicates that the Daily Show offered more humor than substance in their coverage, but that same study also found that the typical network coverage preferred to offer more hype than any real political substance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/4159.html|title=It's no joke: IU study finds The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to be as substantive as network news|publisher=Indiana University Media Relations|accessmonthday = [[October 24]] | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The study seems to indicate that either the Daily Show has become a legitimate 'news source' or the mainstream media has ceased to be one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatnewsnetwork.org/index.php/news/article/the_daily_show_is_as_substantive_as_the_real_news/?source=rss|title=The Daily Show is as substantive as the “real” news |publisher=greatnewsnetwork|accessdate = 2006-10-24}}</ref> Julia Fox states that ''"In an absolute sense, we should probably be concerned about both of those sources, because neither one is particularly substantive. It's a bottom-line industry and ratings-driven. We live in an 'infotainment' society, and there certainly are a number of other sources available."'' According to Fox, the study was less of an endorsement for the Daily Show; rather instead was meant to indict the negligence of news networks for their failure to uphold high standards in their political coverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2006/10/17/News/No.Laughing.Matter-2370755-page2.shtml?norewrite200610180412&sourcedomain=www.dailyemerald.com|title=No laughing matter: A recent study found that 'The Daily Show' has as much substance as traditional news programs|publisher=DailyEmerald| accessdate = 2006-10-24}}</ref>

Stewart was half-facetiously floated as a possible successor to [[Dan Rather]] of ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' according to ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' (this is partly due to the fact that, at the time, Comedy Central and CBS were both owned by media conglomerate [[Viacom]]).
[[Image:Whittingtonhamilton.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jon Stewart]] compares the [[Dick Cheney shooting incident]] to the [[Hamilton-Burr duel]] on ''The Daily Show'']]
The ''Daily Show'' writers authored a best-selling text, ''[[America (The Book)]]'', published in September 2004. It remained a bestseller even after the election, despite a decision by [[Wal-Mart]] to cancel its order because Chapter 5, on the [[judiciary|Judicial Branch]], includes obviously doctored photographs of the then current [[Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justices]], with their heads superimposed on appropriately aged naked bodies. On the page opposite the photographs, the reader is invited to "restore their dignity" by covering each justice with a cutout of his or her robe. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman was quoted in [[USA Today]] as saying, "We felt a majority of our customers would not be comfortable with the image."  The book was also banned from some [[Mississippi]] [[public library|public libraries]] for its ribald "centerfold". (The ban was lifted within 24 hours of its announcement after the library board received complaints.)  Stewart responded to this on air by saying, "Of course the go-to joke here would be, 'They have libraries in Mississippi?' But we're not going there."

Stewart, along with Stephen Colbert, was featured on the [[November 16]], [[2006]] cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Magazine, being called one of "America's anchors."<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors</ref>

==Criticism==
===Liberal bias===
Some perceive that ''The Daily Show'' has a [[liberal bias]], and that Stewart gives special critical attention to [[Conservatism_in_the_United_States|conservative]] figures. While this was also brought up and addressed by Stewart in the famous ''Crossfire'' interview (see below), the perception has continued. [[Joel Surnow]], creator of [[The 1/2 Hour News Hour]], described his show as a "The Daily Show for conservatives," implying ''The Daily Show'' panders to a [[American_liberalism|liberal]] audience. He went on to say, "You can turn on any show and see Bush being bashed." [http://www.forbes.com/digitalentertainment/2006/11/20/foxnews-conservative-satire-tech-media-cx_1120varietytv.html]

=== Interviews ===
While ''The Daily Show'' is considered by its creators to be a "fake news program", critics have said that current host Jon Stewart regularly has as guests the very politicians and newspeople he often lampoons, but rarely takes them to task face-to-face; instead, politicians on all sides of the spectrum use the show as a platform to reach younger demographics. Show co-creator and ex-producer [[Lizz Winstead]] said of interviews with controversial figures:

<blockquote>"Jon's tremendous. I feel, though, when you are interviewing a [[Richard Perle]] or a [[Henry Kissinger|Kissinger]], if you give them a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary."<ref>{{cite web

During Stewart's appearance on CNN's [[Crossfire (TV series)|''Crossfire'']], he criticized that show and its hosts for "hurting America" by reducing issues to a left vs. right screaming match and enabling political [[spin (public relations)|spin]]. When co-host [[Tucker Carlson]] complained that Stewart did not ask John Kerry substantial questions when Kerry appeared on ''The Daily Show'', Stewart countered that it was not his job to give hard-hitting interviews.  Suggesting that a "fake news" comedy program should not be held to the same standards as real journalists, Stewart said, "You're on CNN!  The show that leads into me is [[Crank Yankers|puppets making crank phone calls]]! What is wrong with you?" Stewart also directly addressed the criticism, noting of his Kerry interview, "I also asked him if he was in Cambodia", in reference to accusations that disputed some of Kerry's service record in Vietnam. However, he humourously added, "But I didn't care."<ref>{{cite web

=== Enabling complacency ===
[[Image:vilsacktds.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stewart mocks [[List of Governors of Iowa|Iowa Governor]] [[Tom Vilsack]]'s name.]]
In a [[March 3]], [[2006]], article in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', "Why Jon Stewart Isn't Funny", Michael Kalin argued that Jon Stewart's laughs come at the expense of idealism and to easily enable American college students to adopt a self-righteous attitude toward politics, ultimately rendering them complacent and apathetic.

<blockquote>"Stewart...leads to a "holier than art thou" attitude [among students] toward our national leaders. People who possess the wit, intelligence, and self-awareness of viewers of ''The Daily Show'' would never choose to enter the political fray full of "buffoons and idiots." Content to remain perched atop their Olympian ivory towers, these bright leaders head straight for the private sector."<ref>{{cite news

A ''Daily Reflector'' article about ''The Daily Show'' viewers concluded that they trust their own knowledge in politics, rather than the news media or the elites who run the political-media system. The article suggests that citizens who believe they understand politics may be more active in the system than those who do not. Yet the article also points out that cynicism can be a voter turnoff.<ref>{{cite news

== Editions for various markets ==
[[Image:Dailyshowwarning.png|thumb|200px|Disclaimer at the beginning of the Global Edition.]]
An edited version of the show, called '''''The Daily Show&mdash;Global Edition''''', is run outside of the U.S. on [[CNN International]] once a week on several weekend time slots. This edition is always prefaced by the following announcement, which is also displayed in written form against a ''Daily Show'' background:
"The show you are about to watch is a news parody. Its stories are not fact checked. Its reporters are not journalists. And its opinions are not fully thought through." Viewers are invited to send comments regarding the show to CNN by email.
For the Global Edition, Stewart provides an exclusive introductory monologue in front of an audience, usually about the week's prevalent international news story, and closing comments without an audience present. The segments for the Global Edition are usually culled from Monday and Tuesday's episodes. Strong language is often censored on CNN, even if it means losing a punch line.

[[Westwood One]] had broadcast small portions of the show to many radio stations across America. This ended, unannounced, in 2006.

;{{AUS}}
In [[Australia]] the regular show airs on [[The Comedy Channel]] Monday to Thursday at 9:30pm, roughly one day behind the US broadcast. The Global Edition airs on CNN on Sundays at 1:30am and is repeated on Mondays at 12:30am. Free-to-air broadcaster [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] also intermittently runs The Global Edition on Thursdays at 10pm and on Sundays at 1:45am.

;{{CAN}}
In Canada, the program airs four nights a week on the free-to-air [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] stations at 12:05 a.m. Local time, after the local news, as well as 4:00 p.m. the day after the original airing.  A [[simulcast]] of the show also airs at 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time (and re-run throughout the day) on [[The Comedy Network]].

;{{GBR}} and {{IRL}}
Since [[October 10]], [[2005]], both the Global Edition and the weeknight program have been shown in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Ireland]] at 8:30pm on the free-to-air digital channel, [[More4]]. Each episode is repeated later, usually between 11:00pm and 12:00 a.m., but this is variable. The Global Edition (without the preface shown on CNN International) is shown on Monday, with the regular Monday through Thursday editions shown on a one-day delay Tuesday to Friday. The Global Edition still airs in the UK on CNN International.

;{{DEU}}
In Germany, the ''Daily Show'' will be launched in April 2007 on the German ''Comedy Central''.<ref>Smith, David Gordon. It is available since [[23 January]] [[2007]] on the German Comedy Central Homepage Video Viewer, where it is stored for one day due to the German-American time shift difference [http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,449206,00.html "Comedy Central Comes to Germany: Can Jon Stewart Make the Krauts Laugh?"] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'' ([[November 17]], [[2006]]). Retrieved on [[November 26]], [[2006]]</ref> Also, since the inception of Comedy Central Germany, the Daily Show is available via the German homepage of Comedy Central. [http://www.comedycentral.de]. There viewers can watch the most recent episode in English language without German subtitles in full length..

;Nordic countries
''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' is also available in the Nordic countries ([[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] & [[Denmark]]) at 19:00 (20:00 in Finland) on the [[Canal+]] (Nordic) channel. Since [[February 26]] [[2007]] it is also available in Denmark  on [[DR2]] on Mondays-Wednesdays at 23:30 and Thursdays at 23:40, roughly two days behind the US broadcast.

;{{PHL}}
In the [[Philippines]], cable channel [[Jack TV]] airs ''The Daily Show'' at a half-day delay every Tuesday-Friday (given the time difference), alongside other Comedy Central shows.

;{{ISR}}
In Israel, the global edition airs on the Yes+ satellite channel every Thursday night, with reruns throughout the following weekend.

;Other countries
In April 2006, the show began screening in [[New Zealand]] at 22:00 Tuesdays on music channel [[C4 (New Zealand)|C4]]- however, as of [[30 January]] [[2006]], C4 has been screening the US version of the show four days a week. The show airs in [[Portugal]] on the Sic Radical (Portuguese) cable channel (it stopped airing for a while in 2006, but viewer feedback made the show be shown again).  It can also be seen on the [[American Forces Network]].

== Spin-offs ==
{{main|The Colbert Report|Red State Diaries}}
A spin-off, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', was announced in early May 2005. The show stars [[Stephen Colbert]], and serves as [[Comedy Central]]'s answer to the programs of media pundits such as [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]. The word "Report" in the show's title, like "Colbert", is pronounced with a silent "t". Colbert, Stewart, and Ben Karlin pitched the idea of the show to Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog, who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without first creating a pilot. ''The Colbert Report'' first aired on [[October 17]], [[2005]], and takes up the 11:30 [[UTC-5]] slot following ''The Daily Show''. Initial ratings satisfied Comedy Central and the show was renewed for a year.
