'''Wamsutta''' (b. c. 1634 - d. 1662), also '''Alexander Pokanoket''' as he was called by [[New England]] colonists, was a leader ([[sachem]]) of the [[Wampanoag]] [[Native Americans in the United States|native American]] [[tribe]].

==Family==
Wamsutta was the eldest son of [[Massasoit]] and brother of [[Metacomet]]. He married [[Weetamoo]]. He received the name "Alexander" from English settlers in 1656.

== Leadership and death ==
In 1660, Massasoit died and Wamsutta assumed leadership of the Wampanoag, becoming leader of all the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes between the [[Charles River]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Narraganset Bay]] in [[Rhode Island]], including the tribes in eastern Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts. He substantially increased the power of the Wampanoag by selling land to other colonies (as a result of a collapse of the [[fur trade]]), and in 1662 this resulted in his being summoned to and seized by the [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] Court. After being questioned Wamsutta became ill and soon died.

The cause of death was disputed, and Wamsutta's brother Metacomet (who now assumed leadership of the Wampanoag) suspected that he was poisoned. Wamsutta's death was one of the factors that would eventually lead to the 1675 [[King Philip's War]].

== Legacy ==
The name, Wamsutta, has been used in a number of areas:
*In 1846, the [[Wamsutta Company]]'s [[textile]] mill opened in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].
*In 1861, 20 year old [[Henry H. Rogers]] and his partner Charles Ellis of Massachusetts named their tiny venture near [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] the [[Wamsutta Oil Refinery]]. Rogers later became a principal in [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]] empire.
*[[USS Wamsutta (1853)|USS ''Wamsutta'']] was the name of a [[United States Navy]] [[Steamboat|steamer]] in commission from 1863 to 1865.
*In 1866, the [[Wamsutta Club]] was founded in New Bedford. It was a club for the affluent members of New Bedford's community, which at the time was supported by the flagging [[whaling]] industry as well as the up-and-coming textiles for which the club was named.
*In 1997, the Wamsutta Middle School was built in [[Attleboro, Massachusetts]] for [[Attleboro Public Schools.]]
*In modern times, Wamsutta is a brand name of textile products marketed by Springs Industries, Inc.
