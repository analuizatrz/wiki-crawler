He was cremated. His ashes were scattered at the Hunt Family house in [[Closter, New Jersey]]. 

In accordance with his wishes, a portion of Richard's ashes were also scattered in Venice, Italy by a friend on September 21, 2007. (As stated by Richard's mother, Jane, in a recent 2008 Muppet podcast.)
