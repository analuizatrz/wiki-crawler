'''Daryle Lamar Ward''' (born [[June 27]], [[1975]] in {{city-state|Lynwood|California}}) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[outfielder]] and [[first baseman]] for the [[Chicago Cubs]]. He bats and throws left-handed. The 6-foot-2, 240 pound (109 kg) Ward was drafted by the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[1994 in sports|1994]] amateur draft. He is the son of former major leaguer [[Gary Ward]]. As of 2006, he was one of six active major leaguers (along with [[Moisés Alou]], [[David Bell (baseball player)|David Bell]], [[Barry Bonds]], [[Prince Fielder]], and [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]]) to hit 20 home runs in a season whose fathers had also hit 20 home runs in an MLB season.

==Professional career==
Ward came to the [[Houston Astros]] in December [[1996 in sports|1996]] as part of a ten-player trade with Detroit. He debuted in [[1999 in baseball|1999]], hitting 8 home runs in 150 at bats.  In 2000, he hit 20 [[home run]]s in just 264 [[At bat|at-bats]]. In his third season for the Astros, Ward [[Batting average|batted]] .263 with 9 home runs and 39 [[run batted in|RBI]] in 95 games. The next year, 2002, he batted .276 with 12 home runs and 72 RBIs in 136 games. On July 6 of that year, he became the first (and remains, to date, the only) player to hit a home run out of Pittsburgh's [[PNC Park]] and into the [[Allegheny River]] on the fly in a regular season game, the shot coming off [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pittsburgh]]'s [[Kip Wells]].  Many Home Runs have made the river on the bounce, and several home runs hit during the 2006 Major League Baseball [[Home Run Derby]] made the river on the fly as well, creating speculation of juiced balls. 

After the season the Astros traded Ward to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He spent [[2003 in baseball|2003]] in a part-time role, hitting .183 with one [[extra base hit]] (a [[double (baseball)|double]]) in 109 at-bats. After the season, the Dodgers released Ward, and the Pirates signed him as a minor league [[free agent]]. Ward played better in 2004, and the Pirates re-signed him for [[2005 in sports|2005]] as their part-time first baseman. Ward has signed on to become a member of the Chicago Cubs bench for 2007. In 549 career games played, Ward has batted .259 (384-1485), with 65 HRs, 254 RBI, 155 [[Run (baseball statistics)|runs]], 80 doubles and four [[triple (baseball)|triples]], with an [[on base percentage]] (OBP) of .306 and [[slugging percentage]] (SLG) of .447.

===2004 season===
After being called up from the Triple-A [[Nashville Sounds]] to replace [[Raúl Mondesí]], Ward got off to a torrid start. On [[May 26]], [[2004]], Ward, recalled from the Triple-A [[Nashville Sounds]] two weeks before, hit for the cycle and tied his career high with six RBI in the Pirates' 11-8 victory over the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Ward hit a two-run [[Double (baseball)|double]] in the first, an RBI [[Triple (baseball)|triple]] in the fourth, golfed a three-run [[Home run|homer]] in the fifth and [[Hit (baseball statistics)|singled]] in the ninth. He was the first Pittsburgh player to hit for the cycle since [[Jason Kendall]] on [[May 19]], [[2000]], against the Cardinals. It has been done 23 times in club history and 243 times since [[1882 in baseball|1882]].

Ward joined his father, Gary, to become the first father-son combination in major league history to hit for the cycle. The older Ward accomplished the feat on September 18, [[1980 in baseball|1980]], for the [[Minnesota Twins]]. Ward slumped later in the season, slowed down by a wrist [[injury]], and finished hitting .249 with 15 HR and 57 RBI, with a .306 OBP and .474 SLG. Ward, along with [[Valerio de los Santos]], signed a deal to play with the Nationals, .

===2006 season===
On [[August 31]], [[2006]], Ward was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for minor-league pitcher [[Luis Atilano]].

===2007 season===
Ward was signed on [[December 7]], [[2006]] by the [[Chicago Cubs]] to a one-year deal worth $1.05 million after hitting .308 with a .380 OBP in 2006 for Washington and Atlanta in 150 combined plate appearances. He replaced [[John Mabry]] as a backup at 1st base to [[Derrek Lee]]. On [[May 6]], Ward hit a game winning single against his former team, the [[Washington Nationals]]. He was also called to replace Derrek Lee on [[May 13]], after Lee left the game with neck [[spasms]]. Ward also saw time as an [[pinch hitter]] in close game situations.  On [[August 18]] Ward hit a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] in the third inning off of [[St. Louis Cardinals]] pitcher [[Anthony Reyes]], the third of his career and his first home run as a member of the Cubs.

===2008 season===
On August 15 Ward launched a three-run pinch-hit homer with one out in the ninth inning to lift the Cubs to a 6-5 victory over the Florida Marlins for their ninth straight road win. This was the play that saved the game for the Cubs and allowed them to win against Florida, in Florida. The Cubs had lost their last 10 games at that stadium.
