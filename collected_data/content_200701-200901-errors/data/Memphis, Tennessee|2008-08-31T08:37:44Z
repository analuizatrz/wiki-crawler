A resident of Memphis is referred to as a ''[[List of famous people from Memphis|Memphian]]'' and the Memphis region is known as the [[Mid-South]].

==History==
{{main|History of Memphis, Tennessee}}
===Early history===
[[Image:Chromesun mississippian priest digital painting.jpg|thumb|A [[Mississippian Culture|Mississippian era]] priest (Digital illustration, 2004)]]
The Memphis area was first settled by the [[Mississippian Culture]] and then by the [[Chickasaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribe]]. European exploration came years later, with [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] and [[France|French]] explorers led by [[René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]].<ref>[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=F047 Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture - Fort Prudhomme and La Salle]</ref>

The land comprising present-day Memphis remained in a largely unorganized territory throughout most of the 18th century. By 1796, the community was the westernmost point of the newly admitted state of Tennessee.

===Foundation===
Memphis was founded in 1820 , the city was named after the [[Memphis, Egypt|ancient capital]] of [[Egypt]] on the [[Nile River]].  

The [[cotton]] economy of the antebellum South depended on the forced labor of large numbers of [[History of slavery in the United States|African-American slaves]], and Memphis became a major slave market. 

[[Tennessee#History|Tennessee]] seceded from the Union in June 1861 and Memphis briefly became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold. [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces captured Memphis in the [[Battle of Memphis]] on [[June 6]], [[1862]], and the city remained under [[Union army|Union]] control for the duration of the war. Memphis became a Union supply base and continued to prosper throughout the war.

===20th century===
[[Image:Union Avenue.jpg|thumb|[[Cotton]] merchants on Union Avenue (1937)]]
Memphis grew into the world's largest spot cotton market and the world's largest hardwood lumber market. Into the 1950s, it was the world's largest mule market.<ref>[http://www.cityofmemphis.org/framework.aspx?page=296 City of Memphis Website - History of Memphis]</ref>  

From the 1910s to the 1950s, Memphis was a hotbed of [[machine politics]] under the direction of [[E. H. Crump|E. H. "Boss" Crump]]. During the Crump era, Memphis developed an extensive network of parks and public works as part of the national [[City Beautiful Movement]].

During the 1960s the city was at the center of [[civil rights]] issues, notably the location of a sanitation workers' strike. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was assassinated on April 4, 1968 at the [[Lorraine Motel]].

Memphis is well known for its cultural contributions to the identity of the [[Southern United States|American south]]. Many renowned musicians grew up in and around the Memphis and northern Mississippi area.<ref>Peter Guralnick. New York Times, August 11, 2007</ref> These included such musical greats as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[W.C. Handy]], [[B.B. King]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Booker T. Jones]] and [[Al Green]].

===Crime===
[[Image:Mpdcar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Memphis Police Department|Memphis Police]] car (2007)]]
While in 2004, violent crime in Memphis was at a record low for more than a decade, that trend has changed.  In 2005, Memphis was ranked the 4th most dangerous city with a population of 500,000 or higher in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#500,000+ Morgan Quitno 2006 Crime Rankings]</ref> Crime in Memphis increased in 2005, and has seen a dramatic rise in the first half of 2006.  Nationally, cities follow similar trends, and crime numbers tend to be cyclic.  Local experts and criminologists cite as possible causes to the rise in crime in Memphis to gang recruitment, and to a reduction of federal funding by 66% to the [[Memphis Police Department]].  

In the first half of 2006, robbery of businesses increased 52.5%, robbery of individuals increased 28.5%, and homicide increased 18% over the same period of 2005. The Memphis Police Department has responded with the initiation of Operation Blue C.R.U.S.H. (Crime Reduction Using Statistical History), which targets crime hotspots and repeat offenders.<ref>
