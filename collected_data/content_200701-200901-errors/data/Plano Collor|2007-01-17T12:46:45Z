The '''Plano Collor''' (Portuguese: '''Collor Plan''', after the name of the sponsoring [[President of Brazil|president]]) was officially called '''Plano Brasil Novo''' ('''New Brazil Plan'''), but the former name gained wide acceptance in the media and became the [[de facto]] name for a series of policies and procedures to control [[inflation]] in [[Brazil]] in [[1990]], during the [[President of Brazil|presidency]] of [[Fernando Collor de Mello]].

The Plano Collor was announced on [[March 15]] [[1990]] and had ambitious goals, such as putting the long-lasting [[economy|economic]] crisis to an end, bringing balance to the Brazilian economy and "elevating the country from the [[Third World|Third]] to the [[First World]]."

The existing currency, the [[Cruzado novo|cruzado novo]] was replaced by the 1986 [[Cruzeiro (monetary unit)|cruzeiro]] and a cap on bank account withdrawals was put in place. All Economic agents (such as individuals and corporations) were not allowed to withdraw more than [[Cruzeiro (monetary unit)|Cr$]] 50,000.00 from any bank account (be checking or investment) for a period of 18 months. This measure intended to meet the [[Monetarism|monetarist]] interpretation of inflation, artificially limiting the supply of (actually, the access to) money.

All [[Price|prices]] in the economy were "frozen" so that it was unlawful to change prices (e.g., supermarkets were forbidden to change prices on goods, but this proibition extended to wages as well).

A number of new taxes and tariffs were created and there were generalized tax increases for the existing taxes and tariffs.

The economy was gradually open for imports, after decades of isolation from international markets, causing the bankruptcy of many domestic corporations, faced with sudden competition and difficulties to make payments (due to the cap on bank accounts).

Feeling the pressure from corporations, the [[finance minister]] [[Zélia Maria Cardoso de Mello|Zélia Cardoso de Mello]] implemented the "Operação Torneirinha" ("Operation Little Tap"), that eased restrictions on bank accounts (the Cr$ 50,000.00 cap), so that corporations could meet their tax, wage and social security payments. Corporate investments were also freed from the restriction, which effectively harmed only individual investors.

Inflation actually fell in the very first months of the Plano Collor but, as restrictions on money velocity and supply were lifted, inflation was back by the end of 1990 with full force, reaching 1,198% per year, when the Plano Cruzado II was announced.
