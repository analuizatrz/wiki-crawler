'''''Ailanthus altissima''''' ({{pronEng|eɪˈlænθəs ælˈtɪs<s>ɪ</s>mə}}<ref>{{citation| title=The Oxford English Dictionary| edition=2nd| year=1989| Publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>), commonly known as '''tree of heaven''', '''ailanthus''', or in Chinese as '''''chouchun''''' ({{zh-cp|c=[[wikt:臭|臭]][[wikt:椿|椿]]|p=chòuchūn}}), is a [[deciduous]] tree in the [[quassia]] family ([[Simaroubaceae]]). It is native to northeast and central [[China]] as well as [[Taiwan]]. Unlike other members of the genus ''[[Ailanthus]]'', it is found in temperate climates rather than the tropics. The tree grows rapidly and is capable of reaching heights of 15&nbsp;metres (50&nbsp;ft) in 25&nbsp;years. However, the species is also short lived and rarely lives more than 50&nbsp;years. Other common names include '''China sumac''', '''copal tree''', '''stink tree''' and '''ghetto palm'''.

''A. altissima'' was first brought from China to Europe in the 1740s and to the United States in 1784. It was one of the first trees brought west during a time when ''[[chinoiserie]]'' was dominating European arts, and was initially hailed as a beautiful garden specimen. However, enthusiasm soon waned after gardeners became familiar with its suckering habits and its offensive odour. Despite this, it was used extensively as a street tree during much of the 19th century. Outside of Europe and the United States, the plant has been spread to many other areas beyond its native range. In a number of these, it has become an [[invasive species]] due to its ability to quickly colonise disturbed areas and suppress competition with [[allelopathy|allelopathic]] chemicals. It is considered a noxious weed in [[Australia]], the [[United States]], [[New Zealand]] and several countries in southern and eastern [[Europe]]. The tree also [[Basal shoot|re-sprouts]] vigorously when cut, making its eradication extremely difficult and time consuming.

In China, the tree of heaven has a long and rich history. It was mentioned in the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to balding. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], primarily as an [[astringent]]. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the [[ailanthus silkmoth]], a moth involved in [[silk]] production. Ailanthus has become a part of western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and subject matter of the best-selling American novel ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (novel)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' by [[Betty Smith]].

''A. altissima'' is a medium-sized tree that reaches heights between 17 and 27&nbsp;metres (56 and 90&nbsp;ft) with a diameter at breast height of about 1&nbsp;metre (40&nbsp;in).<ref name="USDF">{{cite web| last =Miller| first =James H.| coauthors =Yawney, Harry W. | title =Ailanthus altissima| work = Silvics of Forest Trees of the United States, Volume 2| publisher = United States Department of Forestry| date =1965, revised December 1990| url =http://na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/ailanthus/altissima.htm| accessdate =2007-05-29}}</ref> The [[bark]] is smooth and light grey, often becoming somewhat rougher with light tan fissures as the tree ages. The twigs are stout, smooth to lightly pubescent, and reddish or chestnut in colour. They have [[lenticel]]s as well as heart-shaped leaf scars (i.e. a scar left on the twig after a leaf falls) with many bundle scars (i.e. small marks where the veins of the leaf once connected to the tree) around the edges. The [[bud]]s are finely pubescent, dome shaped, and partially hidden behind the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]], though they are completely visible in the dormant season at the sinuses of the leaf scars.<ref name=harvard2/> The branches are light to dark gray in colour, smooth, lustrous, and containing raised lenticels that become fissures with age. The ends of the branches become pendulous. All parts of the plant have a distinguishing strong odour that is often likened to rotting peanuts or cashews.<ref name=invasive>{{cite web | last =Miller | first =James H. | title =Tree-of-heaven | work =Nonnative invasive plants of southern forests: a field guide for identification and control | publisher =Invasive.org | date =2003 | url =http://www.invasive.org/eastern/srs/TofH.html | accessdate =2007-05-29}}</ref>

The [[leaf|leaves]] are large, odd- or even-[[pinnate]]ly compound, and arranged alternately on the stem. They range in size from 30 to 90&nbsp;cm (1 to 3&nbsp;ft) in length and contain 10-41 leaflets organised in pairs, with the largest leaves found on vigorous young sprouts. The [[rachis]] is light to reddish-green with a swollen base. The [[leaflet]]s are [[leaf shape|ovate-lanceolate]] with entire margins, somewhat asymmetric and occasionally not directly opposite to each others. Each leaflet is 5 to 18&nbsp;cm (2 to 7&nbsp;inches) long and 2.5 to 5&nbsp;cm (1 to 2&nbsp;inches) wide.

''A. altissima'' is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with male and female flowers being borne on different individuals. Male trees produce three to four times as many flowers as the females, making the male flowers more conspicuous. Furthermore, the male plants emit a foul smelling odour while flowering to attract pollinating insects. Female flowers contain ten (or rarely five through abortion) sterile [[stamen]]s (stamenoides) with heart-shaped [[anther]]s. The [[pistil]] is made up of five free [[carpel]]s (i.e. they are not fused), each containing a single [[ovule]]. Their [[style (botany)|styles]] are united and slender with star-shaped [[stigma]]s.<ref name=harvard2/><ref name=king/> The male flowers are similar in appearance, but they of course lack a [[pistil]] and the stamens do function, each being topped with a globular [[anther]] and a glandular green disc.<ref name=harvard2/> The [[seed]]s borne on the female trees are 5&nbsp;mm in diameter and each is encapsulated in a [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] that is 2.5&nbsp;cm long (1&nbsp;inch) and 1&nbsp;cm broad, appearing July though August, but usually persisting on the tree until the next spring. The samara is twisted at the tips, making it spin as it falls and assisting wind dispersal.<ref name=USDF/><ref name=invasive/> The females can produce huge amounts of seeds, normally around 30,000 per kilogram of tree.<ref name=USDF/>

==Taxonomy==
The first scientific descriptions of the tree of heaven were made shortly after it was introduced to [[Europe]] by the French [[Jesuit]] [[Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville]]. d'Incarville had sent seeds from [[Peking]] via [[Siberia]] to his botanist friend [[Bernard de Jussieu]] in the 1740s. The seeds sent by d'Incarville were thought to be from the economically important and similar looking [[Chinese varnish tree]] (''Toxicodendron vernicifluum''), which he had observed in the lower [[Yangtze]] region, rather than the tree of heaven. d'Incarville attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in [[France]] and sent others on to [[Philip Miller]], the superintendent at the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]], and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in [[Busbridge]], [[England]].<ref name=harvard2/>

Confusion in naming began when the tree was described by all three men with three different names. In Paris, [[Linnaeus]] gave the plant the name ''Rhus succedanea'', while it was known commonly as ''grand vernis du Japon''. In London the specimens were named by Miller as ''Toxicodendron altissima'' and in Busbridge it was dubbed in the old classification system as ''Rhus Sinese foliis alatis''. There are extant records from the 1750s of disputes over the proper name between Philip Miller and [[John Ellis]], curator of Webb's garden in Busbridge. Rather than the issue being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant: [[Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart]] observed a specimen in [[Utrecht]] in 1782 and named it ''Rhus cacodendron''.<ref name=harvard2/>

Light was shed on the taxonomic status of ailanthus in 1788 when [[René Louiche Desfontaines]] observed the samaras of the Paris specimens, which were still labelled ''Rhus succedanea'', and came to the conclusion that the plant was not a [[sumac]]. He published an article with an illustrated description and gave it the name ''Ailanthus glandulosa'', placing it in the same genus as the tropical species then known as ''A. integrifolia'' (white siris, now ''[[Ailanthus triphysa|A. triphysa]]''). The name is derived from the [[Ambonese]] word ''ailanto'', meaning "heaven-tree" or "tree reaching for the sky".<!--shouldn't this be in [[Ailanthus]]?--><ref name=harvard/><ref name=harvard2/> The specific ''glandulosa'' , referring to the glands on the leaves, persisted until as late as 1957, but it was ultimately made invalid as a later homonym at the species level.<ref name=harvard2/> The current species name comes from [[Walter T. Swingle]] who was employed by the United States Department of Plant Industry. He decided to transfer Miller's older specific name into the genus of Desfontaines, resulting in the accepted name ''Ailanthus altissima''.<ref name=Swingle>{{cite journal| last=Swingle| first=Walter T.| year=1916| title=The early European history and the botanical name of the tree of heaven, Ailanthus altissima| journal=Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences| volume=6| number=14| pages =409-498}}</ref> ''Altissima'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for "very tall", and refers to the sizes the tree can reach. The plant is sometimes incorrectly cited with the [[specific epithet]] in the masculine (''glandulosus'' or ''altissimus''), which is incorrect since botanical, like [[Classical Latin]], treats most tree names as feminine.

There are three [[variety (biology)|varieties]] of ''A. altissima'':
*''A. altissima'' var. ''altissima'', which is the type variety and is native to [[mainland China]].
*''A. altissima'' var. ''tanakai'', which is endemic to northern [[Taiwan]] highlands. It differs from the type in having yellowish bark, odd-pinnate leaves that are also shorter on average at 45 to 60&nbsp;cm long with only 13-25 scythe-like leaflets.<ref name=chinaflora>{{Cite encyclopedia | last =Huang | first =Chenjiu | title =''Ailanthus'' Desf. | year =1997 | encyclopedia =Flora Reipublicae Popularis Sinicae | volume = 43(3) | editor =Shukun Chen | volume =43(3) | pages =pp. 1-5 | location=Beijing | publisher =Science Press | id = ISBN 7-03-005367-2}}</ref><ref name=chinainvade>{{cite web| last =Zheng| first =Hao| coauthors =wu, Yun; Ding, Jianqing; Binion, Denise; Fu, Weidong; Reardon, Richard| title =Ailanthus altissima| work =Invasive Plants of Asian Origin Established in the United States and Their Natural Enemies, Volume 1| publisher =USDA Forest Service| date =September 2004| url =http://www.invasive.org/weeds/asian/ailanthus.pdf| accessdate =2007-06-06}}</ref><ref name=taiwan>{{cite web| last =Li| first =Hui-lin| | title =Simaroubaceae| work =Flora of Taiwan, Volume 3, 2nd Edition| date =1993| url =http://tai2.ntu.edu.tw/udth/bin/fot1.exe/browse?bid=3&page=545| accessdate =2007-05-29 }}</ref> It is listed as endangered in the [[IUCN Red List]] of threatened species due to loss of habitat for building and industrial plantations.<ref name=IUCN>{{cite web| last =Pan| first =F.J.| title =Ailanthus altissima var. tanakai| work =2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species| date =1998| url =http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/31349/all| accessdate =2007-05-29 }}</ref>

The tree prefers moist and loamy soils, but is adaptable to a very wide range of soil conditions and [[pH]] values. It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of flooding. It also does not tolerate deep shade.<ref name=USDF/> In China it is often found in [[limestone]]-rich areas.<ref name=chinainvade/> The tree of heaven is found within a wide range of climatic conditions.<ref name=USDF/> In its native range it is found at high altitudes in Taiwan<ref name=IUCN/> as well as lower ones in mainland China.<ref name=harvard2/> In the U.S. it is found in arid regions bordering the [[Great Plains]], very wet regions in the southern [[Appalachians]], and cold areas of the lower [[Rocky Mountains]]. Prolonged cold and snow cover cause dieback, though the trees re-sprout from the roots.<ref name=USDF/>

===As an exotic plant===
The earliest introductions of ''A. altissima'' to countries outside of its native range were to the southern areas of [[Korea]] as well as to [[Japan]]. It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that the tree was a very early introduction.<ref>{{cite book| last =Little Jr.| first =Elbert L.| title =Checklist of United States Trees (Native and Naturalized)| publisher =USDA Forest Service| date =1979| location =Washington, DC| pages =p. 375| oclc=6553978 }}</ref> Within China itself it has also been naturalised beyond its native range in areas such as [[Qinghai]], [[Ningxia]] and [[Xinjiang]].<ref name=chinainvade/>

In 1784, not long after Jussieu had sent seeds to England, some were forwarded to the [[United States]] by [[William Hamilton]], a gardener in [[Philadelphia]].

In [[North America]], ''A. altissima'' is present from [[Massachusetts]] in the east, west to southern [[Ontario]], southwest to [[Iowa]], south to [[Texas]], and east to the north of [[Florida]].

==Ecology==
[[Image:Ailanthus-altissima.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A female bearing a heavy load of seeds in [[Valladolid]], [[Spain]]]]
Ailanthus is an opportunistic plant that thrives in full sun and disturbed areas. It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively by [[root sprout]]s. It can re-sprout rapidly after being cut.<ref name=USDF/> It is considered a shade-intolerant tree and cannot compete in low-light situations,<ref>{{cite journal| last=Grime| first=J. P.| title=Shade Tolerance in Flowering Plants| journal=Nature| date=October 9, 1965| volume=208| pages=161-163| doi=10.1038/208161a0}}</ref> though it is sometimes found competing with hardwoods, but such competition rather indicates it was present at the time the stand was established.<ref name=USDF/> On the other hand, a study in an old-growth [[Tsuga|hemlock]]-hardwood forest in [[New York]] found that Ailanthus was capable of competing successfully with native trees in canopy gaps where only 2 to 15% of full sun was available. The same study characterised the tree as using a "gap-obligate" strategy in order to reach the forest canopy, meaning it grows rapidly during a very short period rather than growing slowly over a long period.<ref name=bard>{{cite journal| last=Knapp| first=Liza B.|coauthors= Canham, Charles D.| title=Invasion of an Old-Growth Forest in New York by Ailanthus altissima: Sapling Growth and Recruitment in Canopy Gaps| journal=Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society| volume=127| issue=4| date=October - December, 2000| pages=307-315|doi=10.2307/3088649}}</ref> It is a short lived tree in any location and rarely lives more than 50 years.<ref name=USDF/> Ailanthus is among the most pollution-tolerant of tree species, including to [[sulfur dioxide]], which it absorbs in its leaves. It can withstand cement dust and fumes from coal tar operations, as well as resist [[ozone]] exposure relatively well. Furthermore, high concentrations of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] have been found built up in tissues of the plant.<ref name=naturec/>

Ailanthus has been used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine drainage has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximatively that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low [[phosphorus]] levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system.<ref name=naturec/> It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes.<ref name=harvard2/> Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.<ref name=naturec/>
[[Image:Ailanthus altissima (female).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Female tree growing in [[Chicago, Illinois]] ]]
Ailanthus produces an [[allelopathy|allelopathic chemical]] called [[ailanthone]], which inhibits the growth of other plants.<ref name=allelo3>{{cite journal| last =Heisy| first =Rod M.| title = Identification of an Allelopathic Compound from Ailanthus altissima (Simaroubaceae) and Characterization of its Herbicidal Activity| journal =American Journal of Botany| volume =83| issue =2| pages =192-200| date =February 1996| doi =10.2307/2445938}}</ref> The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of [[garden cress]] (''Lepidium sativum'') seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, [[redroot pigweed]] (''Amaranthus retroflexus''), [[velvetleaf]] (''Abutilon theophrastii''), [[yellow bristlegrass]] (''Setaria glauca''), [[barnyard grass]] (''Echinochloa crusgalli''), [[pea]] (''Pisum sativum'' cv.

The tree of heaven is a very rapidly growing tree, possibly the fastest growing tree in North America.<ref name="feis">{{cite web| last=Howard| first=Janet L.| title=Ailanthus altissima| url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/ailalt/all.html| work=Fire Effects Information System| publisher=USDA Forest Service| year=2004| accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref> Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6&nbsp;ft) per year for the first four years are considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. Studies found that [[California]]n trees grew faster than their [[East Coast]] counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.<ref name="feis"/>

In [[northern Europe]] the tree of heaven was not considered naturalised in cities until after the [[Second World War]]. This has been attributed to the tree's ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow.<ref name=neophyt/> In addition, the warmer [[microclimate]] in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas. For example, one study in Germany found the tree of heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of [[Berlin]], 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether.<ref name=neophyt/> In other areas of Europe this is not the case as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in [[Hungary]], for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that country's [[Aggtelek National Park]].<ref name=neophyt/>

Several species of [[Lepidoptera]] utilise the leaves of ailanthus as food, including the [[Indian moon moth]] (''Actias selene'') and the [[grass yellow]] (''Eurema hecabe''). In North America the tree is the host plant for the [[ailanthus webworm]] (''Atteva punctella''), though this [[ermine moth]] is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] and originally used other members of the mostly tropical [[Simaroubaceae]] as its hosts.<ref>{{cite web| last = Barnes| first = Jeffrey K.| title = Ailanthus webworm moth| work = University of Arkansas Arthropod Museum Notes| publisher=University of Arkansas| date = June 2, 2005| url =http://entomology.uark.edu/museum/ailamoth.html| accessdate = 2007-06-20}}</ref> In its native range ''A. altissima'' is associated with at least 32 species of [[arthropods]] and 13 species of [[fungi]].<ref name=chinainvade/>

Due to the tree of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control in order to keep its populations in check. For example, the city of [[Basel]] in Switzerland has an eradication program for the tree.<ref name=neophyt/> It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regime is a mixture of chemical and physical control. This involves the application of foliar or basal [[herbicides]] in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.<ref name=control>{{cite web| last=Swearingen| first=Jil M.| coauthors=Pannill, Phillip| title=Tree-of-heaven| publisher=Plant Conservation Alliance's Alien Plant Working Group| date=2006| url=http://www.nps.gov/plants/alien/fact/aial1.htm}}</ref><ref>For a more thorough discussion, see the entry for ''Ailanthus ailtissima'' in the [[b:A Wikimanual of Gardening/Ailanthus altissima|Wikimanual of Gardening]] at [[Wikibooks]].</ref>

==Uses==
[[Image:Samia cynthia adult male sjh.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A male ailanthus silkmoth from the [[Texas A&M]] insect collection]]
In addition to its use as an ornamental plant, the tree of heaven is also used for its wood, medicinal properties, and as a host plant to feed [[silkworm]]s of the moth ''[[Samia cynthia]]'', which produces [[silk]] that is stronger and cheaper than [[mulberry]] silk, although with inferior gloss and texture. It is also unable to take dye. This type of silk is known as "[[pongee]]" or "Shantung silk", the second name being derived from the [[Shandong Province]] of China where this silk is often produced. Its production is particularly well known in the [[Yantai]] region of that province. The moth has also been introduced in the United States.<ref name=harvard2/>

The pale yellow, close-grained and satiny wood of ailanthus has been used in cabinet work.<ref name=Keeler /> It is flexible and well suited to the manufacture of kitchen [[steaming|steamers]], which are important in [[Chinese cuisine]] for cooking [[mantou]], pastries and rice. The [[Chekiang Province]] of eastern China is most famous for producing these steamers.<ref name=harvard2/> It is also considered a good source of firewood across much of its range as it moderately hard and heavy, yet readily available.<ref name=fuel/> There are problems with using the wood as lumber, however. Because the trees exhibit rapid growth for the first few years, the trunk has uneven texture between the inner and outer wood, which can cause the wood to twist or crack during drying. Techniques have been developed for drying the wood so as to prevent this cracking, allowing it to be commercially harvested. Although the live tree tends to have very flexible wood, the wood is quite hard once properly dried.<ref>{{cite web| last=Gill| first=Barbara| title=Ailanthus| publisher=Woodworker's Website Association| year=2004| url =http://www.woodworking.org/WC/Woods/004.html| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>

===Cultivation===
Tree of heaven is a popular [[ornamental tree]] in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions.<ref name=chinainvade/> It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odour of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odour was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results.<ref name=harvard/> [[Michael Dirr]], a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): {{quote|For most landscaping conditions, it has ''no'' value as there are too many trees of superior quality; for impossible conditions this tree has a place; selection could be made for good habit, strong wood and better foliage which would make the tree more satisfactory; I once talked with an architect who tried to buy ''Ailanthus'' for use along polluted highways but could not find an adequate supply &#91;...&#93;|Michael A.

In the [[United Kingdom]] it is especially common in [[London]] squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and [[East Anglia]]. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only seldomly in southern [[Scotland]]. It is also rare in [[Ireland]].<ref name="Mitchell">{{cite book| last =Mitchell| first =Alan| authorlink =Alan Mitchell| title =Trees of Britain & Northern Europe| publisher =Harper Collins| date =1974| location =London| pages =pp. 310-311| isbn= 0-00-219213-6 }}</ref> In [[Germany]] the tree is commonly planted in gardens.<ref name=schmeil>{{de icon}} {{cite book| last =Schmeil| first =Otto| authorlink =| coauthors =Fitschen, Jost; Seybold, Siegmund| title =Flora von Deutschland, 93.

===Medicinal===
Nearly every part of ''A. altissima'' has some application in [[Chinese traditional medicine]]. One of the oldest recipes, recorded in a work from 732 AD, is used for treating mental illness. It involved chopped root material, young boys' [[urine]] and [[douchi]]. After sitting for a day the liquid was strained out and given to the patient over the course of several days.<ref name=harvard2/>

Another source from 684 AD, during the [[Tang dynasty]] and recorded in [[Li Shizhen]]'s ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'', states that when the leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, [[abscess]]es and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, [[catalpa]] and [[peach]] tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.<ref name=harvard2/>

The dried [[bark]], however, is still an officinal drug and is listed in the modern Chinese [[materia medica]] as ''chun bai pi'' ({{zh-cp|c=椿白皮|p=chūnbáipí}}), meaning "white bark of spring". Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion, which is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally cut into strips. The bark is said to have cooling and [[astringent]] properties and is primarily used to treat [[dysentery]], intestinal [[hemorrhage]], [[menorrhagia]] and [[spermatorrhea]]. It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10 grams, so as not to poison the patients. Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical use as it contains a long list of active chemicals that include [[quassin]] and [[saponin]], while ailanthone, the allelopathic chemical in the tree of heaven, is a known [[antimalarial agent]].<ref name="burows"/> It is available in most shops dealing in [[Chinese traditional medicine]].<ref name=harvard2/> A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in treating cardiac palpitation, [[asthma]] and [[epilepsy]].<ref name=king>{{cite web|last=Felter| first=Harvey Wickes| coauthor= John Uri Lloyd| year=1898|title=''Ailanthus''.—Ailanthus. | url= http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/kings/ailanthus.html |work=King's American Dispensatory| publisher=Henriette's Herbal Homepage| accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

The [[Samara (fruit)|samara]]s are also used in modern Chinese medicine under the name ''feng yan cao'' ({{zh-stp|s=凤眼草|t=鳳眼草|p=fèngyǎncǎo}}), meaning "herbal phoenix eye". They are used as a [[hemostatic]], [[spermatorrhea]] and for treating patients with blood in their feces or urine. It was clinically shown to be able to treat [[trichomoniasis]], a vaginal infection caused by the [[protozoan]] ''Trichomonas vaginalis''.<ref name=harvard2/> In occident, an extract of the bark sold under the [[Synonymy|synonym]] ''A. glandulosa'' is sometimes used as an herbal [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] remedy for various ailments including [[cancer]].<ref name=fuel>{{cite web| last=Duke| first=James A.| title=Ailanthus altissima| work=Handbook of Energy Crops| year=1983| publisher=Purdue University Center for New Crops & Plant Products| url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/Ailanthus_altissima.html| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with [[contact dermatitis]] reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a [[quinone]] irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active [[quassin]]oids which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.<ref name="burows">{{cite book| last=Burrows| first=George Edward| Coauthors=Ronald J.

==Culture==
In addition to the tree of heaven's various uses, it has also been a part of Chinese culture for many centuries and has more recently attained a similar status in the west. Within the oldest extant Chinese dictionary, the [[Erya]], written in the 3rd century BC, the tree of heaven is mentioned second among a list of trees. It was mentioned again in a [[materia medica]] compiled during the [[Tang dynasty]] in 656 AD. Each work favoured a different character, however, and there is still some debate in the Chinese botanical community as to which character should be used. The current name, ''chouchun'' ({{zh-cp|c=臭椿|p=chòuchūn}}), means "stinking spring", and is a relatively new appellation. People living near the lower [[Yellow River]] know it by the name ''chunshu'' ({{zh-stp|s=椿树|t=椿樹|p=chūnshù}}), meaning "spring tree". The name stems from the fact that ''A. altissima'' is one of the last trees to come out of dormancy, and as such its leaves coming out would indicate that winter was truly over.<ref name=harvard2/>
[[Image:Tree grows cover smith.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover of a 2006 reprint of Betty Smith's ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' with a drawing of ailanthus in the background]]
In [[Chinese literature]], ailanthus is often used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing a father and a stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write "wishing your ailanthus and [[daylily]] are strong and happy", with ailanthus metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a "good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout", meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of [[Zhuangzi]], a [[Taoist]] philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions.<ref name=harvard2/>

The 1943 book ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (novel)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' by [[Betty Smith]] uses the tree of heaven as its central metaphor, using it as an analogy for the ability to thrive in a difficult environment. At the time as well as now, ailanthus was common in neglected urban areas.<ref name=harvard/><ref name=penn/> She writes:{{quote|There's a tree that grows in Brooklyn. Some people call it the Tree of Heaven. No matter where its seed falls, it makes a tree which struggles to reach the sky. It grows in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps. It grows up out of cellar gratings. It is the only tree that grows out of cement. It grows lushly...survives without sun, water, and seemingly earth. It would be considered beautiful except that there are too many of it.|''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn''|Introduction}}

Ailanthus is also sometimes counter-[[nickname]]d "tree from hell" due its prolific [[Invasive plants|invasiveness]] and the difficulty in eradicating it.<ref name=penn>{{cite press release| title = Penn State Scientists: Tree of Heaven Really Isn't | publisher = Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences | date = [[1999]] [[June 14]] | url = http://www.aginfo.psu.edu/news/june99/heaventree.html | accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Fergus| first=Charles| title=Trees of New England: a Natural History| year=2005| location=Guildford| publisher=Falcon| pages=p. 289| isbn=0-7827-3795-6}}</ref> In cities, it often bears the name "ghetto palm" because of its propensity for growing in the infertile soils of urban areas, or on abandoned and poorly maintained properties. Ingo Vetter, a German artist and professor of fine arts at [[Umea University]] in [[Sweden]], was influenced by the idea of the "ghetto palm" and installed a living ailanthus tree taken from [[Detroit]] for an international art show called ''Shrinking Cities'' at the KW Institute of Contemporary Art in [[Berlin]] in 2004.<ref>{{Cite news| last =Collins| first =Lisa M.| title =Ghetto Palm| publisher =Metro Times Detroit| date =December 10, 2003| url =http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=5723| accessdate=2007-07-07 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| last =Wasacz| first =Walter| title =Big Ideas for Shrinking Cities| publisher =Model D| date =January 30, 2007| url =http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/shrinking79.aspx| accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>
