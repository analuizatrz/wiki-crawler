'''Bhagat Singh''' ([[Punjabi]]: ਭਗਤ ਸਿੰਘ بھگت سنگھ, {{IPA2|pə̀gət̪ sɪ́ŋg}}) ([[September 27]], [[1907]]<ref>{{cite web| title = He left a rich legacy for the youth | publisher = [[The Tribune]] | author = | date = 2006-03-19 | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060319/society.htm#2| accessdate = 2008-01-01 }}</ref> &ndash;[[March 23]], [[1931]]) was an [[India]]n freedom fighter, considered to be one of the most famous [[revolutionary|revolutionaries]] of the [[Indian independence movement]]. For this reason, he is often referred to as ''Shaheed'' Bhagat Singh (the word ''[[martyrdom in Islam|shaheed]]'' means "[[martyr]]"). He is also believed by some historians, such as [[K. N. Panikkar]], to be one of the earliest [[Marxism|Marxists]] in India.<ref>{{cite web| title = Bhagat Singh an early Marxist, says Panikkar | publisher = [[The Hindu]] | author = | date = 2007-10-14 | url = http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/14/stories/2007101454130400.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-01 }}</ref> Singh was also one of the leaders and founders of the [[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association]] (HSRA).

Born to a family which had earlier been involved in [[revolutionary]] activities against the [[British Raj]] in India, Singh, as a teenager, had studied European revolutionary movements and was attracted to [[anarchism]] and [[communism]].<ref name="RD">{{cite journal |last=Rao |first=Niraja |year=1997 |month=April |title=Bhagat Singh and the Revolutionary Movement |journal=Revolutionary Democracy |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages= |url=http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv3n1/bsingh.htm}}</ref> He became involved in numerous revolutionary organizations. He quickly rose through the ranks of the [[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association|Hindustan Republican Association]] (HRA) and became one of its leaders, converting it to the HSRA. Singh gained support when he underwent a 63-day fast in jail, demanding equal rights for Indian and British political prisoners. He was hanged for shooting a police officer in response to the killing of veteran social activist [[Lala Lajpat Rai]]. His legacy prompted youth in India to begin fighting for Indian independence and also increased the rise of socialism in India.<ref name="whatif">{{cite web| title = What if Bhagat Singh had lived | publisher = [[The Tribune]] | author = Reeta Sharma| date = 2001-03-21 | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010321/edit.htm#6| accessdate = 2008-01-01 }}</ref>

==Early life==
[[Image:Bhagat17.jpg|thumb|Bhagat Singh at the age of 17]]
Singh was born into a [[Jatt]] [[Sandhu]]<ref name="RD"/> family to Sardar Kishan Singh Sandhu and Vidyavati in the Khatkar Kalan village near Banga in the [[Faisalabad District|Lyallpur district]] of [[Punjab region|Punjab]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Panjab Under the British Rule, 1849-1947 |last=Nijjar |first=Bakhshish Singh |year=1974 |publisher=K. B. Publications |location= |pages=p172 |isbn= }}</ref> Singh's given name of Bhagat means "devotee". He came from a patriotic [[Sikh]] family, some of whom had participated in movements supporting the independence of India and others who had served in [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Punjab)|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of Political Parties |editor=O. P. Ralhan |year=2002 |publisher=Anmol Publications |location=[[New Delhi]], [[India]]|pages=Vol. 26, p349 |isbn=81-7488-313-4}}</ref> His grandfather, Sardar Kishan Singh, was a follower of [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]]'s Hindu reformist movement, [[Arya Samaj]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Bhagat Singh: Making of a Revolutionary: Contemporaries' Portrayals |last=Sanyal| first=Jitendra N. |year=2006 |publisher=Hope India Publications |location=[[Gurgaon]], [[Haryana]], [[India]]|pages=p25 |isbn=81-7871-059-5}}</ref> which would carry a heavy influence on Singh. His uncles, Ajit Singh and Swaran Singh, as well as his father were members of the [[Ghadar Party]], led by [[Kartar Singh Sarabha Grewal]] and [[Har Dayal]]. Ajit Singh was forced to flee to [[Persia]] because of pending cases against him while Swaran Singh was hanged on [[December 19]], [[1927]] for his involvement in the [[Kakori train robbery]] of 1925.<ref>Sanyal (2006), p30.</ref>

Unlike many Sikhs his age, Singh did not attend Khalsa High School in Lahore, because his grandfather did not approve of the school officials' loyalism to the British authorities.<ref>Sanyal (2006), p20.</ref> Instead, his father enrolled him in [[Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Schools System|Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School]], an Arya Samajist school.<ref>{{cite book |title=Students' Britannica India |last=Hoiberg |first=Dale H.|authorlinks=[[Dale Hoiberg]]| coauthors=Indu Ramchandani |year=2000 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.

At this point he had openly defied the [[British Raj|British]] and had followed Gandhi's wishes by burning his government-school books and any British-imported clothing. Following Gandhi's withdrawal of the movement after the violent murders of policemen by villagers from [[Chauri Chaura]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], Singh, disgruntled with Gandhi's nonviolence action, joined the Young Revolutionary Movement and began advocating a violent movement against the British.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Martyr: Bhagat Singh Experiments in Revolution |last=Nayar |first=Kuldip |year=2006 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |location=New Delhi, India |pages=pp20-21 |isbn=8124107009 }}</ref>

In 1923, Bhagat famously won an essay competition set by the Punjab Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. This grabbed the attention of members of the Punjab Hindi Sahitya Sammelan including its General Secretary Professor Bhim Sen Vidyalankar. At this age, he quoted famous Punjabi literature and discussed the ''Problems of the Punjab''. He read a lot of poetry and literature which was written by Punjabi writers and his favourite poet was [[Allama Iqbal]] from [[Sialkot]].<ref>[http://www.shahidbhagatsingh.org/index.asp?link=problem_of_pb Bhagat Singh Documents] ''Problems of the Punjab''</ref>

In his teenage years, Bhagat Singh started studying at the National College in Lahore,<ref>Sanyal (2006), p23.</ref> but ran away from home to escape early marriage, and became a member of the organization ''Naujawan Bharat Sabha'' ("Youth Society of India").<ref name="RD"/> In the Naujawan Bharat Sabha, Singh and his fellow revolutionaries grew popular amongst the youth. He also joined the [[Hindustan  Republican Association]] at the request of Professor Vidyalankar, which was then headed by [[Ram Prasad Bismil]] and [[Shahid Ashfaqallah Khan|Ashfaqulla Khan]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}} It is believed that he had knowledge of the [[Kakori train robbery]]. He wrote for and edited [[Urdu]] and [[Punjabi]] [[newspapers]] published from [[Amritsar]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}} In September 1928, a meeting of various revolutionaries from across India was called at [[Delhi]] under the banner of the ''Kirti Kissan Party''. Bhagat Singh was the secretary of the meet. His later [[revolutionary]] activities were carried out as a leader of this association. The capture and hanging of the main HRA Leaders also allowed him to be quickly promoted to higher ranks in the party, along with his fellow revolutionary [[Sukhdev Thapar]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

==Later revolutionary activities== <!--Feel free to change this heading if you think of something better-->
===Lala Lajpat Rai's death and the Saunders murder===
The [[British government]] created a [[Simon Commission|commission]] under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] to report on the current political situation in India in [[1928]]. The Indian political parties boycotted the commission because it did not include a single Indian as its member and it was met with protests all over the country. When the commission visited Lahore on [[October 30]], [[1928]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] led the protest against the commission in a silent non-violent march, but the police responded with violence.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} The police chief beat Lala Lajpat Rai severely and he later succumbed to his injuries. Bhagat Singh, who was an eyewitness to this event, vowed to take revenge.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} He joined with other revolutionaries, [[Shivaram Rajguru]], Jai Gopal and [[Sukhdev Thapar]], in a plot to kill the police chief. Jai Gopal was supposed to identify the chief and signal for Singh to shoot. However, in a case of mistaken identity, Gopal signalled Singh on the appearance of J. P. Saunders, a Deputy Superintendent of Police. Thus, Saunders, instead of Scott, was shot. Bhagat Singh quickly left [[Lahore]] to escape the police. To avoid recognition, he shaved his beard and cut his hair, a violation of one of the sacred tenets of [[Sikhism]].

===Bomb in the assembly===
In the face of actions by the revolutionaries, the British government enacted the Defence of India Act to give more power to the police.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} The purpose of the Act was to combat revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh. The Act was defeated in the council by one vote.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} However, the Act was then passed under the ordinance that claimed that it was in the best interest of the public. In response to this act, the [[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association]] planned to explode a bomb in the assembly where the ordinance was going to be passed. Originally, Azad attempted to stop Bhagat Singh from carrying out the bombing; however, the remainder of the party forced him to succumb to Singh's wishes. It was decided that Bhagat Singh and [[Batukeshwar Dutt]], another revolutionary, would throw the bomb in the assembly.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

On [[April 8]], [[1929]], Singh and Dutt threw a bomb onto the corridors of the assembly and shouted "''Inquilab Zindabad!''" ("Long Live the Revolution!").<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_24-3-2004_pg7_9 Bhagat Singh remembered - Daily Times Pakistan]</ref> This was followed by a shower of leaflets stating that it takes a loud voice to make the deaf hear.<ref>[http://www.shahidbhagatsingh.org/index.asp?link=april8 Bhagat Singh Writings] ''Leaflet Thrown in the Central Assembly Hall''</ref> The bomb neither killed nor injured anyone; Singh and Dutt claimed that this was deliberate on their part, a claim substantiated both by British [[forensics]] investigators who found that the bomb was not powerful enough to cause injury, and by the fact that the bomb was thrown ''away'' from people. Singh and Dutt gave themselves up for arrest after the bomb.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} He and Dutt were sentenced to '[[Penal transportation|Transportation for Life]]' for the bombing on [[June 12]], [[1929]].

===Trial and execution===
[[Image:The Tribune front page of Bhagat Singh's execution.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Front page of ''[[The Tribune]]'' announcing Bhagat Singh's execution.]]Shortly after his arrest and [[trial]] for the Assembly bombing, the British came to know of his involvement in the murder of J. P. Saunders. Bhagat Singh, [[Rajguru]], and [[Sukhdev]] were charged with the [[murder]]. Bhagat Singh decided to use the court as a tool to [[propaganda|publicize]] his cause for the independence of India.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} He admitted to the murder and made statements against the British rule during the trial.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} The case was ordered to be carried out without members of the HSRA present at the hearing. This created an uproar amongst Singh's supporters as he could no longer publicise his views.

While in jail, Bhagat Singh and other prisoners launched a hunger strike advocating for the rights of prisoners and those facing trial. The reason for the strike was that British murderers and thieves were treated better than Indian political prisoners, who, by law, were meant to be given better rights. The aims in their strike were to ensure a decent standard of food for political prisoners, the availability of books and a daily newspaper, as well as better clothing and the supply of toilet necessities and other hygienic necessities. He also demanded that political prisoners should not be forced to do any labour or undignified work.<ref>[http://www.shahidbhagatsingh.org/index.asp?link=hunger_strike Bhagat Singh Documents] Bhagat Singh and BK Dutt's Demands from the British Government </ref> During this hunger strike that lasted 63<!--NOT 133 or any other number; see reference--> days and ended with the British succumbing to his wishes, he gained much popularity among the common Indians. Before the strike his popularity was limited mainly to the [[Punjab region]].<ref> [http://pd.cpim.org/2006/0319/03192006_surjeet.htm Communist Party of India (Marxist)] ''Bhagat Singh Remains Our Symbol of Revolution'' </ref>

Bhagat Singh also maintained the use of a diary, which he eventually made to fill 404 pages. In this diary he made numerous notes relating to the quotations and popular sayings of various people whose views he supported. Prominent in his diary were the views of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].<ref>[http://www.shahidbhagatsingh.org/index.asp?linkid=30 Shahid Bhagat Singh] ''Jail Note Book of Shahid Bhagat Singh''</ref> The comments in his diary led to an understanding of the philosophical thinking of Bhagat Singh.<ref name="jailquotes">[http://www.shahidbhagatsingh.org/index.asp?link=quotes1 Shahid Bhagat Singh] ''Bhagat Singh quotes from his jail note book''</ref> Before dying he also wrote a pamphlet entitled "Why I am an atheist", as he was being accused of vanity by not accepting God in the face of death.

On [[March 23]], [[1931]], Bhagat Singh was [[hanged]] in [[Lahore]] with his fellow comrades Rajguru and Sukhdev. His supporters, who had been protesting against the hanging, immediately declared him as a ''shaheed'' or martyr.<ref>[http://pd.cpim.org/2006/0423/04232006_bhagat%20singh.htm CPIM] ''Bhagat Singh Memorial Day Observed''</ref> According to the Superintendent of Police at the time, V.N. Smith, the hanging was advanced:

<blockquote>Normally execution took place at 8 am, but it was decided to act at once before the public could become aware of what had happened...At about 7 pm shouts of Inquilab Zindabad were heard from inside the jail. This was correctly, interpreted as a signal that the final curtain was about to drop.<ref> [http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051211/spectrum/main1.htm The Tribune India] ''Excerpts out of Martyrdom of Shaheed Bhagat Singh''</ref></blockquote>

Singh was cremated at [[Hussainiwala]] on banks of [[Sutlej]] river. Today, the [[Bhagat Singh Memorial]] commemorates freedom fighters of India.<ref>[http://pd.cpim.org/2006/0423/04232006_bhagat%20singh.htm CPIM] ''Bhagat Singh Memorial Day Observed''</ref>

==Ideals and opinions==
[[Image:Bhagat20.jpg|thumb|Bhagat Singh in jail at the age of 20]]
===Marxism===
Bhagat Singh's political thought evolved gradually from Gandhian [[nationalism]] to revolutionary [[Marxism]]. By the end of 1928, he and his comrades renamed their organization the [[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association]]. He had read the teachings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]]<Ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Bhagat_Singh_no_terrorist_Govt/articleshow/2639054.cms Bhagat Singh no terrorist: Govt] [[Times of India]] - December 21, 2007</ref> and believed that, with such a large and diverse population, India could only survive properly under a [[socialist]] regime. These ideals had been introduced to him during his time at the National College at Lahore and he believed that India should re-enact the [[October Revolution|Russian revolution]]. In the case that India were not [[socialist]], he believed that the rich would only get richer and the poor would only get poorer. This, and his militant methods, put him at odds with Gandhi and members of the Congress. He became the first socialist leader in India to make any gain. Even today, socialist leaders sometimes refer back to him as the founder of Indian socialism.<ref name="CPIM Surjeet">[http://pd.cpim.org/2006/0319/03192006_surjeet.htm Bhagat Singh Remains Our Symbol of Revolution] ''People's Democracy'' - March 19, 2006</ref><ref name="CPIM Front Page">[http://www.cpindia.org/ Communist Party of India] 25th January 2006, letter to Manmohan Singh </ref>

===Atheism===
During his teenage years, Singh was a devout Arya Samajist <ref>[http://www.punjabilok.com/misc/freedom/whyiam_ath.htm Why I Am An Atheist - By Bhagat Singh]</ref>, however he began to question religious ideologies after witnessing the Hindu-Muslim riots that broke out after Gandhi disbanded the Non-Cooperation Movement.<ref>Nayar, p26.</ref> He did not understand how members of these two groups, initially united in fighting against the British, could be at each others' throats because of their religious differences. At this point, Singh dropped his religious beliefs, since he believed religion hindered the revolutionaries' struggle for independence, and began studying the works of [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] — all atheist revolutionaries. He also took an interest in Niralamba Swami's<ref>Niralamba Swami was the name taken by [[Bengal]]i revolutionary [[Jatindra Nath Banerjee]], an early member of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], after he gave up his political activism and became an [[asceticism|ascetic]].</ref> book ''Common Sense'', which advocated a form of "mystic atheism".<ref>Nayar, p27.</ref>

While in a condemned cell in 1931, he wrote a pamphlet entitled ''Why I am an Atheist'' in which he discusses and advocates the philosophy of [[atheism]]. This pamphlet was a result of some criticism by fellow revolutionaries on his failure to acknowledge religion and God while in a condemned cell, the accusation of [[vanity]] was also dealt with in this pamphlet. He supported his own beliefs and claimed that he used to be a firm believer in The Almighty, but could not bring himself to believe the myths and beliefs that others held close to their hearts. In this pamphlet, he acknowledged the fact that [[religion]] made death easier, but also said that unproved [[philosophy]] is a sign of human weakness.<ref name="Atheist">{{cite web | first=Bhagat| last=Singh | title=Why I am an Atheist: Bhagat Singh | publisher=People's Publishing House |location= New Delhi, India | url=http://www.sacw.net/DC/CommunalismCollection/ArticlesArchive/bhagatSinghATHIEST.html | accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

===Death===
Bhagat Singh was known for his appreciation of [[martyr]]dom. His mentor as a young boy was [[Kartar Singh Sarabha]].<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010321/edit.htm#6 Tribune India] ''What if Bhagat Singh had lived''</ref> Singh is himself considered a [[martyr]] by many Indians for acting to avenge the death of [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], also considered a martyr. In the leaflet he threw in the Central Assembly on 9th April 1929, he stated that ''It is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas. Great empires crumbled while the ideas survived''.<ref>[http://www.shahidbhagatsingh.org/index.asp?link=april8 Bhagat Singh Documents] ''Leaflet thrown in the Central Assembly Hall, New Delhi ''</ref> After engaging in studies on the Russian Revolution, he wanted to die so that his death would inspire the youth of India to unite and fight the British Empire.

While in prison, Bhagat Singh and two others had written a letter to the Viceroy asking him to treat them as prisoners of war and hence to execute them by [[firing squad]] and not by [[hanging]]. Prannath Mehta, Bhagat Singh's friend, visited him in the jail on March 20, four days before his execution, with a draft letter for clemency, but he declined to sign it.<ref name="Frontline"/>

==Conspiracy theories==
Many [[conspiracy theories]] exist regarding Singh, especially the events surrounding his death. 

===Mahatma Gandhi===
One of the most popular ones is that [[Mahatma Gandhi]] had an opportunity to stop Singh's execution but did not. This particular theory has spread amongst the public in modern times after the creation of modern films such as ''The Legend of Bhagat Singh'', which portray Gandhi as someone who was strongly at odds with Bhagat Singh and did not oppose his hanging.<ref>''[[The Legend of Bhagat Singh]]'' (2002 film)</ref> A variation on this theory is that Gandhi actively conspired with the British to have Singh executed. Both theories are highly controversial and hotly contested. Gandhi's supporters say that Gandhi did not have enough influence with the British to stop the execution, much less arrange it. Furthermore, Gandhi's supporters assert that Singh's role in the independence movement was no threat to Gandhi's role as its leader, and so Gandhi would have no reason to want him dead. 

Gandhi, during his lifetime, always maintained that he was a great admirer of Singh's [[patriotism]], but that he simply disapproved of his violent methods. He also said that he was opposed to Singh's execution (and, for that matter, [[capital punishment]] in general) and proclaimed that he had no power to stop it. On Singh's execution, Gandhi said, "The government certainly had the right to hang these men. However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only."<ref> ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi.'' Ahmedabad, Navjivan. vol. 45, p.359-61 (Gujarati) </ref> Gandhi also once said, on capital punishment, "I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows. God alone can take life because He alone gives it."

Gandhi had managed to have 90,000 political prisoners who were not members of his [[Satyagraha]] movement released under the pretext of "relieving political tension," in the [[Gandhi-Irwin Pact]]. According to a report in the Indian magazine ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'', he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, [[Rajguru]] and [[Sukhdev]], including a personal visit on March 19, 1931, and in a letter to the Viceroy on the day of their execution, pleading fervently for commutation, not knowing that the letter would be too late.<ref name="Frontline">[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1808/18080910.htm Frontline - Of Means and Ends] ''by Paresh R. Vaidya''.]</ref>

Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, later said: <blockquote>
As I listened to Mr. Gandhi putting the case for commutation before me, I reflected first on what significance it surely was that the apostle of non-violence should so earnestly be pleading the cause of the devotees of a creed so fundamentally opposed to his own, but I should regard it as wholly wrong to allow my judgment to be influenced by purely political considerations. I could not imagine a case in which under the law, penalty had been more directly deserved.<ref name = "Frontline"/>
</blockquote>

===Saunders family===
On October 28, 2005, a book entitled ''Some Hidden Facts: Martyrdom of Shaheed Bhagat Singh -- Secrets unfurled by an Intelligence Bureau Agent of British-India'' [''[[sic]]''] by K.S. Kooner and G.S. Sindhra was released. The book asserts that Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were deliberately hanged in such a manner as to leave all three in a semi-conscious state, so that all three could later be taken outside the prison and shot dead by the Saunders family. The book says that this was a prison operation codenamed "Operation Trojan Horse." Scholars are skeptical of the book's claims.<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051211/spectrum/main1.htm The Sunday Tribune] ''Was Bhagat Singh shot dead?''</ref>

==Legacy==
===Indian independence movement===
Bhagat Singh's death had the effect that he desired and he inspired thousands of youths to assist the remainder of the [[Indian independence movement]]. After his hanging, youths in regions around [[Northern India]] rioted in protest against the [[British Raj]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

===Modern day legacy===
The [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] itself acknowledges Bhagat Singh's contribution to Indian society<ref name="CPIM Surjeet">[http://pd.cpim.org/2006/0319/03192006_surjeet.htm Bhagat Singh Remains Our Symbol of Revolution<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="CPIM Front Page">[http://www.cpindia.org/ Communist Party of India] 25th January 2006, letter to Manmohan Singh </ref> and, in particular, the future of [[socialism]] in India. To celebrate the centenary of his birth, a group of intellectuals have set up an institution to commemorate Singh and his ideals.<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070101/region.htm The Tribune Chandigarh] ''In memory of Bhagat Singh''</ref>

Several popular [[Bollywood]] films have been made capturing the life and times of Bhagat Singh.<ref name="films">[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/06/03/stories/2002060300500100.htm The Hindu] ''...A non-stop show''</ref> The oldest was ''Shaheed'' in [[1965]], starring [[Manoj Kumar]] as Singh. Two major films about Singh were released in [[2002]], ''[[The Legend of Bhagat Singh]]'' and ''[[23rd March 1931: Shaheed]]''. ''The Legend of Bhagat Singh'' is [[Rajkumar Santoshi]]'s adaptation, in which [[Ajay Devgan]] played Singh and [[Amrita Rao]] was featured in a brief role. ''23 March 1931: Shaheed'' was directed by Guddu Dhanoa and starred [[Bobby Deol]] as Singh, with [[Sunny Deol]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]] in supporting roles.

The [[2006]] film ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' (starring [[Aamir Khan]]) is a film drawing parallels between revolutionaries of Bhagat Singh's era and modern Indian youth. It covers a lot of Bhagat Singh's role in the Indian freedom struggle. The movie revolves around a group of college students and how they each play the roles of Bhagat's friends and family.

The patriotic [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] songs, ''[[Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna]]'' (translated as "the desire to sacrifice") and ''Mera Rang De Basanti Chola'' ("my light-yellow-colored cloak"; Basanti referring to the light-yellow color of the [[Mustard plant|Mustard flower]] grown in the Punjab and also one of the two main colors of the Sikh religion as per the Sikh ''rehat meryada''(code of conduct of the Sikh Saint-Soldier) ), while created by [[Ram Prasad Bismil]], are largely associated to Bhagat Singh's martyrdom and have been used in a number of Bhagat Singh-related films.<ref name="films"/>

In September 2007 the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province announced that a memorial to Bhagat Singh will be displayed at Lahore museum, according to the governor “Singh was the first martyr of the subcontinent and his example was followed by many youth of the time."<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C09%5C02%5Cstory_2-9-2007_pg7_33 Memorial will be built to Bhagat Singh, says governor - Daily times Pakistan]</ref><ref>[http://www.dawn.com/2007/09/26/ed.htm#2 Requiem for a freedom fighter]</ref>

==Criticism==
Bhagat Singh was criticized both by his contemporaries and by people after his death because of his violent and revolutionary stance towards the British and his strong opposition to the [[pacifism|pacifist]] stance taken by the [[Indian National Congress]] and particularly [[Mahatma Gandhi]].<ref name="Sukhdevletter">[http://www.punjabilok.com/misc/freedom/sukh_togandhi.htm Punjabi Lok] ''Sukhdev's letter to Gandhi''</ref> The methods he used to make his point&mdash;shooting Saunders and throwing non-lethal bombs&mdash;were quite different to the non-violent [[Gandhism|non-cooperation]] used by Gandhi.<ref name="Sukhdevletter"/> He was accused of having knowledge of the [[Kakori train robbery]] by the British.<ref name="Atheist"/>

Bhagat Singh has also been accused of being too eager to die, as opposed to staying alive and continuing his movement. It has been alleged that he could have escaped from prison if he so wished, but he preferred that he die and become a legacy for other [[youth]]s in India. Some lament that he may have done much more for India had he stayed alive.<ref name="whatif"/>
