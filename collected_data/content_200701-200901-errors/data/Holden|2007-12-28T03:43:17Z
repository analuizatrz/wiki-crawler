'''Holden''', officially '''GM Holden Ltd''', is an [[Australia]]n [[automaker]] based in [[Port Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The company was originally independent but since 1931 has been a subsidiary of [[General Motors]] (GM).<ref name = "profile">{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/companyprofile/companyprofile.jsp | title = Holden: Company Profile | publisher = GM Holden | accessdate = 2007-10-30}}</ref> Holden has taken charge of vehicle operations for General Motors in [[Australasia]] and, on behalf of GM, holds partial ownership of [[GM Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]]. Over the years, Holden has offered a broad range of locally produced vehicles, supplemented by various imported GM models. In the past, Holden has offered [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Nissan]] and [[Toyota]] models in sharing arrangements.

Holden [[Bodywork|car bodies]] are manufactured at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]], and engines are produced at [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]] (Fishermens Bend).<ref name = "profile"/> Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]]: [[Acacia Ridge, Queensland]], [[Dandenong, Victoria]], [[Mosman Park, Western Australia]], [[Pagewood, New South Wales]], and [[Woodville, South Australia]] (body production only). Until 1990, [[Holden New Zealand]] also operated a plant based in [[Petone]]. The consolidation of car production at Elizabeth, South Australia, was completed in 1988, but some assembly operations continued at Dandenong until the mid-1990s.<ref name = "milestones">{{cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/history/history_milestones.html | title = Holden Company Milestones | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>

Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia has led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability; in 2006, exports alone accounted for almost [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1.3&nbsp;billion in earnings.

== History of the marque ==
=== Early history ===
In 1852, James Alexander Holden emigrated to [[South Australia]] from [[England]] and established '''J.A. Holden & Co''', a saddlery business in [[Adelaide]], in 1856.<ref name = "heritage1">{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Alistair | coauthors = Kennedy, Ewan; Davis, Tony | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part1.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition (Part One) | publisher = GM Holden | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> [[Edward Holden]], James' son, joined the firm in 1905 with an interest in automobiles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hancock | first = Joan | coauthors = Richards, Eric | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090705b.htm | title = Holden, Sir Edward Wheewall (1885 - 1947) | publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}</ref> From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden and Frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery.<ref name = "Holden History">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/history_holden.htm | title = Holden History | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages.<ref name = "milestones"/> After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to commence full-scale production of vehicle body shells. J.A. Holden incorporated a new company in 1919, '''Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd''' (HMBB) specialising in car bodies. By 1923, HMBB were producing 12,000 units per year.<ref name = "Holden History"/> From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of [[Bodywork|car bodies]] for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new [[Woodville, South Australia]] plant.<ref name = "The Holden car in Australia">{{cite web | url = http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/holdencar/index.htm | title = The Holden car in Australia | publisher = [[Government of Australia]] | accessdate = 2007-12-04}}</ref> These bodies were made to suit a number of [[chassis]] imported from manufacturers such as [[Chevrolet]] and [[Dodge]].<ref name = "Holden History"/> The [[Great Depression]] era led to a substantial downturn in production, from 34,000 units annually in 1930 to just 1,651 units one year later.<ref name = "Holden History"/> In 1931, General Motors purchased the business and formed '''General Motors–Holden's Ltd'''.<ref name = "heritage1"/> Since then, two name changes have occurred: the first, in 1998, changed the name to '''Holden Ltd''', and the second, in May 2005, to '''GM Holden Ltd'''.<ref name = "heritage1"/> 

=== 1940s ===
[[Image:1951-1953 Holden 50-2106 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Holden 50-2106]] [[Holden Ute|ute]] launched in 1951, three years after the [[Holden 48-215|48-215]] sedan.]]

Holden's first full-scale factory in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Fishermens Bend]] was completed in 1936, with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in [[Pagewood, New South Wales]].<ref name = "milestones"/> However, [[World War II]] delayed car production until April 1948 when the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.globalautoindex.com/maker.plt?no=61 | title = Holden (Australia) | publisher = Global Auto Systems Europe Kft | accessdate = 2007-11-23}}</ref> During the war years, production shifted to manufacture vehicle bodies, [[field gun]]s, [[aircraft]], aeroplane and marine engines.<ref name = "The Holden car in Australia"/> Both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and General Motors provided studies to the Australian Government to produce "Australia's Own Car". Ford's proposal was the Government's first choice, but required substantial financial assistance, whereas GM's was a three-page list of the members of parliament and what each member would receive in "financial aid".<ref name = "NAA">{{cite web | url = http://www.naa.gov.au/The_Collection/transport/road.html | title = Road transport | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051025213951/http://www.naa.gov.au/The_Collection/transport/road.html | archivedate = 2005-10-25 | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

Holden's managing director, [[Laurence Hartnett]], was particularly enthusiastic about developing and building an Australian car. The [[Holden 48-215|48-215]], also unofficially called the FX, was launched in 1948 fitted with a 132.5&nbsp;[[cubic inch]] (2,171&nbsp;cc) engine.<ref name = "heritage1"/> The design however, was based on a previously rejected post-war [[Chevrolet]] proposal.<ref>Loffler (2002), p. 5</ref>

=== 1950s ===
During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian market by offering buyers a combination of style, comfort, performance, economy, and value that no competitor could match. Less expensive four-cylinder cars did not offer Holden's ability to deal with rugged rural areas.<ref name = "NAA"/><ref name = "heritage1"/> Another factor in Holden's success was its large investment in production capacity, which allowed the company to meet increased post-war demand for motor cars.<ref name = "milestones"/> [[Holden 48-215|48-215]] sedans were produced in parallel with the [[Holden 50-2106|50-2106]] [[coupe utility]] from 1951; the latter was known [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] as the "Ute" and became ubiquitous in Australian [[rural]] areas as the workhorse of choice. Production continued with minor changes until 1953, when the Ute was replaced by the facelifted [[Holden FJ|FJ]] model.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2001-04-24]] | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/newsarticle.html?&start=70&showall=&id=HOL&doc=gmh0104242 | title = An Aussie Icon Turns 50 - The Holden Ute: 1951 - 2001 | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref> The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction. Over time it gained iconic status and remains one of Australia's most recognisable automotive symbols.<ref name = "heritage1"/> A new horizontally slatted radiator grille dominated the front-end of the FJ, which had other trim changes, along with a large rear window, but no changes were made to the body panels.<ref>Loffler (2004), p. 5</ref> Although the FJ was little changed from the 48-215, marketing campaigns and price cuts kept vehicle sales steady until a completely redesigned model, the FE, was launched in 1956, and offered as both a [[station wagon]] and a sedan. Mechanical components carried over from the FJ, but the appearance was very different. Strong sales continued in Australia, and Holden achieved a market share of more than 50 percent. The opening of a new plant in [[Dandenong, Victoria]] in 1956 brought with it further jobs, with Holden employing 19,000 workers country-wide by 1959.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[1959-11-02]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892818,00.html | title = The New Blokes | publisher = [[Time Inc.]] | accessdate = 2007-11-23}}</ref> Holden paid homage to the FJ with the [[Holden Efijy|Efijy]] [[concept car]] at the 2005 [[Australian International Motor Show]] in [[Sydney]].<ref>{{citation | last = Carey | first = John | title = Holden Efijy | year = 2005 | magazine = [[Wheels magazine]]: November 2005 | pages = 16}}</ref>

[[Image:1961-1962 Holden EK Special Station Sedan 01.jpg|thumb|left|The EK was Holden's response to the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]], and was available with [[automatic transmission]].]]

=== 1960s ===
In the 1960s, Holden faced serious competition for the first time; its major competitors began to import cars. In 1960, Holden began to offer its third major new model, the FB. The FB's style was inspired by that of 1950s Chevrolets, with [[tailfin]]s and a wrap-around [[windshield]] with "dog leg" [[Pillar (car)|A-pillars]]. By the time Holden introduced the model, many considered the appearance dated.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/chronicles_1960.htm | title = Chronicles: 1960 Year In Review | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> Much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact Holden. The FB became the first Holden that was adapted for [[Driving on the left or right|left-hand-drive]] markets, enhancing its export potential.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

In 1960, soon after Holden introduced the FB, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] unveiled the new [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] in Australia, only months after its introduction in the United States. To Holden's advantage, the Falcon was not durable, particularly in the front suspension. Early tests indicated that the Falcon was ill-suited for [[Environment of Australia|Australian conditions]], and Falcon customers later agreed.<ref>{{cite web | last = Mercer | first = Sandy | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_ford_falcon_xk.htm | title = Ford Falcon XK | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> In response to the Falcon, Holden introduced the facelifted EK in 1961; the new model featured two-tone paintwork, chrome trim, and optional [[automatic transmission]].<ref name = "heritage1"/> The EH, premiering in 1963, featured the new [[Holden Red motor|Red motor]], which provided better vehicle performance than the previous [[Holden Grey motor|Grey motor]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_red_motor.htm | title = Holden 6 Cylinder RED Motor | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> In February 1965 Holden introduced the HD,<ref name = "heritage1"/> quickly replaced by the facelifted HR in April 1966 because the car's styling proved unpopular. The HR had new front and rear styling and higher-capacity engines, and Holden sold more than 250,000 units in the two-year production run. More significantly, the HR Holden now had [[seat belt]]s as standard; Holden thus became the first Australian automaker to provide the safety device as standard equipment across all models.<ref name = "heritage2"/> 1966 also marked the completion of the production plant in [[Acacia Ridge, Queensland]].<ref name = "milestones"/>   

[[Image:1968-1971 Holden Brougham 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Holden Brougham]] (1968–1971) was Holden's first full-size luxury vehicle. Broughams were based on the mainstream [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswoods]] of the same years, but featured a lengthened rear body.]]

In 1968, Holden introduced its next major new model, the HK.<ref name = "HK">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hk.htm | title = Holden HK | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> This included Holden's first [[V8 engine]], a [[Chevrolet]] engine imported from the United States.<ref name = "heritage2">{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Alistair | coauthors = Kennedy, Ewan; Davis, Tony | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part2.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition (Part Two) | publisher = GM Holden | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> Models based on the HK series included an extended-length prestige model, the [[Holden Brougham|Brougham]], and the first two-door Holden, the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]].<ref>Davis (1987), p. 102</ref> The name "Monaro" is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning "higher ground" or "higher plain".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/4_05_hold.htm | title = Monaro arriving this year | publisher = WebWombat | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> In the HK series, the mainstream [[Holden Special]] was rebranded the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], and the basic [[Fleet vehicle|fleet model]], the [[Holden Standard|Standard]], became the [[Holden Belmont|Belmont]].<ref name = "HK"/> A facelifted HK, known as the HT, was introduced in 1969. Exterior changes included a new radiator grille,<ref name = "HT">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_ht.htm | title = Holden HT | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> new rear doors on sedans (with larger windows), and new rear styling with a larger rear window. Holden also introduced the first Australian-designed and mass-produced V8 engine, available in two capacities: 253&nbsp;cubic inch (4.2&nbsp;L) and 308&nbsp;cubic inch (5.0&nbsp;L).<ref name = "HT"/> The following year, Holden offered the HG, a lightly facelifted car with a revised radiator grille, tail lights, interior trim, and colours. The HG's big selling point was its Tri-Matic three-speed automatic transmission, which Holden produced at its [[Woodville, South Australia]], factory.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hg.htm | title = Holden HG | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref>

In 1964, Holden began assembling the HA series [[Vauxhall Viva]], marketing it as "Viva—the GMH small car" to de-emphasise the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] brand. The first [[Holden Torana]], the HB, replaced the Viva in 1967. Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969; this was the first compact six-cylinder car in the Australian marketplace,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_lc.htm | title = Holden Torana LC | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> and Holden's first [[compact car]] in a market dominated by [[Japan]]ese models. The name "Torana" is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning "to fly".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana.htm | title = Holden Torana | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref>

Despite the arrival of serious competitors—namely the Ford Falcon, [[Chrysler Valiant]], and Japanese cars—in the 1960s, Holden's locally produced large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles. Sales were boosted by exporting the Kingswood sedan, station wagon, and utility body styles to places such as [[Indonesia]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[South Africa]], where the vehicles were badged as the Chevrolet Kommando.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

[[Image:1971-1974 Holden HQ Kingswood sedan 01.jpg|thumb|left|Holden's HQ series sold in record numbers, with over 480,000 units shifted throughout the car's lifetime.]]

=== 1970s ===
In 1971, Holden launched its new HQ series, often considered the most important new model since the original Holden.<ref name = "heritage2"/> At this time, the company was producing all of its passenger cars in Australia, and every model was of Australian design; however, by the end of the decade, Holden was producing cars based on overseas designs. The HQ was thoroughly re-engineered, featuring a perimeter frame and semi-[[monocoque]] (unibody) construction. This provided a level of refinement not seen in this class of vehicle before. Other firsts included a wide, 60&nbsp;inch (1,500&nbsp;mm) track, all-coil suspension, an extended wheelbase for station wagons, utilities and [[panel van]]s. The series included a new prestige brand, [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]], which also had a longer wheelbase.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_HQ_technical_specifications.htm | title = Holden HQ Technical Specifications | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> The HQ framework led to a new generation of two-door [[Holden Monaro|Monaros]],<ref name = "heritage2"/> and, despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors, the HQ became the top-selling Holden of all time,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hq.htm | title = Holden HQ | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref> with 485,650 units sold in three years.<ref name = "heritage2"/>

The next development of the Torana was the LH series, introduced in 1974.<ref name = "LH">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_lh.htm | title = Holden Torana LH | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> The LH was offered only as a four-door sedan; a three-door hatchback variant was added in the superseding LX series (manufactured between 1976 and 1978). Engines for the LH and LX series included 1.9&nbsp;litre four-cylinder, 2.8&nbsp;litre and 3.3&nbsp;litre six-cylinder, and 4.2&nbsp;litre and 5.0&nbsp;litre eight-cylinder.<ref name = "LH"/> At the time, the Torana was the only car in the world to be offered with such a diverse range of engines. The four-cylinder Torana later became the [[Holden Sunbird|Sunbird]], sold from 1974 to 1980.<ref name = "LH"/> The UC series, which followed the LX in 1978, did not support the V8 engine range.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_uc.htm | title = Holden Torana UC | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-08-16}}</ref> 

[[Image:1978-1980 Holden VB Commodore 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] followed the success of its forbear, the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], becoming Holden's bestselling vehicle to date.]]

In 1975, Holden introduced the [[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini]], the Australian version of the [[GM T platform|T-Car]],<ref name = "heritage2"/> based on the [[Opel Kadett]] C.<ref name = "TX">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_tx.htm | title = Holden Gemini TX | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> The Gemini was an overseas design developed jointly with [[Isuzu]], GM's Japanese affiliate;<ref name = "TX"/> a badge on the rear of the car identified it as a "Holden-Isuzu". The new car was powered by an Isuzu 1.6&nbsp;litre four-cylinder engine,<ref name = "TX"/> and its styling resembled that of the Kadett. Fast becoming a popular car, the Gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class, and the nameplate lived on until 1987.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_rb.htm | title = Holden Gemini RB | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref>

Holden's most popular car to date, the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]], was introduced in 1978 as the [[Holden VB Commodore|VB]].<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 18</ref> The new family car was loosely based on the [[Opel Rekord]] E body shell, but with the front from the [[Opel Senator]] grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia.<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 22–23</ref> However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the car's acceptance. In particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival,  making it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers. This problem was not resolved until the 1988 introduction of the wider [[Holden VN Commodore|VN]], the first full-sized Commodore.<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 23, 26–27</ref>

Holden discontinued the Torana in 1979 and the Sunbird in 1980. After the 1978 introduction of the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]], the Torana became the "in-between" car, surrounded by the smaller and more economical [[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini]] and the larger, more sophisticated Commodore. The closest successor to the Torana was the [[Holden Camira|Camira]], released in 1982 as Australia's version of GM's medium-sized "[[GM J platform|J-Car]]".<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 24</ref>

[[Image:Holden VN calais 01.jpg|thumb|left|The second generation [[Holden VN Commodore|VN Commodore]] overcame the previous generations' width problems.]]

=== 1980s ===
The 1980s were challenging for Holden and for the Australian car industry. The Australian Government tried to revive the industry with the [[Button car plan]], which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars.<ref>{{cite web | last = Fuller | first = Glen | url = http://eventmechanics.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/Supercharged_Essay_Fuller.pdf | title = Road Test | accessdate = 2007-12-05}}</ref> In 1980, Holden shut-down its [[Pagewood, New South Wales]] production plant and introduced the light commercial Rodeo, sourced from Isuzu in Japan.<ref name = "milestones"/> The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive [[chassis cab]] models with a choice of [[Gasoline|petrol]] and [[diesel]] powerplants.<ref name = "heritage2"/> The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the [[Isuzu TF]]. The Rodeo has been a mainstay ever since, and since 2003, has been sold in the form of the [[Isuzu D-Max]] produced in [[Thailand]].<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2003-04-18]] | url = http://www.isuzu.co.jp/world/press/news_event/n_030418.html | title = Isuzu's All New Pickups Popular in Thailand and Australia | publisher = [[Isuzu|Isuzu Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-11-14}}</ref> 

Holden faced financial challenges when sales of the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] and [[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini]] declined. Competition from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] intensified when the [[Ford Laser|Laser]], a compact car based on the [[Mazda 323]], and an updated [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] proved popular. Other Australian manufacturers, [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], and [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia|Mitsubishi Motors]] also gained market share.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kenwright | first = Joe | url = http://editorial.carsales.com.au/car-review/1916079.aspx | title = Crossing the Lion (July 2006) | publisher = carsales.com.au | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> When released in 1982, the [[Holden Camira|Camira]] initially generated good sales, which later declined because buyers considered the 1.6&nbsp;litre engine underpowered, and the car's build and ride quality below-average.<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 24</ref>

[[Image:1991-1994 Holden LF Nova SL hatchback 01.jpg|thumb|right|An unsuccessful model sharing alliance with [[Toyota]] led Holden to adopt the [[Toyota Corolla]] badge-engineered as [[Holden Nova]] ''(pictured)''.]]

In 1985, Holden's parent company, General Motors, reorganised and recapitalised the business, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process.<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 27</ref> The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder [[GM Family II engine]]s for use in cars built overseas.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2004-11-09]] | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_103082/title_Holden%20Reaches%20Golden%20Milestone%20With%2050%20Years%20Of%20Exports%20/newsarticle.html | title = Holden Reaches Golden Milestone With 50 Years Of Exports | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2007-08-16}}</ref> Holden exported its one millionth Family II engine in 1988 and its three millionth in 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/exports/exports.jsp?link=overview | title = Overview | publisher = GM Holden | accessdate = 2007-11-26}}</ref> Also in 1985, the [[Suzuki Swift]]-based [[Holden Barina|Barina]] was launched, becoming Holden's first truly small car.<ref name = "heritage2"/>

In 1984, Holden introduced the [[Holden VK Commodore|VK Commodore]], with significant styling changes from the previous [[Holden VH Commodore|VH]]. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the [[Holden VL Commodore|VL]], which had new front and rear styling.<ref name = "heritage2"/> Controversially, the VL was powered by the [[Nissan RB engine|Nissan ''RB30'']] 3.0&nbsp;litre six-cylinder engine and had an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2007-06-21]] | url = http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/environmental_management/air/caring_for_our_air/ | title = Caring for our air | publisher = [[Government of Queensland|State of Queensland]] | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref> Because it was infeasible to convert the six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine was chosen as the best engine available. However, changing exchange rates caused the cost of the engines to double over the life of the VL.<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 25</ref> Holden's decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the [[Woodville, South Australia]] assembly plant.

=== 1990s ===
The company changed throughout the 1990s, increasing its Australian market share from 21.0% in 1991 to 28.2% in 1999.<ref name = "Sales and Share of Australian Market Archive (1991-2002)">{{cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/finance/fin_sales_share_ARCHIVE.html | title = Sales and Share of Australian Market Archive (1991-2002) | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-11-21}}</ref> Besides manufacturing Australia's bestselling car, which was exported in significant numbers, Holden continued to export many locally produced engines to power cars made elsewhere. In this decade, Holden adopted a strategy of importing cars it needed to offer a full range of competitive vehicles.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/global_operations/asia_pacific/aust.html | title = GM Global Operations: Australia | publisher = [[General Motors]] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070427004252/http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/global_operations/asia_pacific/aust.html | archivedate = 2005-10-25 | accessdate = 2007-04-27}}</ref> 

On [[April 26]], [[1990]], GM's New Zealand subsidiary, [[Holden New Zealand]], announced that production at the assembly plant based in [[Petone]] would be phased out and that vehicles would be imported [[Duty (economics)|duty]]-free.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/heart/heritage/ | title = Heart of Holden - Holden Heritage | publisher = [[Holden New Zealand]] | accessdate = 2007-05-27}}</ref> During the 1990s Holden, other Australian automakers and [[trade union]]ists pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import [[tarrif]]s. By 1997, the federal government had already cut tariffs to 22.5% from 57.5% ten years earlier, and by 2000 were planning to reduce this even further down to 15%. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.<ref>{{cite web | last = Richardson | first = Michael | date = [[1997-04-24]] | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/04/24/cars.t_0.php | title = Automakers Say Cuts in Duties Would Maim Industry : Tussle on Tariffs in Australia | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | accessdate = 2007-11-23}}</ref>

Holden re-introduced its defunct [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] brand in 1990, this time under the Holden marque, as the [[Holden Statesman|Statesman and Caprice]] respectively. For 1991, Holden updated their Statesman and Caprice with a range of improvements, including the introduction of [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]], a first for an Australian-built car. This feature was added to short-wheelbase Commodore range in 1992.<ref name = "heritage1"/> Another returning variant was the [[Holden Ute|Ute]].<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 26–27</ref>. The [[Buick]]-sourced [[V6 engine]], produced locally, powered the Commodore range, as did the 5.0&nbsp;litre V8 engine, replaced in 1999 by a 5.7&nbsp;litre unit.<ref name = "heritage3">{{cite web | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part3.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition (Part Three) | publisher = GM Holden | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> 

The UAAI badge-engineered cars sold poorly, but the Holden Commodore, [[Toyota Camry]], and [[Toyota Corolla|Corolla]] were all successful when sold under their original nameplates. Potential customers saw that the "copies" were thinly disguised versions of popular cars, and purchased the vehicles from the original manufacturer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/60DB5F93CC0B207FCA256D21001310D6 | title = Car review - Holden Nova 5-dr hatch | publisher = John Mellor| accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> In 1994, the [[Opel Corsa]] replaced the already available [[Suzuki Swift]] as the source for the [[Holden Barina]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/D928D7E37EE64519CA256D210003F9D7 | title = Car review - Holden Barina Swing 5-dr hatch | publisher = John Mellor| accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> Later, in 1996, UAAI was dissolved, and Holden returned to GM products.<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 27</ref> The [[Holden Astra]] and [[Holden Vectra|Vectra]], both designed by [[Opel]] in [[Germany]], replaced the Toyota-sourced [[Holden Nova|Nova]] and [[Holden Apollo|Apollo]]. Assembly of Vectra began at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]] in 1998, and these cars were exported to [[Japan]] and [[Southeast Asia]] with Opel badges.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[1999-09-08]] | url = http://autoweb.com.au/cms/article.html?&A=51613 | title = Holden Announces Next Stage Of $1 Billion Export Drive | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2007-09-07}}</ref><ref name = "heritage1"/> However, the Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify local assembly, and reverted to being fully imported in 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/8FECAC2A36315B23CA256D65001A367C | title = Car review - Holden Vectra CDXi 5-dr hatch | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> 

In August 1997, Holden introduced the all-new [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]], the outcome of an $600 million development programme that spanned more than half a decade. The new model sported a rounded exterior body shell, improved dynamics, and many firsts for an Australian-built car. A stronger body structure increased crash safety.<ref name = "WheelsVEMag">{{citation | last = Newton | first = Bruce | last2 = Robinson | first2 = Peter | last3 = McCarthy | first3 = Mike | last4 = McKay | first4 = Peter | title = 2006 Collector's Edition VE Commodore: The Full Story | publisher = [[Australian Consolidated Press]] | journal = [[Wheels magazine]] | pages = 158 | date = October 2006}}</ref> A revived [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]], based on the VT Commodore, attracted wide attention after being shown as a [[concept car]] at Australian [[motor show]]s, and it drew a large waiting list after production began. The revived Monaro was released to the Australian market in October 2001 and ceased production in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-07-21]] | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/holden-monaro-cv8-z.htm | title = Holden Waves Goodbye to Monaro | publisher = WebWombat | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

=== 2000s ===
Holden's market surge from the 1990s reversed in the 2000s. In Australia, Holden's market share dropped from 27.5% in 2000 to 15.2% in 2006,<ref name = "Sales and Share of Australian Market Archive (1991-2002)"><ref>{{cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/finance/fin_sales_share.html | title = Sales and Share of Australian Market (2003-Present) | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-11-23}}</ref> and from March 2003, no longer held the number one sales position in Australia, losing ground to [[Toyota]].<ref>{{citation | title = Number Crunching | year = 2003 | magazine = [[Wheels magazine]]: May 2003 | pages = 181}}</ref> This overall downturn also affected daily production rates which were at 780 and 835 units per day in 2002 and 2004 respectively, to just 691 in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/companyprofile/companyprofile.jsp | title = Company Profile | publisher = GM Holden | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20031212202213/http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/companyprofile/companyprofile.jsp | archivedate = 2003-12-12 | accessdate = 2007-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/companyprofile/companyprofile.jsp | title = Company Profile | publisher = GM Holden | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050615232337/http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/companyprofile/companyprofile.jsp | archivedate = 2005-06-15 | accessdate = 2007-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/companyprofile/companyprofile.jsp | title = Company Profile | publisher = GM Holden | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061124002820/http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/companyprofile/companyprofile.jsp | archivedate = 2006-11-24 | accessdate = 2007-12-11}}</ref> Holden's profits during the 2000s also decreased; the company recorded a combined gain of $842.9 million between 2002 and 2004, and a loss of $290 million between 2005 and 2006. Factors contributing to the loss included the development of an all-new model, the strong [[Australian dollar]] and the cost of reducing the workforce at the Elizabeth plant, including the loss of 1,400 jobs after the closure of the third-shift assembly line in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2007-06-18]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/3250/holden-posts-146-million-loss/ | title = Holden Posts $146 Million Loss | publisher = CarAdvice.com.au | accessdate = 2007-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-01-20]] | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/Business/Mitsubishi-to-cut-250-jobs-says-union/2006/01/20/1137553752787.html | title = Mitsubishi to cut more jobs | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-11-23}}</ref>  

The company's trend of importing many of their models from [[Opel]] in [[Germany]] continued until 2005, but to increase profitability, Holden looked to the [[South Korea]]n [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] brand for replacements after acquiring a 44.6% stake in the company in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-02-01]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=9144&vf=1 | title = Spanner in the works | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-07-07}}</ref> Holden had already established close research and design links with Daewoo, with whom it exported the large [[Holden Statesman|Statesman]] model.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-04-18]] | url = http://www.nextcar.com.au/n.daewoo.statesman.05apr.html | title = The Statesman Goes To South Korea | publisher = Next Car | accessdate = 2007-11-25}}</ref> In 2005, the Opel-sourced [[Holden Barina|Barina]] was replaced by the [[Daewoo Kalos]], which continued to be sold under the Barina nameplate.<ref>{{citation | last = Carey | first = John | title = Holden Barina: Korea-built mini goes large on value | year = 2005 | magazine = [[Wheels magazine]]: November 2005 | pages = 131}}</ref> The Viva, based on the [[Daewoo Lacetti]], replaced the entry-level [[Holden Astra]] Classic, although a new Astra launched in 2004 was offered as more of an up-market model.<ref>{{citation | last = Carey | first = John | title = Holden Viva: Better than when it was a Daewoo.

Executives of secondary departments include William Lesner, Alison Terry, Ian McCleave, Tony Hyde, Tony Stolfo, Alan Batey, Rodney Keane, Scott Sandefur, Pierre Matthee, Gene Stefanyshyn, Raymundo Garza, Mark Bernhard, and Fiona Harden.<ref name = "profile"/> Vehicles are sold countrywide through the Holden Dealer Network (310 authorised stores and 12 service centres), which employs more than 13,500 people.<ref name = "profile"/>

Since the 1960s, Holden models have been a staple of domestic [[touring car racing]], and the quasi-factory [[Holden Racing Team]] (HRT) has successfully participated in [[V8 Supercar]] racing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hsv.com.au/racing/2004/history/history.htm | title = Holden Racing Team History | publisher = Holden Special Vehicles | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> In 1987, [[Holden Special Vehicles]] (HSV) was formed in partnership with Tom Walkinshaw, who primarily manufactures modified, high-performance Commodore variants.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hsv.com.au/studentpack/spackhistory.htm | title = HSV History & Background | publisher = Holden Special Vehicles | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> To further reinforce the brand, HSV introduced the [[HSV Dealer Team|Toll HSV Dealer Team]] into the V8 Supercar fold in 2005 under the naming rights of HSV Toll Racing.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-11-21]] | url = http://www.hsvdt.com.au/hsvdt_new/2006/news/toll_hsvdt_release.asp | title = Toll and HSV Dealer Team confirm V8 Supercar alliance | publisher = Toll HSV Dealer Team | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

The logo, or "Holden lion and stone" as it is known, has played a vital role in establishing Holden's identity. In 1928, Holden's Motor Body Builders appointed [[Rayner Hoff]] to design the emblem. The logo refers to a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] fable, in which observations of [[lion]]s rolling stones led to the invention of the wheel. With the 1948 launch of the [[Holden 48-215|48-215]], Holden revised its logo and commissioned another redesign in 1972 to better represent the company.<ref>{{citation | last = Wright | first = John | title = Badgeology | year = 2004 | magazine = [[Wheels magazine]] May 2004 | pages = 152}}</ref> The emblem was reworked once more in 1994.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/history.jsp?link=symbol | title = The Story of the Holden Lion | publisher = GM Holden | accessdate = 2007-07-12}}</ref>

=== Exports ===
Holden first began to export vehicles in 1954, sending the [[Holden FJ|FJ]] to New Zealand. New Zealand is now Holden's largest export market, with the large [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] model toping the sales charts from-time-to-time. To combat declining large car sales in Australia due to rising [[Gasoline usage and pricing|fuel costs]], the reduction of import [[tariff]]s and [[Demographics|demographic]] changes, Holden began to broaden their export potential by catering their full-size Commodore and [[Holden Statesman|Statesman]] models to left-hand drive markets. In [[Brunei]], [[Fiji]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], South Africa, Thailand and parts of the [[Middle East]], Commodores are badged as [[Chevrolet Lumina (Australia)|Chevrolet Luminas]], and in [[Brazil]] as the [[Chevrolet Omega]].<ref name = "2007 exports">{{cite web | date = [[2007-09-09]] | url = http://www.nextcar.com.au/n.holden.2007.brazil.07sep.html | title = GM Holden Celebrates 10th Year of Exports to Brazil | publisher = Next Car | accessdate = 2007-11-25}}</ref> The larger Statesman model is also sold alongside the Lumina in the Middle East as the [[Chevrolet Caprice#2000+ (Middle East)|Chevrolet Caprice]],<ref name = "2007 exports"/> and previously in [[People's Republic of China|China]] as the [[Buick Royaum]], before being replaced by the [[Buick Park Avenue (China)|Park Avenue]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Dornin | first = Tim | date = [[2007-04-11]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleId=37768 | title = Holden to export engines to China | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref>
