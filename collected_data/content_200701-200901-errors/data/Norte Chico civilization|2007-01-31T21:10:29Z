{{History of Peru}}
The '''Norte Chico civilization''' was a complex [[Pre-Columbian]] society that included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the [[Norte Chico]] region of north-central coastal [[Peru]]. It is the oldest known [[civilization]] in the Americas, having flourished between 3000 and 1800 B.C. The ancient culture is sometimes referred to as the Caral-Supe, after [[Caral]] in the Supe Valley, a large and well studied Norte Chico site. In archeological [[nomenclature]], Norte Chico is a Preceramic culture of the Pre-Columbian [[Cultural periods of Peru|Late Archaic]]; it lacked ceramics, writing, and known art. The most dynamic achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Sophisticated [[government]] is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico, and intriguing questions remain over its organization, particularly the impact that food resources had on politics.

Archealogists have been aware of ancient sites in the area since at least the 1940s, with early work at [[Aspero]] on the coast, and later at Caral further inland.<ref name=Polities>{{cite journal | last = Haas | first = Jonathon | coauthors = Winifred Creamer, Alvaro Ruiz | date = 2005 | title = Power and the Emergence of Complex Polities in the Peruvian Preceramic | journal = Archaeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 37-52 | accessdate = 2007-01-31}}</ref> A 2001 paper in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'', extensively documenting Caral,<ref name=Caral>{{cite journal | last = Shady Solis | first = Ruth | coauthors = Jonathon Haas, Winifred Creamer | date = 27 April 2001 | title = Dating Caral, a Preceramic Site in the Supe Valley on the Central Coast of Peru  | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5517 | pages = 723-726  | doi = 10.1126/science.1059519 | accessdate = 2007-01-31}}</ref> and a 2004 ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' piece, describing fieldwork and [[radiocarbon dating]] across a wider area,<ref name=Dating>{{cite journal | last = Haas | first = Jonathon | coauthors = Winifred Creamer, Alvaro Ruiz | date = 23 December 2004 | title = Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru | journal = Nature | volume = 432 | issue = | pages = 1020-1023  | doi = 10.1038/nature03146 | accessdate = 2007-01-31}}</ref> would reveal Norte Chico's full significance and lead to widespread attention. The great age of the civilization is particularly remarkable: complex society in Norte Chico emerged just a millenium after [[Sumer]], was contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]], and predates the [[Mesoamerican]] [[Olmec]] by nearly two millenia. 

==History and geography==

Andean Peru has been recognized as one of six global areas that saw the indigenous development of [[civilization]], and one of two, along with Mesoamerica, in the Western Hemisphere.<ref name=Dating/> Norte Chico has pushed back the horizon for complex societies in the Peruvian region by two millenia. The [[Chavín culture]], circa 900 B.C., had long been considered the first civilization of the area and is still regularly cited as such in general works.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa91 |title=History of Peru |accessdate=2007-01-31 |work=HISTORYWORLD }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=J.M. |title=The New Penguin History of the World |edition=Fourth | year=2004 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn= |pages= |chapter= |quote= [The Americas] are millenia behind the development of civilization elsewhere, whatever the cause of that may be.}} The implied laggardness appears disproven by Norte Chico; Mann is sharply critical of the inattention provided the Pre-Columbian Americas in his work.</ref>

The discovery of Norte Chico has also shifted the focus of research away from the highland areas of the Andes (where the Chavín, and later [[Inca]], had their major centers) to the Peruvian [[littoral]], or coastal regions. Norte Chico is located in a central area of the coast, roughly bounded by the [[Lurin Valley]] on the south and the [[Casma Valley]] on the north. It comprises four coastal valleys, the Huaura, Supe, Pativilca, and Fortaleza;  known sites are concentrated in the latter three, which share a common coastal plain. The three principal valleys cover only 1,800 km2 in total area, and research has emphasized the density of the population centers.<ref name=Polities/>

The radiocarbon work of Haas et al., found that 10 of 95 samples taken in the Pativilca and Fortaleza areas dated prior to 3500 B.C.; the oldest, dated to 9210 B.C., provides "limited indication" of human settlement during the Pre-Columbian Early Archaic era. Two dates of 3700 B.C. are associated with communal agriculture, but are likely anamolous. It is from 3200 B.C. onward that large scale human settlement and communal construction are clearly apparent.<ref name=Dating/> Mann, in his survey of the literature, suggests "sometime before 3200 B.C., and possibly before 3500 B.C." as the beginning date of the Norte Chico flourishing. He notes that the earliest date "securely associated" with a city is 3500 B.C., at Huaricanga, in the Fortaleza area of the north.
