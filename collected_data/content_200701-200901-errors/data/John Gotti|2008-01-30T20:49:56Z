'''John Joseph Gotti, Jr.''' ([[October 27]], [[1940]] &ndash; [[June 10]], [[2002]]), commonly known as '''John Gotti,''' also nicknamed by the [[Mass media|media]] as '''The Dapper Don''' and '''The Teflon Don''', was a [[crime boss|boss]] of the [[Gambino Crime Family]], one of the [[Five Families]] in [[New York City]]. He became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style that made him the poster child for mobsters, an image that persists even today. 

He was convicted of [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|racketeering]], 13 [[murder]]s, [[obstruction of justice]], [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder, [[illegal gambling]], [[extortion]], [[tax evasion]] and [[loansharking]] among others and sentenced to life in prison where he died.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
John Joseph "Johnny Boy" Gotti Jr. was born [[October 27]], 1940 to John Gotti Sr. and Philomena "Fannie" Gotti. He was the fifth child of thirteen, two of whom died in infancy. [[John Gotti Sr.]] was born in New Jersey to Carmine Gotti, an immigrant from the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] section of [[Italy]]. He and his wife struggled to make ends meet and raised their children in a low-income section of the South Bronx. When Gotti was twelve, his family moved to [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]], a very tough and dangerous neighborhood.

As a young boy, Gotti had to fight often as was common in that neighborhood, and he became a rough street fighter that ran errands for the local wiseguys. Gotti focused more on his street education and less on his formal one. He was constantly absent from school and when he was there he was labeled the class bully. He was such a routine discipline problem that the school showed very little interest in his truancy.

With his brothers [[Peter Gotti|Peter]] and [[Richard V. Gotti|Richard]] he became part of a local street gang. 
In the early summer of 1954, Gotti and a few other hoods participated in a robbery of a construction site. While trying to steal a cement mixer, the mixer tipped over, crushing Gotti's toes. He spent most of the summer in the hospital.

When Gotti was sixteen he quit school for good and joined the Fulton-Rockaway Boys, a local teenage gang that stole automobiles, fenced stolen goods, and rolled drunks. It was at this moment in his life where he teamed up with [[Angelo Ruggiero|Angelo "Quack-Quack" Ruggiero]] and [[Wilfred Johnson|Wilfred "Willy Boy" Johnson]].

During his time with the Fulton-Rockaway Boys, Gotti was arrested five times. All the charges were eventually dismissed or reduced to probationary sentences.

===Family=== 	 
In 1960, Gotti met a Jewish-American girl Victoria  "Angel" DiGiorgio, who gave birth to his children [[Victoria Gotti]], [[John A. Gotti]], [[Frank Gotti]], and Peter Gotti, Jr., named after his uncle [[Peter Gotti]]. John and his family lived on 85th Street in [[Howard Beach, New York|Howard Beach]]. In 1980 his son Frank was accidentally knocked down and killed by neighbor John Favara's car. Although the death was viewed as accidental by the authorities, Favara later disappeared and was rumored to have been cut in half with a chainsaw and his body disposed of. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E5DB1239F932A05752C0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=6 The Don Is Done]</ref>

According to numerous sources, Gotti had three illegitimate children, Annabella "Anna" Gotti, Lidianna "Linsay" Gotti, and Paul "Paulie" Gotti as the result of a longtime affair with Staten Island housewife [[Shannon Connelly|Shannon "Sandy" Connelly]], the wife of a Gambino soldier, [[Ed Grillo]].<ref>http://chicagosyndicate.blogspot.com/2006_02_26_archive.html</ref>. After Shannon's murder in 1974, Gotti and his wife DiGiorgio had the guardianship of Annabella and Lidianna. Paul Gotti lives with his son, Terenzio "Teddy" Gotti.

===Career===
After his marriage, Gotti tried working legitimate careers. He worked as a coat factory presser and a truck driver's assistant, but he was always drawn back to a life of crime.

In 1963, Gotti and [[Salvatore Ruggiero]] were arrested by police for being in an automobile that had been reported stolen from a rental car agency. Gotti spent twenty days in jail. Around this time Gotti was arrested often, mostly on petty crimes such as [[larceny]], [[burglary]], and [[bookmaking]]. 

In 1966, he spent several months in jail for an attempted theft. In 1966, Gotti also became an associate for a crew headed by [[Carmine Fatico]] who worked for [[Aniello Dellacroce]], underboss of the Gambino Crime Family.

Gotti's criminal career with the Gambinos began with fencing stolen goods from [[Idlewild Airport]] out of the [[Bergin Hunt and Fish Club]] in [[Ozone Park, Queens]]. Gotti became successful enough at this lifestyle to move his family to a nicer apartment in Brooklyn.
On November 27, 1967, Gotti and Angelo Ruggiero forged the name of a forwarding company agent and then took a rented truck to JFK's United cargo area and drove off with $30,000 worth of merchandise. A few days later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] began surveillance on Angelo and Gotti and caught them loading up more goods, this time at Northwest Airlines cargo terminal. Once outside the terminal Gotti's brother [[Gene Gotti|Gene]] pulled alongside Gotti's truck and they began to transfer the goods. The FBI swooped in and arrested all three men and found Gotti hiding in the rear of the truck behind some boxes.

In February 1968, United employees identified Gotti as the man who signed for the earlier stolen merchandise.  The FBI arrested him for the United hijacking soon after. Two months later, while out on bail, Gotti was arrested a third-time for hijacking--this time stealing a load of cigarettes worth $500,000 on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. Fatico urged Gotti to hire defense attorney [[Michael Coiro]]. Later that year Gotti pled guilty to the Northwest hijacking and was sentenced to four years at [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary]]. Prosecutors dropped the charges for the cigarette hijacking. Gotti also pleaded guilty to the United hijacking. Gotti spent less than three years at Lewisburg.

After he was released from prison he was placed on probation and ordered to find a legitimate job. Gotti was placed on the payroll of his wife's stepfather's construction company where he reportedly never showed up for work but remained on the payroll.  Meanwhile he returned to his old crew at the Bergin club still working under Fatico. When Fatico was indicted on loansharking charges, he used Gotti to oversee the day-to-day activities at the club. This helped get the attention of the Gambinos, specifically of Dellacroce, and, at the age of thirty-one, Gotti became acting [[Caporegime|capo]].  Gotti owned a Queens flea market with [[Genovese crime family]] wiseguys [[Joseph Galizia|Joseph "Joe Glitz" Galizia]] and [[Carlo DiPietro|Carlo "Collie" DiPietro]], eventually Gotti and Galizia decided they wanted DiPietro out of the business, and Galizia killed DiPietro.  

Dellacroce and Gotti were great friends from the beginning with much in common: They were both fierce, tough, street-wise,  and clever. This friendship brought Gotti close to boss [[Carlo Gambino]] who ran the organization until his death in 1976 when [[Paul Castellano]] took over.
	
Gotti's crew, however, was caught selling [[heroin]], against the rules of the family, and were to be disbanded, and maybe killed.  Gotti and others in his crew organized the shooting of the Gambino family boss, [[Paul Castellano]], on [[December 16]], [[1985]]. Castellano was shot six times, along with his [[bodyguard]], Thomas Bilotti, outside [[Sparks Steak House]] in Manhattan and Gotti took control of the family.

Following his purported ascension to the top position of the Gambino family, Gotti became known as "The Dapper Don," appearing in public wearing $10,000 hand-tailored [[Brioni]] suits and reveling in media attention. Gotti was extremely popular in his Queens neighborhood, where he organized free lavish street parties and festivals, and had a reputation for keeping [[street crime]] out. He also hosted the annual [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] near his Bergin Hunt and Fish Club in Ozone Park, a neighborhood in [[Queens]], which featured an elaborate fireworks display and became a major media event. 

Gotti was arrested several times throughout his career, and although he served time in both state and federal prison (including a [[manslaughter]] conviction in connection with the shooting death of a low-level [[Irish-American]] gangster who had kidnapped and killed Carlo Gambino's nephew, named James McBratney in a tavern on [[Staten Island]] in 1973), in the 1980s he was referred to by the media as the "Teflon Don" as he avoided conviction on racketeering and assault charges (they didn't stick). Gotti bribed or threatened [[jury|jurors]] in several trials. He also made use of police [[informant]]s to keep a step ahead of investigators. 		 
Gotti became something of a celebrity, and would frequently shake hands and pose for pictures with tourists outside the [[Ravenite Social Club]] in Manhattan, where he conducted business. Gotti conducted popular Fourth of July fireworks displays with free food distributed to the neighborhood on holidays such as the 4th, Thanksgiving and Christmas. Gotti's son was supposed to be responsible for the shooting of a radio talk show host for "bad-mouthing" Gotti. However, many feel the shooting was retaliation for a vicious beating of a showgirl who worked at mob-connected "Show-world," run by "John Moschetto," who had dated Gotti (A Captain in the Gambinos murdered by [[Sammy Gravano]]), by a vigilante group connected with that individual.

===The last trial===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Gottiincourt.jpg|thumb|right|The Dapper Don in court]] -->
Gotti was long under intense electronic surveillance run by the FBI. His club, phones, and other places of business were all bugged. To get around this, he held meetings while walking down the street and played loud tapes of white noise. Eventually the FBI caught him on tape in an apartment above the club discussing a number of murders and other criminal activities. The FBI also caught Gotti denigrating his underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore "Sammy The Bull" Gravano]]. 

On December 11, 1990, FBI agents and New York City detectives raided the Ravenite Social Club and arrested Gotti, Gravano, [[Frank Locascio]], and [[Thomas Gambino]] 
Gotti was charged with 13 counts of murder, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder, loansharking, racketeering, obstruction of justice, illegal gambling, tax evasion, and, for the first time, he was charged with the murders of Paul Castellano and Thomas Bilotti.

Gotti was tried in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] before the Honorable [[I. Leo Glasser]]. The federal prosecutor's evidence was overwhelming. Not only did they have Gotti on tape, they also had several witnesses to testify against Gotti. [[Phil Leonetti|Philip Leonetti]], former underboss of the Philadelphia Crime Family was prepared to testify that Gotti bragged to Philadelphia crime leaders that he had ordered Castellano's execution. Prosecutors also persuaded Gravano to testify against his boss with the promise of being entered into the [[Witness Protection Program]]. On [[April 2]] [[1992]], after only 13 hours of deliberation, the jury found Gotti guilty on all 13 charges.<ref>http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/don_24.html</ref>

During the trial, crowds gathered outside the courthouse to lend support to Gotti, and the court was filled with spectators including [[Peter Gotti]], [[John "Jackie Nose" D'Amico]], and celebrities like singer [[Jay Black]] and actor [[Mickey Rourke]].

===Prison===		 
On [[June 23]], 1992, Judge Glasser sentenced Gotti to life imprisonment without possibility of parole.[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/don_24.html?sect=15] It was assumed that Gotti would serve his sentence at the new federal "[[supermax]]" [[ADX Florence|facility]] at [[Florence, Colorado]], but instead he was sent to the older [[USP Marion|United States Penitentiary at Marion, Illinois]], where he was kept in a cell 23 hours a day. His cell was underground and measured eight feet by seven feet. He was allowed out of his cell one hour per day for solitary exercise in a concrete-walled enclosure. He was allowed two showers per week and one radio and a small black and white T.V. set in his cell. Meals were delivered to his cell through a slot in the door. In other words, he was in virtual solitary confinement.  (This is standard procedure for all inmates in the restricted units at this [[Supermax]] Federal Prison.)  While in Marion he had been confined along with convicted spies [[Jonathan Pollard]] and [[Christopher Boyce]]. Four days after John Gotti was imprisoned at Marion, his father John Gotti Sr. died of heart failure at the age of eighty-five.

===Death===	
Gotti died of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] at 12:45 p.m. on [[June 10]], [[2002]] at the [[Medical_Center_for_Federal_Prisoners%2C_Springfield|United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]], where he had been transferred once the cancer was diagnosed. His family claimed he had not received proper care in jail and that faulty dental work had aggravated the disease. Gotti was not allowed to die in hospital, but was kept in his cell.  When his daughter and family came for a visit while he was in hospital, in his last days, and unable to speak, they were still not allowed a contact visit, but were kept behind a screen.  Following his death, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn]] announced that Gotti's family would not be permitted to have a [[Requiem|Mass of Christian Burial]] for Gotti. The church said that Gotti's family would be allowed to have a [[Mass for the Dead]] for Gotti only after he had been buried. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] had taken similar action against other organized crime figures  such as  [[Paul Castellano]]; but unlike Castellano, Gotti's family was permitted to have him buried in the mausoleum at [[Saint John's Cemetery, Queens|Saint John's Cemetery]] in Queens, next to his son Frank Gotti. <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= John Gotti Dies in Prison at 61; Mafia Boss Relished the Spotlight |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E4DC1E3DF932A25755C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |quote=John J.

He was 61. ... Mr. Gotti asked Mr. Dellacroce to intervene with Mr. Castellano, but before any resolution was made, Mr. Dellacroce died of cancer in December 1985. Two weeks later, on the evening of Dec. 16, 1985, Mr. Castellano and his new underboss, Thomas Billotti, were gunned down by a team of assassins in front of Sparks Steak House on East 46th Street near Third Avenue in Manhattan. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=June 11, 2002 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref>

Another Mad Magazine article, "Scruples Questions We Would Like to See", features Gotti being asked a question from the board game [[Scruples]]: ''"Your best friend asks you to borrow $2,000 for one year. Do you charge interest?"''

===Film===

He is also mentioned by [[Junior Soprano|Corrado "Junior" Soprano]] in an episode where he says ''Gotti knew how to choose sides'', referring to the situation between Gotti and his boss [[Paul Castellano]].

===Music=== 

Due to his infamy as a New York City crime boss and the ease of rhyming his surname, John Gotti is referenced very frequently in [[hip hop]] music as an icon and role model for inner-city drug dealers and criminals who aspire to achieve his level of power, notoriety and financial success, and the street respect that comes with it[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1145372].  The following are just a few examples of Gotti references in hip hop lyrics and culture:

*Hip hop record company executive [[Irv Gotti]] derives his stage name as a combination of his birth name "Irving" and "Gotti" in reference to the mob boss John Gotti.
