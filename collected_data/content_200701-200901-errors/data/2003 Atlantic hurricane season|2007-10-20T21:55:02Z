<!-- Created with subst: of [[Template:Hurricane season single]]. -->The '''2003 Atlantic hurricane season''' officially began on [[June 1]], [[2003]], and lasted until [[November 30]], [[2003]]. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most [[tropical cyclone]]s form in the [[Atlantic basin]], although the season technically lasted from [[April 20]] to [[December 11]] due to out-of-season storm activity caused by [[Tropical Storm Ana (2003)|Tropical Storms Ana]] and [[Tropical Storm Peter (2003)|Peter]].

The season was tied for the sixth most active on record, behind the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933]], [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995]], [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887]], and [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969]] seasons, and tied with the [[1936 Atlantic hurricane season|1936 season]]. Two unusual events happened in the 2003 season. The first was the formation of [[Tropical Storm Ana (2003)|Tropical Storm Ana]], the first Atlantic tropical storm on record to form in April. The other was the December formation of [[Tropical Storm Odette (2003)|Tropical Storms Odette]] and [[Tropical Storm Peter (2003)|Peter]], making 2003 the first time two Atlantic tropical storms formed in December since the [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season]].

Other notable storms include [[Hurricane Fabian]], [[Hurricane Isabel]], and [[Hurricane Juan]]. Fabian struck [[Bermuda]] as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] hurricane, the first direct hit since 1926, causing $300 million in damage. Isabel, which reached [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] strength, made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]], causing widespread damage across the Mid-Atlantic amounting to $3.7 billion with 16 direct deaths. Lastly, Juan caused considerable destruction to [[Nova Scotia]], particularly [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], as a Category 2 hurricane, the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since 1893. All three names were retired.

{{hurricane main|Tropical Storm Ana (2003)}}

Ana formed as a [[subtropical storm]] on [[April 20]] as a non-tropical low, and began taking on tropical characteristics. By [[April 21]], Subtropical Storm Ana had developed a warm core and was designated a tropical storm. By [[April 24]] it had become [[extratropical]], and was absorbed by a frontal system near [[Portugal]] two days later.  It was the only Atlantic storm ever to have formed in April in recorded history. A subtropical storm in the [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season]] was the first recorded tropical or subtropical cyclone in April, although there have likely been other cyclones that were undetected. <ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003ana.shtml?

Tropical Storm Bill developed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[June 29]] to the north of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. It slowly organized as it moved northward, and reached a peak of 60&nbsp;[[mph]] (95 [[km/h]]) shortly before making landfall 27&nbsp;miles (43&nbsp;km) west of [[Chauvin, Louisiana|Chauvin]], [[Louisiana]]. Bill quickly weakened over land, and as it accelerated to the northeast, moisture from the storm, combined with cold air from an approaching [[surface weather analysis|cold front]], produced an outbreak of 34&nbsp;[[tornado]]es.

{{hurricane main|Hurricane Claudette (2003)}}
The system that became Claudette was recognized as a tropical depression near the [[Windward Islands]] on [[July 7]]. By [[July 11]], Claudette had reached the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. A few hours after landfall at [[Puerto Morelos]], Claudette emerged over the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Claudette would restrengthen, and made landfall a second time on [[July 15]] at [[Matagorda Island]] near [[Port O'Connor, Texas]] as a strong Category 1 storm. After its final landfall, Claudette remained at tropical storm strength for more than a day, an unusual occurrence. Most tropical systems weaken rapidly after landfall, as they are separated from the warm waters that power them.

Claudette was responsible for one direct death, from a falling tree. Inland towns in Texas, such as [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]] sustained significant wind damage. Estimated US damage was $180 million. No significant damage was reported from [[Mexico]].<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003claudette.shtml?|Claudette Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>

Hurricane Danny was named on [[July 17]] in the open ocean east of [[Bermuda]] from a tropical wave. Initially expected to remain a tropical depression, Danny began the northeastward leg of an anti-cyclonic loop around an area of high pressure in the central Atlantic, and strengthened over unusually favorable conditions in the north Atlantic for July. The storm reached hurricane strength on [[July 19]], but weakened 24 hours later over the cool waters of the north Atlantic. By [[July 21]] Danny had lost its identity as a tropical cyclone.

{{hurricane main|Hurricane Erika (2003)}}
Hurricane Erika formed out of a non-tropical low first spotted 1000 nm east of Bermuda on [[August 9]]. As it approached Florida on [[August 14]], the low began taking on tropical characteristics, and almost developed a closed circulation. When the low emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, the presence of a fully closed circulation and active convection resulted in a classification as Tropical Storm Erika. A high pressure system over the southern United States caused Erika to move quickly westerward. On [[August 16]], Erika's motion slowed and the storm intensified. Landfall was at the Mexican town of [[Boca San Rafael]], about 40 miles (65 km) south of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]].

Erika was not classified as a hurricane while active. A post-storm analysis of radar data revealed sustained hurricane force winds just before landfall, and the storm was upgraded after the fact.

Erika was responsible for two deaths due to flooding in Mexico. Large amounts of flood-related damage were reported in north-eastern Mexico. Minor coastal damage and beach erosion occurred in South [[Texas]]. [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003erika.shtml?] Damage was limited to one building experiencing roof damage, with total damage in Texas amounting to $10,000 (2003 USD). <ref>[http://maestro.srcc.lsu.edu/softlib/sd/sd0308.pdf Maestro Damage Report for Erika]</ref><ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003erika.shtml Erika Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>

{{hurricane main|Hurricane Fabian}}
Fabian was a powerful [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] that formed in late August in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved generally west-northwestward, peaking at 145 mph before turning to the northwest. On [[September 5]], Fabian hit [[Bermuda]] at Category 3 strength. Although it was not technically a landfall, Fabian's eyewall passed directly over the island, causing severe damage. The hurricane continued to the northeast, became extratropical on [[September 8]], and dissipated on the 9th in the north Atlantic. Fabian was responsible for eight deaths, and caused an estimated 300 million (2003 USD) in damage to Bermuda, making it the worst Bermuda hurricane since 1926. Because of its destruction, the name was retired after this season, and will be replaced by Fred in 2009. <ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003fabian.shtml Fabian Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>

Tropical Storm Grace formed from a disturbance in the central Gulf of Mexico on [[August 30]]. Grace was an ill-defined storm which formed a second circulation center. The second, stronger center moved onshore near [[San Luis Pass]] at the western end of [[Galveston Island]] on [[August 31]]. The storm quickly weakened and merged with a frontal system in eastern [[Oklahoma]] on [[September 2]]. While Grace was responsible for heavy rainfall along the Texas coast, damage was minor and totaled to $113,000 (2003 USD).

{{hurricane main|Tropical Storm Henri (2003)}}
Henri formed from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico on [[September 5]]. Under the influence of a mid-latitude trough, it moved eastward. Despite strong wind shear, Henri's winds  quickly increased to 60 mph, but fell off to 30 kt before landfall as a tropical depression near [[Clearwater, Florida]]. It crossed the state, and dissipated on the 9th off the North Carolina coast due to vertical shear. The extratropical remnant moved northward, and moved inland on September 12.

Henri was responsible for up to 10 inches of rainfall across Florida, but damage was minimal. The remnants of Henri caused heavy flooding across the Mid-Atlantic of up to 10 inches. In [[Delaware]], 194 homes were damaged from the flooding. The rainfall caused rivers to exceed flood stage, including the Red Clay Creek in Delaware which peaked at 17.27 feet. Damage totaled to $19.5 million (2003 USD), though no deaths occurred. <ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003henri.shtml Henri Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>

{{hurricane main|Hurricane Isabel}}
A tropical wave off the coast of Africa was named Tropical Storm Isabel on [[September 6]]. The storm moved westward and intensified to hurricane strength. By [[September 11]], Isabel had reached Category 5 strength, with winds of 165 mi/h. Isabel would remain at or near Category 5 for 5 days while moving west-northwest across the Atlantic. On [[September 15]], as Isabel approached the [[Bahamas]], vertical wind shear increased, and Isabel began to weaken. Now on a more northern track, Isabel made landfall near [[Drum Inlet, North Carolina]] on [[September 18]] at Category 2 strength. Isabel remained a hurricane until it reached southern Virginia, and was eventually absorbed by a larger system over far northern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], near [[James Bay]], maintaining at least tropical storm intensity for most of the way up.

Isabel was directly responsible for 16 deaths, 10 in Virginia. Indirect deaths were more numerous, with 35 people losing their lives across nine states, the District of Columbia and Canada. Widespread damage was reported, most in Virginia and not in North Carolina as one would expect. Total damages were estimated at $3.37 billion, with two-thirds of that total applying to Virginia. <div style="clear: both"></div> <ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>

A tropical wave off of Africa became a Tropical Depression on [[September 8]], about 290 miles (465 km) southeast of the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. It had a maximum strength of 35 mph, and minimum pressure of 1007 mbar. This depression was forecast to become a tropical storm for some of its life, and was even projected to become a minimal hurricane when it first formed. However, an upper level low created shear from the south, which caused it to dissipate on [[September 10]].<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003fourteen.shtml Fourteen Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>{{clear}}

A westward moving tropical wave developed a weak low pressure system to the east of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] on [[September 27]]. It moved westward, and became associated with a cold front. An extratropical storm formed late on [[September 30]], and while drifting over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, it became Tropical Storm Larry on [[October 1]]. A strong ridge of high pressure from Florida to Texas prevented any northward motion, leaving Larry to nearly stall. Larry meandered slowly southward, steadily strengthening to a 65 mph tropical storm. The storm made landfall in [[Tabasco]] near Paraiso on the 6th, and dissipated later that day. The remnant low crossed over into the Pacific where it dissipated on [[October 7]]. Five deaths were officially reported, due to inland flooding. <ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003larry.shtml Larry Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>

{{hurricane main|Tropical Storm Mindy (2003)}}
A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[October 1]], and tracking westward it began to organize after entering the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Despite strong southwesterly wind shear, a closed surface circulation developed over eastern [[Hispaniola]], and late on [[October 10]] the system developed into Tropical Storm Mindy just off the northern coast of [[Dominican Republic]]; upon forming, the storm reached its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h). Strong vertical [[wind shear]] weakened the storm greatly, and after it turned to the northeast Mindy dissipated on [[October 14]] about 445 miles (715 km) south-southwest of [[Bermuda]].<ref name="mindytcr">{{cite web|author=Miles B.

{{hurricane main|Tropical Storm Nicholas (2003)}}
Forming from a [[tropical wave]] on [[October 13]] in the central tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]], Nicholas slowly developed due to moderate levels of wind shear throughout its lifetime. Deep convection slowly organized, and Nicholas attained a peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) on [[October 17]]. After moving west-northwestward for much of its lifetime, it turned northward and weakened due to increasing shear. The storm again turned to the west and briefly restrengthened, but after turning again to the north Nicholas transitioned to an [[extratropical]] cyclone on [[October 24]]. As an extratropical storm, Nicholas executed a large loop to the west, and after moving erratically for a week and organizing into a tropical low, it was absorbed by a non-tropical low. The low continued westward, crossed [[Florida]], and ultimately dissipated over the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]] on [[November 5]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Nicholas Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-10-13|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003nicholas.shtml?}}</ref>

Nicholas had no impact as a tropical cyclone, and impact from the low that absorbed the storm was limited to rainfall, gusty winds, and rough surf.<Ref name="surfline">{{Cite web|author=Sean Collins|year=2003|title=Wavetraks November Newsletter|publisher=Surfline Forecast Team|accessdate=2006-10-14|url=http://www.surfline.com/newsletter/December03.html}}</ref> The low that absorbed the storm nearly developed into a tropical cyclone, which would have been called Odette.

{{hurricane main|Tropical Storm Odette (2003)}}
Odette was a rare December tropical storm (the first since [[Hurricane Lili (1984)|Hurricane Lili]] in 1984) that formed on [[December 4]], days after the official end of hurricane season. Odette strengthened and made landfall near [[Cabo Falso]] in the Dominican Republic on [[December 6]] as a moderately strong tropical storm. A day later, Odette became extratropical, and eventually merged with a cold front.

Eight deaths were directly attributed to this tropical storm in the [[Dominican Republic]] due to mudslides or flash flooding. In addition, two deaths were indirectly caused by the storm. Approximately 35% of the nation's [[banana]] crop was destroyed. Fortunately, little damage occurred in [[Haiti]]. <ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003odette.shtml Odette Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>

{{hurricane main|Tropical Storm Peter (2003)}}
Peter was a short-lived storm, primarily notable for being the second December storm of the season, the first time this has occurred since the [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887 season]]. It is also notable for being only the second storm to reach the 'P' name since naming began in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in [[1950]], and one of only three storms total to do this. The other storms were [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Pablo|Pablo]] in the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995 season]] and [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Philippe|Philippe]] in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]].

Peter formed as a subtropical storm on [[December 7]] from an extratropical gale. By [[December 9]], Peter had become a strong tropical storm, nearly reaching hurricane strength. The organization would not last, as Peter became an extratropical low on [[December 11]] and was absorbed by a cold front. No deaths or damages are associated with Peter. The formation of Peter made 2003 the busiest season since [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995]]. <ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003peter.shtml? Peter Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>

The table on the right shows the [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|ACE]] for each storm in the season. The ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed for, so hurricanes that lasted a long time (such as [[Hurricane Isabel|Isabel]] and [[Hurricane Fabian|Fabian]]) have higher ACEs. Isabel was one of the very few hurricanes since 1950 to have an ACE of over 50 10<sup>4</sup> kt<sup>2</sup>.<ref>[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html ACE Data Per Storm]</ref>
