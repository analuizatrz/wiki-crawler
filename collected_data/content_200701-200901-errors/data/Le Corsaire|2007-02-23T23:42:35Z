'''''Le Corsaire''''' ('''''The Pirate''''') is a [[ballet]] in three acts, with a libretto based on the poem ''[[The Corsair]]'' by [[Lord Byron]]. Originally choreographed by the Balletmaster [[Joseph Mazilier]] to the music of [[Adolphe Adam]]. First presented by the [[Académie Royale de Musique|Ballet of the Académie Royale de Musique]], [[Paris, France]] on [[23 January]] [[1856]]. The ballet has many celebrated passages which are often extracted and performed independently - the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'', the ''Pas d'Esclave'', and the ''Grand Pas de Trois des Odalisques''. The most celebrated is the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', which is among classical ballet's most iconic and performed excerpts.

The ballet has been much revised throughout its long and complex performance history by way of later stagings in [[Russia]], most notably by [[Jules Perrot]] (1858), [[Marius Petipa]] (1858, 1863, 1868, 1885, and 1899), [[Alexander Gorsky]] (1912), [[Agrippina Vaganova]] (1931), [[Pyotr Gusev]] (1955), [[Konstantin Sergeyev]] (1972, 1992), and [[Yuri Grigorovich]] (1994).

During the mid to late 19th century  [[Adolphe Adam]]'s score acquired a substantial amount of additional music, and by the turn of the 20th century the score credited contributions from six different composers: [[Cesare Pugni]], [[House of Oldenburg|Grand Duke Peter II of Oldenburg]] (AKA Prince Oldenburg or Prince Peter Von Oldenburg), [[Léo Delibes]], [[Léon Minkus]], [[Prince Nikita Trubetskoi]], and [[Riccardo Drigo]] (often not all of these composers are credited). Many Soviet-era revivals added new music as well, though the majority of such additions were extracted from ballets from the Imperial-era that were no longer being performed.

Today ''Le Corsaire'' is performed chiefly in two different versions - in [[Russia]] and parts of Europe (mostly eastern Europe) companies have mounted productions derived from [[Pyotr Gusev]]'s 1955 revival, initially staged for the [[Maly Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Ballet of the Maly Theatre]] of St. Petersburg, and later the [[Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet]] in 1977. Outside of [[Russia]] and Europe -  primarily in North America and some parts of western Europe - many companies have mounted productions derived from [[Konstantin Sergeyev]]'s revival, initially staged for the [[Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet]] in 1973, and later the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] in 1992.

== The Birth of ''Le Corsaire'' ==

The first [[ballet]] adaptation of [[Lord Byron]]'s 1814 poem ''[[The Corsair]]'' was mounted by the Balletmaster [[Ferdinand Albert Decombè|Ferdinand/Francois Albert Decombè]] to the music of [[Nicholas Bochsa]] for the ballet of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane/King's Theatre]] in 1837, a production which was revived in 1844 quite successfully.

A second ballet adaptation of ''The Corsair'' proved to be among the most celebrated and enduring ballets ever created, first presented on January 23, 1856 at the [[Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique]] (AKA the ''Paris Opéra'') by the [[Académie Royale de Musique|Ballet of the Académie Royale de Musique]] (today known as the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]). The work was the brainchild of the ''Minister of State'', then director of the Opèra, and of the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] of [[France]], who wanted to create a ballet adaptation of [[Lord Byron]]'s poem superior to the one mounted in [[London]] by [[Ferdinand Albert Decombe|Decombè]].

The choreographer for this production was the Paris Opéra's chief Balletmaster [[Joseph Mazilier]], one of the most celebrated choreographers of his time, who was highly skilled in producing the full-length narrative ballets then in vogue, with many successes to his credit (including ''[[Le Diable à Quatre (ballet)|Le Diable à Quatre ]]'' in 1845, and ''[[Paquita]]'' in 1846). As was standard practice in 19th century ballet, a literary man was commissioned to write the libretto, and here Mazilier looked to the most celebrated dramatist available, [[Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges]], who fashioned the scenario loosely based on Byron's poem (Verno crafted the scenarios for many ballets throughout his life, most notably ''[[Giselle]]'' in collaboration with [[Théophile Gautier]] in 1841, and later for [[Marius Petipa|Petipa's]] ''[[The Pharaoh's Daughter]]'' in 1862). 

''Le Corsaire'' was created primarily for the talents of the famous Italian ballerina [[Carolina Rosati]], who was then the Paris Opéra's reigning ''Prima'', celebrated for her great beauty, strong ''pointes'', clean ''batterie'', precision of execution, and easily intelligible [[mime artist|mime]]. The score was commissioned, for a phenomenal fee of 6,000 [[franc]]s in addition to royalties, from [[Adolphe Adam]], who at that time was the most distinguished composer writing for both the ballet and the [[opera]] in France (Adam is most noted for his score for the opera ''[[Les Toréadors]]'' -1849, his score for the ballet ''[[Giselle]]'' -1841, and as his famous [[Christmas carol]] ''[[O Holy Night]]'' -1847). The libretto for ''Le Corsaire'' went through many changes during the long months of the ballet's preparation, requiring Vernoy to be paid an additional 3,000 francs for the work. 

''Le Corsaire'' premiered to a resounding success, with Rosati's powerful interpretation of the heroine Medora becoming the rage of Paris. The stage effects were hailed as the best yet seen on the stage of the Paris Opéra. Designed and executed by the master machinist [[Victor Sacré]], they became immortalized  by [[Gustave Doré]]'s drawing of the ship-wreck from the third act. In attendance for the first three performances were [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]] and his wife, the Empress Eugénie, who had played a large part in the work's gestation. So moved by ''Le Corsaire'' was the Empress that she exclaimed ''"In all my life I have never seen, and probably never shall see again, anything so beautiful or so moving."''.

Adam's score was highly praised for its melodiousness, orchestration, and dramatic intensity. It was to be the composer's last work; - he died of a heart attack on [[May 3]], [[1856]], nearly four months after the ballet's premiere. On the evening of the day of his death, ''Le Corsaire'' was given at the Paris Opéra as a memoriam to him, and in attendance was the royal family with their guest of honor, [[William I of Württemberg|King William I of Württemberg]]. As equally moved by the ballet as was the Empress Eugénie, the Emperor Napoleon III gave orders that all of the evening's box office receipts be given to the composer's widow. 

''Le Corsaire'' was given 43 performances in 1856 alone at the Paris Opéra with only Rosati as Medora. Her interpretation of Medora was considered by all to be incomparable, and after her departure from Paris in 1859 the ballet was taken out of the repertory. Not long afterwards Mazilier retired.

== 'Le Corsaire' in Russia ==
===Petipa and Perrot's revival of 1858===

''Le Corsaire'' was first staged in Russia by the great [[Ballet Master]] [[Jules Perrot]] for the [[Imperial Ballet]] (today known as the [[Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet]]), premiering January 12/24 ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]/[[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendar dates), [[1858]] at the [[Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre]] (it is important to note that until 1886 the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was the principal venue of both the Imperial Ballet and Opera). The production was mounted especially for the Ballerina [[Ekaterina Friedbürg]] with the young [[Marius Petipa]] as Conrad. For this production Perrot essentially restaged Mazilier's original choreography, while Petipa, who also assisted in mounting the work, refashioned some of the original dances, among them, the ''Pas de Éventails'' of Act I (in which Medora and 6 ''coryphèes'' create a "peacock effect" with large fans), and the ''Scéne de Seduction''.

'''The Pas d'esclave''' -

For the 1858 production of ''Le Corsaire'' Petipa interpolated a [[pas de deux]], taken from his 1857 ballet ''[[The Rose, the Violet, and the Butterfly]]'', a work set to the music of [[House of Oldenburg|Grand Duke Peter II of Oldenburg]] (AKA Prince Oldenburg or Prince Peter Von Oldenburg). This ''Pas'' was interpolated especially for the Ballerina [[Lyubov Radina]], who danced the role of Gulnare, and it came to be known as the ''Pas d'Esclave'' - a dramatic ''Pas d'action'' in which the slave trader Lankendem (known as Isaac Lanquedem in the original production) attemps to "show off" his beautiful slave Gulnare, in order to sell her.

===Petipa's revival of 1863===

It is significant to address that by 1863, Jules Perrot had left Russia, and Petipa was serving as the Imperial Ballet's second Balletmaster. The great choreographer [[Arthur Saint-Léon]] held the position of ''Maître de Ballet'' (first Balletmaster) until his death in 1870. Upon the death of Saint-Léon Petipa was named ''Maître de Ballet'', a position he would hold until 1903. 

Petipa presented his own completely new revision of ''Le Corsaire'' on January 24/February 5 ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]/[[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendar dates), [[1863]], which was produced especially for his wife, the ''[[Prima Ballerina]]'' [[Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa]]. For this new production Petipa commissioned the composer [[Cesare Pugni]] (who was at that time the ''First Imperial Ballet Composer'' to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres) to make additions and modify the ballet's score. Among Pugni's additions was the ''Corsaire's Mazurka'' for the second act, which is still retained in modern productions.

'''The Grand Pas de Trois des Odalisques''' -

For his 1863 revival Petipa also expanded the ''Pas des Odalisques'' of Act II. Originally this ''Pas'' consisted of only Adolphe Adam's [[waltz]] from the original score. Petipa decided to revise this ''Pas'' into a standard Classical ''Pas de Trois'' (which consist of an ''Entrée'', 3 variations, and [[coda (music)|coda]]). Petipa retained Adam's original waltz, which became the ''Entrée'', and added the three variations and a coda: the first two variations and the coda were set to new music by Pugni, while the third variation, transferred into the ''Pas'' from another scene, was originally written by Adam as a variation for Gulnare. This ''Pas'' was transformed into what is now known as the ''Grand Pas de Trois des Odalisques'' (AKA the ''Classical Trio of the Odalisques''), and is still danced today.

===Mazilier's revival of 1867 and Petipa's revival of 1868===

Four years later in Paris, [[Joseph Mazilier]] came out of retirement to mount a revival of ''Le Corsaire'' especially for the famous German Ballerina [[Adèle Grantzow]], and in celebration of the [[Universal Exposition]] (World's Fair). 

'''Le Jardin Animé''' -

For this 1867 revival Mazilier rechoreographed the entire ballet, and staged a new ''Grand Ballabile'' to new music by [[Léo Delibes]] especially for Grantzow, known at the time as the ''Grand Pas des Fleurs''. This revival premiered on [[October 21]], [[1867]] at the Paris Opéra to an even bigger success than the original production. This was to be Mazilier's last work for the ballet; he died shortly after the ballet's premiere on [[April 18]], [[1868]]. His revival was given a total of 81 performances with Grantzow as Medora, and after her departure from Paris the work was again taken out of the Paris Opéra's repertory, never to be performed by the Parisian ballet again.

While performing ''Le Corsaire'' in Paris, Adèle Granztow was invited to perform with the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, and for the occasion, Petipa mounted a complete revival of ''Le Corsaire''. Grantzow made certain that she could perform the ''Grand Pas de Fleurs'' in this staging, and so the ballerina assisted Petipa in mounting Mazilier's choreography, though she was rather surprised at how much the Balletmaster revised it. Not only did Petipa do this, but he also changed the scene's title to ''Le Jardin Animé'' (''The Animated Garden''), as it is still known today. The revival premiered on January 25/February 6 ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]/[[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendar dates), [[1868]], and was so successful that performances of other works had to be cancelled due to the public demand.

===Petipa's revivals of 1885, and 1899===

Petipa then presented his third complete revision of ''Le Corsaire'' on November 10/22 ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]/[[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendar dates), [[1885]], created especially for the ballerina [[Eugeniia Sokolova]]. The Balletmaster completely rechoreographed the entire ballet for the occasion, and added new variations to the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'' to the music of [[Léon Minkus]] (''First Imperial Ballet Composer'' to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres from 1871-1886) which were used in substitution for Delibes's original variations. 

[[Image:Corsaire -Le Jardin Anime -Mathilde Kschessinska & Olga Preobrajenska -1899.JPG|thumb|left|175px|<center>Pierina Legnani as Medora and Olga Preobrajenskaya as Gulnare in the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'' from ''Le Corsaire'', St. Petersburg, 1899]]

Petipa then presented his last, and indeed most important revival of ''Le Corsaire'' on January 13/25 ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]/[[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendar dates), [[1899]] at the [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]], rechoreographing the majority of the ballet. This production was mounted especially for the ''Prima Ballerina Assoluta'' [[Pierina Legnani]] who danced Medora, with [[Olga Preobrajenskaya]] as Gulnare, and [[Pavel Gerdt]] as Conrad.

In 19th century ballet it was standard practice for a [[ballerina]] or [[danseur]] to interpolate a variation from another work into a ballet. Often the composers of the [[Imperial Ballet]] would literally "custom score" a variation at the request of a dancer. New variations had found their way into ''Le Corsaire'' throughout the work's performance history, but for Petipa's 1899 revival, new variations for Medora and Gulnare were used in substitution of Delibes' original solos in the scene ''Le Jardin Animé''. The first, danced by Olga Preobrajenskaya as Gulnare, was originally the ''Variation of Amour'' taken from the 1876 Petipa/Minkus ballet ''[[The Adventures of Peleus]]'', while the second variation, danced by Pierina Legnani as Medora, was taken from Petipa's 1883 ballet ''[[Pygmalion or The Cyprus Statue|Pygmalion]]'' (AKA ''The Cyprus Statue'') to the music of [[Prince Nikita Trubetskoi]]. 

The variation danced in 1899 by Olga Preobrajenskaya as Gulnare is no longer performed in ''Le Jardin Animé'' anywhere in the world, and has been replaced over time by a variation that is by an unknown hand, though it is believed to be by Cesare Pugni, and is still danced by Gulnare in almost all productions of ''Le Corsaire'' in the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'' (this unidentified variation is danced by the Ballerina [[Paloma Herrera]] in the popular 1999 film of [[American Ballet Theatre]]'s production of ''Le Corsaire''). The variation danced in 1899 by Pierina Legnani as Medora is still retained in the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'' in the [[Kirov Ballet|Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's]] production of ''Le Corsaire'' (this variation is danced by the Ballerina [[Altynai Asylmoratova]] in the popualar 1989 film of the [[Kirov Ballet|Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's]] production of ''Le Corsaire''). In later times the variation for Medora in the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'' has been occasionally replaced as well. During ''Le Jardin Animé'', the Mariinsky ''Prima Ballerina'' [[Natalia Dudinskaya]] preferred to dance the rarely heard ''Variation of the Flower Girl'' taken from Léon Minkus'  score for Petipa's ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' (this variation is danced by Medora during ''Le Jardin Animé'' in most western productions of ''Le Corsaire'', notably by [[Julie Kent]] in the popular 1999 film of [[American Ballet Theatre]]'s production of ''Le Corsaire'').

===The Le Corsaire Pas de Deux===

For his revival of ''Le Corsaire'' in 1899, Marius Petipa commissioned the composer/conductor [[Riccardo Drigo]] to score a ''Grand Pas de Deux'' especially for Pierina Legnani's performance. Drigo came through with one of the most famous pieces of music in all of ballet: a short ''Entrée'' for [[harp]], an ''Adagio'', a fiery variation for the Suitor in triple time, a variation in polka time for Medora, and a rousing coda, complete with the required 32 bars of music for Legnani's famous [[32 fouettés en tournant]]. The Danseur [[Aleksander Chekrygin]] danced the suitor.

[[Image:Corsaire -Alla Sizova & Rudolf Nureyev -1955.jpg|thumb|right|260px|<center>Alla Sizova and Rudolf Nureyev in the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', Leningrad, 1958]]

It is not known for certain who was responsible for the choreography of Chekrygin's dancing in his variation andin the coda. There were occasions where Petipa either allowed the male dancers to choreograph their own solos, or the Balletmaster would send the Dansuer to [[Christian Johansson]], the influential teacher of the male dancers Imperial Ballet, to arrange the variation.

Legnani's original variation in polka rhythm, which over the years has been substituted out quite often, is perhaps one of the most difficult solos for the classical ballerina that Petipa ever choreographed. Legnani, an Italian virtuosa, was well-known for her extraordinary technique, and for her variation in the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' Petipa lavished notoriously intricate combinations that still challenge ballerinas to this day.

Today, the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' is performed as a ''Pas de Trois'' in nearly every production of the full-length work, with the character of Conrad participating in the central Adagio. It is a common misconception that the ''Pas de Deux'' was originally danced as a ''Pas de Trois'' in 1899. To add to this misconception, [[Kevin McKenzie]], director of [[American Ballet Theatre]], stated in a documentary about the company's new production of ''Le Corsaire'', that the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' was originally danced as a ''Pas de Trois''. In actuality this revision did not come about until well into the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period - though ballet historians are not certain which production first presented the piece as a ''Pas de Trois'', it was possibly the revisions of [[Fedor Lophukov]] during the 1920s that first saw the piece danced in this way.  According to the program of Petipa's 1899 revival and contemporary accounts, Legnani and Chekrygin performed the original staging of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' as a duet.

In 1931, Agrippina Vaganova revised the choreography of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' especially for the graduation performance of her star pupil [[Natalia Dudinskaya]], who was partnered by [[Konstantin Sergeyev]]. Through Vaganova's revision, the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' took on the basic shape it has today. In 1939 Vaganova's revision of the ''Pas de Deux'' was interpolated into her own 1931 staging of the full-length ''Le Corsaire'', danced by [[Galina Ulanova]] and [[Nikolai Zubkovsky]].

It was the noted ''Premiere Danseur'' of the Kirov/Mariinksy Ballet [[Vakhtang Chabukiani]] who had the most influential hand in refashioning the male dancing of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux''.  During his performances in the ''Pas'' during the 1930s and 1940s he gave the male role more athletic and virtuoso choreographic elements. His interpretaion of the male role became in essence the standard, and it has remained so to the present day.

[[Image:Le Corsaire -Vakhtang Chabukiani -1941.jpg|thumb|right|200px|<center>Vakhtang Chabukiani as the slave Ali in the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's production of ''Le Corsaire'', 1941. Chabukiani was the first to wear a shirt-less costume consisting of baggy pants for the character, which is today the standard]]

In 1960, [[Rudolf Nureyev]] staged the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' for himself and [[Margot Fonteyn]] in London. All that was available of Drigo's music in the west at the time was a piano reduction, and so Nureyev called upon [[John Lanchbery]] to create the orchestrations. Today, Lanchbery's arrangements are still in use by many ballet compaies in the west.

===The Slave Ali===

Alexander Chekrygin, the male dancer who was the first to dance in Petipa's original 1899 staging of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', was simply a suitor for the Ballerina and had no other function in the rest of the ballet. By the 1930s when the Danseur Nikolai Zubkovsky danced the role, this suitor evolved into a character known as the ''Rhab'' (Russian for ''Slave''), and was identified as Conrad's slave who swears loyalty to Medora as her servant. Through the revivals of Vaganova and Gusev at the Kirov/Mariinsky the character was named Ali, and was given a more prevalent part in the ballet. By the time Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's ''Premiere Danseur'' Vakhtang Chabukiani danced the role in the late 1930s/early 1940s the character wore a costume which consisted of baggy pants, chains around a shirt-less torso, and a head-band with a feather protruding from the forehead. This change in the character from a mere suitor to an exotic slave also gave rise to revisions in the choreography of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', with many of the dancers who performed in the role adding in more passionate and exotic elements of choreography, suggesting the slave's devotion to his master's beloved.

===Alternate Variations for the Ballerina===

Drigo's original ballerina's variation from the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' - a quick variation in polka time - has been substituted out many times throughout the work's performance's history - in 1958 [[Rudolf Nureyev]] danced the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' with [[Alla Sizova]] for their graduation performance from the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Vaganova Choreographic Institutution]] (school of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet). For the occasion Sizova substituted the original Ballerina's variation for the ''Variation of the Dryad Queen'' from Alexander Gorsky's 1900 revival of Petipa's ballet ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' (which Gorsky added to the ballet to new music by [[Anton Simon]]. Today this music is almost always incorrectly credited to Léon Minkus).

When Rudolf Nureyev staged the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' for the first time in the West, he also included the variation that Sizova danced for their graduation performance, likely because it suited the more lyrical gifts of Fonteyn. For many years Nureyev's staging of the ''Pas'' became the standard in the west, complete with Fonteyn's interpolated variation. The other variation often danced in substitution of the original Ballerina solo is the ''Variation of Gamzatti'' from the ''Grand Pas d'Action'' from the Petipa/Minkus ''[[La Bayadère]]'' (this variation is actually from the ''Pas de Venus'' from Petipa's 1868 ballet ''[[Tsar Kandavl]]'' to the music of [[Cesare Pugni]], and was added to ''La Bayadère'' by the Ballerina [[Olga Preobrajenskaya]] in 1900 when she danced Gamzatti).

== The notation of Petipa's 'Le Corsaire' ==

Petipa's choreography for ''Le Corsaire'' was documented in the [[Stepanov method of dance notation]] in circa 1894 and completed in 1900. In the early 1890s, the Imperial Ballet began documenting their repertory in the [[Stepanov method of dance notation]], the majority of which being the choreography of Petipa. Around the time of the [[Russian revolution]] of 1917, the Imperial Ballet's régisseur [[Nicholas Sergeyev]] smuggled this cache of notation out of Russia, and used it to stage such works as ''[[The Sleeping Beauty Ballet|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', and Petipa's definitive ''[[Giselle]]'' and ''[[Coppelia]]'' for the first time in the west for such companies as the [[Ballet Russe]] and the [[Royal Ballet]] (then the [[Vic-Wells Ballet]]). From there these ballets went on to be staged all over the world. In 1969 [[Harvard University]] purchased this collection and named it the [[Sergeyev Collection]], where it now resides as part of the university's theatre collection.

== 'Le Corsaire' in the 20th century and America ==

''Le Corsaire'' had been staged at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow as early as 1858 in a version later revised by the Balletmaster [[Ivan Clustin]] in 1902. It was not until after Petipa's death that a new revival was mounted at the Bolshoi Theatre by [[Alexander Gorsky]], premiering on January 15/28 ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]/[[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendar dates), [[1912]] with [[Ekaterina Geltzer]] as Medora and [[Vasily Tikhomirov]] as Conrad. This staging, long gone from the repertory of the Bolshoi Theatre, was a restaging of Petipa's 1899 revival with revisions by Gorsky. He also included new dances to the music of such composers as [[Vasily Soloviev-Sedoy]], [[Reinhold Glière]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], and even [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]].

Petipa's last revival of ''Le Corsaire'' remained in the repertory of the [[Imperial Ballet]] until 1928 (by that time the company was known as the ''State Petrograd Ballet''), where up to that point it had been performed an incredible 224 times since the premiere of the 1899 production. Many more stagings of ''Le Corsaire'' followed in versions that, for the most part, retained all of the ballet's classical dances as set down by Petipa, which by that time were considered almost sacrosanct (though they were not entirely immune from revision themselves).

The changes that came along in these revivals were done rather severely to the incidental scenes of action. As a result, the ballet's plot evolved from a melo-drama into what many consider to be an absurd and insignificant comic tale that merely serves as the glue holding the dancing passages together.

[[Image:Corsaire -Kirov -Zhakarova & Korsakov.JPG|thumb|left|270px|<center>Svetlana Zakharova as Medora and Anton Korsakov as Lankendem in the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's 1989 production of Pyotr Gusev's version of ''Le Corsaire'', St. Petersburg, 2001]]

[[Agrippina Vaganova]], the revered pedagogue of Russian Ballet, supervised the first "after Petipa" revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the Kirov Ballet in 1931. The next important revival of the work was staged by the Balletmaster [[Pyotr Gusev]] in 1955 for the [[Maly Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Ballet of the Maly Theatre]] of St. Petersburg. This was the first production of the work to present a completely modified version of the libretto, written by Gusev and the ballet historian [[Yuri Slonimsky]], which included a new character - the slave Ali - who would also perform the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' as the suitor. Aside from the new libretto Gusev opted to do a complete revision of the ballet's score - although by this time the score for ''Le Corsaire'' contained the traditional interpolated dances by many composers ( the ''Pas d'Esclave'', the ''Corsaire's Mazurka'', the ''Grand Pas de Trois des Odalisques'', the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'', the ''Grand Pas de Deux à Trois''/''Grand Pas de Deux'', as well as the usual supplemental variations), the majority of the score still belonged to Adolphe Adam, as the music for the incidental scenes of action were from his original score of 1856. Gusev opted to discard nearly all of this original music in favor of music fashioned out of themes from Adam's 1842 ballet ''[[La Jolie Fille du Gand]]'', as well as more additions from various ballets by Cesare Pugni.

With this interpolated music new [[leitmotif]]s were fashioned for the ballet's main characters, along with Gusev creating a new version of the ballet's prologue - this scene included the standard opening of the ballet with the famous shipwreck, followed by a scene set on a beach. Gusev added here a new Entrance for Medora, and an elaborate ''Pas'' for Gulnare, Medora, and ten other ballerinas, who subsequently find Conrad and his party washed ashore. Soon after the women are kidnapped by Lankendem and his cohorts, which causes Conrad and his party to go to their rescue. Gusev also added many individual dances throughout his production from Riccardo Drigo's score for Petipa's 1889 ballet ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|The Talisman]]''. Originally Gusev had intended to mount this revision for the [[Kirov Ballet]], but the company chose to retain Vaganova's 1931 staging (Gusev's production was also staged for the [[Novosibirsk Ballet]] in 1964, where it is still retained).

Many more revisions of ''Le Corsaire'' were mounted in Russia, perhaps one of the most noted being in 1958 for the [[Stanislavsky Ballet]] by the former ballerina [[Nina Grishschina]] with the assistance of the Balletmasters [[Alexei Chichinadze]] and [[Vladimir Bourmiester]], a production which was revived in 1989. In 1973, the Balletmaster of the Kirov Ballet [[Konstantin Sergeyev]] staged his own completely new revision of ''Le Corsaire'', a production which was soon pulled 4 years later by [[Oleg Vinogradov]], the former director of the [[Maly Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Ballet of the Maly Theatre]], who was appointed director of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet that year. Vinogradov opted to stage Gusev's 1955 revision of the ballet instead, a production that the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet still retains in its repertory to the present day.

In 1989 the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet decided to present a revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for its upcoming world tour. There was much debate as to whether Gusev's staging would be retained or whether Sergeyev's version would be reinstated. In the end, they chose to retain Gusev's version, while still lavishing the production with new sets and costumes. This staging premiered to great success in New York at the [[Metropolitan Opera House]] on July 3, 1989 with the Ballerina [[Altynai Asylmuratova]] as Medora (this production was filmed at the Mariinsky Theatre in April of 1989, and has been released onto DVD/video).

Sergeyev then staged a complete revival of his 1973 revision of ''Le Corsaire'' for the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], at the invitation of [[Yuri Grigorovich]], the company's director. For this version, Sergeyev called upon the Bolshoi Ballet's fasmous head conductor [[Alexander Sotnikov]] to reorchestrate and revise much of the music. This production premiered on March 11, 1992 to great success, becoming Sergeyev's last work for the ballet; he died on April 1, that same year. Grigorovich then decided to pull Sergeyev's staging from the Bolshoi's repertory after only seven performances, so that there would be no competition for his own staging, which premiered on February 16, 1994, a production that is still retained in the repertory of the Bolshoi Ballet.

The sets and costumes designed by [[Irina Tibilova]] which were used for Konstantin Sergeyev's production of ''Le Corsaire'' sat unused in the archives of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] for almost five years. At the suggestion of Sergeyev's wife, the celebrated Ballerina and teacher [[Natalia Dudinskaya]], [[Anna-Marie Holmes]] staged Sergeyev's production for the [[Boston Ballet]] (with the assistance of Dudinskaya, [[Tatiana Terekhova]], [[Sergei Berezhnoi]], [[Tatiana Legat]], and [[Vadim Disnitsky]]).

The music for this production was copied from the conductor's score used by Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet, as well as additional parts taken from the Mariinsky Theatre library. In some cases however, the Boston Ballet used copies of the Bolshoi's score, which contained orchestrations by Alexander Sotnikov. The Boston Ballet music librarian Arthur Leeth, the company pianist Marina Gendal, and conductor Jonathan McPhee performed a cut-and-paste operation on the score as the choreography was adapted for the new staging. This required the re-ordering of many numbers, as well as a few new transitional passages which were composed by Kevin Galie. Galie also did soem minor reorchestrating throughout many parts of the score. This production premiered on March 27, 1997 with the Ballerina [[Natasha Akhmarova]] as Medora, to great success.

Nearly one year later, [[American Ballet Theatre]] in New York rented the Boston Ballet's production for its own staging of ''Le Corsaire''. The staging went through even more revisions both choreographically and musically, with musical modifications performed by American Ballet Theatre conductor Charles Parker and the company pianist Henrietta Stern. This production premiered on June 19, 1998, with [[Nina Ananiashvili]] as Medora, [[Ashley Tuttle]] as Gulnare, [[Giuseppe Picone]] as Conrad, [[Jose Manuel Carreño]] as Ali, and [[Vladimir Malakhov]] Lankendem. The [[American Ballet Theatre|ABT]] production was later filmed at the [[Orange County Performing Arts Center]] in [[Costa Mesa]], [[California]] by [[PBS]] for [[Great Performances]] in 1999, with [[Julie Kent]] as Medora, [[Paloma Herrera]] as Gulnare, [[Ethan Steifel]] as Conrad, [[Angel Corella]] as Ali, and [[Vladimir Malakhov]] as Lankendem.

Today the full-length ''Le Corsaire'' has been staged by many companies all over the world. It is Pyotr Gusev and Konstantin Sergeyev's stagings that serve as the foundation for these productions, though to date there has not been a company who has chose to merge the two. Outside of Russia, primarily in western Europe and the [[Americas]], it is Sergeyev's production that has been staged primarily, while in Russia and in eastern Europe Gusev's revision has been staged for the most part.

== Pacific Northwest Ballet School's reconstruction of ''Le Jardin Animé'' ==

In June 2004 the School of the [[Pacific Northwest Ballet]] in [[Seattle]] presented a reconstruction of Petipa's choreography for the scene ''Le Jardin Animè'', taken directly from the notation of the [[Sergeyev Collection]]. It was staged by the dance historian and Stepanov notation expert [[Douglas Fullington]], and [[Manard Stewart]], former principle dancer of the Pacific Northwest Ballet.

Medora, Conrad, and the slave Ali dance a ''Grand Pas Classique''  (the ''Grand Pas de Deux à Trois'' or ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux''). Afterward, Medora entreats Conrad, in the name of their love, to free all the slave girls. He agrees, but Birbanto rebels against the idea and instead persuades the pirates to riot against Conrad. By the force of Conrad's commanding personality and physical presence, he single-handedly instills terror into the hearts of the corsairs and they abandon their mutinous plan. Not to be thwarted, Birbanto devises a new scheme. He sprays a rose with a sleeping potion and forces Lankendem to help him pass the flower to Medora, who unwittingly gives it to Conrad. He inhales its aroma and falls into a drugged sleep. The corsairs return to the grotto and attempt to capture Medora. While struggling, she snatches a dagger and cuts Birbanto's arm. In the confusion, Lankendem steals Medora back and escapes. Birbanto is about to kill Conrad but is interrupted by the slave. Stunned and broken-hearted, Conrad discovers Medora missing. Birbanto feigns ignorance and swears his loyalty to Conrad.

After the residents flee, Medora names Birbanto as the traitor and Conrad kills him. Conrad, Ali, Medora and Gulnare all escape to the Corsaire ship.

'''''Scene 4: The Storm''''' The corsair ship sails upon a calm sea. Conrad, at the helm, cradles Medora in his arms. Suddenly a fierce storm blows across as lightning illuminates the darkening sky. Gusting winds shred the sails and a lightning bolt snaps the ship's mast in half. The ship sinks amidst the relentless, turbulent waters.

===Epilogue===
As the wind subsides and the sea calms itself, the moon rises in the sky. It sheds light upon Conrad and Medora, clinging to a rock and offering thanks for their miraculous survival, a testimony to the strength of their love.

== The music of ''Le Corsaire'' on CD ==
The following list is of recordings of music from the ballet ''Le Corsaire''. Though there are bootleg recordings available taken from the soundtrack of the American Ballet Theatre and the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's DVD releases, this list concentrates only on officially released recordings.

[[Image:Corsaire.JPG|thumb|right|200px|<center>Recording of Adolphe Adam's original score for ''Le Corsaire'' by Richard Bonynge and the English Chamber Orchestra]]

*'''Adam: Le Corsaire''' Richard Bonynge, [[English Chamber Orchestra]]. (1992) Decca 430 286-2, 2CDs. Out-of-print. '''Note''' for this recording Bonynge utilized the conductor's score as used for Mazilier's 1867 revival of ''Le Corsaire''. It contains Adam's original, unaltered score, as well as Delibes' addition of the music for the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'' in it's original orchestration by Delibes, and with the original variations for the characters Medora and Gulnare. It does not contain the additions added to the score in Russia throughout the mid to late 19th century.

*'''Musiques Pour les Ballets de Marius Petipa''' Klaus Weise, Orchestre Philharmonique de Nice. (1996) Accord 205472, 1 CD. Out-of-print.

These pieces are incorrectly attributed solely to Adam in the liner notes. The music in this recording is presented in the Bolshoi Ballet's version, in an orchestration by Alexander Sotnikov. To date, this is the only officially released professional recording of these pieces.

*'''Ballet Gala''' from the Boxed-set '''Original Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra''' Georgi G. Zhemchushin, Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. (1989) Pilz 44 1008-2, 1 CD. Out-of-print.
