The '''American Library Association''' (ALA) is a group based in the [[United States]] that promotes [[library|libraries]] and library education internationally. It is the oldest and largest library association in the world, with approximately 64,600 members. Founded in [[1876]] in [[Philadelphia]] and chartered in [[1879]] in [[Massachusetts]], its head office is now in [[Chicago]]. Since 2002, [[Keith Michael Fiels]] has been the ALA executive director (CEO).<ref>{{cite press release | date = 2002-04-22 | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/pressreleasesbucket/keithmichael.htm | title =Keith Michael Fiels named ALA's new Executive Director | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref>

The stated mission of the ALA is "to provide leadership for the development, promotion, and improvement of library and information services and the profession of librarianship in order to enhance learning and ensure access to information for all."  ALA membership is open to any person or organization, though most of its members are [[library|libraries]] or librarians. As well, most members live and work in the United States, with international members comprising 3.5% of total membership.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/ourassociation/governingdocs/aheadto2010/international.htm | title =ALA International Member Survey | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref>

The ALA is governed by an elected council and an executive board. Policies and programs are administered by various committees and round tables. One of the organization's most visible tasks is overseen by the Office for Accreditation, which formally reviews and authorizes American and Canadian academic institutions that offer degree programs in [[Library science|library and information science]]. 

Members may join one or more of eleven membership divisions that deal with specialized topics such as academic, school, or public libraries, technical or reference services, and library administration.  Members may also join any of seventeen round tables that are grouped around more specific interests and issues than the broader set of ALA divisions. 

The ALA is affiliated with regional, state, and student chapters across the country. It also organizes conferences, participates in library standards development, and publishes a number of books and periodicals. The ALA annually confers numerous notable book and media awards, including the [[Caldecott Medal]], the [[Newbery Medal]], the [[Michael L. Printz Award]] and the [[Stonewall Book Award]].<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/bookmediaawards | title =Book/Media Awards | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref>

The ALA publishes the magazines ''[[American Libraries]]'' and ''[[Booklist]]''.

== Political stances ==
The ALA advocates positions on [[United States]] political issues that it believes are related to libraries and librarianship.  For court cases that touch on issues about which the organization  holds positions, the ALA often files [[amicus curiae|amici curiae]] briefs.  The ALA has an office in [[Washington, D.C.]], that [[Lobbying|lobbies]] [[United States Congress|Congress]] on issues relating to libraries, information and communication.  It also provides materials to libraries that may include information on how to apply for grants, how to comply with the law, and how to oppose a law.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/washoff/WOissues/issues.htm | title =Washington Office Issues | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}<!-- this link is dead, 2007-04-06 --></ref>

=== Civil liberties, intellectual freedom, and privacy ===
The ALA maintains an Office for Intellectual Freedom, under the guidance of director [[Judith Krug]].  The Office promotes [[intellectual freedom]], which the ALA defines as "the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction. It provides for free access to all expressions of ideas through which any and all sides of a question, cause or movement may be explored."<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/basics/intellectual.htm | title =Intellectual Freedom and Censorship Q &amp; A | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref>  The primary documented expressions of the ALA's intellectual freedom principles are the Freedom to Read Statement<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/statementspols/ftrstatement/freedomreadstatement.htm| title=Freedom to Read Statement}}</ref> and the [[Library Bill of Rights]].

As a result of its stance on intellectual freedom, the ALA is generally opposed to any [[censorship]] of the material in libraries.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/statementspols/statementsif/librarybillrights.htm | title =Library Bill of Rights | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> Interviewed about an attempt to remove a book from a suburban Boston middle school, Deborah Caldwell-Stone, deputy director of the ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom, said, "Our hope is that books are retained rather than removed. Ultimately, every challenge is an attempt to remove ideas from the discourse."<ref>{{cite web | last =Kocian | first =Lisa | date = 2006-11-12 | url =http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/11/12/6th_grade_book_stirs_rethinking/ | title =6th-grade book stirs rethinking | work =The Boston Globe | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref>

In 1970, the ALA founded the first [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] professional organization, called the "Task Force on Gay Liberation".<ref name=glbtrt>{{cite web |title=ALA: Welcome to the GLBT Round Table |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/glbtrt/welcomeglbtround.htm |accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref><ref name=gittings>{{cite book |last=Gittings |first=Barbara |title=Gays in Library Land: The Gay and Lesbian Task Force of the American Library Association: The First Sixteen Years |location=Philadelphia |year=1990}}</ref>

In 1999, radio personality [[Laura Schlessinger]] campaigned publicly against the ALA's intellectual freedom policy, specifically in regard to the ALA's refusal to remove a link on its web site to an explicit sex-education site for teens.<ref>{{cite web | date = 1999-05-10 | url =http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA158676.html | title ="Dr. Laura" Continues Criticism of ALA | work =Library Journal | publisher =ALA  | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> Critics said, however, that Schlessinger "distorted and misrepresented the ALA stand to make it sound like the ALA was saying porno for 'children' is O.K."<ref>{{cite magazine | last =Presley | first =Sharon | year =2001 | month = Winter | url =http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&page=presley_21_1 | title =Don't Listen to Dr. Laura | journal =Free Inquiry | publisher = | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | accessdate =2007-03-08}}</ref>  

In upholding its commitment to intellectual freedom, the ALA filed suit with library users and the ACLU against the United States [[Children's Internet Protection Act]], which required libraries receiving federal E-rate discounts for Internet access to install a "technology protection measure" to prevent children from accessing "visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors." <ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ifea.net/cipa.pdf | title =Text of the Children's Internet Protection Act}}</ref> At trial, the federal district court struck down the law as unconstitutional. <ref><I>United States v. Am. Lib. Asso.</I>, 201 F.Supp.2d 401, 490 (2002)</ref> The government appealed this decision, and on June 23, 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld the law as constitutional as a condition imposed on institutions in exchange for government funding. In upholding the law, the Supreme Court, adopting the interpretation urged by the U.S. Solicitor General at oral argument, made it clear that the constitutionality of CIPA would be upheld only "if, as the Government represents, a librarian will unblock filtered material or disable the Internet software filter without significant delay on an adult user's request."<ref>{{cite web | year = | url =http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=539&invol=194 | title =''US v ALA'' 539 U.S. 194, 2003 | format = | work = | publisher =FindLaw | accessdate =2007-03-21}}</ref> 

In 2003, the ALA passed a resolution opposing the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which called sections of the law "a present danger to the constitutional rights and privacy rights of library users".<ref>{{cite web | date =2003-01-29 | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/statementspols/ifresolutions/resolutionusa.htm | title =Resolution on the USA PATRIOT Act and Related Measures that Infringe on the Rights of Library Users | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> Since then, the ALA and its members have sought to change the law by working with members of Congress and educating their communities and the press about the law's potential to violate the privacy rights of library users.  ALA has also participated as an ''amicus curiae'' in lawsuits filed by individuals challenging the constitutionality of the USA PATRIOT Act, including a lawsuit filed by four Connecticut librarians after the library consortium they managed was served with a National Security Letter seeking information about library users. <ref>{{cite news | last = Cowan | first = Alison Leigh | date = 2006-05-31 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/nyregion/31library.html?ex=1306728000&en=9f197630a8f4a0a9&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | title = Four Librarians Finally Break Silence in Records Case | work = The New York Times | accessdate =2007-02-07}}</ref> After several months of litigation, the lawsuit was dismissed when the FBI decided to withdraw the National Security Letter.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2006-06-26 | url =http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/FBI_drops_demand_for_information_from_0626.html | title = FBI drops demand for information from Connecticut library group | work =Raw Story | accessdate =2007-02-07}}</ref>

The ALA sells humorous "radical militant librarian" buttons for librarians to wear in support of the ALA's stances on intellectual freedom, privacy, and civil liberties.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.ala.org/ala/oif/basics/basicrelatedlinks/radicalbutton.htm | title = "Radical, Militant Librarian" Button | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> Inspiration for the button’s design came from documents obtained from the FBI by the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC) through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request. The request revealed a series of e-mails in which FBI agents complained about the "radical, militant librarians" while criticizing the reluctance of FBI management to use the secret warrants authorized under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.<ref>{{cite press release | date=2006-01-17| url =http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=pressreleases&template=/contentmanagement/contentdisplay.cfm&ContentID=113573| title = ALA introduces "Radical, Militant Librarian" button | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2007-03-07}}</ref>

=== Copyright ===
The ALA says it "supports efforts to amend the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) and to urge the courts to restore the balance in copyright law, ensure fair use and protect and extend the public domain".<ref>{{cite web | last =Nisbet | first =Miriam | year = 2006 | month = October | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/washoff/WOissues/copyrightb/copyagenda.pdf | title =2006 Copyright Agenda | format = PDF | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> It supports changing [[copyright]] law to release [[orphan works]] into the [[public domain]]; is wary of [[digital rights management]]; and, in [[ALA v. FCC]], successfully sued the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to prevent regulation that would enforce next-generation digital televisions to contain rights-management hardware.  It has joined the [http://www.informationaccess.org/ Information Access Alliance] to promote open access to research.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/washoff/WOissues/copyrightb/copyright.htm | title =Copyright Issues | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref>

== Conferences ==
The ALA and its divisions hold numerous conferences throughout the year, of which the two ALA-wide ones are the ALA Annual Conference and the ALA Midwinter Meeting. Midwinter is typically more focused on internal organization business, while ALA Annual is focused around exhibits and presentations. The Annual conference is generally held in June, and Midwinter is typically held in January. ALA Annual is notable for being one of the largest professional conferences in existence, typically drawing over 25,000 attendees.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=confservices | title =Conference Services | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> The 2006 Annual Conference was held in [[New Orleans]]; the association considered moving the conference to a new location after [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck, but conference organizers chose to continue plans for holding the conference in New Orleans to show support for the city.
