The '''Tupolev TB-3''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Тяжелый Бомбардировщик, Tyazholy Bombardirovschik, Heavy Bomber, civilian designation '''ANT-6''') was a heavy bomber aircraft which was deployed by the [[Soviet Air Force]] in the 1930s and during [[World War II]]. It was the world's first [[cantilever#In aircraft|cantilever wing]] four-engine heavy bomber.<ref name="shavrov">{{cite book|author=Shavrov V.B.|year=1985|title=Istoriia konstruktskii samoletov v SSSR do 1938 g. (3 izd.)|language=Russian|publisher=Mashinostroenie|id=ISBN 5-217-03112-3}}</ref> Despite obsolescence and being officially withdrawn from service in 1939, TB-3 performed bomber and transport duties through much of WWII. The TB-3 also saw combat as a [[Zveno project]] fighter mothership and as a light tank transport.

==Design and development==

In 1925, [[Soviet Air Force]] approached [[TsAGI]] with a requisition for a heavy bomber with total engine output of 2,000 [[horsepower|PS]] (1,970 [[horsepower|hp]]) and either wheeled or float landing gear. [[Tupolev]] [[OKB]] started design work in 1926 with the government operational requirements finalized in 1929.<ref name="shavrov"/> [[Tupolev TB-1]] was taken as the basis for the design and the aircraft was initially powered by [[Curtiss V-1570]] "Conqueror" engines generating 600 PS (590 hp) each, with the intent of switching to [[Mikulin M-17]]s (modified [[BMW VI]]s) in production.<ref name="shavrov"/> The [[mock-up]] was approved on [[21 March]] [[1930]] and the first prototype was completed on [[31 October]] [[1930]]. The aircraft flew on [[22 December]] [[1930]] with [[Mikhail Gromov (aviator)|Mikhail Gromov]] at the controls and with [[ski]] landing gear.<ref name="shavrov"/> On [[20 February]] [[1931]], Soviet Air Force approved mass production of ANT-6 with M-17 engines.

[[Image:TB-3-first.jpg|thumb|right|The first ANT-6 prototype]]
The prototype was refitted with BMW VIz 500 engines of 730 PS (720 hp) each, larger radiators, and wooden fixed-pitch propellers of TsAGI design. Single-wheel landing gear was deemed too weak and was replaced by [[tandem]] [[bogie]]s with 1350×300 mm (53×12 [[inch|in]]) tires.<ref name="shavrov"/> The first pre-production '''TB-3-4M-17''' flew on [[4 January]] [[1932]] with A. B. Yumashev and I. F. Petrov at the controls. Unexpectedly, subsequent mass-produced aircraft were found to be 10-12% heavier than the prototype which significantly hampered performance.<ref name="shavrov"/> The discrepancy was discovered to be due to high positive tolerances on raw materials which resulted in [[steel]] sheetmetal, pipes, and wires being much thicker than on the carefully constructed prototypes. The aircraft were also more crudely painted with a thick layer of camouflage and lacquer.<ref name="shavrov"/> The factories asked the workers for suggestions on reducing the weight, paying 100 [[roubles]] for each [[kilogram]] (2.2 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) removed from the aircraft. In combination with OKB efforts, this resulted in weight savings of almost 800 kg (1,765 lb). Despite this, production aircraft could differ from each other by as much as several hundred kilograms.<ref name="shavrov"/> 

In 1933, a single TB-3-4M-17F was [[streamline]]d with removal of [[turret]]s and [[bomb]] [[shackle]]s, covering of all openings, and fitting of wheel spats. This resulted in only a 4.5% increase in top speed and a similar increase in the range. Tupolev concluded that streamlining was minimally beneficial for large and [[Slow flight|slow aircraft]]. To study the effect of corrugated skin, in January-February 1935 a single TB-3-4AM-34R had the corrugations incrementally covered with fabric. This resulted in a 5.5% gain in top speed and a 27.5% increase in the ceiling. The same aircraft demonstrated a significant increase in [[Rate of climb|climb rate]] when fitted with experimental four-[[Single-blade propeller|blade propeller]]s.<ref name="shavrov"/>

;Record flights<ref name="shavrov"/>
* TB-3-4M-34R set a flight endurance record of 18 hours and 30 minutes.
* TB-3-4AM-34FRN with A. B. Yumashev at the controls set a number of payload-to-altitude records:
** [[11 September]] [[1936 in aviation|1936]] - 5000 kg (11,023 lb) to 8116 m (26,627 [[foot (length)|ft]]), improved to 8980 m (29,462 ft) on [[28 October]].
** [[16 September]] [[1936 in aviation|1936]] - 10000 kg (22,046 lb) to 6605 m (21,670 ft)
** [[20 September]] [[1936 in aviation|1936]] - 12000 kg (26,455 lb) to 2700 m (8,858 ft)

==Description of construction==
[[Image:TB-3 cockpit.jpg|thumb|right|TB-3 cockpit and nose turret, corrugated skin is clearly visible.]]
TB-3 was an all-metal aircraft of steel construction. The frame was composed of V-section [[Beam (nautical)|beam]]s covered with non-stressed corrugated skin ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 mm (1/64 to 1/32 in) in thickness. The corrugations were 13 mm deep (0.5 in) and 50 mm (2 in) apart. The [[cantilever wing]] was supported by four tube-section [[spar]]s. In 1934, thanks to development of [[High speed steel|stronger steel alloy]]s, [[wingspan]] was increased from 39.5 to 41.85 meters (127 ft 7 in to 137 ft 4 in) with a concurrent [[Wing root|wing area]] increase from 230 to 234.5 m² (2,475 to 2,524 ft²). Any part of the aircraft could be walked on in soft shoes without damaging the skin, and the leading edges of the wings swung down to form walkways for engine maintenance. Controls were cable-actuated with a variable-incidence [[tailplane]] and a trim compensation system in case of engine failures on one side. Fixed main [[landing gear]] was not fitted with [[brakes]]. The [[fuel tank]]s did not have fire or leak protection. The M-17 engines were tuned to provide a maximum theoretical range of 3250 km (1,760 [[nautical mile|NM]], 2,020 [[statute mile|mi]]) without spark plug or [[carburetor]] [[fouling]]. Defensive armament consisted of [[light machine gun]]s in five [[turret]]s — one in the nose, two on top of mid-[[fuselage]], and one retractable "dustbin" under each wing between the engine [[nacelle]]s. Later variants moved one of the top fuselage turrets [[aft]] of the tail fin.<ref name="shavrov"/>

==Operational history==
[[Image:TB-3 paratroops.jpg|thumb|right|Paratroopers boarding TB-3 transport.]]
[[Image:T-27 tb-3.jpg|thumb|right|TB-3 carrying a [[T-27]] [[tankette]]]]
The TB-3 was used operationally during the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] and in the [[Winter War]] with [[Finland]]. Although it was officially withdrawn from service in 1939, at the start of the [[Great Patriotic War]] on [[22 June]] [[1941]], Soviet Air Force had 516 operational aircraft, with an additional 25 operated by the Soviet Navy.<ref name="tupolev">{{cite web|url=http://www.tupolev.ru/Russian/Show.asp?SectionID=195|language=Russian|accessdate=2007-04-16 |title=TB-3 (ANT-6)|work=OAO "Tupolev"}}</ref> The aircraft avoided destruction on the ground in the opening phases of the war and TB-3s from 3rd TBAP (Heavy Bombing Regiment) began flying night bombing missions on [[23 June]]. Shortage of combat-ready aircraft also required daytime use of TB-3s without fighter escort and in this role the bombers, operating at low-to-medium altitudes, suffered heavy losses to enemy fighters and ground fire. By August 1941, TB-3s made up 25% of the Soviet bomber force and, operated by elite air force crews, were flying up to three combat missions per night.<ref name="tupolev"/> The aircraft participated in all major battles through 1943, including the [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|first Battle of Smolensk]], the [[Battle of Moscow]], the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and the [[Battle of Kursk]]. On [[1 July]] [[1945]], 18th Air Army still had 10 TB-3s on the active roster.<ref name="tupolev"/>

The TB-3 served extensively as a cargo and paratroop transport, carrying up to 35 soldiers in the latter role.<ref name="shavrov"/> In the first five months of the war, the aircraft transported 2,797 tons of cargo and 2,300 personnel.<ref name="tupolev"/>

The TB-3 was also used in several special projects as a fighter mothership in the [[Zveno project]] and for delivering light [[T-27]], [[T-37 tank|T-37]]. and [[T-38 tank|T-38]] tanks. On [[1 August]] [[1941]], a pair of TB-3s in ''Zveno-SPB'' configuration, each with two [[Polikarpov I-16]] fighters carrying a pair of 250 kg (550 lb) bombs, destroyed an oil depot with no losses.<ref name="tupolev"/> On [[11 August]] and [[13 August]] [[1941]], ''Zveno-SPB'' successfully damaged the [[King Carol I Bridge]] over [[Danube]] in [[Romania]].<ref name="tupolev"/> Zveno operations ended in the fall of 1942 due to high vulnerability of the motherships.

In recognition of the role TB-3 played during the war, three aircraft were included in the first post-war air parade on [[18 June]] [[1945]].<ref name="tupolev"/>
