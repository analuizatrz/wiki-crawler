[[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard Entertainment's]] 1998 bestselling [[real-time strategy game]] series '''''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]''''' revolves around interstellar affairs in a distant sector of the galaxy, with three species and multiple factions all vying for supremacy in the sector. The original game has sold over 9.5 million copies<ref name="vivendi">{{cite web | url=http://www.vivendi.com/ir/download/pdf/VIVGames_EuropeRoadshow_June2006.pdf | title=Introduction to Vivendi games | date=June 2006 | publisher=[[Vivendi]] | accessdate=2006-11-26 | format=[[PDF]]}}</ref> internationally, making it one of the top selling games in the PC market. One of the reasons for ''StarCraft'''s success is its intricate story, carried by [[#Critical reception|generally positively received characters]] from the industry's reviewers and journalists. The ''StarCraft'' universe, comprising of a number of games, authorized additions and novels, has an extensive list of characters, but only a limited number of these characters have a major influence of the overall story arc.

Most of the main characters in the ''StarCraft'' series are put under the player's control at some point within the game to some degree; [[#Jim Raynor|Jim Raynor]] and [[#Fenix|Fenix]] are consistently controllable throughout the games, whilst others such as [[#Edmund Duke|Edmund Duke]] appear multiple times but are only accessible in-game to the player once or twice. Some characters, such as [[#Arcturus Mengsk|Arcturus Mengsk]] and [[#Aldaris|Aldaris]] are never put under the control of the player during the course of the games, but feature prominently in the lore of the series. The universe also contains a whole host of minor characters, but these characters are of much lesser significance within isolated areas of the general story.

==Casting and design==
[[Image:Over Reverent (StarCraft).jpg|thumb|170px|Extensive concept art was done for the lore of the series.]]
The characters and story of the [[StarCraft (series)|''StarCraft'' series]] were created by [[Chris Metzen]]<ref name="manual"/> and James Phinney.<ref name="manual"/> However, as Phinney was not involved in ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]''; Chris Metzen alone is credited for the development of the plot in the expansion.<ref name="BWmanual"/> Despite the series' success globally, particularly in [[South Korea]], Blizzard Entertainment has not made any major comments regarding the development of the characters and the storyline of the ''StarCraft'' series.

However, interviews with the two of the voice actors have given a glimpse into small parts of the development process. An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of [[#Jim Raynor|Jim Raynor]] in all released ''StarCraft'' games to date, has revealed that for the most part the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to four hours,<ref name="clotworthy">{{cite web| url=http://www.blizzplanet.com/content/699/| title=Interview with Robert Clotworthy |publisher= BlizzPlanet| accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref> a fact mirrored in a similar interview with [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Sarah Kerrigan's]] actress, [[Glynnis Talken Campbell]].<ref name="campbell">{{cite web| url=http://www.blizzplanet.com/content/63/| title=Interview with Glyniss Talken Campbell |publisher= BlizzPlanet| accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game - usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games - was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.<ref name="clotworthy"/>

Visually, most of the characters and units in the games were developed from artwork by Metzen and [[Samwise Didier]], although at least two other artists - Glen Rane and Peter Lee - have developed concept art for the upcoming ''[[StarCraft II]]''. It is also implied by some of the authors of the novels that the development of the characters in their books was also influenced by Metzen<ref name="ShadowAcknowledgements">{{cite book| last= Mesta| first=Gabriel|  title=StarCraft: Shadow of the Xel'Naga| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2001 |chapter=Acknowedgements}}</ref><ref name="QueenAcknowledgements">{{cite book| last= Rosenburg| first=Aaron|  title=StarCraft: Queen of Blades| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2006 |chapter=Acknowedgements}}</ref> as well as Andy Chambers and Evelyn Fredericksen.<ref name="golden">{{cite web| url=http://www.blizzplanet.com/content/683/| title=Interview with Christie Golden |publisher= BlizzPlanet| accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> This is particularly notable for characters later appearing in the games, such as [[#Valerian Mengsk|Valerian Mengsk]].

==Primary characters==
===Artanis===
[[Image:Artanis Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Artanis' in-game portrait from ''Brood War''.]]

'''Artanis''' is an advisor to the Protoss player in ''Brood War'' and a high-ranking Protoss official. Artanis holds the rank of praetor in the [[Protoss]] Defense Forces and at two hundred and sixty two years old<ref name="BWmanual"/> he is the youngest templar to achieve this rank.<ref name="BWmanual"/> An ambitious leader, Artanis holds [[#Tassadar|Tassadar]] in high esteem and despite being a strong believer in the Conclave<ref name ="BWmanual"/> the young Protoss also holds strongly to the idea of reunification with the dark templar. Initially appearing in ''[[StarCraft: Brood War|Brood War]]'', Artanis is voiced by Jack Ritschel<ref name="BWcasting"/> and pilots a scout-class [[starfighter]] in-game. In the novel ''[[StarCraft: Queen of Blades|Queen of Blades]]'' it is revealed that the executor the player takes the role of in ''StarCraft''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Episode III is actually Artanis prior to being made praetor in ''Brood War''.<ref name="QueenNovel"/> This was later confirmed in an article released by Blizzard summarising the events of ''StarCraft''.<ref name="Story1">{{cite web|url=http://eu.starcraft2.com/features/storysofar.xml|title=The Story So Far: Part 1:''StarCraft''|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|date=[[November 21]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

Through Episode IV of ''Brood War'', Artanis works with [[#Zeratul|Zeratul]] and [[#Aldaris|Judicator Aldaris]] to evacuate the Khalai Protoss to Shakuras and defend the world from the [[Zerg]]. During this time they receive unexpected aid from Sarah Kerrigan, but Artanis and Zeratul become furious at Kerrigan's true motives for being on Shakuras and her killing Aldaris.<ref name="ep4m8"/> Despite knowing that destroying the Zerg and its cerebrates on Shakuras will only strengthen her, Artanis and Zeratul activate the Xel'Naga temple on Shakuras,<ref name="ep4m8"/> annihilating the Zerg on the surface. Artanis does not appear again until the end of the game, in which he commands a fleet to bring Kerrigan to justice<ref name="ep6m10">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode VI, mission 10: "Omega"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_10 Transcript].</ref> for the Protoss deaths she is responsible for, but his forces meet defeat despite outnumbering Kerrigan's standing forces.

At Blizzcon in August 2007 it was revealed that Artanis holds the rank of hierarch and thereby is effectively the leader of the reunified Protoss in ''[[StarCraft II]]'', but is still struggling with reintegrating the two estranged branches of his people, as many of the Aiur survivors wish to retake their planet while the dark templar do not.<ref name="blizzcon07pt2">{{cite web| url=http://www.sclegacy.com/showthread.php?t=2889| title=Day 2 of Blizzcon | date=August 2007| publisher=''StarCraft'' Legacy | accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

===Samir Duran===
[[Image:Samir Duran Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Samir Duran's in-game portrait from ''Brood War''.]]

'''Samir Duran''' is one of the most mysterious beings in the ''StarCraft'' series. Throughout the game, Duran's character, alliances and motives change from the player's point of view. In a hidden mission, his role and true nature are made even more mysterious. Fan speculations link Duran to nearly every faction and character in the game, but the most common theory is that he is a [[Xel'Naga]]. Duran's voice is provided by Paul Ainsley<ref name="BWcasting"/> and he is represented in-game as a [[Psionic technology (StarCraft)#Ghost agents|ghost agent]] in both Terran and infested Terran forms, although the two subtly differ.

Duran first appears as a leader of an anti-[[Terran Dominion|Dominion]] resistance force early in ''Brood War'' Episode V,<ref name="ep5m1">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode V, mission 1: "First Strike"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_1 Transcript].</ref> and allies with the [[United Earth Directorate]]. Although Duran provides invaluable data on the Dominion to the UED, he also allows Zerg to overwhelm their strike forces on [[Aiur]], sabotaging the objectives of that mission and allowing the Dominion emperor to escape.<ref name="ep5m6">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode V, mission 6: "Emperor's Flight"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_6 Transcript].</ref> As a result, Vice-Admiral [[#Alexei Stukov|Alexei Stukov]] suspects him of being a traitor late in Episode V, at which point Duran kills him<ref name="ep5m7">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode V, mission 7: "Patriot's Blood"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_7 Transcript].</ref> and shows that he is working with [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Sarah Kerrigan]],<ref name="ep5m8">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode V, mission 8: "To Chain the Beast"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_8 Transcript].</ref> revealing himself as an infested Terran. With Duran as her advisor, Kerrigan successfully establishes herself as the dominant power in the sector, taking command of the majority of the Zerg Swarm in Episode VI. However, despite his valued assistance, Duran vanishes shortly before Kerrigan is attacked in ''Brood War'''s final mission. He is discovered by [[Zeratul]] in a secret mission on an unknown geological satellite, engineering a Protoss/Zerg hybrid.<ref name="ep6bonus"/> At this point Duran states clearly that his work has little to do with Kerrigan, and that he in fact serves what he describes as "a far greater power".

Due to a lack of appearances in any other media, Duran's true nature is a mystery, and Blizzard Entertainment has not elaborated on his character. What is for certain is that Duran is highly intelligent and manipulative, demonstrating a degree of knowledge of Protoss technology<ref name="ep6bonus">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Secret mission: "Dark Origin"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_bonus Transcript].</ref> and Zerg control hierarchy,<ref name="ep5m3">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode V, mission 3: "Ruins of Tarsonis"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_3 Transcript].</ref> along with inside knowledge of several Terran factions. He is able to fool the UED into thinking he is a thirty-three year old<ref name="BWmanual"/> human and Kerrigan into thinking he is infested when he is neither, although the means by which he accomplishes this are not known. Duran also claims to have "had many names throughout the millennia", displaying that he is far older than any other character in ''StarCraft''; even the extremely long lived Protoss rarely live over a single millennium.

===Sarah Kerrigan===
[[Image:Sarah Kerrigan Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Sarah Kerrigan's infested in-game portrait from ''StarCraft''.]]
{{main|Sarah Kerrigan}}

'''Sarah Kerrigan''' is a major character and the predominant villain in the ''[[StarCraft]]'' series. The twenty-six year old<ref name="manual"/> [[psychic]] female [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terran]] is initially the second-in-command of the Sons of Korhal but is abandoned by [[#Arcturus Mengsk|Arcturus Mengsk]] in the final stages of Episode I. In Episode II she is revealed to have been captured and infested by the [[Zerg]], and in the wake of the death of the [[#Zerg Overmind|Overmind]] at the end of the original ''StarCraft'', Kerrigan makes moves to consolidate her position as the supreme commander of the Zerg swarms. In both ''StarCraft''<ref name="casting"/> and [[StarCraft: Brood War|''Brood War'']]<ref name="BWcasting"/> Kerrigan's character is voiced by [[Glynnis Talken Campbell]]. In-game, Kerrigan appears as a [[Psionic technology (StarCraft)#Ghost agents|ghost agent]] and later as a unique infested Terran unit.

===Arcturus Mengsk===
[[Image:Arcturus Mengsk Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Arcturus Mengsk's in-game portrait from ''StarCraft''.]]

'''Arcturus Mengsk''' is a major character in the ''[[StarCraft]]'' series and commands the player's missions through most of Episode I. Aged thirty-eight,<ref name="manual"/> he becomes the emperor of the [[Terran Dominion]] and as such the ruler of the majority of the Terrans in the sector. The original ''StarCraft'' documents Mengsk's rise to power, and subsequent novels and games have depicted him as growing in strength. Mengsk was originally planned to appear in-game piloting the battlecruiser ''Leviathan'', but this idea was scrapped, although third party campaign editors still refer to his unit as a battlecruiser. Mengsk is voiced by Jason Hayes in both ''StarCraft''<ref name="casting"/> and ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]''.<ref name="BWcasting"/>

Prior to the events in ''StarCraft'', Mengsk's father, [[List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Angus Mengsk|Angus]], is assassinated by the Confederacy. Although Mengsk is initially not interested in war, he takes up his father's cause and rallies the survivors of his home planet to form a rebel faction, the Sons of [[Korhal]]. After several years of missions<ref name="manual"/> and terrorism<ref name="NovaNovel"/> to subvert Confederate rule over the Terrans, Mengsk successfully convinces the former inhabitants of Antiga Prime and Mar Sara to join him, making the Sons of Korhal strong enough to attack the Confederate capital, [[Tarsonis]]. Despite a successful campaign due to the advice of former Confederate general [[#Edmund Duke|Edmund Duke]], [[#Jim Raynor|Raynor]] and [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]] grow uneasy with Mengsk's increasingly extreme methods.<ref name="ep1m8">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode I, mission 8: "The Big Push"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e1_8 Transcript].</ref> Kerrigan is abandoned to the Zerg on Tarsonis<ref name="ep1m9"/> and as a result Raynor leaves the group near the end of the battle.<ref name="ep1m10">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode I, mission 10: "The Hammer Falls"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e1_10 Transcript].</ref> Mengsk returns to Korhal with Duke to found the Terran Dominion, portraying himself as a [[benevolent dictator]] in the wake of the Confederacy's destruction and convincing all Terran colonies in the sector to submit to his rule.<ref name="BWmanual"/>

In ''Brood War'', Mengsk and the Dominion are attacked by the [[United Earth Directorate]], and Mengsk narrowly escapes capture through the help of Raynor.<ref name="ep5m5a">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode V, mission 5a: "Emperor's Fall (Ground Zero)"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_5a Transcript].</ref> Faced with death and the destruction of the Dominion as alternatives, Mengsk allies with Kerrigan and Raynor to defeat the UED, but Kerrigan betrays their alliance and kills Duke,<ref name="ep6m5"/> crippling Mengsk's militia. Furious, Mengsk calls in favors to what he describes as "special interest groups",<ref name="ep6m10"/> forming a new fleet and attacking Kerrigan's orbital base at [[Char]]. Despite a desperate alliance with the UED and the Protoss, the fleet is defeated and Mengsk retreats back to Korhal to rebuild the Dominion, letting Kerrigan know that he will be there when she finally "slips up".<ref name="ep6m10"/> In novels set after ''StarCraft'', Mengsk still rules the Dominion and it is still the dominant Terran power in the Koprulu Sector. In ''[[StarCraft II]]'', Mengsk and his son [[#Valerian Mengsk|Valerian]] find the "evil empire" of the Dominion opposed by several (but numerically inferior) militia groups, including the forces of Jim Raynor.

===Jim Raynor===
[[Image:Jim Raynor Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Jim Raynor's in-game portrait from ''StarCraft''.]]
{{main|Jim Raynor}} 

'''James Raynor''', usually referred to as '''Jim''', is one of the central protagonists in the ''[[StarCraft]]'' series. He is a twenty-nine year old<ref name="manual"/> [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terran]], originally appearing as a [[Terran Confederacy|Confederate]] marshal from the colony of [[Mar Sara]].  Episode I of the original ''StarCraft'' follows Raynor's character as he joins the revolution against the Confederacy under the command of [[#Arcturus Mengsk|Arcturus Mengsk]], helping him overthrow the Confederacy for his new [[Terran Dominion]]. However, Mengsk betrays [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Sarah Kerrigan]] at the end of Episode I, after which Raynor abandons the newly styled emperor to form a [[paramilitary|paramilitary organization]], eventually allying himself with the Protoss. In both ''StarCraft''<ref name=" casting"/>and ''[[StarCraft: Brood War|Brood War]]'',<ref name="BWcasting"/> Raynor is voiced by Robert Clotworthy. Raynor normally appears in-game on a vulture scavenger bike, although he has also appeared in-game as a [[Space marine|marine]] unit and as the captain of the [[Space battleships and battlecruisers|battlecruiser]] ''Hyperion''.

===Alexei Stukov===<!-- Stukov is here due to raised importance as a result of Resurrection IV and his likely role in StarCraft II.  -->
[[Image:Alexei Stukov Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Alexei Stukov's in-game portrait from ''Brood War''.]]

'''Alexei Stukov''' is the [[vice admiral]] of the [[United Earth Directorate]]'s expeditionary force and a main advisor to the Terran player in ''Brood War'' alongside his childhood friend [[#Gerard DuGalle|Gerard DuGalle]].<ref name="BWmanual"/> A fifty-two year old<ref name="BWmanual"/> male [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terran]] of [[Russia]]n descent, Stukov is described as a brilliant tactician and has spent most of his career involved in secret military research<ref name="BWmanual"/> rather than actual combat. In-game Stukov appears as with the equipment of a [[Psionic technology (StarCraft)#Ghost agents|ghost agent]] despite the character not being psychic. [[Castulo Guerra]] provides the voice of Stukov in ''Brood War''.<ref name="BWcasting"/>

Stukov appears throughout Episode V of ''Brood War'', in which he accompanies discussion with DuGalle, but always gives in to the higher rank of his friend. However Stukov is consistently suspicious of the motives of [[#Samir Duran|Samir Duran]]<ref name="ep5m1"/> throughout the episode and discreetly disobeys the misinformed orders of DuGalle by preserving the [[Psionic technology (StarCraft)#Psi disruptor|psi disruptor]] on [[Tarsonis]]. After Duran causes the defeat of a UED strike force on [[Aiur]],<ref name="ep5m6"/> Stukov separates from the UED fleet and works to activate the reconstructed psi disruptor on [[Braxis]].<ref name="ep5m7"/> However, after convincing DuGalle that Stukov has betrayed the expedition, Duran takes a force into the disruptor and assassinates Stukov,<ref name="ep5m7"/> but not before Stukov manages to convince DuGalle that Duran is the traitor and to keep the psi disruptor running. Stukov's body is given a full funeral and propaganda was made to portray Stukov as a hero back on Earth, claiming he died in combat on the planet Char.<ref name="ep5movie">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode V, cinematic: "UED Victory Report"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_movie Transcript].</ref>

However, Stukov still continues to feature in the ''StarCraft'' series. In Blizzard's separate mission "Deception", the deceased vice admiral briefly reappears as an infested Terran, in a secret Confederate science facility which he proceeds to blow up.<ref name="deception">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 2000 | platform = PC | level = [http://www.battle.net/scc/OS/motm2000.shtml Map of the month: "Deception"]| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#re_1 Transcript].</ref> This infestation is also displayed in concept art by Samwise Didier.<ref name="deadstukov">{{cite web| url=http://www.sonsofthestorm.com/viewer_samwise.php?cat=starcraft&art=203&sub=199| title=Concept art depicting an infested Stukov |author=Didier, Samwise |date=1999 |publisher=Sons of Storm| accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> He later appears in another map of the month, "Mercenaries II", in which he hires several [[mercenary]] groups to destroy some of his adversaries.<ref name="mercenaries2">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 2001 | platform = PC | level = [http://www.battle.net/scc/OS/motm2001.shtml Map of the month: "Mercenaries II"]| language = English}}</ref> The reason for Stukov's resurrection is explained in the ''StarCraft 64'' secret mission "Resurrection IV", where it is revealed that he was infested by a cerebrate named Kaloth and is in command of the "New Swarm" on Braxis.<ref name="resurrection4">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 2000 | platform = N64 | level = Secret mission: "Resurrection IV"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#re_2 Transcript].</ref> As a result of this [[#Artanis|Artanis]] sends [[#Jim Raynor|Raynor]] and [[List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Taladrin|Taladrin]] to inject him with an experimental serum that can undo Zerg infestation.

===Tassadar===
[[Image:Tassadar Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Tassadar's in-game portrait from ''StarCraft''.]]

'''Tassadar''' is the primary protagonist of the Protoss campaign in ''StarCraft'' and the main advisor to the Protoss player. Tassadar is a three hundred and fifty-six year old<ref name="manual"/> male [[Protoss]] high templar, holding the rank of executor in the Protoss Defense Forces.<ref name="manual"/> Described as being fascinated with, if somewhat wary of,<ref name="QueenNovel"/> the dark templar, Tassadar is the commander of the fleet that made first contact with the [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terrans]] by sterilizing the surface of [[Chau Sara]] in order to contain [[Zerg]] infestation. However, he disregarded his order from the Conclave to repeat the act with [[Tarsonis]]; he tried to destroy the Zerg whilst attempting to spare the humans. Voiced by [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] in ''StarCraft'',<ref name="casting"/> the character is seen in-game as a high templar unit and later as the captain of the carrier ''Gantrithor''. The character of Tassadar also appears in ''[[StarCraft: Queen of Blades]]'',<ref name="QueenNovel"/> a novelisation of the events of Episode II. 

Throughout Episode I Tassadar's fleet follows the Zerg infestation across the sector, sterilizing the surfaces of Mar Sara and Antiga and attempting to engage the Zerg on the ground on [[Tarsonis]], but is prevented from doing so by the Sons of Korhal.<ref name="ep1m9">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode I, mission 9: "New Gettysburg"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e1_9 Transcript].</ref> It is not until Episode II that Tassadar reveals himself, conducting sorties against [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]] on Char.<ref name="ep2m6">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode II, mission 6: "The Dark Templar"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e2_6 Transcript].</ref> During this time he establishes a friendship with [[#Jim Raynor|Jim Raynor]]<ref name="QueenNovel"/> and [[#Zeratul|Zeratul]],<ref name="QueenNovel"/> learning how to use his [[psionic]] powers in conjunction with the powers of the dark templar from the older Protoss. Tassadar also learns the weaknesses of the Zerg cerebrates through Zeratul assassinating [[Zasz]].<ref name="ep3m2">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode III, mission 2: "Into the Flames"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e3_2 Transcript].</ref> By Episode III, Tassadar's involvement with the dark templar becomes seen as a bigger threat than the Zerg on [[Aiur]] by the Conclave,<ref name="ep3m4"/> who send Aldaris and [[#Artanis|Artanis]]<ref name="Story1"/> to arrest him. The player's forces side with Tassadar, sparking a civil war between templar forces led by [[#Fenix|Fenix]] and the Conclave's forces led by Aldaris.<ref name="ep3m7"/> Towards the end of Episode III Tassadar turns himself in to the Conclave in an attempt to stop the civil war, but Zeratul frees him from captivity.<ref name="ep3m8">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode III, mission 8: "The Trial of Tassadar"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e3_8 Transcript].</ref>

In the final missions of Episode III, Tassadar plans the assault on the [[#Zerg Overmind|Overmind]] with Zeratul, Fenix and Raynor, using the dark templar to weaken the Overmind's outer defences before launching a full scale assault on the primary Zerg hive cluster.<ref name="ep3m10"/> The battle costs the Protoss forces heavily, but in the closing moments of the game Tassadar channels the psionic energies he learnt from the dark templar along with his own Khala energies through the ''Gantrithor'' and crashes the capital ship into the Overmind.<ref name="ep3m10"/> The resulting discharge of energy kills Tassadar and completely disintegrates the Overmind. In ''Brood War'' and ''StarCraft II'', Tassadar's actions are revered by numerous Protoss in the honorary expression "En Taro Tassadar".<ref name="ep4m2"/>

===Zeratul===
[[Image:Zeratul Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Zeratul's in-game portrait from ''StarCraft''.]]
'''Zeratul''' is one of the primary [[Protoss]] characters in the ''[[StarCraft]]'' series. He is a six hundred and thirty-four year old<ref name="manual"/> dark templar [[prelate]], exiled from [[Aiur]] for refusing to submit to the Khala. His first appearance in-game is in Episode II of the original ''StarCraft'', in which he assassinates [[Zasz]] and befriends [[#Tassadar|Tassadar]]. During the later episodes he takes part in defeating the [[#Zerg Overmind|Overmind]] on Aiur and reuniting the dark templar with the rest of their people. He plays a major role in the expansion ''[[StarCraft: Brood War|Brood War]]'', as well as the upcoming sequel ''[[StarCraft II]]''. Zeratul is voiced by [[James Harper (voice actor)|James Harper]] in both ''StarCraft''<ref name="casting"/> and ''Brood War''<ref name="BWcasting"/> and appears in-game as a dark templar unit.

Zeratul is first introduced in the course of ''StarCraft'' Episode II, in which he uses a distraction caused by [[#Tassadar|Tassadar]] to assassinate the cerebrate [[Zasz]] on [[Char (StarCraft)|Char]],<ref name="ep2m7">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode II, mission 7: "The Culling"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e2_7 Transcript].</ref> accidentally revealing the location of [[Aiur]] to the [[#The Overmind|Overmind]] in the process. While on Char, he befriends Tassadar and [[#Jim Raynor|Raynor]], teaching Tassadar how to use dark templar powers in tandem with those of the [[Khala]].<ref name="QueenNovel"/> Later in Episode III he and a group of dark templar accompany Tassadar back to Aiur to aid the Protoss, but are hunted by [[#Aldaris|Aldaris]] and the Conclave as heretics. Despite this, he is able to free Tassadar from the captivity of the Conclave<ref name="ep3m8"/> and supported by [[#Fenix|Fenix's]] forces, personally assassinates two key cerebrates in the [[#The Overmind|Overmind's]] core defences.<ref name="ep3m9"/> Zeratul then participates in the end battle of ''StarCraft'' that results in the death of the Overmind and Tassadar.<ref name="ep3m10"/>

Taking a larger role in ''Brood War'', Zeratul leads the surviving Khalai Protoss to the dark templar homeworld of [[Shakuras]]. After it is realised that [[Zerg]] are also on Shakuras, Zeratul plans with his co-patriots of [[#Artanis|Artanis]], [[#Raszagal|Raszagal]] and Aldaris to activate a [[Xel'Naga]] temple on the surface to destroy the infestation.<ref name="ep4m3">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode IV, mission 3: "Legacy of the Xel'Naga"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e4_3 Transcript].</ref> Aided by [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]],<ref name="ep4m4"/> they are able to retrieve the crystals necessary for this and activate the temple,<ref name="ep4m8"/> but not before Kerrigan's ulterior motives are revealed and Aldaris is killed.<ref name="ep4m7"/> In the final missions of Episode VI Kerrigan uses Raszagal to blackmail Zeratul into slaying the new Overmind on [[Char]],<ref name="ep6m8"/> and afterwards Zeratul retrieves the brainwashed matriarch but is pursued by Kerrigan's forces. Realising that the damage to her mind cannot be undone, Zeratul kills Raszagal; Kerrigan, taken completely by surprise, allows Zeratul and his surviving forces to leave.<ref name="ep6m9"/> In the following secret mission "Dark Origin", Zeratul stumbles across a genetic engineering facility while searching for Artanis and learns of a Protoss/Zerg hybrid being engineered by [[#Samir Duran|Samir Duran]].<ref name="ep6bonus"/> At Blizzcon of 2007 it is revealed that Zeratul, troubled by this knowledge, begins searching for more clues in the time before ''[[StarCraft II]]''.<ref name="BlizzconVideoSP">{{cite video | people = Blizzard Entertainment | title = [http://www.gamespot.com/video/939643/6176222/ ''StarCraft II'' Under Construction] | medium = Development commentary | publisher = [[GameSpot]] | people=Pardo, Rob | date=August 2007 | location = Blizzcon | date = [[May 03]] [[2007]] | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}</ref>

===Aldaris===
[[Image:Aldaris Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Aldaris' in-game portrait from ''StarCraft''.]]

'''Aldaris''' is an advisor to the Protoss player in the first half of Episode III, but later becomes an enemy.<ref name="manual">{{cite book| last= Underwood| first=Peter| coauthors=Roper, Bill; Metzen, Chris; Vaughn, Jeffrey| title=StarCraft (manual)| location=Irvine, Calif. | publisher=Blizzard Entertainment| year=1998}}</ref> Aldaris is a judicator who acts as the Protoss Conclave's agent for contacting and ordering the player's character and their fleet.

A fanatical believer in the Khala,<ref name="manual"/> Aldaris is outraged when [[#Tassadar|Tassadar]] allies with the dark templar and perceives him to have turned his back on the Khala. After a failed attempt to capture the wayward templar during the middle of Episode III, Aldaris leads the Conclave forces in an attack on Tassadar's allies, taking him prisoner and putting him on trial for crimes of [[blasphemy]] and [[treason]]. [[#Zeratul|Zeratul]] interrupts the trial and rescues Tassadar, but allows a bitter Aldaris to escape. In the closing missions of the original game, Aldaris witnesses the rebels successful assault the [[Zerg|Zerg's]] core defences, and wishes them luck in their final battle.<ref name="ep3m10">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode III, mission 10: "Eye of the Storm"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e3_10 Transcript].</ref>

In ''Brood War'', Aldaris reluctantly allies with Zeratul and Raszagal<ref name = "BWmanual"/> when the Protoss flee [[Aiur]] and travel to [[Shakuras]].

===Gerard DuGalle===
[[Image:Gerard DuGalle Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Gerard DuGalle's in-game portrait from ''Brood War''.]]

'''Gerard DuGalle''' is the commander of the Terran player's fleet in Episode V and their primary advisor. DuGalle is an experienced battlefield commander and the most highly-decorated [[admiral]] in the [[United Earth Directorate]]. Aged sixty-four<ref name="BWmanual"/> and of [[France|French]] descent, he is the head of the expeditionary force sent to take control of the Koprulu Sector in ''StarCraft: Brood War''.<ref name="BWmanual">{{cite book| last= Underwood| first=Peter| coauthors=Roper, Bill; Metzen, Chris| title=StarCraft: Brood War (manual)| location=Irvine, Calif. | publisher=Blizzard Entertainment| year=1998}}</ref> DuGalle is voiced by [[James Harper (actor)|James Harper]].<ref name="BWcasting">{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296870/fullcredits#cast| title=Casting of ''StarCraft: Brood War'' | publisher = Internet Movie Database| accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> DuGalle is seen in-game in command of the [[Space battleships and battlecruisers|battlecruiser]] ''Aleksander''.

DuGalle is a staunch believer in the UED's mission and carries out his orders with precision. Despite a twelve-year age gap, he is also a childhood friend of his [[vice-admiral]], [[#Alexei Stukov|Alexei Stukov]].<ref name="BWmanual"/> Despite his experience, DuGalle is prone to believe faulty intelligence from [[#Samir Duran|Samir Duran]] throughout Episode V and thus causes Stukov to abandon the fleet.<ref name="ep5m6"/> DuGalle accepts Duran's theory that Stukov is a traitor and allows Duran to kill his friend,<ref name="ep5m7"/> only realizing his horrible mistake too late. The true traitor Duran vanishes after Stukov's death, but DuGalle is still successful in foiling Duran's plans for sabotage. He goes on to capture the Overmind and occupy the majority of the sector by the end of Episode V.<ref name="ep5m8"/> However, as a result of demoralization, limited manpower, and an alliance of enemies led by [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]], the fleet is slowly but surely pushed back throughout Episode VI, and when a last-ditch attempt to recapture [[Char (StarCraft)|Char]] fails, DuGalle and the fleet attempt to retreat. In ''Brood War'''s final cinematic, DuGalle composes a letter to his wife, informing her of the fleet's failure and taking full responsibility for Stukov's death.<ref name="DuGalleletter">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode VI, cinematic: "The Ascension"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_movie1 Transcript of DuGalle's suicide note].</ref> DuGalle then commits suicide by a gunshot to the head, after which the UED fleet is overtaken by Zerg and destroyed.

===Edmund Duke===
[[Image:Edmund Duke Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Edmund Duke's in-game portrait from ''StarCraft''.]]

'''Edmund Duke''' acts as a figurehead for the [[Terran Confederacy]] and later the [[Terran Dominion]] in ''StarCraft'' and ''Brood War'', and is usually perceived as an enemy by the player's allies in both games. Duke is initially a [[colonel]] in the Confederate Security Forces and is later promoted to [[general]],<ref name="Story1"/> but during the course of ''StarCraft'' Episode I Duke defects with his forces, Alpha Squadron, to the Sons of Korhal. The fifty-three year old<ref name="manual"/> Terran is voiced by [[Chris Metzen]] in both ''StarCraft''<ref name="casting"/> and ''Brood War''.<ref name="BWcasting"/> 
A member of one of the influential Confederate Old Families, Duke is portrayed in the games and the novels as a "by the book" leader<ref name="manual"/> but also as a humorless and xenophobic man. Despite this, he is considered by other characters as a competent military commander. Comparisons have been drawn between Duke and the U.S. Army General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]].<ref name="DukeTrivia">{{cite web| url=http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Edmund_Duke#Trivia| title=Trivia on Edmund Duke | publisher=''StarCraft'' Wiki| accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> Duke's character first appears in the ''StarCraft'' prequel campaign ''Loomings'',<ref name="ep0m4">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = ''Loomings'', mission 4: "Force of Arms"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e0_4 Transcript].</ref> defending the colony of Chau Sara, where he appears as a [[tank|siege tank]] commander. In ''StarCraft'' and ''Brood War'', Duke is always in command of a [[Space battleships and battlecruisers|battlecruiser]].

Mengsk convinces Duke to defect, and the general's knowledge becomes vital to the assault on [[Tarsonis]] towards the end of Episode I. After Episode I Duke only makes sporadic appearances, heading up a [[Terran Dominion]] task force to Char in Episode II,<ref name="ep2m3">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode II, mission 3: "The New Dominion"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e2_3 Transcript].</ref> an expedition that fails its objectives and drags on into Episode III.<ref name="ep3m5">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode III, mission 5: "Choosing Sides"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e3_5 Transcript].</ref> In ''Brood War'' Duke's role is reduced even further, appearing to defend the Dylarian shipyards from the UED<ref name="ep5m2">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode V, mission 2: "The Dylarian Shipyards"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e5_2 Transcript].</ref> early in Episode V and later in [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Sarah Kerrigan's]] alliance in Episode VI.

Duke is also a main character in ''[[StarCraft: Shadow of the Xel'Naga]]'', in which Alpha Squadron is decimated by a Xel'Naga ''energy creature''<ref name="ShadowNovel">{{cite book| last= Mesta| first=Gabriel|  title=StarCraft: Shadow of the Xel'Naga| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2001}}</ref> and as a result he and his surviving forces are merged into Mengsk's Elite Guard for ''Brood War''.

===Fenix===
[[Image:Fenix Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Fenix's in-game portrait as a dragoon from ''StarCraft'']]

'''Fenix''' is a veteran Protoss warrior and a field commander of the Protoss player's forces in ''StarCraft''. Fenix is a three hundred and ninety-seven year old<ref name="manual"/> male [[Protoss]] templar and is an old friend of [[#Tassadar|Tassadar]].<ref name="manual"/> A praetor in the Protoss Defense Forces, he is described as a powerful and cunning leader who is distrustful of the motives of the judicator caste.<ref name="manual"/> Fenix initially appears in-game as a zealot ground warrior, although he later features as a dragoon unit after being mortally wounded and revived. [[Bill Roper]] voices Fenix in both ''StarCraft''<ref name="casting"/> and ''[[StarCraft: Brood War|Brood War]]''.<ref name="BWcasting"/>

Fenix first appears in the early missions of ''StarCraft'' Episode III, in which he joins the player and [[#Aldaris|Aldaris]] in the defense of [[Aiur]] against the [[Zerg]], but during one mission Fenix's forces in the province of Antioch are attacked by overwhelming Zerg numbers and he is believed to have been killed.<ref name="ep3m4">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode III, mission 4: "The Hunt for Tassadar"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e3_5 Transcript].</ref> However, true to the style of his namesake, the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], his mortally wounded body is retrieved and he is "reborn" as a part of a mechanical dragoon unit,<ref name="ep3m7">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode III, mission 7: "Homeland"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e3_7 Transcript].</ref> much to the surprise of Tassadar towards the end of the episode. Allying his forces with Tassadar, Fenix leads the campaign against the Conclave in a brief civil war on Aiur, later leading a task force against the [[#Zerg Overmind|Overmind's]] outer defences, facilitating [[#Zeratul|Zeratul's]] assassination of a number of cerebrates. Despite being present in the briefing,<ref name="ep3m10"/> Fenix does not take part in the final battle of the original ''StarCraft''.

In ''Brood War'', Fenix's character normally accompanies [[#Jim Raynor|Jim Raynor]]; it quickly becomes apparent that the two have developed a strong friendship in their time together. During Episode IV, Fenix's forces stay behind on Aiur to secure the warp gate to Shakuras,<ref name="ep4m2">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode IV, mission 2: "Dunes of Shakuras"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e4_2 Transcript].</ref> and are not seen again until mid-way through Episode V when the [[United Earth Directorate|UED]] engages his forces around the warp gate.<ref name="ep5m6"/> In Episode VI, Fenix features as part of Kerrigan's alliance, even leading the Zerg forces on a raiding mission to [[Moria (StarCraft)|Moria]].<ref name="ep6m3">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode VI, mission 3: "The Kel-Morian Combine"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_3 Transcript].</ref> However, after the UED is routed from [[Korhal|Korhal IV]], Kerrigan turns on her allies and Fenix is killed<ref name="ep6m5"/> when the Protoss base camp on Korhal is attacked. After the announcement of ''[[StarCraft II]]'', it was rumored that Fenix would be revived again, but Blizzard Entertainment has denied this.

===Valerian Mengsk===
[[Image:Valerian Mengsk Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Valerian Mengsk in concept art for ''StarCraft II''.]]

===Nova===
[[Image:Nova Terra Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Nova as she appears in the ''StarCraft: Ghost'' cinematic trailer.]]

'''November Annabella Terra''',<ref name="NovaNovel">{{cite book| last= DeCandido| first=Keith R. A.|  title=StarCraft Ghost: Nova| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2006}}</ref> normally known by her codename '''Nova''', is a ghost agent for the [[Terran Dominion]], and the protagonist of the ''[[StarCraft: Ghost]]'' sub-series. Despite the postponement of the ''Ghost'' game, her character still continues through ''[[StarCraft Ghost: Nova]]'', a novel covering Nova's early life that was meant to accompany the game's release.<ref name="NovaNovelFore">{{cite book| last= DeCandido| first=Keith R. A.| chapter=Foreword | title=StarCraft Ghost: Nova| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=2006}}</ref> 

According to ''StarCraft Ghost: Nova'', Nova is the daughter of one of the highly influential [[Terran Confederacy|Confederate]] Old Families,<ref name="NovaNovel"/> and despite having unusually high psionic potential her father is able to prevent her from being taken into the Confederate Ghost Program.<ref name="NovaNovel"/> However, after her family is murdered by an anti-Confederate resistance movement, Nova flees to the undercity of [[Tarsonis]] and is forced to work for an organised crime boss who wants to utilise her psionic powers for his ends. During the Zerg assault on Tarsonis at the end of ''StarCraft'''s Episode I, a Confederate wrangler eventually tracks her down and is able to get her off the planet, inadvertently ending up in the Sons of Korhal fleet.<ref name="NovaNovel"/> As a result, Nova voluntarily trains as a Dominion ghost agent and has her memory wiped to remove the reminders of her family's murder and her involvement with the Tarsonis underworld.<ref name="NovaNovel"/>

Due to the postponement of the ''StarCraft: Ghost'' game, Nova has not been featured in any mediums since. However, it has  been speculated that Nova may have a role in ''[[StarCraft II]]'' as her armour discretely appears in concept art<ref name="sc2mengskart">{{cite web| url=http://eu.starcraft2.com/images/artwork/ss13-hires.jpg| title=Concept art of Arcturus Mengsk for ''StarCraft II''.| publisher=Blizzard Entertainment |date=2007 | accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> depicting Arcturus Mengsk.

===The Overmind===
[[Image:Overmind Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|The Overmind's in-game portrait from ''StarCraft''.]]

The '''Overmind''' is the original leader of the [[Zerg|Zerg Swarm]] and the center of their [[Hive mind|hive-mind]] society.<ref name="manual"/> According to the contextual history of the game, the Xel'Naga wanted to make sure the Zerg did not suffer from problems arising from individual egos like the Protoss had, and so created the Overmind to act as a single consciousness. However, the Overmind grows at an exponential rate, becoming sentient and aware of its masters.<ref name="manual"/> After luring a space-faring race to the Zerg homeworld Zerus and assimilating them, the Overmind attacks the Xel'Naga fleet and assimilates many of them<ref name="manual"/> and learns of their experiments on the Protoss.

The Zerg travel from planet to planet, assimilating creatures and becoming stronger, but the Overmind desires the assimilation of the Protoss above all else, believing that such an action will result in perfection for the Zerg.<ref name="manual"/> During the first half of ''StarCraft'', the Zerg and Protoss clash on various Terran worlds until the dark templar [[#Zeratul|Zeratul]] kills the cerebrate [[List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Zasz|Zasz]].

===Raszagal===
[[Image:Raszagal Portrait (StarCraft).gif|right|Raszagal's in-game portrait from ''Brood War''.]]

'''Raszagal''' is a Protoss character in ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]'', taking the position of the matriarch of the dark templar.<ref name="BWmanual"/> At one thousand and forty-five years old<ref name="BWmanual"/> the female Protoss is one of the oldest Protoss observed in the ''StarCraft'' universe. During the ''Brood War'' Protoss campaign, Raszagal gives the player missions and orders whilst the focus of the storyline is on [[Shakuras]]. Debra Deliso voices the character of Raszagal in ''Brood War''.<ref name="BWcasting"/> Raszagal is represented in-game as a dark templar unit.

Raszagal's character is revealed in the early missions of ''Brood War'', directing the player to objectives that eventually leads to the activation of the [[Xel'Naga]] temple on Shakuras. However, whilst the player's character, along with [[#Zeratul|Zeratul]] and [[#Artanis|Artanis]] are recovering the crystals necessary to activate the temple during the course of Episode IV, the judicator [[#Aldaris|Aldaris]] learns that [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]] is holding mental sway over the matriarch and starts an open revolt against the dark templar on Shakuras. Upon Artanis' and Zeratul's return to the planet late in Episode IV, Raszagal orders the termination of Aldaris.<ref name="ep4m7"/> Aldaris is eventually killed by [[Sarah_Kerrigan|Kerrigan]], and despite Zeratul's growing suspicions of Raszagal,<ref name="ep4m7"/> the temple is activated in the final mission of Episode IV, annihilating the Zerg on the surface.<ref name="ep4m8">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode IV, mission 8: "Countdown"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e4_8 Transcript].</ref>

The matriarch does not feature in the game again until the late stages of Episode VI, when Kerrigan and [[#Samir Duran|Duran]] abduct her from a fortified outpost on Shakuras.<ref name="ep6m7">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode VI, mission 7: "Drawing of the Web"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_7 Transcript].</ref> Kerrigan then uses Raszagal to persuade Zeratul to assassinate the second Zerg Overmind,<ref name="ep6m8">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode VI, mission 8: "To Slay the Beast"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_8 Transcript].</ref> after which it is revealed that Raszagal had been controlled by Kerrigan since before the events of Episode IV<ref name="ep6m8"/> and that Raszagal was following Kerrigan's objectives for dominance. However, Zeratul's forces recapture Raszagal, but are unable to hold off the Zerg forces long enough to escape. Realising that Raszagal is beyond redemption from Kerrigan's influence, Zeratul kills Raszagal.<ref name="ep6m9">{{cite video game | title = [[StarCraft: Brood War]] | developer = Blizzard Entertainment | date = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode VI, mission 9: "The Reckoning"| language = English}} [http://www.sclegacy.com/encyclopedia/starcraft_story.php#e6_9 Transcript].</ref> Razagal's mind is freed by the lethal blow, and she dies thanking Zeratul for releasing her, naming him as her successor as leader of the dark templar.

Raszagal makes a brief appearance in the novel ''Shadow Hunters'' as the first dark templar to be captured and questioned by [[Adun]] in his mission to exterminate the dissident Protoss, and it is ultimately her testimony that convinces the high templar to spare the dark templar.<ref name="hunternovel"/>

==Minor characters==
{{main|List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe}}
In addition to the main characters, the ''StarCraft'' series also has a significant roster of supporting characters. These characters are usually main characters in their prospective source - for example, [[List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Michael Liberty|Michael Liberty]] is the central character to ''[[StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade]]'' and [[List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Jack Frost|Jack Frost]] is a key character in ''[[Insurrection (StarCraft)|Insurrection]]'' - but do not have any major influence on the overall storyline outside these mediums. Whilst their contributions are noteworthy in expanding the universe, they can be regarded as minor characters within the entirety of the ''StarCraft'' series.

===Critical reception===

The characters and story of the ''StarCraft'' series have been received with praise and only minute criticism by many game reviewers. The [[GameSpot]] review of ''StarCraft'' described the voice acting as "great", stating that it brings the characters to life.<ref name="gamespotSC">{{cite web| url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starcraft/review.html| title=''StarCraft'' for PC review |author = Dulin, Ron |publisher=GameSpot | date=April 1998 | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> GameSpot goes further in the review for ''Brood War'', commenting that the story and dialogue is with only a few exceptions "brilliantly written" and "one the year's best stories in any gaming genre".<ref name="gamespotBW">{{cite web| url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starcraft/review.html| title=''StarCraft: Brood War'' for PC review |publisher=GameSpot| author=Saggeran, Vik | date=December 1998 | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> The reviewer of ''StarCraft'' for [[IGN]] praises the melding of the story into the gameplay and implies that the development of the characters during the course of the story, particularly that of [[#Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]], is unforgettable.<ref name="ignSC">{{cite web| url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/152/152159p1.html| title=''StarCraft'' review |author = Chick, Tom |publisher=IGN | date=June 2000 | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> In addition, the review of ''Brood War'' puts the storyline as "solid".<ref name="ignBW">{{cite web| url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/152/152159p1.html| title=''StarCraft: Brood War'' review |author = Chen, Jeffrey |publisher=IGN | date=June 2002 | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>

''Gaming Revolution'' echoed this praise, saying the plot is "fantastic", but the reviewer added that he felt it was "over too quickly".<ref name="GamingRevolutionSC">{{cite web| url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/152/152159p1.html| title=''StarCraft'' review for the PC |publisher=Gaming Revolution | date=May 1998 | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> At ''GamePro.com'', the reviewer cited that he felt "the characters were talking to me" and even expressed a development of an emotional attachment to the character of [[#Jim Raynor|Raynor]].<ref name="gameproSC">{{cite web| url=http://www.gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/818.shtml| title=''StarCraft'' for PC review |author = Olafson, Peter |publisher=GamePro.com | date=November 2000 | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> ''Electric Playground'' put the story as the best part of the game, if a little derivative, but described the voice acting as "really quite excellent".<ref name="electricplaygroundSC">{{cite web| url=http://www.elecplay.com/reviews_article.php?article=463| title=''StarCraft'' review |publisher=Electric Playground |author=Shaw, John | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>
