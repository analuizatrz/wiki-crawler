''' Scorpions''' are eight-legged [[carnivorous]] [[arthropod]]s, members of the order '''Scorpiones''' within the class [[Arachnida]]. There are about 2000 species of scorpions, found widely distributed south of about [[Latitude|49° N]], except [[New Zealand]] and [[Antarctica]]. The northernmost part of the world where scorpions live in the wild is [[Sheerness]] on the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in the [[UK]], where a small colony of ''[[Euscorpius flavicaudis]]'' has been resident since the 1860s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Benton |first=T.

==Anatomy==

The body of a scorpion is divided into two parts: the [[cephalothorax]] (also called the prosoma) and the [[abdomen]] (opisthosoma). The abdomen consists of the [[mesosoma]] and the [[metasoma]].

===Cephalothorax===
The cephalothorax, also called the prosoma, is the scorpion's “head”, comprising the [[carapace]], [[eye]]s, [[chelicerae]] (mouth parts), [[pedipalp]]s ([[claw]]s) and four pairs of [[arthropod leg|walking legs]]. The scorpion's exoskeleton is thick and durable, providing good protection from predators.

===Mesosoma===
The mesosoma, the front half of the abdomen, is made up of six segments. The first segment contains the [[sex organ|sexual organs]] as well as a pair of vestigial and modified appendages forming a structure called the genital operculum. The second segment bears a pair of featherlike [[sensor]]y organs known as the ''pectines''; the final four segments each contain a pair of [[book lung]]s. The mesosoma is [[armor]]ed with [[chitin]]ous plates, known as [[tergites]] on the upper surface and  [[sternites]] on the lower surface.

===Metasoma=== 
The metasoma, the scorpion's [[tail (anatomy)|tail]], comprises six segments (the first tail segment looks like a last mesosoman segment), the last containing the scorpion's [[anus]] and bearing the [[telson]] (the [[sting (biology)|sting]]). The telson, in turn, consists of the [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]], which holds a pair of [[venom]] glands, and the hypodermic aculeus, the venom-injecting barb.

[[Image:Scorpion 006.jpg|230px|thumb|''E. mingrelicus'']]

On rare occasions, scorpions can be born with two metasomata ([[tail]]s). Two-tailed scorpions are not a different species, merely a genetic abnormality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sasionline.org/pepe.htm |title=Pepe the Two Tailed Scorpion |accessdate=2008-06-13 |last=Prchal |first=Steve |publisher=Sonoran Arthropod Studies Institute}}</ref>

==Reproduction==

Most scorpions reproduce sexually, and most species have male and female individuals. However, some species, such as ''[[Hottentotta hottentotta]]'', ''[[Hottentotta caboverdensis]]'', ''[[Liocheles australasiae]]'', ''[[Tityus columbianus]]'', ''[[Tityus metuendus]]'', ''[[Tityus serrulatus]]'', ''[[Tityus stigmurus]]'', ''[[Tityus trivittatus]]'', and ''[[Tityus urugayensis]]'', reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]], a process in which unfertilized eggs develop into living [[embryo]]s. Parthenogenic reproduction starts following the scorpion's final moult to maturity and continues thereafter.

Sexual reproduction is accomplished by the transfer of a [[spermatophore]] from the [[male]] to the [[female]]; scorpions possess a complex [[courtship]] and [[mating]] ritual to effect this transfer. Mating starts with the [[male]] and [[female]] locating and identifying each other using a mixture of [[pheromones]] and [[oscillation|vibration]]al communication; once they have satisfied each other that they are of opposite sex and of the correct species, mating can commence.

The courtship starts with the male grasping the female’s pedipalps with his own; the pair then perform a "dance" called the "promenade à deux". In reality this is the male leading the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his [[spermatophore]]. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviours such as [[juddering]] and a cheliceral kiss, in which the male's chelicerae--clawlike mouthparts--grasp the female's in a smaller more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps and in some cases injecting a small amount of his venom into her pedipalp or on the edge of her cephalothorax,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hickman Jr. |first=Cleveland P. |coauthors=Larry S. Roberts, Allan Larson, Helen I'Anson, David Eisenhour |title=Integrated Principles of Zoology |edition=13 |date=2005-02-01 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math |isbn=978-0073101743 |pages=380}}</ref> probably as a means of pacifying the female.

When he has identified a suitable location, he deposits the spermatophore and then guides the female over it. This allows the spermatophore to enter her [[genital opercula]], which triggers release of the sperm, thus fertilizing the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours and depends on the ability of the male to find a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. If mating goes on for too long, the female may eventually lose interest, breaking off the process.

Once the mating is complete, the male and female will separate. The male will generally retreat quickly, most likely to avoid being cannibalized by the female, although sexual [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]] is infrequent with scorpions.

==Birth and development==

[[Image:scorpionwithyoung.JPG|250px|right|thumb|''Compsobuthus werneri'' female with young]]

Unlike the majority of [[Arachnida|arachnid]] species, scorpions are [[viviparous]]. The young are born one by one, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one [[ecdysis|moult]]. Before the first moult, scorplings cannot survive naturally without the mother, since they depend on her for protection and to regulate their moisture levels. Especially in species which display more advanced sociability (e.g ''[[Pandinus]]'' spp.), the young/mother association can continue for an extended period of time. The size of the litter depends on the species and environmental factors, and can range from two to over a hundred scorplings. The average litter however, consists of around 8 scorplings.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lourenco |first=W. R. |year=2000 |title=Reproduction in scorpions, with special reference to parthenogenesis |journal=European Arachnology |pages=71–85}}</ref>

The young generally resemble their parents. Growth is accomplished by periodic shedding of the exoskeleton ([[ecdysis]]). A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in [[instars]] (how many moults it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Moulting is effected by means of a split in the old [[exoskeleton]] which takes place just below the edge of the carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split; the pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the [[metasoma]]. When it emerges, the scorpion’s new [[exoskeleton]] is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion must constantly stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called [[sclerotization]]. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce; as [[sclerotization]] occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.

==Life and habits==

Scorpions have quite variable lifespans and the actual lifespan of most species is not known. The age range appears to be approximately 4-25 years (25 years being the maximum reported life span in the species ''Hadrurus arizonensis''). Lifespan of ''Hadogenes'' species in the wild is estimated at 25-30 years.

Scorpions prefer to live in areas where the temperatures range from 20°C to 37°C (68°F to 99°F), but may survive from freezing temperatures to the desert heat.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hadley |first=Neil F. |year=1970 |title=Water Relations of the Desert Scorpion, ''Hadrurus Arizonensis'' |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=53 |pages=547–558 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/53/3/547.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoshino |first=K. |coauthors=A.

They  are [[nocturnal]] and [[fossorial]], finding shelter during the day in the relative cool of underground holes or undersides of rocks and coming out at night to hunt and feed. Scorpions exhibit [[photophobia|photophobic]] behavior, primarily to evade detection by their predators such as birds, centipedes, lizards, mice, possums, and rats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/scorpions.htm |title=Scorpions |accessdate=2008-06-13 |publisher=Australian Museum}}</ref>

Scorpions are opportunistic predators of small arthropods and insects. They use their chelae (pincers) to catch the prey initially. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with [[neurotoxic]] venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have a relatively unique style of eating using [[chelicerae]], small claw-like structures that protrude from the mouth that are unique to the [[Chelicerata]] among arthropods. The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion. Scorpions can only digest food in a liquid form; any solid matter (fur, [[exoskeleton]], etc) is disposed of by the scorpion.

==Venom==

All scorpion species possess [[venom (poison)|venom]]. In general, scorpion venom is described as [[Neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] in nature. One exception to this generalization is ''[[Hemiscorpius lepturus]]'' which possesses [[cytotoxic]] venom. The neurotoxins consist of a variety of small [[protein]]s as well as sodium and potassium [[cation]]s, which serve to interfere with neurotransmission in the victim. Scorpions use their venom to kill or paralyze their prey so that it can be eaten; in general it is fast-acting, allowing for effective prey capture. The effects of the sting can be severe.

Scorpion venoms are optimized for action upon other [[arthropod]]s and therefore most scorpions are relatively harmless to [[human]]s; stings produce only local effects (such as pain, numbness or swelling). A few scorpion species, however, mostly in the family [[Buthidae]], can be dangerous to humans. Among the most dangerous are ''[[Leiurus quinquestriatus]]'', otherwise ominously known as the deathstalker, which has the most potent venom in the family, and members of the genera ''[[Parabuthus]]'', ''[[Tityus]]'', ''[[Centruroides]]'', and especially ''[[Fattail scorpion|Androctonus]]'', which also have powerful venom. The scorpion which is responsible for the most human deaths is ''[[Fattail scorpion|Androctonus australis]]'', or the yellow fat-tailed scorpion, of [[North Africa]]. The toxicity of ''A. australis''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s venom is roughly half that of ''L. quinquestriatus,'' but despite a common misconception ''A. australis'' does not inject noticeably more venom into its prey. The higher death count is simply due to its being found more commonly, especially near humans. Human deaths normally occur in the young, elderly, or infirm; scorpions are generally unable to deliver enough venom to kill healthy adults. Some people, however, may be [[allergic]] to the venom of some species. Depending on the severity of the allergy, the scorpion's sting may cause [[anaphylaxis]] and death. A primary symptom of a scorpion sting is numbing at the injection site, sometimes lasting for several days. Scorpions are generally harmless and timid, and only voluntarily use their sting for killing prey, defending themselves or in territorial disputes with other scorpions. Generally, they will run from danger or remain still.

Scorpions are able to regulate how much venom is injected with each sting using striated muscles in the stinger, the usual amount being between 0.1 and 0.6 mg. There is also evidence to suggest that scorpions restrict the use of their venom using it only to subdue large prey, or prey that struggles. It has been found that scorpions have two types of venom: a translucent, weaker venom designed to stun only, and an opaque, more potent venom designed to kill heavier threats. This is likely because it is expensive in terms of energy for a scorpion to produce venom, and because it may take several days for a scorpion to replenish its venom supply once it has been exhausted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2081.htm |title=Scorpion Sting |accessdate=2008-06-13 |last=Cheng |first=David |coauthors=Judith A Dattaro & Ramy Yakobi |date=2007-11-08 |publisher=eMedicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Rein |first=Jan Ove |year=1993 |title=Sting use in two species of ''Parabuthus'' scorpions (Buthidae) |journal=The Journal of Arachnology |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=60–63 |url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v21_n1/JoA_v21_p60.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>

There is currently no scorpion equivalent of the [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]], because nobody has yet classified the levels of pain inflicted by different scorpion stings. This is probably because of the risk involved with some species, such as ''[[Fattail scorpion|Androctonus australis]]'' or ''[[Leiurus quinquestriatus]]''. However, envenomation by a mildly venomous species like ''[[Pandinus imperator]]'' or ''[[Heterometrus spinifer]]'' is similar to a bee sting in terms of the pain and swelling that results. A sting on the [[thumb]] from a relatively non-dangerous scorpion often feels like the victim has accidentally struck their thumb with a hammer whilst driving in a nail. A sting on the thumb from a truly dangerous scorpion can feel much worse, as though the victim had hammered a nail right ''through'' their thumb.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} It should be noted that the physical effects of a sting from a medically significant scorpion are not limited to the pain inflicted: there can be [[bradycardia]], [[tachycardia]] or in severe cases [[pulmonary edema]].

The stings of North American scorpions are rarely serious and usually result in pain, minimal swelling, tenderness, and warmth at the sting site. However, the [[Arizona bark scorpion]] ''Centruroides sculpturatus'', which is found in Arizona and New Mexico and on the California side of the Colorado River, has a much more toxic sting. The sting is painful, sometimes causing numbness or tingling in the area around the sting. Serious symptoms are more common in children and include abnormal head, eye, and neck movements; increased saliva production; sweating; and restlessness. Some people develop severe involuntary twitching and jerking of muscles. Breathing difficulties may occur. 

The stings of most North American scorpions require no special treatment. Placing an ice cube on the wound reduces pain, as does an ointment containing a combination of an antihistamine, an analgesic, and a corticosteroid. Centruroides stings that result in serious symptoms may require the use of sedatives, such as midazolam, given intravenously. Centruroides antivenom rapidly relieves symptoms, but it may cause a serious allergic reaction or serum sickness. The antivenom is available only in Arizona. In Trinidad the leaf juice of Eclipta prostrata is used for scorpion stings. Any effect of plants that are used against scorpion stings may be due to symptomatic relief – analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipruritic effects, in addition to other biological activities. Some compounds from plants used for general inflammation also inhibit enzymes (like phospholipase A2) from snake and scorpion venom. Some of these plant compounds are hypolaetin-8-glucoside and related flavanoids.

Professor [[Moshe Gueron]] was the first to investigate the cardiovascular effects of a severe scorpion sting.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} Thousands of stung patients were reviewed. Thirty-four patients with severe scorpion stings were reviewed and pertinent data related to the cardiovascular system such as hypertension, peripheral vascular collapse, congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema were analyzed. The electrocardiograms of 28 patients were reviewed; 14 patients showed "early myocardial infarction-like" pattern. The urinary catecholamine metabolites were investigated in 12 patients with scorpion sting. Vanylmandelic acid was elevated in seven patients and the total free epinephrine and norepinephrine in eight. Six of these 12 patients displayed the electrocardiographic "myocardial infarction-like" pattern. Nine patients died and the pathologic lesions of the myocardium were reviewed in seven. Also, Gueron reported five cases of Severe Myocardial damage and heart failure in Scorpion sting from [[Beer-Sheba]], [[Israel]]. He described hypertension, pulmonary oedema with hypertension, hypotension, pulmonary oedema with hypotension and rhythm disturbances as five different syndromes that may dominate the clinical picture in scorpion sting victim. He suggested that all patients with cardiac symptoms should be admitted to an intensive cardiac unit. A few years later, in 1990, he reported poor contractility with low ejection fraction, decreased systolic left ventricular performance, lowered fractional percentage shortening observed in echocardiographic and radionuclide angiographic study. Gueron was questioned regarding the value of giving antivenom, and he replied that although it is freely available, all cases of scorpion sting are treated without it, and there had not been a single fatality in 1989.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bawaskar |first=H. S. |title=Scorpion Sting: Clinical Manifestations, Management and Literature |date=[[1999-03-15]] |publisher=Sangam Books Ltd |isbn=978-8171547180}}</ref>

==Fossil record==
Scorpions have been found in many [[fossil record]]s, including marine [[Silurian]] deposits, coal deposits from the [[Carboniferous Period]] and in [[amber]]. They are thought to have existed in some form since about 430 million years ago. They are believed to have an oceanic origin, with gills and a claw-like appendage that enabled them to hold onto rocky shores or [[seaweed]], although the assumption that the oldest scorpions were aquatic has been questioned. Currently, 111 fossil species of scorpion are known. Unusually for arachnids, there are more species of [[Palaeozoic]] scorpion than [[Mesozoic]] or [[Cenozoic]] ones.  

The ''[[Eurypterida|eurypterids]]'', [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] creatures which lived during the [[Paleozoic]] era, share several physical traits with scorpions and may be closely related to them. Various species of Eurypterida could grow to be anywhere from 10 cm (4 in) to 2.5 m (8 ft) in length. However, they exhibit [[anatomy|anatomical]] differences marking them off as a group distinct from their Carboniferous and Recent relatives. Despite this, they are commonly referred to as "sea scorpions."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/arthropoda/chelicerata/eurypterida.html |title=Eurypterida |accessdate=2008-06-13 |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |publisher=Regents of the University of California}}</ref> Their legs are thought to have been short, thick, tapering and to have ended in a single strong claw; it appears that they were well-adapted for maintaining a secure hold upon rocks or seaweed against the wash of waves, like the legs of shore-[[crab]].

==Geographical distribution==
[[Image:Bark Scorpion.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''Hadrurus spadix'' - Caraboctonidae, Hadrurinae]]
Scorpions are almost universally distributed south of 49° N, and their geographical distribution shows in many particulars a close and interesting correspondence with that of the [[mammal]]s, including their entire absence from [[New Zealand]]. The facts of their distribution are in keeping with the hypothesis that the order originated in the [[northern hemisphere]] and migrated southwards into the southern continent at various epochs, their absence from the countries to the north of the above-mentioned latitudes being due, no doubt, to the comparatively recent [[glaciation]] of those areas. When they reached [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]] was part of that continent; but their arrival in [[Australia]] was subsequent to the separation of New Zealand from the Austro-Malayan area to the north of it. 

In the United States, scorpions are most common in southern [[Arizona]] and in a swath of land extending through central [[Texas]] and central [[Oklahoma]]. The common striped scorpion, ''[[Centruroides vittatus]]'', reaches from northwest [[Mexico]] to southern [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], southern [[Missouri]], and [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]. Species of the genus ''[[Vaejovis]]'' are found from [[Florida]] north to [[Maryland]], the Carolinas, and [[Tennessee]], and as far west as [[Oregon]] and [[California]]. ''[[Paruroctonus boreus]]'' is found through the Northwest U.S. and into [[Canada]] (Southern Saskatchewan, Southern Alberta and the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia). Scorpions can be found in 31 different states in the U.S., including [[Hawaii]] (''[[Isometrus maculatus]]'').

Five colonies of scorpions (''[[Euscorpius flavicaudis]]'') have established themselves in southern [[England]] having probably arrived with imported fruit from [[Africa]], but the number of colonies could be lower now because of the destruction of their habitats. This scorpion species is small and completely harmless to humans.

==Ultraviolet light==
[[Image:Sorpion Under Blacklight edit.jpg|thumb|250px|A scorpion under a [[Black light|blacklight]].  In normal lighting this scorpion appears black.]]

Scorpions are also known to glow when exposed to certain wavelengths of [[ultraviolet]] light such as that produced by a [[Black light|blacklight]], due to the presence of fluorescent chemicals in the cuticle. The principal fluorescent component is now known to be [[beta-Carboline]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stachel |first=Shawn J |coauthors=Scott A Stockwell and David L Van Vranken |year=1999 |month=August |title=The fluorescence of scorpions and cataractogenesis |journal=Chemistry & Biology |publisher=Cell Press |volume=6 |pages=531–539 |url=http://www.chembiol.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS1074552199800854 |accessdate=2008-06-17 |doi=10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80085-4}}</ref> A hand-held UV lamp has long been a standard tool for nocturnal field surveys of these animals.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hadley |first=Neil F. |coauthors=Stanley C.
