[[Malay titles#State Titles|Dato' Seri]] '''Anwar bin Ibrahim''' (born [[10 August]] [[1947]]) is a [[Malaysia]]n politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1993 to 1998. Early in his career, he became a protégé of the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], but subsequently emerged as the most prominent critic of Mahathir's administration. 

In 1999, he was sentenced in a highly controversial trial to six years in prison for [[Political corruption|corruption]], and in 2000, to another nine years for alleged homosexual acts. However, in 2004, Malaysia's highest court, the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]] reversed the second conviction and he was released.  In July of 2008, he was arrested over allegations he sodomised a male aide. 

Anwar is the only Malaysian to ever make it into ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Time 100|100 most influential people]] in the world.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1733748_1733757_1735709,00.html Time 100 list for 2008] May 2, 2008, ''Time Magazine'' </ref> 

On [[August 26]] [[2008]], Anwar won the [[Permatang Pauh]] by-election with a majority of 15,671, returning to Parliament as [[Opposition (Malaysia)|leader of the Malaysian opposition]].

==Early years==
Anwar was born in [[Cherok Tok Kun, Penang|Cherok Tok Kun]], a village on the mainland side of the northern Malaysian state of [[Penang]], to a hospital porter, Ibrahim Abdul Rahman (later to join politics and retire as Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Health) and Che Yan, a housewife (and later UMNO politician). He was educated at University of Malaya, where he read Malay Studies. Prior to that, he took his secondary education at the [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]].

From 1968 to 1971, as a student, Anwar was the president of a [[Muslim]] students organisation, Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia (PKPIM). He was one of the protem committee of Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM) or Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia which was founded in 1971. He was also elected President of the Malaysian Youth Council or Majlis Belia Malaysia (MBM). In 1974, Anwar was arrested during student protests against rural [[poverty]] and hunger. He was imprisoned under the [[Internal Security Act of Malaysia|Internal Security Act]], which allows for detention without trial, and spent 20 months in the [[Kamunting Detention Centre]] for political prisoners.

==Groomed for leadership==
In 1968-1971, he was first groomed in the National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students (Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia, PKPIM) as the president of the Union. He was very well known as one of the most prominent student movement leaders. In 1982, Anwar, who was the founding leader and second president of a youth Islamic organisation called [[Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM)]], shocked his liberal supporters by joining the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), led by Mahathir bin Mohamad, who became prime minister in 1981. He moved up the political ranks quickly: his first ministerial office was that of Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports in 1983; after that, he headed the agriculture ministry in 1984 before becoming Minister of Education in 1986. By then, speculation was rife about Anwar's ascent to the Deputy Prime Minister's position as it was a commonly-occurring phenomenon in Malaysia for the Education Minister to assume the position of Deputy PM in the near future. 

During his tenure as Education Minister, Anwar introduced numerous pro-Malay policies in the national school curriculum. One of the major changes that he did was to rename the national language from Bahasa Malaysia to [[Bahasa Melayu]]. Non-Malays criticized this move as it would cause the younger generation to be detached from the national language, since they would attribute it to being something that belongs to the Malays and not to Malaysians.
[[Image:Anwar Cohen 980416.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Secretary of Defense [[William S. Cohen]] (right) meets with Anwar Ibrahim (left) in his [[Pentagon]] office.]]
In 1991 Anwar was appointed Minister of Finance. In 1993, he became Mahathir's Deputy Prime Minister after winning the Deputy Presidency of UMNO against [[Ghafar Baba]]. Anwar was being groomed to succeed Mahathir as prime minister, and frequently alluded in public to his "son-father" relationship with Mahathir; in early 1997, Mahathir appointed Anwar to be acting Prime Minister while he took a two-month holiday. 

===Knighthood===
In 1994, Anwar was knighted by the then State Governor of Penang, Tun Hamdan Sheikh Tahir, a Penang-born, Negeri Sembilanese former Education Ministry Director-General who was also a family friend of his and Dr Mahathir's.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

Towards the end of the 1990s, however, the relationship with Mahathir had begun to deteriorate, triggered by their conflicting views on governance. In Mahathir's absence, Anwar had independently taken radical steps to improve the country's governing mechanisms which were in direct conflict with Mahathir's capitalist policies. Issues such as how Malaysia would respond to a financial crisis were often at the forefront of this conflict.

Anwar's frontal attack against what he described as the widespread culture of [[nepotism]] and [[cronyism]] within UMNO (and the ruling coalition as a whole) angered Mahathir, as did his attempts to dismantle the [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies that Mahathir had set up. "Cronyism" was identified by Anwar as a major cause of corruption and misappropriation of funds in the country. Mahathir retaliated by isolating Anwar within UMNO. The events of late-1998 marked the beginning of Anwar's descent within UMNO and his subsequent ouster from the party and from Malaysian politics.

== Financial crisis ==
During the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian Financial Crisis]] in 1997 Anwar, in his capacity as finance minister, supported the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) plan for recovery, which meant a restructuring of the economy involving opening up to greater foreign investment and competition.  He also instituted an [[austerity]] package that slashed government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries and deferred major investment projects. Large-scale infrastructure development projects known as "mega projects" were set back as well, despite being a cornerstone of Mahathir's plans for developing the nation. These measures aroused bitter opposition from Mahathir.  

Although many Malaysian companies faced the threat of bankruptcy, Anwar declared: "There is no question of any bailout. The banks will be allowed to protect themselves and the government will not interfere."  Anwar advocated a free market approach, sympathetic to foreign investment and trade liberalisation, whereas Mahathir favored currency and foreign investment controls, blaming unchecked speculation by currency speculators like [[George Soros]] for the shrinking economy.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} There is disagreement among economists whether Anwar's policies would have been more or less successful than Mahathir's; however, most denounced Mahathir's hypothesis that George Soros was to blame. Economists proposed currency controls before the Malaysian currency, the [[ringgit]], slid further, but their advice was not taken.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} By the time Mahathir decided to impose currency controls and preventive measures to keep hedge funds in check, the Malaysian economy had plummeted to its lowest level yet since the recession of the early-1980s. 

In 1998 ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine named Anwar the "Asian of the Year." However, in that year, matters between Anwar and Mahathir came to a head around the time of the quadrennial [[UMNO]] General Assembly. The Youth wing of UMNO, headed by Anwar's associate, [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]], gave notice that it would initiate a debate on "cronyism and nepotism".  The response was swift, as Mahathir issued lists of cronies who had benefited from government share allocations and privatisations. To the chagrin of Anwar and his allies, several of them were on the list, including Anwar and Zahid.

Anwar continued his assault on what he called the rampant corruption within Mahathir's administration, by attempting to impose transparent audits on major conglomerates and business empires, which, he alleged, had been overcharging for government projects and evading taxes. One of the potential victims would have been Mahathir's son, [[Mirzan Mahathir]], who was a director in almost 100 private and [[Government-linked company|Government-linked companies]]. Conglomerates that were closely linked to the government, such as Renong, would have been adversely affected as well.

== Allegations == 
At the UMNO General Assembly, a book, ''50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM'' ("50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister") was circulated containing graphic allegations as well as accusations of corruption against Anwar.  This book carried the byline Khalid Jafri, an ex-editor of the government-controlled newspaper ''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'' and former editor-in-chief of a failed magazine, ''Harian National''. Anwar obtained a court injunction to prevent further distribution of the book and filed a defamation action against the author. In August, police charged the author of the book with malicious publishing of false news. In September, the judge who had banned the book's distribution was transferred to a lower court despite being a senior judge.

Among the allegations in the book was that Anwar is homosexual and a serial [[sodomite]]. The  police were instructed to investigate the veracity of the claims. The author died in 2005 of complications from [[diabetes]], but not before the High Court found that he had committed [[libel]] and awarded Anwar millions of ringgit in compensation.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Recently, the former deputy President of Anwar's political party, Dr. Chandra Muzaffar, lambasted Anwar for his close ties to [[Paul Wolfowitz]], the former [[U.S. Secretary of Defense|U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense]] and former president of the [[World Bank]]. In an interview with the [[BBC]]'s ''Hardtalk'' after his release from prison, Anwar admitted to his friendship with Wolfowitz. This allegation has repercussions in Malays, who have been found to generally agree with the statement by former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, that the U.S.-led "[[war on terror]]" is actually a "war on Islam".<ref>[http://sify.com/news/international/fullstory.php?id=13285283 Muslims can win, Mahathir tells OIC] Oct 16, 2003, ''Sify News''</ref>

==Trial and conviction==
Anwar was fired from the Cabinet in September, amid police reports that he was under investigation.  The following day, he was expelled from UMNO. Dr. Munawar Anees, Anwar's former speechwriter, and Sukma Darmawan Sasmita Atmadja, Anwar's adoptive brother, were arrested under suspicion of engaging in homosexual acts. Five days later, they were given a jail sentence of six months after pleading guilty to "unnatural sex" with Anwar.  They later recanted their confessions, and appealed the sentence, claiming to have been [[coercion|coerced]] into pleading guilty. Anees made a statutory declaration to that effect.<ref>[http://www.c2o.org/malaysia/democracy/reports/981203_stat_dec_munawar_01.htm Statutory Declaration from Dr. Munawar Ahmad Anees (part 1)] Dec 3, 1998</ref> Two of Anwar's secretaries, Ezam Mohamad and Mohamad Azmin Ali, were both held separately as part of police investigations into the "50 reasons" book. Both were later released.

A few days later Anwar addressed a protest gathering of nearly 100,000 people in [[Kuala Lumpur]], after which a number of his supporters marched to Mahathir's then official residence demanding ''reformasi'' (economic and political reforms) and Mahathir's resignation. This march, a rare event in Malaysia, caused concern in the government. That night, Anwar's home was raided by a masked and armed [[SWAT]] team from the Royal Malaysian Police. His arrest was announced several hours later, as were those of several of Anwar's supporters, although most of them were later released.

== Charges of corruption and sodomy ==
[[Image:Anwar Ibrahim and police 20020207.jpg|thumb|right|Anwar Ibrahim being escorted by the police to the [[Federal Court of Malaysia]] on [[February 4]], [[2002]], he was released from prison on [[September 2]], [[2004]] after his conviction on sodomy was reversed.]]
On [[September 29]], [[1998]] Anwar appeared in court and pleaded innocent to charges of corruption and [[sodomy]]. A photo of Anwar with a black eye (which he incurred from a beating by then [[Inspector General of Police]] Rahim Noor) and one hand raised became a symbol of the political opposition in many ''reformasi'' posters. 

The black eye was explained by Mahathir Mohamad and Rahim Noor as being "self-inflicted" and caused by "pressing a glass over his eyes". Only after a Royal Commission was convened did Rahim Noor admit that he had administered the beating to Anwar <ref name="Aliran Black Eye">{{cite press release |title=Rahim Noor's Confession: Black Eye and Blacker Deeds |publisher=Aliran |date=1999-03-01 |url=http://www.aliran.com/oldsite/ms990301.html |format=HTML |language=English |accessdate=2008-08-30 |quote= }}</ref> <ref name="DAP Black Eye">{{cite press release |title=Anwar vindicated but Attorney-General should give full accounting of the compensation government is paying for Rahim Noor’s “black-eye” assault |publisher=Democratic Action Party |date=2005-08-04 |url=http://www.dapmalaysia.org/all-archive/English/2005/Aug05/lks/lks3607.htm |format=HTML |language=English |accessdate=2008-08-30 |quote= }}</ref> Rahim apologized for the incident in August 2005 <ref name="BBC Black Eye">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Anwar wins apology for beating |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/asia-pacific/4740937.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2005-08-03 |accessdate=2008-09-07 }}</ref>. Both Anwar and Rahim Noor have denied the allegations that Anwar was sodomised in prison to "plant" the [[forensic evidence]] of [[anal sex]].

During the trial, a mattress was presented to court, supposedly stained with Anwar's semen. This was submitted as [[DNA evidence]] of Anwar's sexual acts. Anwar denied having anything to do with the mattress, although the DNA tests came out positive. The defense team alleged that Anwar was [[masturbation|masturbated]] while unconscious. Dr. Lim Kong Boon, a doctor during the trial <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/244570.stm Anwar trial hears DNA evidence] Dec 30, 1998, ''BBC News''</ref>, testified that it is possible to massage the [[prostate gland]] through the [[anus]] in order to stimulate [[orgasm|ejaculation]] in an unconscious victim. The defense council presented this as evidence for police [[sexual abuse]] to obtain false forensics evidence to frame Anwar.

Anwar was also accused of corruption relating to the police investigation into and arrest of the author of ''50 Reasons''. He was also accused of sodomy with his wife's chauffeur, Azizan Abu Bakar. Judge Augustine Paul wrote 320 page judgment in the case, the longest judgment in the country's history. <ref>Public Prosecutor v Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim[1998] 4 MLJ 481;Public Prosecutor v Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim (No 2) 1999] 2 MLJ 249; Public Prosecutor v Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim (No 3)[1999] 2 MLJ 1; and Public Prosecutor v Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim (No 4)[1999] 5 MLJ 545</ref> In that judgment, he explains the [[evidence]] involved and the rulings he made. 

During the trial, Mahathir appeared on Malaysian television in a special appearance to explain the arrest of his deputy. This was one of several occasions in which Mahathir declared Anwar guilty of sodomy and homosexual acts, even as the trial still was underway. The government included the statements of the purported victims of Anwar's sodomy attacks, evidence that was widely considered to be tainted.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Furthermore, the prosecution was unable to accurately decide on a date that the alleged acts of anal sex had occurred - the government originally alleged that a sodomy had occurred inside a building that had not been constructed at the time of the alleged event. Furthermore, the Attorney General's prosecution team (headed by Abdul Gani Patail) also submitted a scenario in which Dr Munawar Anees took an overnight flight from Britain all the way to Malaysia to be sodomized by Anwar, and flew back to Britain after that. The infamous "stained mattress" that was taken in and out of court over 20 times throughout the duration of the trial, was supposedly the same one that Anwar did his homosexual acts and extramarital sex on. However, according to the evidence, the sexual acts had taken place on the mattress a few years ago, and yet the DNA evidence obtained from it were rather recent in age.

On [[April 14]], [[1999]], Anwar was sentenced to six years in prison for corruption and, on [[August 8]], [[2000]], nine years in prison  for sodomy.  The sentences were to be served consecutively, and Anwar was given no credit for the six months he spent in jail during the trial. The following year, Anwar's corruption conviction was upheld by Malaysia's Court of Appeal. In July 2002, Anwar lost his final appeal against the corruption conviction in the Federal Court.

In a speech during the proceedings against him, Anwar explained what he believed to be the underlying motive behind his persecution. He told the court: "I objected to the use of massive public funds to rescue the failed businesses of his (Mahathir's) children and cronies." Both [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] expressed doubts about the fairness of the trials. <ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA280152003?open&of=ENG-MYS Malaysia: Double injustice heaped on Anwar Ibrahim] Apr 18, 2003, ''Amnesty International''</ref> <ref>[http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jun/anwar0610.htm Human Rights Watch Monitors Second Anwar Trial] June 11, 1999, ''Human Rights Watch''</ref> [[Amnesty International]] subsequently designated Anwar as a [[prisoner of conscience]]. The trial also provoked international criticism. Then-[[U.S. Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] denounced Anwar's trial as a "mockery", but Mahathir rejected all such international criticism as "foreign interference."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/873592.stm Gore: Anwar trial a 'mockery Gore: Anwar trial a 'mockery'] Aug 9, 2000, ''BBC News''</ref>

Anwar's wife, [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail|Wan Azizah Ismail]], subsequently formed Parti Keadilan Nasional (the National Justice Party, later known as [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] or the People's Justice Party), which based its platform on campaigning for Anwar's release and ''reformasi''. At the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|following general election]], the People's Justice Party performed poorly in the election, only retaining a single parliamentary seat, Anwar's old parliamentary seat of Permatang Pauh, which was won by his wife.

==Release from prison==
On [[September 2]], [[2004]], a panel of three judges of the Federal Court (Malaysia's highest court) overturned the sodomy conviction by 2 to 1, finding contradictions in the prosecution's case. However, the judges noted "We find evidence to confirm that the appellants were involved in homosexual activities and we are more inclined to believe that the alleged incident at Tivoli Villa did happen."

Anwar completed his term for corruption after his sentence was being reduced for good behaviour. Although the point was by now moot, an appeal on the corruption charges was heard on [[September 6]], [[2004]]. Under Malaysian law a person is banned from political activities for five years after the end of his sentence. Success in this appeal would have allowed him to return to politics immediately. On September 7, the court agreed to hear Anwar's appeal. However, on September 15, the of Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that its previous decision to uphold a High Court ruling that found Anwar guilty was in order, relegating Anwar to the sidelines of Malaysian politics until [[April 14]], [[2008]]. The only way for Anwar to be freed from this stricture would have been for him to receive a pardon from the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]].

At the time of his release from prison, Anwar was reportedly suffering from serious back problems, which his family said was the result of the beating by the ex-police chief. However, the UMNO-owned [[newspaper]], the ''[[New Straits Times]]'', alleged that the injuries had actually been caused by a fall from a horse in 1993 during Anwar's tenure as deputy prime minister.  His wife had argued during his imprisonment that he required treatment for his condition at a clinic in [[Germany]].  The government refused, claiming that such treatment was readily available in Malaysia, offering medical treatment if necessary.  However, in September 2004, after the Federal Court quashed his conviction for sodomy, Anwar was free to travel to [[Munich]] for back surgery. 

Since his release from prison, Anwar has held teaching positions at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]], where he was a visiting fellow and senior associate member, at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies|School of Advance International Studies]] in [[Washington DC]] as a Distinguished Senior Visiting Fellow, and as a visiting professor in the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]]. In March 2006 he was appointed as Honorary President of the [[London]]-based organization [[AccountAbility (Institute of Social and Ethical AccountAbility)]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accountability.org.uk/ |title=AccountAbility |accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

In July 2006, Anwar was elected Chair of the Washington-based [[Foundation for the Future]] <ref>[http://www.foundationforfuture.org/press_releases/july15.html Foundation for the Future Holds its First Board Meeting in Doha, Qatar], July 15, 2006</ref>. In this capacity, he signed the [[October 1]], [[2006]] letter to [[Robin Cleveland]] of the [[World Bank]], requesting the transfer of the secondment of [[Shaha Riza]] from the [[US Department of State]] to the Foundation for the Future. This transaction led to Paul Wolfowitz's resignation as president of the organization.<ref>[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21297772~menuPK:34463~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html Ethics Committee Case No2 and President's Paper, p.102], Jun 2, 2005, ''World Bank''</ref> He was one of the signatories of [[A Common Word Between Us and You]] in 2007, an open letter by Islamic scholars to Christian leaders, calling for peace and understanding.

==Political future==
In November 2006, Anwar announced he planned to run for Parliament in 2008, after his disqualification expired. Anwar has been critical of government policies since his release from prison, most notably of the controversial [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which provides [[affirmative action]] for the Malays. The policy sets a number of quotas, such as for units of housing and [[initial public offering]]s, that must be met.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aAjtL0wmitME&refer=home Malaysia's Anwar Says He Plans to Run for Parliament] Nov 30, 2006, ''Bloomberg''.</ref> 

[[Image:Anwar Ibrahim2.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim announcing his intention to contest in a by-election to enter parliament.]]

He is also the Advisor of [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]], the party of which his wife Dr. Wan Azizah is president. He was in the forefront in organising a November 2007 mass rally, called the [[2007 Bersih Rally]], which took place in the [[Dataran Merdeka]] Kuala Lumpur to demand clean and fair elections. The gathering was organised by BERSIH, a coalition comprising political parties and civil society groups, and drew supporters from all over the country.

The [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 election]] date, however, was set for [[8 March]] [[2008]], sparking criticisms that Barisan Nasional called for early elections in a bid to deny Anwar's plans for a return to Parliament. In response, Anwar's wife, [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]], declared that she would step down should she retain her Permatang Pauh parliamentary seat to force a [[by-election]] in which Anwar himself would contest.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/specialreport/view/1457/1/.html Wan Azizah declares she is Anwar proxy] Feb 25, 2008, ''Channel NewsAsia''</ref>

When asked about the possibility of Anwar becoming the next Prime Minister, former leader Tun Dr. Mahathir reacted by saying rather sarcastically, "He would make a good Prime Minister of Israel".<ref>[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/mni/when-mahathir-lashes-at-anwar-who-is-he-really-after.html "When Mahathir lashes out at Anwar, will it catch fire?"] March 31, 2008, ''The Malaysian Insider. ''</ref>

On [[April 14]], [[2008]], Anwar celebrated his official return to the political stage, as his ban from public office expired a decade after he was fired as Deputy Prime Minister.  One of the main reasons the opposition seized a third of parliamentary seats and five states in the worst ever showing for the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for half a century, was due to him leading at the helm.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hFSMeru-BqR2BIAOAQY_ul-3Klhg "Malaysian opposition leader Anwar marks end of political ban"], AFP, April 14, 2008.</ref> A gathering of more than 1,000 supporters greeted Anwar in a rally welcoming his return to politics.

On [[April 29]], [[2008]], after 10 years of absence, he returned to the Parliament, albeit upon invitation as a spouse guest of Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, People's Justice Party and the first female opposition leader in Malaysian Parliament's history.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hVCWRBldBYxuA8tEDUuzhW0xqUyQD90BEGP00 Malaysia's Anwar returns to Parliament], Associated Press, April 29, 2008.</ref>  Anwar Ibrahim stated he is confident that he can win over enough government legislators in a parliamentary vote in September to end over 50 years of rule by one party.  His party pledged to stage a confidence vote on [[September 16]] against Abdullah Badawi and needed the support of just 30 government legislators in the 222-seat lower house of parliament, but missed Anwar's own deadline. Prior to this they had hoped to sway ruling party lawmakers from the states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to oust the UMNO party from power for the first time since Malaysia won independence in 1957.<ref>[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=233838&version=1&template_id=45&parent_id=25 "Anwar confident of winning over enough legislators in September vote"], Gulf Times, August 5, 2008.</ref>

On [[July 27]] [[2008]], Anwar Ibrahim said that he aimed to return to Parliament if a court ordered a by-election near his home town of Permatang Pauh in Penang.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080727/wl_asia_afp/malaysiapoliticsoppositionanwar_080727050217 Malaysia's Anwar eyes return to parliament in by-election] July 27, 2008, ''Associated Press''</ref>  He said on [[July 31]] that he would contest a by-election for the parliamentary seat of Permatang Pauh, which was being vacated by his wife in order to expedite his return to political office.

Anwar said: "Barisan Nasional is clearly overwhelmed. It's no longer a by-election. It's more than that".

On [[August 28]], 2008, Anwar, dressed in a dark blue traditional Malay outfit and black "songkok" hat, took the oath at the main chamber of Parliament house in [[Kuala Lumpur]], as MP for [[Permatang Pauh]] at 10.03 a.m. before Speaker Tan Sri Pandikar Amin Mulia. He formally declared Anwar the leader of the 3-party opposition alliance. With his daughter [[Nurul Izzah Anwar]], also a parliamentarian, Anwar announced: "I'm glad to be back after a decade.

==Member of Parliament==

On [[August 28]], 2008 just after being sworn in as an MP, Anwar Ibrahim staged a dramatic walkout with 81 opposition lawmakers hours later in a row over controversial DNA sampling legislation. Anwar has alleged that the legislation which would force suspected criminals to give DNA samples was targeted at him, as he previosuly refused to provide a DNA sample after again being arrested on sodomy charges.<ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia's Anwar stages walkout after return to parliament |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKKKrOEQ1VYQKjcemfrVu-4FGnWw|work=AFP|publisher=Google News|date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

On [[September 2]], 2008, Anwar said he would dismantle controversial positive-discrimination policies for Muslim Malays if he seizes power in the multicultural country.  New Economic Policy (NEP) launched in the early 1970s would be replaced by a system to boost all poor Malaysians, whether they are majority Malays or from the minority Chinese and Indian communities.  "We will do everything in our power and disposal to help and assist the poor and the marginalised, which means the vast majority of the Malays and the poor Chinese and the poor Indians, but we do it on a needs basis," he said.  He also promised to abandon the Approved Permits (AP) scheme for importing cars, which it is claimed has corruptly enriched a small number of Malay entrepreneurs. <ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia's Anwar promises to dump pro-Malay policies |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080902/wl_asia_afp/malaysiaislameconomyopposition_080902100817|work=AFP|publisher=Yahoo!

Among measures he outlined were ways to stimulate local and foreign investment, reduce the 4.8% deficit of the gross domestic product, reduce fuel prices and give tax rebates as a business incentive. Others measures include curbing public expenditure on mega projects and reforming the system of awarding Approved Permits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Anwar plans a 'better budget'|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/2/nation/20080902165528&sec=nation|work=Florence A.Samy |publisher=TheStar| date=2008-09-02|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=M'sia's Anwar slams budget, wants to present a new one | url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?id=1245&sec=1|work=The Straits Times |publisher=Asia News Network| date=2008-09-03|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref>

Anwar Ibrahim said on [[September 10]], 2008 that he will topple Malaysia's government by early next week despite a trip abroad by ruling coalition lawmakers that he claims is aimed at thwarting his plans.  About 50 [[Barisan Nasional]] lawmakers left for a farming study tour in Taiwan earlier this week amid opposition accusations that coalition leaders had sent them there to keep them away from Anwar and to dissuade some of them from defecting.  He claimed to have made tacit pacts with dozens of lawmakers in recent months, and insisted that he was still "very much" on track for his target date of toppling the government.<ref>{{cite news |title=Anwar says Malaysia government to fall by Tuesday | url=http://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/ap/20080910/tap-as-malaysia-anwar-2nd-ld-writethru-b3c65ae.html|work=Associated Press|publisher=Yahoo!

[[Image:Anwar KelanaJaya.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Anwar Ibrahim speaks during a rally at Kelana Jaya stadium, Petaling Jaya calling for the Prime Minister to hand over power 'smoothly and peacefully'.]]
On [[September 14]], 2008 Anwar announced that a mass rally would be held against a government crackdown which he says is aimed at preventing him from seizing power within the next few days. The government takeover which is slated for next Tuesday could be delayed by the series of arrests under tough internal security laws.  The arrests on Friday of an opposition politician Teresa Kok, a prominent blogger Raja Petra Kamararuddin and a journalist raised fears of a widespread campaign against dissent. The opposition alliance said it expected some 30,000 supporters to gather for the rally at Kelana Jaya stadium<ref>{{cite news | title=Malaysia's Anwar plans mass rally over govt crackdown | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080914/wl_asia_afp/malaysiapoliticsopposition_080914061828|work=AFP|publisher=Yahoo!

Anwar refused to give an exact number or to name the lawmakers, saying they will be subject to harassment by the government or even detention.  Four demands had been issued to the PM in a letter sent Monday [[15 September]]. The demands are that MPs are not stopped from defecting; the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] not be used to detain defecting or PR MPs; a state of emergency should not be declared; and no roadblocks be set up to stop MPs from going to Parliament.<ref>{{cite news | title=Anwar Wants Smooth Transition Of Power | url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/16305 |work=MySinChew.com|publisher=SinChew| date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>He said the opposition alliance is now seeking a meeting with Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to stake claim to the government and to give him the opportunity to exit gracefully.

===Failure to Meet Deadlines===

Anwar has already missed several deadlines he himself set for the transfer of power, each of which came and went: the most recent was Tuesday [[16 September]] 2008.<ref>{{cite news | title=Anwar fails to form next Government | url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Tuesday/Frontpage/20080916150130/Article/index_html |work=nst.com.my|publisher=New Strait Times| date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> Anwar said he would need more time, and the recalibration of his message has not gone unnoticed: Deputy Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] chose that day to initiate a broadband internet program Anwar opposes, saying that he had not doubted that the government would still be in office on [[16 September]]<ref>{{cite news | title=No change in govt, says Najib | url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/16/nation/20080916134131&sec=nation |work=http://thestar.com.my|publisher=The Star| date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>. Prime Minister [[Abdullah Badawi]] too pointed out that Anwar had missed his own deadline, and dismissed his claim to have secured the defection of 30 MPs.<ref>{{cite news | title=Malaysian PM calls opposition bluff  | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2008/09/200891643451339289.html| publisher=Al Jazeera English| date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

On [[17 September]] 2008, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that Anwar's recent actions have affected political and economic stability.  He stated that Anwar had spread lies about the economic situation in the country including that no foreign direct investment was coming in and that the nation was no longer competitive.<ref>{{cite news|title=Anwar Now A Threat To Economy And National Security, Says Abdullah| url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=359705| publisher=Bernama| date=2008-09-17|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref>

On [[18 September]] 2008 Anwar demanded an emergency [[Dewan Rakyat| Parliament]] session for a no confidence vote in the government, insisting he has secured enough defections from the ruling coalition to topple it.  He said he had sent a letter to Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, asking that the special session be held no later than Tuesday [[September 23]], 2008. Currently  the Parliament is in recess until mid-October.  "Any delay in his response would be interpreted as nothing short of sabotage of democratic process and abuse of executive powers," he told reporters. "It is therefore critical for the prime minister to respond."  He says he can't reveal the names of MPs who have defected until they demonstrate their loyalty in Parliament and to protect them from possible detention or other extra-judicial efforts by the government to prevent them from crossing over.<ref>{{cite news | title=Anwar demands special Malaysia Parliament session  | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080918/ap_on_re_as/as_malaysia_politics |work=Associated Press|publisher=Yahoo!

== New allegations of sodomy ==
On [[June 29]], [[2008]], online news portal [[Malaysiakini]] reported that an aide of Anwar Ibrahim had lodged a police report claiming that he had been sodomised by Anwar. The news has since been updated with reports that [[SMS]] messages are being distributed claiming that the person who made the report is Anwar's aide, Mohd Saiful Bukhari Azlan, who was arrested and allegedly forced to make a false confession. The same text message also claimed the possibility of Anwar being arrested.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Aide alleges sodomy: Report lodged |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/85246 |work=Malaysiakini |publisher=Mkini Dotcom Sdn Bhd |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2008-06-28 }}</ref>  

Wan Azizah Wan Ismail accused the government of orchestrating the allegations, which she condemned as "political murder" against her husband. She produced a photograph of the aide with a staff member of Deputy Prime Minister and said it proved a link of a government [[conspiracy]]. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi denied it and stressed that his government was not behind the latest sodomy allegation against Parti Keadilan Rakyat de facto leader Anwar. On the allegation by Anwar's wife where she had shown the photograph taken with a staff member of Deputy Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, Najib Razak explained that the picture was taken three months ago when Mohd Saiful went to his office to apply a for government scholarship.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp? file=/2008/6/30/nation/20080630150522&sec=nation]</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia's Anwar seeks refuge at embassy after sex allegations|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g_B4pMW41F4kA4P9bBQ4Lv3xFpBA |work=AFP|publisher=AFP |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2008-06-29 }}</ref>

On [[June 30]], Anwar moved into the compound of the Turkish Embassy in Kuala Lumpur at the invitation of Turkish ambassador Barlas Özener, who denied it and told Foreign Minister of Malaysia Dato' Seri Dr. [[Rais Yatim]] that Anwar had come on “his own accord for a visit”. Rais added Malaysia was concerned that getting protection or shelter from foreign missions would become a trend for those who violated the country’s law.
Anwar Ibrahim said that he would leave by 11 a.m. British time, and he never sought [[political asylum]], but sought refuge there on "[[humanitarian]] grounds": "If the government gives me a categorical undertaking for my personal safety I will leave (the embassy) now."<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKKLR14724220080630  uk.reuters.com, Malaysia's Anwar says to leave embassy soon]</ref> To clear his name, Ibrahim filed a lawsuit against his 23-year old male aide who accused him of sodomy, in the [[Kuala Lumpur]] High Court.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/104069/Anwar-files-suit-to-clear-name-of-sodomy-raps gmanews.tv, Anwar files suit to clear name of sodomy raps]</ref> Anwar left the embassy after a meeting between Malaysia's Foreign Minister, Rais Yatim, and Turkish ambassador Barlas Ozener.

Anwar on [[July 1]], [[2008]] vowed before 7,000 people at [[Shah Alam]] rally in Melawati Stadium to seize power soon, mobilizing his campaign against the government amid the sodomy charge. His road shows will begin with [[Padang Timur]], [[Petaling Jaya]] as its first stop. Abdullah Ahmad Badawi is also under pressure from some of his own party members in Barisan Nasional to step down.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvk18e1IzUJ9V-VNzo1_wg-4mkWgD91LJ80G0  ap.google.com, Malaysia's Anwar vows to seize power]</ref> Meanwhile, Deputy Inspector-General of Police Ismail Omar on [[July 2]] classified the crime charged as [[sodomy]], based on a [[Kuala Lumpur]] Hospital medical report of [[anal sex]] upon the alleged victim, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, 23, an aide. He was a student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [[Universiti Tenaga Nasional]]. The incident allegedly took place at Desa Damansara condominiums, [[Damansara]] Heights. Sodomy, even if consensual, is punishable by up to 20 years [[imprisonment]] and [[whipping]] under Section 377B of the Malaysian Penal Code.<ref>[http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/S-E%2BAsia/STIStory_253862.html straitstimes.com, M'sian police classify sexual assault report against Anwar as sodomy]</ref><ref>[http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Asia/STIStory_253864.html www.straitstimes.com, Anwar accuser a 'genuine guy', say varsity friends]</ref><ref>[http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Wednesday/Frontpage/20080702162851/Article/index_html  nst.com.my, Anwar to embark on nationwide roadshow to defend himself against sodomy allegations]</ref>

Criminal Investigation Department director Bakri Zinin on July 7 stated that Anwar's accuser, Saiful Bahri, who had not been seen in public since July 2, would remain under police protection until termination of investigations.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=124370  abs-cbnnews.com,  Anwar's accuser under Malaysian police protection]</ref>  On [[July 9]], [[2008]], Anwar asked an Islamic court to investigate his former aide.

The witnesses must be credible and male.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7498368.stm  BBC News, Anwar challenges sodomy accuser ]</ref> There was also a unreported police raid at [[One World Hotel]] in [[Selangor]], where the police demanded that the hotel release [[CCTV]] footage of a connected incident. Details of the raid have yet to be confirmed.

On [[August 15]], 2008 Mohd Saiful Bukhari Azlan swore on the Quran that he was sodomised by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim according to Federal Territory Mosque Imam Ramlang Porigi.  Ramlang said that he was one of four imams present for the ceremony that was held between 6.15pm and 6.20pm. <ref>[http://www.theedgedaily.com/cms/content.jsp?id=com.tms.cms.article.Article_f7f68bdd-cb73c03a-df294000-affbca6e TheEdgeDaily, ‘Sumpah’ by Saiful meant for adultery cases, says imam]</ref> Ramlang Porigi said that Mohd Saiful Bukhari Azlan’s Quranic oath or “sumpah muhabalah” was technically wrong.  “I was only there as a witness, to listen in,” he elaborated, noting that Saiful made two errors while reciting the oath: the first when he mispronounced the word for God and had Ramlang correct him; and the second when he confused the date of the alleged sodomy incident and corrected himself.  It was supposed to have happened on June 26, but Saiful slipped and said Aug 26 instead.  Ramlang described that Saiful looked far from regretful or fearful, for someone who had just uttered dreadful words that essentially asked God to rain down his just vengeance on him and his descendants if he lied.  Ramlang reiterated that he had only been given the role of witness to play that day because he had been ordered to do so by his superiors. However, he declined to name them. As a simple government servant, he had only followed orders.<ref>[http://themalaysianinsider.com.my/index.php/malaysia/8113-anwar-campaign-undermines-saifuls-quran-oath Malaysia Insider, Anwar campaign undermines Saiful’s Quran oath ]</ref>

On [[September 10]], 2008 Anwar Ibrahim's legal defence team fought to prevent the politically-charged case from being moved to the High Court.  His supporters fear authorities might be able to manipulate the case more easily at the High Court, and that seeking a transfer is little more than a delaying tactic. In a win for the defence, the Sessions Court judge made the unusual decision of setting a [[September 24]] hearing for the Anwar's defence team to present its case against transfer to the High Court.<ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia's Anwar fights bid to move sodomy case to High Court  |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080910/wl_asia_afp/malaysiapoliticsopposition_080910060327 |work=AFP|publisher=Yahoo!

===Arrest, detention and release on bail===

Malaysian police issued an [[arrest warrant]] on July 15 to Anwar Ibrahim, who was formally a suspect in the sodomy crime, a non-[[bail]]able offence. Investigating officer Jude Pereira signed and issued the letter requiring Anwar to appear at a police station for questioning before Wednesday at 2 p.m. (0600 GMT). He can be held in custody for up to 14 days, after which he must be charged.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvk18e1IzUJ9V-VNzo1_wg-4mkWgD91U79O81 ap.google.com, Malaysia arrest warrant issued for Anwar]</ref> Counsel Nair said Anwar agreed to the new request for questioning, amid arrest under the Sodomy Act. Home Minister [[Syed Hamid Albar]] demanded that Anwar provide his [[DNA]]: "We have taken DNA (from the accuser) so we have to take Anwar's DNA also."<ref>[http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-34521520080715?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0 in.reuters.com, Malaysia police may arrest Anwar, govt asks for DNA]</ref>
 
On [[July 16]], [[2008]] Anwar was arrested by a contingent of 10 police cars (half unmarked and half-patrol) with 20 [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]]-clad masked [[commandos]], under Section 377A of the Penal Code, outside his home on July 16, one hour before he was due to make a statement at the police HQ. Earlier, he cut short the interview at the Anti-Corruption Agency HQ to meet the deadline but the police still arrested him. Meanwhile, Malaysian authorities braced for mass protests.<ref>[http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Wednesday/Frontpage/20080716182829/Article/index_html  nst.com.my, POLICE CHIEF: Anwar’s arrest followed legal process]</ref><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4342945.ece timesonline.co.uk, Malaysia braced for riots after sodomy arrest of Anwar Ibrahim, opposition leader]</ref>

According to his lawyer Sankara Nair, Anwar had agreed to meet police later during the day on a sodomy complaint lodged by a former aide, and police had warned they would arrest him if he did not show up. The police did not specify what the opposition leader was being charged with, but that he would be taken to the Kuala Lumpur police headquarters.  <ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysian opposition leader Anwar arrested: lawyer  | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080716/wl_afp/malaysiapoliticsanwararrest_080716053946 |work=AFP | publisher=Yahoo News|date=2008-07-17|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> According to his party Anwar has been taken to hospital by the police after his arrest on sodomy allegations, and is believed to be undergoing a medical examination.

Anwar was released without charges filed, by police [[bail]] on [[July 17]], after overnight detention, and after recorded statement. Back home in Bukit Segambut, [[Kuala Lumpur]] (10.05 a.m.), his lawyers, R. Sivarasa and Sankara Nair, said Anwar must report to the Kuala Lumpur police headquarters on August 18.<ref>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/17/nation/20080717094352&sec=nation thestar.com.my, Anwar released on police bail]</ref><ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Rest_of_World/Malaysian_opposition_leader_Anwar_Ibrahim_released_on_bail/articleshow/3243137.cms  indiatimes.com, Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim released on bail]</ref> 

Anwar complained he was locked-up with hardcore criminals overnight and forced to sleep on the cement floor: "It is known that I have a severe back problem and I had a major back surgery before. Lying on the cold cement floor has exacerbated the pain. It was only at 1am when Azizah (wife, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail) brought me a towel that I could put the towel on the floor and lie on it.I don’t deserve this. No Malaysian deserves this. Why treat me like a major criminal and public enemy? Short of torture, what else do you call it?" His family doctor had to inject him with a strong dosage of [[painkiller]]. R. Sivarasa said the police bail for Anwar's release was RM 10,000.<ref>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/18/nation/21856367&sec=nation thestar.com.my, Show us the report, says Anwar]</ref><ref>[http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20080719-77648.html news.asiaone.com,  Anwar's conditions for DNA testing]</ref>

[[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia]], on [[July 20]] proposed that international experts be used in the investigation against Anwar, for [[Koh Tsu Koon]] opined this would prevent falsification of [[DNA]] samples. Deputy Police chief Ismail Omar said that the police will not use the 1998 DNA sample collected from Anwar. [[Kuala Lumpur]] Hospital Director Zaininah Mohammed Zain said Anwar was not stripped naked in his medical examination.<ref>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/20/nation/21873504&sec=nation thestar.com.my, Foreign experts in Anwar case required, says Gerakan]</ref> Kuala Lumpur Hospital Director Zaininah Mohammed Zain said Anwar was not stripped [[naked]] in his medical examination. Anwar however spoke of his “embarrassment at being ordered to strip naked and ‘measured’ when he was taken to the hospital”. He said: “I was stripped naked and had my private parts examined. They also measured the parts.” The [[circumcision scar]] was also measured and observed. His lawyer R. Sivarasa said that a court order to give his DNA sample was not allowed under Malaysian law.<ref>[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=347228 bernama.com.my, bernama.com.my/bernama, MP suggests use of independent prosecutors]</ref><ref>[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world-news/malaysian-pm-bars-top-officials-from-probing-ibrahim_10073683.html  thaindian.com, Malaysian PM bars top officials from probing Ibrahim]</ref>

Anwar has said that he has an alibi for "every minute" of the day when he is accused of sodomy with a former male aide.   He mentioned the allegation is a set-up - a repeat of similar claims 10 years ago for which he was sacked from his post as deputy prime minister, tried and jailed. <ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysian Anwar in 'sodomy alibi' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7513963.stm |work=BBC | publisher=BBC News|date=2008-07-18|accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref>

Anwar Ibrahim, on [[August 7]], 2008, pleaded not guilty to "unnatural sex" [[sodomy]] charge (defined as "carnal intercourse against the order of nature") at the [[Jalan Duta]] Court complex and released by Sessions Court Judge Komathy Suppiah on a personal [[bail]] bond of 20,000 ringgit (USD6,090). Suppiah ruled: "A man is innocent until proven guilty. I don't think there's any likelihood that Dato Seri Anwar Ibrahim will abscond." The trial was set for [[September 10]]. Anwar called the accusation, a government conspiracy, and undermined his plans to run for the [[August 26]] parliamentary by-election set by the Malaysia's Election Commission:``It is a slander, and malicious, and I am not guilty,'reformasi'."<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a78n21e1WuV8&refer=home bloomberg.com, Malaysia's Anwar Pleads Not Guilty to Sex Charge]</ref>  <ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia's Anwar charged with sodomy |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/07/malaysia.anwar/index.html?section=cnn_latest |work=CNN|publisher=CNN |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2008-08-07 }}</ref>  <ref>{{cite news |title=Anwar: Innocent of Sodomy Charge |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1830137,00.html?xid=rss-topstories |work=Time|publisher=Time.com |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2008-08-07 }}</ref>

===International reaction===

Meanwhile former [[Philippine]] president [[Joseph Estrada]] expressed sympathies over Ibrahim's  arrest. Estrada, through spokesman Margaux Salcedo, said: "Like Anwar, former President Estrada was put in prison for charges that were unjustified and untrue in order to execute a power grab in 2001. It appears that today's arrest of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was politically motivated. This appears to be a repeat of what they did in 1998 when they jailed Anwar for sodomy at the height of the protests against then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and released him six years later because he was not guilty."<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=125451  abs-cbnnews.com, Erap feels for friend Anwar]</ref>

The [[United States]] said that the arrest has raised serious concerns.  The State Department has urged Malaysian authorities to resolve this matter in a manner that builds confidence in the impartial rule of law in Malaysia.  Two US rights groups, the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute also expressed concerns about the arrest and hoped the investigation into the sodomy claims was not used as a political tool to silence him.  They have questioned the timing of the current allegations amid Anwar's re-emergence on the national political scene since a ban on his involvement in politics expired in April 2008.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/360866/1/.html  Channelnewsasia, US voices "serious concerns" over Anwar's arrest]</ref>  US [[Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] reiterated the U.S. view that transparency and rule of law must be followed in Anwar's case.  She said the United States had long spoken out in cases deemed to be political in nature and would continue to do so. <ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN2347329220080724  Channelnewsasia, Rice says will continue to speak out on Anwar]</ref>

Human Rights Watch's Asia director Brad Adams, on [[August 7]], stated: "The Malaysian government appears to be manipulating the legal system to shore up support for its continued rule and undermine the opposition. This case is really about preventing challenges to the government's rule. Previous trials for sodomy and corruption, which landed him in jail for six years until 2004, raised serious concerns about judicial independence and fairness." Amnesty International also "expressed grave concern over the charges and said they appeared to be an attempt to prevent the 60-year-old opposition leader from re-entering parliament." Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, howevers assured that: "There's no conspiracy," he said, according to the New Straits Times daily. "How could I insist that he be charged? The police are not so stupid to simply charge if there is no evidence."<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iEg6QO7zxNvZtTZnZAWchWpt6q_w afp.google.com,Malaysian opposition leader Anwar charged with sodomy]</ref>

Former United States vice-president [[Al Gore]] accused the Malaysia government of engaging in character assassination of Anwar Ibrahim to silence an effective leader of the political opposition. <ref>[http://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/bnm/20080807/tts-rais-information-bm-993ba14.html, FOREIGN MINISTRY TO HOLD INFORMATION SESSIONS ABROAD]</ref> Justice [[Sandra Day O’Connor]], a former justice of the [[US Supreme Court]] and [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], former president of Indonesia stated their concerns about recent developments in Malaysia that seem aimed at defaming Anwar Ibrahim and threatening him with imprisonment in a manner which is reminiscent of the campaign to defame him in 1998.  They stated there are plausible motives for some to manufacture a false case against him. They also mentioned that Anwar last year brought evidence to a royal commission that enabled it to conclude that there had been improper influence exerted on judicial appointments and more recently he brought forward evidence against the current attorney-general and the current inspector-general of police for the perversion of justice in his own prosecution in 1998-99. <ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1a03116e-6484-11dd-af61-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1, To defend Anwar is to defend Malaysian democracy]</ref> Abdurrahman Wahid has thrown in his support behind PKR de facto leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim saying he believes Anwar would usher in Islamic democracy if he becomes the next Prime Minister, describing Anwar and himself as "fighters for democracy in South-East Asia."  He said the recent swearing on the Quran by Anwar’s former aide Saiful Bukhari Azlan was un-Islamic. “I challenge anyone to prove the reverse. They better open the law books of Islam.”  <ref>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/18/nation/20080818143928&sec=nation,Swearing on Quran 'un-Islamic', says Gus Dur]</ref><ref>[http://malaysia-today.net/2008/content/view/11527/84/,Gus Dur: Swearing on Quran is un-Islamic]</ref>

===Controversy regarding evidence in the sodomy case===

Anwar Ibrahim demanded Tuesday [[29 July]], 2008 that police drop a sodomy investigation against him, producing a medical report he said showed no assault had taken place. Anwar reiterated that the allegations by a young male aide, a repeat of charges that saw him jailed a decade ago, have been fabricated to disrupt his plans to seize power from the coalition that has ruled here for half a century.  Anwar maintained that The Complainant is an outright liar working hand in glove with those in power, and that the aim is to assassinate his character and attempt to derail the Malaysian people's aspirations for change in Malaysia.  <ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia's Anwar says medical report makes lie of sodomy charges  |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080729/wl_afp/malaysiapoliticsanwar_080729073325 |work=AFP |publisher=Yahoo News |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2008-07-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia's Anwar says medical report makes lie of sodomy charges  |url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/267671.asp |work=TodayOnline |publisher=MediaCorp |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2008-07-29 }}</ref>

In a statutory declaration on [[August 1]], 2008 Dr Mohamed Osman Abdul Hamid, reiterated that he stood by his findings.  Dr Mohamed Osman also said he had no knowledge of how his medical examination report on Mohd Saiful was circulated to the media and Internet.  Some time in early July, he was visited by an officer from the Brickfields district police's criminal division, ASP Rosmi Mat Derus, who interviewed him about the medical examination on Mohd Saiful.  He said ASP Rosmi recorded the statement in in his own handwriting in Bahasa Malaysia.  The following week the same officer returned with a typed statement in Bahasa Malaysia for him to read and sign.  He claimed Anwar's name was never brought up during the first interview and Mohd Saiful also never confided to him about the identity of the alleged perpetrator.  <ref>{{cite news |title=Doc who examined Saiful stands by his report  |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/7/nation/20080807150623&sec=nation |work=TheStar Online |publisher=TheStar |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2008-08-07 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |title=Anwar’s Sodomy Charge Complicates Political Struggle   |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1374&Itemid=31 |work=Jed Yoong|publisher=Asia Sentinel |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2008-08-07 }}</ref>  On [[September 4]], 2008, Dr Osman spoke to the public for the first time restating that there was no evidence to back the alleged sodomy of the man who was accusing Anwar Ibrahim of sodomy.  "Please be assured that I had merely done my job as a doctor," Mohamed Osman told a news conference. "I am not involved in politics. I will always tell the truth."  <ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia: Anwar accuser not raped, says doctor |url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/ap/20080904/tap-as-malaysia-anwar-b3c65ae.html|work=Associated Press|publisher=Yahoo!

==Counter-allegations==

Anwar began to raise the stakes in his fight with the government by lodging a police report against its police chief and top lawyer for faking evidence against him in a similar case a decade ago.  Anwar  claims he has proof that Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri [[Musa Hassan]] and Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail concocted evidence for his corruption and sodomy trials in 1998 and 1999 which kept him imprisoned until he was freed in 2004.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{cite news |title=Anwar ups ante with police report against IGP, A-G |url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/2008/content/view/9431/ |work=Malaysian Insider|publisher=Malaysia Today |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2008-07-01 }}</ref>  In retaliation Musa Hassan sued Anwar Ibrahim for alleged defamation on 21 July, demanding unspecified compensation.  <ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia's police chief sues opposition leader Anwar for alleged defamation |url=http://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/ap/20080721/tap-as-malaysia-anwar-b3c65ae.html |work=Associated Press|publisher=Yahoo! News |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=2008-07-21 }}</ref>

On [[July 3]] [[2008]], Anwar presented allegations which claimed that the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[Najib Abdul Razak]], was involved in the [[Altantuya Shaariibuu]] murder case, and called for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the matter.  He showed a sworn statement by murder accused Abdul Razak Baginda's private investigator P. Balasubramaniam that claimed police suppressed evidence to protect some personalities, including proof that Altantuya knew Najib.<ref>{{cite news |title=Anwar alleges Najib linked to Altantuya case  |url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/home/42-lead-stories/1348-anwar-alleges-najib-linked-to-altantuya-case |work=Malaysian Insider|publisher=Malaysian Insider |date=2008-07-03 |accessdate=2008-07-03 }}</ref>.

Equally damaging for the prosecution’s case, Malaysia Today’s editor, [[Raja Petra Kamaruddin]], alleged that a top police official, Senior Assistant Commissioner Mohd Rodwan Mohd Yusof had met with Saiful three days before the charges were filed in room 619 of the Concorde Hotel. He stated that Rodwan and Saiful spoke on the telephone at least eight times before Saiful went to Hospital Puswari to report the supposed rape.<ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysian police on global manhunt for investigator who stirred politics with sex claim  |url=http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1381&Itemid=35 |work=Asia Sentinel|publisher=Asia Sentinel|date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref>

==Fuel price debate==

On [[July 6]], [[2008]], Anwar challenged the prime minister and his deputy to debate in the reduction of petrol prices.<ref>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/6/nation/20080706233209&sec=nation Anwar challenges PM and DPM to debate on fuel prices]. ''The Star Online''. [[2008-07-06]].</ref> He told a crowd of 20,000 supporters at an anti-inflation rally that the government should quit over a recent fuel price hike.  The stadium was ablaze with demonstrators wearing T-shirts in red, the colour of the protest movement.  The fuel price hike has heaped pressure on Abdullah after the March polls which handed the opposition its best ever result -- a third of parliamentary seats and control of five states. <ref>{{cite news |title=Anwar's opposition holds rally as Malaysian turmoil deepens |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080706/wl_asia_afp/malaysiainflationenergyprotestanwar_080706160515 |work=AFP|publisher=Yahoo News |date=2008-07-06|accessdate=2008-07-06 }}</ref>.

On [[July 15]], [[2008]], Anwar participated in a live televised debate with Information Minister Datuk [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]] entitled "Today We Form the Government, Tomorrow the Fuel Prices Will Go Down"<ref>{{cite news |title=Anwar and Shabery trade facts, pot shots |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/16/nation/21836068&sec=nation |work=AFP|publisher=The Star Newspaper|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2008-07-16 }}</ref>. The event was organised by online news portal Agenda Daily and was broadcast live over TV9, Astro Awani and Bernama TV. Anwar said it would only cost the Government RM5bil to bring down fuel prices by 50 sen and continued saying that RM2 billion could be saved by reducing the country’s electricity buffer of 40% to 20%, as the extra capacity only benefited independent power producers (IPP).<ref>{{cite news |title=Live debate: Shabery stands his ground against Anwar|url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Wednesday/National/2295015/Article/index_html |work=NST|publisher=News Straits Times|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> 

Anwar further hit out at the recent increase in fuel prices, saying such drastic measures within a short period had pushed inflation up which is detrimental to the economy and places an unnecessary burden on the people.  He said that fuel prices could be reduced if waste from corruption and inefficiency was eliminated. <ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysian opposition leader vows to cut fuel prices in unprecedented debate with govt minister |url=http://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/ap/20080716/tap-as-malaysia-fuel-debate-2nd-ld-write-b3c65ae.html |work=AFP | publisher=Yahoo News|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2008-07-16 }}</ref> The Minister hit back with several personal attacks on Anwar's character, including incidents which occurred during Anwar's time in office.
