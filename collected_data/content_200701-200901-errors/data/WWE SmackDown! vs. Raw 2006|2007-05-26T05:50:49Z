'''''WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006''''' ('''''Exciting Pro Wrestling 7''''' in [[Japan]]) is a [[professional wrestling]] [[video game]] released on the [[PlayStation 2]] [[video game console|console]] and the [[PlayStation Portable]] [[handheld game console|handheld console]] by [[THQ]] and developed by [[YUKE's Future Media Creators]]. It is part of the ''[[WWE SmackDown! (video game series)|WWE SmackDown!]]'' video game series based on the [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). It is the sequel to [[2004 in video gaming|2004]]'s ''[[WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW]]'' and was succeeded by ''[[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007]]'' in 2006.

The main focus of the game is to bring more realistic and authentic [[gameplay]] to the series with many new features, breaking away from the arcade-like gameplay that earlier games in the ''SmackDown!'' series possessed. As well as the addition of the new [[Buried Alive match|Buried Alive]] and Fulfill Your Fantasy matches, the game also included two new modes: [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling|General Manager]] and Create-An-Entrance. This also marked the first time a game in the ''SmackDown!'' series was published for a handheld console, as it was released on the PlayStation Portable.

==Gameplay==
===Match gameplay===
A new Momentum bar has been introduced to determine the flow of the match, replacing the old [[face (professional wrestling)|Clean]]/[[heel (professional wrestling)|Dirty]] and ''SmackDown!'' meters. The player also has to deal with a stamina bar which drains as the wrestlers fights; the more elaborate the move, the more the wrestler will tire, however this is an optional feature and can be removed in the options menu. The player has to regenerate their stamina bar to prevent becoming completely exhausted and unable to perform. Each character also has a new stamina attribute, making those with a low stamina rating tire more easily. Also included is a new [[hardcore wrestling|hardcore]] attribute, allowing those rated high to inflict more damage to their opponent with weapons. <ref name=IGN1>{{cite web | title=SmackDown vs. RAW 2006: World Premiere | publisher=IGN | last=Dunham | first=Jeremy | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/631/631085p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref>

Grapples have been improved, with each character having more specialized grapples types than the previous game's unchangeable group of four grapples. Each character has choice of three out of seven grapples: Power, Speed, Technical, Brawler, Martial Arts, Luchadore, and Old School. Each character has as well a Clean/Dirty grapple and a Submission grapple, making the total of grapples five. A new power [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|Irish whip]] has been included, giving more offense to the opponent but at the price of draining more stamina. <ref name=IGN7>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2006 Review | publisher=IGN | last=Dunham | first=Jeremy | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/664/664472p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> 

The arena crowd has also improved with fully 3D characters replacing the mixture of 3D and 2D characters in the previous game. <ref name=IGN4>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 | publisher=IGN | last=Dunham | first=Jeremy | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/638/638978p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref>

===Match types===
''WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006'' includes an improved [[steel cage match]], now allowing the player to escape through the cage's door. Along with this, a "Legend" cage match, which uses the old "blue grid" cage style popular in the [[1980s]] and through most of [[1990s]], has been added.<ref name=IGN4 /> The Bra and Panties match has been replaced by a Fulfill Your Fantasy match, which is based on the costume-based diva match that occurred on the [[WWE Cyber Sunday|Taboo Tuesday]] pay-per-view event. Unlike the real event which is more [[battle royal]] based, this version involves divas stripping their opponents to their bra and panties, spanking and throwing pillow shots instead.<ref name=IGN4 /> 

The [[Buried Alive match]], a feature requested by players for several years, finally makes its debut. The gameplay of the "Buried Alive" match is actually more reminiscent of a heavily improved [[casket match]] from ''[[WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role]]'', in that the player had to trap their opponent in a casket to show a [[cutscene]] of the burial.<ref name=IGN4 /> Backstage fights are also improved and now include random people, who can be interacted with, backstage passing by during matches. In total, 100 different match types are available.<ref name=IGN2>{{cite web | title=New SmackDown vs. RAW 2006 Details | publisher=IGN | last=Dunham | first=Jeremy | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/633/633214p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> 

The following match types are playable in this game:

†† This match type is available for online play but with four player only.<ref name=IGN6>{{cite web | title=SmackDown vs. RAW 2006: The Online Mode | publisher=IGN | last=Dunham | first=Jeremy | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/657/657279p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref>

===Game modes===
The series' trademark Season mode lasts for two in-game years, one for the ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'' brand and one for ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'' brand. The objective of the mode is to win both brands' two main championships, the [[WWE Championship]] and the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. The mode features 100 different motion-captured cinematic cut scenes, real-time storytelling and improved voice acting. Players have a choice of five original voices for created superstars. <ref name=IGN3>{{cite web | title=SmackDown vs. RAW 2006: The Season Mode | publisher=IGN | last=Dunham | first=Jeremy | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/653/653677p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> A new 3D customizable [[changeroom|locker room]] is also included. <ref name=IGN2 />

In contrast to the game's predecessor, some of the in-game legends also have voice-overs and are made playable in Season mode. In an interview, THQ designer Bryan Williams confirmed that only 32 superstars (which included legends [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Mick Foley|Mankind]], and [[Hulk Hogan]]) could be used in season mode. Some of the standard characters in the game cannot be used in Season mode. These wrestlers include [[Stevie Richards|Steven Richards]], [[Ric Flair]] and [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene]].

General Manager mode, which could be compared to the ''[[Extreme Warfare]]'' games and ''[[Fire Pro Wrestling|Final Fire Pro Wrestling's]]'' Management of the Ring mode is included for the first time. In this mode, the player takes the role of [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling|General Manager]] for either the ''SmackDown!'' or ''RAW'' brand. Players begin by picking one of the two brands, followed by a choice of simulating or participating in a [[WWE Draft|draft]], where a player can pick a total of 20 Superstars. The player then allocates the championships before beginning the season. This mode goes into depth, with [[electronic mail|email]] capabilities, the ability to [[booker (professional wrestling)|book]] matches and statistics of how the fans reacted to the show, among other features. When ''[[WrestleMania]]'' rolls around, the General Manager of the Year is awarded, along with some unlockable features. <ref name=IGN8>{{cite web | title=SmackDown 2006: General Manager Mode | publisher=IGN | last=Dunham | first=Jeremy | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/662/662051p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref>

As in the previous game, online play is available for those with a [[PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay|Sony Network Adapter]]. The title belts (including Create-A-Belt creations) can be defended online via a "virtual WWE Championship" with career leader boards and a permanent ID system that tracks all user stats. Players are also able to trade wrestlers created in the Create-A-Superstar mode with each other online. <ref name=IGN2 /> All [[#In-game arenas|arenas]] are also available for online play, including the unlockable ''[[WrestleMania IX]]'' Arena. <ref name=IGN6 />

===Create modes===
The game sports a variety of create modes. Create-A-Belt is a returning feature, with players now able to create Tag Team belts. Along with the created belts is inclusion of title belts used in WWE during 2005, the [[WWE Championship|WWE]], [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight]], [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental]], [[WWE United States Championship|United States]], [[WWE Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team]], [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team]], [[WWE Women's Championship|Women's]] and [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|Cruiserweight]] championships. [[Ted DiBiase]]'s [[Million Dollar Championship]] and the [[WWE Hardcore Championship]] can also be won and defended in the game. The game also allows the player to defend and challenge for any of the titles in the game in Exhibition mode, a feature which was missing in previous games. <ref name=IGN4 />

The Create-A-Superstar mode is much the same as the previous installments in this series. ''SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006'' adds a few new features, such as new items in the makeup category to give the player's created superstar more realistic facial features (such as wrinkles, a cleft chin, acne, and scars). Also included are new shirts and pants, which while unchangeable in color, look more realistic (as opposed to the "painted on" look of shirts from previous games). <ref name=IGN5>{{cite web | title=SmackDown vs. RAW 2006: Creation 101 | publisher=IGN | last=Dunham | first=Jeremy | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/655/655272p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref>

The game also includes a new Create-An-Entrance mode, allowing the player to customize a wrestler's entrance, down to details such as [[pyrotechnics]], arena lighting, and camera angles. <ref name=IGN2 /> The one minute limit for all entrances that was enforced in previous games is now abolished. <ref name=IGN4 />  Many people believed this was a great addition to this game, after years of requesting this feature. However, it received some criticism in comparison to sister game ''[[WWE Day of Reckoning 2]]'' which had more options, no loading times, and was easier to use.

==PlayStation Portable==
[[Image:WWE SmackDown vs RAW 2006 PSP (4).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Screenshot of the PSP version, featuring [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Randy Orton]].]]
For the first time in the ''SmackDown!'' series, this game is also available on the [[PlayStation Portable]]. Although it is very similar to the PS2 version, there are special features that are exclusive to this version that the PS2 version did not bear. Because of this, to unlock the full features of each game, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connectivity between the PS2 and PSP is needed.<ref name=IGNPSP1>{{cite web | title=WWE Smackdown! vs. Raw 2006 First-Look | publisher=IGN | last=Castro | first=Juan | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/658/658243p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref>

[[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]] is the exclusive PSP Legend and can only be played in the PS2 version by connecting the PSP to the PS2. However, before the PSP game was released, cheat devices also allowed Roberts to be unlocked. Other notable differences between the PS2 and PSP versions include the lack of in-ring commentary and the inclusion of voiceovers from the more popular superstars. The only major problem seen by most gamers was the game's horrendous loading times. <ref name=GameSpy>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 Review | publisher=GameSpy | last=McGarvey | first=Sterling | url=http://psp.gamespy.com/playstation-portable/professional-wrestling/677925p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-07}}</ref> They were so long that there was a warning about the load times when a created superstar is chosen for a match.

The PSP version include some features that weren't included in the PS2 version. These features include four exclusive [[minigame]]s that are playable from the start. All of these minigames offer single player and multiplayer modes. In multiplayer mode, players can make use of PSP's [[Wi-Fi]] functionality. Each mode allow up to four players to join in and play over a local connection.<ref name=IGNPSP1 />

The first minigame, ''WWE Game Show'', tests the knowledge of wrestling fans by offering 500 multi-layered wrestling questions. The ''WWE Game Show'' covers every wrestling topic imaginable including costumes, trends, [[music in professional wrestling|music]], finishers, styles, [[History of World Wrestling Entertainment|history]], [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] and more. Most questions include excerpts of songs and have players guess the tune or players are shown a video clip and must guess the match the clip is from.<ref name=IGNPSP2>{{cite web | title=WWE Smackdown! vs Raw 2006: The Mini-Games | publisher=IGN | last=Castro | first=Juan | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/664/664551p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> The questions ranged from easy to extremely difficult. Other minigames include a [[poker]] game and [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene's]] airplane game in which the player navigates Eugene around the ring in the fastest time.<ref name=IGNPSP3>{{cite web | title=No Limit Texas Hold 'Em Poker | publisher=IGN | last=Castro | first=Juan | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/670/670922p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref><ref name=IGNPSP4>{{cite web | title=WWE Smackdown vs RAW 2006: The Mini Games | publisher=IGN | last=Castro | first=Juan | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/666/666399p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref>

==Reception==
The reception to the game was generally positive, with an 84% rating on [[Game Rankings]] and an 82% rating on [[Metacritic]] for the PlayStation 2 version. <ref name=gamerankings>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 (PS2) Reviews | publisher=GameRankings.com | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/929017.asp |accessdate=2006-06-14}}</ref> <ref name=Metacritic>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 (PS2) Reviews | publisher=Metacritic.com | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/wwesmackdownvsraw2006 | accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> The reaction to the PlayStation Portable version was also positive with 81% and 80% ratings from Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. <ref name=gamerankings2>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 (PSP) Reviews | publisher=GameRankings.com | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/929239.asp |accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref> <ref name=Metacritic2>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 (PSP) Reviews | publisher=Metacritic.com | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/psp/wwesmackdownvsraw2006 | accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref> The game was praised by some critics for its depth of content. A [[GameSpot]] reviewer mentioned "the sheer breadth of content makes it an easy choice for any wrestling enthusiast, and quite possibly the best wrestling game available for the system." <ref name=GameSpot>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 for PlayStation 2 Review | publisher=GameSpot | last=Navarro | first=Alex | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/wwesmackdownvsraw2006/review.html?sid=6139963 | accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref>  Comparisons with the game and the highly acclaimed [[Nintendo 64]] game ''[[WWF No Mercy]]'' were made, with some reviewers putting the game on par with ''No Mercy''. An [[IGN]] reviewer commented that "there's no other wrestling game since ''No Mercy'' that offers this much replay, value, or depth", while a Netjak reviewer quoted "''WWF No Mercy'' on the Nintendo 64 ruled as the best wrestling game, but ''WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006'' is the new standard." <ref name=IGN7 /> <ref name=Netjak>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2006 - PlayStation 2 Review | publisher=Netjak | last=Farrow | first=Jimmy | url=http://www.netjak.com/review.php/1113 | accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref>

However, there were some complaints for the game's limitations of game modes. Critics such as [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]]'s reviewer felt that the General Manager mode "doesn't go as far as it should--no underhanded options--but it's a great start," while an eToychest reviewer quoted about the Season mode "for the first time through this more visual style of story has a lot going for it, but gameplay is about replayability, which is something that is sorely lacking here due to the limit placed on possible story arcs." <ref name=G4>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Review | publisher=G4 | last=Fischer | first=Russ | url=http://www.g4tv.com/xplay/features/53096/WWE_SmackDown_vs_RAW_2006_Review.html | accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref> <ref name=eToychest>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 | publisher=eToychest | last=Garlo | first=Steve | url=http://www.etoychest.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3099&Itemid=27&limit=1&limitstart=1 | accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref>

From the game's release up until December 2006, the game sold 3.3 million copies. <ref name=WWE.com>{{cite web | title=WWE Consumer Products | publisher=WWE.com | url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/consumer.jsp | accessdate=2006-10-13}}</ref> On [[October 23]], 2006, the game was added to [[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Sony's Greatest Hits]] collection. <ref name=GreatestHits>{{cite web | title=WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2006 Reaches 'Greatest Hits' Milestone for the PlayStation 2 Computer Entertainment System and PSP (PlayStation Portable) System | publisher=THQ | url=http://investor.thq.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96376&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=919396&highlight | accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref>

In July 2006, a 19-year-old German named Steffen G. murdered a homeless man with kicks and blows to his face. During his trial in December 2006, he claimed that the murder was caused by playing ''WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006'' against his friend earlier that day and losing all of his matches. The teen said that he wanted to imitate scenes of the game he remembered, and vented his frustration on the homeless man. Steffen G. was previously known to have alcohol problems along with family conflicts and was recorded to have blood alcohol level of 1.73 when stopped by police earlier on that day. <ref name=Steffen1>{{cite web | title=Homicide after playing a violent game | url=http://repository.wwe.com/news/statement_121106.pdf | last=Todt | first=Jens | publisher=Spiegel Online (translated by THQ Germany) | accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> In reaction to this, a WWE spokesman was quoted "Given Steffen G.'s history of violence and alcohol abuse, we believe his claims to be absurd." <ref name=Steffen2>{{cite web | title=Violent teen blames WWE | url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/3835548 | publisher=WWE.com | accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> A week later, the district court in [[Cottbus]] ruled out the idea that the game played a role in the homicide. <ref name=Steffen3>{{cite web | title=Video Game Defense Rejected | url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/35629181 | publisher=WWE.com | accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref>
