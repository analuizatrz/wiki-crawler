The '''rupee''' is the currency of [[Mauritius]]. It is divided into 100 ''cents''. The code of this currency is MUR.

The rupee was introduced into Mauritius in [[1877]], replacing the [[Indian rupee]], [[pound sterling|sterling]] and the [[Mauritian dollar]], with the Mauritian rupee equal to one Indian rupee or half a Mauritian dollar. The pound was worth 10¼ rupees at that time. 

Until 1934, the Mauritian rupee was directly tied to the [[Indian rupee]]. Although the denominations of the Indian rupee before decimalization in 1957 consisted of 3 Pies = 1 Pice (Paisa), 4 Pice = 1 Anna and 16 Anna = 1 Rupee, from the start Mauritius opted for the centesimal system of 100 cents to the rupee. The Mauritian currency also circulated in the [[Seychelles]] until 1914, when it was replaced by the [[Seychellois rupee]] at par.

==History==
The rupee was established by law in [[1876]] as the local currency of Mauritius. The reason for this choice, even if the country was then a British dependency, was the massive inflow of Indian rupees following Indian immigration to Mauritius. Sterling banknotes previously issued by the Treasury were withdrawn from circulation and replaced by 5, 10 and 50 rupees notes.

In [[1934]], a peg to [[British pound|sterling]] replaced the peg to the Indian rupee, at the rate of 1 rupee = 1 [[shilling]] 6 [[penny|pence]] (the rate to which the Indian rupee was also pegged).[http://users.erols.com/kurrency/mu.htm] This year also saw the first issue of silver ¼, ½ and 1 rupee coins. Silver coins were issued until [[1946]], with the first base metal replacements being issued in [[1950]].

As from [[1966]], [[Bank of Mauritius]] has been responsible for the issue of Mauritian rupee notes and coins. The Bank of Mauritius issued its first notes in [[1967]], comprising 4 denominations: 5, 10, 25 and 50 Mauritian Rupees. This set of banknotes went through four issues whose only variations which varied only in the signatures of the Governors and the Managing Directors of the Bank of Mauritius appointed during that period.

The Bank of Mauritius made its fifth issue [[1985]], which consisted of a complete new set of banknotes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 rupees. A close study of these banknotes reveals an interesting array of subsets which were printed by two banknote printing companies. The notes were also designed at different time periods as there are very few identical and consistent design features appearing on all the denominations. Varying banknote numbering systems, different types of security threads, variations in the design and size of the Mauritian Coat of Arms, different ultraviolet light latent printing, inconsistent variations in the size incrementation between the denominations and multiple different typesets are just a few of the differences. This issue lasted up to [[1998]].

In 1987, all new circulation coins bore the portrait of Sir [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]], which replaced the portrait of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].

In [[1998]], The Bank of Mauritius made a sixth issue of banknotes consisting of 7 denominations, viz. 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 rupees. These banknotes had a standard format and were all issued simultaneously in November 1998. All the banknotes of this issue were printed in England by “Thomas de la Rue Limited”. These banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in June [[1999]] following controversies.

The Bank of Mauritius made its seventh issue of banknotes, which is still current, after June 1999.
