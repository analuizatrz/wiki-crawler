Father '''Ferdinand Verbiest''' ([[October 9]] [[1623]] – [[January 28]] [[1688]]) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] in [[China]] during the [[Qing dynasty]]. He is known as Nan Huairen (南懷仁) in Chinese. He was an accomplished mathematician and astronomer and proved to the court of [[Kangxi Emperor]] that European astronomy was more accurate than Chinese astronomy (at the time). He then corrected the Chinese calendar and was later asked to rebuild and re-equip the [[Beijing Ancient Observatory]], being given the role of Head of the Mathematical Board and Director of the Observatory.

He became close friends with the [[Kangxi Emperor]], who frequently requested his teaching, in geometry, philosophy and music.

Verbiest worked as a diplomat and cartographer, and also as a translator, because he spoke [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Manchu]]. He wrote more than thirty books.

During the 1670s, Verbiest designed what some claim to be the first ever self-propelled vehicle – many 'sources' regard this as the world's first 'car' ([[automobile]]), ignoring its small size and the lack of evidence that it was actually built.

His call was to the Far East, where the Roman Catholic Church was 'on mission' to compensate for the loss of (Catholic) believers to the emerging [[Protestantism]] in Europe.<ref name=BelgPortal />

In 1658, Verbiest left for [[China]] from [[Lisbon]], accompanied by Father [[Martino Martini]], thirty-five other missionaries, the Viceroy of the Indies and some other passengers. Their boat reached [[Macao]] in 1659, by which time all but ten of the passengers, including the Viceroy and most of the missionaries, had died.<ref name=telescope >{{cite web

Unfortunately for them, the political situation shifted dramatically in 1661, on the death of the young  [[Shunzhi Emperor]], aged 23. His son and successor, [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]], was only 7, so the government was placed in the hands of four [[regent]]s. Unlike Shunzhi, the regents were not in favour of the Jesuits,<ref name=telescope /> who suffered increased persecution as a result.

===Astronomy contests===
The state religion of the Manchurian [[Qing dynasty]] incorporated aspects of [[shamanism]]. There was a tradition of public competitions between rival shamans to demonstrate their magic powers.  In 1664, the Chinese Muslim astronomer [[Yang Guangxian]] (1597-1669), who had published a pamphlet against the Jesuits, challenged Schall to a public astronomy competition. Yang won and took Schall's place as Head of Mathematics. Having lost the competition, Schall and the other Jesuits were chained and thrown into a filthy prison, accused of teaching a false religion. They were bound to wooden pegs in such a way that they could neither stand nor sit and remained there for almost two months until a sentence of strangulation was imposed. A high court found the sentence too light and ordered them to be cut up into bits while still alive.<ref name=Fairfield >{{cite web

  | accessdate =2008-03-20 }}</ref> Fortunately for them, on [[16 April]] [[1665]], a violent [[earthquake]] destroyed the part of the prison chosen for the execution. This was seen as an omen and all the prisoners were released. However, they still had to stand trial, and all the Jesuits, but Verbiest, Schall, and two others were exiled to [[Canton]]. Schall died within a year, due to the conditions of his confinement.<ref name=telescope />

In 1669, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] managed to take power by having the remaining (corrupt) regent, [[Oboi]], arrested. In the same year, the emperor was informed that serious errors had been found in the calendar for 1670, which had been drawn up by Yang Guangxian.  Kangxi commanded a public test to compare the merits of European and Chinese astronomy. The test was to predict three things: the length of the shadow thrown by a [[gnomon]] of a given height at noon of a certain day; the absolute and relative positions of the sun and the planets on a given date; and the exact time of an anticipated lunar eclipse. It was decided that Yang and Verbiest should each use their mathematical skills to determine the answers and that "The Heavens would be the judge". The contest was held at the Bureau of Astronomy in the presence of senior-ranking government ministers and officials from the observatory. Unlike Yang, Verbiest had access to the latest updates on the [[Rudolphine Tables]], and was assisted by telescopes for observation. He succeeded in all three tests, and was immediately installed as Head of the Mathematical Board and Director of the Observatory. Out of consideration for him, the exiled Jesuits were authorized to return to their missions. Meanwhile, Yang suffered the horrible death he had planned for his Jesuit rival.<ref name=CathEncyc /><ref name=telescope /><ref name=Fairfield />

===Initial projects===
The 1670 calendar included an extra month unnecessarily, added to hide other errors and to bring the lunar months in line with the solar year. Verbiest suggested the errors should be corrected, including removing the extra month. This was an audacious move, as the calendar had been approved by the emperor himself. Fearing the emperor's response, the observatory officials begged him to withdraw this request, but he responded: "''It is not within my power to make the heavens agree with your calendar. The extra month must be taken out.''" Much to their surprise, the emperor after studying the research, agreed, and it was done.<ref name=Fairfield />

After this, Verbiest and the emperor formed a real friendship, with the Jesuit teaching him [[geometry]], [[philosophy]] and music. He was frequently invited to the palace and to accompany the Emperor on his expeditions throughout the empire. He translated the first six books of [[Euclid]] into [[Manchu]] and took every opportunity to introduce Christianity. In response, the Emperor elevated him to the highest grade of the mandarinate and granted permission for him to preach Christianity anywhere in the empire.<ref name=Fairfield />

Verbiest undertook many projects, including the construction of an aqueduct, the casting of 132 cannons for the imperial army – far superior to any previous Chinese weapons – and the design of a new gun carriage. He created [[star chart]]s for the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in order to tell the time at night.<ref name="spence 15 16">Spence, 15&ndash;16.</ref>.  Other inventions included a steam engine to propel ships.

===Instruments for Beijing Observatory===
Having resolved the issues surrounding the calendar, Verbiest went on to compose a table of all solar and lunar eclipses for the next 2000 years. Delighted with this, the emperor awarded him complete charge of the imperial astronomy observatory, which he rebuilt in 1673. The existing equipment was obsolete, so Verbiest consigned it to a museum and set about designing six new instruments:<ref name=Fairfield />

* '''[[Altazimuth]]''', used to measure the position of celestial bodies relative to the celestial horizon and the zenith – the altitude azimuth.<ref>[http://hua.umf.maine.edu/China/astronomy/tianpage/0030Altazimuth6489.html The Altazimuth]</ref>
* '''Celestial globe''', six feet in diameter, used to map and identify celestial objects.<ref>[http://hua.umf.maine.edu/China/astronomy/tianpage/0031CelestialGlobe_6484w.html The Celestial Globe]</ref>
* '''Ecliptic armilla''', [[armillary sphere]], six feet in diameter, used to measure the ecliptic longitude difference and latitudes of celestial bodies.  (This was the traditional European device while the Chinese developed the equatorial armilla.)<ref>[http://hua.umf.maine.edu/China/astronomy/tianpage/0032EclipticArmilla6517bbbw.html The Ecliptic Armilla (armillary sphere)]</ref>
* '''Equatorial armilla''', armillary sphere, six feet in diameter,  used primarily for measuring true solar time as well as right ascension difference and declination of celestial bodies.<ref>[http://hua.umf.maine.edu/China/astronomy/tianpage/0034EquatorialArmilla6499w.html The Equatorial Armilla]</ref>
* '''Quadrant Altazimuth''', six feet in radius, for measuring altitudes or zenith distances of celestial bodies.<ref>[http://hua.umf.maine.edu/China/astronomy/tianpage/0035Quadrant6490w.html The Quadrant Altazimuth]</ref>
* '''[[Sextant (astronomical)|Sextant]]''', eight feet in radius, used to measure the angle of elevation of a celestial object above the horizon. It is used to calculate the angle between two objects, although it is limited to 60 degrees of arc. In navigation, it is used to to take a measure of the angle of the sun at noon to determine latitude.<ref>[http://hua.umf.maine.edu/China/astronomy/tianpage/0036Sextant5431w.html The Sextant]</ref>  

These were all very large, made of brass and highly decorated, with bronze dragons forming the supports. Despite their weight, they were very easy to manipulate, demonstrating Verbiest's aptitude for mechanical design.

===Final days===
Verbiest died in [[Beijing]] shortly after receiving a wound from falling off a bolting horse.<ref name="spence 12">Spence, 12.</ref> He was succeeded as the chief mathematician and astronomer of the Chinese empire by another [[Belgian]] Jesuit, [[Antoine Thomas]] (1644-1709). His remains were buried near those of two other famous Jesuits – [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Adam Schall von Bell|Adam Schall]] – on [[March 11]], [[1688]]. Visiting their tomb is not easy, since it is on the campus of a College of Political Science, but it is well-maintained.<ref name=Fairfield /> Verbiest was the only Westerner in Chinese history to ever receive the honour of a posthumous name by the Emperor.

== Verbiest's 'car' ==
Beside his work in astronomy, Verbiest also experimented with steam. Around 1672 he designed – as a toy for the Chinese Emperor – a steam-propelled trolley which was, quite possibly, the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').<ref name=CuriousExp>{{cite web | title = A brief note on Ferdinand Verbiest | publisher = Curious Expeditions | date = [[02 July]] [[2007]] | url = http://curiousexpeditions.org/?p=52 | accessdate = 2008-03-18}}</ref>  Verbiest describes it in his work ''Astronomia Europea''.  As it was only 60cm long, and therefore effectively a scale model, not designed to carry human passengers, nor a driver, it is not strictly accurate to call it a 'car'.

Steam was generated in a ball-shaped boiler, emerging through a pipe at the top, from where it was directed at a simple, open '[[steam turbine]]' (rather like a [[water wheel]]) that drove the rear wheels.

It is not known if Verbiest's model was ever built at the time, although he had access to China's finest metal-working craftsmen who were constructing precision astronomical instruments for him.

===The Brumm model===
The Italian model manufacturer [[Brumm]] produced a non-working 1:43 scale model of the ''Veicolo a turbina de Verbiest (1681)'' [sic],<ref>{{PDF|[http://www.brumm.it/2002/pdf/Copionidelmondo_01i.pdf Brumm model catalogue (2001)]|1.28&nbsp;MB}} – ''Verbiest's vehicle is in the "Old Fire" range on pp10-11''</ref> in their "Old Fire" range of 2002. This model was 9cm long, which, when scaled-up, would have suggested that Verbiest's original would have been nearly 4 metres in length.

However, comparison with drawings in Hardenberg's study show that this model is not the same as Verbiest's. It is actually modelled on a small steam turbine car built in the late 18th century (presumably 1775) by a German mechanic. Unfortunately, the original was probably destroyed during a bombing raid on the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe during World War II. However, a photo of the original car can be seen at the Deutsches Museum. Hardenberg notes that this steam turbine car operated on the same principle as Verbiest's carriage (the impulse turbine), but employed a more modern arrangement of the drive train. <ref>[http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~erik/local_heroes.html The Leuven Local Heroes in Thermal Sciences and Engineering (Accessed: [[22 March]] [[2008]])]</ref>
