'''''Outrageous Betrayal: The Dark Journey of Werner Erhard from est to Exile''''', first published in 1993, is a [[biography]] of [[Werner Erhard]] written by legal [[journalism|journalist]] [[Steven Pressman]]. Pressman first became interested in writing a book about Werner Erhard in 1991 while he was working as a journalist for ''[[California Lawyer]]'', and performed research and investigative work for the book from 1991 to 1993. He conducted interviews during research for the book, and utilized documents from court transcripts and previously published accounts.

The book gives an account of Werner Erhard's early life, his exploration of various forms of [[self-improvement]] techniques including [[Scientology]] and [[Mind Dynamics]], and his foundation of [[Erhard Seminars Training]] "est" and later [[Werner Erhard and Associates]] and the est successor course, "The Forum".  Pressman details the quick financial success Erhard had with these companies, as well as controversies relating to litigation involving some former participants in his courses.  The work concludes by going over the impact of a March 3, 1991 ''[[60 Minutes]]'' broadcast on [[CBS]] where family members made allegations of abuse against Erhard, and his decision to leave the United States.

''Outrageous Betrayal'' received generally positive reception. The book has been cited for historical background on Erhard and his companies within the [[United States House of Representatives]], as well as in several works on [[psychology]], [[cult]]s and [[new religious movement]]s.

Representatives of Werner Erhard and of [[Landmark Education]], the successor company to The Forum, expressed dissatisfaction with the book. During the course of his research for the book Pressman received multiple letters from Werner Erhard's attorney Walter Maksym, and in 1994 the Chairman of Landmark Education Art Schreiber referred to the book as "defamatory". In 1998, Landmark Education attempted to compel Steven Pressman to reveal the unnamed sources he had consulted while researching ''Outrageous Betrayal.'' This matter was later dropped after Landmark Education settled litigation against the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN).  As a result of this settlement, CAN agreed not to sell copies of ''Outrageous Betrayal'' for at least five years after it emerged from [[bankruptcy]].

==Research==
Pressman first became interested in writing a book about Werner Erhard in 1991 while he was working as a journalist for ''California Lawyer''.<ref name="pressmandeclaration" /> He conducted interviews and research, and succeeded in landing a book contract with St. Martin's Press.<ref name="pressmandeclaration" /> From 1991 to 1993 Pressman spent most of his time performing [[investigative journalism|investigative work]], research and interviews for the book.<ref name="pressmandeclaration" /> In the Acknowledgments section of ''Outrageous Betrayal'', Pressman wrote that he relied upon both named and unnamed sources for information in the book, in addition to "previously published accounts, court transcripts, depositions, and other documents in which various individuals have recounted earlier conversations".<ref name="pressman" /> In an article on [[fair use]] for ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', Pressman noted that he "gathered reams of written materials -- some of it private and confidential -- that were helpful in drawing a comprehensive portrait of my subject".<ref name="foulingupfairuse" /> Pressman wrote that legal counsel for the book's publisher insisted on numerous changes to the book "in order to reduce, if not eliminate, the possibility of a successful suit for copyright infringement".<ref name="foulingupfairuse" />

By 1993, Pressman and St. Martin's Press had received approximately two dozen letters from Erhard's attorney Walter Maksym, though Erhard's representatives had yet to see the book itself.<ref name="ross">{{Harvnb|Ross|1993|p=B5}}</ref> Maksym told the ''[[San Francisco Daily Journal]]'' in March 1993 that he wanted to "fact check the book", because he believed that "this is a first-time unknown author who apparently has interviewed only people who have negative things to say", and stated "We have cautioned the publisher that they are responsible for the accuracy of the book."<ref name="ross" /> Charlie Spicer, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, described the actions of Erhard's representatives with regard to the book as "a desperate campaign by someone with something to hide".<ref name="ross" />

== Contents ==
In ''Outrageous Betrayal'', Steven Pressman gives a chronological account of Werner Erhard's life and businesses, from high-school years through his formation of companies that delivered [[Large Group Awareness Training|awareness training]] and the later controversies surrounding his business and family life.  The book goes into detail regarding his early life as Jack Rosenberg and his name change to Werner Erhard, his move to [[California]], and the initial inspirations behind the training that would come to be known as "est."  Pressman writes that Erhard was inspired by the [[self-help]] course [[Mind Dynamics]], [[cybernetics]], the book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' by [[Napoleon Hill]], and ''[[Psycho-Cybernetics]]'' by [[Maxwell Maltz]], and by [[Scientology]] and the writings of [[L. Ron Hubbard]].  He also notes how Erhard was helped in the formation of his first awareness training company, [[Erhard Seminars Training]], by an attorney skilled in [[Taxation in the United States|tax law]].<ref name="publishers" /><ref name="library" /><ref name="booklist" />

Pressman notes how Erhard and his businesses became successful within two years of foundation, and writes that his awareness training programs trained over half a million people in his courses and brought in tens of millions of dollars in revenue.  The book then describes controversies relating to both Erhard's businesses and his reported treatment of his family.  Pressman details some of the lawsuits and professional desertions that hurt his business, as well as some of his conflict with the [[Internal Revenue Service]].  The end of the book describes the impact and aftermath of a March 3, 1991 ''[[60 Minutes]]'' [[investigative journalism|investigation]] on [[CBS News]], where one of his daughters accused him of [[sexual abuse]].  Pressman also describes the successor company to est, [[Werner Erhard and Associates]], and Erhard's decision to sell the "technology" of his course The Forum to his employees and leave the United States. The book's epilogue includes a firsthand account of a Forum seminar led by trainer Laurel Scheaf in 1992.<ref name="publishers" /><ref name="library" /><ref name="kirkus" /><ref name="booklist" /><ref name="pressman01161994">{{cite news  | last =Pressman | first =Steven | title =Soul Revival at the Forum - No one calls it est or mentions Werner Erhard anymore, but the New Age movement he founded is still hawking personal transformation to the masses | work =[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date =January 16, 1994 }}</ref>

The review noted: "Pressman here cuts into him with surgical precision."<ref name="publishers">{{Harvnb|Publishers Weekly staff|1993|p=446}}</ref> Frances Halpern of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the book a "damning biography".<ref name="halpern">{{cite news | last =Halpern | first =Frances | title =On Hope, Blacklisting and Rancho Mirage Trio of new titles offered by Barricade Books includes one by poet and novelist Aram Saroyan, a Thousand Oaks resident | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | page =9 | date =October 14, 1993|quote='Outrageous Betrayal,' a new and damning biography by Steven Pressman.}}</ref> A review by Mary Carroll published in the [[American Library Association]]'s ''[[Booklist]]'' noted that the controversy surrounding Erhard was not new, but she wrote that "Pressman pulls the details together effectively."<ref name="booklist">{{Harvnb|Carroll|1993|p=7}}</ref>  Carroll went on to comment: "''Outrageous Betrayal'' is a disturbing but fascinating object lesson in the power of charisma divorced from conscience."<ref name="booklist" />
