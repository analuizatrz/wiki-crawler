In [[Vedic religion]], '''Varuna''' ([[Devanāgarī|Devanagari]]:वरुण, [[IAST]]:''{{IAST|varuṇa}}'') is a god of the [[sky]], of [[rain]] and of the [[celestial ocean]], as well as a god of [[law]] and of the [[underworld]]. He is the most prominent [[Asura]] in the [[Rigveda]], and chief of the [[Adityas]].

==Vedic and other roles==
As chief of the [[Adityas]], Varuna has aspects of a [[solar deity]]. As the most prominent [[Asura]], however, he is more concerned with moral and societal affairs than a deification of nature. Together with [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]] – originally [[oath]] personified &mdash; being master of [[rta]], he is the supreme keeper of order  and god of the [[law]].

Varuna and Mitra are the gods of the [[oath]], often twinned or identified as '''Mitra-Varuna''' (a [[dvandva]] compound). Varuna is also twinned with [[Indra]] in the Rigveda, as ''Indra-Varuna''.

As a sky god, Varuna may either correspond to, or rule over, the dark half of the sky &mdash; or [[celestial ocean]] ([[Rasā]]), hence being also a god of [[rain]] &mdash; or represent the 'dark' side of the [[Sun]] as it travels back from West to East during the night.

The [[Atharvaveda]]<ref>Shaunakiya Atharvaveda 4.16, corresponding to Paippalada 5.32.</ref>  portrays Varuna as omniscient, catching liars in his snares. The stars are his thousand-eyed spies, watching every movement of men.

In the [[Rigveda]], [[Indra]], chief of the [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s, is about six times more prominent than Varuna, who is mentioned 341 times. This may misrepresent the actual importance of Varuna in early Vedic society due to the focus of the Rigveda on [[fire ritual|fire]] and [[Soma]] ritual, Soma being closely associated with Indra; Varuna with his omniscience and omnipotence in the affairs of men has many aspects of a supreme deity.

Both Mitra and Varuna are classified as [[Asura]]s in the Rigveda (e.g. [[RV 5]].63.3), although they can already be addressed to as [[Deva]]s as well (e.g. [[RV 7]].60.12), possibly indicating the beginning of the negative connotations carried by ''Asura'' in later times.

Varuna later became the god of [[ocean]]s and [[river]]s and keeper of the souls of the drowned. As such, Varuna is also a god of the dead, and can grant [[immortality]]. He is attended by the [[Naga (mythology)|naga]]s.  He is also one of the [[Guardians of the directions]], representing the west.

Later art depicts Varuna as a [[lunar deity]], as a yellow man wearing golden armor and holding a noose or lasso made from a [[snake]].  He rides the sea monster ''[[Makara]]''.

Varuna's role may be compared to that of [[Poseidon]] in [[Greek_mythology|Greek mythology]].

==In Zoroastrianism==
:''See Also [[Zoroastrianism and Hinduism#Ahuras versus Devas|Asuras versus Devas]]''
When Zarathustrianism was established, Shri Varuna who Zarathustra referred to as the Ahura Mazda (Rigvedic Assur Mehda or Assur Mahadeo) was God Almighty while all other spirits were given the status of angels. Like the Rigvedic Varuna, the Avestan Ahura Mazda is too associated with the [[Rita]] (Avestan Asha), the cosmic order.
