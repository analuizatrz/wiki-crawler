The '''[[flag]] of the [[United States]]''' consists of 13 equal horizontal stripes of [[red]] (top and bottom) alternating with [[white]], with a [[blue]] rectangle in the [[Flag terminology|canton]] bearing 50 small, white, [[Star (symbol)|five-pointed star]]s arranged in nine offset horizontal rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternating with rows of five stars.  The 50 stars on the flag represent the [[U.S. state|50 U.S. states]] and the 13 stripes represent the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] that rebelled against the British crown and became the first states in the Union. Nicknames for the flag include "'''the Stars and Stripes'''" and "'''Old Glory'''," with the latter nickname coined by Captain [[William Driver]], a 19th-century shipmaster.

Because of its symbolism, the starred blue canton is called the "union."  This part of the national flag can stand alone as a [[maritime flag]] called the '''Union Jack''' (no relation to the [[Union Flag|flag of the United Kingdom]] this term more commonly refers to).  The Union Jack served as the [[naval jack]] for U.S. warships until 2002, when it was replaced by the so-called [[First Navy Jack]] as part of the [[War on Terrorism]].  However, the Union Jack continues to be used as a jack by U.S. vessels outside the Navy, including those of the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

In [[blazon]]s (a [[vexillology|vexillological]] description using [[flag terminology]]), the U.S. flag is described as "a banner ''Gules'', six bars ''Argent''; the canton ''Azure'' charged with 50 mullets ''Argent''." This means "a red flag with six white horizontal stripes; the upper quarter nearest the hoist is blue with 50 white stars."

==Symbolism==
One of the most widely used symbols of the United States is its flag. The national flag is widely used within the United States, and is frequently displayed, not only on public buildings, but on private residences, as well as iconically in forms such as decals for car windows, and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins.

Many citizens understand the flag to represent the freedoms and rights guaranteed in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and perhaps most of all to be a symbol of individual and personal liberty as set forth in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].  Through the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] and other political uses the flag has also come to be associated with U.S.A. [[nationalism]], [[patriotism]], and even [[militarism]].  The flag is a complex and contentious symbol, around which emotions run high.

In terms of the symbolism of the design itself, a book about the flag published by the Congress in 1977 states:
"The star is a symbol of the heavens and the divine goal to which man has aspired from time immemorial; the stripe is symbolic of the rays of light emanating from the sun."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usflag.org/colors.html| title=What do the colors of the Flag mean?| work=USFlag.org: A website dedicated to the Flag of the United States of America| accessdate=June 14| accessyear=2005}}</ref>
[[George Washington]] is credited for saying:
"We take the stars from Heaven, the red from our mother country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing Liberty."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www1.va.gov/opa/feature/celebrate/Flag.asp| title=The United States Flag - Public and Intergovernmental Affairs| work=United States Department of Veterans Affairs| accessdate=December 7| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Many people also take the red and white to stand for the blood of those who gave their lives for freedom, and the presumed purity of the freedom ideal, respectively.

== Design ==
=== Specification ===

[[Image:Flag of the United States specification.svg|400px|right|Diagram of the flag's design]]

The basic design of the flag is specified by sections 1 and 2 of Title 4, [[United States Code]] (4 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2 (2004)). Executive Order 10834 which may be found as a note to section 1, specifies the proportions of the flag and the arrangement of the stars in the union. [http://assembler.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode04/usc_sec_04_00000001----000-notes.html].  The specification gives the following values:

* Hoist (width) of flag: A = 1.0
* Fly (length) of flag: B = 1.9
* Hoist (width) of Union: C = 0.5385 (7/13, spanning seven stripes)
* Fly (length) of Union: D = 0.76 (1.9 × 2/5, two fifths of the flag length)
* E = F = 0.0538 (C/10, One tenth the width of the Union)
* G = H = 0.0633 (D/12, One twelfth the length of the Union)
* Diameter of star: K = 0.0616
* Width of stripe: L = 0.0769 (1/13)

Due to rounding, the above numbers are inconsistent, in that G and H do not fill up the width of the union, and E and F do not fill the height.<!-- Then why not give the correct numbers? -->

=== Flag ratios ===

Note that the flag ratio (B in the diagram) is not absolutely fixed by law.  Although the diagram in Executive Order 10834 gives a ratio of 1.9, earlier in the order is a list of flag sizes authorized for executive agencies.  This list permits eleven specific flag sizes (specified by height and width) for such agencies:  20.00 x 38.00; 10.00 x 19.00; 8.95 x 17.00; 7.00 x 11.00; 5.00 x 9.50; 4.33 x 5.50; 3.50 x 6.65; 3.00 x 4.00; 3.00 x 5.70; 2.37 x 4.50; and 1.32 x 2.50.  Eight of these sizes conform to the 1.9 ratio, within a small rounding error (less than 0.01).  However three of the authorized sizes vary significantly:  1.57 (for 7.00 x 11.00), 1.27 (for 4.33 x 5.50) and 1.33 (for 3.00 x 4.00).

=== Colors ===

According to [[Flags of the World]], the colors are specified by the [[General Services Administration]] "Federal Specification, Flag, National, United States of America and Flag, Union Jack," DDD-F-416E, dated [[November 27]], [[1981]]. It gives the colors by reference to "[[Standard Color Cards of America]]" maintained by the [[Color Association of the United States]], Inc., as:

According to the book, "Our Flag" published by the House of Representatives, "The colors red, white, and blue did not have meanings for The Stars and Stripes when it was adopted in 1777." It goes on to say, on page 41 (page 47 of the PDF version)<ref>{{cite book| author=United States Government| title=Our Flag| publisher=United States Government Printing Office| location=Washington DC| year=1861| format=PDF| id=S. Doc 105-013| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_documents&docid=f:sd013.105.pdf}}</ref> that the colors of the [[Great Seal of the United States]], when it was adopted in 1782, were defined thus: "White signifies Purity and Innocence; Red, Hardiness and Valor; Blue signifies Vigilance, Perseverance and Justice."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/06/20010607-1.html| title=A Proclamation by the President: Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2001| work=The White House| accessdate=December 7| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Union===
One legend states the union of the current 50-star flag was designed by [[Robert G. Heft]] in 1958 while living with his grandparents in [[Ohio]]. He was 18 years old at the time and did the flag design as a class project.  His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a B- for the project.  After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered.  Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after [[Alaska]] and before [[Hawaii]] was admitted into the union in 1959.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usflag.org/flagdesigner.html| title=Robert G. Heft: Designer of America's Current National Flag| work=USFlag.org: A website dedicated to the Flag of the United States of America| accessdate=December 7| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

At the time, credit was given by the [[Executive Department]] to the [[U.S. Army Bureau of Heraldry]] for the design.

The reality is that when Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for Statehood, more than 1,500 designs were spontaneously submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower by Americans. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three, and probably more, of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag. These designs are in the Eisenhower Presidential Archives in Abilene, Kansas. Only a small fraction of them have ever been published.

=== Decoration ===

Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with [[Gold (color)|golden]] [[fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag itself as long as it does not deface the flag proper.  Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in [[parade]]s or on indoor posts, often utilize fringe to enhance the beauty of the flag.  The first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the [[United States Army|Army]] used it officially in 1895.  No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] approves the use of fringe "...at the descretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy...".  The United States [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|Institute of Heraldry]] also confirms that there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.
<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/FAQ/FringeOnAmFlg.htm| title=Fringe on the American Flag| accessdate=June 27| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

== Flag Etiquette ==
The [[United States Flag Code]] outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag.  For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the [[ensign]] responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. (This tradition comes from the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], where countries were asked to dip their flag to [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]: the American team captain [[Martin Sheridan]] refused, famously proclaiming that "this flag dips to no earthly king."<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/06/24/olympics_history_feature.shtml London Olympics 1908 & 1948]</ref>) 

Although the Flag Code is U.S. Federal law, there is no penalty for failure to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforced &mdash; indeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the [[First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]].  Passage of the proposed [[Flag Desecration Amendment]] would overrule legal precedent that has been established in this area.


===Half-Staff Observation===
Section 7m of the Flag Code reads:

The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff. By order of the President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their memory. In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. In the event of the death of a present or former official of the government of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, the Governor of that State, territory, or possession may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at half-staff. The flag shall be flown at half-staff 30 days from the death of the President or a former President; 10 days from the day of death of the Vice President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department, a former Vice President, or the Governor of a State, territory, or possession; and on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress. The flag shall be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day, unless that day is also Armed Forces Day.

== Display ==

The flag is customarily flown year-round from most public buildings, and it is far from unusual to find private houses flying full-size flags.
Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like [[Memorial Day]], [[Veteran's Day]], [[Presidents' Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]], [[Flag Day in the United States|Flag Day]], and on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]]. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans.

=== Places of continuous display ===
[[Image:Apollo 14 Shepard.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] raises the United States Flag on the surface of the [[moon]] during the [[Apollo 14]] mission.]]

By presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, American flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.

* Replicas of the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] (15 stars, 15 stripes) are flown at two sites in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]: [[Fort McHenry|Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine]] (Presidential Proclamation No. 2795, [[July 2]], [[1948]]) and [[Flag House Square]] (Public Law 83-319, approved [[March 26]], [[1954]]).

* [[USMC War Memorial|United States Marine Corps War Memorial]] ([[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]), [[Arlington, Virginia]] (Presidential Proclamation No. 3418, [[June 12]], [[1961]]).

* [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] Town Green (Public Law 89-335, approved [[November 8]], [[1965]]).

* The [[White House]], [[Washington, DC]] (Presidential Proclamation No.4000, [[September 4]], [[1970]]).

* Fifty U.S. Flags are displayed continuously at the [[Washington Monument]], Washington, DC. (Presidential Proclamation No. 4064, [[July 6]], [[1971]], effective [[July 4]], [[1971]]).

* By order of [[Richard Nixon]] at [[United States Customs Service]] Ports of Entry that are continuously open (Presidential Proclamation No. 4131, [[May 5]], [[1972]]).

* By Congressional decree, a Civil War era flag (for the year 1863) flies above Pennsylvania Hall (Old Dorm) at [[Gettysburg College]].  This building, occupied by both sides at various points of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], served as a lookout and battlefield hospital.

* Grounds of the National Memorial Arch in [[Valley Forge National Historical Park|Valley Forge NHP]], [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]] (Public Law 94-53, approved [[July 4]], [[1975]]).

* Mount Slover limestone quarry ([[Colton Liberty Flag]]), in [[Colton, California]] (Act of Congress). First raised [[July 4]], [[1917]].[http://www.calportland.com/coltons-libertyflag.htm]

* Washington Camp Ground, part of the former [[Middlebrook encampment]], [[Bridgewater, New Jersey]], Thirteen Star Flag, by Act of Congress.

* By custom, at the [[Maryland]] home, birthplace, and grave of [[Francis Scott Key]]; at the [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] war memorial; at the [http://www.taosgov.com/recreation/taos-plaza.htm plaza] in [[Taos, New Mexico]] (since 1861); at the [[United States Capitol]] (since 1918); and at [[Mount Moriah Cemetery (South Dakota)|Mount Moriah Cemetery]] in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]].

* In addition, the American flag is presumed to be in continual display on the surface of the Earth's [[The Moon|Moon]], having been placed there by the astronauts of [[Apollo 11]], [[Apollo 12]], [[Apollo 14]], [[Apollo 15]], [[Apollo 16]], and [[Apollo 17]]. It is possible that Apollo 11's flag was knocked down by the force of return to lunar orbit.

== History ==

[[Image:COA George Washington.svg|left|thumb|100px|The Washington family [[coat of arms]].  This design is thought by some to be the source of the red-and-white stripe motif of the United States flag, but that is unlikely.]]
[[Image:Grand Union Flag.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] Continental Colors or Grand Union Flag.]]
[[Image:Flag of the British East India Company (1707).svg|200px|right|thumb|Flag of the British East India Company, 1707&ndash;1801]]

The flag has gone through 26 changes since the new union of 13 states first adopted it. The 48-star version holds the record, 47 years, for the longest time the flag has gone unchanged. The current 50-star version will tie the record if it is still in use on [[July 4]], [[2007]].

At the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, [[July 4]], [[1776]], one commonly flown flag was the [[Continental Colors]]. This flag may have been initially flown by order of George Washington and it is thought it was first raised by Washington's troops at [[Somerville, Massachusetts#History|Prospect Hill]] on [[New Year's Day]] in 1776, although there is good reason to believe the flag was actually the King's Colors. At the time of the [[American Revolution]] the East India Company flag would have been identical to the [[Grand Union Flag]]. The flag probably inspired the Stars and Stripes (as argued by Sir [[Charles Fawcett]] in 1937). [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-eic2.html] Comparisons between the Stars and Stripes and the Company's flag from historical records present some convincing arguments. The John Company flag dates back to the 1600s whereas the United States adopted the Stars and Stripes in 1777[http://www.kimber.org/flag/index.htm]. This flag formed the basis of the Stars and Stripes, consisting of 13 red and white stripes (although sometimes red-white-blue stripes were used) with the original British [[Union Jack]] in the canton. The Grand Union Flag is similar to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] flag of the same era [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-eic2.html], although the East India Company flag could have from 9 to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean {{fact}}.

The red-and-white stripe &mdash; and later, stars-and-stripes &mdash; motif of the flag may have been based {{fact}} on the Washington family [[coat of arms|coat-of-arms]], which consisted of a shield "''argent'', two ''bars gules'', above, three ''mullets gules''" (a white shield with two red bars below three red stars). 
A 14th century stained-glass image of the coat of arms can be found on the "Washington Window" in [[Selby Abbey]] in [[Selby]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]].  Since 1937, the District of Columbia has used [[Flag of Washington, D.C.|a flag based on this design]]. However, it is much more likely that it is based on the flag of the [[Sons of Liberty]], which used a 13 red and white stripe combination.

[[Image:Bennington flag.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] Bennington flag. This flag was most likely not used at the [[Battle of Bennington]]]]

On [[June 14]], [[1777]], the [[Continental Congress#The Second Continental Congress|Second Continental Congress]] passed the Flag Resolution which stated: "Resolved, That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation."  [[Flag Day in the United States|Flag Day]] is now observed on June 14 of each year. A false tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June of 1777 by the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Middlebrook encampment]].<ref>Guenter (1990)</ref>

The Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement for the stars. The pictured flag shows the thirteen stars arranged in a circle, the so-called [[Betsy Ross]] flag. Although the Betsy Ross legend is not taken seriously by many historians, the design itself is the oldest version of any US flag to appear on any physical relic: it is historically referenced in contemporary battlefield paintings by John Trumbull and Charles Willson Peale, which depict the circular star arrangement. Popular designs at the time were varied and most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. Given the scant archeological and written evidence, it is unknown which design was the most popular at that time.

[[Image:US flag 13 stars – Betsy Ross.svg|left|thumb|200px|[[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] 13-star "Betsy Ross" flag]]

In 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter.  It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired [[Francis Scott Key]] to write "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]," now the [[national anthem]].  

Finally in 1818, a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid<ref>{{cite book| author=United States Government| title=Our Flag| publisher=United States Government Printing Office| location=Washington DC| year=1861| format=PDF| id=S. Doc 105-013| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_documents&docid=f:sd013.105.pdf}}</ref> in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, and a new star would be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would remain at thirteen to honor the [[Thirteen Colonies|original colonies]]. 

[[Image:US flag 15 stars.svg|right|thumb|200px|[[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] 15-star, 15-stripe "Star-Spangled Banner" flag]]

When the flag design changes, the change always takes place on [[July 4]], as a consequence of the [[Flag Acts (U.S.)|Flag Act]] of [[April 4]], [[1818]]. [[July 4]], [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] in the United States, commemorates the founding of the [[nation]]. The most recent change, from forty-nine stars to fifty, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after [[Hawaii]] gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of [[Alaska]] in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.

[[Image:US flag 48 stars.svg|thumb|200px|left|[[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] 48-star flag, was in longest use (1912-1959) of all versions until July 2007]]

The origin of the U.S. flag design is uncertain. A popular story credits [[Betsy Ross]] for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch by George Washington who personally commissioned her for the job.  However, no evidence for this theory exists beyond Ross' descendants' much later recollections of what she told her family.  Another woman, Rebecca Young, has also been credited as having made the first flag by later generations of her family. Rebecca Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]]. The British historian Sir [[Charles Fawcett]] has suggested that the design of the flag may have been derived from the [[flag]] and [[jack (flag)|jack]] of the [[British East India Company]]. [http://www.kimber.org/flag/index.htm Comparisons] between the 2 flags support Fawcett's suggestion. Another popular theory is that the flag was designed by [[Francis Hopkinson]]. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a bill to Congress for his work. He asked for a "Quarter Cask of the Public Wine" as payment initially. The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress. It should be noted that no one at the time contested his claim to have designed the flag.

=== First salute ===

[[The Netherlands]] were the first country to salute the Grand Union flag, when gun salutes by American ships were returned by officials on Dutch islands in the [[West Indies]] in late 1776: on [[St. Croix]] in October, and on [[Sint Eustatius|St. Eustatius]] in November. (Though later, the better documented St. Eustatius incident involving the [[USS Andrew Doria (1775)|USS ''Andrew Doria'']] is traditionally regarded as the "first salute".) [[France]] was the first country to salute the Stars and Stripes, when a fleet off the French mainland returned a gun salute by Captain [[John Paul Jones]] commanding the [[USS Ranger (1777)|USS ''Ranger'']] on [[February 14]], [[1778]].[http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq40-1.htm]

=== US stars and design duration ===

In the following table depicting the 27 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for each flag are merely the ''usual'' patterns, often associated with the [[United States Navy]]. With the exception of the 48-, 49-, and 50-star flags, as there was no official arrangement of the stars until the proclamation of the 48-star flag by President [[William Howard Taft]] on [[29 October]] [[1912]]. The exact ''colors'' of the flag were not standardized until 1934.  (For alternate versions of the flag of the United States, see the [http://www.fotw.net/flags/us-ststr.html Stars of the U.S. Flag page] at the [[Flags of the World]] website.)

==== Symmetry ====

Most of these arrangements of stars exhibit some form of [[symmetry]].

* [[Symmetry]] with respect to horizontal axis: 50, 49, 48, 46, 44, 38, 37, 36, 34, 33, 32, 30, 28, 26, 24, 20, 15, 13 (standard)
* Symmetry with respect to vertical axis: 50, 48, 46, 45, 44, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 21, 20, 15, 13 (standard and Betsy Ross)
* Both, hence also point symmetry: 50, 48, 46, 45, 44, 37, 36, 34, 33, 32, 28, 26, 24, 20, 15, 13 (standard)
* No symmetry: 43, 
* Chessboard pattern: 50, 49, 45, 15, 13 (standard)
* Rectangle of stars: 48, 35, 30, 28, 24, 20

== Future of the flag ==

[[Image:US flag 51 stars.svg|thumb|right|[[Image:FIAV proposal.svg|23x15px]] Proposed design for a [[United States 51-star flag|51-star flag]] in the event of an additional state]]

The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] has plans for flags with up to 56 stars using a similar staggered star arrangement in case additional states accede.

There are ongoing statehood movements in [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], and the [[District of Columbia voting rights|District of Columbia]].

==Non-standard flags==
[[Image:Guilford Court House flag.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Guilford Court House Flag]]
A number of non-standard flags appeared in the early years of American independence. One example is the design approximated here, of a flag traditionally believed to have been carried by the American troops at the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]] in 1781. This is disputed by some other historians who think it dates to the 19th century. The original flag is at the North Carolina Historical Museum.

== Similar flags ==
[[Image:Flag of Liberia.svg|thumb|Flag of [[Liberia]]]][[Image:Flag of Malaysia.svg|thumb|Flag of [[Malaysia]]]]

The [[flag of Liberia]] bears close resemblance to the flag of the United States, showing the ex–American-slave origins of the country. The Liberian flag has similar red and white stripes, though only 11 of them, as well as a blue square for the union, but with only a single large white star.

The [[flag of Malaysia]] is inspired by the flag of the United States, and displays the [[star and crescent]], a traditional symbol of [[Islam]].
