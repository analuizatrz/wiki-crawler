'''Dantian''' or '''Tan t'ien''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: '''Dāntián''' [[wiktionary:丹|丹]][[wiktionary:田|田]]; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: '''Tanden''' 丹田; [[Korean language|Korean]]: 단전''' DanJeon''' 丹田; [[Thai language|Thai]] '''Dantian''' ตันเถียน) which literally means "cinnabar or red field" and is loosely translated as "elixir field". It is described as an important focal point for internal meditative techniques and refers specifically to the physical [[center of gravity]] located in the abdomen three finger widths below and two finger widths behind the navel.  

The dantian is important in [[Neidan]], [[qigong]], [[neigong]], [[Tao Yin|tao yin]] and other breathing techniques, as well as for [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and is also widely used throughout [[East Asia]]n [[meditation]] and [[martial art]]s theory, especially the [[neijia]] school of [[Chinese martial arts]] and [[Tai Chi Chuan]].<ref>T'ai Chi Ch'uan and Meditation by Da Liu, page 92 - Routledge and Keegan Paul 1987 ISBN 0140192174</ref><br />

According to principles of [[Chinese alchemy]] there are three dantians in the body:
The lower [[dantian]] is located 1.3 inches below the navel and is also called the golden stove.<ref>Taoist Yoga by Lu K'uan Yu page 10. (Rider , 1970)</ref><br /> 
The middle dantian is in the heart and in Western [[anatomy]] is associated with the [[Thymus gland]].<br />
The upper dantian is in the brain just behind a point directly between the eyebrows and corresponds to the [[Third eye]], in Western [[anatomy]] this point corresponds to the [[Pituitary gland]].<ref>The doctrine of the elixir by R. B. Jefferson Coombe Springs Press 1982 chapter 4. The Archaic Anatomy of Individual Organs</ref>[http://duversity.org/elixir/]<ref>T'ai Chi Ch'uan and Meditation by Da Liu, page 92 - Routledge and Keegan Paul 1987 ISBN 0140192174</ref>.<br />

In speaking specifically of the lower of the three points, the term dantian is often used interchangeably with the Japanese word '''hara''' (腹; Chinese: '''fù''') which literally means simply "belly". In [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese tradition, it is considered the physical center of gravity for the human body and by extension the seat of one's internal energy ([[qi]]). A master of [[calligraphy]], [[swordsmanship]], [[tea ceremony]], martial arts or comparable disciplines is held in the Japanese tradition to be "acting from the hara". (However it should be noted that whereas the dantian is a fixed location anatomical region of the body that the centre of gravity is a theoretical concept and can move about even moving outside of the body in relation to the movement of the limbs.)

[[Taoist]] and [[Buddhist]] teachers often instruct their students to center their mind in dantian, held to aid control of [[thought]]s and [[emotion]]s. Therefore, acting from the dantian is considered to be related to the state of [[samadhi]]. 

The dantian also roughly corresponds to the [[India]]n concept of the [[manipura]], or navel [[chakra]] in [[yoga]] philosophy, thought to be the seat of [[prana]] that radiates outwards to the entire body. <ref>T'ai Chi Ch'uan and Meditation by Da Liu, pages 91-92 - Routledge and Keegan Paul 1987 ISBN 0140192174</ref><br />
