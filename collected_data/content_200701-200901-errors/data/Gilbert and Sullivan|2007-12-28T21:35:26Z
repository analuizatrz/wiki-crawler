'''Gilbert and Sullivan''' refers to the [[Victorian era]] partnership of [[librettist]] [[W. S. Gilbert]] (1836–1911) and [[composer]] [[Arthur Sullivan]] (1842–1900). Together, they wrote fourteen [[comic operas]] between 1871 and 1896, of which ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and ''[[The Mikado]]'' are among the best known.<ref>{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Peter G |date=[[January 21]], [[2002]] |title=Smooth Sailing |work=New York |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/classical/reviews/5596/ |accessdate= 2007-11-06 }}</ref>

Gilbert, who wrote the words, created fanciful topsy-turvy worlds for these operas, where each absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion—fairies rub elbows with British lords, flirting is a capital offence, gondoliers ascend to the monarchy, and pirates turn out to be noblemen who have gone wrong.<ref name=Leigh>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Leigh |authorlink=Mike Leigh |title=True anarchists |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1938719,00.html |work=The Guardian |date=[[November 4]], [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-11-06 }}</ref> Sullivan, seven years younger than Gilbert, composed the music, contributing memorable melodies<ref>[[George Grove|Sir George Grove]]: "Form and symmetry he seems to possess by instinct; rhythm and melody clothe everything he touches; the music shows not only sympathetic genius, but sense, judgement, proportion, and a complete absence of pedantry and pretension; while the orchestration is distinguished by a happy and original beauty hardly surpassed by the greatest masters." {{cite news |title=Arthur Sullivan 1842–1900 |url=http://www.musicaltimes.co.uk/archive/obits/190012sullivan.html |work=The Musical Times |date=December 1900 |accessdate=2007-11-06 }}</ref> that could convey both humour and pathos.<ref>Gian Andrea Mazzucato in ''The Musical Standard'' of [[December 16]] [[1899]]: "[Sullivan]... will... be classed among the epoch-making composers, the select few whose genius and strength of will empowered them to find and found a national school of music, that is, to endow their countrymen with the undefinable, yet positive means of evoking in a man's soul, by the magic of sound, those delicate nuances of feeling which are characteristic of the emotional power of each different race."

==Beginnings==
===Gilbert before Sullivan===
{{Further|[[W. S. Gilbert]]}}
Gilbert was born in London on [[November 18]], [[1836]].  His father [[William Gilbert (author)|William]] was a naval surgeon who later wrote novels and short stories, some of which included illustrations by his son.<ref name=CrowtherLife>Crowther, Andrew. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html ''The Life of W. S. Gilbert''.] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref> In 1861, the younger Gilbert began to write illustrated stories, poems and articles of his own to supplement his income.  Many of these would later be mined as a source of ideas for his plays and operas, particularly his series of illustrated poems called the [[Bab Ballads]].<ref>Stedman, pp. 26–29, 123–24, and the introduction to Gilbert's ''[[Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales]]''</ref>  
[[Image:Gentle Alice Brown.jpg|thumb|210px|left|One of Gilbert's illustrations for his [[Bab Ballads|Bab Ballad]] "Gentle Alice Brown"]]
In the Bab Ballads and his early plays, Gilbert developed a unique "topsy-turvy" style, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd. [[Mike Leigh]] describes the "Gilbertian" style as follows:
{{cquote|With great fluidity and freedom, [Gilbert] continually challenges our natural expectations.  First, within the framework of the story, he makes bizarre things happen, and turns the world on its head.  Thus the Learned Judge marries the Plaintiff, the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes, and so on, and nearly every opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts....  His genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand, to blend the surreal with the real, and the caricature with the natural. In other words, to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way.<ref name=Leigh/>}}
[[Image:Ages Ago.png|''[[Ages Ago]]'', during the rehearsals for which [[Frederic Clay]] introduced Gilbert to Sullivan.|thumb|300px]]
Gilbert developed his innovative theories on the art of stage direction, following theatrical reformer [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]].<ref name=CrowtherLife /> At the time Gilbert began writing, theatre in Britain was in disrepute.<ref>Bond, Jessie.[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/introduction.htm ''The Reminiscences of Jessie Bond: Introduction''] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]]. Bond created the [[mezzo-soprano]] roles in most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and is here leading in to a description of Gilbert's role in reforming the Victorian theatre.</ref>  Gilbert helped to reform and elevate the respectability of the theatre, especially beginning with his six short family-friendly comic operas, or "[[German Reed Entertainments|entertainments]]," for [[Thomas German Reed]].<ref>Stedman, pp. 62–68; Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/introduction.htm The Reminiscences of Jessie Bond:  Introduction.] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]]. </ref>

At a rehearsal for one of these entertainments, ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869), the composer [[Frederic Clay]] introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer [[Arthur Sullivan]].<ref name=CrowtherAgesAgo>Crowther, Andrew. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html Ages Ago&mdash;Early Days.] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref> Two years later, Gilbert and Sullivan would write their first work together.  Those two intervening years continued to shape Gilbert's theatrical style.  He continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas ''[[Our Island Home]]'' (1870) and ''[[A Sensation Novel]]'' (1871), and the blank verse comedies ''[[The Princess]]'' (1870), ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1870), and ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea]]''.

===Sullivan before Gilbert===
{{Further|[[Arthur Sullivan]]}}
Sullivan was born in London on [[May 13]] [[1842]].  His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of 8, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band.  In school he began to compose [[anthem]]s and songs. In 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn Prize and studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and at [[Leipzig]], where he also took up [[conducting]].  His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of [[The Tempest (Sullivan)|incidental music]] to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]''. Revised and expanded, it was performed at [[the Crystal Palace]] in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto, and several overtures, among them the ''[[Overture di Ballo]]'', in 1870.<ref>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/lawrence/lawrence_1.html Interview by Arthur H. Lawrence, Part 1], ''The Strand Magazine'', Volume xiv, No.84 (December 1897) See also [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/letters/001.html Sullivan's Letter to ''The Times''], [[October 27]] [[1881]], Issue 30336, pg. 8 col C</ref>
[[Image:Crystal Palace.PNG|thumb|left|250px|[[The Crystal Palace]], where several early Sullivan works premiered.]]

His early major works for the voice included ''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]'' (1864); an [[oratorio]], ''[[The Prodigal Son (Sullivan)|The Prodigal Son]]'' (1869); and a dramatic [[cantata]], ''On Shore and Sea'' (1871).  He composed a ballet, ''[[L'Île Enchantée]]'' (1864) and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays.  Other early pieces that were praised were his ''[[Symphony in E, Irish|Symphony in E]]'', ''[[Cello Concerto (Sullivan)|Concerto for Cello and Orchestra]]'', and ''[[Overture in C (In Memoriam)]]'' (all three of which premiered in 1866).<ref>Shepherd, Marc, [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/sullorch.htm ''Discography of Sir Arthur Sullivan: Orchestral and Band Music''] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Discography. Includes descriptions of the works, Retrieved [[2007-06-10]].</ref>  These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat.  He worked as a church organist and composed numerous [[hymn]]s, popular songs, and [[parlour ballads]].<ref name=Turnbull>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/sullivan2a.html Stephen Turnbull's Biography of W. S. Gilbert] at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, Retrieved [[2006-11-22]]</ref>

Sullivan's first foray into comic opera was ''[[Cox and Box]]'' (1866), written with librettist [[Francis Cowley Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] for an informal gathering of friends. Public performance followed, with W. S. Gilbert (then writing dramatic criticism for ''Fun'') saying that Sullivan's score "is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded."<ref>Harris, Roger, ed. (1999). Cox and Box. Chorleywood, Herts., UK: R. Clyde. pp. X–XI</ref> Sullivan and Burnand followed their success with a second comic opera, ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (1867).

==Operas==
===First collaborations: ''Thespis'' and ''Trial by Jury''===
;''Thespis''
[[Image:Thespis - Illustrated London News Jan 6 1872.png|320px|thumb|A contemporary illustration of ''Thespis'' from [[The Illustrated London News]] of January 6, 1872]]In 1871, producer [[John Hollingshead]] brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to produce a Christmas entertainment, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', at his [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], a large [[West End theatre|West End]] house.  The piece was an [[extravaganza]] in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, one of whom is the eponymous [[Thespis]], the Greek father of the drama. Its mixture of political satire and [[grand opera]] parody mimicked [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach's]] ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'' and ''[[La belle Hélène]]'', which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.<ref>Tillett, Selwyn and Spencer, Roderic (2002). {{PDFlink|[http://www.chimesmusicaltheatre.co.uk/Thespis.pdf "Forty Years of Thespis Scholarship".]|1.45&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1523385 bytes -->}}. Chimes Musical Theatre,  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]]</ref><ref>Jean-Bernard Piat: ''Guide du mélomane averti'', Le Livre de Poche 8026, Paris 1992</ref>

''Thespis'' opened on [[Boxing Day]] and ran for 63 performances. It outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, but no one at the time anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration. Unlike the later G&S works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert's earlier [[travesty|travesties]], with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors.  Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned. The musical score to ''Thespis'' was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and the Act II ballet.

Over the next four years, Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again, but each man became more eminent in his field. Gilbert worked with Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872) and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), as well as writing several other libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas, adaptations from novels, and translations from the French. Sullivan completed his ''Festival [[Te Deum]]'' (1872); another oratorio, ''The Light of the World'' (1873); his only [[song cycle]], ''[[The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens]]'' (1871); [[incidental music]] to ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1874); and more songs, parlour ballads, and [[hymn]]s, including "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]" (1872).

;''Trial by Jury''
In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short libretto on commission from producer–composer [[Carl Rosa]], whose wife would have played the leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project and left the libretto an orphan. Not long afterwards, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] was managing the [[Royalty Theatre]], and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Périchole]]''. Gilbert already had available the libretto he had written for Rosa, and Carte suggested that Sullivan write the score. The composer was delighted with it, and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was composed in a matter of weeks.<ref>Barker, John W. [http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.html "Gilbert and Sullivan"], Madison Savoyards, Ltd., Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]], quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of ''Trial by Jury'' to him: "As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time."</ref>  

[[Image:Ushertrial.jpg|left|thumb|200px|"Now, Jurymen, hear my advice": ''[[Trial by Jury]]'']]The piece is one of Gilbert’s humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession, based on his brief experience as a [[barrister]]. It concerns a [[breach of promise]] of marriage suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since "he is such a very bad lot," while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks "substantial damages." After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself. With Sullivan's brother, [[Fred Sullivan|Fred]], as the Learned Judge, the opera was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of ''La Périchole''. Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed.<ref>Walbrook, H. M. (1922), [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/walbrook/chap3.html ''Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, a History and Comment'' (Chapter 3).] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University,  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref>

Fred Sullivan was the prototype for the "[[patter song|patter]]" (comic) [[baritone]] roles in the later operas. [[F. C. Burnand]] wrote that he "was one of the most naturally ''comic little men'' I ever came across. He, too, was a first-rate practical musician.... As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest...."<ref>Ayer p. 408</ref>  Fred's creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators' works, and each of them has a crucial ''comic little man'' role, as Burnand had put it.  The "patter" baritone (or "principal comedian", as these roles later were called) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas, and was usually allotted the speedy [[patter song]]s.

After the success of ''Trial by Jury'', Gilbert and Sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte was one of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte also proposed a revival of ''Thespis'' for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but he was unable to obtain financing for the project.
{{-}}

===''Sorcerer'' to ''Pirates''===
;''The Sorcerer''
Carte's real ambition was to develop an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy [[burlesque (genre)|burlesques]] and badly translated French [[operetta]]s then dominating the London stage. He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company, with Gilbert and Sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening's entertainment.

[[Image:Sorc-Pin-Trial.jpg|thumb|360px|An early poster showing scenes from ''The Sorcerer'', ''Pinafore'', and ''Trial by Jury'']]Gilbert found a subject in one of his own short stories, "The Elixir of Love," which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village. The leading character was a [[Cockney]] businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular). Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that ''The Sorcerer'' opened as a fully polished production, in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed ''Thespis''.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/sorcerer/html/index.html ''The Sorcerer''] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive,  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref>  While ''The Sorcerer'' won critical acclaim, it did not duplicate the success of ''Trial by Jury''.  Nevertheless, Carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full-length opera from the team.

;''H.M.S. Pinafore''
Gilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878), satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in ''The Sorcerer'', love between members of different social classes).  As with many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story.

Gilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage.<ref>Gilbert was strongly influenced by the innovations in 'stagecraft', now called stage direction, by the playwrights [[James Planche]] and especially [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]].  See Gilbert, W. S., [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/stage_play.html ''A Stage Play'']; and Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/introduction.htm Introduction], etc.</ref> He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity.<ref name=Cox>Cox-Ife, William. ''W. S. Gilbert: Stage Director''. Dobson, 1978 ISBN 0-234-77206-9.</ref>  Gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which was something new to many actors of the day.<ref name=Cox/> Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation.  The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre.<ref>"That Gilbert was a good director is not in doubt. He was able to extract from his actors natural, clear performances, which served the Gilbertian requirements of outrageousness delivered straight."[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1938719,00.html [[Mike Leigh]] interview]</ref><ref>Baily, p. 335</ref>

''H.M.S. Pinafore'' ran in London for 571 performances, the second longest run of any musical theatre piece in history up to that time (after the [[operetta]] ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'').<ref>[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html List of longest running London shows up to 1920]</ref>  Hundreds of unauthorized, or "pirated", productions of ''Pinafore'' appeared in America.<ref>Rosen, Zvi S.

Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].  See also Prestige, Colin.  "D'Oyly Carte and the Pirates", a paper presented at the International Conference of G&S held at the [[University of Kansas]], May 1970</ref>  During the run of ''Pinafore'', Richard D'Oyly Carte split up with his former investors. The disgruntled former partners, who had each invested in the production with no return, staged a public fracas, sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance. Stagehands successfully managed to ward off their backstage attackers.<ref>[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-opcom.html Article about the fracas during ''Pinafore'' at the Opera Comique]</ref>  This event cleared the way for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan to form the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which then produced all of their succeeding operas.

The libretto of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' relied on [[stock character]] types, many of which were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist ([[tenor]]) and his love-interest ([[soprano]]); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue ([[contralto]]); the baffled lyric [[baritone]]&mdash;the girl's father; and a classic villain ([[bass-baritone]]).  Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic [[patter song|patter-singing character]].  With the success of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types.  Before ''The Sorcerer'', Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with ''Thespis'' and ''Trial by Jury''. Building on the team he had assembled for ''The Sorcerer'', Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.

The repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', then join the army as Major-General Stanley in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and so on.  Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in ''The Sorcerer'' transformed into Little Buttercup in ''Pinafore'', then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in ''Pirates''. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage.  These included [[George Grossmith]], the principal comic; [[Rutland Barrington]], the lyric baritone; [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]], the bass-baritone; and [[Jessie Bond]], the [[mezzo-soprano]] [[soubrette]].

;''The Pirates of Penzance''
[[Image:Pirate King1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''[[The Pirates of Penzance|The Pirate King]]'']]''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (New Year's eve, 1879), conceived in a fit of pique at the [[United States|American]] [[copyright]] pirates,<ref>[http://www.edwardsamuels.com/illustratedstory/isc10.htm Article about copyright pirating, focusing on Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte's efforts]</ref> also poked fun at [[grand opera]] conventions, sense of duty, family obligation, the "respectability" of civilisation and the peerage, and the relevance of a liberal education.  The story also revisits ''Pinafore'''s theme of unqualified people in positions of authority, in the person of the [[Major General's Song|"modern Major-General"]] who has up-to-date knowledge about everything except the military.  The Major-General and his many daughters escape from the tender-hearted Pirates of Penzance, who are all orphans, on the false plea that he is an orphan himself.  The pirates learn of the deception and re-capture the Major-General, but when it is revealed that the pirates are all [[peerage|peers]], the Major-General bids them: "resume your ranks and legislative duties, and take my daughters, all of whom are beauties!"

The piece premiered first in New York rather than London, in an (unsuccessful) attempt to secure the American copyright, and was another big success with both critics and audiences.<ref>[http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/pirates/pp2.html Transcription of an opening night review in New York]</ref>  Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963540 Article on the pirating of G&S operas (and other works) and the development of performance copyrights]</ref>  Nevertheless, ''Pirates'' was a hit in both New York, again spawning numerous imitators, and then in London, and it became one of the most frequently performed, translated and parodied Gilbert and Sullivan works, also enjoying a successful 1981 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival by [[Joseph Papp]].

In 1880, Sullivan wrote the [[cantata]] ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'', presented at the [[Leeds]] Triennial Music Festival, with a libretto modified by Gilbert from an 1822 epic poem by [[Henry Hart Milman]] concerning the martyrdom of [[Margaret the Virgin|St. Margaret of Antioch]] in the 3rd century.  Sullivan became the conductor of the Leeds festival beginning in 1880 and conducted the performance.  It could be said that ''Martyr'' was the 15th opera of the partnership, since the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] presented the work as an opera in 1898.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/martyr/index.html Web page devoted to ''Martyr'' at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive]</ref>

===Savoy Theatre opens: ''Patience'' to ''Princess Ida''===
;''Patience''
[[Image:Grossmith as Bunthorne.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[George Grossmith|Grossmith]] as Bunthorne in ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'']]
''[[Patience (operetta)|Patience]]'' (1881) satirised the [[aesthetic movement]] in general and its colourful poets, in particular, combining aspects of [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[James McNeill Whistler]] and others in the rival poets Bunthorne and Grosvenor.  Grossmith, who created the role of Bunthorne, based his makeup, wig and costume on Swinburne and especially Whistler, as seen in the adjacent photo.<ref>Ellmann, Richard ''Oscar Wilde'', (Knopf, 1988) pp. 135 and 151-152 ISBN 0-394-55484-1</ref> The work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military.  The story concerns two rival "aesthetic" poets, who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village, who had been engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment.  But the two poets are each in love with Patience, the village milkmaid, who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him.  Richard D'Oyly Carte was the booking manager for [[Oscar Wilde]], a then lesser-known proponent of aestheticism, and dispatched Wilde on an American lecture tour in conjunction with the opera's U.S. run, so that American audiences might better understand what the satire was all about.  

During the run of ''Patience'', Carte built the large, modern [[Savoy Theatre]], which became the partnership's permanent home. It was the first theatre (indeed the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting.<ref>See [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SavoyTheatre.htm this article on the Savoy Theatre] from arthurlloyd.co.uk, Retrieved on [[2007-07-20]].  See also [http://www.theambassadors.com/savoy/info/index.html this article from the Ambassador Theatre Group Limited]</ref>  ''Patience'' moved into the Savoy after six months at the Opera Comique and ran for a total of 578 performances, surpassing the run of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' and becoming the second longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time in history.<ref name=Cloches>The longest was the [[operetta]] ''[[Les Cloches de Corneville]]'', which held the title until ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' in 1886.  See [http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html this article on longest runs in the theatre up to 1920]</ref>

;''Iolanthe''
''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882) was the first of the operas to open at the Savoy. The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects, such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies. The opera poked fun at English law and the [[House of Lords]] and made much of the war between the sexes.  The critics felt that Sullivan's work in ''Iolanthe'' had taken a step forward.  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote, "The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account ''Iolanthe'' his best effort in all the Gilbertian series."<ref>Quoted in Allen 1975b, p. 176</ref>  Similarly, the ''Theatre'' asserted that "the music of ''Iolanthe'' is Dr Sullivan's ''chef d'oeuvre''. The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works...."<ref>William Beatty-Kingston, ''Theatre'', [[1 January]] [[1883]], quoted in Baily 1966, p. 246</ref>

''Iolanthe'' is one of a number of Gilbert's works, including ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873), ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875), ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884) and ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' (1909), where the introduction of men and "mortal love" into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/html/broken_hearts_synopsis.html Article on ''Broken Hearts'' from the G&S Archive]</ref>  Gilbert had created several "fairy comedies" at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in the early 1870s.  These plays, influenced by the fairy work of [[James Planché]], are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/223/0815.html ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes'' (1907–21).

[[Image:Barnett as Fairy Queen.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Alice Barnett|Barnett]] as The Fairy Queen]]In 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study.  Gilbert had referred to the new technology in ''Pinafore'' in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service.  Sullivan had one installed as well, and on [[May 13]] [[1883]], at a party to celebrate the composer's 41st birthday, the guests, including the [[Prince of Wales]] (later [[Edward VII]]), heard a direct relay of parts of ''Iolanthe'' from the Savoy.  This was probably the first live "broadcast" of an opera.<ref>Bradley (1996), p. 176</ref>

During the run of ''Iolanthe'', in 1883, Sullivan was [[British honours system|knight]]ed by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].  Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera&mdash;that a musical [[knighthood|knight]] should not stoop below oratorio or [[grand opera]].<ref>Baily, p. 250</ref>  Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious.  Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in  February 1883, just after ''Iolanthe'' opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.<ref name=Carpet/>

;''Princess Ida''
[[Image:Ida men.gif|right|thumb|250px|Princess Ida forswears the world of men.]]''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884) spoofed [[women's education]] and [[male chauvinism]] and continued the theme from ''Iolanthe'' of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poem ''The Princess: A Medley''. Gilbert had written a [[blank verse]] farce based on the same material in 1870, called ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]'', and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of ''Princess Ida''.  ''Ida'' is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts.  [[Lillian Russell]] had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, she was dismissed.<ref>Stedman, pp. 200-01</ref>

''Princess Ida'' was the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership's previous standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales.  The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after ''Ida'' opened, Sullivan told Carte that "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself."<ref name=Carpet/>  As ''Princess Ida'' showed signs of flagging, Carte realized that, for the first time in the partnership's history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed.  On [[22 March]] [[1884]], he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months' time.<ref>Jacobs, p. 187</ref>  In the meantime, when ''Ida'' closed, Carte produced a revival of ''The Sorcerer''.

===Dodging the magic lozenge: ''The Mikado'' to ''The Gondoliers''===
;''The Mikado''
The most successful of the Savoy Operas was ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly diguised by a Japanese setting.  Gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic lozenge that would change the characters,<ref>Gilbert eventually found another opportunity to present his "lozenge plot" in ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'', written with [[Alfred Cellier]] in 1892</ref> which Sullivan found artificial and lacking in "human interest and probability", as well as being too similar to their earlier opera, ''The Sorcerer''.  As dramatised in the film ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]'',<ref>albeit with the repetition of the apocryphal sword-falling story, see Jones, Brian (Spring 1985), "The sword that never fell", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'' 1 (1): 22–25</ref> the author and composer were at an impasse until [[8 May]] [[1884]], when Gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements.  

[[Image:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Lithograph of the "Three Little Maids" from ''The Mikado'']]The story focuses on a "cheap tailor," Ko-Ko, who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu.  Ko-Ko loves his ward, Yum-Yum, but she loves a musician, who is really the son of the emperor of Japan (the Mikado), and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous Katisha.  The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu.  When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town, Ko-Ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether Ko-Ko has carried out the executions.  Too timid to execute anyone, Ko-Ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the Mikado, which goes awry.  Eventually, Ko-Ko must persuade Katisha to marry him, in order to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators.

With the opening of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan.  Gilbert said, {{cquote|I cannot give you a good reason for our... piece being laid in Japan.  It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public.<ref>[http://www.lyricoperasandiego.com/Education/MikadoGenesis.htm Quoted at Lyricoperasandiego.com]</ref>}}

Setting the opera in [[Japan]], an exotic locale far away from Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings.  Gilbert wrote, "The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution."<ref>[http://pamphletpress.org/index.cfm?sec=7&story_id=69 Review of ''The Mikado'' discussing the depiction of Japan in ''The Mikado'']</ref>  [[G. K. Chesterton]] compared it to [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'': "Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did....  I doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese.  But all the jokes in the play fit the English.... About England Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth."<ref>[http://www.lyricoperasandiego.com/Education/MikadoGenesis.htm Lyric Opera San Diego site]</ref>  Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales, including ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', ''[[Utopia Limited]]'', and ''[[The Grand Duke]]''.

''The Mikado'' became the partnership's longest-running hit, enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time.<ref>The longest-running piece of musical theatre was the [[operetta]] ''[[Les Cloches de Corneville]]'', which held the title until ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' in 1886.

;''Ruddigore''
''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), a topsy-turvy take on Victorian [[melodrama]], was less successful than most of the earlier collaborations with a run of 288 performances.  The original title, ''Ruddygore'', together with some of the plot devices, including the revivification of ghosts, drew negative comments from critics.<ref>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/html/appeal.html See the [[Pall Mall Gazette]]'s satire of ''Ruddygore''.]  Gilbert's response to being told the two spellings meant the same thing was: "Not at all, for that would mean that if I said that I admired your ruddy countenance, which I do, I would be saying that I liked your bloody cheek, which I don't."  See [http://hcs.harvard.edu/hrgsp/old/productions/rud68/rud68arg.htm this article at Harvard's website] and [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~melbear/witter.htm this information from the Australian G&S site.]</ref>  Gilbert and Sullivan respelled the title and made a number of changes and cuts.<ref>A copy of the ''Ruddigore'' libretto, including material cut before the first night and during the initial run, is {{PDFlink|[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/ruddygore.pdf available here.]|294&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 301170 bytes -->}}</ref>  Nevertheless, the piece was profitable,<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/html/intro.html Information from the book ''Tit-Willow or Notes and Jottings on Gilbert and Sullivan Operas''] by Guy H. and Claude A. Walmisley (Privately Printed, Undated, early 20th century)</ref> and the reviews were not all bad.  For instance, the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' praised the work and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: "Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun."<ref>[http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/ruddigore/rud5.html ''Illustrated London News'' Review of ''Ruddygore'' dated 9 January 1887]</ref>  Further changes were made, including a new overture, when [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] revived ''Ruddigore'' after the [[First World War]], and the piece was regularly performed by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company thereafter.<ref>Critical apparatus in Hulme, David Russell, ed., ''Ruddigore''. Oxford: Oxford University Press (2000)</ref> 

Some of the plot elements of ''Ruddigore'' were introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors stepping out of their portraits.  When Ruddigore closed, no new opera was ready.  Gilbert again proposed a version of the "lozenge" plot for their next opera, and Sullivan reiterated his desire to leave the partnership.  While the two men worked out their artistic differences, Carte produced revivals of such old favourites as ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and ''[[The Mikado]]''.

;''The Yeomen of the Guard''
[[Image:Denny and Bond.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[W.H. Denny]] as Wilfred and [[Jessie Bond]] as Phoebe in ''Yeomen'']]''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888), their only joint work with a serious ending, concerns a pair of strolling players—a jester and a singing girl—who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the [[Tower of London]] during the 16th century.  The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-[[William Shakespeare|Shakespearian]], or [[Early Modern English|early modern English]], in style, and there is no satire of British institutions.  For some of the plot elements, Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy, ''[[Broken Hearts]]''.  ''The Times'' praised the libretto: "It should... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things."<ref>[http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~melbear/yeomen.htm Quoted at the Australian G&S website.]</ref>  Although not a grand opera, the new libretto provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious score to date.  The critics, who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio, ''[[The Golden Legend (oratorio)|The Golden Legend]]'', considered the score to ''Yeomen'' to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, which was written in [[sonata form]], rather than as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of his other overtures.  The ''Daily Telegraph'' wrote:
{{cquote|The accompaniments...are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention.  Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly....  We place the songs and choruses in ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera....<ref>Quoted in Allen 1975, p. 312</ref>}}

''Yeomen'' was a hit, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions.  During the run, on 12 March 1889, Sullivan wrote to Gilbert, {{cquote|I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it....  You say that in a serious opera, ''you'' must more or less sacrifice yourself.  I say that this is just what I have been doing in all our joint pieces, and, what is more, must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful.<ref>Jacobs, p. 283</ref>}}  Sullivan insisted that the next opera must be a [[grand opera]].  Gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted.  The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'') for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera.  After a brief impasse over the choice of subject, Sullivan accepted an idea connected with [[Venice]] and Venetian life, as "this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music."<ref>Jacobs, p. 288</ref>

;''The Gondoliers''
[[Image:Marco and Giuseppe.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Rutland Barrington|Barrington]] and [[Courtice Pounds|Pounds]] as Giuseppe and Marco in ''The Gondoliers'']]''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889) takes place partly in Venice and partly in a kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of "republican equality."<ref>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gondoliers/html/index.html ''The Gondoliers'' at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive],  Retrieved on [[2007-07-21]].</ref>  Gilbert recapitulates a number of his earlier themes, including the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos.  The libretto also reflects Gilbert's fascination with the "Stock Company Act", highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities, which plays an even larger part in the next opera, ''Utopia Limited''.  Press accounts were almost entirely favourable.  The ''Illustrated London News'' reported:
{{cquote|...Gilbert has returned to the Gilbert of the past, and everyone is delighted. He is himself again. The Gilbert of ''The [[Bab Ballads]]'', the Gilbert of whimsical conceit, inoffensive cynicism, subtle satire, and playful paradox; the Gilbert who invented a school of his own, who in it was schoolmaster and pupil, who has never taught anybody but himself, and is never likely to have any imitator&mdash;this is the Gilbert the public want to see, and this is the Gilbert who on Saturday night was cheered till the audience was weary of cheering any more.<ref>Baily, p. 344</ref>}}

Sullivan's old collaborator on ''[[Cox and Box]]'' (later the editor of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine), [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]], wrote to the composer: "Magnificento!...I envy you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion."<ref>Baily, p. 344</ref>  The opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There was a command performance of ''The Gondoliers'' for [[Queen Victoria]] and the royal family at [[Windsor Castle]] in 1891, the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured.  ''The Gondoliers'' was Gilbert and Sullivan's last great success.

===The carpet quarrel===
[[Image:1881 Savoy Theatre.jpg|right|thumb|200px|right|[[Savoy Theatre]] c.1881]]
Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two—Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict.<ref>See, e.g., Stedman, pp. 254-56 and 323-24 and Ainger, pp. 193-94.</ref>   In addition, Gilbert imbued his [[libretto|libretti]] with "topsy-turvy" situations in which the social order was turned upside down.  After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.<ref>See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3</ref>  Also, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage.<ref>See, e.g. Jacobs, p. 73; Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html The Life of W.S. Gilbert.] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]]; and Bond, Jessie, [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/bond/chapter16_txt.htm The Reminiscences of Jessie Bond: Chapter 16.] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]]</ref>

Gilbert and Sullivan quarrelled several times over the choice of a subject.  After both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore'', which were less successful than the seven other operas from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' to ''The Gondoliers'', Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him.  While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works.  On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.<ref name=Carpet/>

During the run of ''The Gondoliers'', however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:
{{cquote|After all, the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May, 1891, a year after the end of the "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone.<ref name=Carpet/>}}

Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building a theatre in London for the production of new English grand operas, with Sullivan's ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' as the inaugural work. While the protracted quarrel worked itself out in the courts and in public, Gilbert wrote ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'' with [[Alfred Cellier]] and the flop ''[[Haste to the Wedding]]'' with [[George Grossmith]],<ref name=PlayList>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/html/other_gilbert.html Gilbert's Plays.] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref> and Sullivan also wrote ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' with Sidney Grundy.

In 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair and their producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, [[William Chappell|Tom Chappell]], stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded.<ref>Wolfson, p. 7</ref>

===Last works and legacy===
[[Image:Utopia Limited Poster.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The drawing room scene from Act II of ''Utopia'']]
[[Image:Glad_to_See_You_Together.png|thumb|300px|left|The ''Entr'acte'' expresses its pleasure that Gilbert and Sullivan are reunited.]]
''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896) was an outright failure.<ref>Wolfson, passim</ref> Neither work entered the "canon" of regularly-performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert also offered Sullivan ''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'' (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting [[Nancy McIntosh]], his protégée from ''Utopia'', led to Sullivan's refusal, and it was instead composed by [[F. Osmond Carr]].<ref> Wolfson, pp. 61-65</ref>

After ''The Grand Duke'', the partners saw no reason to work together again. Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died four years later, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully with [[Basil Hood]] in ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), and ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901) (finished by [[Edward German]] after Sullivan's death).  By the time of Sullivan's death, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been "completely bridged over," and "the most cordial relations existed between us."  He stated that Sullivan was ''"A composer of the rarest genius — who, because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is....  I remember all that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name."''<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/chap18.html Walbrook, Chapter 18]</ref>  Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. He wrote only one more comic opera, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' ([[1909]]; music by [[Edward German]]), which was not a success.<ref>Bailey, p. 425</ref>  [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] died in 1901, and his widow, [[Helen Carte|Helen]], and then his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], followed by his granddaughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte|Bridget]], continued to direct the activities of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which staged revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas until it closed in 1982.  

[[Image:Comic Opera at the Savoy.png|thumb|right|300px|"Good times will come again" – [[George Grossmith]] attempts to cheer up [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] after the failure of ''[[The Grand Duke]]''. ]]Sir [[Henry Wood]] explained the enduring success of the collaboration as follows:
{{cquote|...Sullivan has never had an equal for brightness and drollery, for humour without coarseness and without vulgarity, and for charm and grace. His orchestration is delightful: he wrote with full understanding of every orchestral voice. Above all, his music is perfectly appropriate to the words of which it is the setting.... He found the right, the only cadences to fit Gilbert's happy and original rhythms, and to match Gilbert's fun or to throw Gilbert's frequent irony, pointed although not savage, into relief. Sullivan's music is much more than the accompaniment of Gilbert's libretti, just as Gilbert's libretti are far more than words to Sullivan's music. We have two masters who are playing a concerto. Neither is subordinate to the other; each gives what is original, but the two, while neither predominates, are in perfect correspondence. This rare harmony of words and music is what makes these operas entirely unique. They are the work not of a musician and his librettist nor of a poet and one who sets his words to music, but of two geniuses.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/foreword.html Sir [[Henry Wood]]'s foreword to Walbrook]</ref>}}

Because of the unusual success of the operas, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company were<!--British usage--> able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the [[J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company]], and to amateur societies.  For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired in 1961, and even afterwards, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide, creating a "performing tradition" for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors.  D'Oyly Carte produced several well-regarded recordings of most of the operas, helping to keep them popular through the decades.

Today, numerous professional repertory companies,<ref>For example, [[NYGASP]], [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]], Somerset Opera, [[Opera della Luna]], [[Opera a la Carte]], [[Skylight opera theatre]], [[Ohio Light Opera]], and [[Washington Savoyards]]</ref> opera companies, amateur societies, churches, schools and universities continue to produce the works.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html Websites of Performing Groups.] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]]</ref> The most popular G&S works are still performed from time to time by major opera companies,<ref>[http://www.operabase.com/oplist.cgi?id=none&lang=en&is=&by=Sullivan&loc=&stype=abs&sd=30&sm=10&sy=2005&etype=abs&ed=31&em=10&ey=2007 Performances, by city&mdash;Composer: Arthur Sullivan.] operabase.com, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]]</ref>  A three-week long [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]] is held every August in [[Buxton|Buxton, England]].

{{cquote|I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them, my nurse, Emma, breathed them through her teeth while she was washing me, dressing me and undressing me and putting me to bed. My aunts and uncles, who were legion, sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation....<ref>''The Noel Coward Song Book'', (London: Methuen, 1953), p. 9</ref>

Gilbert and Sullivan's work provides a rich cultural resource outside of their influence upon musicals. The works of Gilbert and Sullivan are themselves frequently pastiched.<ref>[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/miscderv.htm List of links to reviews and analysis of recordings of a number of G&S parodies]</ref>  Well known examples of this include [[Tom Lehrer]]'s [[The Elements (song)|The Elements]],<ref>[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/mdlehrer.htm Review and analysis of Lehrer's G&S parodies]</ref> [[Allan Sherman]]'s, [[The Two Ronnies]]<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Ronnies-Complete-Christmas-Specials/dp/B000VA3J6G The Two Ronnies's G&S parody is in their 1973 Christmas special]</ref> and [[Anna Russell]]'s famous routines,<ref>[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/mdanna.htm Review and analysis of Russell's G&S parody]</ref> and the animated TV series, ''[[Animaniacs]]''' ''HMS Yakko'' episode.  Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature, film and television in various ways that include extensive use of Sullivan's music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera.  There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biopics, such as [[Mike Leigh]]'s ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]''.
{{cquote|The musical is not, of course, the only cultural form to show the influence of G&S.  Even more direct heirs are those witty and satirical songwriters found on both sides of the Atlantic in the twentieth century like [[Michael Flanders]] and [[Donald Swann]] in the United Kingdom and [[Tom Lehrer]] in the United States.  The influrence of Gilbert is discernible in a vein of British comedy that runs through [[John Betjeman]]'s verse via [[Monty Python]] and [[Private Eye]] to... television series like ''Yes, Minister''... where the emphasis is on wit, irony, and poking fun at the establishment from within it in a way which manages to be both disrespectful of authority and yet cosily comfortable and urbane.| [[Ian Bradley]]|(2005)}}

It is not surprising, given the focus of Gilbert on politics, that politicians and political observers have often found inspiration in these works.  U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William Rehnquist]] added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the [[Lord Chancellor]] in a production of [[Iolanthe]].<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=353263 "Sporting stripes set Rehnquist apart".] Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Online, [[September 4]] [[2005]].  Retrieved on [[2007-05-26]].</ref> Alternatively, [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Chancellor Charles Falconer]] is recorded as objecting so strongly to Iolanthe's comic portrayal of Lord Chancellors that he supported moves to disband the office.<ref name="Green" /> British politicians, beyond quoting some of the more famous lines, have delivered speeches in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches.  These include Conservative [[Peter Lilley]]'s speech mimicking the form of "I've got a little list" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', listing those he was against, including "sponging socialists" and "young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue".<ref name="Green" />  Political humour based on Gilbert and Sullivan's style and characters continues to be written.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/columnists/columnists.html?in_article_id=465034&in_page_id=1772&in_author_id=322&in_check=N this ''Daily Mail'' editorial piece, dated June 29, 2007]</ref>

== Alternative versions ==
;Translations
Gilbert and Sullivan operas have been translated into many languages, including Portuguese, Yiddish, Hebrew, Swedish, Danish, Estonian, Spanish (reportedly including a version of ''Pinafore'' transformed into [[zarzuela]] style), and many others.  

There are many German versions of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the popular ''Der Mikado''.  There is even a German version of ''The Grand Duke''.  Some German translations were made by Friedrich Zell and Richard Genée, librettists of ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', ''[[Eine Nacht in Venedig]]'' and other Viennese operettas, who even translated one of  Sullivan's  lesser-known operas, ''[[The Chieftain]]'', as ''("Der Häuptling").''
