'''Pauline Fowler''' (née '''Beale''') was a [[fictional character]] in the popular [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played continuously by actress [[Wendy Richard]]<ref name="gone">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5165860.stm|title=Wendy Richard to leave EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]]|date=[[10 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> from the show's first episode on [[19 February]] [[1985]] and remaining on-screen for almost twenty-two years. She is the second longest-running character in the show's history, surpassed only by [[Adam Woodyatt]]'s character, [[Ian Beale]]. 

Storylines in ''EastEnders'' are often major news events in the UK, and Pauline's troubles were frequently the subject of newspaper headlines, television documentaries, behind-the-scenes books and fictional tie-in novels. Crises in her life were often aired on major holidays such as [[Boxing Day]], [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Day]], as the audience share for ''EastEnders'' is typically higher at these times.
 
Pauline was the matriarchal stalwart of the fictional London community of [[Albert Square]]. Quintessentially working-class, she had a life of drudgery, money worries and family troubles, but soldiered on through it all with typical stoicism. Fiercely loyal to her family, she inherited her acid tongue from her mother, [[Lou Beale]], and was never afraid to speak her mind or defend her views. However, the family that she held so dear dwindled in the latter years of her life, partly due to her overbearing ways. Her most consistent job was working as an assistant at Walford's [[List of buildings in EastEnders#Launderette|launderette]]; a job she kept until her death in 2006. Over the years she also worked part-time as a cleaner and a barmaid at [[The Queen Vic]], at Tate's Paint Factory and in 1991 she became part owner of the Bridge Street café with [[Kathy Beale]] and [[Frank Butcher]].<ref name="first10years"/> Her most enduring friendship was with her fellow launderette colleague, [[Dot Branning|Dot Cotton]]. Her arch-enemy was [[Den Watts]]; a family-friend who got her daughter Michelle pregnant at just 16. Although viewed as a battleaxe, Pauline was never one to neglect her [[Christianity|Christian]] duties and housed many waifs and strays over the years, including her [[Cairn Terrier]] [[List of pets in EastEnders#Dogs|Betty]], who became her inseparable sidekick.

Her final appearance was a death scene, dying from what was later revealed to be a blow to the head, in the middle of the Albert Square gardens on Christmas Day, [[25 December]] [[2006]]. The episode was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news |title= Vicar of Dibley tops Christmas TV viewing|url= http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=1915232006|publisher= ''[[The Scotsman]]''|date=[[26 December]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2006-12-27 }}</ref>

== Character creation and development ==
===Background===
Pauline Fowler was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Holland had drawn on his own London background for inspiration, naming some of the characters after his cousins, the fraternal twins Pete and Pauline and their mother Lou; a family set-up recreated on-screen as the first family of ''EastEnders'', [[The Beale/Fowler family|the Beales and Fowlers]].<ref name="insidestory">{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|id=ISBN 0-563-20601-2}}</ref>

Pauline's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''.

:"[[Pete Beale|Pete]]'s twin sister. Forty, and a chip off the [[Lou Beale]] block. Plucky, and determined to battle through whatever the odds. A warm, practical, unsophisticated woman: you stand by your man, do your duty, fight for your kids and have a roast for [[Sunday dinner]]...She's also pregnant...She actually remembers her dad saying ''"Two things we don't discuss in this house are religion and politics".'' She also remembers her dad smoked a pipe, and wishes her husband did too. She loved her dad very much... Maybe she didn't go into her marriage with quite the right spirit? She was due to be chief bridesmaid at her sister's wedding but she'd got [[influenza|the flu]] and was confined to bed. Arthur, someone she'd known from school, was given permission to visit the invalid upstairs. He found himself proposing to her. Years later he said ''"It was to cheer her up really."'' And Pauline found herself accepting too...She's very fond of her twin brother, Pete (and knows that he's mum's favourite). She's very conventional, and the salt of the earth. Jolly, rounded, someone you can get your arms round. She doesn't trust skinny people..." (page 54).<ref name="insidestory"/>

===Casting===
[[Image:PAULINE333.jpg|right|thumb|160px|An early image of Pauline, taken from the second episode of the soap (1985).]]
From the beginning, Smith had considered the role would be ideal for the actress [[Wendy Richard]], even though their casting policy was not to use 'stars' and Richard was already a household name in the UK. Up until this time, Richard was known for playing glamorous roles, such as her role as [[List of Are You Being Served? characters#Miss Shirley Brahms|Shirley Brahms]] in the successful sitcom ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' Smith initially feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age. She was subsequently offered the role.<ref name="insidestory"/> 

Richard's casting was considered to be "a giant leap of faith" by Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately "landed on its feet",<ref name="insidestory"/> because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in the ''EastEnders''' history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.

===Narrative, impact and progression===
Pauline's early memorable storylines included giving birth at the age of 41 to her son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]], a feud with lothario [[Den Watts]], as well as having to contend with a plethora of family and money problems. Pauline's marriage to the luckless [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] was central to the character and they have been hailed as "the soap's most famous husband and wife team."<ref name="feud">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960512/ai_n14451573|title=WENDY NEVER INVITED ME TO HER WEDDING|publisher=''[[Sunday Mirror]]''|date=[[12 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> 

The dynamics of Pauline and Arthur's relationship were clear from the beginning of the programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that held the Fowler family together, while Arthur was depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer [[Jacquetta May]], who once played [[Rachel Kominski]] in the programme, has commented that Pauline and Arthur "represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man...Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved like a little boy while Pauline had to make the decisions and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression."<ref>"{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|title= Square deal|publisher=redpepper.org|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> 

Over the years Pauline's character altered somewhat from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the 1980s, she became somewhat of a sombre battleaxe, hardened by a life of misery in [[Albert Square]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/eastenders/Eastenders+Pauline+Fowler+to+be+Killed+off+at+Christmas-20368.html|title=Eastenders Pauline Fowler to be Killed off at Christmas|publisher=Femalefirst.co.uk|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> This change in Pauline's character can perhaps be traced back to the [[adultery|infidelity]] of her husband with lonely divorcée [[Christine Hewitt]] in 1993.<ref name="first10years">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2}}</ref> 

The audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, but they were generally seen as the most stable of all couples ever featured in the show, so the storyline involving Arthur's extra-marital affair came as a huge shock to viewers.<ref name="first10years"/> The British press labelled the storyline "The Bonk of the Year" and it finally reached its climax on-screen in September 1993.<ref name="first10years"/> The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would find out about the affair; should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?<ref name="first10years"/> In the end it was felt that Arthur should decide to tell her himself, which he did in a shocking episode that saw Pauline turn violent and hit Arthur in the face with a frying pan. This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: the first ten years]]''.<ref name="first10years"/>

For a while it seemed that ''EastEnders''' "most solid" marriage was over,<ref name="first10years"/> but Arthur spent the rest of 1993 trying to convince Pauline that it was worth saving and they eventually reconciled.<ref name="first10years"/> However, more tragedy was to follow when Arthur was framed by conman, [[Willy Roper]] (dubbed "Wicked Willy" by the British press),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960505/ai_n14451770|title=WICKED WILLY AND HIS FRIEND CARRY ON UP THE NILE|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[5 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> and wrongfully imprisoned for embezzlement in 1995. The storyline captured the public's imagination and a nationwide "Free Arthur Fowler" campaign was launched — "Arthur Fowler Is Innocent" T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the [[UK singles chart]] promoting the campaign.<ref name="Treacher">{{cite web|url=http://billtreacherwebsite.tripod.com/page2.htm|title=Bill Treacher - Eastenders|accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref> 

Arthur's imprisonment was actually a precursor to the final exit of actor [[Bill Treacher]], who decided to leave ''EastEnders'' after 11 years playing Arthur.<ref name="Dartagnan">{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,5-2002290611,00.html|title=D'Arthur to D'Artagnan|publisher=''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''|accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref> While Arthur went to pieces in prison, Pauline was heavily embroiled in the storyline pertaining to his eventual release. For several months viewers witnessed Willy attempt to woo Pauline, but she eventually uncovered his deception and then resorted to uncharacteristic [[seduction]] to gain his confession.<ref name="confess">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19960512/ai_n14451377|title=Pauline's one jumper ahead|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[12 May]] [[1996]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> One critic commented "Pauline Fowler deserves a Golden Cardie Award for her performance in EastEnders. The way which she extracted a confession from Willy Roper over the money he stole was nothing short of brilliant."<ref name="confess"/> Arthur was released, but his joyful reunion with Pauline was brief, as an injury he sustained in prison led to a [[brain haemorrhage]] and he died shortly after his release. His death ended an 11 year screen marriage, the serial's most enduring to date.<ref name="feud"/> 

The character of Pauline went on to feature in many other memorable storylines including various feuds, her son's fatal battle with [[HIV]], a battle for the custody of her youngest son's child and towards the end, re-marrying after almost a decade alone. 

In July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she would be leaving the show. She said she made the decision to leave when the producers of ''EastEnders'' revealed that Pauline was to re-marry. Richard thought it was "disloyal" of Pauline to her beloved first husband Arthur. Pauline married [[Joe Macer]] (played by [[Ray Brooks]]) in February 2006 and Richard since commented: "I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong." <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006360264,00.html|title=Wendy: Why I quit Enders|publisher=''The Sun''|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>
[[Image:Pauline1985.jpg|left|thumb|180px|A heavily pregnant Pauline Fowler in July 1985.]]
The character was killed off in a shocking and dramatic storyline, which aired on Christmas Day 2006. The episode was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers and was the second most highly watched programme of the day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=424848&in_page_id=1773|title=BBC1 posts its worst Christmas Day ratings ever|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=[[26 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline brooded in the burnt-out shell of her house while the voices of her (mainly deceased) family echoed like ghosts around her. Her bitter decline had involved pretending to have a [[brain tumour]] to scupper the revived relationship between her son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] and his ex-wife [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]]. When Pauline’s lie was uncovered, Martin and the rest of Albert Square turned against her. However, after a Christmas heart-to-heart with nemesis Sonia, Pauline decided to rebuild her broken family and make amends with Martin. However, in a tragic final twist, Pauline collapsed beneath the Square’s Christmas tree before she could make peace with her loved ones. Her untimely demise left the rest of Walford in uncertainty about what caused her death. The repurcussions of the events of [[Christmas Day]] shook the Square in early 2007, when Sonia was arrested for the murder, although Pauline's husband Joe was later revealed to have struck the fatal blow.<ref name="LIFE STYLE EXTRA">{{cite news|url=http://www.lse.co.uk/TVNews.asp?Code=XV36477P&headline=sonia_issued_warrant_for_paulines_murder|title=Sonia issued warrant for Pauline's murder|publisher=''Life Style Extra''|date=[[2007-01-03]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>

The Christmas Day episodes, written by [[Simon Ashdown]], drew on the show’s early history to mark the occasion of Pauline's exit, which was particularly felt by the use of flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family.<ref name="times"/> The critic for ''[[The Times]]'' online, Tim Teeman, has commented that "Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl."<ref name="times"/> In addition, her parting scene with the other ''EastEnders'' long-serving "grand dame" [[Dot Branning]] (played by [[June Brown]]) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: "The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved."<ref name="times"/> 

Richard herself has been less complimentary about her alter ego's departure and has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's "changing character" and "depressing final storyline". In an interview with the [[The Biography Channel|Biography Channel]] she explained: "I did say, promise me you won’t make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did... I wasn’t too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline’s character... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That’s what [show creator] Julia Smith wanted, and that’s what I felt was right, so I resigned... I think it’s a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now... There was so much history with that family."<ref name="DSdisappointed">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds41025.html|title=Richard disappointed by 'Enders exit|publisher=''[[Digital Spy]]''|date=[[23 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> 

As a final tribute to Pauline and Wendy Richard the BBC aired a special television programme entitled ''[[EastEnders Revealed]]: Goodbye Pauline'', which provided an emotional look back at Richard's time in Walford, reunited her with prior cast-mates, [[Todd Carty]] and [[James Alexandrou]] (Mark and Martin respectively) and also featured tributes from [[Anna Wing]] and [[Pam St. Clement]] (Lou and [[Pat Evans|Pat]]) among others.<ref name="EErevealed">{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/display.var.1097748.0.eastenders_revealed_goodbye_pauline_bbc1.php|title=EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, BBC1|publisher=''This Is Lancashire''|date=[[2 January]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> The programme aired on [[New Year's Day]], 2007.

==Pre-serial life==
At the beginning of the ''EastEnders'' serial in 1985, Pauline is 41 years old, already married with two grown children.  The story of her younger years is told via behind-the-scenes books such as ''EastEnders: The Inside Story'', and also the second tie-in novel by [[Hugh Miller (writer)|Hugh Miller]], ''Swings and Roundabouts.''  Through these books, it is revealed that Pauline had been born at [[list of residences in EastEnders#45 Alber Square|number 45]] [[Albert Square]], and thus lived there her entire life. She was delivered by [[Dr. Harold Legg]], and is the youngest daughter of [[Albert Beale|Albert]] and [[Lou Beale]].  Pauline is extremely close to her [[twin]] brother, [[Pete Beale|Pete]], and dearly loved her father, but he died when she was 12 years old, causing her to have to grow up quickly. She dates a sleazy salesman named Gerry Carter, who tries to take her virginity in the back of his car but she fends him off by stabbing him in the arm with a hatpin. 

At the age of 20, she is meant to be a [[bridesmaid]] at the wedding of her sister, Dora.  However, she is ill with the flu and cannot go.  Her boyfriend, [[Arthur Fowler]], proposes to her while she is ill, later explaining that he'd done it "to cheer her up". They marry in September 1965 and within four years she has given birth to two children, [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] in 1968 and [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite book |last=Miller |first= Hugh|authorlink= Hugh Miller (writer)|title=[[EastEnders books#Novels|EastEnders - Book Two: Swings and Roundabouts]] |year=1986|publisher=Inner Circle Books|id=ISBN 1-85018-050-4}}</ref>

==In-serial storylines==
===Early years===
[[Image:PAUL LOU.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Pauline stands up to her mother in the first episode of the programme (February 1985).]]
When ''EastEnders'' begins, Pauline is a working wife and mother with two teenage children, and another on the way. Her husband, Arthur, has been made [[redundancy (law)|redundant]] in 1984 and at age 43, he has no prospects for steady employment, so Pauline's unexpected pregnancy comes at a very bad time. Pauline's mother Lou tells her that she cannot afford another child and orders her to "[[abortion|get rid of it]]", but Pauline stands up to her mother for the first time in her life, and decides to keep the child. Apart from [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]]'s birth in July 1985, the following few years are not happy ones for Pauline.<ref name="EEHandbook">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 978-0685529577}}</ref> She has to contend with her deviant son Mark, her daughter Michelle's teenage pregnancy to a mystery man, and the [[mental breakdown]] and imprisonment of Arthur, who is caught stealing the Walford residents' Christmas club money, leaving Pauline struggling to repay the debt.<ref name="first10years"/> 
[[Image:Pauline Den prison.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Pauline visits Den in prison and forces a deal (1988).]]
In 1987, Pauline witnesses [[Den Watts]] trying to give Michelle money, and correctly guesses that he is the father of her daughter, [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]].<ref name="EEHandbook"/> This launches a feud between Pauline and Den that lasts for the remainder of Den's life. She spends most of her time trying to dig up incriminating evidence so she can force him to leave Walford and tells Michelle to keep Den away from Vicki, or she will inform everybody about the secret.

Following Lou's death in 1988, Pauline promptly takes over as the family matriarch. She is thrilled when Den is imprisoned on [[remand]] later in the year. However her ire rises once again when she discovers that Den has been sending Michelle and Vicki Christmas presents from prison. She threatens to inform his daughter, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]], that he is Vicki's father unless he keeps away from her family.<ref name="xmas88">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19881222.shtml|title=Xmas 88 - Den in prison|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2006-11-08}}</ref> She is finally rid of Den when he is shot and presumed dead in February 1989.

In July 1989 Pauline begins to go through some poor health. Fearing that she might need a serious [[gynaecology|gynaecological]] operation, Pauline refuses medical assistance and is forced to hand in her notice at the launderette due to chronic tiredness. However, in September, she is hit by [[Ricky Butcher]]'s car, causing her to be hospitalised with a cracked rib.<ref name="first10years"/> The accident proves to be a blessing in disguise as the examination brings news that she is suffering with [[fibroids]]. She is forced to spend Christmas in hospital recovering from a [[hysterectomy]].<ref name="EEHandbook"/>

===Pauline's heartache===
Pauline is overjoyed when her son Mark returns home in 1990 after nearly five years away. However she begins to worry that something is wrong when she discovers mysterious helpline cards in his clothes and notices how irrational he gets whenever he bleeds. On [[Boxing Day]] 1991 Mark finally decides to tell his parents that he is [[HIV positive people|HIV positive]].<ref name="xmas91">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19911226.shtml|title=Grant and Sharon get hitched|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> Pauline is distraught, but after a difficult period she comes to accept Mark's condition.<ref name="20years">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-52269-0}}</ref>
[[Image:PAUL ARTHIV.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pauline and Arthur are stunned by Mark's confession (1991).]]
In 1992, Arthur takes up a new occupation as a gardener, most notably for the lonely divorcée [[Christine Hewitt]]. In May, Pauline learns that her brother [[Kenny Beale]] has been in a car crash in [[New Zealand]], and she decides to visit him (in fact, Wendy Richard had to be written out of the series to allow her time to act in ''[[Grace and Favour]]'').<ref name="first10years"/> While she is away, Christine grows extremely close to Arthur and she eventually makes a pass at him. Although he is tempted, he turns her down and she then disappears, sending him a letter explaining her feelings, which is discovered by Pauline on her return. Pauline goes to see Christine to discover the truth, and finds her to be a lonely figure who drinks too much. Pauline is persuaded to forgive Arthur, but he cannot keep away from Christine and on Christmas Eve 1992 they sleep together.<ref name="20years"/>

Throughout 1993 Christine begins to make greater demands on Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair. Arthur begins to realise that he has made a mistake. In September, under duress, Arthur decides to inform Pauline about his infidelity and tries to tell her that he wants her and not Christine. Hurt, embarrassed and angry, Pauline responds by hitting Arthur around the head with a frying pan and then throws him out of their home.<ref name="20years"/> Arthur spends the rest of the year trying to make up with her, and they eventually reconcile when he helps her deal with the death of her brother Pete in December 1993. They slowly begin to rebuild their marriage, although the affair is never allowed to be forgotten.<ref name="first10years"/>

===Arthur's demise===
In 1995 Arthur is elected secretary of the [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] committee. He starts raising money to create a new urban garden and by the end of the year he manages to raise [[pound sterling|£]]20,000.<ref name="20years"/>
[[Image:Pauline Arthur EastEnders.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Pauline collects Arthur from prison in 1996, days before his death.]]
Arthur's friend, [[Willy Roper]], takes a keen interest in the financial dealings, and cons Arthur into signing the fund money into various different accounts, then leaves him to face the consequences when the money is declared missing. For a second time, Arthur is imprisoned. Upon this, Arthur suffers a mental breakdown and refuses contact with Pauline.<ref name="20years"/> Willy then spends the beginning of 1996 trying to woo Pauline, despite the objections of her family.<ref name="20years"/> 

In April 1996, Willy asks Pauline to go to [[Jersey]] on holiday — his real motive is to put the stolen money in an off-shore account under a false name. While travelling, Pauline and Willy become very close, but this changes when she discovers his [[counterfeit]] credit cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walford.net/update/19960430.htm|title=''EastEnders'' TUE 30-APR-96 episode description|publisher=Walford.net|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Back in Walford, she eventually manages to make him confess to [[embezzlement]] and [[frameup|framing]] Arthur, and Willy is arrested and charged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walford.net/update/19960509.htm|title=''EastEnders'' THU 09-MAY-96 episode description|publisher=Walford.net|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> [[Image:Arthursbench.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The plaque from "Arthur's bench", which is placed in the Albert Square gardens in 1996 after his death. In 2006, Pauline collapses and dies near the same bench. The inscription on the plaque reads, "Arthur Fowler: He loved this place."]]Arthur is cleared, but the day before his release he is involved in a prison riot and receives a blow to the head. Only a few days after his release in May 1996, Arthur suffers a [[brain haemorrhage]] on the [[allotment]]s, and dies the next day in hospital.<ref name="20years"/> His funeral is delayed pending an inquest, but the jury returns a verdict of accidental death, much to the disgust of Pauline, who feels that the prison services neglected to seek proper medical help for Arthur.<ref name="20years"/> A bench is placed in dedication to his memory in the Albert Square gardens.

===Family issues===
Following Arthur's death, Pauline engrosses herself in her family, seeing it as her duty to keep it together. She is a traditionalist, with strict rules and beliefs, and although she is the first to criticise, she fully defends her children, often interfering in their issues and causing rifts in their relationships. She is particularly hostile to the women who feature in her sons' lives, coming to epitomise the archetypal mother-in-law. 

When Pauline discovers in 2001 that Martin is the father of [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]]'s baby, [[Rebecca Miller (EastEnders)|Chloe]], she is determined to raise the child. Sonia is opposed to this and decides to put Chloe up for adoption instead. Pauline threatens to take Sonia to court for custody, but is forced to back down when Martin admits that he does not want to be a father.<ref name="20years"/>
 
She is opposed to Mark's union with [[Lisa Fowler|Lisa Shaw]], especially when she discovers that they are lying about Mark being the father of Lisa's baby, [[Louise Mitchell|Louise]], in order to fool the real father, [[Phil Mitchell]]. In 2002 Pauline receives an anonymous letter informing her of Lisa and Phil's renewed affair and becomes determined to split her and Mark up.<ref name="20years"/>

[[Image:Pauline Funeral.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Pauline grieves at the funeral for her son, Mark, who dies of [[AIDS]] in 2004.]]
Pauline's overbearing ways only serve to alienate Martin, and she cannot curtail his deviance. She begins to rely on Mark more than ever, but when he discovers that his [[HIV]] medication is failing, he can no longer cope with her dependence and refuses to let her witness his deterioration.

===Second marriage===
[[Image:Pauline&Joe.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Pauline and Joe marry, [[17 February]] [[2006]].]]
Several eligible bachelors express their interest in Pauline over the years, including [[Derek Taylor (EastEnders)|Derek Taylor]], [[Danny Taurus]], [[Jeff Healy (EastEnders)|Jeff Healy]] (who proposes), [[Eddie Skinner]], and [[Terry Raymond]], who she goes on a blind date with.<ref name="22 May 2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20010522.shtml#3|title=Episode guide - 22 May 2001|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> However, Pauline remains staunchly faithful to her late husband's memory and refuses to let the relationships progress beyond companionship. In 2001 it looks as if Pauline is finally willing to begin a new relationship with her childhood friend, [[Derek Harkinson]], however he stuns her by confessing that he is [[homosexuality|gay]].<ref name="18 Dec 2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20011218.shtml#4|title=Episode guide - 18 Dec 2001|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>  

In August 2005 however, Pauline grows close to [[Joe Macer]], whom she meets at a [[salsa dance]] class. Although Joe is obviously drawn to Pauline, he is kept at bay by Pauline's unwillingness to betray Arthur's memory. Pauline eventually allows him to get closer and it is not long before he falls in love and proposes to her in a crowded [[Queen Vic]]. She declines but Joe asks her again in February 2006 after telling her that he will leave to live in [[Dubai]] unless she commits to their relationship; this time she accepts,<ref name="Mon 06 Feb 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20060206.shtml|title=Episode guide - Mon 06 Feb 2006|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> and despite her misgivings, they marry on [[17 February]] [[2006]]. Pauline chooses to keep her surname as Fowler since she feels that she has lived most of her life with the name and does not want a 'new identity'.<ref name="Fri 17 Feb 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20060217.shtml|title=Episode guide - Fri 17 Feb 2006 - Pauline's wedding day|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

===Deception, reclusiveness and death===
In November 2006, Martin and Pauline argue about Pauline's treatment of Sonia, and Pauline becomes depressed to learn they have reunited. When a fire starts at her house, she does nothing to stop it and awaits her death, until Martin rescues her. Whilst in hospital, she concocts a story about having a brain tumour, in order to regain Martin's attention and split him and Sonia up. The community initially rallies around her, until Joe uncovers the deception, and the community turn against her. Still unfazed, Pauline decides to exert her revenge on her son by cutting him out of her life. She informs him that she is taking back the family's fruit and veg stall, cutting off his only source of income.<ref name="Thu 21 Dec 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20061221.shtml|title=Episode guide - Thu 21 Dec 2006|ublisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

Joe tries to get through to Pauline, but she is hostile. She compares him unfavorably to Arthur and confesses that she hads never really loved him. She ridicules their lacklustre sex life and tells him their marriage is over. Furious, Joe begins smashing up her living room and insulting her family. Pauline retaliates by smashing a plate over his head<ref name="Thu 21 Dec 2006"/> and then makes plans to leave Walford to live with Michelle in America.

[[Image:Sonia slaps pauline.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Sonia hits Pauline, Christmas Day 2006.]]
On Christmas Day 2006, Sonia informs Pauline that she and Martin are remarrying. A heated argument ensues, which culminates in Pauline being slapped in the face by Sonia. Despite Sonia's apologies, Pauline is still adamant that she is leaving Walford. However, when she discovers a Christmas card from Rebecca, she begins to realise what she is giving up. She goes to tell Martin she is staying, but as she walks, she staggers and frequently clutches her head in obvious pain. Suddenly, she collapses in the middle of Albert Square gardens near Arthur's bench and lays motionless in the snow. A short time later she is found, and Martin is horrified to discover that she is dead.

Pauline's funeral takes place on [[1 January]] [[2007]], however the proceedings are halted due to Dot, who calls the police after Rebecca confesses to seeing Sonia hit Pauline.<ref name="Tue 02 Jan 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20070102.shtml|title=Episode guide - Tue 02 Jan 2007 - Pauline's funeral|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> The police interrupt the funeral to take Pauline's body away for an autopsy, which confirms that she died of a [[brain haemorrhage]], caused by a blow to the head.<ref name="Mon 01 Jan 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20070101_n2.shtml|title=Episode guide - Mon 01 Jan 2007 - Sonia feels cornered|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>  

Sonia is arrested for Pauline's murder, but it turns out that her death has been caused by her husband Joe. He breaks down and confesses to Dot that he had argued with Pauline on Christmas day and, in a fury, he had struck her across the head with a frying pan, causing the brain haemorrhage that claimed her life. Dot is appalled and as she tries to leave, Joe attempts to apprehend her. The resulting scuffle causes Joe to lose his footing and fall out of the Fowlers' first floor window, to his death. Sonia is cleared, and Pauline's body is [[cremation|cremated]] on [[29 January]] [[2007]]. Her ashes are kept at number 45, but when Ian moves in, his children, [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] and [[Peter Beale|Peter]], become convinced that Pauline is haunting them, so they are now kept at the launderette by Dot.

==Reception==
===Popularity===
Pauline is the second-longest running character to feature in ''EastEnders'' and one of only two original characters to remain in the show for almost 22 years. Her baggy woolly cardigan and long-suffering nature have led to her being labelled as a soap institution,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1044603.stm|title=EastEnder Pauline's Palace date|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=[[28 November]] [[2000]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> a "soap legend" and a "television icon".<ref name="stage">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/07/a_raven_leaves_the_tower_walford_style.php|title=A raven leaves the tower - Walford style|publisher=''[[The Stage]]''|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> 

When Richard announced her depature from the show in 2006, BBC controller of continuing drama [[John Yorke]] commented "Richard occupies a huge place in people's hearts" <ref name="gone"/> and executive producer [[Kate Harwood]] said, "For many years Wendy simply was ''EastEnders'' for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the ''EastEnders''' spirit...We thank her for everything she has done for the show..."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/11/richard.shtml|title=Wendy Richard MBE to leave EastEnders|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

Although it has been suggested by some that Pauline's presence in ''EastEnders'' was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike.<ref name="soaplife">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5166062.stm|title=Wendy Richard's dramatic soap life|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=[[10 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> ''[[Inside Soap]]'' editor Steven Murphy has said that the fact Pauline has been such an enduring staple will make it hard for fans to cope with her departure. "It's huge in soap terms... She's a character people love to hate — you just assumed she would be there forever." Jonathan Hughes, editor of ''All About Soap'' magazine, has also said "She's an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of ''EastEnders'' for so many years."<ref name="soaplife"/> 

In May 2007, Wendy Richard was awarded with a 'Lifetime Achievement' award at the [[British Soap Awards]], to honour her years of service to ''EastEnders''. The award was presented by [[Todd Carty]], who played her on-screen son Mark. Carty described Richard as the "heart and soul of ''EastEnders''" and hailed her as an "inspiration" to everyone in the ''EastEnders'' cast.<ref name="award1">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=457959&in_page_id=1773|title=Corrie sweeps the board at soap awards|publisher=''Daily Mail''|date=[[28 May]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> Richard was moved to tears when she collected the award.<ref name="award2">"{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?in_article_id=50712&in_page_id=7&in_a_source= |title=Wendy moved by 'long service' award|publisher=''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]''|date=[[May 27]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Despite being popular with many, the character of Pauline has also garnered much criticism over the years. Persistent criticism has been given to the character's dowdy attire, particularly the misconceived perception that she rarely wears anything but a baggy cardigan;<ref name="stage"/> a claim that Wendy Richard herself categorically disputes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wgazette.com/aut06-beingpauline.html|title=The Importance of Being Pauline|publisher=''Walford Gazette''|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> In addition Pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour. She has been described as the "Wicked Witch of Walford"<ref name="times">{{cite news|http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article1264418.ece|title=Eastenders - Tim Teeman watching BBC One|publisher=''[[Times Online]]''|date=[[26 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> and "a character who became a byword for downtrodden haggery".<ref name="guardianculture">{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/archives/2006/07/11/post_113.html|title=Bye Then, Pauline|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=[[11 July]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> 

Lucy Mangan, the culture critic from ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, has gone on to sum up the character, commenting: "Pauline Fowler, is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable...She was presumably intended to be the anchoring force for ''EastEnders'', but because of the writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show."<ref name="guardianculture"/> This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35<sup>th</sup> most annoying person of 2006 in a [[BBC Three]] poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list.<ref name="BBC3">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0931335/ The Most Annoying People of 2006] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC3]] | city = London, England | airdate = 2006-12-27}}</ref>

In addition, Pauline's exit in December 2006 was described as a "mess" by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' newspaper. He branded her final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low - quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! [...] I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead."<ref name="mess">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20061231/ai_n17087968|title=XMAS EXIT WAS A PAULINE MESS|publisher=''Sunday Mirror''|date=[[31 December]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
''EastEnders'' was the first television show to have a "dial-a-soap" facility. Run by [[British Telecom]] in 1985, the facility allowed people who had missed an episode to ring a number and get an instant update. The synopses were scripted to be no longer than one minute and twenty-eight seconds per episode. Wendy Richard, in character as Pauline, was chosen to be the voice at the other end of the line and narrated each episode.<ref name="insidestory"/>

The character of Pauline was mentioned in the successful BBC drama ''[[This Life]]'' in 1997. In one episode of the show two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watched an episode of ''EastEnders'' on television and mocked Pauline's hysterics and her well documented tendency to wear cardigans.<ref name="thislife">{{cite episode |title=This Life |series= This Life|serieslink=This Life |credits= Including [[Daniela Nardini]], [[Andrew Lincoln]], [[Ramon Tikaram]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]]|began=1997-03-17 |ended=1997-08-07|season= 2}}</ref>

The character has also been spoofed in the successful BBC comedy sketch show, ''[[The Real McCoy (TV series)|The Real McCoy]]'' (1991-1995). One of the show's regular sketches featured a spoof version of ''EastEnders'', with [[black (people)|black]] comedians taking over roles of well known ''EastEnders'' characters who frequented a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian [[Llewella Gideon]] played the role of Pauline and the sketches placed considerable emphasis on her high-pitched voice.<ref name="rub">{{cite episode |title=The Real McCoy |series= The Real McCoy|serieslink=The Real McCoy (TV series) |credits= Including [[Llewella Gideon]], [[Meera Syal]], [[Felix Dexter]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]]|airdate=1996-02-02|season= 6|number=5}}</ref>

A promotional picture of Pauline and Joe was used on the official ''[[Torchwood]]'' website, in a fictional magazine article about aliens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torchwood.org.uk/html/gadgets/magazine.shtml|title=MAGAZINE ARTICLE, 2007|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref>
