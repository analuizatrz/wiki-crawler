==History==
{{main|History of Ohio Wesleyan University}}

===Founding===
[[Image:SulfurSpringAdjusted2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Sulphur Spring, renovated in 2005, was a major vacation spot for health seekers in the 1830s.]]

In 1841, Ohio residents Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university "of the highest order" in central Ohio.<ref>Williams, p. 15.</ref> To that end, they purchased the [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Elliott Hall|Mansion House Hotel]], a former health resort with its Sulfur Spring, using funds raised from local residents.<ref name="elliott">{{cite web | url = http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-a09.pdf| title = The University: Policy on Voluntary Sexual Relationships between Faculty/Staff and Students - Traditions (PDF) | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2005-09-01}}</ref><ref name="order">{{cite web | url = http://news.owu.edu/2003/elliott2.html| title = Elliott Hall Dedication | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2003-05-15}}</ref> Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing "the [[democracy|democratic]] spirit of teaching", which was approved by the [[Ohio]] State [[Legislature]]. Early in the following year they opened the [[college preparatory]] Academy and formed a [[Board of Trustees]].<ref>Hubbart, p. 14.</ref> Ohio Wesleyan University, named (like several other U.S. colleges and universities) after [[John Wesley]], founder of [[Methodism]], opened on November 13, 1844 as a Methodist-related but [[nonsectarian]] institution, with a College of Liberal Arts for male students.<ref>White, p. 229.</ref><ref name="liberal">{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/~catalog/cat-a04.pdf| title = Ohio Wesleyan University Catalogue | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2004-09-01}}</ref><ref name="amongfirst">{{cite web | author= Labaree, David F. | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~dlabaree/U.S.%20Universities%20Sorted%20by%20Founding%20Date%20ver%202.doc| title = U.S. Colleges and Universities | publisher = | accessdate = 2006-10-19}}</ref> 

Ohio Wesleyan's first president, [[Edward Thomson]], stated in his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]] on August 5, 1846 that the school was "a product of the [[classical liberalism|liberality]] of the local people."<ref>Hubbart, p. 22.</ref> This liberal philosophy  contributed to Wesleyan's vocal opposition to [[slavery]] in the 1850s.<ref name="1850issues">{{cite web | url = http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=231791077249253| title = Roots of Secession: Slavery and Politics in Antebellum Virginia | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | accessdate = 2005-10-15}}</ref><ref name="thompson">{{cite web | url = http://members.aol.com/revepete/HolinessCh3.html | title = The Methodist Movement Comes to America and Impacts Slavery | publisher = Reve' M.

===Curriculum growth and fundraising===
[[Image:ElliottHallOWU.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Elliott Hall, the first college building on campus, was renovated in 2000 and is [[Ohio]]'s oldest [[collegiate]] [[Greek Revival]] building.<ref>[http://www.owu.edu/news/2000/corns.html Renovated MUB Debuts as R.W. Corns Building]. Ohio Wesleyan University, [[2000-08-03]].  Retrieved on [[2007-01-08]].</ref>]]

During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment.<ref>Hubbart, p. 45.</ref> [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Sturges Hall|Sturges Hall]] was constructed as the University's first library in 1855.<ref name="sturges">{{cite web | url = http://admission.owu.edu/sturges.html|title = Sturges Hall |publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in [[History of Ohio Wesleyan University#Campus expansion|Merrick Hall]].<ref name="merrick">{{cite web | url = http://botany.owu.edu/depthist.html|title = Departmental History |publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> The [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]], established in 1853, merged with Wesleyan in 1877.<ref>Taylor, p.53.</ref><ref name="merged">{{cite web | url = http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=787|title = Ohio Wesleyan University|publisher = Ohio Historical Society|accessdate = 2006-10-19}}</ref> Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and [[music education]] greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.<ref>Hubbart, p. 68.</ref><ref>Hubbart, pp. 72–80.</ref>

By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844).<ref>Kukula, R. & K. Trubner (1923). ''Minerva: Jahrbuch der Gelehrten Welt''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Company</ref> To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#University Hall|University Hall]], [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Slocum Hall|Slocum Library]], extensions to the [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Monnett campus]], and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 87–88.</ref>
[[Image:GrayChapelAdjusted.jpg|right|thumb|250px|University Hall, built in 1893 on the academic quad, features [[Neoromanesque]] architecture.]]
Between 1891 and 1895, Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[geology]], [[Public speaking|speech]], [[history]], [[French language|French]], [[English studies|English]], and [[economics]].<ref>Hubbart, p. 90.</ref> This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe.<ref name="nsfphdrate"> {{cite web | url = http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06319/pdf/tabb1.pdf | title = Top 50 U.S. baccalaureate institutions of Ph.D.s: 1920–24 and 1995–99 (PDF)|publisher = National Science Foundation|accessdate = 2006-12-24}}</ref> Two professional schools for [[law]] and [[medicine]] were formed in 1896.

In 1905, the Board of Trustees decided to keep Ohio Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum and campus and the word "university" in the institution's name.<ref>Hubbart, p. 110.</ref> The [[Bachelor of Science]] degree was abolished, which left only the [[Bachelor of Arts]]. Two students were selected as [[Rhodes Scholars]] in 1905 and 1909.<ref>Hubbart, p. 112.</ref> [[Edwards Gymnasium]] was built in 1906.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bishops.owu.edu/hist1.html| title = The History of OWU Athletics |publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> In 1907, the United Societies of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, installed the "Eta of Ohio" ΦΒΚ chapter on campus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Chapter_Chronology&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=1624 | title = The Phi Beta Kappa Society: Chapter Chronology N-Z |publisher = The Phi Beta Kappa Society|accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> In 1909, the school added [[History of Ohio Wesleyan University#Campus expansion|Sanborn Hall]], housing the Music Department.<ref name="sanborn">{{cite web | url = http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-i04.pdf|title = Facilities |publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref>

In the 1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were reduced, and Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized.<ref>Hubbart, p. 142.</ref> During the presidency of [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|John W. Hoffman]] (1916–1928), the Academy and School of Business were closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]], and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment.<ref>Hubbart, p. 127.</ref> Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and [[sororities]] were formed. Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and [[Perkins Observatory]]; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.<ref>Hubbart, p. 141.</ref>

===Years of change, 1930–1984===
[[Image:StuyFront.png|250px|left|thumb|Stuyvesant Hall, built in 1930, is the oldest residence in use on West Campus.]]
During [[the Great Depression]], both enrollment and [[alumni]] donations shrank.<ref>Hubbart, pp.140–160.</ref> While the [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's survival in the administrations of [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Edmund D. Soper]] (1928–1938) and [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Herbert John Burgstahler]] (1938–1949).<ref>Tull, p.180.</ref> 

The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address these problems.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 160–164.</ref> Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history. The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from [[New England]] states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased. By the 1930s, the Methodist students were a minority among the student body;<ref>Burtchaell, pp. 174–175;</ref> formal ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920s<ref>Burtchaell, p.304–319.</ref> and led to debate among Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university's current active but loose historical affiliation with the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>Burtchaell, p.323.</ref> In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that "in its personnel, its resources, and its students", Wesleyan lost its "symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church."<ref>Burtchaell, p. 326.</ref> 

In 1946, Ohio Wesleyan introduced a new "Centennial Curriculum", which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement.<ref>Tull, p.182.</ref> Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954.<ref>Tull, p.182.</ref> In the 1960s, faculty, staff and administrators fought over administrative structure and control.<ref>Tull, pp.182–183.</ref> They eventually settled on a new "statement of aims" that stressed values, rather than religious goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a new Women's Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.<ref>Tull, p.183</ref>

Thomas Wenzlau's presidency (1968–1984) began with the challenge of campus unrest: Wesleyan students took over the [[ROTC]] building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970.<ref>Murchland, p.34</ref><ref>Murchland, p.74.</ref> Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Wesleyan grew in this period.<ref>Murchland, p.35</ref> Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing "[[party school]]" image,<ref>Murchland, p.38–39</ref> leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body.<ref>Murchland, p.39</ref> Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper ''[[The Transcript]]'' frequently criticized Wenzlau's  presidency, blaming it for "severely affecting the reputation of the college".<ref>Murchland, p.41</ref> This exchange resulted in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' report on the school that eventually precipitated the end of Wenzlau's presidency.<ref name="OWUandWP"> Peterson, Bill. "Enrollments Lower, Costs Higher". ''The Washington Post'', December 19, 1982, First Section, A5.</ref>

===1984–today===

The new president, David Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a "live-in" presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium focused on the liberal arts.<ref>Murchland, p.44–45</ref> Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[NBC]] networks.<ref>Murchland, p.45</ref> 

More recently, Ohio Wesleyan has achieved several academic and athletic recognitions. A 1986 study, titled "Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges," identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly selective "science-active" liberal arts institutions in the nation.<ref>[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED258532&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b801160bc Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges].

===Emphasis on internationalism===
[[Image:UniversityHallFlags.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Flags in University Hall of students' countries represented at Ohio Wesleyan University.]]
Ohio Wesleyan has upheld academic [[internationalism]] since its early years; since the 19th century, the college has established links with several international schools. In 1879, OWU alumna Elizabeth Russell founded [[Kwassui College|Kwassui Women's College]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], when predominant Japanese culture considered women's education unimportant.<ref>{{cite book | last = Windolf | first = Paul | coauthors = Francisco Ramirze | year = 1989 | title = Expansion and Structural Change: Higher Education in Germany, the United States, and Japan, 1870–1990 | publisher = Contemporary Sociology | location= | id =Vol. 27, No. 2}}</ref> Today, Kwasuii College is one of the top finishing schools for young women in Japan.<ref name="kwassuijp">{{cite web | url = http://www.kwassui.ac.jp/ | title = Kwassui Institute|publisher = Kwassui Institute|accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref> In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 1898) traveled to [[Africa]] and opened a school in [[Mutare]], [[Zimbabwe]], that eventually became the [[University of Africa|Africa University]].<ref name="africauniv">{{cite web | url = http://www.africau.edu/ | title = Africa University | publisher = Africa University | accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref>
[[Image:Plaza-mayor-salamanco.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Main Square of Salamanca. In March 1988, Conrad Kent established the popular Salamanca Spanish Program for Wesleyan students.]]
The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international students it recruits and enrolls annually. Since 1983, Ohio Wesleyan has been listed in ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' among colleges that attract the highest percentage of international students.<ref name="departmentofeducation">{{cite web | url = http://www.edupass.org/finaid/undergraduate.phtml | title = Schools with Financial Aid for International Undergraduate Students | publisher = Mark Kantrowitz | accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref><ref name="departmentofeducation2">{{cite web | url = http://www.edupass.org/admissions/schoolsearch.phtml | title = Choosing a School | publisher = Mark Kantrowitz | accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref><ref name="iied">{{cite web | url = http://opendoors.iienetwork.org/?p=49938 | title = International Students: Leading Institutions by Institutional Type | publisher = Institute of International Education | accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref><ref name="mostinternationalstudents">{{cite web | url = http://www.pmc.edu/about/ranking/2005/international.html | title = Most International Students | publisher = U.S.News & World Report| accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref> The percentage of international students grew in the early and mid-1990s.<ref name="chronicleOWUIntl">Desruisseaux, Paul.

High participation in formal exchange programs constitutes a third target of the school's international focus.<ref>Tull, p. 140.</ref> Under a [[Great Lakes Colleges Association]] agreement, OWU established an exchange program with [[Waseda University]] in 1962 to provide approximately 30 American students with opportunities to study in [[Japan]] and 30 Japanese students to study at Wesleyan each year.<ref name="waseda">{{cite web | url = http://www.waseda.jp/intl-ac/bulletin/c14.html | title = Agreements with Overseas Institutions | publisher = Waseda University | accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref> The Salamanca program, founded by Conrad Kent in 1988,<ref name="salamanca">{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/~jjarriba/Salamanca/programhistory.htm|title = Ohio Wesleyan University: The Salamanca Program|publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref> conducts the exchange of approximately one hundred students and faculty between OWU and the [[University of Salamanca]] in [[Spain]]. The academic collaboration frequently extends to joint participation in academic symposia: in 1993, members of the Salamanca faculty participated in a symposium on the [[Golden Age]] in Salamanca.<ref name="salamanca">{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/~jjarriba/Salamanca/programhistory.htm | title = Ohio Wesleyan University: The Salamanca Program | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref>

==Campus==
{{main|List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings}}
{{seealso|Richard Ross Museum of Art|Ohio Wesleyan University Library|The Strand Theatre}}
The Ohio Wesleyan campus is located adjacent to downtown Delaware, and is bisected by Sandusky Street, the main north/south street through the heart of the city. The street informally divides the campus into an eastern sector composed mainly of academic buildings and a western sector composed mainly of residential and administrative buildings. Many facilities have been constructed in the last two years, with substantial benefit to science, art, and athletic programs on campus.

===Other facilities and off-campus programs===
{{main|Perkins Observatory|Ohio Wesleyan Arts Castle|The Strand Theatre|New York Arts House}}

OWU operates several facilities outside campus: The Philadelphia Business Center, Wesleyan in Washington, The New York Arts Program for the performing, visual and media arts (a GLCA arts program), [[Perkins Observatory]], [[The Strand Theatre]], and the [[Kraus Preserve of Ohio Wesleyan University|Kraus Wilderness Preserve]]. 

Perkins Observatory is situated in Delaware on land separate to the main campus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.perkins-observatory.org/programs.html#directions | title = How to find us | publisher = Perkins Observatory | accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> The observatory is named after [[Hiram Perkins]], a former professor of mathematics and astronomy at the college.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.perkins-observatory.org/history.html#hiram | title = Hiram Perkins|publisher = Perkins Observatory|accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> When the observatory was built in 1931, it housed the third-largest [[telescope]] in the world, which has since been moved to [[Arizona]].<ref name=PerkinsHistory>{{cite web | url = http://www.perkins-observatory.org/history.html#69 | title = History of Perkins Observatory | publisher = Perkins Observatory|accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> The Perkins dome now houses a {{convert|32|in|mm|sing=on}} telescope, which is the second-largest in Ohio.

The university also maintains offices for [[study abroad]], US domestic study, and [[internship]] programs. Such programs include: Wesleyan in Washington, which allows students to study for a semester in [[Washington, D.C.]], in research and [[internship]] positions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/49.php | title = Learning in Washington | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-10-14}}</ref> The Philadelphia Center offers students hundreds of internship and field placement opportunities off-campus and the chance to live independently.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/52.php | title = Philadelphia Center Gives Students Taste of Life in the Big City | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> and the New York Arts Program, which allows students of the arts to gain a semester of hands on experience in the arts in [[New York City]].<ref name=NYArtsProgram>{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorkartsprogram.org | title = Wesleyan Arts Program | publisher = New York Arts Program |accessdate = 2007-11-21}}</ref>
===Community relations===

The Wesleyan Ambassadors Program (ISAP) promotes cultural diversity and ethnic awareness within the local community,<ref name = "isap"/> and exposes international students to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] through the community. The program's ambassadors visit local schools to give presentations and participate in events for local [[non-profit]] community organizations.<ref name="isap">{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/56.php | title = New International Student Ambassador Program at OWU | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}</ref>

Campus organizations cooperate with local residents on issues of [[civic]] participation and [[activism]]. Progress OWU allows students from Wesleyan and local schools to express their voices on [[politics]], [[public policy]], and [[corporate]] and [[social issues]], both on campus and in the local community.<ref name="progressservice">{{cite web | url = http://service.owu.edu/organizations.html | title = Student Service Clubs, Organizations and Small Living Units | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}</ref>

Cultural programs also take part in community relations. In the 1960s, Wesleyan donated the Arts Castle, then part of the Fine Arts department, to the City of Delaware. It is now home to the Delaware County Cultural Arts Center. The Arts Castle hosts a variety of community programs in art, and offers classes ranging from ballet to fine arts.<ref name="artscastle">{{cite web | url = http://www.artscastle.org/house.html | title = History of The Arts Castle | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University, The Arts Castle | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}</ref> In 2004, the OWU received a donation to rehabilitate the historic [[The Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] in downtown Delaware.<ref name="strandpurchase">{{cite web | url = http://www.owu.edu/news/2002/strand.html | title = Gift Support Enables OWU to Purchase Strand Theatre | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref>

[[Image:RedBlackCap.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Freshmen were required to wear a red and black cap in public in the 1920s.]]

Many Ohio Wesleyan traditions originate from Wesleyan's early years. Monnett Weekend, beginning in 1896, welcomes female alumni, parents, and friends of Wesleyan. Events include a "People's Parade" with clowns, banners and marching, faculty lectures, Maypole dancing, Choral Arts Society, and an all-campus carnival.<ref>Murchland, p.79.</ref><ref>Hubbart, p. 121.</ref> It started as a girls' athletic fête held at the Monnett Athletic Club for Mothers Day. All events were held at the [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Monnett Campus]], where female students danced around the [[Maypole]], while men were barred. The men, in turn, developed their own tradition: they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning, and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities, discreetly.<ref>Tull, p.102.</ref> 

In 1884, Ohio Wesleyan held its first ''Mock Convention'', which has recurred in every [[presidential election]] year since 1920.<ref name="mockconvention">{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/%7Emock2004/cygnus/rules.htm| title = Mock Convention

Beginning in the 1920s, all freshmen were required to wear "dinks", red caps with black brims and a black W on the front.<ref>Tull, p.98–99.</ref> Disobedient students who refused to wear the "dink" were tossed into the ''Sulphur Spring'' (see later reference). This tradition ended in the 1950s. The freshman class of 1957 wore dinks for half the first semester. <!-- which year, specifically? -->.<ref>Murchland, p.64.</ref>

===Housing===
[[Image:PeaceandJusticeWinter.jpg|thumb|right|The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus.]]
The university can house up to 1,600 students on campus.<ref name = "housingcapacity"/> First-year students are required to live on campus during their first two semesters. A lottery system matches second to fourth-year students with dormitories and another lottery system determines how many students are allowed to live in off-campus housing. Housing options include dormitories, small living units, fraternities, and cooperative housing.<ref name="generalhousing">{{cite web | url = http://admission.owu.edu/reslife.html | title = Residential Life | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2007-01-05}}</ref> 

Thompson, Bashford, Stuyvesant, and Smith Halls are large mid-rise dormitories on campus.

[[Image:N24101750 30197695 4010.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Students converse on the back porch of The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus.]]
Approximately 200 non-freshmen students live in Small Living Units (SLUs), which are [[cooperative|co-ops]] united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses. The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties. Each unit houses a group of 15 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually indicated by the co-op's name. As of the 2008–2009 academic year, the SLUs consist of The [[Peace]] and [[Justice]] House, The [[Internationalism (politics)|International]] House, The House of [[Black (people)|Black]] Culture, The Creative [[Arts]] House, The [[Women]]'s House, The Modern Foreign [[Languages]] House, The House of Thought, The [[Ecology|Tree]] House, and The Interfaith House. The University owns these houses; the co-ops, therefore, must follow the University's living policies. The co-ops do, however, elect their own officers and do not have [[resident assistant|Resident Advisers]] or faculty in residence like other on-campus residence halls. They have a House Moderator who undergoes the same training as a Resident Advisor. At the end of each academic year, every existing and potential co-op must submit a house proposal describing its plans for theme promotion for the next academic year. The University Housing office places co-ops in houses every year on a competitive basis.<ref name="SLUprocess">{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/ourtown/95.php | title = SLUSH is Here: Apply to your Favorite SLU | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = 2007-01-05}}</ref>
