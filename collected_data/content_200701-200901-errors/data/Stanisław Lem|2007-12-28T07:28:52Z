'''Stanisław Lem''' ({{audio|pl-Stanisław Lem.ogg|pronunciation}}, [[September 12]], [[1921]] – [[March 27]], [[2006]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[science fiction]], [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[satire|satirical]] writer. His books have been translated into 41 languages and have sold over 27 million copies.<ref name="41/27">[http://www.lem.pl/cyberiadinfo/english/obi/ob.htm Stanislaw Lem 1921 - 2006]. Obituary at Lem's official site</ref> In 1976, [[Theodore Sturgeon]] claimed that Lem was the most widely read science-fiction writer in the world.<ref name="Strugatsky">[[Theodore Sturgeon]]: [http://www.russiansifiction.com/translated/strugazckie/picnic/ Introduction] to ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc, New York 1976</ref>

His works explore [[philosophical]] themes; speculation on [[technology]], the nature of [[intelligence]], the impossibility of mutual [[communication]] and understanding, despair about human limitations and humankind's place in the universe. They are sometimes presented as [[fiction]], but others are in the form of [[essay]]s or philosophical books. Translations of his works are difficult; [[Michael Kandel]]'s translations into English have generally been praised as capturing the spirit of the original.

== Biography ==
Lem was born in 1921 into a [[Jewish]] family in [[Lviv|Lwów]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (now [[Ukraine]]). He was the son of Sabina Woller and Samuel Lem, a wealthy [[laryngology|laryngologist]], former [[physician]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. His family was secular Jewish<ref name="UCD">Stanislaw Lem: [http://cse.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/courses/ncaso/Readings/Lem_CAO_NY1984.html Chance and Order], autobiographical essay, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' 59 (30 January 1984) 88-98; [http://www.thejc.com/home.aspx?ParentId=m11&AId=43913 Lives in Brief], ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', 18 May 2006</ref><ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=entertainment&id=4029603 Polish Science Fiction Writer Stanislaw Lem Dies At 84]</ref>, but Lem was raised a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and later viewed himself as an [[atheism|atheist]] "for moral reasons ... the world appears to me to be put together in such a painful way that I prefer to believe that it was not created ... intentionally".<ref name="MisI"> [http://missourireview.com/printable.php?genre=Interviews&title=An+Interview+with+Stanislaw+Lem An Interview with Stanislaw Lem] by [[Peter Engel]]. ''[[Missouri Review]]'' Volume 7, Number 2, 1984.</ref> After the Soviet occupation of Eastern Poland, he was not allowed to study at the Polytechnic as he wished because of his "[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] origin" and only due to his father's connections was accepted to study medicine at [[University of Lviv|Lwów University]] in 1940<ref> http://www.lem.pl/cyberiadinfo/english/osobie/biogrys.htm</ref>. During [[World War II]] and the [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|Nazi occupation]], Lem survived with false papers, earning a living as a car mechanic and welder, and becoming active in [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|the resistance]]. In [[1946]], Polish eastern ''[[Kresy]]'' were annexed into the [[Soviet Ukraine]]<ref name="EB">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9384402 Lem, Stanislaw. (2006)] In ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved June 30, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service</ref> and the family, like many other Poles, was resettled to [[Kraków]] where Lem at his father's pressure took up medical studies at the [[Jagiellonian University]]. Since he refused to tailor his answers to the prevailing [[Lysenkoism]], Lem failed his final examinations on purpose so as not to be obliged to become a military doctor.<ref> http://www.lem.pl/cyberiadinfo/english/osobie/biogrys2.htm</ref> Earlier he had started working as a research assistant in a scientific institution and writing stories in his spare time.

[[Image:Stanislaw Lem by Kubik.JPG|thumb|left|Lem signing in [[Kraków]], 30 October 2005]]

Lem made his literary debut in 1946 as a poet, and at that time he also published several [[dime novel]]s. Beginning that year, Lem's first [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Człowiek z Marsa]]'' (''The Man from Mars'') was serialized in the magazine ''[[Nowy Świat Przygód]]'' (New World of Adventures). Between 1947 and 1950 Lem, while continuing his work as a scientific research assistant, published poems, short stories, and scientific essays. However, during the era of [[Stalinism]], all published works had to be directly approved by the [[communist regime]]. Lem finished a partly autobiographical novella ''[[Hospital of the Transfiguration]]'' (''Szpital Przemienienia'') in 1948, but it was suppressed by the authorities until 1955 when he added a sequel more acceptable to the doctrine of [[socialist realism]]. In 1951 he published his first book, ''Astronauci'' (''[[The Astronauts]]''); it was commissioned as juvenile SF and Lem was forced to include many references to the 'glorious future of communism' in it. He later criticized this novel (as well as several of his other early pieces, bowing to the ideological pressure) as simplistic; nonetheless its publication convinced him to become a full-time writer.<ref name="EB"/>

The [[Khrushchev Thaw|de-Stalinization period]] culminating in the [[Polish October]] of [[1956]] produced greater [[freedom of speech]] and thought in Poland. Lem then started his career as a serious international science fiction author, writing some 17 books in the next dozen years. His works were widely translated abroad (although mostly in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries). In 1957 he published his first non-fiction, philosophical book, ''Dialogi'' (Dialogues). ''Dialogi'' and ''[[Summa Technologiae]]'' (1964) are his two most famous philosophical texts.  The ''Summa'' is notable for being a unique analysis of prospective social, cybernetic, and biological advances. In this work, Lem discusses philosophical implications of technologies that were completely in the realm of [[science fiction]] then, but are gaining importance today - like, for instance, [[virtual reality]] and [[nanotechnology]]. Over the next decades, he published many books, both science fiction and philosophical/futurological, although since the 1980s he tended to concentrate on philosophical texts and essays.

[[Image:The cyberiad.JPG|thumb|right|1976 US edition of ''[[The Cyberiad]]''.]]
He gained international fame for ''[[The Cyberiad]]'', a series of humorous short stories from a mechanical universe ruled by robots, first published in English in 1974. His best-known novels include ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' (1961), ''[[His Master's Voice (novel)|His Master's Voice]]'' (''Głos pana'', 1983), and the late ''[[Fiasco (novel)|Fiasco]]'' (''Fiasko'', 1987), expressing most strongly his major theme of the futility of mankind's attempts to comprehend the truly alien. ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' was made into a film in 1972 by Russian director [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and won a Special Jury Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1972<ref name="EB"/>; in 2002, [[Steven Soderbergh]] directed a Hollywood remake starring [[George Clooney]].

In [[1982]], with [[martial law in Poland]] declared, Lem moved to [[West Berlin]] where he became a fellow of the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin]] (''Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin''). After that, he settled in [[Vienna]]. He returned to Poland in [[1988]].

Lem died in Kraków on [[March 27]], [[2006]] at the age of 84 after a battle with heart disease.

=== SFWA controversy ===
Lem was awarded an honorary membership in the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America|Science Fiction Writers of America]] (SFWA) in [[1973]] despite being technically ineligible.  SFWA Honorary membership is given to people who do not meet the criteria for joining the regular membership but who would be welcomed as members. Lem, however, never had a high opinion of American science-fiction, describing it as ill thought-out, poorly written, and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms.<ref name="faq.htm sfwa">http://www.lem.pl/cyberiadinfo/english/faq/faq.htm#sfwa</ref>  After his American publication, when he was eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded.  Some of the SFWA members apparently intended this as a rebuke,<ref>http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/14/lemaffair14.htm</ref> and it seems that Lem interpreted it thus, but the organization's official line is that honorary membership is only extended to people who are not eligible for regular membership. After his American publication, Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but declined.<ref name=SFWA>[http://www.sfwa.org/faq/lem.htm Lem and SFWA] in [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] FAQ, "paraphrasing [[Jerry Pournelle]]" who was SFWA President 1973-4</ref>

Lem singled out only one American SF writer for praise, [[Philip K. Dick]] - see the 1986 English-language anthology of his critical essays, ''Microworlds''. Dick, however, considered Lem to be a composite committee operating on orders of the Party to gain control over public opinion, and wrote a letter to the FBI to that effect.<ref> [http://www.lem.pl/cyberiadinfo/english/faq/faq.htm#dick P.K.Dick, Letter to FBI] quoted on Lem's homepage</ref> After many members (including [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]) protested Lem's treatment by the SFWA, a member offered to pay his dues.  Lem never accepted the offer. He had also been critical of science fiction in general, and had recently distanced himself from the genre, saying that his early works may have been SF, but his later ones were more mainstream.<ref name=SFWA /><ref name="faq.htm sfwa"/>

== Themes ==
Though several specific themes recur in all his works, Lem's fiction is commonly sorted into two major groups.<ref name="EB"/> The first includes his more traditional science fiction, with its speculations of technological advances, space travel, and alien worlds, such as ''[[Eden (novel)|Eden]]'' (1959), ''[[Return from the Stars]]'' (1961), ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' (1961), ''[[The Invincible]]'' (1964), ''[[His Master's Voice (novel)|His Master's Voice]]'' (1968), and ''[[Tales of Pirx the Pilot]]'' (1968). The second group contains [[allegory|allegorical]] tales, or [[fable]]s, such as ''[[The Star Diaries]]'' (1957), ''[[Memoirs Found in a Bathtub]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Cyberiad]]'' (1965).

One of Lem's primary themes was the impossibility of communication between humans and profoundly alien civilizations. His aliens are often incomprehensible to the human mind, be they swarms of mechanical insects (in ''[[The Invincible]]'') and a living ocean (in ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'') or strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in ''[[Fiasko]]'' and ''[[Eden (novel)|Eden]]'', describing the failure of the [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]]. Lem's book ''[[Return from the Stars]]'' follows an astronaut's adjustment to a radically changed human society after spending 100 years in space. In ''[[His Master's Voice (novel)|His Master's Voice]]'' Lem is critical of humanity's intelligence and intentions in deciphering and truly comprehending an apparent message from space.     

He wrote about human [[technological progress]] and the problem of human existence in a world where technological development makes biological human impulses obsolete or dangerous. He was also critical of most of science fiction, criticizing it in novels (''[[His Master's Voice (novel)|His Master's Voice]]''), literary and philosophical essays (''[[Fantastyka i futurologia]]'') and interviews.<ref name="interview.htm"> http://www.lem.pl/cyberiadinfo/english/interview2/interview.htm</ref> In the 1990s Lem forswore science fiction and returned to futurological prognostications, most notably those expressed in ''[[Okamgnienie]]'' (Blink of an Eye). He became increasingly critical of modern technology in his later life, criticizing inventions such as the [[Internet]].<ref name="interview.htm"/>

In many novels, humans become an irrational and emotional liability to their machine partners, who are not perfect either. Issues of [[technological utopia]]s appeared in ''[[Peace on Earth (novel)|Peace on Earth]]'', in ''[[Observation on the Spot]]'', and, to a lesser extent, in ''[[The Cyberiad]]''.

Lem often placed his characters — like the spaceman [[Ijon Tichy]] of ''[[The Star Diaries]]'', [[Pirx]] the pilot (of ''[[Tales of Pirx the Pilot]]''), or the narrator of ''[[Return from the Stars]]'' in strange, new settings. Thrust into the unknown, he used them to personify various aspects of the possible futures, often having them balance on the thin line separating his belief in the inherent goodness of humanity and his deep pessimism about human limitations.

He also often deploys a wicked sense of humor in his descriptions of even the darkest human situations, most famously in ''[[The Futurological Congress]]'' and ''[[Memoirs Found in a Bathtub]]''. In this regard, he has sometimes been compared to [[Kurt Vonnegut]] or [[Franz Kafka]]. Many of his lighter tales are about [[Ijon Tichy]], a cosmic traveller in his one-man spaceship, whose adventures challenge commonly accepted ideas about things like time travel, the nature of the soul, and the origin of the universe, in a satiric and ironic, yet undeniably logical way. For example, ''The Futurological Congress'' is a hilarious [[satire]] on government and [[academic conference]]s. In a Kafkaesque turn, at a hotel in [[Costa Rica]], a conference to propose solutions to overpopulation in a time of violence and terrorism soon dissolves into chaos as the hotel's water supply is contaminated by a hallucinogen.

Three of his novels are likely his most famous.<ref name="EB"/> ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'', filmed twice, is set on an isolated research station above the planet Solaris, and is a philosophical work about contact with a completely alien lifeform — a planet-wide sentient ocean. ''[[Głos Pana]]'' (His Master's Voice) is a very philosophical - much more so than Solaris - story of a scientific effort to decode, translate and understand an [[wikt:Extraterrestrial|extraterrestrial]] transmission, critically approaching humanity's intelligence and intentions in deciphering and truly comprehending a message from space. Lem's third great book is ''[[The Cyberiad]]''. Subtitled ''Fables for the Cybernetic Age'', it is a collection of comic tales about two [[robot]] "constructors" who travel about the Galaxy solving engineering problems; but a deeper reading reveals a wealth of profound insights into the human condition.

== Influence ==
[[Franz Rottensteiner]], Lem's former agent instrumental in introducing him to the Western audience, but with whom they later separated on bitter terms, summarized his importance: {{quotation| With  [number of translations and copies sold], Lem is the most successful author in modern Polish fiction; nevertheless his commercial success in the world is limited, and the bulk of his large editions was due to the special publishing conditions in the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist countries]]: [[History of Poland (1945-1989)|Poland]], the [[Soviet Union]], and the [[German Democratic Republic]]). Only in [[West Germany]] was Lem really a critical and a commercial success [... and everywhere... ] in recent years interest in him has waned.

But he is the only writer of European SF of whom most books have been translated into [[English language|English]], and [...] kept in print in the USA. Lem's critical success in English is due mostly to the excellent translations of [[Michael Kandel]]... | [[Franz Rottensteiner]] | View from Another Shore: European Science Fiction | 4 = second updated edition, Liverpool University Press 1999, ISBN 0-85323942-8, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wxt9s6UmcSQC&pg=PA252&lpg=PA252&vq=Lem&sig=W4JfINs2AYtGkkZNUVR7XRLNoGQ Note on the Authors: Stanislaw Lem], p. 252}}

Stanisław Lem, whose works were influenced by such masters of [[Polish literature]] as [[Cyprian Norwid]] and [[Stanislaw Witkiewicz]], chose the language of science fiction as in the communist [[People's Republic of Poland]] it was easier &mdash; and safer &mdash; to express ideas veiled in the world of fantasy and fiction than in the world of reality. Despite this &mdash; or perhaps because of this &mdash; he has become one of the most highly acclaimed science-fiction writers, hailed by critics as equal to the likes of [[H. G. Wells]] or [[Olaf Stapledon]].<ref name="Times">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2106311,00.html |title=Stanislaw Lem |publisher= ''[[The Times]]'' |date=[[2006-03-28]]}}</ref>

Lem's works influenced not only the realm of literature, but that of science as well. {{quotation| In 1981 the philosophers [[Douglas R. Hofstadter]] and [[Daniel C. Dennett]] included three extracts from Lem’s fiction in their important annotated anthology ''[[The Mind's I]]''. ... Hofstadter commented that Lem’s "literary and intuitive approach... does a better job of convincing readers of his views than any hard-nosed scientific article... might do".<ref name="Times"/>}}

Lem's works have even been used as teaching texts for philosophy students.<ref name="textbook">For instance, in the subject Natural and Artificial Thinking, Faculty of Math. & Phys., [[Charles University in Prague]], or [http://www.phil.muni.cz/fil/sci-fi/program.html Philosophy in sci-fi] at [[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno]]</ref>

Texts by Lem were set to music by [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] in his [[1982 in music|1982]] piece, ''Floof''.
