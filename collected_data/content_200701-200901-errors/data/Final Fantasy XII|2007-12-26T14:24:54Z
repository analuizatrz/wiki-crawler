{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy XII'''''|ファイナルファンタジーXII|Fainaru Fantajī Tuerubu}} is a [[console role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Enix]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] [[video game console]], and the twelfth installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy (series)|Final Fantasy]]'' video game series. It was released in [[2006 in video gaming|2006]], and was the first [[single player]] ''Final Fantasy'' title of the main series since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' five years earlier.<ref name="5years">{{cite web | author=Jeffrey Loor | year=[[November 1]], [[2006]]| title=The latest installment... | format= | work=Ars Technica | url=http://arstechnica.com/reviews/games/ff12.ars | accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> Selling more than two million copies in Japan,<ref name="2mil">{{cite web | author=| year=[[May 24]], [[2006]]| title=Square Enix Conference Report| format= | work=GameWatch | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2006/1287.html | accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref> it became the fourth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of 2006 worldwide.<ref name="4thbest">{{cite web | author=IGN | year=2006 | title=PS2 2006 Year in Review | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/749/749553p2.html | accessdaymonth=6 March | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The game takes place in the [[fictional location]] called [[Ivalice]], where the empires of Archadia and Rozarria are waging an endless war. Dalmasca, a small kingdom, is caught between the warring nations. When Archadia invades and occupies Dalmasca, its princess, Ashe, creates a resistance movement. During the struggle, she meets Vaan, a young adventurer who dreams of commanding an airship. They are quickly joined by a band of allies; together, they rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire.

''Final Fantasy XII'' introduced several innovations to the series: battles occur without a transition to a separate screen; a "gambit" system automatically controls the actions of characters; and a "license" system determines which abilities and equipment are used by characters.<ref name="IGNreview">{{cite web|author=Dunham, Jeremy|date=2006-10-27|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/741/741991p1.html|title=Final Fantasy XII review|publisher=IGN.com|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref><ref name="Gamespotreview">{{cite web|author=Kasavin, Greg|date=2006-10-31|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/review.html|title=Final Fantasy XII for PlayStation 2 Review|publisher=GameSpot.com; CNET Networks|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> ''Final Fantasy XII'' also includes elements from previous games in the series, such as [[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|summoned monsters]],<ref name="Gamespotreview"/> [[Chocobo]]s,<ref name="GUIDE14">{{cite book |editor=Square Enix|title=Final Fantasy XII North American instruction manual|origdate= |origyear=2006|publisher=Square Enix|language=English|pages=14}}</ref> and [[Airship (Final Fantasy)|airships]].<ref name="IGNreview"/> The game received universally high scores, and earned numerous "[[Game of the Year]]" awards in various categories from noted [[video game journalism|video game publications]]. The sequel, ''[[Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings]]'', was released for the [[Nintendo DS]] on [[April 26]] [[2007]] in Japan and was released in North America on [[November 20]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | year=[[September 21]], [[2006]]| title=TGS 2006: Final Fantasy XII Update| url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/733/733945p1.html | work=[http://www.ign.com/ IGN] | accessdate=2006-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = Jeriaska | year=2007-07-14 | title = Square Enix gesticulates in regards to Revenant Wings bonus content | url=http://www.square-haven.com/news/2007/07/14/E3-2007-Square-Enix-gesticulates-in-regards-to-Revenant-Wings-bonus-co | accessdate=2007-07-15}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Throughout the game, the player directly controls the onscreen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Unlike previous games in the series, the player can also control the camera with the right analog stick, allowing for a 360° view of the surroundings.<ref name="GUIDE12">{{cite book |editor=Square Enix|title=Final Fantasy XII North American instruction manual|year=2006|publisher=Square Enix|language=English|pages=12}}</ref> While in towns and cities, the player may only see from the perspective of Vaan, although any character may be controlled in battle. The world of ''Final Fantasy XII'' is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the [[overworld|world]] by foot, by [[Chocobo]],<ref name="GUIDE14"/> or by airship.<ref name="IGNreview"/> Players may save their game to a [[memory card]] using save crystals and may also teleport between special gate crystals.<ref name="GUIDE15">{{cite book |editor=Square Enix|title=Final Fantasy XII North American instruction manual|year=2006|publisher=Square Enix|language=English|pages=15}}</ref> An in-game bestiary provides incidental information about the world of ''Final Fantasy XII''.<ref name="GUIDE19">{{cite book |editor=Square Enix|title=Final Fantasy XII North American instruction manual|year=2006|publisher=Square Enix|language=English|pages=19}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy XII'' largely reforms the system of earning [[Final Fantasy items#Currency|gil]], the currency of the ''Final Fantasy'' games. Instead of gil, most enemies drop "loot", which can be sold at shops.<ref name="GUIDE288">{{cite book |editor=BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=288}}</ref> This ties into a new battle mechanic which rewards the player with improved loot for slaying a particular type of monster multiple times in a row.<ref name="BRADY41">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=41–42 }}</ref> Selling different types of loot also unlocks a Bazaar option in shops, which provides items at a lower cost, or items exclusive to the Bazaar.<ref name="GUIDE288"/>

===Battle system===
[[Image:Final Fantasy XII JAP FF12.jpg|thumb|left|170px|A standard battle; blue lines depict the player's targets and red lines depict those of the enemies.]]
Unlike the previous ''Final Fantasy'' games which used a turn-based system, battles in ''Final Fantasy XII'' occur in the open field, however [[menu (computing)|menus]] are still used to issue commands to the characters. Combat unfolds in real time, using a new system called ''[[Square Enix battle systems#Real Time Battle|active dimension battle]]'' (ADB), which allows the player to battle in the [[overworld]] instead of in a separate battle screen.<ref name="BRADY35">{{cite book |editor=BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=35–36}}</ref> The player may issue commands to any of the three characters in the battle party at will or allow "gambits", which issue automatic commands under certain triggers, to allow the characters to act on their own; however, certain "guest" characters are controlled by the game's [[artificial intelligence|AI]].<ref name="BRADY37">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=37 }}</ref> Battle commands include ''Attack'', ''Magicks & Technicks'', ''Mist'', ''Gambits'', and ''Items''. Using these abilities, the player must destroy enemies before being defeated.

"[[Random encounter]]s" have been eliminated in ''Final Fantasy XII''; the transition to a separate battle screen like in other ''Final Fantasy'' titles is absent.<ref name="BRADY35"/> Instead, enemies are visible in the overworld before an engagement and the player may choose to fight or avoid them in open combat. A battle begins when the party comes within range of an aggressive enemy (or vice versa), if the party attacks a nonaggressive enemy, or if a story event initiates a confrontation.<ref name="BRADY35"/> When a character or enemy begins to perform an action, target lines connect characters to other party members or enemies; different colors represent the type of action.<ref name="BRADY39">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=38–39}}</ref> The player may switch any active character with an inactive character at any time, unless the active character is targeted by an attack or ability. Characters who are knocked out may also be substituted. The absence of a transition to a battle screen meant the usual victory scene is also eliminated, though a successful "[[Boss (video games)|Boss]]" battle does present the player with a "Congratulations" screen and the participating characters in their victory poses.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy XII Battle Ultimania | pages= | publisher=Square Enix | language=Japanese | id=ISBN 4-7575-1697-7}}</ref>

Another new feature in ''Final Fantasy XII'' is the "gambit" system, which allows the player to program each character to perform certain commands in battle in response to specified conditions.<ref name="BRADY29">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=29 }}</ref> Using gambits, the player may set reactions to different stimuli for each character. Each gambit consists of three parts: a target, an action, and a priority. The target specifies which ally or foe to act on and the condition for applying the action. For example, the target "Ally: HP < 70%" causes the character to target any ally whose HP has fallen below 70%. The action is the command to be performed on the target. The priority determines which gambit to perform when multiple gambits are triggered. This rudimentary AI programming scheme allows the characters to act on their own, although player-inputted commands are always given top priority.<ref name="BRADY29"/>

[[Image:Mateus-ffxii.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Espers, such as Mateus, pictured, aid in battle.]]
In ''Final Fantasy XII'', a mysterious phenomenon, "Mist", is the key energy which allows the player to [[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|cast summoning magic]] and perform "Quickenings", the game's version of [[Limit Break]]s. After defeating one in combat, the player will be able to summon an "Esper" to the battlefield.<ref name="BRADY44">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=44 }}</ref> Similar to ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', the summoned creatures become active participants in battle,<ref name="BRADY44"/> as opposed to the cinematic attacks seen in previous games in the series. Unlike ''Final Fantasy X'', however, Espers follow hidden gambits, rather than the player's direct command.<ref name="BRADY44"/> The summoner remains an active member in the fight, able to attack and cast support magic, instead of leaving the party or standing idle while the summoned creature fights.<ref name="BRADY44"/> An Esper will leave the battle if either the summoner or itself is knocked out, its time limit expires, or it executes its special attack.<ref name="BRADY44"/> Some Espers have origins in the two installments of the ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' series and others are derived from the final bosses of previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, such as [[Chaos (Final Fantasy)|Chaos]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy IV#Major villains|Zeromus]].

''Final Fantasy XII'' introduces a new [[Limit Break]] system similar to those in previous games in the series: "Quickenings" ("Mist Knacks" in the Japanese version of the game).<ref name="BRADY58">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=58 }}</ref> Characters learn Quickenings by progressing to specific panels on the License Board.<ref name="BRADY58"/> Each character can learn three Quickenings, which are unique to that character.<ref name="BRADY58"/> Characters may string together Quickenings into large combo attacks, called Mist Chains.<ref name="BRADY58"/> If a Mist Chain reaches a certain number of attacks, a final strike will be initiated at the end of the Quickening cycle, called a Concurrence.<ref name="BRADY58"/>

===License Board===
[[Image:FFXII License Board.png|thumb|right|170px|The License Board; raised panels indicate acquired licenses.]]
Like most role-playing games, characters [[experience point#Level-based progression|level up]] each time they earn a set number of [[experience point]]s from defeating enemies; each "level" gained increases the character's [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]], thus improving their performance in battle.<ref name="GUIDE17">{{cite book |editor=Square Enix|title=Final Fantasy XII North American instruction manual|year=2006|publisher=Square Enix|language=English|pages=17}}</ref> Statistics include [[hit point]]s, the amount of damage a character can receive; strength, the power of the character's physical attacks; and magic, the potency of the character's [[Final Fantasy magic|magical spells]].<ref name="GUIDE17"/>

In addition to leveling up, players may improve their characters via the License Board. The License Board is an oddly shaped array of panels that contain "licenses"—[[license|permits]] which allow a character to perform certain actions.<ref name="BRADY18">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=18 }}</ref> The board is split into two parts; the upper part contains Magick, Technick, Accessory, and Augment (stat-raising) licenses, and the bottom part is filled mostly with Weapon and Armor licenses.<ref name="BRADY20">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=20 }}</ref> To use an [[statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|ability]] or piece of equipment, the character must obtain its corresponding license by spending the required amount of LP (License Points) to permit its use.<ref name="BRADY18"/> LP are earned in battle along with the experience points. Like ''Final Fantasy X'''s [[Final Fantasy X#Sphere Grid|Sphere Grid]], all characters may obtain all licenses on the board; however, each Quickening and Esper license may only be activated by a single character.<ref name="GUIDE23">{{cite book |editor=Square Enix|title=Final Fantasy XII North American instruction manual|year=2006|publisher=Square Enix|language=English|pages=23}}</ref>

[[Image:Ivalice (FF12).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Map of Ivalice in ''Final Fantasy XII'', displaying all in-game locations.]]
''Final Fantasy XII'' is set within the land of [[Ivalice]] during an age when "magic was commonplace" and "airships plied the skies, crowding out the heavens". At this time, magicite, a magic-rich mineral, is commonly used in magic spells<ref>Sage Knowledge 12 of 78 (Hybrid Gator Bestiary entry) Magicite - Common name for stones containing magickal power, or as it is commonly manifest, Mist. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square-Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> and in powering airships—a popular form of transportation in Ivalice.<ref>Sage Knowledge 14 of 78 (Steeling Bestiary entry) Airships - Currently, they are one of the most popular forms of transportation in Ivalice. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square-Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Ivalice is divided into three continents:<ref name="sleipnir"> Sage Knowledge 29 of 78 (Sleipnir Bestiary entry)<br />Ivalice - The region consisting of the three continents of Valendia, Ordalia, and Kerwon, blessed throughout with verdant natural landscapes and climatic conditions supporting a great variety of life. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Ordalia, Valendia, and Kerwon.<ref name="GUIDE12">{{cite book |editor=Square Enix|title=Final Fantasy XII North American instruction manual|year=2006|publisher=Square Enix|language=English|pages=12}}</ref> Ordalia is located in the western part of Ivalice.

Caught between the two powerful Empires, Dalmasca and a number of smaller nations have already been subjugated by Archadia two years before the game begins.

According to the game developers, design inspiration came from a mix of medieval [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] countries as demonstrated by the architectural styles found throughout Ivalice along with many of the races populating the region.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hirohiko Niizumi| year=[[November 19]], [[2003]]| title=Final Fantasy XII gets star treatment in Tokyo| format= | work= | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/news.html?sid=6083932 | accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> The art team visited [[Turkey]], which influenced the game’s Mediterranean-style setting.<ref name="Q&A">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff| year=[[November 20]], [[2003]]| title=Final Fantasy XII Q&A (page 2 of 4)| format= | work=IGN.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441293p2.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> The developers also used styles and deco from other sources including areas in [[India]] and [[New York City]].<ref name="ffshrine">{{cite web | author= | year=[[November 19]], [[2003]]| title=Final Fantasy XII Interview| format= | work= | url=http://www.ffshrine.org/ffxii/ff12_interview.php| accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref><ref name="Q&A"/> Of note is the use of [[Sanskrit]] in the city of [[Ivalice#Purvama Dorstonis|Bhujerba]].

===Characters===
{{main|Characters of Final Fantasy XII}}
[[Image:Ff12cast.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Cast of Final Fantasy XII]]
The six main playable characters in ''Final Fantasy XII'' are [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Vaan|Vaan]], an energetic orphan of Rabanastre who dreams of becoming a sky pirate; [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca|Ashe]], a determined princess of Dalmasca who lost her husband in the Archadian invasion; [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Basch fon Ronsenburg|Basch]], a disgraced knight of Dalmasca charged with treason for slaying the king; [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Balthier|Balthier]], a gentlemanly sky pirate who pilots his airship, the ''Strahl''; [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Fran|Fran]], Balthier's partner and a Viera exile whose knowledge extends to legends and myths; and [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Penelo|Penelo]], Vaan's childhood friend who accompanies him in journeys to keep an eye over him.<ref name="BRADY6">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=6–9 }}</ref>

The Archadian Empire is ruled by House Solidor, headed by Emperor Gramis.<ref name="BRADY10">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=10–15 }}</ref> The family also consists of two siblings, Vayne and Larsa, the former a militaristic genius and the latter a charismatic seeker of peace. Judge Magisters, upholders of Archadian law,<ref name="BRADY10"/> protect House Solidor and execute every command and order issued by the ruling family. The technological marvels of airships and synthetic nethicite—a form of magicite that absorbs Mist—are thanks to Dr. Cid, a prominent researcher from Archadia.<ref name="BRADY10"/> The Resistance against Archadia includes Dalmascan knight Vossler, an ally of Basch; Marquis Halim Ondore IV, the game's [[narrator]] and ruler of the skycity Bhujerba; Reddas, a sky pirate based in the port at Balfonheim; and the Rozarrian Empire, of which Al-Cid Margrace is a prince of the ruling family.<ref name="BRADY10"/> The mythos of ''Final Fantasy XII'' revolves around a character known as Dynast-King Raithwall, the man who once united Ivalice to create the Galtean Alliance.

Basch was initially meant to be the main character of the story, but the focus was eventually shifted to Vaan and Penelo when the two characters were created later in development.<ref name="FrenchInterview" /> The development team explained that their previous game, ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', which featured a "strong man in his prime" as the protagonist had been unsuccessful and unpopular; the change regarding ''Final Fantasy XII'' from a "big and tough" protagonist to a more effeminate one was thus decided after targeting demographics were considered. With the casting of [[Japanese television drama|dorama]] actor [[:ja:武田航平|Kouhei Takeda]] for the voice acting and motion capture, Vaan nevertheless became a little less feminine and more "active, upbeat bright and positive" than planned.<ref name="FrenchInterview">{{cite web | author=Final Fantasy Ring Staff| year=[[February 28]], [[2007]]| title=Sortie française de ''Final Fantasy XII'' : le Compte rendu| format= | work=ffring.com | url=http://www.ffring.com/articles/divers-sortie-francaise-de-Final-Fantasy-XII.html | language=French | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref><ref name="Q&A1">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff| year=[[November 20]], [[2003]]| title=Final Fantasy XII Q&A (page 1 of 4)| format= | work=IGN.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441293p1.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> Comments were made about the similarity between main character designer and background design supervisor [[Akihiko Yoshida]]'s creations and those of [[Tetsuya Nomura]], another Square Enix character designer.

===Story===
''Final Fantasy XII''  begins in Dalmasca's capital city of Rabanastre, where the happiness from the union of Princess Ashe of Dalmasca and Prince Rasler of Nabradia is interrupted by the Archadian Empire's invasion of Dalmasca. In the subsequent war, Nabradia and Dalmasca are subjugated by Archadia; among the lives lost is Prince Rasler. The Dalmascan king, Raminas, who is forced to sign a treaty of surrender, is slated to be assassinated.<ref>'''Ondore''': The King had scarce departed His Royal City of Rabanastre when the Remnants of the Order made their Return.

The treason of Basch, and Ashe's eventual suicide, are announced by Marquis Ondore.<ref>'''Ondore''': Prayer, too, for the noble Princess Ashe, who, wrought with Grief at her Kingdom’s Defeat, has taken her own Life.

King Raminas, has been found Guilty of High Treason and put to his Death. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>

Two years later, Vaan, Reks's younger brother, infiltrates the Rabanastre palace during the dinner to celebrate the appointment of Vayne as Consul, despite Penelo's objection. During the infiltration, Vaan encounters Balthier and Fran, who introduce him to magicite. Their escape attempt backfires when Resistance forces storm the palace, landing them into the sewers where they stumble upon the Resistance leader, Amalia. However, Vaan, Balthier and Fran are captured by the Archadians and detained at the Nalbina Dungeons. In Nalbina, the trio encounters Basch and learns of the existence of his twin, Judge Magister Gabranth, and eventually escape with him. Basch conveys to Vaan that Gabranth had posed as him to blackmail Ondore.<ref>'''Basch''': Just the opposite. Reks was the witness they needed.

Ghis takes Vaan's magicite - the Dusk Shard - to be sent to Archadia.

Now unable to use the Shard, Larsa convinces Ashe to seek Gran Kiltias Anastasis, who lives in Mt. Bur-Omisace, for his approval of her as queen of Dalmasca.<ref>'''Larsa''': Lady Ashe, let us go to Bur-Omisace.

[[Image:Gambits-ffxii.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The gambit screen can change how a character will act in different scenarios.]]
The desire to move away from [[random encounter]]s was present since the beginning of development.<ref name="itointerview">Interview with Hiroyuki Itō{{cite video | year=2006 | title=Final Fantasy XII Collector's Edition Bonus DVD | medium=DVD | publisher=Square Enix | location=Tokyo | accessdate=2006-03-10}}</ref> This desire fueled the transition to the "active dimension battle" system so players could seamlessly move from battle to exploration.

At the early stages of development, Minagawa revealed that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling for a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the physical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.<ref>{{cite web | author=Nickel, Thomas | year=2006 | title=Interview with Hiroshi Minagawa | format= | work=g-wie-gorilla.de | url=http://www.g-wie-gorilla.de/content/view/170/18/ | accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>

On [[March 16]], [[2006]], ''Final Fantasy XII''  became the sixth game to receive a 40/40 score from the Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'', making it the first ''Final Fantasy'' game and the first PlayStation 2 title to do so. It is also the second Yasumi Matsuno title to garner a perfect score, the first being ''[[Vagrant Story]]''. The game was praised for its graphics, scenarios, game system, and the freshness it brought to the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name="famitsu">{{cite web | author=Lumb, Jonathan| date=2006-03-08| title=FF XII Scores Perfect In Famitsu| format= | work=1up.com | url=http://1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3148658 | accessdate=2006-08-13}}</ref> The game was critically acclaimed by many reviewers outside of Japan even before its release in those territories.

Although GameSpot lauded the gambit and license systems as an innovative and in-depth way for the player to control the characters, it criticized them for being too complicated and difficult to adjust to, especially for newer players of the series. The reviewer also criticized the sometimes tedious back and forth travel.<ref name="Gamespotreview"/> On the other hand, GameSpot took particular note of the "excellent" voice cast.<ref name="Gamespotreview"/> IGN praised the game's rich storyline and artistic direction, shown through its "sheer depth of character". It also assuaged criticism that the gambit system would "let the game play itself", countering that gambits do not function without a player. However, it noted that, while "still extremely strong", ''Final Fantasy XII'' has one of the series' weaker soundtracks.<ref name="IGNreview"/>

Executive producer [[Akitoshi Kawazu]] was pleased by Famitsu's rating but admitted that the game was not perfect; he felt that the storyline did not meet fans' expectations.<ref>{{cite web | author= Wales, Matt | date =2006-10-26 | title=Square Talks Firsts for Final Fantasy XII | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/742/742013p1.html | work=IGN.com | accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Kawazu expressed his frustration and regrets regarding the flaws in the storyline, citing creative differences between the [[PlayOnline]] and ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' members of the development team.<ref>{{cite web | author=Verlet, Nicolas | date=2006-10-24 | title=Interview : Akitoshi Kawazu (FF XII) | url=http://www.gamekult.com/articles/A0000052257/ | work=Gamekult.com | accessdate=2007-07-17 | language=French}}</ref>
