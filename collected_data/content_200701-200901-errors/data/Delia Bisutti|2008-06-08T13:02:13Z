'''Delia Beatriz Bisutti''' (b. [[1947-03-31]]) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] centre-left politician, currently a member of the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] representing [[Buenos Aires]].

Bisutti was born in Buenos Aires and became a teacher after studying at the [[Universidad Nacional de Quilmes]]. From an early age she took an active role in trade unions, serving as a union delegate from 1970 to 1989. In 1977, during the [[Dirty War]], she was detained by the military government and imprisoned in the [[concentration camp]] known as the '[[Sheraton]]'. Her husband was also taken and [[disappeared]], presumed dead.

In 1989 Bisutti became secretary general of the teacher's union, ''Unión de Trabajadores de la Educación'' (UTE), part of [[CTERA]]. She sat on CTERA's national committee. From 1995 she was a member of the executive of the Buenos Aires left-wing party, the [[Frente Grande]], and in 1997 she was elected to the city legislature for the party as part of [[FrePaSo]], where she presided over several committees including economic development.

Bisutti had been a critic of FrePaSo's alliance with the [[Radical Civic Union]] [http://www.noticiasurbanas.com.ar/politica.shtml?AA_SL_Session=bd5150b1e83da6c38b7f19e5a104e0aa&x=322]. In 2001, she joined the new centre-left party, [[Support for an Egalitarian Republic]] (ARI) and sat on the party's city executive. In 2003 she led the ARI block in the Buenos Aires legislature. Later that year she resigned her seat to take a junior role in the city government, within the education department, serving until January 2005.

Bisutti was elected a deputy for ARI in the [[Elections in Argentina, 2005|October 2005 elections]]. Following ARI's integration into the [[Civic Coalition]] in 2007, Bisutti and a number of her colleagues left the party in protest against ARI's courting of more centrist figures. Initially forming a separate block in Congress known as the Autonomous ARI, in May 2008 they announced the formation of a new party, [[Solidarity and Equality]], ''Si''.<ref>[http://www.parlamentario.com/noticia-14812.html El ARI Autónomo mutó a Solidaridad e Igualdad Sí], parlamentario.com, [[18 May]] [[2008]].</ref>
