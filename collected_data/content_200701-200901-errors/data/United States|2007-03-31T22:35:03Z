The nation was founded by [[thirteen colonies]] declaring their independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] on [[July 4]], [[1776]] as the new nation, the "United States of America."  It adopted the current [[United States Constitution|constitution]] (which has been [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amended]] several times subsequently) on [[September 17]], [[1787]]. The country greatly [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|expanded]] in territory throughout the [[19th century]], acquiring further territory from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], as well as lands from [[France]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]], and [[Russia]]. With the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in [[1991]], it became the world's sole remaining [[superpower]], and is a [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|declared nuclear weapons state]].  The United States continues to exert dominant economic, political, cultural and military influence around the globe.<ref>[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20040701faessay83406/eliot-a-cohen/history-and-the-hyperpower.html History and the Hyperpower by Eliot A.

==Etymology==
Common names and abbreviations of the United States of America include the '''United States''', the '''U.S.''', the '''U.S.A.''', the '''U.S. of A.''', '''the States''' (informal), and '''America''' (colloquially).
The earliest known use of the name ''[[America (disambiguation)|America]]'' is attributed to the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] cartographer [[Martin Waldseemüller]] who, while working in [[Saint-Dié-des-Vosges]] in 1507, created a globe and a large map showing North and South America.<ref>The Waldseemüller map [http://bell.lib.umn.edu/map/WALD/WALL/indexww.html] labeled North America as "terra incognita" ([http://bell.lib.umn.edu/map/WALD/WALL/north.html closeup]) and South America as "America." ([http://bell.lib.umn.edu/map/WALD/WALL/south.html closeup]) The map does not show the continents to be connected. ([http://bell.lib.umn.edu/map/WALD/WALL/lgwall.html closeup])</ref> According to the Library of Congress "Waldseemüller christened the new lands "America" in recognition of [[Amerigo Vespucci|Vespucci]]’s understanding that a new continent had been uncovered as a result of the voyages of Columbus and other explorers in the late fifteenth century."<ref name="US Library of Congress, Waldseemüller Map">{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/waldexh.html|title=US Library of Congress, Waldseemüller Map|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

The [[Americas]] were also known as ''[[Historical Columbia|Columbia]],'' after Columbus, prompting the name ''District of Columbia'' for the land set aside as the U.S. capital. ''Columbia'' remained a popular name for the United States until the early 20th century, when it fell into relative disuse; it is still used poetically, and appears in various names and titles.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/home/index.html Space Shuttle Columbia]. [[NASA]]. ''URL accessed [[December 9]], [[2006]].''</ref><ref>[http://www.reelclassics.com/Studios/Columbia/columbia.htm Columbia Pictures]. Reel Classics. ''URL accessed [[December 9]], [[2006]].''</ref> One female [[National personification|personification]] of the country is called ''Columbia''.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cocoon/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200000004/default.html Columbia the Gem of the Ocean]. Patriotic Melodies (The [[Library of Congress]]). ''URL accessed [[December 9]], [[2006]].''</ref>

The phrase "United States of America" was first used officially in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], adopted on [[July 4]], [[1776]]. On [[November 15]], [[1777]], the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first of which stated "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'" The name was originally proposed by [[Thomas Paine]].

The most common [[adjectival]] and [[demonym]]ic form for the United States is ''[[American (disambiguation)|American]];'' this term is used for U.S. citizens living abroad, and for cultural characteristics ("American language," "American sports") and is rarely (at least not in [[English language|English]]) used to refer to people not connected to the U.S.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the United States}}
The United States is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|world's third or fourth largest country]] by total area, and the third largest by land area alone, after [[Russia]] and [[China]] and just ahead of [[Canada]].<ref>[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/factbook/countrycompare/area/3d.html;_ylt=As1XMsN8kgSx746VWazy_s7PecYF]. [[28 February]] [[2007]]. CIA World Factbook. ''URL accessed [[28 February]] [[2007]].''</ref> Its [[Continental United States|contiguous portion]] is bounded by the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, the North [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, [[Mexico]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and Canada to the north. [[Alaska]] (the largest state in area) is bound by Canada to its east, with the Pacific Ocean to its south, the [[Arctic Ocean]] to its north, and the [[Bering Strait]] to the west. The state of [[Hawaii]] occupies an [[archipelago]] in the Pacific Ocean, southwest of the [[North America]]n mainland.

[[Deciduous]] vegetation and [[grassland]]s prevail in the eastern U.S., transitioning to [[prairies]], [[taiga|boreal]] forests, and the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the west, and [[desert]]s in the southwest. In the northeast, the coasts of the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Atlantic seaboard]] host much of the country's population.

===Terrain===
[[Image:MtHood TrilliumLake.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Mount Hood]], a dormant volcano in the [[Pacific Northwest]].]] The U.S. has an extremely varied geography, particularly in the [[Western United States|West]]. The eastern seaboard has a [[coastal plain]] which is widest in the south and narrows in the north. The coastal plain does not exist north of [[New Jersey]], although there are glacial [[outwash]] plains on [[Long Island]], [[Martha's Vineyard]], and [[Nantucket]]. In the extreme southeast, [[Florida]] is home to the ecologically unique [[Everglades]].

Beyond the coastal plain, the rolling hills of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region end at the [[Appalachian Mountains]], which rise above 6,000&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (1,830&nbsp;[[meter|m]]) in [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[New Hampshire]]. From the west slope of the Appalachians, the [[Interior Plains]] of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] are relatively flat and are the location of the [[Great Lakes]] as well as the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]-[[Missouri River]], the world's [[List of rivers by length|4th longest river system]].<ref>[http://www.visitbemidji.com/index.html Mississippi River]. 2004. Visit Bemidji- First City on the Mississippi. ''URL accessed [[May 3]] [[2006]].''</ref> West of the Mississippi River, the Interior Plains slope uphill and blend into the vast and often featureless [[Great Plains]].

The abrupt rise of the [[Rocky Mountains]], at the western edge of the Great Plains, extends north to south across the continental U.S., reaching altitudes over 14,000&nbsp;feet (4,270&nbsp;m) in [[Colorado]].<ref>Peakbagger.com, [http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=21360 Colorado 14,000-foot Peaks], ''URL accessed [[May 3]] [[2006]].''</ref> In the past, the Rocky Mountains had a higher level of volcanic activity; nowadays, the range only has one area of [[volcano|volcanism]] (the [[supervolcano]] underlying [[Yellowstone National Park]] in [[Wyoming]], possibly the world's largest volcano), although [[rift]] volcanism has occurred relatively recently near the Rockies' southern margin in [[New Mexico]].<ref>Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program, [http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/region.cfm?rnum=1210 New Mexico volcanoes], ''URL accessed [[August 26]] [[2006]].''</ref>

Alaska has numerous mountain ranges; including [[Mount McKinley]] (Denali), the highest peak in North America. Numerous volcanoes can be found throughout the [[Alexander Archipelago|Alexander]] and [[Aleutian Islands]] extending south and west of the Alaskan mainland.
[[Image:Climatemapusofa.JPG|thumb|240px|right|Climate zones of the lower 48 United States.]]

The Hawaiian Islands are [[Hawaiian islands|tropical, volcanic islands]] extending over 1,500&nbsp;[[mile]]s (2,400&nbsp;[[kilometer|km]]), and consisting of six larger islands and another dozen smaller ones that are inhabited.

===Climate===
Due to its large size and wide range of geographic features, the United States contains examples of nearly every global climate. The climate is temperate in most areas, tropical in [[Hawaii]] and southern [[Florida]], polar in [[Alaska]], semiarid in the [[Great Plains]] west of the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]], deserts in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal [[California]] and arid in the [[Great Basin]]. Its comparatively generous climate contributed (in part) to the country's rise as a world power, with infrequent [[Drought|severe drought]] in the major agricultural regions, a general lack of widespread flooding, and a mainly [[Temperate|temperate climate]] that receives adequate precipitation.

==History==
{{main|History of the United States}}
===Native Americans===
{{Main|Native Americans in the United States}}
Before the [[European colonization of the Americas]], a process that began at the end of the 15th century, the present-day continental U.S. was inhabited exclusively by various [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]], including [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan natives]], who migrated to the [[North America|continent]] over a period that may have begun 35,000 years ago and may have ended as recently as [[9th millennium BC|11,000 years ago]].<ref>[http://www.si.edu/resource/faq/nmnh/origin.htm "Paleoamerican Origins"]. 1999. [[Smithsonian Institution]]. ''Accessed [[2 May]] [[2006]].''</ref> While the current country declared its independence from Great Britan in 1776, the histories of different U.S. states vary considerably.

===European colonization===
[[Image:MayflowerHarbor.jpg|left|250px|thumb|''The Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor,'' painted by William Halsall, 1882. The [[Mayflower]] transported [[Pilgrims]] to the New World in 1620.]]
The first confirmed European landing in present-day United States territory was by [[Christopher Columbus]], who visited [[Puerto Rico]] on [[November 19]], [[1493]]. Florida was home to the earliest European colonies on the mainland; of these colonies only [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] which was founded by [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]] in 1565 remains.

A hundred or so French fur traders set up small outposts in the [[Great Lakes]] region. A few thousand Spanish settled in [[New Mexico]] and [[California]]. The first successful [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlement was at [[Virginia Colony|Jamestown]], [[Virginia]], in 1607, followed in 1620 by the [[Pilgrims]]' landing at [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts]]. In 1609 and 1617, respectively, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[New Amsterdam|settled]] in part of what became [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. In 1638, the [[Sweden|Swedes]] founded [[New Sweden]], in part of what became [[Delaware]], New Jersey, and [[Pennsylvania]] after passing through Dutch hands. Throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries, England (and later Great Britain) established new colonies, took over Dutch colonies, and split others. Several colonies were used as [[penal colony|penal settlements]] from the 1620s until the American Revolution. With the division of the [[Carolinas]] in 1729, and the colonization of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1732, the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 British colonies]] that became the United States of America in 1776 were established and all had active local and colonial governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self government that stimulated support for [[republicanism]].  By the 1770s the colonies were becoming "Anglicized" (that is, more like England). With high birth rates, low death rates, and steady immigration, the colonies doubled in population every 25 years. By 1770 they had a population of three million, about half as many as Britain itself. However, no representation was allowed them in the British Parliament.

===American Revolution and Early Republic===

{{main|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War}}

Tensions between [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonials]] and the British during the [[American Revolution|revolutionary period]] of the 1760s and 1770s led to open warfare 1775-1781. [[George Washington]] commanded the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) as the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the Declaration of Independence on [[July 4]], [[1776]]. The Congress had been formed to confront British actions and created the Continental Army, but it was handicapped by lack of authority to levy taxes; it printed large amounts of paper money that soon lost value. In 1777, the Congress adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], uniting the states under a weak federal government, which operated until 1788. After the United States defeated Great Britain, dissatisfaction with the weakness of the national government led to a constitutional convention in 1787. By June of 1788, enough states had ratified the [[United States Constitution]] to establish the new government, which took office in 1789. The Constitution, which strengthened the union and the federal government, has since remained the supreme law of the land.<ref>Yanak, Ted and Cornelison, Pam.

===Westward expansion===
{{main|Manifest Destiny}}
[[Image:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|left|176px|thumb|National Atlas map depicting dates of select territorial acquisitions. Full Oregon and other claims are not included.]]
[[Image:US states by date of statehood3.gif|thumb|right|200px|Growth of the United States, by date of statehood, with the original 13 colonies shown in order of accepting the [[Constitution of the United States]].]]
From 1803 to 1848, the size of the new nation nearly tripled as settlers (many embracing the concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] as an inevitable consequence of [[American exceptionalism]]) pushed beyond national boundaries even before the [[Louisiana Purchase]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060518140700/http://eps.berkeley.edu/~brimhall/EPS170AC_LNS170AC/L-20.pdf Manifest Destiny- An interpretation of How the West was Won]. Crossroads of Earth Resources and Society. URL accessed on [[4 May]] [[2006]].</ref> The expansion was tempered somewhat by the stalemate in the [[War of 1812]], but it was subsequently reinvigorated by victory in the [[Mexican-American War]] in [[1848]].

Between 1830–1880 up to 40 million [[American Bison|American Buffalo]] were slaughtered for skins and meat, and to aid railway expansion. The expansion of the railways reduced transit times for both goods and people, made [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]] less arduous for the pioneers, and increased conflicts with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] over the land and its uses. The loss of the [[bison|buffalo]], a primary resource for the plains Indians, added to the pressures on native cultures and individuals for survival.

===Civil War===
[[Image:Battle of Gettysburg, by Currier and Ives.png|thumb|right|250px|The ''[[Battle of Gettysburg]]'' color lithograph by [[Currier & Ives]], c. 1863. This battle was a major turning point of the [[American Civil War]]. The victory of the Union kept the country united.]]
{{main|American Civil War}}
As new territories were being incorporated, the nation was divided over the issue of [[states' rights]], the role of the federal government, and &mdash; by the 1820s &mdash; the expansion of [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]], which had been legal in all thirteen colonies but was rarer in the north, where it was abolished by 1804. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Northern states]] were opposed to the expansion of slavery whereas the Southern states saw the opposition as an attack on their [[way of life]], since their economy was dependent on slave labor. The failure to permanently resolve these issues led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], following the secession of many [[slave state]]s in the South to form the [[Confederate States of America]] after the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Morrison, Michael A ''Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War''. Page 176. [[University of North Carolina]] Press. ISBN 0-8078-4796-8.</ref> The 1865 Union victory in the Civil War effectively ended slavery and settled the question of whether a state had the right to secede.

''The Politics of Dissolution: The Quest for a National Identity and the American Civil War''. Page 266. Transaction Publishers: [[1 January]] [[1997]]. ISBN 1-56000-349-9</ref>

===Reconstruction and industrialization===
[[Image:Ellis island 1902.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Immigrants landing at [[Ellis Island]]]]
{{main|Reconstruction}}
After the Civil War, an unprecedented influx of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] hastened the country's rise to [[Power in international relations|international power]]. These immigrants helped to provide labor for American industry and create diverse communities in [[American Old West|undeveloped areas]] together with high tariff protections, national infrastructure building and national banking regulations. The growing power of the United States enabled it to acquire new territories, including the annexation of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Philippines]] after victory in the [[Spanish-American War]],<ref>Spielvogel, Jackson J. ''Western Civilization: Volume II: Since 1500''. Page 708. Wadsworth Publishing: [[10 January]] [[2005]]. ISBN 0-534-64604-2</ref> which marked the debut of the United States as a [[Great power|major world power]].

===World Wars I and II===
[[Image:Dallas South Dakota 1936.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An abandoned farm in South Dakota during [[the Great Depression]], 1936. [[Farm Security Administration]] photography by Sloan.]]
{{main|World War I|World War II}}
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the United States remained neutral. In 1917, however, the United States joined the [[Triple Entente|Allied Powers]], helping to turn the tide against the [[Central Powers]]. For historical reasons, American sympathies were very much in favor of the British and French, even though a sizable number of citizens, mostly Irish and German, were opposed to intervention.<ref>Eric Foner and [[John A. Garraty]], ''The Reader's Companion to American History.'' Page 576. [[21 October]] [[1991]]. Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0-395-51372-3.</ref> After the war, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] did not ratify the [[Treaty of Versailles]] because of a fear that it would pull the United States into European affairs. Instead, the country continued to pursue its policy of [[unilateralism]] that bordered at times on [[isolationism]].<ref>McDuffie, Jerome, Piggrem, Gary Wayne, and Woodworth, Steven E. ''U.S. History Super Review''. Page 418. Research & Education Association: [[21 June]] [[2005]]. ISBN 0-7386-0070-9</ref>

During [[Roaring Twenties|most of the 1920s]], the United States enjoyed a period of unbalanced prosperity as farm prices fell and industrial profits grew. A rise in debt and an inflated [[stock market]] culminated in a [[Stock market crash|crash]] in 1929, and combined with the [[Dust Bowl]], triggered the [[Great Depression]]. After his election as [[President of the United States|President]] in 1932, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] instituted his plan for a [[New Deal]], which increased [[Public sector|government intervention]] in the economy in response to the Great Depression.

The nation did not fully recover until 1941, when the United States was driven to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] against the [[Axis Powers]] after a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by [[Japan]].

===Cold War and civil rights===
{{main|Cold War|American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)}}
After World War II, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] became superpowers in an era of ideological rivalry dubbed the [[Cold War]]. The United States officially promoted [[liberal democracy]] and [[capitalism]], while the Soviet Union officially promoted [[communism]] and a centrally [[planned economy]]. Both sides sometimes supported politically convenient oppressive regimes. The result was a series of [[proxy war]]s, including the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], the tense nuclear showdown of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]].

The perception that the United States was losing the [[space race]] spurred government efforts to raise proficiency in mathematics and science in schools<ref name="Rudolph">Rudolph, John L. ''Scientists in the Classroom: The Cold War Reconstruction of American Science Education.'' Page 1. Palgrave Macmillan: [[3 May]] [[2002]]. ISBN 0-312-29571-5.</ref> and led to President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call for the United States to land "a man on the [[moon]]" by the end of the 1960s, which was realized in 1969.<ref name="Rudolph">Rudolph, John L. ''Scientists in the Classroom: The Cold War Reconstruction of American Science Education.'' Page 1. Palgrave Macmillan: [[3 May]] [[2002]]. ISBN 0-312-29571-5.</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Culture of the United States|American society]] experienced a period of sustained economic expansion. At the same time, discrimination across the United States, especially in the South, was increasingly challenged by a growing [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil-rights movement]] headed by prominent [[African American]]s such as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], which led to the abolition of the [[Jim Crow laws]] in the South.<ref>Klarman, Michael J. ''From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality.'' Page 552. [[Oxford University Press]], USA: [[4 May]] [[2006]]. ISBN 0-19-531018-7.</ref>

After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the United States continued to intervene in overseas military conflicts such as the [[Gulf War]]. It remains the world's only superpower.

===War on Terrorism===
{{main|September 11, 2001 attacks|War on Terror}}
After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks of September&nbsp;11, 2001]], which killed nearly 3,000 people, [[Foreign relations of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] focused on the global threat of [[terrorism]], and the government under President [[George W. Bush]] began a series of military and legal operations termed the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]. It began with [[military operation]]s in [[Afghanistan]] which led to the removal of the [[Taliban]] from power and the attempted expulsion of the terrorist organization [[al-Qaeda]]. The administration formed a preemptive policy against threats to U.S. security known as the [[Bush Doctrine]].

In his [[2002]] [[State of the Union]] address, President George W. Bush labeled [[North Korea]], [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] the "[[axis of evil]]," and stated that these countries "constitute a grave threat to the security of the U.S. and its allies." Later that year, the Bush administration began to press for [[regime change]] in [[Iraq]], and in 2003, the United States and its allies [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded Iraq]], removing [[Saddam Hussein]] from power, but igniting [[Civil war in Iraq|sectarian civil strife]].

==Government and politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Federal government of the United States|Politics of the United States}}
[[Image:USCapitol.jpg|thumb|250px|right|West Front of the [[United States Capitol]].]]
===Political system===
The United States is the world's oldest surviving [[federation]]. Its government relies on [[representative democracy]] through a [[congressional system]] under a set of powers specified by its [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], which was a replacement of the original constitution, the Articles of Confederation, which was in effect from 1781-1788. However, it is "not a simple representative democracy, but a [[constitutional republic]] in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law."<ref>Scheb, John M. and John M. II. ''An Introduction to the American Legal System''. ISBN 0-7668-2759-3. Delmar Publishers. 2002. p. 6</ref> Citizens are usually subject to three levels of government, at federal, state, and local levels, although most areas are subject to multiple local governments, such as county or metropolitan governments in addition to municipal government. Officials at all three levels are either elected by voters in a [[secret ballot]] or appointed by other [[Official|elected officials]]. Executive and legislative offices are decided by a [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]] of citizens in their respective districts, with judicial and cabinet-level offices nominated by the Executive branch and approved by the Legislature. In some states, judicial posts are filled by popular election rather than executive appointment.

The federal government comprises three branches, which are designed to [[checks and balances|check and balance]] one another's powers:
* [[legislature|Legislative]]: The [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], made up of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which makes [[federal law]], declares war, approves treaties and has powers of [[impeachment]] and [[power of the purse|the purse]].
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of the United States|President]], who appoints, with Senate approval, the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and other officers, who administers and enforces federal law, can veto bills, and is [[Commander-in-Chief|Commander in Chief]] of the military.
* [[Judiciary]]: The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and lower [[United States federal courts|federal court]]s, whose judges are appointed by the President with Senate approval, which interpret laws and their validity under the Constitution and can overturn laws they deem unconstitutional.

The United States Congress is a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature. The House of Representatives has 435 members, each representing a [[congressional district]] for a two-year term. House seats are [[United States Congressional apportionment|apportioned]] among the [[U.S. state|states]] according to [[population]] every tenth year. Each state is guaranteed at least one representative: seven states have one each; [[California]], the most populous state, has 53. Each state has two senators, elected [[At-Large|at large]] to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every second year.

[[Image:Whitehousetour.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The north side of the White House]]

The [[United States Constitution]] is the supreme legal document in the American system, and serves as a [[social contract]] for the people of the United States, regulating their affairs through government chosen by and populated by the people. All laws and procedures of both state and federal governments are subject to review, and any law ruled by the judicial branch to be in violation of the Constitution is overturned. The Constitution is a living document as it can be amended by a variety of methods, all of which require the approval of an overwhelming majority of the states. The Constitution has been amended 27 times, the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|last time]] in [[1992]].

The Constitution contains a dedication to "preserve [[liberty]]" with a "[[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" and other [[United States Constitution#Amendments|amendments]], which guarantee [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], and [[freedom of the press|the press]]; the [[right to a fair trial]]; [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|the right to keep and bear arms]]; [[universal suffrage]]; and [[Property|property rights]]. However, the extent to which these rights are protected and universal in practice is heavily debated. The Constitution also guarantees to every State "a [[Republic|Republican Form of Government]]". However, the meaning of that guarantee has been only slightly explicated.<ref>http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/article04/</ref>

American politics is dominated by the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic Party]]. Members of these two parties hold the overwhelming majority of elected offices across the country at federal, state, and lower levels. Independent or so-called "third party" candidates tend to do better in lower-level elections, although there are presently some independent members of the Senate. Within American political culture the Republican Party is considered "center-right" or [[Conservatism|conservative]] while the Democratic Party is considered "center-left" or [[liberal]]. The size of both parties has allowed for considerable divergence of views within both parties.

Since 2001, the President has been [[George W. Bush]], a Republican. Following the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]], the Democratic Party holds a majority of seats in both the House and Senate for the first time since 1994, except for a Democratic plurality in the Senate in 2001–02.<ref>Secretary of the Senate.

The United States has vast economic, political, and military influence on a global scale, which makes its foreign policy a subject of great interest and discussion around the world. Almost all countries have [[List of Washington, D.C. embassies|embassies]] in Washington, D.C., and [[Consul (representative)|consulates]] around the country.

==Administrative divisions==
{{United States and Census Regions Labelled Map|float=right}}
{{main|Political divisions of the United States}}

The United States of America consists of 50 [[U.S. state|states]] and one [[Capital districts and territories#United States|federal district]], the [[District of Columbia]]. The conterminous forty-eight states — all the states but [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] — are also called the [[continental United States|contiguous United States]] or the "lower 48" and occupy much of central North America. Alaska is separated from the contiguous U.S. by Canada; together, they comprise the continental United States. Hawaii, the fiftieth state, is situated in the Pacific.

The map on the right presents the 50 states, additional [[insular area|territories]] and highlights the United States census regions of them. The [[District of Columbia]] is not shown.

In addition to those territories labelled on the map, the United States also holds several other territories. [[Palmyra Atoll]] is the United States' only [[incorporated territory]]; but it is [[Unorganized territory|unorganized]] and uninhabited. The [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]] consist of uninhabited islands and [[atoll]]s in the Pacific and [[Caribbean Sea]]. In addition, since 1898, the United States Navy has held an extensive [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|naval base]] at [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantánamo Bay]], [[Cuba]].

In addition to the actual states and territories of the United States, there are also nations which are [[associated state]]s of the U.S. The [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (since 1986), the [[Marshall Islands]] (since 1986), and [[Palau]] (since 1994) are associated with the United States under what is known as the [[Compact of Free Association]], giving the states international sovereignty and ultimate control over their territory. However, the governments of those areas have agreed to allow the United States to provide defense and financial assistance.

==Environment==
[[Image:Haliaeetus leucocephalus2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[Bald Eagle]] appears on the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. Protection of this once [[endangered species]] has helped save it from extinction.]]
The U.S. has over 17,000 identified native plant and tree species, including 5,000 just in [[California]] (which is home to the [[Sequoia|tallest]], the [[Sequoiadendron|most massive]], and the [[Bristlecone pine|oldest]] trees in the world).<ref>Morse, Larry E., et al, [http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/j085.htm Native Vascular Plants], ''Our Living Resources, U.S. Department of the Interior'', ''URL accessed [[14 June]] [[2006]].''</ref> With habitats ranging from [[tropical]] to [[arctic]], the [[flora]] of the U.S. is the most diverse of any country; yet, thousands of non-native [[exotic species]] sometimes adversely affect indigenous [[plant]] and [[animal]] communities. Over 400 [[species]] of [[mammal]], 700 species of [[bird]], 500 species of [[reptile]] and [[amphibian]], and 90,000 species of [[insect]] have been documented.<ref>National Biological Service, [http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/index.htm Our Living Resources], ''URL accessed [[14 June]] [[2006]].''</ref> Many plants and animals are very localized in their distribution, and some are in danger of [[extinction]]. The U.S. passed the [[Endangered Species Act]] in 1973 to protect native plant and animal species and their [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s.

Conservation has a long history in the U.S.; in [[1872]], the world's first [[National Park]] was established at [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]]. Another 57 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks and forests have since been designated.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/applications/release/Detail.cfm?ID=639 National Park Service Announces Addition of Two New Units], ''National Park Service News release'' (28 [[February 2006]]), ''URL accessed [[13 June]] [[2006]].''</ref> In some parts of the country, [[wilderness]] areas have been established to ensure long-term protection of pristine habitats. The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] monitors [[endangered species|endangered]] and [[threatened species]] and has set aside numerous areas for species and habitat preservation. Altogether, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] regulates 1,020,779 square miles (2,643,807&nbsp;km²), which is 28.8% of the total land area of the U.S.<ref>Republican Study Committee, [http://johnshadegg.house.gov/rsc/Federal%20Land%20Ownership--May%202005.pdf Federal Land and Buildings Ownership], (19 [[May 2005]]), ''URL accessed [[13 June]] [[2006]].''</ref> The bulk of this land is protected park and forestland, but some is leased for [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] exploration, [[mining]], and cattle ranching.

The United States was, [[as of 2005]], the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.<ref>{{cite web | title=United States Country Analysis Brief | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Usa/Full.html | date=2005 | accessmonthday=December 5 | accessyear=2006| publisher=US Energy Information Administration}}</ref>

The [[economic system]] of the United States can be described as a [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[mixed economy]]. While private organization constitute the bulk of the economy, government activity accounts for 36% of the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP).

Since 1975, the U.S. has a "two-tier" [[Labor economics|labor market]] in which virtually all the [[real income]] gains have gone to the top 20% of households, with most of those gains accruing to the very highest earners within that category.<ref>[[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Econ Economy]].

===Socio-economic class===
{{main|Social class in the United States|American upper class|American middle class|American lower class}}
While the [[Social class in the United States|social class structure]] of the United States remains a vaguely defined concept, [[sociology|sociologists]] point to social class as the perhaps most important societal variable.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus

Social mobility is another issue of debate, especially when attempting to conduct international comparisons. While some analysts have found the US to have a relatively low social mobility compared to [[Western Europe]] and Canada,<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3518560 "Ever Higher Society, Ever Harder to Ascend: Whatever Happened to the Belief That Any American Could Get to the Top"] [[The Economist]].

===Innovation===
{{main|United States technological and industrial history|Science and technology in the United States}}
[[Image:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] takes off on a manned mission to space.]]
The United States is an influential country in scientific and technological research and the production of innovative technological products. The bulk of Research and Development funding (69%) comes voluntarily from the private sector, rather than from taxation.<ref>http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/science_technology/science.pdf Research and Development (R&D) Expenditures by Source and Objective: 1970 to 2003], U.S. National Science Foundation.</ref> During World War II, the U.S. led the Allied program to develop the [[atomic bomb]], ushering in the [[atomic age]]. Beginning early the Cold War, as a response to [[USSR]]'s space program, the U.S. pursued a wide and successful space program of its own. This competition between the two superpowers, dubbed the [[Space Race]], led to rapid advances in [[rocketry]], [[material science]], [[computers]], and many other areas. The U.S. was also the most instrumental nation in the development of the Internet, developing its predecessor, [[Arpanet]]. The U.S. also controls much of its infrastructure.

===Transportation===
{{main|Transportation in the United States}}
The United States is home to a variety of [[freeway]] and [[highway]] systems, multiple large international airports as well as an extensive freight rail network. The automobile industry developed early and more rapidly in the United States. As the largest developed nation, the US is home to more roadways that any other country in the world.<ref>[[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2085rank.html Rank Order- Roadways]]. [[20 April]] [[2006]]. CIA World Factbook. Accessed [[30 April]] [[2006]].</ref> While mass transit systems are commonplace in some large cities, these systems tend to be less extensive than in other developed nations.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2121rank.html</ref>

[[Air travel]] is the preferred [[mode of transport]] for long distances. In terms of passengers, seventeen of the world's thirty busiest [[airports]] in 2004 were in the U.S., including the world's busiest, [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield – Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] (ATL). In terms of cargo, in the same year, twelve of the world's thirty busiest airports were in the U.S., including the world's busiest, [[Memphis International Airport]]. The airline industry is privately owned, however most [[airport]]s are government owned.

Several major [[seaport]]s are in the United States, on the east, west and gulf coasts.<ref> http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104779.html Rank Order- Seaports]. Infoplease.com</ref> The interior of the U.S. also has major [[Channel (geography)|shipping channels]], via the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] and the Mississippi River. The first water link between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic, the [[Erie Canal]], allowed the rapid expansion of agriculture and industry in the Midwest and made New York City the economic center of the country.

===Indigenous peoples===
{{Main|Native Americans in the United States}}

The [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] gave [[United States nationality law|United States citizenship]] to Native Americans, in part because of an interest by many to see them merged with the American mainstream, and also because of the service of many Native American veterans in the [[First World War]].

According to the 2003 census estimates, there are 2,786,652 Native Americans in the United States.

{{main|Religion in the United States}}
The United States government keeps no official register of Americans' religious status.<ref>http://www.census.gov/prod/www/religion.htm</ref> However, in a private survey conducted in 2001 and mentioned in the Census Bureau's ''Statistical Abstract of the United States'', 76.7% of American adults identified themselves as [[Christian]]; about 52% of adults described themselves as members of various [[Protestant]] denominations. [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Roman Catholics]], at 24.5%, were the most populous individual denomination. The most popular other faiths include [[Judaism]] (1.4%), [[Islam in the United States|Islam]] (0.5%), [[Buddhism]] (0.5%), [[Hinduism]] (0.4%) and [[Unitarian Universalism]] (0.3%).<ref>[http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm American Religious Identification Survey], CUNY Graduate Center ARIS 2001.</ref> About 14.2% of respondents described themselves as having no religion. The religious distribution of the 5.4% who elected not to describe themselves for the survey (up from 2.3% in 1990) is unknown. While the total U.S. population grew by 18.5% between 1990 and 2001, 13 religious groups declined in absolute numbers, while 20 groups more than doubled in number.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0073.xls Self-Described Religious Identification of Adult Population: 1990 and 2001].

===Education===
[[Image:RotundaII.jpg|225px|right|thumb|The [[University of Virginia]], designed and founded by [[Thomas Jefferson]], is one of 19 [[World Heritage Site]]s in the United States and one of many highly regarded universities supported by the [[U.S. state|state]] level of government.]]
{{main|Education in the United States|Educational attainment in the United States}}
[[Education in the United States]] is a combination of public and private entities. Public education is the responsibility of state and local governments, rather than the federal government. The [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] of the federal government, however, exerts some influence through its ability to control funding. Students are generally obliged to attend school starting with [[kindergarten]], and ending with the [[Twelfth grade|12th grade]], which is normally completed at age 18, but many states may allow students to drop out as early as age 16. Besides [[public school]]s, parents may also choose to educate their own children at [[homeschooling|home]] or to send their children to [[parochial school|parochial]] or [[private school]]s. After [[high school]], most graduates voluntarily go on to community colleges, state colleges, private colleges, universities, or proprietary (for profit) trade schools. Each of these charges tuition (ranging from $1000 a year to around $40,000 a year).

[[Image:Stanford University Hoover Tower.JPG|155px|thumb|left|[[Stanford University]], one of many renowned private universities in the U.S.]]

Public universities receive part of their funding from the [[U.S. state|state]] governments. Alumni donations and other sources also contribute large amounts of funding to both public and private universities, and most of the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|top university endowments]] in the world are owned by universities in the United States. Many students take out low-interest [[student loan]]s that they are required to pay back after graduation (the interest paid on such loans is [[tax deduction|tax deductible]]). Tuition at private universities is generally much higher than at public universities.

There are many competitive [[List of colleges and universities in the United States|institutions of higher education]] in the United States, both private and public. The United States has 168 universities in the world's top 500, 17 of which are in the top 20.<ref>[http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2005/ARWU2005Statistics.htm ARWU2005 Statistics] by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Shanghai Jiao Tong university]]. URL accessed on 05 October 2006</ref> There are also many smaller universities and [[liberal arts]] colleges, and local [[community college]]s of varying quality across the country with open admission policies.

The United Nations assigned an Education Index of 99.9 to the United States, ranking it number 1 in the world, a position it shares with about 20 other nations.<ref name=undp>{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2005/pdf/HDR05_HDI.pdf |title=Human development indicators |accessdate = 2006-11-07 |format=PDF |work=United Nations Development Programme, Human Development Reports}}</ref> The United States has a basic [[literacy rate]] at 98%<ref name=EDU>[http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/PDF/2006470.PDF A First Look at the Literacy of America’s Adults in the 21st Century], U.S. Department of Education, 2003.

As for [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], 27.2% of the population aged 25 and above have earned a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher, and 84.6% have graduated high school.<ref name="Educational attainment according to the US Census Bureau, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-550.pdf|title=Educational attainment according to the US Census Bureau, 2003|accessdate = 2006-08-01}}</ref>

===Health===
{{main|Health care in the United States}}
The overall performance of the United States [[health care system]] was ranked 15th by the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/annex09_en.pdf "Overall Health system attainment in all Member States] 1997. World Health Organization.

The University of Main. Accessed [[29 November]] [[2006]].</ref>. This spending has not correlated with a high ranking in many public health metrics. The [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] indicates that the United States has a higher [[infant mortality]] rate and slightly lower [[life expectancy]] than some other post-industrial western nations such as [[Sweden]],<ref name="CIA Factbook, Sweden health">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sw.html#People|title=CIA Factbook, [[Sweden]] health|accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref> [[Germany]]<ref name="CIA factbook, Germany health">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gm.html#People|title=CIA factbook, Germany health|accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref> or [[France]].<ref name="CIA factbook, France health">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/fr.html#People|title=CIA factbook, France health|accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref><ref name="CIA factbook, US health">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#People|title=CIA factbook, US health|accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref> The average salary of a physician in the US is the highest in the world.<ref>[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/3/169?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=cross-national+comparison&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT]</ref> [[Obesity]] is a [[public health]] problem, estimated to cost tens of [[1000000000 (number)|billions]] of dollars annually.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3418603.stm "Obesity cost US $75bn, says study" by Jannat Jalil]. [[21 January]] [[2004]]. ''BBC''. Retrieved on [[5 October]] [[2006]].</ref>

Unlike some other Western countries, the U.S. healthcare system is not fully [[publicly funded health care|publicly-funded]], instead relying on a mix of public and private funding. In 2004, private insurance paid for 36% of personal health expenditure, private out-of-pocket payments covered 15%, and federal, state, and local governments paid for 44%.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus06.pdf Health, United States, 2006]. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.</ref>

In 2005, 41.2 million people in the U.S. (14.2 percent of the population) were without healthcare insurance for at least part of that year.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus06.pdf Health, United States, 2006]. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.</ref> Many of these people may have been between jobs for part of the year, which could leave them without coverage as health insurance is often provided as a benefit of employment. Not all those without insurance were unable to afford it — approximately one third of the 41.2 million who were without insurance for part of the year lived in households with annual incomes over $50,000, with half of these having an income of over $75,000.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/hlthin05.html Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2005.] U.S. Census Bureau.</ref> Presumably some of these people chose not to purchase insurance, for example because they perceived themselves as being at low risk of serious illness. Another third of the 41.2 million were eligible for public health insurance programs but had not signed up for them.<ref>Dr. David Gratzer, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Interviewed in the Sun, in the article [http://www.nysun.com/article/46304?page_no=1 Momentum Grows on Health Care].</ref> This leaves substantially fewer than 41.2 million people who were without access to healthcare insurance because they could not afford to purchase it privately. Although [[Emergency department|emergency care facilities]] are required to provide service regardless of the patient's ability to pay, medical bills remain the most common reason for personal [[bankruptcy]] in the United States.<ref>[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.w5.63/DC1 "Illness And Injury As Contributors To Bankruptcy"], by David U. Himmelstein, [[Elizabeth Warren]], Deborah Thorne, and Steffie Woolhandler, published at Health Affairs journal in 2005, ''Accessed 05 October 2006''.</ref>

The nation spends a substantial amount on [[medical research]], mostly privately-funded. As of 2000, non-profit private organizations funded 7% (such as the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]), private industry funded 57%, and the tax-funded [[National Institutes of Health]] funded 36% of medical research in the U.S.<ref>[http://hsc.utoledo.edu/research/nih_research_benefits.pdf The Benefits of Medical Research and the Role of the NIH].</ref> As of 2003, the NIH funded 28% of medical research funding; funding by private industry increased 102% from 1994 to 2003.<ref name="Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade"> [http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/tb/1767 Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade], Neil Osterweil, [[MedPage Today]], [[September 20]] [[2005]]</ref>

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of the United States}}
[[Image:Elvis presley.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Elvis Presley]] in 1957]]
The United States is a diverse and multicultural nation, home to a wide variety of ideologies, customs and ethnic groups.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA | id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref><ref name="Dealing with Diversity">{{cite book | last =Adams | first =J.Q. | authorlink = | coauthors =Pearlie Strother-Adams | year =2001 | title =Dealing with Diversity | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company | location =Chicago, IL |id = 0-7872-8145-X}}</ref> Mainstream American culture evolved from that of colonial Dutch and English settlers and later became a melting pot of various European cultures. [[Culture of England|English]], [[German culture|German]], and [[Culture of Ireland|Irish]] cultures and later from Italian, Greek and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Eastern European Jewish]] (Ashkenazi) cultures were the perhaps most significant influences on modern American culture. Descendants of enslaved West Africans preserved some cultural traditions from [[West Africa]] in the early United States. Geographical place names largely reflect the combined English, [[Netherlands|Dutch]], French, German, Spanish, and Native American components of U.S. history.<ref name="Dealing with Diversity">{{cite book | last =Adams | first =J.Q. | authorlink = | coauthors =Pearlie Strother-Adams | year =2001 | title =Dealing with Diversity | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company | location =Chicago, IL |id = 0-7872-8145-X}}</ref>

There are two main theories regarding the current evolution of American culture. In the traditional [[melting pot]], immigrants from other cultures bring unique cultural aspects which are incorporated into the larger American culture and adopt features of the mainstream culture. A more recently articulated model is that of the [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]], in which immigrant cultures retain some of their unique characteristics. Cultures intermingle, forming a [[Mixture|heterogeneous mixture]], not unlike a salad composed of different vegetables.<ref>Joyce Millet, [http://www.culturalsavvy.com/understanding_american_culture.htm Understanding American Culture: From Melting Pot to Salad Bowl].

An important component of American culture is the [[American Dream]]: the idea that, through hard work, courage, and determination, regardless of social class, a person can [[social mobility|gain a better life]].<ref>Boritt, Gabor S. ''Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream''. Page 1. [[1994|December 1994]]. [[University of Illinois Press]]. ISBN 0-252-06445-3.</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{main|Cuisine of the United States}}
[[Image:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|American cultural icons, such as [[apple pie]], [[baseball]], and the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].]]
[[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]] uses Native American ingredients such as [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[potatoes]], [[maize|corn]], and [[squash (fruit)|squash]], which have become integral parts of American culture. Such popular icons as [[apple pie]], [[pizza]], and [[hamburger]]s are either derived from or are actual European dishes. [[Burritos]] and [[taco]]s have their origins in Mexico. [[Soul food]], which originated among [[History of slavery|African slaves]], is popular in the U.S. as well. However, many foods now enjoyed worldwide either originated in the United States or were altered by American cooks.

===Visual arts===
{{main|Visual arts of the United States}}
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Warhol-Marilyns.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Andy Warhol]]'s famous screenprinting of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in the [[1960s]]]] -->
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]] took most of its cues from Europe. Painting, sculpture, and literature looked to Europe as a model, and for approval. By the end of the U.S. Civil War, a more native voice had emerged in [[American literature]]. [[Mark Twain]], [[Emily Dickinson]], and [[Walt Whitman]] all spoke in an American vernacular and voice. Visual art was slower to find its own distinct American expression. The 1913 [[Armory show]] in New York City, an exhibition which brought European modernist artists' work to the U.S., both shocked the public and influenced art making in the United States for the remainder of the twentieth century. The exhibition had a twofold effect of communicating to American artists that art making was about expression, not only aesthetics or [[Realism (arts)|realism]], and at the same time showing that Europe had abandoned its conservative model of ranking artists according to a strict academic hierarchy.

===Literature===
{{main|Literature of the United States}}
Americans have produced much notable literature across genres. The phrase '[[Great American Novel]]' is often used to describe a work which captures the American essence in its narrative. Among some of the masterworks to which this title has been applied are [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', and [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. 

American-born or naturalized citizens have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] twelve times, the most recent winner being [[Toni Morrison]] in 1993.

===Music===
{{main|Music of the United States}}
Music also traces to the country's diverse cultural roots through an array of styles. [[rock music|Rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[soul music|soul]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues|blues]], and [[jazz]] are among the country's most internationally renowned [[genre]]s. Since the late 19th century, popular recorded music from the United States has become increasingly known across the world, such that some forms of American [[popular music]] are heard almost everywhere.<ref>Provine, Rob with Okon Hwang and Andy Kershaw.

===Cinema===
{{main|Cinema of the United States}}
The birth of [[Cinema of the United States|cinema]], as well as its development, largely took place in the United States. In 1878, the first recorded instance of sequential photographs capturing and reproducing motion was [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s series of a [[:Image:The Horse in Motion.jpg|running horse]], which the British-born photographer produced in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[California]], using a row of still cameras. Since then, the American film industry, based in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], [[California]], has had a profound effect on cinema across the world.
