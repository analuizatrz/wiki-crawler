'''''Haunting the Chapel''''' is an [[Extended play|EP]] released by the [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]] in 1984 through [[Metal Blade Records|Metal Blade]] and [[Enigma Records]]. Slayer's debut album ''[[Show No Mercy]]'' became Metal Blade's highest selling, leading to producer [[Brian Slagel]] wanting to release an EP. Recorded in [[Hollywood]] the recording process proved difficult when recording drums in a studio without carpet, although it caused Slayer drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] to meet [[Gene Hoglan]], who influenced his drumming style and speed.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

Although originally featuring three songs, the record evidences a marked evolution from the style of their previous album, ''Show No Mercy'', and is considered the first demonstration of the band's "classic" style displayed on later albums and a "stepping stone".<ref name= "Haunting the Chapel"/> The songs "Captor of Sin" and "Chemical Warfare" are regularly featured on the band's live set list.

==Recording==
Slayer's previous album ''Show No Mercy'' had sold over 40,000 copies worldwide and the band were performing the songs "Chemical Warfare" and "Captor of Sin" live, which made producer [[Brian Slagel]] want to release an [[EP]].<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL">{{cite web

Slayer drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] set his drum kit on the concrete and the kit went "all over the place" while playing. Lombardo asked [[Gene Hoglan]] to hold his kit together, while recording "Chemical Warfare", with Hoglan thinking "I hope he does this in one or two takes, because this is rough."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer">{{cite web| title = An exclusive oral history of Slayer| publisher = Decibel Magazine| url = http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566| accessdate = 2007-04-01 }}</ref> Hoglan was coaching Lombardo how to use [[double-bass]] drums to improve his drumming ability and speed, Lombardo asserts Hoglan was "an amazing double-bass player even back then."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Eddy Schreyer provided [[audio mastering]] and [[digital remastering]], with the covert art design created by Vince Gutierrez.<ref name="Haunting the Chapel credits">{{cite web|title=Haunting the Chapel credits|publisher=All Music Guide|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:k9fqxqu5ldje~T2|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> ''Haunting the Chapel'' was darker and more thrash orientated than ''Show No Mercy'', and laid the groundwork for the future direction in the band's sound.<ref name="About Slayer">{{cite web|title=About Slayer|publisher=Slayer.net|url=http://www.slayer.net/site.php#about|accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref>

==Touring==
Hoglan worked as a [[roadie]] for the band after their lighting guy did not show up one night, and performed Lombardo's [[soundcheck]]s.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Slayer and Hoglan would play [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]] songs during soundchecks, which is how Hoglan eventually joined Dark Angel. Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin: "He came up to me one day and started giving me his criticisms of the band. He said we needed to be more evil. And then he goes, 'By the way, I’m a better drummer than the guy you have in Dark Angel right now.'"<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

Hoglan was fired as he thought a roadie only did lighting, while vocalist [[Tom Araya]]'s brother [[Johnny Araya]] would do all roadie duties, such as moving equipment, working with sound and lights, and setting up the stage.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> The band performed a show in Seattle in front of a crowd of 1500, the largest show they performed at the time, supporting [[Metal Church]], and in Texas played with a band also called Slayer in [[San Antonio]].<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> However it was the San Antonio Slayer's goodbye show.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

==Reception==
Although the EP did not enter any charts, Ed Rivadavia of ''[[All Music Guide]]'' awarded the EP three out of five stars. Rivadavia said ''Haunting the Chapel'' was a "stepping stone" that "offers important clues about this transition period, which saw Slayer's rock-based song structures give way to the non-linear, genre-defining style thereafter regarded as thrash metal's signature sound."<ref name= "Haunting the Chapel">{{cite web

Vocalist [[Karl Willetts]] of the [[death metal]] band [[Bolt Thrower]] asserts the record was an inspiration to the band: "When Slayer's Haunting the Chapel came out I had never heard anything like that before with that style of guitar playing. We were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing. And other bands we heard like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Slaughter (Canadian band)|Slaughter]] and [[Metallica]]. So we took the elements of musicianship from metal and the aggression of punk and poured it all together."<ref name="Karl Willetts of Bolt Thrower">{{cite web
