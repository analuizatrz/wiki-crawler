==Early life and music==
Born in [[Douglas, County Cork|Douglas]], [[County Cork]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name="Premiere 2005 best" /> Murphy is eldest brother to three siblings:<ref name="Strut" /> a brother, Pádraig, and two sisters, Sile and Orla.<ref name="RainbowNetwork Totty">Scott, Richard.

Accessed [[24 July]] [[2007]].</ref> Musicianship also runs in the family, and Murphy started playing music at about age ten.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" />

Murphy attended the Catholic school [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork]], where he did well academically, though he was not keen on sport, a major part of life at the school.<ref name="Independent action hero" /> But it was there that Murphy got his first taste of performing, when at 16, he participated in a drama module presented by Pat Kiernan, the director of the [[Corcadorca Theatre Company]]. Murphy later described the experience as a "huge high" and a "fully alive" feeling that he set out to chase,<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> but said that at this stage, performing meant dreams of becoming a rock star.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" />

In his late teens and early twenties, Murphy worked toward a career as a rock musician, playing guitar in several bands alongside Pádraig.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" /><ref name="TONY 2005">Kaufman, Anthony. [http://www.timeout.com/newyork/article/7462/blue-streak "Blue Streak"], ''Time Out New York'', [[10 November]] [[2005]]. Accessed [[19 July]] [[2007]].</ref> The [[Beatles]]-obsessed brothers named their most successful band The Sons of Mr. Greengenes, after a [[Hot Rats|1969 song]] by another idol, [[Frank Zappa]]. Murphy sang and played guitar. He has said the band "specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos."<ref name="Observer O'Hagan" /> In 1996,<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> The Sons of Mr. Greengenes were offered a five-album record deal by [[Acid Jazz Records]].<ref name="Observer O'Hagan" /> They did not sign the contract, partly because Pádraig was still in secondary school, so their parents did not approve, and partly because the contract offered little money and would have ceded the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" />

Also in 1996, Murphy began studying [[law]] at [[University College Cork]] (UCC), but he failed his first year exams because, as he put it, he had "no ambitions to do it."<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> Not only was he busy with his band,<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" /> but he has admitted that he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was the wrong fit for his artistic personality.<ref name="Electric Mail" /> Also, after seeing Corcadorca's stage production of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'' (directed by Pat Kiernan), acting had begun to pique his interest.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of ''[[Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme]]'', but, according to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women rather than to start an acting career.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" /> Nonetheless, he began to transition away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, "I think there's such a thing as a performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform."<ref name="Independent action hero" />

==Acting career==
===Early work===
[[Image:Cmurphy-discopigs.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Murphy as Darren/"Pig" in ''[[Disco Pigs]]'' (2001)]]
The untrained new actor hounded Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, originating the part of volatile [[Cork (city)|Cork]] teenager Darren/"Pig" in [[Enda Walsh]]'s ''Disco Pigs''.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /><ref name="Irish Playography">[http://www.irishplayography.com/search/play.asp?play_id=304 ''Disco Pigs''], IrishPlayography.com.

Accessed [[19 July]] [[2007]].</ref> and Murphy left university<ref name="Independent action hero" /> and his band.<ref name="TONY 2005" /> Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of ''Disco Pigs'', and his acting career began to take off.<ref name="Back Stage 2005" />

From 1997 to 2003, Murphy starred in [[independent film]]s, such as [[John Carney (director)|John Carney]]'s ''[[On the Edge (film)|On the Edge]]'', in [[short film]]s, including the Irish/English language short ''Filleann an Feall'',<ref name="Fillean">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284109/ ''Filleann an Feall''], IMDb.</ref> and in the [[BBC]] [[miniseries]] adaptation of ''[[The Way We Live Now]]''. In addition to ''Disco Pigs'', he starred in many other plays, including [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', [[Neil LaBute]]'s ''[[The Shape of Things]]'',<ref name="Shape of Things">[http://www.gate-theatre.ie/theshapeofthings.html ''The Shape of Things''], Gate-Theatre.ie. Accessed [[25 June]] [[2007]].</ref> and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]''; Murphy considers this stage work to have been his "training ground."<ref name="Back Stage 2005" /> Murphy also reprised his ''Disco Pigs'' role for the [[Disco Pigs|2001 indie film version]] by Kirsten Sheridan, performing his original song "So New" over the closing credits and singing [[The Kinks]]' "[[You Really Got Me]]" in a [[pub]] [[karaoke]] scene.<ref name="So New">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236157/soundtrack Soundtracks for ''Disco Pigs''], IMDb.</ref> During this period, he moved from Cork, relocating first to [[Dublin]] for a few years,<ref name="Boston Globe 2006" /> then to [[London]] in 2001.<ref name="Blag" />

Murphy's onscreen performance as "Pig" caught the eye of director [[Danny Boyle]] when casting the lead for ''[[28 Days Later]]''.<ref name="Back Stage 2005" /> Released in the U.K. in late 2002, by the following summer ''28 Days Later'' had become a [[sleeper hit]] in [[United States of America|America]]<ref name="Variety Diorio">Diorio, Carl.

In late 2003, Murphy starred as a lovelorn, hapless supermarket stocker who plots a bank heist with [[Colin Farrell]] in ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'', which became the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'' broke the record in 2006).<ref name="RTE press watch">[http://www.rte.ie/business/2006/0808/presswatch.html "Loach Film Sets New Money Mark"], RTE.ie, [[8 August]] [[2006]].

For the latter film, he learned to chop meat in an abattoir to prepare for his role as a butcher, even though he is a vegetarian.<ref name="Irish Tatler">Crewe, Charity.

===Critical success===
[[Image:RedEye05.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Murphy as Jackson Rippner in ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]'' (2005), with [[Rachel McAdams]]]]

2005 was the year that Murphy won wider recognition for two high-profile villain roles, as Dr. Jonathan Crane in blockbuster ''[[Batman Begins]]'', and as Jackson Rippner in the thriller ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. Originally asked to  audition for the role of [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]] in ''Batman Begins'', Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leaped at the chance to connect with director [[Christopher Nolan]].<ref name="Boston Globe 2006" /> Though the lead went to [[Christian Bale]], Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Crane, whose alter ego is [[supervillain]] [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]].<ref name="Back Stage 2005" /> Nolan told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', "He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups."<ref name="Spin 2005">Itzkoff, Dave.

In late 2005 (early 2006 in Europe), Murphy starred as Patrick "Kitten" Braden, a [[transgendered]] Irish orphan in search of his mother, in [[Neil Jordan]]'s [[dramedy]] ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Patrick McCabe]]. Murphy had auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, ''[[The Crying Game]]'' director was hesitant to revisit transgender and [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|I.R.A.]] issues. For several years, Murphy lobbied Jordan to make the film before the actor became too old to play the part. In 2004, Murphy prepared for the role by meeting with a [[transvestite]] who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. Taking notice of the group's quick wit, Murphy attributed it to their constantly having to respond to insults from prejudiced people around them.<ref name="TONY 2005" />

Against ''Breakfast on Pluto''&#39;s kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s [[glitter rock]] fashion, magic shows, red light districts and I.R.A. violence, Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to high [[drag (clothing)|drag]] [[blond bombshell]]. ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Ruthe Stein said of his performance, "Murphy projects enormous energy onscreen, as he's already shown in ''28 Days Later...'' and ''Red Eye''. He's supremely well cast as the androgynous Kitten ... [and] smoothly makes the transition from broad comedy to drama. He delivers Kitten's favorite line, 'Oh serious, serious, serious!' with the full implications of its dual meaning."<ref name="Stein">Stein, Ruthe.

Murphy was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for ''Breakfast on Pluto'' ([[Joaquin Phoenix]] won for ''[[Walk the Line]]''),<ref name="2006 Globes news" /> and won the [[IFTA Award|Irish Film and Television Academy]] Best Actor Award.<ref name="IFTA news">[http://entertainment.aol.co.uk/eva-and-cillian-take-film-accolades/article/20070210035709990004 "Eva and Cillian take film accolades"], AOL Entertainment U.K., [[12 February]] [[2007]]. Accessed [[18 July]] [[2007]].</ref> ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' cited his performance as Kitten in their "The 24 Finest Performances of 2005" feature.<ref name="Premiere 2005 best" /> All three of his 2005 performances were honored by ''Entertainment Weekly'', when they included him in their "Great Performances of 2005" year-end issue.<ref name="EW Great Performances 2005" /> A late 2005 ''Back Stage'' feature labeled Murphy "a chameleonic performer, a character actor trapped in a leading man's bone structure."<ref name="Back Stage 2005" />

In 2006 (2007 in North America), he starred in [[Ken Loach]]'s film about the [[Irish War of Independence]] and [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]], ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="BBC d'Or" /> and became the most successful Irish independent film at the Irish box office, toppling ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'' from the top spot.<ref name="RTE press watch" /> Director Loach, a [[Social Realism|social realist]] who shoots films in sequence, is strict about casting actors from the areas where his films are set, rarely casting well-known faces. Because the film was set in Cork, Murphy was given a chance at the role of Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, but he had to audition six times before winning the part. Murphy's family goes back in Cork for many generations; during the time period in which ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley'' is set, his grandfather was shot at by British soldiers for playing Irish music.<ref name="LAT pale blue eyes" /> 

Critic Denby described Murphy's approach to the part of Damien: "Murphy is normally very quiet in movies; he has attained his mystique as an actor by staring at people with baby-blue eyes. In this film, too, he has, at times, a deep stillness, but he has idiosyncratic moments as well, such as when Damien has to execute a teen-ager who has ratted on the I.R.A. Murphy, writhing, shoots the boy and stumbles away, nausea struggling against duty."<ref name="Denby Barley" /> [[Kenneth Turan]] of ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training."<ref name="Turan on Barley" /> ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' commented, "Cillian Murphy ... exudes a doe-eyed sensitivity that is central to our emotional involvement in the character's development. He is not a macho figure itching for a fight, but a man of peace, reluctantly drawn to the use of force. When he makes a commitment to Irish independence, it is unyielding and entirely believable."<ref name="Scotland on Barley">[http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/review.cfm?id=892002006 "Their Country Right or Wrong"], ''Scotland on Sunday'', [[18 June]] [[2006]].

==Personal life==
Murphy married his long-time<ref name="Strut" /> live-in girlfriend, artist [[Yvonne McGuinness]], in the summer of 2004 in [[Provence]], [[France]]. The couple live in west [[London]], [[England]], with their son Malachy,<ref name="Observer O'Hagan" /> who was born in late 2005.<ref name="TONY 2005" /> Murphy is known for being reluctant to speak about his personal life. He frequently gives interviews about his work but does not do TV [[talk show|chat show]] appearances where actors customarily share information about their private lives.<ref name="Strut" /> He does not have a stylist<ref name="Metro 60 Sec" /> or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage,<ref name="Strut" /> and often attends premieres alone. Shy and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience "a challenge... and not one I want to overcome."<ref name="Hot Press" /> He is friends with fellow Irish actors [[Colin Farrell]]<ref name="Sunday Herald 2005">Didcock, Barry.

Music is still a big part of Murphy's life. In 2004, he said, "The only extravagant thing about my lifestyle is my stereo system, buying music and going to gigs."<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> He no longer plays in a rock band, but regularly plays music with friends and on his own.<ref name="Declan Cashin Independent" /> Unlike many other famous actors who are also musicians, he does not plan to start another band: "Even if I was good, the very notion of being an actor with a rock band on the side would mean I'd never be taken seriously."<ref name="Observer O'Hagan" /> Murphy is also a dedicated [[running|runner]].<ref name="Elle UK">Odell, Michael. "The Cult of Cillian", ''Elle UK'', March 2007.</ref>

Though raised [[Catholic]] before turning [[agnostic]] in his teens, Murphy ultimately became an [[atheist]] after researching his role as a nuclear physicist/astronaut in the [[science fiction]] film ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]''.<ref name="Daily Record Golden Boy">Fulton, Rick.
