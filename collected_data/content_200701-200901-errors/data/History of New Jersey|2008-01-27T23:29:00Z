The written '''history of New Jersey''' began with the exploration of the [[Jersey Shore|Jersey Coast]] by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524, though the region had been settled for millennia by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. At the time of European contact, the area was populated many tribes of [[Lenape]]. The [[New Jersey]] region soon came under the control of the [[Swedes]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] resulting in a struggle in which the Dutch were victorious. However, the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] was seized by the [[England|English]] in 1694. New Jersey was one of the original 13 colonies that joined the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1776. It signed the [[Articles of Confederation]] in 1779 with [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] acting as the nation's capital for four months in 1783. New Jersey became independent after the American Revolutionary War, in which several crucial battles were fought in New Jersey resulting in American victories. In 1787, New Jersey was the third state to ratify the newly drafted [[United States Constitution]].<ref>New Jersey became the third state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]] on [[December 18]], [[1787]], with 38 delegates voting unanimously in favor of the Constitution. See [[Article Seven of the United States Constitution]], which describes the process by which the Constitution was ratified by states, as well as statistics for ratification.</ref> 

In the nineteenth century, New Jersey cities led the nation into the [[Industrial Revolution]] and provided soldiers for many of the wars the United States fought, including 88,000 soldiers for the [[American Civil War]]. The state became a component of the [[Underground Railroad]]. The state's transportation system continued to improve with the construction of canals and more rail lines that helped industrialization further develop. During the early 1900s, New Jersey prospered but weakened in the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s. During [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]] New Jersey's shipyards and military bases played an important role in the defense of the United States. In the 1960s New Jersey was the site of several race riots and of the [[Glassboro Summit Conference]], between American President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and Soviet Premier [[Aleksei Kosygin]].

==Prehistory==
Around 180 million years ago, during the [[Jurassic Period]], New Jersey bordered [[North Africa]]. The pressure of the collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. During this period, [[Pangaea]] broke apart into [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]], and the North American continent became separated from the North African continent. Around 18,000 years ago, the [[Ice Age]] resulted in [[glacier]]s that reached New Jersey. As the glaciers retreated, they left behind [[Glacial Lake Passaic|Lake Passaic]], as well as many rivers, swamps, and gorges.<ref>[http://www.greatswamp.org/GSW/Geology.htm Geological History] by Great Swamp Watershed Association, retrieved [[December 22]], [[2005]]. </ref> 

New Jersey was first settled by a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] group known as the [[Lenape|Lenni-Lenape]], but called the Delaware Indians by European settlers. The Lenape were loosely organized groups that practiced small-scale agriculture (mainly based on [[maize|corn]]) in order to increase their largely mobile hunter-gatherer society in the region surrounding the [[Delaware River]], the lower [[Hudson River]], and western [[Long Island Sound]]. The Lenape society was divided into [[matrilinear]] clans that were based upon common female ancestors. These clans were organized into three distinct [[Phratry|phratries]] identified by their animal sign: [[Turtle]], [[Turkey (bird)|Turkey]], and [[Wolf]]. They first encountered the Dutch in the early 1600s, and their primary relationship with the Europeans was through [[fur trade]].

==Colonial history==
{{main|Colonial history of New Jersey}}
In 1524, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], sailing in the service of [[France]], explored the [[Jersey Shore|Jersey Coast]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shgresources.com/nj/timeline/|title=New Jersey Timeline|accessmonthday=January 10|accessyear=2006|year=2003}}</ref> New Jersey's [[Cape May]] was discovered in 1609 by [[Sir Henry Hudson]] in the service of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/nj/state/NJ-History.htm New Jersey History] by Susan Ditmire, ''American Local History Network'', [[December 6]], [[2005]], retrieved [[December 9]], [[2005]].</ref> Captain [[Cornelius Jacobsen Mey]], a Dutch explorer, also explored the New Jersey and [[Delaware Bay]] area. Cape May was named after Mey, as were the [[Cape May, New Jersey|town]] and [[Cape May County|county]] of the same name.

===New Netherland===
Much of New Jersey was claimed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] before the arrival of the [[Great Britain|British]]. The Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] consisted of parts of modern [[New York]] and New Jersey. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape, Dutch policy required formal purchase of all land settled upon, and the first such purchase was of [[Manhattan]], by [[Peter Minuit]]. The first settlement on land that was to become modern New Jersey was at [[Pavonia (New Netherlands)|Pavonia]] (now [[Jersey City]]) in 1629.<ref>''Words That Make New Jersey History'' edited by Howard L Green, 1995 ISBN 0-8135-2113-0, p. 3</ref> The last Dutch governor was [[Peter Stuyvesant]], who was unpopular with his subjects because he tried to restrict religious freedom: the [[Flushing Remonstrance of 1657]] objected to his ban on [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] as an infringement on the residents as [[Christians]] and as Dutch citizens. Stuyvesant used military coercion in order to accomplish some of his goals, which only made him more disliked. At New Netherland's height, 6,000 inhabitants resided in the colony.<ref>[http://www.netherlands-embassy.org/article.asp?articleref=AR00000380EN New Netherland and After: Dutch Emigration to the U.S.] ([[February 14]], [[2005]]), by Royal Netherlands Embassy, retrieved [[January 10]], [[2006]].</ref>

===New Sweden===
{{main|New Sweden}}
In addition, part of southwestern New Jersey was settled by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] by the mid-17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialswedes.org/History/History.html|title="A Brief History of New Sweden in America"|accessmonthday=December 16|accessyear=2005}}</ref> [[New Sweden]], founded in 1638, rose to its height under governor [[Johan Björnsson Printz]] (1643–1653). Led by Printz, the settlement extended as far north as [[Fort Christina]], on both sides of the [[Delaware River]]. He helped to improve the military and commercial status of the colony by constructing [[Fort Nya Elfsborg]], near present-day [[Salem, New Jersey|Salem]] on the east side of the Delaware River. This action prevented the river from being easily taken by the English and Dutch, who were also trying to expand into the New World. The Swedish and Finnish colonists generally lived in peace with their Dutch and Lenape neighbors. Under the last governor of New Sweden, [[Johan Rising]], the Swedes captured Fort Casimir (now [[New Castle, Delaware]]), which was close to Fort Christina and later named Fort Trinity by the Swedes. 

This action provoked a furious Governor Stuyvesant, who, in revenge, sent seven armed Dutch ships and 317 soldiers to the Delaware River the next summer. Realizing it was hopeless, the outnumbered Swedes surrendered Fort Trinity, and surrendered Fort Christina two weeks later. In 1655, the Dutch completely took over these lands and annexed them to New Netherland.

===Province===
{{main|Province of New Jersey}}
From the colony of New Netherland, the Dutch interfered with Britain's [[transatlantic]] trade with its North American colonies. Insisting that [[John Cabot]] had been the first to discover North America, the British granted the land that now encompasses New Jersey to the [[Duke of York]], who ordered [[Colonel]] [[Richard Nicolls]] to take over the area. In September 1664, a British fleet under Nicolls' command sailed into what is now [[New York Harbor]] and seized the colony. The British encountered little resistance, perhaps due to the unpopularity of the Dutch governor, [[Peter Stuyvesant]].<ref>Stuyvesant's council took several measures restricting religion in New Netherland, heightening his unpopularity, and he was also known for being hot-tempered. He took advantage of military coercion in order to increase his own power, shown in an event with Van Slechtenhorst. Stuyvesant grew haughty in his treatment of his opponents and threatened to dissolve the council in response to an angry outbreak at a meeting of commissioners in September 1650. [http://www.peterstuyvesant.org/ Peter Stuyvesant] StanKlos.com<sup>TM</sup> (2001), retrieved [[December 15]], [[2005]].</ref> After capturing the colony, Nicolls became deputy-governor of [[New Amsterdam]] and the rest of New Netherland, and guaranteed colonists' property rights, laws of inheritance, and the enjoyment of [[religious freedom]]. New Netherland was renamed New Jersey (after the [[English Channel]] Island of [[Jersey]] on which [[Charles II of England]] was proclaimed king in 1649) and [[New Amsterdam]] was renamed [[New York City|New York]] (after the Duke of York).

[[Image:Wpdms_east_west_new_jersey.png|thumbnail|right|225px|The original provinces of West and East New Jersey are shown in yellow and green respectively. The Keith Line is shown in red, and the Coxe and Barclay line is shown in orange]]

Charles II gave the region between [[New England]] and [[Maryland]] to his brother, the Duke of York (later [[James II of England|King James II]]), as a [[proprietary colony]]. Later James granted the land between the [[Hudson River]] and the [[Delaware River]] that would become New Jersey to two friends who had been loyal to him through the [[English Civil War]]: Sir [[George Carteret]] and [[William Berkeley|Lord Berkeley of Stratton]]. The two proprietors of New Jersey tried to entice more settlers to New Jersey by granting land to settlers and by passing [[Concession and Agreement]], a document granting religious freedom to all inhabitants of New Jersey; the British [[Church of England]] allowed no such religious freedom. In return for land, settlers paid annual fees known as quitrents. The proprietors appointed [[Philip Carteret (Governor)|Philip Carteret]] as the first governor of New Jersey, who designated [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabethtown]] as the colony's capital.<ref>[[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] was not named after [[Queen Elizabeth I]], but rather after the wife of Sir [[George Carteret]], and was founded in 1664.</ref> However, the two proprietors found collecting the quitrents difficult, and on [[March 18]], [[1673]] Berkeley sold his share of New Jersey to the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]].<ref>Streissguth, Thomas (2002). New Jersey. San Diego: Lucent Books, Inc. ISBN 1-56006-872-8. pg 24-28</ref><ref>[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj13.htm Surrender from the Proprietors of East and West New Jersey, of Their Pretended Right of Government to Her Majesty] by The Avalon Project at [[Yale Law School]], retrieved [[December 15]], [[2005]]. </ref> 

This sale divided the province into [[East Jersey]] and [[West Jersey]]. The [[Border between West Jersey and East Jersey|exact border between West and East Jersey]] generally corresponded to the [[Keith line|border]] between present day [[South Jersey|South]] and [[North Jersey]] and was created by [[George Keith]]. However, the line was constantly the subject of disputes. With the 1676 [[Quintipartite Deed]] more accurate surveys and maps were made resulting in the Thornton line, drawn around 1696, and the Lawrence line, drawn around 1743, which was adopted as the final line for legal purposes.

Many of the colonists of New Jersey became farmers. However, despite the fertility of the soil, farmers were forced to struggle due to the dearth of [[British coinage|English money]]. Some owned [[slavery|slaves]] or had [[indentured servant]]s work for them. The majority of the colonists lived in simple log cabins, coming from the original Dutch settlers. Since New Jersey was ideally located next to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], colonists farmed, fished, and traded by sea. Transportation was slow and difficult usually on either foot or horseback. Education came through small religious schools, private academies, or tutors. 

On [[April 15]], [[1702]], under the reign of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], West and East Jersey were reunited as a [[royal colony]]. [[Edward Hyde]], Lord Cornbury became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. Lord Cornbury was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land, so in 1708 he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of [[New York]], but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused those governors of favoritism to New York. [[Lewis Morris (1671-1746)|Judge Lewis Morris]] led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] in 1738.<ref>Streissguth pg 30–36</ref> From 1701 to 1765, New Jersey's border with New York was in dispute, resulting in a [[New York-New Jersey Line War|series of skirmishes and raids]].

In 1746 ''The College of New Jersey'' (now [[Princeton University]]) was founded in Elizabethtown by a group of [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] "New Lighters" that included [[Jonathan Dickinson (of New Jersey)|Jonathan Dickinson]], [[Aaron Burr, Sr.]] and [[Peter Van Brugh Livingston]]. In 1756 the school moved to Princeton.

==American Revolution==
{{main|New Jersey during the American Revolution}}
New Jersey was one of the original thirteen colonies that joined in the [[American Revolution|struggle for independence]] from Great Britain. Many of the New Jersey settlers still felt ties of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalty to the British crown]], and many [[Slavery|slaves]] sided with the British in exchange for freedom.<ref>Streissguth pg 52–57</ref> The loyalists included the governor of New Jersey, [[William Franklin]].

{{wikisource|New Jersey Constitution of 1776}}
On [[July 2]], [[1776]], the first [[New Jersey State Constitution|Constitution of New Jersey]] was drafted, creating a basic framework for the state government. The [[New Jersey Constitution of 1776]] allowed "all inhabitants of this Colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money" to vote, including nonwhites and widows; married women could not own property under the [[common law]]. The Constitution declared itself temporary and to be void if there was reconciliation with [[Great Britain]].<ref> Klinghoffer and Elkis. "The Petticoat Electors: Women’s Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776&ndash;1807." Journal of the Early Republic, 12, no. 2 (1992): 159&ndash;193.</ref> Both political parties in elections mocked the other for relying on "petticoat electors" for allowing women to vote. Only two days after the new constitution was enacted, on [[July 4]], [[1776]], the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] was endorsed by five representatives from New Jersey.

New Jersey is referred to as the "Crossroads of the Revolution" because the British and Continental armies fought several crucial battles there.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060303205428/www.heritagetrail.org/crossroads.html Crossroads of the American Revolution] by Heritage Trail Association, retrieved [[December 16]], [[2005]].</ref> Throughout the war 296 engagements occurred in New Jersey, more than in any other colony. Four major battles were fought at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]], [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]], and [[Battle of Springfield (1780)|Springfield]]. The Battles of Trenton and Princeton are collectively referred to as the Ten Crucial Days because these desperately needed victories bolstered the morale of the nation. 
[[Image:Washington Crossing the Delaware.png|thumb|250px|''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'']]
On [[Christmas]] night of 1776, the [[Continental Army]], commanded by General [[George Washington]], made the famous crossing of the [[Delaware River]]. The scene was immortalized in [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]]'s painting ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'',<ref>Leutze took some artistic license in his famous painting. Mostly likely, everybody (not just Washington) would have been standing up in the boat, which would have had higher sides. In addition, the flag displayed in the painting was designed in 1777, after George Washington's 1776 Delaware River crossing. For more details, see [[Washington Crossing the Delaware]].</ref> and displayed on the [[State Quarters|New Jersey State Quarter]]. In the [[Battle of Trenton]] which followed the crossing, the American soldiers surprised the [[Hessian]]s, capturing nearly 900 prisoners in 90 minutes and taking supplies that had been for the British army. After the victory, George Washington led the army back across the Delaware River into [[Pennsylvania]]. 

A few days later, British General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] hoped to engage Washington's army at [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] after Washington recrossed the Delaware River, resulting in the [[Second Battle of Trenton]]. After recapturing Trenton, he ordered charges on fortified defenses at [[Assunpink Creek]]. The Americans inflicted heavy casualties on the British from their defenses. Later, the Continental army slipped past Cornwallis’s stalled army and launched an attack on British soldiers stationed at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] in the [[Battle of Princeton]] on [[January 3]], [[1777]]. The British at Princeton were forced to surrender. Cornwallis immediately ordered his army to engage the Americans at Princeton, but was prevented by snipers. These victories forced the British to leave New Jersey.

[[Image:MollyPitcher.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|[[Molly Pitcher]] taking over her husband's position at a [[cannon]]]]
On [[June 28]], [[1778]], the Continental Army under [[George Washington]] met a British column under Sir [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] at the [[Battle of Monmouth]]. Washington hoped to surprise and overwhelm the rear of the British army. General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] led the American attack on the British rear but retreated prematurely when the British attempted to flank the Americans. The retreat nearly led to disorder, but Washington managed to rally the troops to withstand two British counterattacks, both of which failed. As temperatures increased to over 100<sup>o</sup> [[Fahrenheit]], many soldiers fell to [[sunstroke]]. After the battle, Charles Lee was court-martialed for his poor command. Over 1,000 British casualties were incurred while the Americans lost 452 men. It was during this battle that the legendary "[[Molly Pitcher]]" is said to have fought.<ref>"Molly Pitcher" has sometimes been regarded as a real person, although historians now often believe the story is a myth, although probably loosely based on the actions of real women. See [[Molly Pitcher]].</ref>

The last major battle to take place in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War (and for the rest of the history of New Jersey) was the [[Battle of Springfield (1780)|Battle of Springfield]]. [[Baron von Knyphausen]], the Hessian general, hoped to invade New Jersey and expected support from colonists of New Jersey who were tired of the war. He hoped to secure [[Hobart Gap]], from which he could attack the American headquarters in [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]]. On [[June 23]], [[1780]], the British attacked soldiers under the command of [[Nathanael Greene]]. General Greene successfully stopped a two-pronged attack from entrenchments held across the [[Raritan River]], preventing the British invasion.

New Jersey ratified and then signed the [[Articles of Confederation]] on [[November 26]], [[1779]]. In the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall of [[Princeton University]]. It had originally convened in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], but mutinous troops prevented the meeting from taking place. Princeton became the temporary capital for the nation for four months. During the brief stay in Princeton, the Continental Congress was informed of the end of the war by the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] on [[September 3]], [[1783]]. On [[December 18]], [[1787]], New Jersey became the third state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and on [[November 20]], [[1789]], New Jersey became the first state in the Nation to ratify the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

New Jersey played a major role in creating the structure of the new [[United States Government]]. When Virginia delegates proposed [[Virginia Plan|a plan]] calling for representation based on the population of each state, the smaller states refused, fearing that with such a plan they would no longer have a say in government affairs. [[William Paterson]], a New Jersey statesman, introduced the [[New Jersey Plan]], by which one vote would be given to each state, providing equal representation within the legislative body. The [[Great Compromise]] accepted both plans, creating two separate bodies in the [[United States Congress|Congress]].

==Nineteenth century==
{{main|New Jersey in the 19th century}}
===Industrial Revolution===
The economy of New Jersey was largely based on agriculture, but crop failures and poor soil plagued the settlers of New Jersey. However, New Jersey eventually funded publications in the early 1850s of accurate agriculture-related surveys through the effort of [[George H. Cook]]. The publication of this survey helped to increase the state’s involvement in agricultural research and direct support to farmers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060827065022/www.scc.rutgers.edu/njh/SciANDTech/Agriculture/overview_text.htm|title=Historical Overview- Where's the Garden?|accessmonthday=September 18|accessyear=2007}}</ref> As agriculture became a less reliable source of income for New Jerseyans, many began turning towards more industrialized methods. 

[[Image:DSCN2881 passaic falls.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The Great Falls of the Passaic River]]
[[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] became the cradle of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in America. Energy was harnessed from the 77&nbsp;feet (23&nbsp;m) high [[Great Falls of the Passaic River]]. The city became an important site for mills and other industries. These include the [[textile]], [[firearm]]s, [[silk]], and [[locomotive|railroad locomotive]] manufacturing industries. Because of its high silk production, it became nicknamed the "Silk City". In 1835, [[Samuel Colt]] began producing firearms in the city.

{{wikisource|New Jersey Constitution of 1844}}
The second version of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]] was written in 1844. The constitution provided suffrage only to white males, removing it from all women and from people of other races. Suffrage had been awarded to those groups under the original New Jersey State Constitution of 1776. Some important components of the second State Constitution include the separation of the powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The new constitution also provided a [[bill of rights]]. Underneath the constitution, the people had the right to elect the [[governor]].

The famous inventor [[Thomas Edison]] was born in 1847. Edison worked in [[Edison, New Jersey|Menlo Park]], and was known as "the Wizard of Menlo Park" for his many inventions; over the course of his life, he was granted 1,093 patents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/inventor/edison.html|title=The Wizard of Menlo Park|accessmonthday=December 16|accessyear=2005}}</ref> His most famous inventions included the [[phonograph]], the [[kinetoscope]], the [[stock ticker]], the [[Dictaphone]] and the [[tattoo gun]]. He also is credited with improving the designs of the [[incandescent light bulb]], [[radio]], the [[telegraph]], and the [[telephone]]. He started the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]]. One of his famous sayings was, "Genius is one percent inspiration and 99% perspiration", as his efforts consisted of research and testing.

The agricultural products from New Jersey usually were transported to larger markets in New York City and Philadelphia, requiring better transportation. The first oceangoing [[steamboat]] went from [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], sailed around southern New Jersey, and ended in Philadelphia. Later, systems of canals were built, the first of which is called the [[Morris Canal]] and ran from [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey]], on the [[Delaware River]] to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], on the [[Hudson River]]. The [[Delaware and Raritan canal]] ran from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], on the [[Raritan River]], to [[Bordentown, New Jersey]], on the Delaware River. [[Locomotion]] was also improved; Hoboken-born inventor [[John Stevens (inventor)|John Stevens]] built a 10&nbsp;ton locomotive and his son [[Robert L. Stevens]] started constructing iron railroads. By 1833, [[The Camden & Amboy Railroad]] had been completed, allowing a 7&nbsp;hour passage between Philadelphia and New York City. Through the 1800s, over a dozen companies were operating railroad lines.

===War and slavery===
During the [[Mexican-American War]], a battalion of volunteers from New Jersey, in four companies, was active from September 1847 to July 1848. [[Philip Kearny]], an officer who led a [[cavalry]] unit, followed General [[Winfield Scott]] and fought in the [[Battle of Contreras]] and [[Battle of Churubusco]]. After the war, Kearny made his home in the state of New Jersey.

[[Image:GeorgeMcClellan.jpeg|thumb|left|240px|[[George B. McClellan]]]]
The [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] population was especially intolerant of slavery, and the state was a major part of the [[Underground Railroad]]. Though New Jersey passed an act for the gradual abolition of slavery in 1804, it was not until 1830 that most blacks were free in the state. New Jersey was the last northern state to abolish slavery completely, and by the close of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], about a dozen African-Americans in New Jersey were still apprenticed freedmen. New Jersey at first refused to ratify the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Constitutional Amendment banning slavery]].

Although no Civil War battles were fought within New Jersey, the state sent over 88,000 soldiers as part of some 31 infantry and cavalry regiments, and over 6,000 died in the war. 23,116 of those soldiers served in the [[Army of the Potomac]]. Soldiers from New Jersey fought generally in the War's Eastern theater.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060830212413/www.scc.rutgers.edu/njh/CivWar/Battles/new_jersey_in_the_civil_war.htm |title=New Jersey in the Civil War|accessmonthday=September 18|accessyear=2007}}</ref> [[Philip Kearny]], an officer from the [[Mexican-American War]], led a brigade of New Jersey regiments under Brigadier General [[William B. Franklin]]. Kearny distinguished himself as a brilliant officer during the [[Peninsula Campaign]], and was promoted to the position of [[major general]].

New Jersey was one of the few states to favor [[Stephen Douglas]] over [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the Presidential [[Election of 1860]]. The people of New Jersey also cast its [[electoral votes]] to [[George B. McClellan]] when he ran for President against [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the election of 1864, being the only free state that rejected Lincoln twice. McClellan was later elected governor, serving from 1878 to 1881.

Many industrial cities like [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] grew extremely strong through the duration of the Civil War. They produced many necessities, including clothing and war materials like [[ammunition]]. These cities prospered through heavy production even after the end of the war.<ref>Stewart, Mark (2004).

==Twentieth century==
{{main|New Jersey in the 20th century}}

===Early 1900s and World War I===
The [[Standard Oil Company]] of New Jersey was a large integrated oil producing, transporting, refining, and marketing organization, founded by [[Henry H. Rogers]], [[William Rockefeller]], and [[John D. Rockefeller]]. In 1911, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ordered the dissolution of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, viewing it as violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. Standard Oil had controlled nearly 90% of refined oil flows into the United States, having a near complete monopoly upon it. Standard Oil Company was split into 34 smaller companies as a result of the dissolution.

New Jersey was a center of shipbuilding and manufacturing during [[World War I]]. Existing factories such as the [[Singer Company]] in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] were converted to making weapon parts. New [[refineries]] and [[ammunition]] factories were built by companies like [[DuPont|DuPont Engineering]]. After the war, many of these companies and plants shifted to chemicals, making New Jersey one of the world's leading chemical producers. Several [[Participants in World War I|Allied]] ships were sunk off the New Jersey coast.

[[Camp Merritt, New Jersey|Camp Merritt]], in [[Cresskill, New Jersey|Cresskill]], was activated for use in [[World War I]]. It was from there that many soldiers were deployed to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] before shipping off to Europe. Camp Merritt was decommissioned in November 1919.<ref>[http://www.bergencountyhistory.org/Pages/campmerritt.html Camp Merritt] by Kevin Wright, retrieved [[December 19]], [[2005]].</ref> [[Fort Dix]], in [[Pemberton Township, New Jersey]], was also constructed in 1917 to help in the war effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/fort-dix.htm|title=Fort Dix|accessmonthday=December 19|accessyear=2005}}</ref> It was used as a training and staging ground throughout the war. After the war, it was converted into a demobilization center.

===Roaring Twenties===
Like much of the rest of the United States, New Jersey entered a [[Roaring Twenties|prosperous state]] through the 1920s. Through this period, New Jersey's population and employment rate increased greatly. Though [[factory]] production decreased after the end of World War I, production lines still remained in relatively high production. 

Transportation became much easier through the 1920s. [[Car]]s became easily affordable and roads were paved and improved such that they incorporated new road features, including [[jughandle]] turns. As a result, people who had never been farther than the outskirts of their hometown now could travel around the state. The [[Jersey Shore]] became extremely popular as an attraction. Many bridges and tunnels were built for the ease of interstate traveling. The [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] was completed linking [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in 1926. The [[Holland Tunnel]], under the [[Hudson River]], was completed in 1927, providing a means of easy transportation between New Jersey and [[New York City]]. Before, [[ferry|ferries]] were required to travel across the Hudson River. Later on, the [[George Washington Bridge]] (1931) and the [[Lincoln Tunnel]] (1937) were completed, making access to [[Manhattan]] even easier.<ref>Stewart pg 30–32</ref> All of the tunnels and bridges linking New York and New Jersey are managed by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], established on [[April 30]], [[1921]].

New Jersey was also the first state in the United States to ratify [[Prohibition]], which restricted the purchasing and selling of [[alcohol]]. However, the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which banned alcohol consumption, was later repealed by the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] in December 1933. [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark's]] [[Brewery|breweries]] reopened almost immediately.

===Great Depression era===
Like the rest of the United States, the people of New Jersey were hit hard by the [[Great Depression]]. By 1933, one-tenth of the population was dependent upon [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]. In fact, New Jersey issued begging licenses to the poor people because the New Jersey government funds were being exhausted.<ref>Gerdes, Louise I. <u>The 1930s</u>, Greenhaven Press, Inc., 2000.</ref> Under the [[Works Progress Administration]], part of the Second New Deal by FDR, many new jobs were provided in order to support the poor, including the expansion of [[Fort Dix, New Jersey|Fort Dix]], [[Roosevelt Park]] in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison]], and [[Rutgers Stadium]] in [[Piscataway, New Jersey|Piscataway]]. [[Strike action|Strikes]] also grew common during the Great Depression; in 1937 a group of gravediggers from New Jersey went on strike.

In 1938, [[Orson Welles]] produced ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' radio broadcast. Listeners were told that a "huge, flaming object... fell on a farm in the neighborhood of Grover’s Mill... twenty-two miles from Trenton."<ref>Gerdes pg 210–218</ref> It described [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] monsters that were causing much destruction. Although it was announced in advance that it was a radio play, the broadcast resulted in widespread panic into New Jersey and the surrounding areas. Many people had believed the bulletin to be real, causing them to flee the New Jersey area or to blockade their homes to ensure safety from the reported monsters. [[CBS]] was criticized for allowing fictitious bulletins to gain attention of listeners. Welles and the other broadcasters were not punished by law, but were held under a brief informal "[[house arrest]]" for a short period.

During the Great Depression, 20-month old [[Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr.]], son of famous aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]], was abducted from his home near [[Hopewell, New Jersey]] in the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]. The police sealed off many roads to prevent the kidnapper's escape, and interrogated the members of the Lindbergh household. Federal expert [[Arthur Koehler]] carefully examined the ladder used by the kidnapper, which he traced to a company in [[McCormick, South Carolina]]. [[James J. Finn]] was a lieutenant who attempted to capture the kidnapper while he was passing off ransom bills. Finally, a ransom note was located and traced to [[Bruno Hauptmann]]; the bill had the license plate number of Hauptmann's [[Dodge]] Saloon that was written down by a gas attendant. He was tried in [[Flemington, New Jersey]] in what was known as the "Trial of the Century", and was convicted. He was [[electric chair|electrocuted]] in the [[New Jersey State Prison]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref>Gerdes pg 230–240</ref> The Lindbergh kidnapping led to passage of the [[Federal Kidnapping Act]], also known as the "Lindbergh Law", which made kidnapping a federal crime. 
[[Image:Hindenburg burning.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]] just moments after catching fire.]]

In 1937, the German [[zeppelin]] [[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]] exploded over [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]]. While approaching a mooring mast in Lakehurst, the zeppelin suddenly caught fire, and within 34 seconds the entire hydrogen-filled zeppelin was engulfed in flames; 36 people died in the disaster, most of them leaping from the burning ship. Contrary to popular belief, the Hindenburg had flown an entire year of successful voyages before it caught on fire. Questions and controversy surround the accident to this day: theories for the sudden burst of flames include sabotage against the German [[Nazis]], static buildup, and flammable fabric.

===World War II and the 1940s===
[[Image:Camden Shipyard 1919.jpg|thumb|left|320px|A fleet of naval forces being constructed in the Camden shipyards.]]
New Jersey shipyards were responsible for the construction of many naval ships in [[World War II]], including [[battleship]]s, [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[heavy cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s, receiving 9% of all allied war-related contracts through the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060716111533/www.scc.rutgers.edu/njh/WW2/WW2TIMELINE.htm |title=World War II Time Line: New Jersey and the World|accessmonthday=September 18|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Nearly 500,000 residents enlisted for the war,<ref>Stewart pg 30–37</ref> more than 10% of the total population of New Jersey at the time, causing many women to take jobs in their husbands’ absences. A German [[U-boat]] (U-689) was sunk off the coast of New Jersey in 1945.

[[Camp Kilmer]] was a staging area near [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] serving the port of [[New York]]. Buildings were painted such that they had a camouflage effect. Camp Kilmer helped to serve troops by offering medical care and providing them with supplies. Camp Kilmer was later reactivated for the [[Korean War]] and the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]]. Fort Dix was reopened for the training of soldiers for the war effort. During the war, [[Naval Weapons Station Earle]] in Monmouth County was opened for naval production, which provided ships with a safe port to take on ammunition.

[[Millville Airport]] opened on [[August 2]], [[1941]]. It was called "America's First Defense Airport" because it was opened as a gunnery training area for fighter pilots. Over 1,500 pilots were trained for advanced aircraft fighting at this airport.<ref>[http://www.p47millville.org/ Millville Army Airfield], by JasperDyne Industries, retrieved [[December 26]], [[2005]].</ref> [[Fort Hancock, New Jersey|Fort Hancock]] was also opened in [[Sandy Hook (New Jersey)|Sandy Hook]]. Gunners in the fort prevented German submarines from entering [[New York Harbor]]. The airfield, currently known as [[McGuire Air Force Base]], was opened in 1937 as [[Rudd Field]], a supporting Army airfield for Fort Dix. It was expanded during wartime operations and turned over to the Air Force in 1949.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/mcguire.htm McGuire Air Force Base], [[GlobalSecurity.org]], retrieved [[January 10]], [[2006]].</ref>

An [[Japanese American internment|internment camp]] housing people of Japanese, German, and Italian descent was located in [[Gloucester City, New Jersey|Gloucester City]]. In addition, [[Seabrook Farms, New Jersey|Seabrook Farms]] took advantage of Japanese labor to increase productivity when the government allowed small groups of people from the internment camps to work there. At the end of [[World War II]], the government closed down the internment camps, but many people from the camps continued to work at Seabrook Farms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.cumberland.nj.us/tourism/seabrook_museum/|title=Seabrook Museum|accessmonthday=December 26|accessyear=2005}}</ref> 

{{wikisource|New Jersey Constitution of 1947}}
In 1947, the current [[New Jersey State Constitution]] was ratified, reorganizing the state government. Governors were allowed to serve four years instead of three, and [[New Jersey Legislature|the Legislature]] was constituted with a 40-member [[New Jersey Senate|Senate]] and an 80-member [[New Jersey General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The new State Constitution also returned the right of suffrage to females and non-whites.

===Late twentieth century===
In the 1950s, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] planned and built the [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal]] in the cities of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]]. This was the first port in the world to [[containerization#history|containerize]] due to the innovation of [[Malcolm McLean]] and the founding of the [[Sea-Land Corporation]]. The newly opened port quickly made the docks of [[Brooklyn]], [[Lower Manhattan]] and [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] obsolete. In 1985, <!-- earlier too?? --> the port was the busiest in the world. (See [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal]]).

During the 1960s, many African Americans felt disenfranchised, feelings exacerbated by the police that usually sided against African Americans and by the poor urban conditions caused by urban decay. This tension led to race riots, the first of which occurred in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] on [[August 2]], [[1964]], causing heavy damage to the Jersey City area. 71 stores were damaged and 46 people were injured. From [[August 11]] to [[August 13]], [[1964]], similar riots occurred in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]]. In the Paterson riot, twenty stores and other buildings were damaged, and eight people were injured. In the Elizabeth riot, six people were injured and seventeen stores were damaged. In the aftermath of these riots, 135 people were arrested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041227042001/www.bergen.org/ourstory/projects/patersonriot/overview.html |title=Overview of Paterson Riots|accessmonthday=September 18|accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/cityinstress/mccone/part3.html|title=The Crisis- an Overview|accessmonthday=January 9|accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

In the summer of 1967, urban residents, primarily African Americans, rioted for 5 days in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and the neighboring city of [[1967 Plainfield riots|Plainfield]] in the [[1967 Newark riots]]. 24 people died in the riots, and nearly 1,600 were arrested. The riots are often cited as a major factor in the decline of Newark and its neighboring communities, as many residents fled to the [[suburbs]] following the riots.

[[Image:Johnson Kosygin Glassboro Meeting.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lyndon Johnson meets [[Aleksei Kosygin]] in [[Glassboro, New Jersey|Glassboro]]]]
In the middle of the [[Cold War]] from [[June 23]] to [[June 25]], [[1967]], president [[Lyndon Johnson]] met with Soviet premier [[Aleksei Kosygin]] in [[Glassboro, New Jersey]] for the Glassboro Summit Conference.<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/presidents/bio36.htm Biography of Lyndon Johnson] ([[February 4]], [[2004]]), retrieved [[December 25]], [[2005]].</ref> at the [[Rowan University|Glassboro State College]]. No specific agreements were reached, especially in the area of restrictions on [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems. However, the meeting helped improve the strained relationships between the Soviet Union and the US.

Because of its strategic location on the East Coast, New Jersey played an important role in the United States' [[Cold War]] defense. 14 [[Project Nike|Nike]] anti-aircraft missile batteries in two groups were constructed in New Jersey to protect the metropolitan areas around [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]]. In addition, a regional command center was built in New Jersey. By 1974, the missile sites were deactivated. In addition to these, air defense [[radar]] sites, bases for interceptor aircraft, anti-aircraft gun batteries, surface-to-air missile sites, and command and control facilities were constructed to defend against an attack by long range, nuclear-armed aircraft of the [[Soviet Air Force]].<ref>Donald E. Bender (1999). Nike Missile Sites in New Jersey. Retrieved [[December 17]], [[2005]]. <br />[http://alpha.fdu.edu/~bender/NYmsg.html http://alpha.fdu.edu/~bender/NYmsg.html]</ref>

In 1998, the south side of [[Ellis Island]] came under the jurisdiction of New Jersey following a [[US Supreme Court]] decision. Before, the island had been governed by the state of [[New York]]. However, after the court decision, disagreements between New Jersey and New York led to the sharing of jurisdiction over the island by the two states.

===Terrorist attacks===
In the morning of [[September 11]], [[2001]], hijackers took control of four domestic U.S. commercial airliners, including [[United Airlines Flight 93]] which departed from [[Newark International Airport]] in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. All of the planes crashed, two of them into the two tallest towers of the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City which collapsed within two hours and were viewable from New Jersey. 2,986 deaths occurred in the attacks, including about 700 residents of New Jersey.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/nj911memorial/ 9/11 Memorial], message from [[James E. McGreevey]]. Retrieved [[January 7]], [[2006]].</ref> Over 160,000 people were evacuated by ferry from the Manhattan area to New Jersey because the [[New York City subway|subway]] and [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] station had been closed down.<ref>[http://www.worldshipny.com/nyferries.htm New York ferries], by Theodore W. Scull, retrieved [[January 7]], [[2006]].</ref>

The destruction of Lower Manhattan office space accelerated the pre-2001 trend of moving jobs from Lower Manhattan to Midtown and New Jersey. The [[Goldman Sachs Tower]] was constructed in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] as part of this effect. Towns in New Jersey such as [[Middletown Township, New Jersey|Middletown]] that were especially hard hit suffered from aftereffects of the attack.<ref>[http://www.apa.org/monitor/nov02/newlife.html A new life passage after 9/11] ([[November 10]], [[2002]]), by J.

[[Image:Daschle_letter.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A letter sent to [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Tom Daschle]] containing [[anthrax]] powder caused the deaths of two postal workers.]]
For several weeks beginning on [[September 18]], [[2001]], letters bearing a [[Trenton, New Jersey]] postmark and containing [[anthrax]] bacteria were mailed to several news media offices and two US Senators. [[2001 anthrax attacks|These anthrax attacks]] resulted in the deaths of five people and caused twenty-two people to develop anthrax infections (eleven of which were life-threatening).

===2004–05 gubernatorial vacancy===
[[Image:SenatorJonCorzine.jpg|thumb|left|Current Governor [[Jon Corzine]]]]
{{main|Politics of New Jersey}}
Former Governor [[Jim McGreevey|James E. McGreevey]] resigned on [[November 15]], [[2004]] after charges of [[Pay to Play|pay-to-play]] and extortion scandals involving the impropriety of the appointment of an unqualified long rumored homosexual love interest. New Jersey had no Lieutenant Governor position at the time, leaving a vacancy in the office. Senate President [[Richard Codey]] served as Acting Governor (then Governor) in McGreevey's place. [[Jon Corzine]] was elected [[Governor]] of New Jersey on [[November 8]], [[2005]], and took office on [[January 17]], [[2006]]. On [[Election Day]], [[November 8]], [[2005]], the voters passed an amendment to the state constitution creating the position of [[Lieutenant Governor]], effective with the 2009 elections.
