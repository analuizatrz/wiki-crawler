'''Providence''' is the [[capital]] and the most populous city of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]].  The population within the city limits is estimated to be 176,862 as of 2005, and is the anchor of the [[List of United States metropolitan areas|35th largest metropolitan population]] in the country, with an estimated [[metropolitan statistical areas|MSA]] population of 1,622,520, exceeding that of Rhode Island by about 60%. 

The city is located in [[Providence County, Rhode Island|Providence County]] and is the second-largest city in [[New England]]. Providence was once nicknamed the "Beehive of Industry" and, since the [[1990s]], "The Renaissance City," though as of 2000 census, its poverty rate was still among the ten highest for cities over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-19.pdf | title=U.S. Census 2000| author=Bishaw, Alemayehu, and John Iceland|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>

Providence was named by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] in honor of "God's merciful Providence" in his finding this spot to settle when expelled by the [[Puritan]]s from [[Massachusetts]]. The official name of the state includes the name of the city, ''Rhode Island and Providence Plantations''. The city was one of the first cities to industrialize in the United States and was noted for its [[jewelry]] and [[silverware]] industry. Today, Providence is the economic, cultural, and political hub of Rhode Island.

==History==
{{main|History of Providence}}
This area was first settled in 1636 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], and was one of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Williams secured a title from the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] natives around this time and gave the city its present name.  Williams cultivated Providence as a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters, as he himself had been exiled from [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="3.5-centuries">{{cite web | url=http://www.providenceri.com/history/centuries1.html | title=Three and One-Half Centuries at a Glance | date=May 2002| accessdate =2006-01-17}}</ref>

[[Image:Providence old.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Providence in the mid-20th century]]
Providence's growth was slow during the next quarter-century. The Providence territory would become smaller as more and more of the land would become part of different towns. The city's slow growth was also due to the rocky, hilly, and heavily wooded land which made farming difficult, as well as the tradition of dissent and independent-mindedness. 

In the mid-[[1770s]], the British government's passage of several laws levying various taxes impeding Providence's primary economy of maritime and fishing industries caused Providence to join the other colonies in renouncing allegiance to the British Crown.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/> One such law was the [[Sugar Act]], which impacted Providence's distilleries and its trade in rum and slaves.  In response to enforcement of unpopular trade laws, Providence residents spilled (arguably) the first blood of the American Revolution in [[1772]] in the notorious [[Gaspee Affair]].  During the [[Revolutionary War]], the city suffered major interruptions in education and trade as a result of its location and facility as quarters for many troops passing through the area.

[[Image:Woonasquatucket_River.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A historic mill on the [[Woonasquatucket River]]]]Following the war, Providence's main focus on its economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, particularly in machine tools, silverware, jewelry and textiles.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/> At one time, Providence boasted some of the [[History of Providence|largest manufacturing plants in the country]] including Brown & Sharpe, Nicholson File, and Gorham Silverware.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/>  The city's industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Portugal, Cape Verde, and French Canada. Nevertheless, the city experienced social strife, notably with a series of race riots between whites and blacks during the [[1820s]]. In response to this and its growth, Providence residents ratified a city charter in 1831. The city became the sole capital of Rhode Island in 1900.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/>

The city began to see a decline by the mid-[[1920s]] as industries, notably in textiles, shut down.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/> The [[Great Depression]] hit the city hard, and Providence's downtown was flooded by the [[New England Hurricane of 1938]] soon after. The city saw further decline as a result of the nation-wide trends, with the construction of highways and increased suburbanization.

Providence was notorious from the [[1950s]] into the [[1980s]] as a bastion of [[organized crime]]. The legendary mafia boss Raymond Patriarca ruled a vast criminal enterprise from the city for over three decades, during which murders and disappearances associated with organized crime would become commonplace.<ref>{{cite web | author=May, Allan | url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/providence_mob/1.html | title=All About the Providence Mob|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

[[Image:Providenceconstruction.JPG|thumb|left|200px|New construction in Providence (August 2006): cranes seen for [[Waterplace|Waterplace Condominium]] towers, Westin addition, and the [[GTECH]] headquarters prior to completion]]
The city began to revive beginning in the [[1970s]]. From 1975 until 1982, [[United States dollar|$]]606 million of Community Development money, including funds from local and national sources, were invested throughout the city, and the population began to stabilize.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/> In the [[1990s]], Mayor [[Vincent Cianci, Jr]] continued revitalization efforts by showcasing the city as a center for the arts and pushing further efforts. These included opening up the city's natural rivers (which had been nearly paved over), moving a large section of railroad underground, building [[Waterplace Park]] and riverwalks along the river's banks, and constructing the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Bank of America Skating Rink) in downtown and the 1.4 million ft<sup>2</sup> [[Providence Place]] Mall.

The recent Providence Renaissance has triggered new investment within the city, including many new condo projects, hotels, and a new office tower, which are quickly filling in more of the land freed up by the railroad relocation.  For more detail, see [[Current and Recent Construction Projects in Providence]].

Although the new projects will expand the Providence tax base and build its skyline, there is fear that they will ruin the historic look of the city.  Additional concerns include an equitable taxation policy for several of the new luxury highrises.  Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem as it does in most [[New England]] [[post-industrial]] cities, with nearly 30 percent of its population living below the poverty line.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:WaterPlace Providence.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Waterplace Park]]]]
Providence is located at 41°49'25" North, 71°25'20" West (41.823550, -71.422132).{{GR|1}} According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 53.2 [[square kilometre|km²]] (20.5 [[square mile|mi²]]). 47.8 km² (18.5 mi²) of it is land and 5.3 km² (2.1 mi²) of it is water.  The total area is 10.03% water.

Providence is located at the head of [[Narragansett Bay]], with the [[Providence River]] running into the bay through the center of the city. The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river's banks through downtown. Constitution Hill (near downtown), College (or Prospect) Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and is New England's largest Italian district) are the most prominent of the city's seven hills. The remaining hills include Tockwotten Hill at [[Fox Point, Providence, Rhode Island|Fox Point]], Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston & Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill at the lower end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early [[1880s]].

===Cityscape===
[[Image:Westminsterstreet.JPG|thumb|200px|Perspective of Westminster Street|left]]
The city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of [[eastern seaboard]] cities which developed prior to use of the automobile.  For this reason, Providence has the [[List of U.S. cities with most pedestrian commuters|eighth-highest percentage]] of pedestrian commuters.  It has no discernable street grid, having been initially laid out for horse-drawn carriage.  As a consequence, parts of downtown and the [[East Side, Providence|East Side]] have streets too narrow to be used for two-way traffic.  

Many 19th century mercantile buildings in the [[Federal style architecture|Federal]] and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings, are located throughout the Downcity area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development.  Fountain Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.  

The newer area includes [[Providence Place Mall]] ([[1999]]), a [[The Westin Providence|Westin hotel]] ([[1993]]), [[GTECH]] ([[2006]]), new condominium construction, and [[Waterplace Park]] ([[1994]]); the area tends toward newer development since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks which was referred to colloquially as the "Chinese Wall".<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=William McKenzie |title=PPS/AIAri Guide to Providence Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Providence Preservation Society |location=Providence, RI |isbn=0-9742847-0-X |pages=13 }}</ref> This part of Downcity is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and intent landscaping.[[Image:Picture 270.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Providence Skyscrapers from Congdon Street(Prospect Terrace Park)]]

The historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did eighty years ago. Most of the state's tallest buildings are found here.  The largest structure, to date, is the art-deco-styled former Industrial Trust Tower, currently the [[Bank of America Tower (Providence)|Bank of America Building]] at 426 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (130 [[metre|m]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125380 |title=Bank of America Building, Providence|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest [[Sovereign Bank Tower (Providence)|One Financial Center]], designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half century later.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125377 | title=One Financial Plaza| accessdate=2006-06-05}}</ref> In between the two and completing the skyline seen in [[Family Guy]] is [[50 Kennedy Plaza]]. The [[Textron Tower]] is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline. Downcity is also the home of the [[Providence Biltmore]] and [[Westminster Arcade]], the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=101896 | title=Providence Buildings, Real Estate, Architecture, Skyscrapers, and Construction Database | accessdate=2005-11-07}}</ref> 

[[Image:Westminsterarcade.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Westminster Arcade]], the oldest mall in the United States, built 1828.]]The city's southern waterfront, away from the downcity core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a decommissioned Russian submarine, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants.

The majority of the cityscape is comprised of abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, triple and double-decker housing (though the [[townhome|row houses]] found in so commonly in other Northeast cities, are notably absent here),<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=William McKenzie |title=PPS/AIAri Guide to Providence Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Providence Preservation Society |location=Providence, RI |isbn=0-9742847-0-X |pages=227 }}</ref> a small number of high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the [[West End, Providence, Rhode Island|West End]].

The [[Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies]] has emerged from the cityscape to investigate the urban environment of Providence in detail. Since its inauguration in 2001, this group of socially engaged artists has conducted a number of experimental activities.

===Climate===
[[Image:Waterplacepark.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Waterplace Park]]
Providence's climate is humid continental, with hot summers, cold winters, and high humidity year-round. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] rates the city at Zone 6a, which is an "in-between" climate. The influence of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] keeps Providence, and the rest of the state of Rhode Island, warmer than many inland locales in New England.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/hzm-ne1.html | title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.growit.com/bin/USDAZoneMaps.exe?MyState=RI | title=Rhode Island ISDA Hardiness Zone Map|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> January is the coldest month with average high temperatures of 37°&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|F]] (3°&nbsp;[[Celsius|C]]) and average low temperatures of 19°&nbsp;F (-7°&nbsp;C).<ref name="weather.com-monthly-climate">{{cite web | url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/fitness/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/02906?from=36hr_bottomnav_fitness | title=Monthly average temperatures and precipitation|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> July is the warmest month with average high temperatures of 82°&nbsp;F (28°&nbsp;C) and average low temperatures of 64°&nbsp;F (18°&nbsp;C).<ref name="weather.com-monthly-climate"/> The record high temperature in the city was 104°&nbsp;F (40°&nbsp;C) recorded in 1975. The record low temperature in the city was -13°&nbsp;F (-25°&nbsp;C) recorded in 1976. 

As with the rest of the northeastern seaboard, Providence receives ample precipitation year-round. Monthly precipitation ranges from a high of 4.43 [[inches]] (112.5 [[1 E-3 m|mm]]) in March to a low of 3.17 inches (80.5 mm) in July.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://weather.yahoo.com/climo/USRI0050_f.html | title=Providence Weather: Records and Averages | accessdate=2005-09-13}}</ref> Precipitation levels are generally slightly lesser in the summer months than the winter months when powerful storms known as [[Nor'easter]]s can cause significant snowfall and [[blizzard]] conditions. Though not frequent, Providence's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to Atlantic [[hurricane]]s.

==Economy==
[[Image: Providencetextronside.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Textron Tower|Textron's headquarters]], in the company of [[Sovereign Bank Tower (Providence)|One Financial Plaza]] and the Rhode Island Hospital Trust building]]Providence was one of the first cities to industrialize in the United States. By 1830, the city had manufacturing industries in metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Though manufacturing has declined, the city is still one of the largest centers for [[jewellery|jewelry]] and [[silverware]] design and manufacturing. Services, particularly education, health care, and finance, also make up a large portion of the city's economy. Since it is the capital of Rhode Island, Providence's economy also consists of government services. The three largest employers today are Hasbro Managerial Services, [[Rhode Island Hospital]], and the Providence School Department.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2006/snapshots/PL4459000.html | title=Best Places to Live: Providence, RI | publisher=CNN Money Magazine|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>  Providence is also home to [[List of hospitals in Rhode Island|nine hospitals]].

The Fortune 500 conglomerate [[Textron]] and Fortune 1000 company Nortek Incorporated are both headquartered in the city, and [[GTECH]]'s world headquarters has recently been moved to downtown Providence.  Another company whose origins were in the city is [[FleetBoston Financial|Fleet Bank]].

Before its acquisition by [[Bank of America]], Fleet merged with [[BankBoston]] to become New England's largest commercial bank.

The city is home to the [[Rhode Island Convention Center]], which opened in December 1993. Along with a hotel, the convention center is connected to the [[Providence Place|Providence Place Mall]], a major retail center, through a [[skywalk]].
