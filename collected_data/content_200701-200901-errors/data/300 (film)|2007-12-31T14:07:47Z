'''''300''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] film adaptation of the [[graphic novel]] ''[[300 (comics)|300]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], and is a fictionalized retelling of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]. The film is directed by [[Zack Snyder]] with Frank Miller attached as an [[executive producer]] and consultant, and was shot mostly with [[bluescreen]] to duplicate the imagery of the original comic book.

[[Sparta]]n [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] ([[Gerard Butler]]) and 300 Spartans fight to the last man against [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Xerxes I of Persia|King Xerxes]] ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]) and his army of over one million soldiers, while in Sparta, [[Gorgo (Sparta)|Queen Gorgo]] ([[Lena Headey]]) attempts to rally support for her husband. The story is framed by a [[voice-over]] narrative by the Spartan soldier [[Aristodemus (Spartan)|Dilios]] ([[David Wenham]]). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing ''300'' within the genre of [[historical fantasy]].

''300'' was released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters in the United States on [[March 9]], [[2007]], and on [[DVD]], [[Blu-Ray]] and [[HD DVD]] on [[July 31]], [[2007]]. The film broke [[box office]] records, although critics were divided over its look and style. Some acclaimed it as an original achievement, while others criticized it for favoring visuals over [[characterization]] and its controversial depiction of the ancient Persians.

==Plot==
<!-- ATTENTION! PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING! Please help keep this section brief. Every detail about the plot of 300 or every funny quote does not belong here. --> <!-- Also, the quote "THIS IS SPARTA!!" or "PREPARE FOR BATTLE!" isn't necessary, you can hear it in many other places & everyone knows it by now -->

A Spartan named Dilios narrates of the young [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] undergoing his [[Agoge|childhood training]], explaining the rigors of Spartan life. Leonidas is cast out into the wild, and survives the harsh winter to return to his home, when he is crowned King. Dilios then tells the story of the Persian messengers arriving at [[Sparta]] and demanding Sparta's submission to King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Outraged and offended at their behavior, King [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] kicks the messenger into a pit; the other messengers suffer the same fate. Resolving to face the Persians, Leonidas visits [[Pythia|the Oracle]], proposing a strategy to repel the numerically superior enemy, and offers the priests a customary payment in gold. The priests, called [[Ephors]], having already been bribed by Xerxes, interpret the Oracle's message to mean that Sparta should not go to war, so as to not interrupt the sacred [[Carneian festival]].

[[Image:300- Leonidas fighting Persian soldiers.jpg|thumb|225px|left|King Leonidas fighting soldiers of the Persian Empire]]

Despite the warning, Leonidas gathers 300 of his best soldiers to fight the Persians, selecting only those who have already sired male children, so that their [[family name]] can continue even after their death. As they march north, they are joined by a group of [[Arcadia]]ns and other [[Greeks]]. Arriving at the narrow cliffs of [[Thermopylae]] (referred to as the "Hot Gates"), in sight of the Persian army, they build a wall to contain the Persians' advance immediately in front of their position. [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]], a hunchbacked Spartan whose parents had fled to save him from [[Sparta#Society|customary infanticide]], approaches Leonidas, requesting to redeem his father's name in battle, and warning him about a secret goat path that the Persians could use to outflank them, and surround them. Leonidas turns him away because he is unable to properly hold the shield, and would therefore create a weak spot in the [[phalanx formation|phalanx]]. 

[[Image:300- Leonidas and Xerxes discuss surrender.jpg|thumb|thumb|225px|left|Xerxes encourages Leonidas to surrender]]
Before the battle starts, the Persians ask that the 300 drop their arms. Leonidas responds: "Persians! [[Molon labe|Come and get them]]!" The Spartans use the phalanx formation, the narrow terrain, and their fighting skill with shield, spear and sword to effectively fight off numerically superior waves of attackers, driving the regular Persian infantry off of a cliff and withstanding a cavalry charge without any losses. Xerxes, impressed after the two armies' first engagement, personally approaches Leonidas and attempts to bribe him with wealth and power in exchange for his surrender. The Spartan king declines, saying that he will instead make the "[[Divine king|God King]]" bleed. The Spartans then face the [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]], losing a few of their number to the Persian elite guards but still defeating them, with Leonidas personally killing the Uber-Immortal. The Spartans prevail over other types of troops from the vast reaches of the Persian empire, including Mongolian barbarians and their rhinos, soldiers with explosive grenades, and Indian war elephants. However, their last victory is overshadowed by the death of Captain Artemis' eldest son Astinos. Two days after the fighting begins, an embittered Ephialtes reveals the location of the goat path to Xerxes, having been promised a lucrative and powerful position in the Persian Empire.

Back in Sparta, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]], upon the advice of a loyal councilman, attempts to enlist the influential Theron to help her persuade the Spartan council to send reinforcements to Leonidas. Theron agrees to help, but demands that Gorgo submit sexually to him; Gorgo reluctantly consents to his advances. Meanwhile, the Greeks realize that Ephialtes has betrayed them, and the Arcadians decide to retreat in the face of certain death. The Spartans refuse to follow, [[Battle of Thermopylae#Epitaph of Simonides|obedient to their law]]. Leonidas orders only one man, Dilios, to retreat and use his rhetorical skills to tell the story of the 300 to the Spartan people, ensuring that they be remembered. Dilios reluctantly leaves with the Arcadians. At Sparta, Queen Gorgo appears in front of the council, but is not supported by Theron, who furthermore accuses her of adultery. The Queen, enraged at this betrayal, snatches a sword from a nearby soldier and kills Theron. When Persian coins fall from his purse, the Council denounces him as a traitor and unites against Persia.

At Thermopylae, the Persians have surrounded the 300 on all sides. Xerxes's [[General Officer|general]] demands their surrender, saying that Leonidas may keep his title as [[Kings of Sparta|King of Sparta]] and become [[warlord]] of all Greece, answerable only to Xerxes. Ephialtes begs him to do so as well; Leonidas quips back "may you live forever" (the ultimate Spartan insult, as they wish to die in battle). After feinting submission Leonidas orders his man to cut down the general, causing Xerxes to order his troops to attack. The remaining Spartans are killed in the hail of arrows; Leonidas finally falls, but not before delivering on his promise to "make the 'God King' bleed", wounding him on the cheek with a thrown spear. The Persian king is visibly shaken at this reminder of his own mortality. Dilios eventually returns to Sparta and inspires the council with the bravery of the 300.

Dilios finishes his tale on a new battlefield surrounded by raptly listening soldiers. He concludes that the Persian army, who lost countless numbers defeating a mere 300 Spartans a year earlier, must now be terrified to face 10,000 Spartans and 30,000 Greeks from the other [[city-state]]s. The roused Greek host charges the Persian army, beginning the [[Battle of Plataea]].

Producer Gianni Nunnari was not the only person planning a film about the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]; director [[Michael Mann (film director)|Michael Mann]] already planned a film of the battle based on the book ''[[Gates of Fire]]''.

Two months of [[pre-production]] were required to create hundreds of shields, spears and swords, some of which were recycled from ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' and ''[[Alexander (film)|Alexander]]''. An [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were also created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers.<ref name="SHH set visit">{{cite news |last= Douglas |first= Edward |title= ''300'': The Set Visit! |publisher= SuperHeroHype.com |date= [[2007-01-05]] |url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/300news.php?id=5064 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

{{main|300 (soundtrack)}}

In July 2005, composer [[Tyler Bates]] had begun work on the film, describing the score as having, "beautiful themes on the top and large choir," but "tempered with some extreme heaviness." The composer had scored for a test scene that the director wanted to show to Warner Bros. to illustrate the path of the project. Bates said that the score had "a lot of weight and intensity in the low end of the percussion" that Snyder found agreeable to the film.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel Robert |last=Epstein |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/tylerbates_music/interview.asp | title=Exclusive Interview with Tyler Bates, Score Composer for ''The Devil's Rejects'' |publisher=[[UGO]] |date=[[2005-07-13]] |accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] and features the vocals of [[Azam Ali]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Warner Bros.

The score has given rise to some controversy in the film composer community, garnering criticism for its striking similarity to several other recent soundtracks, including [[James Horner]] and [[Gabriel Yared]]'s work for the film ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]''. The heaviest borrowings are allegedly from [[Elliot Goldenthal]]'s 1999 [[Titus (soundtrack)|score]] for ''[[Titus (film)|Titus]]''. "Remember Us," from ''300'', is identical in parts to the "Finale" from ''Titus'', and "Returns a King" is similar to the cue "Victorius Titus."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musiconfilm.net/get_review.php?id=163 |title=300 |accessdate=2007-03-18 |author=Justin Bielawa |date=[[2007-02-27]] |publisher=Music On Film}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movie-wave.net/titles/300.html |title=300 |accessdate=2007-03-18 |author=James Southall |publisher=Movie Wave}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://scoremagacine.com/Resenas_det.php?Codigo=715 |title=300 |accessdate=2007-03-18 |author=Demetris Christodoulides |publisher=Score Magazine}}</ref> Commentators have also noted that the melody of "Message for the Queen" is identical to the song "Zajdi, zajdi" from the [[Balkan]]<ref>{{cite news |author=Valentina Gjorgievska |title=Plagijat na "Zajdi, zajdi" vo film za Spartancite |url=http://www.spic.com.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=2&tabid=1&EditionID=235&ArticleID=11013 |publisher=Špic |date=2007-03-27 |accessdate=2007-03-27 |language=Mazedonian}}</ref>. However, on August 3, 2007, Warner Bros.

''300'''s director Zack Snyder stated in an MTV interview that "The events are 90 percent accurate. It's just in the visualization that it's crazy.... I've shown this movie to world-class historians who have said it's amazing. They can't believe it's as accurate as it is." He continues that the film is "an opera, not a documentary. That's what I say when people say it's historically inaccurate".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1554534/20070313/story.jhtml |title='300' Trivia: Albino Giants, Sequel Chances - And Sienna Miller |accessdate=2007-03-23 |author=Josh Horowitz |date=[[2007-03-13]] |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> However he is quoted in a [[BBC News]] story that the film is, at its core "a [[fantasy film]]."<!--<ref>"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcuudK3SPJE</ref>--> He also describes the film's narrator, Dilios, as "a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth."<ref name="scifi" /> 

[[Paul Cartledge]], Professor of [[History of Greece|Greek History]] at [[Cambridge University]], advised the filmmakers on the [[Ancient Greek phonology|pronunciation of Greek]] names, and states that they "made good use" of his published work on Sparta. He praises the film for its portrayal of "the Spartans' heroic code," and of "the key role played by women in backing up, indeed reinforcing, the male martial code of heroic honor," while expressing reservations about its "'West' (goodies) vs 'East' (baddies) polarization."<ref>{{cite news |author=Dan Vergano ||title=This is Sparta?

Ephraim Lytle, assistant professor of Hellenistic History at the [[University of Toronto]], states that ''300'' selectively idealizes Spartan society in a "problematic and disturbing" fashion, as well as portraying the "hundred nations of the Persians" as monsters and non-Spartan Greeks as weak. He suggests that the film's moral universe would have seemed as "bizarre to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] as it does to modern historians."<ref name="Lytle">{{cite news |author=Ephraim Lytle |title=Sparta?

[[Victor Davis Hanson]], formerly professor of Classical history at [[California State University, Fresno]], who wrote the foreword to a 2007 re-issue of the graphic novel, states that the film demonstrates a specific affinity with the original material of [[Herodotus]] in that it captures the martial ethos of ancient Sparta and represents Thermopylae as a "clash of civilizations". He remarks that [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], [[Aeschylus]] and [[Herodotus]] viewed Thermopylae as a battle against "Eastern centralism and collective serfdom", which opposed "the idea of the free citizen of an autonomous polis".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/rev2007-03-07vdh.html |title=With Your Shield or On It |accessdate=2007-03-18 |author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=2007-03-07 |publisher=[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]}}</ref> He further states that the film portrays the battle in a "surreal" manner, and that the intent was to "entertain and shock first, and instruct second."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/VictorDavisHanson/2007/03/22/300_fact_or_fiction |title='300' Fact or Fiction? |accessdate=2007-03-23 |author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=[[2007-03-22]] |publisher=Townhall.com}}</ref>

[[Touraj Daryaee]], associate professor of Ancient History at [[California State University, Fullerton]], criticizes the central theme of the movie, that of "free" and "democracy loving" Spartans against "slave" Persians. Daryaee states that the Achaemenid (Persian) empire hired and paid people regardless of their sex or ethnicity, whereas in fifth-century Athens "less than 14%" of the population participated in [[Democracy|democratic government]], and "nearly 37%" of the population were slaves. He further states that Sparta "was a militaristic monarchy with a council of elders which decided political matters, but it was not a democracy."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranian.com/Daryaee/2007/March/300/index.html |title=Go tell the Spartans |accessdate=2007-03-23 |author=Touraj Daryaee |date=[[2007-03-14]]|publisher=iranian.com}}</ref>

===Controversy===
<!-- ATTENTION! PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING! Please present potential changes to this section in the Discussion area prior to making them, as consensus has been reached on a number of issues that tend to be repeated here. -->

Prior to the release of ''300'', Warner Brothers expressed concerns about the political aspects of the film's theme. Snyder relates that "There was a huge sensitivity about East versus West with the studio."<ref>{{cite news |author=Sheigh Crabtree |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-ca-3004mar04,1,6828604.story |title=Giving '300' movie a comic-book grandeur |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=[[2007-03-04]] |accessdate=2007-03-08 }}</ref>
Media speculation about a possible parallel between the Greco-Persian conflict and current events began in an interview with Snyder that was conducted before the Berlin Film Festival.<ref name="politics">{{cite news |author=Michael Cieply |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/movies/05spartans.html |title=That Film's Real Message?

Outside the current political parallels, some critics have raised more general questions about the film's ideological orientation. The ''[[New York Post]]'''s  [[Kyle Smith]] writes that the film would have pleased "[[Adolf Hitler|Adolf]]'s boys,"<ref>{{cite news |author=Kyle Smith |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03092007/entertainment/movies/persian_shrug_movies_kyle_smith.htm |title=Persian Shrug |publisher=[[New York Post]] |date=[[2007-03-09]] |accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> and [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s Dana Stevens compares the film to [[The Eternal Jew (film)|''The Eternal Jew'']], "as a textbook example of how race-baiting fantasy and nationalist myth can serve as an incitement to total war".<ref name="Slate">{{cite news |author=Dana Stevens |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2161450/ |title=A Movie Only a Spartan Could Love |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=[[2007-03-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> Roger Moore, a critic for the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', matches ''300'' to [[Susan Sontag]]'s definition of "[[fascist]] art."<ref>{{cite news |author=Roger Moore |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2007/03/300_as_fascist_.html |title=300 as Fascist Art |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=[[2007-03-07]] |accessdate=2007-03-16 }}</ref> 

However, ''[[Newsday]]'' critic Gene Seymour stated that such reactions are misguided, writing that "the movie's just too darned silly to withstand any ideological theorizing."<ref>{{cite news |author=Gene Seymour |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/ny-etlede5121896mar09,0,2850452.story?coll=ny- |title=On the field of this battle, war is swell |publisher=[[Newsday]] |date=[[2007-03-09]] |accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> Snyder himself dismissed ideological readings, suggesting that reviewers who critique a "graphic novel movie about a bunch of guys...stomping the snot out of each other" using words like " 'neocon,' 'homophobic,' 'homoerotic' or 'racist' " are "missing the point."<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonah Weiland|title="300" Post-game: One-on-one with Zack Snyder |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=[[2007-03-14]]|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=9982|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>

The film's portrayal of ancient [[Persian people|Persians]] caused a particularly strong reaction in [[Iran]].<ref name=hnn>{{cite news |author=Gary Leupp|title=A Racist and Insulting Film - 300 vs. Iran (and Herodotus| url=http://www.counterpunch.org/leupp03312007.html|publisher=COUNTERPUNCH|date=[[2007-03-31]] |accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref>  [[Azadeh Moaveni]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that [[Tehran]] was "outraged" following the film's release.

[[Slovenia]]n philosopher and author [[Slavoj Žižek]] defended the movie from those who attacked it as an example of "the worst kind of patriotic militarism with clear allusions to recent tensions with Iran and Iraq." He wrote that the story represents a "poor, small country (Greece) invaded by the army of a much larger state (Persia)," suggesting that the identification of the Spartans with a modern superpower is flawed. Instead of seeing a "fundamentalist" aspect in the Spartan identity, he stated that "all modern egalitarian radicals, from [[Rousseau]] to the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]]…imagined the republican France as a new Sparta".<ref name="The ">{{cite web|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizhollywood.htm|last = Žižek|first = Slavoj| author-link = Slavoj Žižek| title = The True Hollywood Left| publisher = www.lacan.com}}</ref> 

In response to the criticisms, a Warner Bros. spokesman stated that the film ''300'' "is a work of fiction inspired by the Frank Miller graphic novel and loosely based on a historical event. The studio developed this film purely as a fictional work with the sole purpose of entertaining audiences; it is not meant to disparage an ethnicity or culture or make any sort of [[political statement]]."<ref name="hnn" />

==Popular culture==
''300'' has been [[parody|spoofed]] in various media, spawning the "this is Sparta!" [[internet meme]],<ref>{{cite web | author= Steve Spalding | url= http://howtosplitanatom.com/news/how-to-explore-internet-memes/ | title=How To Explore Internet Memes | publisher=[http://howtosplitanatom.com How to Split an Atom] | date=[[2007-09-30]] | accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref> with parodies also appearing in film and television. These include the [[Short subject|short]] ''[[United 300]]'', which won the Movie Spoof Award at the [[MTV Movie Awards 2007|2007 MTV Movie Awards]].
