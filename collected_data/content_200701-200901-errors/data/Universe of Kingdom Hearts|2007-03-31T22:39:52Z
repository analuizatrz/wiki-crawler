[[Square Enix]]'s [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|'''''Kingdom Hearts''''' series]] features an [[outer space]]-like world map with numerous self-contained worlds to explore over the course of play. Many of these worlds are based on animated [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] movies though ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' introduced some worlds based on live action Disney films. Sora's [[Kingdom Hearts|first journey]] takes him through each world to lock their keyholes and prevent the [[Heartless]] from destroying them. On [[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories|his trip]] through Castle Oblivion, he revisits memory based versions of many of these worlds. In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Sora helps the residents of these worlds again in search of his friend Riku. These worlds are visited via Gummi Ship save the 100 Acre Wood, Castle Oblivion, Timeless River and Space Paranoids.

==Destiny Islands==
[[Image:Destinyisland.jpg|thumb|left|The smallest of the Destiny Islands, where the children play]]
The {{nihongo|'''Destiny Islands'''|デスティニーアイランド|Desutinī Airando}} are featured in all three games, though unplayable in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. They form an original world created for the Kingdom Hearts series. This is where [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]], [[Kairi (Kingdom Hearts)|Kairi]], and their friends [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Tidus|Tidus]], [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Wakka|Wakka]], and [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Selphie|Selphie]] grew up.

The islands are an [[archipelago]] that consists of several land masses, the smallest of which is the island where the children go to play. Close enough to the main islands to be reached by small boats, this is an idyllic haven for Sora and his friends to get away from adults and enjoy the island sunshine. The keyhole of the islands is located here in a small cave which Riku discovered as a boy. The main island is a regular town with a school. A superstition of the island is the power of the paopu fruit which is said to bind together the destinies of any two people who share one.

One day, Sora finds himself in a strange dark world where an ominous voice tells him of dangers to come and a door that he will open. He battles creatures of darkness here, culminating in a fight with an immense Darkside Heartless. As the darkness consumes him, Sora wakes up on the beach to see his friends Kairi and Riku. They had been planning to build a raft to sail away to other worlds and they need to gather supplies for the journey. After a two days' work, they are ready. That night, a storm gathers over the children's island and Sora goes to check it out. He finds the island infested with the same dark creatures from his dream, but he is unable to defeat them. Riku, who had also gone to the island, beckons to Sora but tendrils of darkness wrap around them. As Sora is again nearly swallowed by the darkness, a key-shaped weapon appears in his hand and gives him the power to defeat the attacking creatures. In the secret cave, Sora finds Kairi but her spectre simply passes through him and he is swept away by a powerful dark force. He then confronts another Darkside Heartless before the islands are completely destroyed.

[[Image:Destinyislandstown.jpg|thumb|left|The town on the main island]]
After the sealing of the door to Kingdom Hearts, the Destiny Islands are restored and Kairi is returned there, without Sora's or Riku's companionship. After quiet living on the island and [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Naminé|Naminé's]] meddling, Kairi's memories of Sora fade. A year passes and suddenly Kairi begins to remember him as the chains of Sora's memories are restored. In response, Kairi sends a message in a bottle to Sora. While hoping for more news of him, she is confronted by [[Organization XIII#VIII. Axel|Axel]], a member of Organization XIII. Panicked, she follows a dog named [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Pluto|Pluto]] through a dark portal to Twilight Town.

Kairi is eventually rescued and returned after Sora's assault on the World That Never Was. In the aftermath of the battle, Sora and Riku are trapped in the realm of darkness. As they wonder what to do, they find Kairi's letter in a bottle which opens the Door to Light. They travel through the door and find themselves back in their home with their friends.

==Disney Castle==
[[Image:Disneycastle.jpg|thumb|right|Disney Castle]]
{{nihongo|'''Disney Castle'''|ディズニーキャッスル|Dizunī Kyassuru}} is the home to many classic Disney characters including [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#King Mickey|Mickey]], [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Donald Duck|Donald]] and [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Goofy|Goofy]]. It is based on various castles created throughout Disney's history, particularly the ones found in Disney's logo and [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]. Disney Castle was originally meant to be playable in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and its icon appears on the world map but the area was removed due to time constraints. It was added as a playable world in ''Kingdom Hearts II''.

Disney Castle is a peaceful kingdom ruled by King Mickey, a wise and kind ruler, and his queen, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Queen Minnie|Minnie Mouse]]. Many different people reside in this realm, but all are kept happy and safe by the benevolent monarchy. Unfortunately for the kingdom, Mickey has been absent for more than a year, having left without warning at the outset of the first wave of the Heartless. Life continues under the guidance of Queen Minnie and her lady-in-waiting, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Daisy Duck|Daisy Duck]], who watch over the land in the king's absence.

[[Image:Disneycastle-courtyard.jpg|thumb|left|The courtyard inside the castle]]
In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Queen Minnie summons Donald and Goofy back to the castle because of the sudden appearance of Heartless inside the castle. There, she meets Sora for the first time. Minnie then asks Sora to escort her to the throne room while Donald and Goofy check on the other occupants. Here, Minnie reveals the reason for her summons. The Cornerstone of Light, a magical artifact which protects the world from darkness, was covered in gigantic thorns, weakening its power to ward off Heartless. It is revealed that Maleficent is using a magical door to the past to remove the Cornerstone and capture the castle.

During KH2:Final Mix, an dimenional gap appeared, leading to a desert where Sora encounters the Enigmatic Warrior.

===Timeless River===
[[Image:Timelessriver.png|thumb|right|Timeless River]]
Based on [[Steamboat Willie]] and other early Disney [[cartoon]]s of that era, {{nihongo|'''Timeless River'''|タイムレス・リバー|Taimuresu Ribā}} is the "[[past]]" of Disney Castle, shortly before it was built. This world is accessed via the door Merlin created in the Hall of the Cornerstone chamber in ''Kingdom Hearts II''.

The world has many throwback effects including intentionally poor sound quality to imitate old cartoons. In this grayscale world, Sora's character model is simplified, appearing like a 1960s [[Osamu Tezuka]]-style character, while Goofy and Donald Duck revert to their original designs from when they first appeared in Disney cartoons. Past versions of many Disney characters also appear including [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Pete|Pete]] and King Mickey, who Pete refers to as the "boat-boy king", a reference to his previous employment on Pete's steamboat. Timeless River also contains reenactments of some popular Mickey Mouse cartoons with locations such as Lilliput and Scene of the Fire.

Exploring Timeless River, Sora encounters "Past-Pete", mistaking him for his more nefarious present day counterpart. Through exploring mysterious floating stage curtain theaters, the origins of Timeless River become apparent. It turns out that Present-Pete found a door to Timeless River in Maleficent's castle which prompts Maleficent to try to remove the Cornerstone of Light in order to take over Disney Castle. After Present-Pete steals Past-Pete's steamboat, Past-Pete reconciles with Sora and company to defeat Present-Pete.

==Traverse Town==
[[Image:Tt dist.2.jpg|thumb|right|Traverse Town]]
{{nihongo|'''Traverse Town'''|トラヴァースタウン|Toravāsu Taun}} is an original world featured in ''Kingdom Hearts'', acting as a Headquarters of sorts for Sora during his journey. Its architecture is reminiscent of the High Victorian [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style popular in England during the 19th century. Shrouded in perpetual nighttime, Traverse Town was created from fragments of the worlds destroyed by the Heartless. It serves as a home for people who manage to escape the destruction of their own worlds by unknowingly drifting through ''corridors of darkness''.

Traverse Town is separated into three major districts. The First District is generally devoid of Heartless and houses the synthesis and accessory shops, as well as a gummi item shop. There is also a coffeehouse area and mailbox. The world exit is located here. The Second District contains the bell tower, a gizmo shop and a small hotel. The world's keyhole is located in the fountain in this district. It also has the entrance to the Dalmatians' house. The Third District is a plaza that has been overrun with Heartless. This district leads to a guarded alcove where [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Merlin|Merlin]] lives. It also is where Leon and his allies have their secret hideout. Aside from these areas, Traverse Town also has a sewer system where Leon practices his swordplay and a back alley behind the hotel.

After Maleficent conquers Hollow Bastion using Heartless, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Cid|Cid]] takes [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Leon|Leon]], [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Yuffie|Yuffie]] and [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Aerith|Aerith]] to Traverse Town by gummi ship as well. After the Destiny Islands are destroyed, Sora finds himself alone in an alley of the First District. He meets Cid in the Accessory Shop  who explains to him the nature of Traverse Town. He then meets Leon, Yuffie and Aerith who explain to him the power of his Keyblade. While exploring Traverse Town, he awkwardly meets Donald and Goofy in Third District and joins them to fight off a powerful Guard Armor Heartless. Donald and Goofy had been searching for a "key" at their king's behest and find Sora's Keyblade to be a perfect match. Leon tells Sora to travel with Donald and Goofy if he wants to find his friends. After exploring several worlds, Sora recounts his exploits to Leon and the others who ask him to seal the keyholes of each world to prevent their destruction by the Heartless. Sora then investigates the bell tower of Second District to reveal and seal the world's keyhole, but not after a battle with the Opposite Armor Heartless.

==Wonderland==
[[Image:Queencastle.jpg|thumb|left|The Queen's Castle in Wonderland]]
{{nihongo|'''Wonderland'''|ワンダーランド|Wandārando}}, based on Disney's thirteenth [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|animated feature]], ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', is featured in ''Kingdom Hearts'' as one of the first worlds visited on Sora's journey. It is a whimsical world of unreliable physics and irrefutable illogic. Its colorful inhabitants seem to speak in riddles and code. Wonderland is ruled by the despotic [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Queen of Hearts|Queen of Hearts]].

The most dominant feature of Wonderland's entrance is the Bizarre Room. Many of the items here can be pushed flat into the walls and strange potions here can change Sora's size. The next area is the Queen's Castle where most of her courtly functions are carried out. A verdant hedgemaze surrounds this area. Connected to the courtyard is the Lotus Forest, where flowers talk and trees move for inexplicable reasons. Near the rear of the forest is the Tea Party Garden where an extravagant feast is laid out for seemingly no one. Throughout the world are hidden entrances to the Bizarre Room which have irrational effects on the direction of its gravity.

As Sora enters Wonderland, he stumbles upon the trial of [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Alice|Alice]], who was being prosecuted for attempting to steal the Queen's heart. Sensing Alice's innocence, Sora volunteers to find evidence of the real thief. With the help of the [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Cheshire Cat|Cheshire Cat]], Sora finds that the real thief is a Heartless but even during the trial the Queen refuses to believe them and calls her [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Card of Hearts, Card of Spades|guards]] (when Sora presents his pieces of evidence in court, the Queen also presents her own. The player must then select one piece at random and unless it is Sora's and not the Queen's, Donald and Goofy are trapped behind a makeshift cage, preventing them from assisting Sora. They are released after the battle if jailed.). Following the battle, they discover that Alice has gone missing. Searching the rest of Wonderland, they reveal the root of its darkness, a Trickmaster Heartless. After its defeat, Sora finds and seals the world's keyhole, hidden inside the [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Doorknob|Doorknob's]] mouth.

==Olympus Coliseum==
[[Image:Olympus coliseum.jpg|thumb|right|Olympus Coliseum]]
{{nihongo|'''Olympus Coliseum'''|オリンポスコロシアム|Orinposu Koroshiamu}} is featured in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and returns in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. It is based on Disney's thirty-fifth animated feature, ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''. The Coliseum is protected by the might of [[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]] and antagonized by the wily [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]]. Sora trains here and can compete in various tournaments.

Olympus Coliseum is rather sparse in ''Kingdom Hearts'', consisting of only the main entrance, a lobby and the coliseum itself. In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Hades opens a portal to the Underworld near the exit of the Coliseum. The Underworld consists of its own "lobby" which is one boat ride across the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] to the Underdrome, the Underworld's equivalent to the Coliseum, the Lost Road to the Lock and the Cave of the Dead which leads to Hades' Chamber. All of these Underworld areas are infested with Heartless, as well as mysterious white puffs of smoke.

Sora's first visit to Olympus Coliseum prompts his desire to enter a tournament there. He proves himself to [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Philoctetes|Phil]] by passing his training exercises but he is still barred from participation. As Sora curses his luck, Hades appears to him and generously offers a ticket into the games. It seems that Hades has bribed [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Cloud|Cloud]] into assassinating Hercules in exchange for his light. During their fight, Cloud refuses to kill Sora. Frustrated at his plan's failure, Hades unleashes [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Cerberus|Cerberus]] onto the Coliseum. Hercules fights alone while protecting Cloud. As he gradually wears down, Sora rushes in to allow Hercules and Cloud to escape. Sora defeats Cerberus and he and his friends are dubbed "Junior Heroes" by Phil. He later returns to seal the keyhole of Olympus Coliseum, hidden under a stone block in the lobby.

[[Image:Theunderworldkh2.jpg|thumb|left|The Underworld]]
When Sora returns to Olympus Coliseum in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', he finds [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Megara|Meg]], being attacked by Heartless. Meg asks Sora to convince Hades to stop sending monsters to the Coliseum to exhaust Hercules.  When Sora arrives, he sees Hades summoning [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Auron|Auron]] in another attempt to assassinate Hercules. Auron refuses Hades' terms, provoking his rage. Hades' powers make him invincible while in the Underworld so they have no choice but to run. They escape but Auron mysteriously disappears while Sora is looking for a way to defeat Hades. Hercules suggests the Olympus Stone to protect him from the Underworld curse. He discovers that it was recently stolen by an Organization XIII member and that Meg has been captured by Hades. Venturing back into the Underworld, Sora encounters [[Organization XIII#IX. Demyx|Demyx]] and reclaims the Olympus Stone. Sora then rescues Meg by defeating Pete with Hercules' help. But Hades' real plan is discovered when they return to the Coliseum to find it destroyed by the [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#The Hydra|Hydra]]. Sora teams up with the entire gang to defeat the Hydra but Hercules' spirit is crushed by his failure.

When Sora returns, Hercules is still feeling down when Hades opens his "Hades Cup". Sora and Hercules battle through each round but Hercules still blames himself. Sora then overhears a conversation between Hades and Auron which reveals that Hades is controlling Auron by sealing his soul in a statue. Sora sneaks into Hades' Chamber to recover the statue and returns it to Auron in time to save Hercules from an untimely demise. Hades nearly kills Meg but Hercules saves her in time, restoring his confidence. Then, the three team up to defeat Hades once again. After the battle, Sora and company's constellation appears in the sky, promoting them to real heroes.

==Deep Jungle==
[[Image:Deepjunglekh.jpg|thumb|right|Deep Jungle]]
{{nihongo|'''Deep Jungle'''|ディープジャングル|Dīpu Janguru}} is based on Disney's thirty-seventh animated feature, ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'', and is featured in ''Kingdom Hearts''. It is a lush [[jungle|tropical forest]] of diverse animals and exotic plants. The primary inhabitants of this world are [[gorilla]]s, who live in the secretive corners of the jungle and resist intrusion. An exploratory party has arrived to study them but its guide, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Clayton|Clayton]], has other plans. The jungle is also home to [[hippopotamus|hippos]] and other jungle creatures, including the Heartless' mimicry of the local animals. Travelling in this world is done by climbing up trees and jumping onto vines.

Much of the world is covered with dense jungle but some areas have signs of civilized inhabitance. There is an abandoned treehouse near the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] that contains the remains of a previous visitor to the world. Also, the camp set up by Clayton contains many conveniences including stoves and slide projectors. The Bamboo Thicket near the camp ultimately leads to the beautiful Waterfall Cave, a secluded place that hides the world's keyhole.

As Sora, Donald and Goofy debate searching this world, their gummi ship loses control and they crash onto the jungle planet. Sora is accosted by [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Sabor|Sabor]] but an ape-man called [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Tarzan|Tarzan]] saves him and joins Sora's party. He takes Sora to the camp to meet [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Jane Porter|Jane]] before allowing him to see [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Kerchak|Kerchak]], the gorilla leader. Kerchak is not pleased with Tarzan's dealings with the humans and silently ignores Tarzan's good will. Sora is ambushed several more times by Sabor before he is finally defeated. A more sinister plot is revealed when Clayton attacks in order to get to the gorillas. Clayton's greed allowed him to control a powerful Stealth Sneak Heartless but he is finally killed when the defeated Heartless crushes him. The grateful gorillas allow Sora into the Waterfall Cave where he finds and seals the keyhole.

==Agrabah==
[[Image:Agrabahkh2.png|thumb|right|The city of Agrabah]]
{{nihongo|'''Agrabah'''|アグラバー|Agurabā}} is an arid desert city featured in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and revisited in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. It is based on the fictional city of Disney's thirty-first animated feature, ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]''. Agrabah's hot climate disguises a world of intrigue, both magical and political, as an evil sorcerer schemes to usurp the throne from the [[sultan]] of the realm. Little is as it seems in this world as it gets turned upside down through the antics of a certain [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Genie|genie]].

The city of Agrabah is primarily made of humble [[adobe]] buildings though the magnificent palace appears to be carved from [[marble]]. It seems that the regular hustle and bustle of the city has been driven off by the Heartless' appearance, leaving the streets eerily empty. Just outside the city walls are the infinite sands of the desert. The desert itself hides many secrets including the Cave of Wonders and the ruins of an ancient civilization, as well as the occasional mechanical relic of said civilization.

Sora and his friends discover Agrabah to be infested with Heartless as they arrive. Upon exploring, they meet [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Princess Jasmine|Princess Jasmine]], who is being hunted by the evil [[vizier]], [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Jafar|Jafar]], and a [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#The Magic Carpet|magic carpet]] which takes them across the desert to the Cave of Wonders. There, they find [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Aladdin|Aladdin]], ambushed by Heartless and sinking into [[quicksand]]. Despite fighting off the first wave of Heartless and saving him from the quicksand, the Heartless continue to appear, prompting Aladdin to use his first wish to banish them. Genie appears and complies so they are able to return to Agrabah. In front of the palace, they catch up with Jafar but he outsmarts them, capturing both Princess Jasmine and Genie's lamp. Aladdin joins Sora to confront Jafar. Inside the Cave of Wonders, they fight and defeat him. As they celebrate, Jafar wishes to become a genie and fights again. Sora grabs the lamp from [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Iago|Iago]], Jafar's sidekick, and traps him inside it. During their battle, Princess Jasmine had been captured by someone else and after locking the world's keyhole, Aladdin asks Sora to find Jasmine for him.

[[Image:Agrabah-treasureroom.png|thumb|left|The treasure room of the Cave of Wonders]]
Upon Sora's return in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', he finds Iago who begs for forgiveness, claiming that he has changed his ways. After inadvertently saving Sora, he has no choice but to believe the bird's intentions. Later, Sora finds Aladdin and [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Abu|Abu]] chasing a [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#The Peddler|peddler]] who happened upon Jafar's lamp. In exchange for the lamp, the Peddler asks for a treasure from the Cave of Wonders. Retrieving the item, the Peddler relinquishes the lamp, but not before Pete makes a bid for it by summoning a pair of powerful Heartless. Defeated, Pete escapes and the lamp is sealed underneath the palace.

When Sora checks up on Agrabah later, he learns that Jafar has been released. Iago leads the party to a set of ruins in the desert to follow a mysterious Jafar-shaped shadow. It is revealed that Iago led them there because of Jafar's threats so that Jafar could wreak havoc upon the city. When they return, they confront the Peddler who admits that he was bribed to keep silent about Jafar's return by an enigmatic man with a black coat. Sora fights Jafar another time and defeats him again, this time, destroying the lamp.

==Monstro==
[[Image:Monstro.jpg|thumb|right|Inside Monstro's stomach]]
{{nihongo|'''[[Monstro]]'''|モンストロ|Monsutoro}} is an enormous [[whale]] from Disney's second animated feature, ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and is featured in ''Kingdom Hearts''. Monstro is not a world unto himself and thus has no keyhole. Rather, his belly is large enough to serve as a substitute world, filled with luminescent [[acid]] and [[blubber]] and with Heartless. Monstro is a hazard to interworld travelers; he swims through the dimensional drift between worlds as if it were water, attacking and swallowing any vessel that passes his way.

Monstro escaped from the world of [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Geppetto|Geppetto]] and [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Pinocchio|Pinocchio]] just before it was destroyed by the Heartless. Geppetto finds himself inside Monstro's belly while searching for his "son," Pinocchio. Monstro's anatomically disoriented insides consist of two major parts. His enormous mouth contains many of the ships he has swallowed over the years, including Geppetto's. His throat leads to his Heartless-filled intestines, which are a sickly purple color with vessels and valves separating the body cavities.

Sora, Donald and Goofy are swallowed by the huge whale while traveling in their gummi ship on their quest to seal keyholes. Inside, they meet Pinocchio and Geppetto who have been inside the whale for quite a while. Pinocchio is finally reunited with [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Jiminy Cricket|Jiminy Cricket]], the scribe of Sora's journey and Pinocchio's conscience. While chatting with Geppetto, Pinocchio wanders off and Geppetto asks Sora to fetch him. Sora unexpectedly encounters Riku during his search. Riku invites Sora to play hide and seek, running around Monstro's intestines with Pinocchio in tow. A powerful Heartless called Parasite Cage appears and captures Pinocchio but Riku assists in defeating it. After the battle, he and Pinocchio run off again. Sora manages to catch up again and Riku remarks that Kairi has lost her heart and that Pinocchio, a puppet with a heart, may be able to help her. Sora disapproves of Riku's plan to use Pinocchio, but the Parasite Cage reappears before Sora can question him more. Sora kills it and saves Pinocchio again but Riku is nowhere to be found. Eventually, Leon helps Geppetto find a home in Traverse Town with Pinocchio.

==100 Acre Wood==
<!---100 Acre Wood, not Hundred Acre Wood or other variation, according to the illustrated world logo in Kingdom Hearts II.--->
[[Image:Hundred acre wood-pooh's house.jpg|thumb|left|Pooh's House]]
The {{nihongo|'''100 Acre Wood'''|100エーカーの森|Hyaku Ēkā no Mori}} is an optional world based on the [[Hundred Acre Wood|fictional locale]] of author [[A. A. Milne]] and Disney's twenty-second animated feature, ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''. The world takes the form of a magical book located in Merlin's house. As Sora collects Torn Pages, new areas of the 100 Acre Wood become available as the story is retold.

When Sora "enters the book", he lands on a version of the flat map of the 100 Acre Wood featured in many Pooh books. Classic locations such as Pooh's and Piglet's House appear as well as the Muddy Path and Spooky Cave. In each location is usually a [[minigame]] with nominally worthwhile prizes which help Sora on his journey.

The book is first given to Sora by Cid near the beginning of ''Kingdom Hearts'' and he collects Torn Pages throughout the game until he finds and seals the 100 Acre Wood's keyhole. Along the way, he makes friends with each of the Wood's inhabitants, particularly [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Winnie the Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]], with whom he plays a [[Christopher Robin]]-like role. In Kingdom Hearts II Merlin moves to Hollow Bastion and takes the book with him. When Sora returns, he excitedly enters the book to check up on his friends. While he is greeting Pooh, he is suddenly ejected from the book as the Heartless try to steal it. During the battle to recover the book, it is damaged. Upon return, Sora finds Pooh with severe [[amnesia]], unable to remember him. Sora then continues to find Torn Pages which slowly restore Pooh's memory. Shortly after fully repairing the book, Sora admits that he has to leave again but reassures Pooh that they will always be in each other's hearts.

==Atlantica==
[[Image:Atlanticakingdomhearts.jpg|thumb|left|Atlantica]]
{{nihongo|'''Atlantica'''|アトランティカ|Atorantika}}, based on Disney's twenty-eighth animated feature, ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', is an underwater kingdom introduced in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and revisited in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. Ruled by [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#King Triton|King Triton]] and his powerful magic trident, its inhabitants are [[mermaid]]s and sea creatures. While here, Sora's legs become a [[dolphin]]'s tail, Donald's legs become [[octopus]] tentacles and Goofy's body becomes that of a [[sea turtle]]. In Kingdom Hearts II there is no battling in Atlantica, it only serves as a musical world.

The main city of Atlantica is the only "constructed" area, made of what appears to be [[coral]] and other underwater vegetation. King Triton's chamber can be found here. Outside the city is the Undersea Gorge, which is a sort of hub to other areas. Here can be found Ariel's Grotto, a secret place where Princess [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Ariel|Ariel]] stores her human artifacts. Also, a path from here leads to a rotting sunken ship that has become the home to many sea creatures. A more sinister area of the sea can be accessed from here: the Den of Tides and the sea witch [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Ursula|Ursula]]'s lair.

Entering Atlantica, Donald uses his magic to transform Sora, Goofy and himself into more underwater-friendly forms. There, he meets Ariel, Triton's youngest daughter, who teaches Sora how to swim and joins his party. Ariel suggests that they visit King Triton in the palace. Triton accuses Sora and his friends of being responsible for the appearance of the Heartless in Atlantica. Ariel escapes to her grotto in protest. She shows her collection of human items to Sora which calms her down greatly. They go out exploring, finding a trident-shaped crystal in a sunken ship that fits into a similar-shaped hole in Ariel's Grotto. Before the team could insert it properly, King Triton destroys the crystal and correctly asserts that Sora and his friends are from a different world, rather than a "different ocean" as they claimed. Distraught, Ariel storms off again, only to be persuaded by Ursula to be a pawn in her plan in exchange for the chance to visit other worlds. Ursula steals the trident and Sora goes to her lair to confront her. After a first defeat, she uses the trident's power to grow to enormous size. Finally, Ursula is defeated, returning the trident to its rightful owner. Admitting fault, Triton reveals Atlantica's keyhole and allows Sora to seal it.

After the sealing of the door to Kingdom Hearts, the Heartless population in Atlantica diminishes significantly, warded off by the trident's power. When Sora returns to Atlantica, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Sebastian|Sebastian]], Triton's court composer, asks him to participate in the year's annual music festival. As rehearsals begin, Ariel saves a human prince named [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Prince Eric|Eric]] from a [[shipwreck]] and falls in love. Displeased and suspicious with her attitude, King Triton orders Sebastian to make Ariel forget about the human world. Ursula takes advantage of the opportunity and turns Ariel into a human in exchange for her voice. Taking the form of a human, Ursula uses Ariel's voice to hypnotise Eric until Sora reveals her ruse. Unfortunately, Ariel's contract forces King Triton to hand over the trident which Ursula once again uses to try to conquer the ocean. Sora and Eric manage to kill Ursula and Triton finally accepts his daughter's wishes.

==Halloween Town==
[[Image:Halloween town 2.jpg|thumb|right|Oogie Boogie's manor]]
{{nihongo|'''Halloween Town'''|ハロウィンタウン|Harowin Taun}} is an eternally dark village featured in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and returns in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. It is based on [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', a [[stop motion]] animated film released by [[Touchstone Pictures]]. The residents of Halloween Town are obsessed with their [[Halloween|eponymous holiday]] and each year, they seek to outdo the last year's celebration. Though it has a [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#The Mayor|mayor]], the de facto leader of Halloween Town is the Pumpkin King, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Jack Skellington|Jack Skellington]]. Using Donald's magic, Sora, Donald and Goofy disguise themselves as spooky characters to blend in with the Halloween Town folk.

Halloween Town's nexus is Guillotine Square, which has entrances to [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Dr. Finklestein|Dr. Finklestein's]] lab, Jack Skellington's house and the Graveyard. The Graveyard has been overrun by Halloween-themed Heartless and leads to Moonlight Hill. A secret switch in Moonlight Hill allows access to [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Oogie Boogie|Oogie Boogie's]] Manor. The back of the Graveyard also houses a forest called the Hinterlands. Here, several trees with strange symbols lead to other holiday-themed towns. The most prominent is [[Christmas]] Town, where [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Santa Claus|Santa Claus]] lives and has his workshop.

Sora and company arrive in Halloween Town to the sight of docile Heartless. Upon visiting Dr. Finklestein's lab, they discover that Jack is trying to use the Heartless in their upcoming Halloween festival. He is unsatisfied with their movements so he needs to make an artificial heart in order to properly control them. Jack joins Sora to gather the ingredients but the heart is stolen by [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Lock, Shock and Barrel|Lock, Shock and Barrel]] under the orders of Oogie Boogie. They go to his manor to confront him. Oogie eats the heart, thinking that he will be able to summon Heartless with it. He succeeds, but only manages to generate a few measly foot soldiers. After his defeat, Oogie's heart suddenly brims with darkness, eerily fusing with his manor for a second fight with Sora. Sora defeats him once again and locks the world's keyhole hidden in the moon's shadow.

Sora returns to Halloween Town in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' to discover Jack's plans of running Christmas this year. He takes the gang to Christmas Town to see Santa Claus who is anything but happy to see Jack. It seems that a previous attempt to run Christmas has soured Santa's opinion of Jack. As they converse, a commotion in the factory alerts an intruder's presence. Lock, Shock and Barrel have been up to no good again and their [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Bathtub|bathtub getaway vehicle's]] footprints lead back to Moonlight Hill. After the Prison Cage Heartless they summon is soundly beaten, the trio reveals that Oogie Boogie has been revived by Maleficent. Sally also arrives and delivers the news that Santa has been kidnapped by Oogie. Sora and the team go to Santa's workshop and kill Oogie another time and save Christmas. As a parting gift, Santa brings Jack to his senses about the true meaning of holidays.

Later, Sora finds that a mysterious thief is stealing presents from Santa's factory. Jack vehemently denies the charges and resolves to clear his name. Confronting Lock, Shock and Barrel, they are found to be innocent as well. Jack devises a scheme to lure the thief out with decoy presents. Hiding in a large gift box, Sora and company surprise the thief who turns out to be a [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#the Experiment|robot]] that Dr. Finklestein created to chaperon Lock, Shock and Barrel. The robot, not having a heart, thought that presents would be able to give it a heart since giving gifts is a way of giving one's heart to someone. Unfortunately, the Experiment had to be destroyed. Sally makes this revelation and tells Jack that all she really wants is to spend more time with him.

In the forth coming Final Mix version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Sora's Halloween outfit will be replaced by a Christmas outfit. It seems to be a mixture of both Christmas and Halloween themes, Sora wears a black Santa suit with red ribbons wrapped around his legs, while still supporting his dark Halloween makeup.

==Neverland==
<!---Neverland, not Never Land or other variation according to the illustrated world logo in Kingdom Hearts.--->
[[Image:Neverlandkh.jpg|thumb|right|The Clock Tower in London, which can be accessed from Neverland]]
{{nihongo|'''Neverland'''|ネバーランド|Nebārando}} is a world featured in ''Kingdom Hearts'', based on locations from Disney's fourteenth animated feature, ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' and author [[J. M. Barrie]]'s [[Neverland|fictional island]]. Anything is possible in Neverland, as long as there is enough belief to make it true. [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Peter Pan|Peter Pan]] sneaks aboard [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Captain Hook|Captain Hook]]'s ship in order to save his friend, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Wendy|Wendy]], whom Captain Hook had captured, believing her to be a Princess of Heart.

Although the world is officially called "Neverland", there are no signs of the timeless island where people do not age. Instead, it primarily consists of Captain Hook's ship, the cabins and decks therein. Also accessible is a large [[clock tower]] which Wendy refers to as "[[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]]".

While traveling on the gummi ship, Sora and his friends are assaulted by a space-worthy [[piracy|pirate]] ship belonging to Captain Hook. Sora finds himself on the deck of the ship, face-to-face with Riku. He reveals that he has finally found Kairi but she has lost her heart. Sora condemns Riku for his use of the Heartless and darkness to pursue his goals but Riku scoffs and drops him into the cargo hold. There, he is reunited with Donald and Goofy and meets Peter Pan. With the pixie [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Tinker Bell|Tinker Bell's]] help, they escape the hold and search for Kairi and Peter Pan's friend, Wendy. Upon reaching the room where Wendy was kept, Peter Pan rudely excuses himself to take her to safety. Sora proceeds to the Captain's Cabin where he battles with a Heartless version of himself that was created by Riku. They defeat it and go to the main deck to discover that Riku has already left. Instead, Captain Hook arrives and forces them to walk the plank. At the last second, Sora finds his ability to fly after hearing Peter Pan's kind words. Peter, who had returned for Sora and his friends, joins forces once again to fight Captain Hook. They defeat him and send him scurrying away from his [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#The Crocodile|crocodile]] nemesis. Flying to the Clock Tower, Sora seals the world's keyhole, located on a clock face.

==Hollow Bastion==
<!--The Radiant Garden, not Radiant Garden or other variation according to the illustrated world logo in Kingdom Hearts II.-->
[[Image:Hollow Bastion.jpg|thumb|left|Hollow Bastion]]
{{nihongo|'''Hollow Bastion'''|ホロウバスティオン|Horō Basution}} is an original world created for the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series which serves as the home to many ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' characters who appear in the series. It is also one of the most important worlds to the storyline because its scope is not limited by a Disney movie. In addition to its role in ''Kingdom Hearts'' as the location of the "final Keyhole", it serves as the hub world of ''Kingdom Hearts II''.

Hollow Bastion is dominated by a castle which, now derelict, once was the world's seat of power. The castle gate is accessed through a moving platform in the Rising Falls. Underneath the entrance are the Waterways which provide plumbing throughout the castle. The Entrance Hall of the castle is directly through its imposing marble doors. A library is here, containing knowledge collected by its former scientists. Also accessible from the Entrance Hall is the Lift Stop, a complex series of elevators which provide transportation to different parts of the castle. Its peculiar construction forces travelers to exit to an exterior portion of the castle called the Great Crest in order to reach the Castle Chapel. The chapel segues to the Grand Hall, the location of the final Keyhole which can only be completed with the help of the seven Princesses of Heart.

Aside from the castle itself, there is a town at its foot which is the base of operations for the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. This town contains a marketplace and borough which lead to the castle bailey. Merlin also relocates here after departing from Traverse Town. Branching from the bailey are two paths. One takes the Ravine Trail through a valley to a bluff with a vista of the Hollow Bastion castle. The other goes through the Reconstruction Site to the Postern at the base of the castle. A previously unknown entrance here leads to Ansem's Study and his computer room.

Hollow Bastion was once a peaceful kingdom called the {{nihongo|'''Radiant Garden'''|レイディアントガーデン|Reidianto Gāden}}, ruled by [[DiZ|Ansem the Wise]]. In his thirst for knowledge, he began studying the darkness in people's hearts, with six apprentices, including [[Xehanort]]. Ansem grew wary of the experiments and stopped them. Unknown to him, his apprentices continued his work, producing the [[Heartless]] from hearts that were overwhelmed by darkness. A chain of events led to Ansem the Wise being banished, Xehanort splitting into two beings, and the world overwhelmed by darkness. Empty, the castle was later adopted by Maleficent as a headquarters.

[[Image:Hollowbastion art.jpg|thumb|right|The castle gate area of Hollow Bastion]]
Sora travels to Hollow Bastion, hot on Riku's trail and eager to see Kairi after their encounter in Neverland. At Maleficent's behest, Riku goes to confront the [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#The Beast|Beast]], who had arrived in Hollow Bastion through the Corridors of Darkness by his sheer will to find Belle, at the Rising Falls. Riku was about to kill Beast when Sora and gain arrived. Believing it to be his destiny, Riku claims the Keyblade from Sora. Donald and Goofy have no choice but to follow the Keyblade with Riku, leaving Sora alone. Beast joins Sora to help him get through the castle. Without his Keyblade, Sora relies on Beast's brute strength to defeat the Heartless guarding the castle door mechanism. As they enter the Entrance Hall, Beast is locked out by a Heartless' trick. Sora encounters Donald and Goofy again who stand by him, even though he no longer has the Keyblade. Sora's strong heart reclaims the Keyblade from Riku and with Donald and Goofy's help, they defeat him.

Traversing through the castle, they make their way to the Castle Chapel. There, they confront Maleficent. After her defeat, Riku appears with a dark Keyblade, constructed of the hearts of the six Princesses of Heart already obtained. He uses its power to unlock Maleficent's heart, filling it with darkness and transforming her into a powerful dragon. A battle ensues but Sora emerges victorious again. He pursues Riku into the Grand Hall. There, Sora finds Kairi's lifeless body and realizes that another being, who refers to himself as Ansem, the seeker of darkness, has possessed Riku's body. Actually Xehanort's Heartless using Riku to regain a physical form, "Ansem" reveals that Kairi's missing heart is inside Sora's body and that it is necessary to complete the final Keyhole. As Xehanort's Heartless prepares to remove Kairi's heart from his body, Sora retaliates and they duel with Sora forcing Xehanort's Heartless to retreat. Sora contemplates what to do and stabs himself with Xehanort's Heartless's dark Keyblade. The Keyblade shatters, returning the hearts of the Princesses of Heart and Kairi's heart emerges from Sora's body. She finally awakens but Sora lost his heart in the act and disappears. With Kairi's heart returned, the Final Keyhole completes itself and a large number of Heartless emerge along with Xehanort's Heartless "remolding" Riku's body in his image. Before he can attack, Riku's heart reasserts itself and prevents Xehanort's Heartless from continuing, allowing Donald, Goofy and Kairi to escape. Sora, now a Shadow Heartless, wanders the castle until he finds Kairi again. Her light returns Sora to normal and Beast holds off the waves of Heartless to allow Sora and the others to escape to Traverse Town. Because of the increasing number of Heartless, conventional gummi routes to Hollow Bastion are impossible to traverse. With the navigation gummi used by Cid to escape Hollow Bastion, Sora takes an alternative route to seal the completed keyhole.

<!---In the first Kingdom Hearts game only, Beast, from [[Beauty and the Beast]], can join Sora, Donald and Goofy when they are in Hollow Bastion.

Radiant Garden was once a peaceful [[kingdom]] ruled by [[DiZ|Ansem the Wise]], a good king who dwelled in the castle Hollow Bastion, and populated by happy people. He was concerned with the spread of darkness in the worlds, and with his six apprentices (all now [[Organization XIII]] members) experimented on the depths of the human heart. [[Xehanort]], his top apprentice from parts unknown, volunteered himself to be a test subject for these experiments. Unbeknownst to Ansem, his six apprentices gathered a great amount of test subjects and began dangerous experiments into the darkness of the heart. While Ansem ordered them to stop their experiments, Xehanort's experiments accidentally created the beings who he called 'Heartless' when he and the apprentices destroyed the hearts of their test subjects. Xehanort, behind his mentor's back, began creating artificial Heartless (known as "Emblems") in the basement beneath Hollow Bastion. Through further study, he uncovered the Keyhole of the Radiant Garden and discovered that behind it lay the world's heart.

On the night that Xehanort glimpsed the heart of this world, he also observed a meteor shower, the products of which were foreign like himself. He quickly concluded that travel between worlds must be possible, but did not know how to accomplish it. On the same night, Ansem was visited by [[Mickey Mouse|King Mickey]]. On Mickey's advice, he decided to re-examine the data from the underground laboratory. He discovered many "Ansem Reports" that carried his name, written by his apprentice, but he had only written the one entitled Ansem Report 0. Ansem quickly learned that Xehnanort deduced that the goal of the Heartless was to find and consume the hearts of all worlds, just as they sought to consume the hearts of living beings.

Ansem's other disciples, Even (now [[Organization XIII#IV. Vexen|Vexen]]), Ienzo (now [[Organization XIII#VI. Zexion|Zexion]]), Braig (now [[Organization XIII#II. Xigbar|Xigbar]]), Dilan (now [[Organization XIII#III. Xaldin|Xaldin]]), and Elaeus (now [[Organization XIII#V. Lexaeus|Lexaeus]]) have ceased to be human, becoming Nobodies. Xehanort later exiled Ansem to the world of nothingness and took his name and place in Hollow Bastion. There, in the world of nothingness, Ansem took on the name DiZ, and became obsessed with revenge. Xehanort was obsessed with his newfound knowledge of darkness, hearts, other worlds, and the Keyblade. He cast off his body and disappeared to search for answers, plunging himself into the darkness without reservation and creating his own Heartless, "Ansem", and Nobody, Xemnas, in the process.

Hollow Bastion is also the home of several beloved [[Final Fantasy]] characters, such as [[Squall Leonhart]] (Leon), [[Cid Highwind]], [[Aerith Gainsborough]], [[Yuffie Kisaragi]], [[Tifa Lockhart]] and [[Cloud Strife]].

In ''Kingdom Hearts'', Maleficent took control over the decayed remains of Hollow Bastion to serve as her base of operations. When Sora and company arrived to find Kairi, they encountered Riku who claims the Keyblade from him. Due to King Mickey's orders to follow the Keyblade bearer, Donald and Goofy unwillingly abandon Sora and follow Riku. Sora makes his way through the castle with the help of Beast, whose strong heart withstood his world's destruction and led him to this world. There, Donald and Goofy rejoin with Sora and battle Riku. Due to the strength of Sora's heart, the Keyblade comes back to him permanently. At the time, Maleficent was gathering the seven [[Princesses of Heart]] to open the Final Keyhole to Kingdom Hearts. Sora and company finally encounter Maleficent in battle and defeat her, but with the help of Xehanort's Heartless who has returned to the castle to witness the opening of the Final Keyhole, she becomes a huge dragon which the party defeats. Riku has now been possessed by Xehanort's Heartless, who still referenced himself as "Ansem, the Seeker of Darkness" at that time, and Sora had to battle a very powerful Riku without his companions. Before this battle, Xehanort's Heartless reveals to Sora that Kairi's heart remained sealed in him. As Destiny Islands was ripped apart, her heart left her body and used Sora's as a vessel. To unlock Kairi's heart, Sora used the Dark Keyblade that Riku possessed on himself. In doing so, Kairi's heart was freed, but his own heart was lost in the process, and he became a Heartless with [[Naminé]] born as a result. Because of Kairi, Sora regained his human body and because of this, [[Organization XIII#XIII. Roxas|Roxas]], the Nobody of Sora, was born without memories of his former self due to Sora's short period of time as a Heartless. Now that the Final Keyhole was completed, Sora and company ventured inside, sealing the Final Keyhole once and for all.-->

Hollow Bastion returns in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'' where Maleficent plans to use both the Beast and Belle for her own ends.

Hollow Bastion plays the biggest role in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', in a similar fashion to that of Traverse Town back in the original game. This time around in the world, Leon, Cid, Yuffie, Merlin, Aerith and others are attempting to rebuild the town. When Sora & Co. arrive, they are asked by Cid to help in the redevelopment.

Despite the world's restoration, Maleficent's temporary base of operations, the Villians' Vale tower, is surrounded by Heartless and the new presence of Nobodies is disturbing the citizens of the town. Upon Sora's arrival in the world, he meets [[Organization XIII]] for the first time (even though he met them a year before, he has since forgotten ever meeting some of their members). It is later that Sora, Donald and Goofy learn who really [[Ansem the Wise]], [[Xehanort]] and [[Xemnas]] are and how they started the events of the entire trouble with the Heartless and meet Tron inside Ansem's computer.

Upon their fifth visit to Hollow Bastion, the Heartless have started a deadly invasion upon the land. Leon, Cloud, Yuffie, Aerith, Tifa, [[Stitch]] and others are battling the millions of Heartless and Sora gets involved. King Mickey advises Sora and his friends to go and look for Riku and Kairi, but the adventurous friends decide to help in the Heartless War first. During the war, Sora and his friends battle and defeat Organization member [[Demyx]], Goofy seemingly dies after being hit by a boulder in an attempt to save Mickey but he was only knocked out, the group meet Xemnas for the first time as well cross paths once more with the rogue [[Organization XIII#VIII. Axel|Axel]], Sora, Donald and Goofy take on and defeat the entire army of Heartless, and they are surprisingly saved by the revived [[Maleficent]]. 

During their final visit, they learn that the [[Master Control Program (Tron)|MCP]] is threatening the town with its own security so the group return to Tron's world and destroy the MCP and save Hollow Bastion. Tron finds some footage of the world in its hayday, and it is renamed Radiant Garden. Sora also has an encounter with [[Sephiroth]] but Cloud soon comes to his rescue.

===Space Paranoids===
[[Image:Spaceparanoids.png|thumb|left|Space Paranoids]]
{{nihongo|'''Space Paranoids'''|スペース・パラノイド|Supēsu Paranoido}} is a world inspired by the [[1982]] live-action [[science fiction]] cult film, ''[[Tron (film)|Tron]]''. Sora & Co. get immersed into a computer world to find clues regarding the past of Hollow Bastion and a caption they found behind Xehanort's portrait in Ansem's Study saying ''Door To Darkness'' a.k.a. ''D.T.D'', fighting alongside [[Tron (character)|Tron]] to defeat the evil [[Master Control Program (Tron)|MCP]] and its equally villainous commander, [[Sark (Tron)|Sark]]. There is also a [[Light Cycle]] mini-game which strongly deviates from the original game. The term ''Space Paranoids'' comes from one of the games Kevin Flynn created in ''Tron''. Tron can join Sora, Donald and Goofy when they enter into the system.

When they first enter the world, Sora and co. are arrested by Sark. They find themselves inside a Pit Cell, where they meet Tron. He then aids them in escaping, asking that they find the password to the Dataspace so that he can reboot himself and challenge the MCP. They succeed, and Tron changes the password from the names of the Princesses of Heart to SoraDonaldGoofy, as a thank you to his new friends. They also battle the [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Hostile Program|Hostile Program]].

Later on, the MCP uses Heartless creation machines to send virtual Heartless into the real world, attacking Hollow Bastion with its own defense systems. The MCP also forces Tron onto the game grid. After Sora and co. rescue him, they head to the I/O Tower to pick up a special Eradicator program developed by [[Cid Highwind]] and [[Merlin]]. They then use the solar sailer to travel to the MCP's mainframe, where they battle Sark. Following this, the MCP appears and enhances Sark, making him larger. The gang then uses the Eradicator program, de-rezzing both the MCP and Sark. Tron bids goodbye to his User friends, sending a thank you to the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee. He then digs up an image of Hollow Bastion as it first was: the paradise of Radiant Garden.

Space Paranoids is only playable in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', and is the most important Disney world story-wise. Tron at one point mentions that Space Paranoids was copied from an existing world designed by ENCOM, the company from the original film. It can be assumed that the Space Paranoids in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' exists alongside the original (though Tron said that the original was deleted).

==End of the World==
[[Image:Endoftheworld3.jpg|thumb|left|End of the World]]
'''End of the World''' is the final world in ''Kingdom Hearts''. This world is made out of the worlds that lost their hearts to the Heartless. It is also the home of [[Chernabog (Fantasia)|Chernabog]], the huge winged demon from the ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'' segment "[[Night on Bald Mountain]]". [[Tetsuya Nomura]] referenced it as the "[[Organization XIII#Nobody|Nobody]]" of worlds. This is supported by the fact that Heartless only want the heart of a world, so once they take the heart and the citizens travel through the corridors of darkness, the physical world itself is destroyed and sent to End of the World, thus the name "End of the World", as it signifies that a world has ended.

Sora and company try to stop Xehanort's Heartless who is proceeding to find Kingdom Hearts to call forth the source of all darkness in order to obtain the knowledge he had sought. Sora, Donald, and Goofy confront him while he had the opportunity to achieve his ultimate goal at the remains of what appears to be the smallest island in the Destiny Islands, and Xehanort's Heartless fights the trio along with a guardian Heartless. Defeated, he opens a giant hole in the island and summons a Darkside Heartless to fight Sora alone, then confronts Sora alone before bonding onto the World of Chaos, a living Heartless ship, and revealing the door to Kingdom Hearts. Despite his efforts, World of Chaos is defeated, and he barely escapes alive. He succeeds in forcing Kingdom Hearts to open. But from it comes a blinding light that envelops and destroys him; in an ironic twist, Xehanort's Heartless vanishes, questioning why there is light in the darkness. With Xehanort's Heartless defeated, the End of the World ceases to be, and all worlds are restored. Kingdom Hearts is then sealed off by Sora and King Mickey, preventing the darkness from escaping.

The World Terminus is also located here, which gives the Heartless access to the corridors of darkness leading to other worlds.

==Castle Oblivion==
[[Image:Castleoblivion.jpg|thumb|right|Castle Oblivion]]
{{nihongo|'''Castle Oblivion'''|忘却の城|Bōkyaku no Shiro}} is a mysterious fortress featured in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories''. The castle itself is thirteen floors high and twelve basements deep. The lord of the castle is [[Organization XIII#XI. Marluxia|Marluxia]], a newer member of [[Organization XIII]]. The castle is decorated with a [[rose]] [[motif (art)|motif]] because Marluxia is a master of the flower element.

Castle Oblivion is dominated by the use of [[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories#Gameplay|cards]]. When entering the castle, one's memories and abilities are quantified into cards. Because of peculiar construction, Castle Oblivion's floors can be transmuted into different forms and layouts through the use of "world cards" derived from one's memories, as well as "map cards" which determine the properties of individual rooms.

World cards based on Agrabah, Olympus Coliseum, Wonderland, Monstro, Atlantica, Halloween Town, Neverland, 100 Acre Wood, Traverse Town, Hollow Bastion, Destiny Islands and Twilight Town have been created from Sora's and Riku's memories.

===Sora's story===
As Sora progresses through Castle Oblivion, his memories start fading but also starts remembering a girl named Naminé. They eventually learn that she is actually a [[witchcraft|witch]] who replaced Sora's memories of Kairi with herself. She also used her power to create "worlds" made to mimic the place he has been before. She did this all under the orders of Marluxia.
Naminè promises to help Sora get his true memories back when they could reach the thirteenth floor. At the top, Sora and Naminè find an odd, flower-like structure made of crystal. Naminè explains that if he sleeps in this, he will get his memories back, but he must forget everything that happened in Castle Oblivion. He is still in the crystal structure as of the beginning of ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', but in the basement of Twilight Town's mansion, as Organization XIII still inhabits the castle.

[[Image:Castleoblivion2.jpg|thumb|right|Inside Castle Oblivion]]

===Riku's story===
: ''Note: Riku's story takes place the same time as and shortly after Sora's story.''
Riku follows a strange voice out of a blank existence; it leads to the basement of Castle Oblivion. Riku receives a card which takes him to Hollow Bastion. There he finds and kills a Maleficent made out of his memories. The voice he heard happened to be [[Xehanort|Xehanort's Heartless]], still thought to be Ansem, who tried to possess him in ''Kingdom Hearts''. He plans on bringing him back into darkness so that he can control Riku again. Naminé tells Riku that his darkness is his own heart, and he shouldn't be afraid to use it. At the highest basement level, he learns that the "Ansem" he met in the castle was in fact [[DiZ]], an enigmatic man who knows a lot about both Riku and the castle, but unfortunately is very vague about this knowledge. DiZ reveals to Riku that the Heartless lurks in his own heart, and gives him a card to draw him out.  After using the card, Riku engages and defeats Xehanort's Heartless. He then leaves the castle with King Mickey, having decided to walk the road to dawn, a path in-between light and darkness.

== Twilight Town ==
{{nihongo|'''Twilight Town'''|トワイライトタウン|Towairaito Taun}} was briefly introduced in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', in which Sora explored the memories of the other side of his heart. By ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', it is a major part in the story where [[Hayner]], [[Pence (Kingdom Hearts)|Pence]], and [[Olette (Kingdom Hearts)|Olette]] reside.<ref> ''Kingdom Hearts II''; Piggyback Interactive Limited. September 2006, ISBN 978-1-903511-89-3.</ref> DiZ created a simulation of the town and its people to keep Roxas in a false sense of security and away from Organization XIII until Sora's restoration was complete. Roxas is playable only in this world.

[[Image:Twilightown.gif|thumb|left|Twilight Town's Clock Tower]]

Twilight Town is split into two parts, the shopping district and the residential district, with a train that connects the two. There is also a huge clock tower in the middle of the town that is part of a train station. This gigantic station is on top of a hill that overlooks the shopping district. The trains from here head to the ocean as well as the Sunset residential district. The [[clock tower]] is seen as the symbol of Twilight Town and is loved by its citizens. Toward the end of summer vacation, the station sets up a campaign of free use of the trains, so the station becomes filled with children.

Following on, in Twilight Town the player is introduced to the second playable character of ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Roxas. He hangs out with the rest of his friends in a little place near the shopping district. At this place we can see sunlight coming in from the cracks. Originally, it seems to have been a passageway, but is now a hideout for Hayner and his friends, Olette and Pence. They've brought a lot of stuff into this place. From the cracks in the ceiling, you can see part of the train tracks, and sometimes you can hear the train as it passes by.

[[Image:Roxasandcoattheclocktower.JPG|thumb|right|Pence, Hayner, Olette and Roxas sitting on top of the clock tower]]

In the middle of the shopping district, there is a large Tram Plaza. There are plenty of [[stores]] here, including an [[accessory]] shop, as well as lots of houses lined up. The tram that travels through the plaza is a very important vehicle, and the citizens use it often. Around the suburbs of the town is Sunset Residential District. This place overlooks the ocean. Streetlamps line a small river that passes through the middle of the district, and not too many people are seen walking around. This area has Sunset Station, where the train from Central Station takes you, and Sunset Hill, where you can seen the most beautiful sunset in town. The monument on top of the hill is a tribute to the building of the clock tower.

Within the world of Twilight Town is also the Tower, the residence of [[Yen Sid]] and Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. The Tower is located on something of an island in space, and is only reachable through a special train, colored blue with golden stars and adorned with a large wizard's hat. Yen Sid explains the [[Heartless]], Nobodies and [[Organization XIII]] in detail to Sora, Donald and Goofy here. Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, also create Sora's new outfit, granting him the power of [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)#Drive|Drive]]. [[Maleficent]] is revived here, and [[Black Pete|Pete]] is also met for the first time.

[[Image:Mansionkh2twilighttown.png|thumb|left|Sora and company in front of the mansion in Twilight Town]]

Roxas and Hayner later enter a mid-summer tournament at the Sandlot of Twilight Town called "the Struggle" in which he must face off against several others. The battles are one-on-one, and the basic premise is to pick up little orbs that the opponent drops. The popularity of the event is enormous. Other competitors taking part include [[Seifer Almasy]], who is with [[List of Final Fantasy VIII characters#Raijin|Raijin]] and [[List of Final Fantasy VIII characters#Fujin|Fujin]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', [[Setzer Gabbiani]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' and [[Vivi Orunitia]] from ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]''. Also lurking around at the time of the competition is Axel, who briefly fights with Roxas.

On the outskirts of the town is a mysterious large mansion. Going from the Tram Plaza, the player has to pass through a [[forest]] to get here. The gate is locked, and it seems impossible to enter or leave, but there are rumors of 2 shadows being seen in the second floor windows. [[DiZ]] transported [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]] who were in the process of restoring the memory lost before the events of Castle Oblivion to the [[basement]] of the mansion to speed up the process for his revenge against [[Organization XIII]]. It is revealed later in the game that the portal to the final world of the game, the World That Never Was, was actually hidden under the basement of this mansion in the Twllight Town simulation.

Twilight Town has plenty of jobs to offer Roxas, including mini-games that feature delivering letters on a [[skateboard]], in addition to placing posters.

==Beast's Castle==
[[Image:Sorabeastcastle.jpg|thumb|right|Sora, battling his way through Beast's Castle in Valor form]]
{{nihongo|'''Beast's Castle'''|ビーストキャッスル|Bīsuto Kyassuru}} is an ornate chateau based on the castle of Disney's thirtieth animated feature, ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. It is featured in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' as one of the first worlds visited on Sora's journey. Despite its large size, the castle is inhabited only by the [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#The Beast|Beast]] himself, along with his servants who have been turned into objects suited to their jobs and personalities by an enchantress' spell.

After the sealing of the door to Kingdom Hearts, Beast took [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Belle|Belle]] to the newly restored castle. The Entrance Hall of the castle leads to a parlor, the Ballroom and its two wings. The East Wing leads to a guest bedroom. The West Wing leads to the Beast's room, as well as the castle's dungeon area. A courtyard is located outside the castle which leads to a long bridge across the castle's moat.

[[Image:Beastcastle2.jpg|thumb|left|The enchanted inhabitants of Beast's Castle]]
Sora and company enter to castle to hear Beast's familiar roar. When they meet, Beast does not seem to recognize them and merely stalks off with his mystical rose in tow. They go to the East Wing to see Belle who reveals that Beast is acting strangely, locking his servants into the dungeons. Fighting their way through the throngs of Heartless which have appeared in the castle, Sora goes to the West Wing dungeon. He defeats a Thresholder Heartless guarding the door and frees the servants. They suggest a secret passage to reach the Beast's room to bring him back to his senses. It seems that a mysterious man in a black coat has been clouding Beast's mind with thoughts of rage. After a brief tussle, the Beast's fury calms and he rejoins Sora. Belle's screams alert danger in the Ballroom. A large chained Shadow Stalker Heartless possesses the room, making it a volatile hazard in their fight. Defeating it only breaks its chains and it morphs into the more powerful Dark Thorn Heartless. After its defeat, the castle is safe and the Beast and Belle reenter their uneasy relationship.

When Sora returns, they find Beast dressed up for a dance with Belle. Unfortunately, they are soon interrupted by [[Organization XIII#III. Xaldin|Xaldin]] of Organization XIII. After defeating his minions, they find that he has stolen the magical rose. Beast blames Belle because of her dance idea. He asks Sora and Belle to leave his castle to protect them from his uncontrollable rage. Sora manages to convince Beast of his inner strength and they join forces again to confront Xaldin. Xaldin, who has captured Belle in addition to the rose, asks Beast to choose which is more dear to him. In a daring act, Belle escapes Xaldin's grasp and takes the rose from him. Sora and Beast then fight and kill Xaldin. The Beast reconciles with Belle and their romance blossoms.

{{nihongo|'''The Land of Dragons'''|ザ・ランド・オブ・ドラゴン|Za Rando obu Doragon}} is an [[History of China|imperial kingdom]] featured in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and based on Disney's thirty-sixth animated feature, ''[[Mulan]]''. After a border skirmish heralds the impending invasion by the [[Huns]], the country rapidly prepares for war, conscripting young men from every family. Unfortunately, the dark heart of the leader of the Huns, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Shan-Yu|Shan-Yu]], has allowed him to take control of the Heartless and lead them in his invasion.

The Land of Dragons has an [[The Orient|oriental]] atmosphere, characterized by harmony with nature. The Bamboo Grove provides a serene environment which is only disturbed by the impending war. The Encampment is the center of military activity in the area. The Checkpoint leads to both the Imperial City and a mountain village. The summit of the snow-capped mountain is the entryway for invading armies.

Arriving at the Land of Dragons, Sora is reunited with [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Mushu|Mushu]] who moonlighted as Sora's ally in a previous adventure. Mushu is helping [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Mulan|Mulan]], a woman who disguised herself as a man to take her elderly father's place, to get into the army. As Sora and Mulan successfully complete mission after mission, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Captain Li Shang|Captain Shang]], begins to trust in Mulan's ability. Mushu thinks he sees Shan-Yu enter a cave in the mountains and wants Mulan to defeat him to prove herself. As they arrive, it turns out to be a trap; as Sora and Mulan battle the Heartless in the cave, Shan-Yu attacks and razes the village. In revenge, they go up the mountain to confront Shan-Yu. Mulan's well-placed rocket destroys most of Shan-Yu's Heartless army with an avalanche. Captain Shang finally acknowledges Mulan's skill but Mushu accidentally reveals Mulan's secret. She is expelled from the army in shame. Mulan discovers that Shan-Yu is not dead after witnessing his emergence from under the snow. They rush to the Imperial City but it is too late; Shan-Yu kidnaps the [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#The Emperor|Emperor]]. After a daring rescue, the team defeats the invader once and for all.

Sora returns to the Land of Dragons to find Mulan in pursuit of a man in a black hood. Sora confronts him and recognizes his weapon. While wondering if it really was Riku, a gigantic Heartless dragon flies from the mountains towards the Imperial City. They follow and encounter the black-hooded man who turns out to be [[Organization XIII#II. Xigbar|Xigbar]] of Organization XIII. More pressing matters arise as the Storm Rider Heartless attacks. Sora and his friends defeat the dragon and the Emperor personally rewards them. He grants Mulan's wish to be by Shang's side and also tells Sora of his encounter with a black-hooded man. Sora concludes that it must have been Riku and is satisfied in knowing that he is safe.

==Pride Lands==
<!---Pride Lands.--->
[[Image:Pridelands-simba.jpg|thumb|right|Simba, away from his home]]
{{nihongo|'''Pride Land'''|プライド・ランド|Puraido Rando}} is a [[savanna]] world based on Disney's thirty-second animated feature, ''[[The Lion King]]''. It was originally considered for inclusion in ''Kingdom Hearts'' but the game's engine could not correctly handle a quadripedal animal as the player, so it was moved to ''Kingdom Hearts II''. After the death of the previous king, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Mufasa|Mufasa]], his deceitful brother [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Scar|Scar]] took the throne. Since then, the Pride Land has seen a steady decline in living conditions, due to his poor rule. While in Pride Land, Sora is transformed into a lion cub, Donald becomes a [[hornbill]] bird and Goofy takes the body of a tortoise.

Pride Land is dominated by a large central [[savanna]]h area which branches off in three directions. To the north is Pride Rock, home of the lions and the seat of the world's political power. The area southwest of the savannah is where outcasts from Pride Rock, such as the hyenas, live. The skeletons of several large elephants earns this area its nickname, the Elephant Graveyard. Southeast of the savannah are the Wastelands, an arid desert of little life. Beyond the Wastelands, however, is a lush oasis.

Sora and his friends arrive in a desolate area of the Pride Land. Traveling here, they fight off a group of Heartless and save a lioness named [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Nala|Nala]]. She explains that under the rule of the new king, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Scar|Scar]], the quality of living has dropped drastically. After an unfortunate encounter with Scar and Pete, Sora is forced to flee Pride Rock with Nala. An idle comment by Nala leads to her revelation that [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Simba|Simba]], the son of the previous king, is still alive. Traveling to an oasis, Sora is reunited with his former comrade. When approached about the prospect of being the king of Pride Land, he is less than thrilled. That night, his father [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Mufasa|Mufasa]] appears to him in a vision and commands him to take his place in the Circle of Life. Emboldened, he joins Sora and returns to Pride Rock to confront Scar. He and Scar duel while Sora takes care of Scar's hyena lackeys. At the peak of Pride Rock, Simba deals a finishing blow but Scar's dark heart transforms him into a Heartless. After a gruesome battle, Simba and Sora emerge victorious and Simba ascends the throne.

When Sora and company return, all is not well. It seems that Simba is plagued with doubt and haunted by mysterious ghosts resembling Scar. Sora encourages Simba to follow his own path, rather than trying to be his father. [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Rafiki|Rafiki]], the king's advisor, gives Simba some ominous words and suggests he confront the hyenas at the Elephant Graveyard. After defeating them, Scar's ghost appears and Simba's resolve crumbles. Sora finds him at the oasis, disheartened. Through Sora's goading, Simba manages to defeat the ghost and regains his strength. Unfortunately, a large number of Scar ghosts coalesce into the powerful Groundshaker Heartless. Through the strength of their hearts, Simba and Sora defeat it, restoring peace to the Pride Land.

==Port Royal==

{{nihongo|'''Port Royal'''|ポートロイヤル|Pōto Roiyaru}} is a port with surrounding waters, based on Disney's [[live action]] film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', and featured in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. A local legend tells of a fearsome pirate ship called the Black Pearl with a crew of undead pirates led by [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Captain Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]]. Another legend is of a grand [[Aztec]] treasure hoard of eight-hundred and eighty-two pieces which curses those who disturb it with eternal un-life.

Port Royal, named after the [[Port Royal|eponymous town]] in real life, is a well-defended port city in a mysterious sea called the [[Caribbean]]. The town is mostly deserted because of the appearance of the Heartless but the ramparts are still well-equipped to fight off any pirate threats. The mystical island of Aztec treasure, [[Isla de Muerta]], cannot be found except by those who already know its location. The Ship Graveyard is the last major feature of the sea. The waters around this area are especially treacherous, rightfully earning its name.

Sora arrives in Port Royal feeling strange. They see Captain Barbossa conspiring with Pete who warns him of Sora's magic. They discover that the undead pirates can only be defeated under moonlight. Heading into town in pursuit, they find [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth Swann]] being captured while [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Will Turner|Will Turner]] watches, unable to defeat the Heartless. Will appeals to [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#Captain Jack Sparrow|Jack Sparrow]], former captain of the Black Pearl, to help give chase. Jack reluctantly agrees while Sora tries to hide his excitement at the chance to be a pirate. Aboard the Interceptor ship, they go to Isla de Muerta. It turns out that Elizabeth's Aztec medallion is not enough to break the pirates' curse; Will Turner's blood is also necessary. The Pearl overtakes [[The Interceptor]] to capture Will but he threatens [[suicide]]. Barbossa agrees to negotiate but he swindles Will. Sora and the others are trapped on the Interceptor, rigged with explosives, but Jack manages to escape and save the ship. They return to Isla de Muerta to confront Barbossa. With an Illuminator Heartless summoned by Pete, he is nearly invincible. After a difficult battle, Jack shoots Barbossa. Laughing, he turns in time to see Will break the curse with his blood. Barbossa dies and Jack regains the Pearl. Will and Elizabeth return to Port Royal.

Sora revisits Port Royal to see the undead pirates return. Will had gone to Isla de Muerta to investigate but has not yet returned. Elizabeth orders Jack to set sail. They find Will, unconscious, drifting on the Interceptor. He explains that a man in a black coat has disturbed the Aztec treasure. Soon, [[Organization XIII#X. Luxord|Luxord]] appears and summons a Grim Reaper Heartless. After defeating it, Luxord reappears with the cursed treasure chest. He throws four medallions to some Gambler Nobodies, cursing the Grim Reaper Heartless. It then knocks Sora and the others to the Interceptor while Luxord uses the Pearl's cannons to destroy it. They find themselves in the Ship Graveyard, where they defeat a Gambler Nobody and recover a medallion. Will and Elizabeth arrive to rescue them and they recover the other medallions from the Nobodies. Returning to Port Royal, they find the cursed Grim Reaper Heartless and the treasure chest. They restore the medallions, making the Grim Reaper vulnerable again. They defeat it and sink the treasure chest to the bottom of the sea. Luxord smiles as the defeated Heartless releases its captive heart and sends it to Kingdom Hearts before disappearing. Despite this, Port Royal enjoys peace at last.

== The World That Never Was ==
[[Image:Theworldthatneverwaslogo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The world logo for The World That Never Was]]

{{nihongo|'''The World That Never Was'''|存在しなかった世界|Sonzaishinakatta Sekai}} is home to Organization XIII, and is situated in the Realm of Darkness.

The World That Never Was was originally featured in a secret ending video known as "Another side, Another story..." and "Another Side, Another Story [deep dive]". It is the final world of ''Kingdom Hearts II''. Here, [[Organization XIII#XIII. Roxas|Roxas]] and [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]] co-op fend off Neoshadow [[Heartless]] and eventually fight each other because Riku questions why Roxas has the Keyblade.

The most distinct feature of this world is that is appears to be in a state of eternal night and a large moon shaped like a heart, Kingdom Hearts, continually shines in the sky. It also houses the headquarters to [[Organization XIII]], the Castle That Never Was, which is portrayed as a huge white castle decorated with the emblem of the Nobodies.

Pluto appears briefly in the World That Never Was and tries to follow Axel through a dark portal when Axel captures Kairi, but the portal vanishes before Pluto can enter. However, another dark portal appears behind him, and he goes through that one. How Pluto even entered the World That Never Was was at the time unknown.

Sora, Donald, Goofy and King Mickey arrive here with the help of Axel to encounter a member of the Organization (Roxas). While Sora's group heads to the fortress, Naminé helps Kairi to escape her prison and make a break for it. Though they are stopped by Saïx, a hooded man in an Organization coat saves them and Saïx escapes. Naminé identifies him as Riku and Kairi is overjoyed to see her dear friend again. She takes off his hood, only to reveal Xehanort's Heartless' face underneath. Kairi knows that Riku is only in Xehanort's Heartless' form as a change from the power of darkness and takes it in stride.

[[Image:Theworldthatneverwaskh2.jpg|thumb|right|The World That Never Was in ''Kingdom Hearts II'']]Sora's team enters the castle with King Mickey going on ahead to try and stop Xemnas. He encounters DiZ being ambushed by Nobodies and saves him as well as a machine that he was protecting. DiZ unmasks himself to reveal himself as Ansem the Wise, leader of the Radiant Garden, who plans to use his machine to digitally seal away Kingdom Hearts before Xemnas can enter it. The two leaders go off to set up the machine. 

By this time, Sora, Donald and Goofy have defeated Xigbar, reunited with Riku and Kairi, and fight Luxord and Saïx on their way through the castle to reach King Mickey and Ansem. Eventually, they reach the two leaders. DiZ's machine can't handle the digitization of something as large and unpredictable as Kingdom Hearts and begins to overload. Asking Riku to finish off Xemnas for him and asking King Mickey to forgive him for being so foolish, DiZ is killed when his machine finally reaches the breaking point and explodes. The explosion blows away Riku's Xehanort's Heartless form and reveals the true Riku underneath. The remaining party members; Sora, Donald, Goofy, Kairi, Riku and King Mickey, head off to go after Xemnas.

As the world begins to collapse prior to Xemnas' first defeat after absorbing Kingdom Hearts' power, Riku and Sora are left behind to face off against a gigantic dragon creature controled by Xemnas and then the all-powerful version of Xemnas himself. Sora and Riku eventually defeat him and are warped to a lonesome beach as Kairi's letter (which she sent off earlier in the game) reaches them and the door to light opens to send Sora and Riku back home to the Destiny Islands.

The World That Never Was is only playable in ''Kingdom Hearts II''.
