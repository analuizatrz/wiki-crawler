[[Image:Turk-engraving5.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An engraving of the Turk from [[Karl Gottlieb von Windisch]]'s 1784 book ''Briefe über den Schachspieler von Kempelen nebst drey Kupferstichen die diese berühmte Maschine vorstellen.'']]
'''The Turk''' is a famous [[hoax]] which purported to be a [[chess]]-playing [[machine]].  Constructed and unveiled in [[1770]] by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[baron]] [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]] (1734-1804), the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of [[chess]] against a human opponent, as well as perform the [[knight's tour]], a puzzle which requires the player to move a knight to occupy every square of a chess board once and only once. 

Called an [[automaton]], the Turk was actually a mechanical [[optical illusions|illusion]] that allowed a [[human]] chess master of any size to hide inside and operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games it played.  The apparatus toured [[Europe]] and the [[United States|United States of America]] for over 80 years until its destruction in 1854, playing and defeating many challengers including world leaders such as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

==Construction==
[[Image:kempelen-charcoal.jpg|right|thumb|A signed [[charcoal]] [[self-portrait]] of Kempelen, who constructed the Turk.]]
Kempelen was inspired to build the Turk following his attendance at the court of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] at [[Schönbrunn Palace]], where [[François Pelletier]] was performing an illusion act.  An exchange following the performance resulted in Kempelen promising to return to the Palace with an invention that would top the performance.<ref name=Anomalies>[[Ricky Jay]], "The Automaton Chess Player, the Invisible Girl, and the Telephone," ''[[Jay's Journal of Anomalies]]'', vol.&nbsp;4 no.&nbsp;4, 2000.</ref>

[[Image:Turk-engraving6.jpg|left|thumb|A copper engraving of the Turk, showing the open cabinets and working parts.]]The result of the challenge was the Automaton-Chess Player,<ref name=Poe>[[Edgar Allan Poe]], "Maelzel's Chess-Player," ''Southern Literary Journal'', April 1836; available on the internet via the [http://www.eapoe.org/works/essays/maelzel.htm Edgar Allen Poe Society] of Baltimore, Maryland, URL accessed [[19 December]] 2006.</ref> known in modern times as the Turk. The machine consisted of a human-sized model with a black beard and grey eyes<ref name=MindingTheMachine>Stephen Patrick Rice, ''Minding the Machine: Languages of Class in Early Industrial America''.  (London: University of California Press, 2004; ISBN 0520227816).</ref> dressed in [[Turkey|Turkish]] robes and a [[turban]], "the traditional costume," according to journalist and author [[Tom Standage]], "of an [[oriental]] [[sorcerer]]."  Its left arm held a [[smoking pipe|long Turkish smoking pipe]] while at rest, its right lay on the top of a large cabinet<ref name=StandageBook>Tom Standage, ''The Turk: The Life and Times of the Famous Eighteenth-Century Chess-Playing Machine'' (New York: Walker, 2002; ISBN 0802713912).</ref> which measured about 3.5 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] long, 2 feet wide, and 2.5 feet high.  Placed on the top of the cabinet was a chess board, which measured 1.5 feet square.<ref name=Anomalies/>  The front of the cabinet consisted of three doors, an [[aperture]] and a drawer which could be opened to reveal a red and white [[ivory]] chess set.<ref name=StandageBook/>

[[Image:Turk-engraving-figure.jpg|right|thumb|A sketch of the inner profile of the model.  The various parts were controlled by a human operator via interior levers and machinery.]]The interior of the machine was very complicated.  When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork.  The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open at the same time a person could see through the machine.  The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures.  This area was also designed to expose a clear line of vision through the machine.  Underneath the robes of the Turkish model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similar ability to see through the machine.  The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public to maintain the illusion.<ref name=StandageBook/>

The design of the Turk was crafted to mislead those who observed it.<ref name=Anomalies/>  The clockwork visible to the left side of the machine, as well as the drawer which housed the chess set, did not extend fully to the rear of the cabinet but only one third of the way.  A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place as the presenter opened various doors.  The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further disguise the person inside the cabinet.<ref name=StandageBook/>

The chess board on the top of the cabinet was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board.  This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board.<ref name=StandageBook/>  The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1-64,  allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move.<ref name=AH>Ernest Wittenberg, "[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1960/2/1960_2_34.shtml Échec!]," ''American Heritage Magazine'', 1968.  URL accessed [[1 January]] 2007.</ref>  The magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnets did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.<ref name=IatI>Thomas Leroy Hankins, Robert J. Silverman, ''Instruments and the Imagination'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995).</ref>  

As a further means of misdirection, the Turk came with a small wooden coffin-like box that the presenter would place on the top of the cabinet.<ref name=Anomalies/>  While [[Johann Nepomuk Mälzel]], a later owner of the machine, did not use the box,<ref name=Levitt>Gerald M. Levitt, ''The Turk, Chess Automaton'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2000).</ref> Kempelen often peered into the box during play, suggesting that the box controlled some aspect of the machine.<ref name=Anomalies/>  The box was believed by some to have supernatural power, with [[Karl Gottlieb von Windisch]] writing in his 1784 book ''Briefe über den Schachspieler von Kempelen nebst drey Kupferstichen die diese berühmte Maschine vorstellen'' (translated as ''Inanimate Reason; or, A Circumstantial Account of that Astonishing Piece of Mechanism, M. de Kempelen's Chess-Player, Now Exhibiting at No. 9 Savile-Row, Burlington Gardens'')<ref name=Levitt/> that "[o]ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten the tales she had been told in her youth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. went and hid herself in a window seat, as distant as she could from the ''evil spirit,'' which she firmly believed possessed the machine."<ref name=Windisch>Karl Gottlieb von Windisch, ''Briefe über den Schachspieler von Kempelen nebst drey Kupferstichen die diese berühmte Maschine vorstellen'' (London, 1784); quoted in Levitt's ''The Turk, Chess Automaton.''</ref>

[[Image:Turk-engraving1.jpg|left|thumb|A cross-section of the Turk showing how the director would sit inside as he played his opponent.]]The interior also contained a [[Perforated hardboard|pegboard]] chess board connected to a [[pantograph]]-style series of levers which controlled the model's left arm.  The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chess board, and would move the arm of the Turk over the chess board on the cabinet simultaneously.  The range of motion allowed the director to move the Turk's arm up and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk's hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board.  Another part of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion<ref name=StandageBook/><ref name=IatI/> and other parts allowed the Turk to make various facial expressions.<ref name=MachineIntuition>George Atkinson, ''Chess and Machine Intuition'' (Exeter: Intellect, 1998; ISBN 1871516447).</ref> A voice box was added following the Turk's acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say "Échec!" ([[French (language)|French]] for "[[Check_%28board_game%29|check]]") during matches.<ref name=Poe/>

An operator inside the machine also had tools to assist in communicating with the presenter outside.  Two brass discs equipped with numbers were positioned opposite each other on the inside and outside of the cabinet.  A rod could rotate the discs to the desired number, which acted as a code between the two.<ref name=StandageBook/>

==Exhibition==

The Turk made its debut in 1770 at Schönbrunn Palace, about six months after Pelletier's act.  Kempelen addressed the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts.  With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet, allowing members of the audience to inspect the machine.  Following the display, Kempelen would announce that the machine was ready for a challenger.<ref name=StandageBook/>

Kempelen would inform the player that the Turk would use the white pieces and have the first move.  Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion.  The Turk could nod twice if it threatened its opponent's queen, and nod three times upon placing the king in check.  If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent's move.<ref name=StandageBook/>  [[Louis Dutens]], a traveler in Europe who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine "by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her."<ref name=Dutens>Louis Dutens, from a letter published in ''Le Mercure du France'' ([[Paris]], circa October 1770; later translated into English and reprinted in ''Gentleman's Magazine'' (London); quoted in Levitt's ''The Turk, Chess Automaton.''</ref>  Kempelen made it a point to traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and lodestones to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights.  The first person to play the Turk was [[Count Ludwig von Cobenzl]], an Austrian [[courtier]] at the palace.  He, along with other challengers that day, was quickly defeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played aggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.<ref name=StandageBook/>[[Image:Turk-knights-tour.svg|left|thumb|The [[knight's tour]], as solved by the Turk.  This solution shows that a closed loop is formed, allowing the tour to be completed from any starting point on the board.<ref name=StandageBook/>]]

Another part of the machine's exhibition was the completion of the [[knight's tour]], a famed chess puzzle.  The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chess board, touching each square once along the way.  While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with the unique mapping of the puzzle laid out.<ref name=StandageBook/>

The Turk also had the ability to converse with spectators using a letter board.  The director, whose identity during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown,<ref name=StandageBook/> was able to converse in [[English (language)|English]], [[French (language)|French]], and [[German (language)|German]].  [[Carl Friedrich Hindenburg]], a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in [[Leipzig]] and published it as ''Ueber den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen, nebst einer Abbildung und Beschreibung seiner Sprachmachine'' (or ''About the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen and an Imitation of It'') in 1789.  Questions asked and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and questions about the machine's secrets.<ref name=Levitt/>

==The tour of Europe==

Following word of its debut, interest in the machine grew across Europe.  However, Kempelen was more interested in his other projects and avoided exhibiting the Turk, often lying to prospective challengers about the machine's repair status.  Von Windisch wrote at one point that Kempelen "refused the entreaties of his friends, and a crowd of curious persons from all countries, the satisfaction of seeing this far-famed machine."<ref name=StandageBook/>  In the decade following its debut at the Palace the Turk only played one opponent, [[Sir Robert Murray Keith]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] noble, and Kempelen went as far as dismantling the Turk entirely following the match.<ref name=StandageBook/>  Kempelen was quoted as referring to the invention as a "mere [[bagatelle]]," as he was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue work on [[steam engine]]s and attempts to create machines that replicated human speech.<ref name=Anomalies/>

In 1781, Kempelen was ordered by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] to reconstruct the Turk and deliver it to [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia and his wife.  The appearance was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of [[Europe]] for the Turk, a request Kempelen reluctantly agreed to.<ref name=StandageBook/>

[[Image:André Philidor.jpg|right|frame|François-André Danican Philidor played a match against the Turk in Paris in 1793.]]The Turk began its European tour in 1783, beginning with an appearance in [[France]] in April. A stop at [[Versailles]] preceded an exhibition in [[Paris, France|Paris]], where the Turk lost a match to [[Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne]], the [[La_Tour_d%27Auvergne#Later_history:_Dukes_of_Bouillon_and_Albret|Duc de Bouillon]].  Upon arrival in Paris in May of 1793 it was displayed to the public and played a variety of opponents, including a lawyer named Mr. Bernard who was a second [[Chess#Titles_and_rankings|rank]] in chess ability.<ref name=StandageBook/>  Following the sessions at Versailles, demands increased for a match with [[François-André Danican Philidor]], who was considered the best chess player of his time.<ref name=Levitt/>  Moving to the [[Café de la Régence]], the machine played many of the most skilled players, often losing, until securing a match with Philidor at the [[Académie des Sciences]].  While Philidor won his match with the Turk, Philidor's son noted that his father called it "his most fatiguing game of chess ever!"<ref name=Levitt/>  The Turk's final game in Paris was against [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was serving as ambassador to France from the United States.  Franklin reportedly enjoyed the game with the Turk and was interested in the machine for the rest of his life, keeping a copy of [[Philip Thicknesse]]'s book ''The Speaking Figure and the Automaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected'' in his personal library.<ref name=Levitt/>

Following his tour of Paris, Kempelen moved the Turk to London, where it was exhibited daily for five [[shillings]].  Thicknesse, known in his time as a noted [[skeptic]], sought out the Turk in an attempt to expose the inner workings of the machine.<ref name=Levitt/>  While he respected Kempelen as "a very ingenious man",<ref name=Anomalies/> he asserted that the Turk was an elaborate hoax with a small child inside the machine, describing the machine as "a complicated piece of clockwork .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which is nothing more, than one, of many other ingenious devices, to misguide and delude the observers."<ref name=Thicknesse>Philip Thicknesse, ''The Speaking Figure and the Automaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected'' (London, 1794), quoted in Levitt's ''The Turk, Chess Automaton.''</ref>  

After a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk traveled to Leipzig, stopping in various European cities along the way.  From Leipzig, it went to [[Dresden]], where [[Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz]] viewed the Turk and published his findings in ''Ueber den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen, nebst einer Abbildung und Beschreibung seiner Sprachmachine,'' along with illustrations showing his beliefs about how the machine operated. It then moved to [[Amsterdam]], accepting an invitation to the palace of [[Frederick the Great]], [[King of Prussia]] at [[Sanssouci]] in [[Potsdam, Germany|Potsdam]].  Frederick enjoyed the Turk so much that he paid a large sum of money to Kempelen in exchange for the Turk's secrets.  While Frederick never gave the secret away, he was reportedly disappointed to learn how the machine worked.<ref name=Levitt/>

The Turk's final stop was back where the machine began, at Schönbrunn Palace.  The machine stayed dormant for over two decades, although Kempelen attempted unsuccessfully to sell it in his final years. Kempelen died at age 70 on [[26 March]], 1804.<ref name=Levitt/>

==Mälzel and the machine==

Following the death of Kempelen, the Turk remained unexhibited until some time before 1808 when Kempelen's son decided to sell it to [[Johann Nepomuk Mälzel]], a [[Bavaria]]n musician with an interest in various machines and devices.  Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of [[metronome]], had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Wolfgang von Kempelen's death.  The original attempt had failed owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 [[franc]]s; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.<ref name=Levitt/>

Upon acquiring the Turk, Mälzel had to learn its secrets and make some repairs to get it back in working order. His stated goal was to make explaining the Turk a greater challenge.  While the completion of this goal took ten years, the Turk still made appearances, most notably with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]].<ref name=Levitt/>

In 1809, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] arrived at Schönbrunn Palace to play the Turk.  According to an eyewitness report, Mälzel took responsibility for the construction of the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk saluted Bonaparte prior to the start of the match.  The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory.<ref name=StandageBook/>  According to [[Bradley Ewart]], it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Bonaparte sat at a separate chess table.  Bonaparte's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area.  Mälzel crossed back and forth to make each player's move, allowing a clear view for the spectators.  In a surprise move, Bonaparte took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue.  Shortly thereafter, Bonaparte attempted an illegal move.  Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game.  Bonaparte attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn.  Bonaparte then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board.  Bonaparte was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before [[checkmate|tipping over his king in surrender]].<ref name=Ewart>Bradley Ewart, ''Chess: Man vs. Machine,'' (London, 1980).</ref>  Alternate versions of the story include Bonaparte being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a [[shawl]] around the head and body of the Turk to obscure its vision.<ref name=Levitt/>

In 1811, Mälzel brought the Turk to [[Milan]] for a performance with [[Eugène de Beauharnais]], the Prince de Venise.  Beauharnais enjoyed the machine so much that he offered to purchase it from Mälzel.  After some serious bargaining, Beauharnais acquired the Turk for 30,000 francs, three times what Mälzel had paid, and kept it for four years.  In 1815, Mälzel returned to Beauharnais and asked to buy the Turk back, eventually working out an agreement where Mälzel would pay Beauharnais 30,000 francs out of profits of future exhibitions in Europe while not taking the Turk off the continent.<ref name=Levitt/>

[[Image:Malzels-exhibition-ad.JPG|right|thumb|An advertisement for Mälzel's appearance with the Turk in London.<ref name=Levitt/>]]Following the repurchase, Mälzel brought the Turk back to Paris where he made acquaintances of many of the leading chess players at Café de la Régence. Mälzel stayed in France with the machine until 1818, when he moved to London and held a number of performances with the Turk and many of his other machines. In London, Mälzel and his act received a large amount of press and he continued improving the machine,<ref name=Levitt/> ultimately installing a voice box so the machine could say "Échec!" when placing a player in check.<ref name=StandageBook/>

In 1819, Mälzel brought the Turk on a tour of the entire [[United Kingdom]].  There were several new developments in the act, such as allowing the opponent the first move and eliminating the king's bishop's pawn from the Turk's pieces.  This [[Chess_handicap#Other_forms_of_handicap|pawn handicap]] created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by [[W. J. Hunneman]] chronicling the matches played with this handicap.<ref>''Chess.  A Selection of Fifty Games, from Those Played by the Automaton Chess-Player, During Its Exhibition in London, in 1820.''</ref>  With the handicap, the Turk ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two [[stalemate]]s.<ref name=Levitt/>

==Mälzel in America==

Although the appearances of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, he fell into debt and was eventually sued by Beauharnais for failure to honour their agreement.  Mälzel was unable to sell the Turk to pay off the debts, and instead chose to take it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826 he opened an exhibition in [[New York City]] which slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret.  Mälzel's problems was finding a proper director for the machine,<ref name=Levitt/> having trained a nameless woman in France before coming to the United States.  He ended up recalling a former director, [[William Schlumberger]], from Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.<ref name=AH/>  Before his arrival, Mälzel was forced to limit the exhibition of the machine to [[endgame]]s due to the lack of skill of his director, much to the chagrin of the public.<ref name=Levitt/>

Upon Schlumberger's arrival, the Turk debuted in [[Boston]], Mälzel [[Spin (public relations)|spinning]] the story that the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the Boston players were much better opponents.  This was a success for some weeks, and the tour moved to [[Philadelphia]] for three months.  Following Philadelphia, the Turk moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where it played for a number of months, including losing a match against [[Charles Carroll]], a signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]].  The exhibition in Baltimore brought news that two brothers constructed their own machine, the [[Walker Chess-player]].  Mälzel viewed the competing machine and attempted to buy it, but the offer was declined and the duplicate machine toured for a number of years, never receiving the fame that Mälzel's machine did and eventually falling into obscurity.<ref name=Levitt/>

Mälzel continued with exhibitions around the United States until 1828, when he took some time off and visited Europe, returning in 1829.  Throughout the 1830s, he continued to tour the United States, moving as far west as the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and visiting [[Canada]].  In [[Richmond, Virginia]], the Turk was observed by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who was writing for the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]].''  Poe's essay "[[Maelzel's Chess Player]]" was published in April 1836 and is the most famous essay on the Turk, even though many of Poe's hypotheses are incorrect.<ref name=Levitt/>

Mälzel eventually brought the Turk to [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]]. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of [[yellow fever]], leaving Mälzel without a director for his machine.  Dejected, he took the Turk back to Philadelphia and later made a second visit to Havana.  Mälzel would die at sea in 1838 at age 66 during his return trip, leaving his machinery with the ship captain.<ref name=Levitt/>

==The final years and beyond==

Upon the return of the ship that Mälzel died on, Mälzel's various machines, including the Turk, fell into the hands of a friend of Mälzel's, the businessman [[John Ohl]].  He attempted to auction off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought it himself for $400.<ref name=Levitt/>  Only when Dr. [[John Kearsley Mitchell]] from Philadelphia, Edgar Allen Poe's personal [[physician]] and an admirer of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk change hands again.<ref name=Anomalies/>  Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.<ref name=Levitt/>

As interest in the Turk outgrew its location, Mitchell and his club chose to donate the machine to the [[Peale Museum|Chinese Museum]] of [[Charles Willson Peale]].  While the Turk still occasionally gave performances, it was eventually relegated to the corners of the museum and forgotten about until [[5 July]], 1854, when a fire that started at the [[National Theater]] in Philadelphia reached the Museum and destroyed the Turk.<ref name=Levitt/>  Mitchell believed he had heard "through the struggling flames .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the last words of our departed friend, the sternly whispered, oft repeated syllables, 'echec! echec!!<!--The double exclamation points are direct from the text, please do not adjust -bdj -->'"<ref name=Mitchell>Silas Weir Mitchell, "The Last of a Veteran Chess Player," ''The Chess Monthly,'' January 1857; quoted in Levitt's ''The Turk, Chess Automaton.''</ref>

[[Image:TurkSColes.jpg|left|thumb|150px|John Gaughan's reconstructed Turk.]][[John Gaughan]], a manufacturer of equipment for magicians based in [[Los Angeles, California]], spent $120,000 building his own version of Kempelen's machine over a 5 year period beginning in 1984.<ref name=Levitt/> The machine uses new parts with the exception of the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire.  The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November of 1989 at a history of magic conference.  The machine is presented in a similar way to how Kempelen presented it, except that it is now controlled by a computer.<ref name=StandageBook/>

==Revealing the secrets==

While many books and articles were written during the Turk's life about how it worked, most were inaccurate, drawing wrong inferences from external observation.  It was not until Dr. Silas Mitchell's series of articles for ''[[The Chess Monthly]]'' that the secret was fully revealed.  Dr. Silas Mitchell, son of the final owner of the Turk, Dr. John Kearsley Mitchell,<ref name=Levitt/> wrote that "no secret was ever kept as the Turk's has been.  Guessed at, in part, many times, no one of the several explanations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ever solved this amusing puzzle."  As the Turk was lost to fire at the time of this publication, Dr. Silas Mitchell felt that "[t]here [were] no longer any reasons for concealing from the amateurs of chess, the solution to this ancient enigma."<ref name=Mitchell/>

In 1859, a letter published in the ''[[Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch]]'' by [[William F. Kummer]], who worked as a director under Dr. John Mitchell, revealed another piece of the secret: a lamp inside the cabinet. A series of tubes that led from the lamp to the turban of the Turk for ventilation.  The smoke rising from the turban would be disguised by the smoke coming from the other candelabra in the area where the game was played.<ref name=Levitt/>

Later in 1859, an uncredited article appeared in ''[[Littell's Living Age]].''  Purporting to be the story of the Turk from French magician [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], it was rife with errors ranging from dates of events to a story of a [[Poland|Polish]] officer whose legs were amputated, but ended up being rescued by Kempelin and smuggled back to [[Russia]] inside the machine.<ref name=Levitt/>

A new article about the Turk would not turn up until 1899, when ''[[The American Chess Magazine]]'' published an account of the Turk's match with Napoleon Bonaparte.  The story was basically a review of previous accounts, and a substantive published account would not appear until 1947, when ''[[Chess Review]]'' published articles by Kenneth Harkness and Jack Staley Battel that amounted to a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new diagrams that synthesized information from previous publications.  Another article written in 1960 for ''[[American Heritage]]'' by [[Ernest Wittenberg]] provided new diagrams describing how the director sat inside the cabinet.<ref name=Levitt/>

1949 brought the publication of [[Henry A. Davidson]]'s ''A Short History of Chess'', which talks of the Turk, giving significant weight to Poe's essay, which erroneously suggested that the player sat inside the Turk figure as opposed to the moving seat on the inside of the cabinet.  A similar error would occur in [[Alex G. Bell]]'s 1978 book, ''The Machine Plays Chess,'' which falsely asserted that "the operator was a trained boy (or very small adult) who followed the directions of the chess player who was hidden elsewhere on stage or in the theater.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."<ref name=Levitt/>  

More books were published about the Turk toward the end of the twentieth century.  Along with Bell's book, [[Charles Michael Carroll]]'s ''The Great Chess Automaton'' (1975) focused more on the studies of the Turk.  Bradley Ewart's ''Chess: Man vs. Machine'' (1980) discussed the Turk as well as other purported chess-playing automatons.<ref name=Levitt/>

It was not until the creation of [[Deep Blue]], [[IBM]]'s attempt at a computer that could challenge the world's best players,<ref name=BDB>[[Feng-hsiung Hsu]], ''Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion'' (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2002).</ref> that interest increased again, and two more books were published: [[Gerald M. Levitt]]'s ''The Turk, Chess Automaton'' (2000),<ref name=McFarland>McFarland, ''[http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?isbn=0-7864-2903-8 The Turk, Chess Automaton]'' product listing.

==Future inspiration==

[[Image:Ajeeb.jpg|right|thumb|An advertisement for an exhibition of Ajeeb, including an illustration of its appearance.

The Turk was visited in London by Rev. [[Edmund Cartwright]] in 1874.  He was was so intrigued by the Turk that he would later question whether "it is more difficult to construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make all the variety of moves required in that complicated game."  Cartwright would patent the [[prototype]] for a [[power loom]] within one year.<ref name=Levitt/>

[[Charles Wheatstone|Sir Charles Wheatstone]], an [[inventor]], saw a later appearance of the Turk while it was under the ownership of Mälzel. He also saw some of Mälzel's speaking machines and Mälzel later presented a demonstration of speaking machines to a researcher and his teenage son.  Wheatstone lent a book by Kempelen about the speaking machines to the son, [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; Bell would go on to invent the [[telephone]].<ref name=Anomalies/>

[[El Ajedrecista]] was built as a chess-playing automaton for the [[World's Fair]] in Paris in 1914.  Capable of playing endgames using electromagnets, it was the first true chess-playing automaton, and a precursor of sorts to Deep Blue.<ref name=ChessBaseAjeeb/>

In 2005, [[Amazon.com]] launched the [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]].  The [[world wide web|web-based]] [[software application]] coordinates [[programming]] tasks with [[human intelligence]], inspired in part by the way Kempelen's Turk operated.<ref name=AMT>Amazon.com: "[http://www.mturk.com/mturk/help?helpPage=whatis FAQ: What is Amazon Mechanical Turk?]  URL accessed 15 January 2006.</ref>  The program, still in [[beta]], is designed to have humans perform tasks, such as color comparisons, that computers struggle with.<ref name=Salon>Katharine Mieszkowski, "'I make $1.45 a week and I love it,'" [[Salon.com]], [[24 July]] 2006.
