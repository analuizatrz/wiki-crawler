'''Marc Lépine''' ([[October 26]], [[1964]] &ndash; [[December 6]], [[1989]]), born '''Gamil Gharbi''', was a 25-year-old man from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] who murdered fourteen women and wounded ten women and four men <!-- Most websources including media reports say 13 wounded, but a careful check of the coroner's report indicates several times that there were 14 wounded.

==Biography==
===Childhood and upbringing===
Lépine was born '''Gamil Rodrigue Gharbi''', the son of [[Algerian]] immigrant Rachid Liass Gharbi and [[Canadian]] Monique Lépine, in [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]] and was baptized a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] as an infant.<ref name="Chun">

He spent much of his early childhood in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Puerto Rico]], where his father was working as a successful mutual fund salesman. The family moved back to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock market crash led to the loss of much of the family's assets.<ref name="Citizen"/> Gamil's father had contempt for women and believed that they were only intended to serve men.<ref name="thousand">

When Gamil was seven, his parents separated and were subsequently divorced in 1976.<ref name="malarek"/> He lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia, seeing little of their father, of whom they were afraid. Rachid Gharbi subsequently ceased contact with his children and moved abroad.<ref name="Citizen"/><ref name="thousand"/>

In 1973, Monique Lépine returned to work as a nurse, and began further courses to advance her career. During this time the children lived with family and friends, seeing their mother at the weekends.<ref name="Citizen"/> The family spent a year in family psychotherapy in 1975 because of difficulties expressing and receiving love and affection.<ref name="thousand"/><ref name="Citizen"/>

===Adolescence===
In 1976, Monique Lépine became director of nursing at a Montreal hospital, and the family bought and moved to a house in the middle-class Montreal suburb of [[Pierrefonds, Quebec|Pierrefonds]]. Gamil attended junior high and high school where he was described as a quiet student who obtained middle to above average marks. He developed a close friendship with another boy, but did not mix much with other students.<ref name="Citizen2">

Gamil spent some summers as a youth learning to hunt with his uncles,<ref name="thousand"/> and also enjoyed designing and building electronic gadgets. He took considerable responsibility at home, including doing cleaning and repairs while his mother worked. During this time he began to insist on being called Marc Lépine, giving his hatred of his father as the reason for wishing to take his mother's name.<ref name="Citizen2"/>

He applied to join the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1981 at the age of 17, but was rejected during the interview process. He reported in his suicide letter that it was because he was "anti-social".<ref name="malarek">

An official statement from the military after the massacre stated that he had been "interviewed, assessed and determined to be unsuitable".<ref name="Citizen2"/>

===Adulthood===
Gharbi legally changed his name to Marc Lépine in 1982 at the age of 18,<ref name="malarek"/> and the family moved to [[Saint-Laurent (borough)|Saint-Laurent]], closer to his mother's work and to his new [[CEGEP]] (college). He quickly lost touch with his schoolfriend after the move.<ref name="Citizen2"/> This period marks the beginning of the seven years which he described in his suicide note as having "brought [him] no joy".

Lépine began a two year pre-university course in pure sciences at CEGEP Saint-Laurent, failing some courses in the first semester but improving his grades considerably in the second.<ref name="Citizen2"/> After a year he switched from the university-destined science program into electronics technology, a three-year technical program geared more towards immediate employment. His teachers remembered him as being a model student, quiet, hardworking and generally doing well in his classes, particularly those related to electrotechnology. However, in February 1986, during the last term of the program, he suddenly and without explanation stopped attending his classes, as a result failing to complete his [[Diploma of Collegial Studies|CEGEP diploma]].<ref name="McDonnell"/><ref name="Citizen2"/><ref name="CEGEP">

Lépine took a job in the kitchens at the hospital where his mother was director of nursing. He was seen as nervous and [[hyperactive]] by his colleagues.<ref name="CEGEP"/> He moved out of his mother's home into his own apartment<ref name="Citizen2"/> and in the fall of 1986, he applied to study engineering at the École Polytechnique at the Université de Montréal. He was admitted on the condition that he complete two compulsory courses, including one in solution chemistry.<ref name="coroner"/>

In the fall of 1987 he left his job at the hospital and took three courses at CEGEP obtaining good marks in all his courses.<ref name="Citizen2"/> In March 1988 he began a course in computer programming at a private college in downtown Montreal, funding his studies with government student loans.<ref name="McDonnell"/> Two months later he moved downtown to an apartment near his place of study and his mother's new condominium.<ref name="Citizen2"/>

In the winter of 1989 Lépine took a CEGEP night-course in solution chemistry, a prerequisite course for the École Polytechnique.<ref name="coroner"/> In March 1989 he abandoned the course in computer programming,<ref name="Citizen2"/> but did well in the CEGEP course, obtaining 100% in his final exam.<ref name="CEGEP"/>

==Massacre==
{{main|École Polytechnique massacre}}
In August 1989, Lépine picked up an application for a firearms-acquisition certificate and received his permit in mid-October.<ref name="Citizen2"/>
On [[November 21]], [[1989]], Lépine purchased a [[Ruger Mini-14]] [[semi-automatic rifle]] at a local sporting goods store.<ref>

During the period October to December 1989, Lépine was seen at least seven times at the École Polytechnique.<ref name="coroner"/> He brought his mother a present four days before the shooting, though it was several weeks before her birthday.<ref name="mother"/> He had always been very punctual paying his rent, but did not do so in December 1989.<ref name="Citizen2"/><br />
[[Image:Exterior of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Exterior of École Polytechnique de Montréal]]
On [[December 6]], [[1989]], Lépine walked into the École Polytechnique de Montréal. There, he entered a second-floor classroom where he separated the men and women and then ordered the approximately fifty men to leave. Claiming that he was fighting feminism, he shot the nine women who remained, killing six and injuring the rest. After this, Lépine moved to other areas of the building, including the cafeteria, corridors and another classroom. A total of fourteen women (twelve engineering students, one nursing student, and one university employee) were killed, and four men and ten women injured before Lépine turned the gun on himself.<ref name="coroner"/><ref>{{cite web| title =Gunman massacres 14 women| work =Archives| publisher =CBC| date =6 December 1989| url =http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-70-398-2235/disasters_tragedies/montreal_massacre/clip1| format =video stream| accessdate = 2006-12-29}}</ref>

A three-page letter (see below) was found in the pocket of his jacket.<ref name="coroner"/> The letter was never officially made public, but was leaked in November 1990 to [[Francine Pelletier (journalist)|Francine Pelletier]], and published in the newspaper ''[[La Presse]]''. In his suicide letter, Lépine claimed political motives, blaming feminists for ruining his life. He considered himself rational and expressed admiration for [[Denis Lortie]], who had mounted an attack on the [[Quebec National Assembly]] in 1984 for political reasons, killing three Quebec government employees.<ref>{{cite news | last =Pelchat| first =Martin| title =Lépine avait des motifs "politiques"| language =French| publisher =La Presse| date =24 November 1990}}</ref> The letter also contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because of their feminism.<ref>{{cite web| title =A Difficult Story to Tell| work =The Story of the fifth estate| publisher =CBC News | url =http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/history/difficultfour.html | accessdate =2006-12-28}}</ref>

Marc Lépine was buried in the [[Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges]] in Montreal, a few blocks from where he committed the massacre.<ref>{{cite news|last =CBC News| title =Workers locked out at famous Montreal cemetery| publisher =CBC| date = [[2007-05-16]]| url =http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2007/05/16/qc-cemetary0515.html| accessdate =2007-05-21}}</ref>

==Character==
Marc Lépine was described as a shy and uncommunicative person who showed little emotion. He was very organized and precise, and had problems accepting authority which caused some difficulties at school and work. He did not drink or take drugs.<ref name="coroner"/> Lépine was ill at ease around women, and had no known girlfriends. He tended to boss women around and show off his knowledge in front of them.<ref>{{cite news|last =Roux| first =Martine| title =Pour comprendre Marc Lépine| publisher =La Presse| date = [[1999-12-18]]| language = French}}</ref> He spoke out to others about his dislike of feminists, career women and women in traditionally male occupations, such as the police force.<ref name="malarek"/><ref>{{cite news|last =Norris| first =Alexander| title =Lepine was emotionally repressed, pal says| publisher =The Gazette, Montreal| date = [[1990-01-16]]|}}</ref>

A police psychiatrist who interviewed Lépine's family and entourage, and who had access to his letters, suggested that he may have had a serious [[personality disorder]], as he chose the multiple homicide/suicide strategy (killing one’s self after killing others) that is a characteristic of this disorder.<ref name="coroner"/> Other psychiatrists suggested that Lépine was psychotic, having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (and absent) father, while at the same time unconsciously identifying with a violent manhood that dominates women. Other theories were that Lépine's experiences of abuse as a child had caused brain-damage or led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life.<ref>{{cite news | last =Lortie | first = Marie-Claude |title = Poly un an après : Psychose?

==Lépine's suicide statement== <!-- This section is linked from [[École Polytechnique massacre]] -->

The following is a translation of the suicide letter written by Lépine on the day of the shooting.<ref name="Malette">Malette, L. and Chalouh, M. The Montreal Massacre, Gynergy Books, 1991.</ref>
The [http://www.philo5.com/Feminisme-Masculisme/890612%20Lettre%20de%20Marc%20Lepine.htm original letter in French] is also available.
{{quotation|Forgive the mistakes, I had 15 minutes to write this. See also Annex.<br /><br />Would you note that if I commit suicide today 89-12-06 it is not for economic reasons (for I have waited until I exhausted all my financial means, even refusing jobs) but for political reasons. Because I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to their Maker. For seven years life has brought me no joy and being totally blasé, I have decided to put an end to those viragos.<br /><br />

I tried in my youth to enter the Forces as an officer cadet, which would have allowed me possibly to get into the arsenal and precede Lortie in a raid. They refused me because antisocial (sic). I therefore had to wait until this day to execute my plans. In between, I continued my studies in a haphazard way for they never really interested me, knowing in advance my fate. Which did not prevent me from obtaining very good marks despite my theory of not handing in work and the lack of studying before exams.<br /><br />

Even if the Mad Killer epithet will be attributed to me by the media, I consider myself a rational erudite that only the arrival of the Grim Reaper has forced to take extreme acts. For why persevere to exist if it is only to please the government. Being rather backward-looking by nature (except for science), the feminists have always enraged me. They want to keep the advantages of women (e.g. cheaper insurance, extended maternity leave preceded by a preventative leave, etc.) while seizing for themselves those of men.<br /><br />

Thus it is an obvious truth that if the Olympic Games removed the Men-Women distinction, there would be Women only in the graceful events. So the feminists are not fighting to remove that barrier. They are so opportunistic they neglect to profit from the knowledge accumulated by men through the ages. They always try to misrepresent them every time they can. Thus, the other day, I heard they were honoring the Canadian men and women who fought at the frontline during the world wars. How can you explain then that women were not authorized to go to the frontline??? Will we hear of Caesar's female legions and female galley slaves who of course took up 50% of the ranks of history, though they never existed. A real [[Casus Belli]].<br /><br />

Sorry for this too brief letter.<br /><br />

Marc Lépine}}

The letter is followed by the list of nineteen names, with a note at the bottom:
