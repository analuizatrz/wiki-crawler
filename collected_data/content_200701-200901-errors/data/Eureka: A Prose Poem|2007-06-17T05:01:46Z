'''''Eureka''''' (1848) is a work by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] which he subtitled "A [[prose poetry|Prose Poem]]," though it has also been subtitled as "An [[Essay]] on the Material and Spiritual Universe." In it he describes his intuitive conception of the universe. It is dedicated to the German naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].

{{wikisourcepar|Eureka: A Prose Poem}}

''Eureka'' presents a physical/spiritual system for which many of Poe's tales and poems serve as allegories. It was  his last major work and grew out of a two and a half hour lecture entitled "The Universe," delivered on [[February 3]], [[1848]]. Poe wrote the 150-page essay based on the lecture by May of that year. 

The publication of ''Eureka'' brought Poe a vehement anonymous censure, in the ''Literary Review''. This was believed by Poe to have been written by John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (1820-1889), a young theological student, who had previously criticised the work as [[pantheistic]] and "a damnable heresy" that "conscience would compel him to denounce..."<ref>Silverman, Kenneth.

In ''Eureka'', Poe [[Wiktionary:presage|presage]]s modern science with his own concept of the [[Big Bang]]. He postulated that the universe began from a single originating particle or [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]. This particle divides into all the particles of the universe. These particles seek one another because of their originating unity (gravity) resulting in the end of the universe as a single particle.

==Publication history==
Poe persuaded [[George Palmer Putnam]], who had previously taken a chance on Poe by printing his only [[novel]] ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' in England, to publish ''Eureka''.  Poe claimed this work was more important than [[Isaac Newton]]'s discovery of gravity.  Putnam paid Poe fourteen dollars for the work.<ref>Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York City: Cooper Square Press, 1992. ISBN 0815410387  p. 219</ref>  Poe suggested an initial printing of at least one million copies; Putnam settled on 750, of which only 500 copies were sold that year.<ref>Tebbel, John.
