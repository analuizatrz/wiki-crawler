'''Francesco Lamperti''' ([[March 11]], [[1813]]-[[May 1]], [[1892]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] singing teacher.

A native of [[Savonia]], Lamperti attended the [[Milan]] Conservatory, where beginning in 1850 he taught for a quarter of a century.  Upon leaving the school he taught privately.  Among the singers who were his pupils were [[Emma Albani]], [[Italo Campanini]], [[Marie van Zandt]], [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Herbert Witherspoon]], and [[Desirée Artôt]].  His methods were very similar to older Italian methods, and he wrote a number of [[treatise]]s on the subject.  He was also created a [[Order of the Crown of Italy|Commander of the Crown of Italy]] for his services to music.  Lamperti died in [[Como]] in 1892.
