'''Polish October''', also known as '''October of 1956''', '''Polish thaw''' or '''Gomułka thaw''', refers to the change in the [[politics of Poland|Polish internal political scene]] in the second half of 1956. It resulted in [[Władysław Gomułka]]'s faction acquiring power and in the temporary liberalization of life in Poland. Some social scientists term it the '''Polish October Revolution''', which, while less dramatic than the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], might have had an even deeper impact on the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name="Berend">[[Ivan Berend]], ''Central and Eastern Europe, 1944-1993: Detour from the Periphery to the Periphery'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999, ISBN 052166352, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521663520&id=MLXeoc-FfOYC&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=%22Polish+October%22&sig=jKo8GIiUKJao816DrZjZHLcyupU Google Print, p.115-116] </ref>

==Development==
Gomułka's thaw was caused by several factors: the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953 and the resulting [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)|de-Stalinization]] and [[Khrushchev Thaw|Khrushchev's Thaw]], the defection of [[Polish intelligence]] agent [[Józef Światło]] and weakening of [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland]], the unexpected death of [[Polish communist]] leader [[Bolesław Bierut]] in [[Moscow]] in 1956, increasing rivalry between various factions of Polish communists, and growing tensions in Polish society, culminating in the [[Poznań 1956 protests]] (also known as June '56).<ref name="fall">[[Raymond Pearson]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 1998, ISBN 0312174071, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0312174071&id=9EehH16HO48C&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=%22Polish+October%22&sig=m95L6X8X_QJQSCJCZBqNj4LzY7U#PPA59,M1 Google Print, p.58-60]</ref><ref name="Mach">[[Paweł Machcewicz]], "Social Protest and Political Crisis in 1956", which appears on pp. 99-118 of ''Stalinism in Poland'', 1944-1956, ed. and tr. by A.

After the death in March 1956 of the [[General secretary|First Secretary]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], Bolesław Bierut (known as the 'Stalin of Poland'<ref name="BritBier">"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9079145 Bierut, Boleslaw]." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online. Last accessed [[12 April]] [[2007]]</ref>), a brief period of de-Stalinization began, raising popular hope for reform. 

The [[Polish United Workers' Party]] Secretariat decided that Khrushchev's speech&mdash;[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences]]&mdash;should have wide circulation in Poland, a unique decision in the Eastern Bloc. Bierut's successors seized on Khrushchev's condemnation of [[Stalinist]] policy as a perfect opportunity to prove their reformist, democratic credentials, and their willingness to break with the Stalinist legacy. In late March and early April, thousands of Party meetings were held all over Poland, with Politburo and Secretariat blessing. Tens of thousands took part in such meetings in late March and early April. The Secretariat's plan succeeded beyond what they expected. During this period, the whole political atmosphere changed and tough questions were asked about [[Polish communists]]' legitimacy, responsibility for Stalin's crimes, the arrest of the increasingly popular [[Władysław Gomułka]], and issues in Soviet-Polish relations, such as the continued [[Northern Group of Forces|Soviet military presence in Poland]], the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]], the [[Katyn massacre]], the Soviet failure to support the [[Warsaw Uprising]], etc. A new Party Congress was demanded, as was a greater role for the [[Sejm]], and a guarantee of personal liberties. Alarmed by the process, the Party Secretariat decided to withhold the speech from the general public. Public meetings, demonstrations and street marches took place in hundreds of towns across Poland. The meetings were usually organised by local Party cells, local authorities and trade unions. However, official organisers tended to lose control as political content exceeded their original agendas. Crowds often took extremely radical action, in many cases resulting in the unrest on the streets and clashes with police and other law-enforcement agencies. Street activity peaked during and immediately after the Plenum but continued until late in the year.<ref name="Mach"/>

In June 1956, [[Poznań 1956 protests|an insurrection in Poznań]] took place. The workers rioted to protest shortages of food and consumer goods, bad housing, decline in real income, trade relations with the Soviet Union and poor management of the economy. The Polish government initially responded by branding the rioters "[[Agent provocateur|provocateurs]], [[Counterrevolutionary|counterrevolutionaries]] and [[Imperialism|imperialist]] agents".

Soon, however, the party hierarchy recognized the riots had awakened a nationalist movement and reversed their opinion. The rioters became "honest workers with legitimate grievances".

Poznań protests, despite being the largest, were not unique in Poland. The rioters destroyed the militia headquarters and radio-jamming equipment in [[Bydgoszcz]] on November 18, and a crowd in [[Szczecin]] attacked public buildings including a prison, the state prosecutor's office, militia headquarters and the Soviet consulate on December 10. People across the country expressed very strong hatred toward the security police and asked for the dissolution of the public security committee and the punishment of its guiltiest functionaries. Demands were made for the exposure of secret police collaborators, and suspected collaborators were frequently assaulted. In many localities crowds gathered outside the secret police headquarters, shouted hostile slogans and broke its windows. The concurrent upsurge in religious and clerical sentiment meant that hymns were sung, [[Stefan Wyszyński|Cardinal Wyszyński]]'s release and the reinstatement of suppressed bishops was demanded, as were the reintroduction of religious education and [[crucifix]]es in classrooms. Nationalism was the cement of mass mobilisation and dominated public meetings, where patriotic songs and the national anthem were sung, the return of the white eagle to the flag and traditional army uniforms were demanded, and Poland's dependence on the Soviet Union, along with its military presense, were attacked. The return of the [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|eastern territories]] was demanded, as were an explanation for the [[Katyn massacre]] and the elimination of Russian language from the educational curriculum. In the last ten days of October, monuments to liberation by the Red Army were desecrated, red stars from roofs of houses, factories and schools were pulled down, red flags were destroyed and portraits of [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|Rokosovski]], the military commanders in charge of the series of the operations that drove out the Nazi German forces from Poland, were defaced. Mostly in [[Lower Silesia]] (home to many Soviet troops), attempts were made to force entries into the homes of Soviet citizens. However, unlike in Hungary and in Poznań, there was a self-limitation of political demands and behaviour, which were not purely anti-communist and anti-system. The communist authorities were not openly and unequivocally challenged, as in June, and slogans such as "We want free elections", "Down with Communist dictatorship", or "Down with the Party" were much less prevalent. Party committees were not attacked.<ref name="Mach"/>

==The political change==
[[Edward Ochab]], the Polish Prime Minister, proposed the now-[[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitated]] Gomułka to become First Secretary of the Party. Gomułka insisted that he be given real power to implement reforms. One specific condition he set was that the Soviet Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]], who had mobilized troops against the Poznań workers, be removed from the Polish [[Politburo]] and Defense Ministry, to which Ochab agreed. During October's meeting of the Central Committee of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) - VIII Plenum - that began on 19 October, the decision was made to [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitate]] Gomułka, who had previously fallen afoul of the Stalinist hardliners' faction, and elect him to the post of First Secretary of the Central Committee of the PZPR.<ref name="Britannica"> [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-28216 "Poland."] Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved on [[7 April]] [[2007]]</ref><ref name="fall"/> The majority of the Polish leadership, backed by the army and also the Internal Security Corps, brought Gomułka and several associates into the Politburo and designated Gomułka as First Secretary of the Party.

[[Image:TimeCover10Dec1956.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, [[December 10]], [[1956]], profiled Gomułka and his economic and political policies, calling him a ''rebellious compromiser''.<ref name=time>{{cite news | title = Rebellious Compromiser | publisher = Time magazine | date = [[1956-12-10]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808728-1,00.html | accessdate = 2006-10-14 }}</ref>]]
The Soviet leadership viewed events in Poland with alarm. A high-level delegation of the Soviet [[Central Committee]] flew to Poland in an attempt to block Gomułka's return to the party leadership. It was led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and included [[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[Nikolai Bulganin]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Ivan Konev]] and others. The negotiations were tense, with both Polish and Soviet troops being put on alert, engaging in 'manoeuvres' and used as thinly veiled threats.<ref name="minut"/><ref name="Berend"/> Gomułka demanded increased autonomy and permission to carry out some reforms but also reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning communism or its treaties with the Soviet Union.<ref name="Berend"/><ref name="fall"/> The Soviets were also pressured by the Chinese to accommodate the Polish demands,<ref name="Machcewicz">Paweł Machcewicz, [http://www.culture.pl/en/culture/artykuly/es_1956_machcewicz 1956 - a european date]</ref> and increasingly destracted by the events in Hungary.<ref name="Machcewicz"/><ref name="minut">{{cite web | title = Notes from the Minutes of the CPSU CC Presidium Meeting with Satellite Leaders, [[October 24]], [[1956]] | work = The 1956 Hungarian Revolution, A History in Documents | publisher = [[George Washington University]]: The National Security Archive | date = [[November 4]], [[2002]] | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/doc5.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-09-02}}</ref> Eventually, the Soviets agreed on the compromise and Gomułka was confirmed in his new position.

The leadership's stance contributed to the relatively moderate political dimension of social protest in October. Also crucial, though, was the relative impact of nationalism and national emotions. They spurred social protest in June but dampened it in October, when the threat of Soviet invasion against Gomułka and his supporters transformed the social image of [[Polish communists]]. In June, they were still treated as the puppets and servants of alien, anti-Polish interests, and hence excluded from the national community. In October, they became a part of the nation opposing Soviet domination. Gomułka was enthusiastically supported by the great majority of society not primarily as a communist leader, but as a leader of a nation, who by resisting Soviet demands, embodied a national longing for independence and sovereignty. For instance, leaflets found in [[Świdnica]] on October 22 read, "Red Army, go home. Long live Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary, Hero of the Polish Nation!" His name was chanted, along with anti-Soviet slogans, at thousands of meetings. While his anti-Soviet image was obviously mythical and exaggerated, it was justified in the popular imagination by his anti-Stalinist line in 1948 and years of subsequent internment. Thus Polish communists found themselves unexpectedly at the head of a national liberation movement, and the enthusiastic public support offered to Gomułka contributed to the legitimization of communist rule in Poland, which managed to incorporate mass national, anti-Soviet feelings into the prevailing power structures. In Hungary, social protest destroyed the political system; in Poland it was absorbed within it.<ref name="Mach"/>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Wladyslaw Gomulka.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Władysław Gomułka]]
Information about events in Poland reached the people of [[Hungary]] via [[Radio Free Europe]]'s news and commentary services during 19&ndash;[[22 October]] [[1956]]. A student demonstration in [[Budapest]] in support of Gomułka, asking for similar reforms in Hungary, was one of the events that sparked the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].<ref name="UN>[http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf UNITED NATIONS REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE PROBLEM OF HUNGARY]. Page 145, para 441. Last accessed on [[11 April]] [[2007]]</ref> The events of the Hungarian November also helped distract the Soviets and ensure the success of the Polish October.<ref name="fall"/>

Gomułka in his public speech criticized the hardships of [[Stalinism]], and promised reforms to democratize the country; this was received with much enthusiasm by Polish society. By mid-November, Gomułka has secured substantive gains in his negotiations with the Soviets: the cancellation of Poland's existing debts, new preferential trade terms, abandonment of the unpopular Soviet-imposed [[collectivization]] of Polish agriculture, and permission to liberalize policy towards the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name="fall"/> In December, the status of Soviet forces in Poland, the [[Northern Group of Forces]], was [[Status of Forces Agreement|finally regulated]].<ref name="Golon">{{pl icon}} Mirosław Golon, [http://historicus.umk.pl/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=12 Północna Grupa Wojsk Armii Radzieckiej w Polsce w latach 1945-1956.

In the aftermath of the October events, [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] and many other Soviet "advisers" left Poland, signaling that Moscow was willing to grant Polish communists slightly more independence. The Polish government rehabilitated many victims of the Stalinist era, and many political prisoners were set free. Among them was cardinal [[Stefan Wyszyński]].<ref name="Britannica"/> The [[Polish legislative election, 1957]] was much more liberal than that of 1952, although still not considered free by Western standards.<ref name="Staar">Richard F. Staar, ''Elections in Communist Poland'', Midwest Journal of Political Science, Vol. 2, No. 2 (May, 1958), pp. 200-218, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0026-3397(195805)2%3A2%3C200%3AEICP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z JSTOR]</ref> 

Gomułka however couldn't and didn't want to reject communism or Soviet domination; he could only steer Poland towards increased independence and "Polish national communism".<ref name="Berend"/><ref name="fall"/> Because of these limitations, recognized by the Soviets, the limited Polish revolution succeeded where the Hungarian one didn't.<ref name="Berend"/> [[Norman Davies]] sums up the effect as a transformation of Poland from [[puppet state]] to [[client state]];<ref name="Berend"/> [[Raymond Pearson]] similarly states that Poland changed from a Soviet [[colony]] to a [[dominion]].<ref name="fall"/>

Initially very popular for his reforms and seeking a "Polish way to socialism",<ref name=time/> as the optimistic term for that era&mdash;''Gomułka's thaw''&mdash;indicates, Gomułka gradually softened his opposition to Soviet pressures and the late-1950s hopes for major political change in Poland were replaced with growing disillusionment in the 1960s. In the end, Gomułka failed in his goal to salvage communism&mdash;or socialism&mdash;in Poland.<ref name="Berend"/> [[Culture in modern Poland|Society became more liberal]] (as seen, for instance, in the achievements of the [[Polish Film School]] and creation of such controversial movies as [[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]), and a [[civil society]] started to develop, but half-hearted democratization was not enough to satisfy the Polish public.<ref name="Berend"/> By the time of the [[March 1968 events]] Gomułka's thaw would be long over, and increasing [[shortage economy|economic problems]] and popular discontent would end up removing Gomułka from power in 1970&mdash;ironically, in a situation similar to the protests that once propelled him to power.<ref name="Berend"/><ref name="historybuffalo">[http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/longhist6.html Poland - The Historical Setting: Chapter 6: The Polish People's Republic.] Polish Academic Information Center, [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]].  Retrieved on [[14 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

Nonetheless, some social scientists such as [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] or [[Frank Gibney]] refer to these changes as a [[revolution]]&mdash;one less dramatic than its Hungarian counterpart, but one which may have had an even more profound impact on the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name="Berend"/> [[Timothy Garton Ash]] calls the Polish October the most significant event in the [[history of Poland (1945-1989)|post-war history of Poland]] until the [[history of Solidarity|rise of Solidarity]].<ref name="Ash">{{cite book | last = Garton Ash | first = Timothy | authorlink = Timothy Garton Ash | editor = | others = | title = The Polish Revolution: Solidarity | origdate = | url = | format = | accessdate = | edition = | date = 2002 | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | location = | language = | id = ISBN 0300095686 | pages =}}</ref> As [[Ivan Berend]] notes, while the effects of the Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, there is no doubt it set up the course for the eventual [[fall of communism]] in the People's Republic of Poland.<ref name="Berend"/>
