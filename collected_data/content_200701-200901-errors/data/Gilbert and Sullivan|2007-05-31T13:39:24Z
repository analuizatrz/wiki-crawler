[[Librettist]] '''[[W. S. Gilbert|William Schwenck Gilbert]]''' (1836–1911) and [[composer]] '''[[Arthur Sullivan|Arthur Seymour Sullivan]]''' (1842–1900) collaborated on a series of fourteen [[comic opera]]s in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[England]] between 1871 and 1896.

The Gilbert and Sullivan works have enjoyed broad and enduring international success, particularly in the English-speaking world.  ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', in particular, introduced innovations in content and form that directly influenced the [[musical theatre]] of the 20th century.<ref name=PeterDowns>Downs, Peter.

Gilbert, who wrote the words, created fanciful worlds for these operas, where an absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion.  In these worlds fairies rub elbows with English lords, flirting is a capital offence, gondoliers ascend to the monarchy, and pirates turn out to be noblemen who have gone wrong.

Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two – Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict.  In addition, Gilbert imbued his [[libretto|libretti]] with "topsy-turvy" situations in which the social order was turned upside down.  After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.<ref>See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3</ref>  In addition, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at those in the circles of privilege, while Sullivan was eager to socialize among the wealthy and titled people who would become his friends and patrons.<ref>See, e.g. Jacobs, Arthur (1992); Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html The Life of W.S.

For over a century, until it closed in 1982, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] performed the Gilbert and Sullivan operas (controlling the British copyrights to the works until 1961) and exercised great influence over the style and traditions for performing these works.

[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html ''The Life of W. S. Gilbert''.] The Gilbert and Sullivan archive at Boise State University, Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref>  Gilbert illustrated some of his father's stories,<ref name=CrowtherLife /> and in 1861, he began to write illustrated stories, poems and articles of his own to supplement his income. The poems, published as the [[Bab Ballads]], and the short stories would later be mined as a source of ideas for his plays, including the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.<ref>Stedman (1996), pp. 26-29, 123-4, and the introduction to Gilbert's ''[[Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales]]''.</ref>  In the Bab Ballads, Gilbert had developed a unique "topsy-turvy" style, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd.  Gilbert had already produced half of his more than 75 plays and operas by 1871, and he also had developed his innovative theories on the art of stage direction, following theatrical reformer [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]].

Theatre in Britain, at that time Gilbert began writing, was in disrepute,<ref>Bond, Jessie.

Those two intervening years were very productive for Gilbert and continued to shape his theatrical style.  He continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas ''[[Our Island Home]]'' (1870) and ''[[A Sensation Novel]]'' (1871), and the blank verse comedies ''[[The Princess]]'' (1870), ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1870), and ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea]]''.  Gilbert would later find inspiration in many of his early plays and operas for the collaborations with Sullivan.

===Sullivan before Gilbert===
{{Further|[[Arthur Sullivan]]}}
[[Image:Crystal Palace.PNG|thumb|right|200px|The Crystal Palace, where several early Sullivan works premiered]]Sullivan was born in London on [[May 13]] [[1842]].  His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of 8, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band.  In school he began to compose [[anthem]]s and songs, and in 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn prize and studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and at [[Leipzig]], where he also took up [[conducting]].  His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a set of incidental music to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]''. Revised and expanded, it was performed at [[the Crystal Palace]] in 1862 and was an immediate sensation.  He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto and his successful ''[[Overture di Ballo]]'', in 1870.<ref>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/lawrence/lawrence_1.html Interview by Arthur H. Lawrence, Part 1], ''The Strand Magazine'', Volume xiv, No.84 (December 1897) See also [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/letters/001.html Sullivan's Letter to ''The Times''], [[Oct. 27]] [[1881]], Issue 30336, pg. 8 col C</ref>

His early works for the voice included ''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]'' (1864); an [[oratorio]], ''The Prodigal Son'' (1869); and a dramatic [[cantata]], ''On Shore and Sea'' (1871).  He also composed a ballet, ''L'Île Enchantée'' and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays.  Other early pieces that were praised were his ''[[Symphony in E, Irish|Irish Symphony]]'', ''[[Cello Concerto (Sullivan)|Concerto for Cello and Orchestra]]'', and ''[[Overture in C (In Memoriam)]]'' (all three of which premiered in 1866).<ref>[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/sullorch.htm#concerto Description and analysis of Sullivan's early orchestral works]</ref>  These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat during this period.  He also worked as a church organist and composed numerous [[hymn]]s, popular songs, and [[parlour ballads]].<ref name=Turnbull>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/sullivan2a.html Stephen Turnbull's Biography of W. S. Gilbert] at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive. Downloaded 22 November 2006</ref> 

Sullivan's first successful comic opera was ''[[Cox and Box]]'' (1866), followed by ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (1867), both with librettos by [[Francis Cowley Burnand|F. C. Burnand]].

==Operas==
===First collaborations: ''Thespis'' and ''Trial by Jury''===
The first Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration was ''[[Thespis (operetta)|Thespis]]'', produced at the large [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], an extravaganza in which the gods of the classical world, who have become elderly and ineffective, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of actors and actresses.  The piece echoed and may even have borrowed from ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'' and ''[[La belle Hélène]]'',<ref>Tillett, Selwyn and Spencer, Roderic (2002). [http://www.chimesmusicaltheatre.co.uk/Thespis.pdf "Forty Years of Thespis Scholarship".] (PDF). Chimes Musical Theatre.  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]]</ref> two of [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s mixtures of political satire and [[grand opera]] parody,<ref>Jean-Bernard Piat: ''Guide du mélomane averti'', Le Livre de Poche 8026, Paris 1992.</ref> which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.  ''Thespis'' opened at the Gaiety Theatre on [[Boxing Day]] in 1871 and ran for 63 performances. Gilbert directed the production himself, as he did all of the G&S operas.  Unlike the later G&S works, however, ''Thespis'' was hastily prepared and of a more risqué nature, like Gilbert's earlier [[travesty|travesties]], with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors.  Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned.  The musical score to ''Thespis'' was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and the Act II ballet.  There have been numerous revivals, either with original scores or adaptations of Sullivan's other music.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/thespis/html/thespis_home.html Thespis or The Gods Grown Old.]  The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University.  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref>

''Thespis'' outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season and was later revived for a benefit performance.  No one at the time, however, anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration, and Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together for another four years.  Gilbert worked with Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872) and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), as well as writing several other operetta libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas, adaptations from novels, and translations from the French.  Sullivan also was not idle.  He completed his ''Festival [[Te Deum]]'' (1872), another oratorio, ''The Light of the World'' (1873), his only [[song cycle]] ''[[The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens]]'' (1871), [[incidental music]] to ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1874) and more [[hymn]]s, including "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]" (1872), songs and parlour ballads.  In short, during these years, each man became more eminent in his field.
 
By early 1875, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] was managing the [[Royalty Theatre]], and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Périchole]]''.  Gilbert had already written such a short piece on commission from producer-composer [[Carl Rosa]], whose wife's unexpected death had left the libretto an orphan.  Carte suggested that it be set to music by Sullivan.  Sullivan was delighted with it, and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was composed in a matter of weeks.  The little piece, starring Sullivan's brother, [[Fred Sullivan|Fred]], as the Learned Judge, was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of ''La Périchole'' and being revived at another theatre.<ref>Walbrook, H.

Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]], which quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of ''Trial by Jury'' to him: "As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time."</ref>

===''Sorcerer'' to ''Pirates''===
[[Image:Sorc-Pin-Trial.jpg|thumb|400px|An early poster showing scenes from ''The Sorcerer'', ''Pinafore'', and ''Trial by Jury''.]]
''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877) was the first full-length example of what came to be known as the [[Savoy Operas]] (although the Savoy Theatre had yet to be built).  Carte, who was now interested in developing an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy [[travesty|burlesque]]s and badly translated French operettas then dominating the London stage, asked Gilbert for a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening's entertainment. Gilbert found a subject in one of his short stories, "The Elixir of Love", which concerned a [[Cockney]] businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular).  Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that ''The Sorcerer'' opened as a fully polished production at the [[Opera Comique]], in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed ''Thespis''.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/sorcerer/html/index.html ''The Sorcerer''.]  The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University.  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref>  The triumvirate of Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte was now an established entity that would survive through a dozen more collaborations.

With ''The Sorcerer'', the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system came into being. Previously, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with ''Thespis''. From ''The Sorcerer'' onwards, Gilbert would no longer hire stars; he would create them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars. Gilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage. Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation.  The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre. 

The libretto of ''The Sorcerer'' relied on [[stock character]] types, many of which were familiar from European opera: the heroic protagonist ([[tenor]]) and his love-interest ([[soprano]]); the elderly woman with fading charms ([[contralto]]) and a supporting [[bass-baritone]] or two.  The "patter" or comic [[baritone]], was often the leading role of their comic operas.  This character most often gets to sing the speedy [[patter song]]s.  Gilbert and Sullivan also fully integrated the male and female choruses into the action, making them, collectively, as important as any principal character. 

The repertory system ensured that the comic patter man who would perform the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', then join the army as Major-General Stanley in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in ''The Sorcerer'' would transform into Little Buttercup in ''Pinafore'', then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in ''Pirates''.  Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged for ''The Sorcerer'' and ''Pinafore'' would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage.  These included [[George Grossmith]], the comic baritone; [[Rutland Barrington]], lyric baritone and character actor; [[Richard Temple]], the bass-baritone; [[Jessie Bond]], the soubrette; and [[Rosina Brandram]] the contralto.

Gilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878), satirizing incompetent government officials, the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status.  Hundreds of unauthorized, or "pirated", productions of this work appeared in America.<ref>Rosen, Zvi S. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963540 The Twilight of the Opera Pirates: A Prehistory of the Right of Public Performance for Musical Compositions.] ''Cardozo Arts & Entertainment Law Journal'', Vol. 24, 2007.  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]]. </ref>  ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1879), written in a fit of pique at the [[United States|American]] [[copyright]] pirates, also poked fun at [[grand opera]] conventions, sense of duty, family obligation, and the relevance of a liberal education.

===Savoy Theatre: ''Patience'' to ''Gondoliers''===
''[[Patience (operetta)|Patience]]'' (1881) satirized the [[aesthetic movement]] in general, and the poet and aesthete [[Algernon Swinburne]] in particular, as well as male vanity and chauvinism in the military.  During the run of ''Patience'', Carte built the large, modern [[Savoy Theatre]], which became the partnership's permanent home.  It was the first theatre (indeed the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting.<ref>[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SavoyTheatre.htm Savoy Theatre, The Strand, WC2.] arthurlloyd.co.uk.  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref>  ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882) was the first of their works to open at the Savoy. It poked fun at English law and the [[House of Lords]] and made much of the war between the sexes. ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884) spoofed women's education and male chauvinism.

In 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre, so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study.  Gilbert had referred to the new technology in ''Pinafore'' in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service.  Sullivan also installed a telephone at his home, and on [[May 13]] [[1883]], at a party to celebrate the composer's 41st birthday, the guests, including the Prince of Wales (later [[Edward VII]]), heard a direct relay of parts of ''Iolanthe'' from the Savoy.  According to [[Ian Campbell Bradley| Ian Bradley]], this was probably the first live "broadcast" of an opera.<ref>Bradley (1996), p. 176.</ref>

[[Image:The_Mikado_Three_Little_Maids.jpg|thumb|right|Lithograph from the Mikado]]The most successful of the Savoy Operas was ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy in a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] setting. ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), a topsy-turvy take on Victorian [[melodrama]], was less successful. ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888), their only joint work with a serious ending, concerns a pair of strolling players—a jester and a singing girl—who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the [[Tower of London]]. ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889) was a recapitulation of many of the themes of the earlier operas, taking place in a kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of "republican equality." <ref>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gondoliers/html/index.html ''The Gondoliers''.]  The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University.  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref>

===Carpet quarrel===
Gilbert and Sullivan quarrelled several times over the choice of a subject.  After both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore'', which were less successful than the seven other operas from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' through ''The Gondoliers'', Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him.  While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works.  On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.<ref name=Carpet>Crowther, Andrew.[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html The Carpet Quarrel Explained.] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University.  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref>

During the run of ''The Gondoliers'', however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:

:After all, the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May, 1891, a year after the end of the "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone."<ref name=Carpet/>

Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building a theatre in London for the production of new English grand operas, with Sullivan's ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' as the inaugural work. While the protracted quarrel worked itself out in the courts and in public, Gilbert wrote ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'' with [[Alfred Cellier]] and the flop ''[[Haste to the Wedding]]'' with [[George Grossmith]],<ref name=PlayList>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/html/other_gilbert.html Gilbert's Plays.] The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive at Boise State University.  Retrieved on [[2007-05-21]].</ref> and Sullivan wrote ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' with Sidney Grundy, in addition to ''Ivanhoe''. 

In 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair and their producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, [[William Chappell|Tom Chappell]], stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded.<ref>Wolfson, p. 7.</ref>

===Last works and legacy===
[[Image:Utopia Limited Poster.jpg|thumb|500px|The Drawing Room Scene from Act II of Utopia.]]
''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896) was an outright failure.<ref>Wolfson, passim</ref> Neither work entered the "canon" of regularly-performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s.  Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'', 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting [[Nancy McIntosh]], his protégée from ''Utopia'', led to Sullivan's refusal.<ref> Wolfson, pp. 61-65.</ref>

After ''The Grand Duke'', the partners saw no reason to work together again. Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died four years later, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), and ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901) (finished by [[Edward German]] after Sullivan's death).  Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. He wrote only one more comic opera, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' ([[1909]]; music by [[Edward German]]), which was not a success.  [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] died in 1901, and his widow, [[Helen D'Oyly Carte|Helen]], and then his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], followed by his granddaughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte|Bridget]], continued to direct the activities of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which staged revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas until it closed in 1982.  

Because of the unusual success of the operas, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company were<!--British usage--> able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the [[J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company]], and to amateur societies.  For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired in 1961, and even afterwards, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide, creating a "performing tradition" for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors.  D'Oyly Carte also produced several attractive recordings of most of the operas, helping to keep them popular through the decades.  Today, numerous repertory companies, opera companies and amateur societies continue to produce the works.

The American and British [[musical theatre|musical]] owes a tremendous debt to G&S, who were admired by and copied by early authors and composers such as [[Ivan Caryll]], [[Adrian Ross]], [[Lionel Monckton]], [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Guy Bolton]], [[Victor Herbert]], and [[Ivor Novello]], and later [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Jerome Kern]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]].<ref>[Bradley, Ian C. ''Oh Joy! Oh Rapture! The Enduring Phenomenon of Gilbert and Sullivan'' Oxford University Press (2005), p. 9. ISBN 0195167007</ref> 

Gilbert and Sullivan's work also provides a rich cultural resource outside of their influence upon musicals. The works of Gilbert and Sullivan are themselves frequently pastiched. Well known examples of this include [[Tom Lehrer]]'s [[The Elements (song)|The Elements]], [[Allan Sherman]]'s and [[Anna Russell]]'s famous routines, and the animated TV series, ''[[Animaniacs]]''' ''HMS Yakko'' episode.  Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature, film and television in various ways that include use of Sullivan's music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera.  There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biopics, such as [[Mike Leigh]]'s ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]''.
{{cquotetxt|The musical is not, of course, the only cultural form to show the influence of G&S.  Even more direct heirs are those witty and satrical songwriters found on both sides of the Atlantic in the twentieth century like [[Michael Flanders]] and [[Donald Swann]] in the United Kingdom and [[Tom Lehrer]] in the United States.  The influrence of Gilbert is discernible in a vein of British comedy that runs through [[John Betjeman]]'s verse via [[Monty Python]] and [[Private Eye]] to... television series like ''Yes, Minister''... where the emphasis is on wit, irony, and poking fun at the establishment from within it in a way which manages to be both disrespectful of authority and yet cosily comfortable and urbane.| [[Ian Campbell Bradley|Ian Bradley]]|''Oh Joy! Oh Rapture! The Enduring Phenomenon of Gilbert and Sullivan'' ISBN 0195167007}}

It is not surprising, given the focus of Gilbert on politics, that politicians have often found inspiration in these works.  U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William Rehnquist]] added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the [[Lord Chancellor]] in a production of [[Iolanthe]],<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=353263 Sporting stripes set Rehnquist apart], Sept. 4, 2005, Journal Sentinel Online. Downloaded 26 May 2007.</ref> Alternatively, [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Chancellor Charles Falconer]] is recorded as objecting so strongly to Iolanthe's comic portrayal of Lord Chancellors that he supported moves to disband the office.<ref name="Green" /> British politicians, beyond quoting some of the more famous lines, have also delivered speeches in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches.  These include Conservative [[Peter Lilley]]'s speech mimicking the form of "I've got a little list" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', listing those he was against, including "sponging socialists" and "young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue".<ref name="Green" />

==A note on terminology==
Gilbert and Sullivan scholars<ref>including Crowther, Stedman, Bailey, Bradley, Ainger, and Jacobs</ref> call the G&S works "[[comic opera]]s," because Gilbert, Sullivan, Carte and other Victorian-era British composers, librettists and producers, including the [[German Reed Entertainments|German Reeds]], [[Frederic Clay]], and F. C. Burnand, called British works of this kind "comic operas" to distinguish their content and style from that of the continental European operettas that they wished to displace, as discussed above.  However, the ''Penguin Opera Guides'' classify G&S as "operetta".<ref>''The New Penguin Opera Guide'', ed. Amanda Holden, Penguin Books, London 2001 and ''The Penguin Concise Guide to Opera'', ed. Amanda Holden, Penguin Books, London 2005 both note: "[[Operetta]] is the internationally recognized term for the type of work on which William Schwenck Gilbert and Sullivan collaborated under Richard D'Oyly Carte's management (1875-96), but they themselves used the words 'comic opera'".</ref>  This classification is shared by the ''Oxford Dictionary of Opera''<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', ed. John Warrack and Ewan West, Oxford University Press 1992</ref> and the ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera''.<ref>''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'', 4 vols, ed. Stanley Sadie, Macmillan, New York 1992</ref>  This article adopts the terms "comic operas" or "Savoy opera" to describe the Gilbert and Sullivan collaborations.
