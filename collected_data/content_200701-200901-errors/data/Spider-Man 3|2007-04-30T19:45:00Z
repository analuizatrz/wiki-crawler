== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

After finally being able to find a balance between being [[Spider-Man]], and spending time with [[Mary Jane Watson]], Peter Parker begins to feel secure in his life. One night, Peter finds his costume has changed; it's now black, with the ability to enhance his powers. Bringing out the darker, more vengeful side, the suit begins to influence Peter.

== Production ==
In March 2004, with ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' being released the coming June, [[Marvel Studios]] had begun developing ''Spider-Man 3'' for a release date of 2007.<ref>{{cite news | author=Nicole Laporte | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117901100.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Spidey spins web for a third time | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2004-03-02]] | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  By the release of ''Spider-Man 2'', a release date for ''Spider-Man 3'' had been set for [[May 2]], [[2007]] before production on the sequel had begun.<ref>{{cite news | author=Gabriel Snyder | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117907347.html?categoryid=10&cs=1 | title=Spidey swings to new heights | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2004-07-05]] |  accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> The date was later changed to [[May 4]]. In January 2005, Sony Pictures Entertainment completed a seven-figure deal with [[screenwriter]] [[Alvin Sargent]], who had penned ''Spider-Man 2'', to work on ''Spider-Man 3'' with an option to write a fourth film.<ref>{{cite news | author=Nicole Laporte | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117916239.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Sargent to spin more Spidey tales | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2005-01-12]] | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  

===Writing===
The third film's story continued with the conflicts and the characters that had surfaced in previous films. ''Spider-Man 3'' explores the corruption of hero and villain alike, with main characters becoming embroiled in scandals and emotional dramas.<ref name="inner">{{cite news | author=Sheigh Crabtree | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-ca-spiderman15apr15,1,7495611.story | title=The inner life of the super-villain | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=[[2007-04-15]] | accessdate=2007-04-15 }}</ref> Immediately after ''Spider-Man 2'''s release, [[Ivan Raimi]] wrote a treatment over two months, which was so complex that Sargeant considered cutting it into two films, before realizing he could not create a successful climax for the third film to lead onto the fourth. Sam Raimi decided to use the film to explore Peter learning that he is not a perfect avenger, and that there also can be humanity in those he considers criminals.<ref name="forgiveness">{{cite news | author = Heather Newgen | title = Spider-Man 3 Interviews: Director Sam Raimi | publisher = Superherohype.com | date = [[2007-04-21]] | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=5542 | accessdate = 2007-04-21}}</ref> He took the opportunity to make M.J.'s life torturous, similar to Peter's various problems during the second film, grafting the [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] onto Peter to do this. Maguire relished the opportunity to play a less timid Parker, and to add to this there was the presence of rival love interest [[Gwen Stacy]], as portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]]. Of the villains that were possible for the film, [[Ben Kingsley]] was involved in negotiations to play the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] before the character was cut.<ref name="web">{{cite news | author = Steve Daly | title = World Wide Web | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2007-04-17]] | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035326_3,00.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref>

Sargent brought back [[Harry Osborn]] as a more formidable adversary for Spider-Man, with Raimi wanting to conclude Harry's storyline.<ref name="forgiveness"/> While Osborn had been depicted as taking up his father's Green Goblin mantle in most non-film stories, or the [[Harry Osborn#Ultimate Harry Osborn|Ultimate Hobgoblin]] in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] comics continuity, Raimi had said at [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2006 that Harry would be neither, but instead "somewhere between".<ref>{{cite news | author=Larry Carroll | url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1537122/07252006/story.jhtml | title='Spider-Man 3' Cast Confirms Love Triangle, Death, Soul-Sucking Costume | publisher=[[MTV]] | date=[[2006-07-26]] | accessdate=2006-08-27 }}</ref> Raimi ultimately titled Harry Osborn the New Goblin, and named his glider the Sky Stick.<ref name="premiere">{{cite news | author=Tom Roston | url=http://www.premiere.com/features/3346/the-secrets-of-spider-man-3.html | title=The Secrets of Spider-Man 3 | publisher=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | pages=62,65, 118 | date=January/February 2007 | accessdate=2006-12-14 }}</ref>  Actor [[James Franco]], who portrays Harry in the film, described the character's villainy as realistic: "It's not just that he turns dark just because it's fun.

[[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] was also added, a character which Tobey Maguire had expressed interest in as a future adversary for Spider-Man during press for ''Spider-Man 2''.<ref>{{cite news | author=Chris Hewitt | title=Spidey's back | publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=August 2004 | accessdate=2006-11-10 }}</ref> While Sandman is a petty criminal in the comics, the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Ben's killer in order to further Peter's guilt over his uncle's death,<ref name="arad IGN">{{cite news|author=Stax|title=IGN Interview: Avi Arad|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2007-03-05]]|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/770/770167p1.html|accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> as well as challenging Peter's simplistic perception of the event.<ref name="forgiveness"/> [[Thomas Haden Church]] knew Raimi as he had been approached for the director's film ''[[The Gift (film)|The Gift]]'' years before and was approached for Sandman because of his award-winning performance in ''[[Sideways]]'':<ref name="enter">{{cite news | author=Edward Douglas | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=4599 | title= Exclusive: Enter Sandman! | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=[[2006-08-01]] | accessdate=2006-08-25 }}</ref>  Church accepted the role of Sandman despite the lack of a script at the time. The film's Sandman possesses sympathy similarly exhibited by [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] in his portrayals of misunderstood creatures, as well as [[Frankenstein's monster]] and the [[Golem]].<ref name="sense">{{cite news | author = Andy Khouri | title = TALKING (SPIDER) SENSE WITH THOMAS HADEN CHURCH | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = [[2007-04-26]] | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=10403 | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>  Sandman was also influenced by the 2000s incarnations of sympathetic monsters [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]]. Church described the attitude of Sandman, "Villains with a conscience have this sad realization of who they are, and the monster they've become — there's a sense of regret. So at the end of these movies there's a dramatic resonance that really stays with the audience."<ref name="inner" />

Eddie Brock, Junior, the human part of Venom, serves as a mirror to Peter Parker, with both characters having similar jobs and romantic interests, though Brock differs from Parker in having a bad childhood.<ref name="igncon" /> Brock's actions as a journalist in ''Spider-Man 3'' also represent contemporary themes of paparazzi and tabloid journalism.<ref name="inner" />

===Filming===
The film's budget is officially $258 million, which makes it the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film]] ever made in nominal [[U.S. dollar]]s, breaking ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'s'' budget record of $207 million.

Principal photography for ''Spider-Man 3'' began on [[January 16]], [[2006]] and wrapped in July 2006 after over a hundred days of filming.

[[John Dykstra]], who won the [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] for his work on ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', declined to work on the third film as visual effects supervisor.  Dykstra's colleague, Scott Stokdyk, took his place as supervisor.<ref>{{cite news | author=Sheigh Crabtree | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000837503 | title='Spider' man Dykstra will roll 'Wheels' | publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=[[2005-03-14]] | accessdate=2006-09-20 }}</ref> Sony Pictures Imageworks designed specific computer programs that did not exist when ''Spider-Man 3'' began production to help create performances and shots needed for the film. In addition to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1/16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger.  Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using [[computer-generated imagery]] so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models.<ref name="answered">{{cite news | author=Grant Curtis | url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/spiderman3/blog/archives/2006/10/grants_trivia_questions_answer.php | title=Grant's Trivia Questions Answered! | publisher=Spider-Man 3 Official Movie Blog | date=[[2006-10-21]] | accessdate=2006-10-23 }}</ref>

The creation of Sandman took three years.  To understand the effects of sand for the character's creation, experiments were done with sand, such as splashing, launching at stuntmen, and pouring over ledges.  The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman.<ref>{{cite news | author = Heather Newgen | title = Spider-Man 3 Interviews: Arad, Ziskin and Curtis | publisher = SuperHeroHype.com | date = [[2007-04-22]] | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=5551 | accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>  For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied.<ref name="enter" />  With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead.<ref name="premiere" /> In a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman's chest, [[congenital disorder|congenital]] [[amputation|amputee]] boxer [[Baxter Humby]] took Tobey Maguire's place in filming the scene.  Humby, who was born without his right hand, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman's chest.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.badtaste.it/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3783 | title=An Exclusive interview with Spider-Man! | publisher=Bad Taste | date=[[2006-08-23]] | accessdate=2006-08-25 }}</ref>

The suit [[Topher Grace]] had to wear as Venom had a webbing [[motif]] unlike the comic incarnation. The motif was added by the film design department to give a sense of life to the symbiote, giving it the appearance of gripping onto the character's body.<ref>{{cite news|title=E.J.

The costume took an hour to put on, though [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetics]] took four hours to apply. Grace also wore fangs for his character, which bruised his gums.<ref>{{cite news | author = Heather Newgen | title = Spider-Man 3 Interviews: Topher Grace | publisher = Superherohype.com | date = [[2007-04-22]] | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=5554 | accessdate = 2007-04-23}}</ref>

===Music===
Originally, [[Danny Elfman]], the composer for the previous installments, did not plan to return for the third installment of ''Spider-Man'' because of difficulties with director Sam Raimi.
