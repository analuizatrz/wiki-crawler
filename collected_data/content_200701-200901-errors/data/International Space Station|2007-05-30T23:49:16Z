The '''International Space Station''' ('''ISS''') is a research facility currently being [[ISS assembly sequence|assembled]] in [[outer space]]. The station is in a [[low Earth orbit]]: its altitude varies from 319.6 km to 346.9 km above the surface of the [[Earth]] (approximately 199 miles to 215 miles). It travels at an [[Velocity|average speed]] of 27,744 km (17,240 miles) per hour, completing 15.7 orbits per day. The ISS is a joint project between five space agencies: the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA, [[United States]]), the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roskosmos, [[Russia|Russian Federation]]), the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA, [[Japan]]), the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA, [[Canada]]) and the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA, [[Europe]]).<ref>10 of its member states are currently participating; [[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Portugal]], and the [[United Kingdom]] chose not to participate; [[Greece]] and [[Luxembourg]] joined ESA later.{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=ESA - Human Spaceflight and Exploration - European Participating States|accessdate=2005-07-03|publisher=ESA|language=English}}</ref>

The [[Brazilian Space Agency]] (AEB, [[Brazil]]) participates through a separate contract with NASA. The [[Italian Space Agency]] similarly has separate contracts for various activities not done in the framework of ESA's ISS works (where [[Italy]] also fully participates).

The ISS is a continuation of what began as the U.S. [[Space Station Freedom]], the funding for which was cut back severely. It represents a merger of Freedom with several other previously planned space stations: Russia's [[Zvezda (ISS)|Mir 2]], the planned European [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] and the Japanese [[Japanese Experiment Module|Experiment Module]]. Construction of the station is currently underway. The projected completion date is 2010, but the ISS is already larger than any previous space station.

The ISS has been continuously inhabited since [[Expedition 1|the first resident crew]] entered the station on [[November 2]] [[2000]], thereby providing a permanent human presence in space. The crew of [[Expedition 15]] are currently aboard. The station is serviced primarily by Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] and [[Progress spacecraft]] and by U.S. [[Space Shuttle]] orbiters. At present the station has a capacity for a crew of three. Early crewmembers all  came from the Russian or U.S. space programs.  German ESA astronaut [[Thomas Reiter]] joined the [[Expedition 13]] crew in July 2006, becoming the first crewmember from another [[List of space agencies|space agency]]. The station has however been visited by [[List of International Space Station visitors|astronauts from 14 countries]], and the [[Expedition 16]] crew will include members from all five space agencies forming the ISS partnership. ISS was also the destination of the first five [[Space tourism|space tourist]]s.

==Origins and start of the program==
[[Image:Sts088-703-019e.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Zarya and Node 1 in 1998]]
In the early 1980s, NASA planned [[Space Station Freedom]] as a counterpart to the Soviet [[Salyut]] and [[Mir]] space stations. It never left the drawing board, and with the end of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Cold War]] it was cancelled. The end of the [[Space race]] prompted the U.S. administration officials to start negotiations with international partners Europe, Russia, Japan and Canada in the early 1990s, in order to build a truly international space station. This project was first announced in 1993 and was called Space Station Alpha.<ref name="gao">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/151975.pdf |title=''Space Station: Impact of the Expanded Russian Role on Funding and Research''|accessdate=2006-11-03 |author=GAO |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=1994 |month=June |format=PDF |work= |publisher=GAO |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> It was planned to combine the proposed space stations of all participating space agencies: NASA's [[Space Station Freedom]], Russia's [[Mir-2]] (the successor to the Mir space station, the core of which is now [[Zvezda (ISS)|Zvezda]]) and ESA's [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] that was planned to be a stand-alone spacelab.

Throughout the 1990s, [[construction delay]]s hit the project, budget projections were heavily revised and the ISS structure was modified frequently. The ISS has been, as of today, far more expensive than originally anticipated. The ESA estimates the overall cost from the start of the project in the late 1980s to the prospective end in 2016 to be in the region of [[United States dollar|$]]130 billion ([[Euro|€]]100 billion).<ref name = "costs">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 9 August 2005 | url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAQHA0VMOC_iss_0.html | title = How Much Does It Cost? | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = European Space Agency | accessmonthday = 18 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

The first section, the [[Zarya|Zarya Functional Cargo Block]], was put in orbit in November 1998 on a Russian [[Proton rocket]]. Two further pieces (the [[Unity Module]] and [[Zvezda (ISS)|Zvezda service module]]) were added before the first crew, [[Expedition 1]], was sent. [[Expedition 1]] docked to the ISS on [[November 2]], [[2000]], and consisted of U.S. [[astronaut]] [[William Shepherd]] and two Russian cosmonauts, [[Yuri Gidzenko]] and [[Sergei Krikalev]].

==The Columbia disaster and changes in construction plans==
[[Image:STS-107 launch.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] lifting off on its [[STS-107|final mission]].]]

===Columbia disaster and consequences===
After the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|breakup]] of [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on [[February 1]] [[2003]], and the subsequent two and a half year suspension of the U.S. [[Space Shuttle program]], followed by problems with resuming flight operations in 2005, there was some uncertainty over the future of the ISS until 2006.

The Space Shuttle Program resumed flight on [[July 26]] [[2005]] with the [[STS-114]] mission of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']]. This mission to the ISS was intended both to test new safety measures implemented since the Columbia disaster, and to deliver supplies to the station. Although the mission succeeded safely, it was not without risk; foam was shed by the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]], leading NASA to announce future missions would be grounded until this issue was resolved. 

Between the Columbia disaster and the resumption of Shuttle launches crew exchanges were carried out solely using the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. Starting with [[Expedition 7]], two-astronaut caretaker crews were launched, instead of the previous crews of three. Because the ISS had not been visited by a shuttle for an extended period, a larger than planned amount of waste accumulated, temporarily hindering station operations in 2004. However [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] transports and the [[STS-114]] shuttle flight took care of this problem.

===Changes in construction plans===

[[Image:STS-116 spacewalk 1.jpg|right|thumb|300px| Upgrading the International Space Station]] 

ISS construction is now far behind the original planned schedule for completion in 2004 or 2005. This is mainly due to the halting of all NASA Shuttle flights following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] in early 2003 (although there had been prior delays due partly to Shuttle problems, and partly to delays stemming from the Russian space agency's budget constraints). During the shuttle stand-down, construction of the ISS was halted and the science conducted aboard was limited due to the crew size of two.

As of the beginning of 2006, many changes have been made to the originally planned ISS, even before the Columbia disaster.  Modules and other structures have been canceled or replaced and the number of Shuttle flights to the ISS has been reduced from previously planned numbers. Still, the newest ISS Shuttle launch manifest and the current ISS design scheme reveal that more than 80% of the hardware planned to be part of the ISS in the late 90s, is still planned to be orbited to the ISS by its scheduled completion date in 2010.

In March 2006, a meeting of the heads of the five participating space agencies accepted the new ISS construction schedule that plans to complete the ISS by 2010.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 3 March 2006 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/03/03/Navigation/177/205237/NASA+commits+to+Shuttle+missions+to+International+Space.html flightglobal.com | title = NASA commits to Shuttle missions to International Space Station | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = FlightGlobal | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> A crew of six is expected to be established in 2009, after the Shuttle's next 12 construction flights following the second [[Return to Flight]] mission [[STS-121]]. Requirements for stepping up the crew size include enhanced environmental support on the ISS, a second Soyuz permanently docked on the station to function as a second 'lifeboat', more frequent Progress flights to provide double the amount of consumables, more fuel for orbit raising maneuvers, and a sufficient supply line of experimental equipment.

===Current status===
After the successful completion of two Return to Flight missions, ISS assembly resumed with the launch of [[STS-115]] on [[September 9]], [[2006]]. On [[December 9]], [[2006]] [[STS-116]] lifted off for the second Space Shuttle assembly mission since the Columbia disaster.  It took with it the first Swedish astronaut, [[Christer Fuglesang]]. EVAs conducted by Fuglesang and other members of the STS-116 crew upgraded the electrical system of the space station.  Station power is now supplied for the first time from solar arrays attached to the permanent truss structure.

==Structures and design==
[[Image:ISSMockupHouston.JPG|thumb|right|250px|International Space Station [[mockup]] at [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]]]]

{{see also|ISS assembly sequence}}
The [[space station]] is located in [[orbit]] around the [[Earth]] at an altitude of approximately 360 [[kilometre|km]] (220 miles), a type of orbit usually termed [[low Earth orbit]] (the actual height varies over time by several kilometers due to [[atmospheric drag]] and re-boosts). It orbits Earth in a [[Orbital period|period]] of about 90 minutes (1 hr 30 mins); by November 2006 it had completed more than 45,500 orbits since launch of the [[Zarya|Zarya module]] on [[November 20]] [[1998]].

The ISS, when completed, will be essentially made of a set of communicating pressurized modules connected to a [[Integrated Truss Structure|truss]], on which are attached four large pairs of photovoltaic modules. The pressurized modules and the truss will be perpendicular: the truss spanning from [[starboard]] to [[Port (nautical)|port]] and the habitable zone extending on the [[aft]]-forward axis. Although during the construction the station [[Attitude control|attitude]] may vary, when all four photovoltaic modules are in their definitive position the aft-forward axis will be parallel to the velocity vector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/flash/iss_attitude.html|title=What are the ISS attitudes?|accessdate=2006-09-11|format=Flash|publisher=NASA|language=English}}</ref>

A total of 10 main pressurized modules ([[Zarya]], [[ISS Zvezda|Zvezda]], [[Destiny Laboratory Module|Destiny]], [[Unity Module]] -also called Node 1-, [[Node 2]], [[Node 3]], [[Columbus Laboratory Module|Columbus]], [[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibo]], [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module|MLM]] and the [[Russian Research Module|RM]]) are currently scheduled to be part of the ISS by its completion date in 2010.<ref name="launch manifest">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=NASA - Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=2006-07-15|language=English|publisher=NASA}}</ref> A number of smaller pressurized sections will be adjunct to them ([[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] spacecrafts (permanently 2 as lifeboats - 6 months rotations), [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] transporters (2 or more), the [[Joint Airlock|Quest]] and [[ISS docking compartment|Pirs]] Airlocks, as well as periodically the [[MPLM]], the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] and the [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]]).

=== Power supply ===
{{main|Electrical system of the International Space Station}}
The source of [[Electric power|electrical power]] for the ISS is the sun: light is converted into electricity through the use of [[solar panels]]. Before assembly flight 4A (shuttle mission [[STS-97]], [[November 30]], [[2000]]) the only power source was the Russian solar panels attached to the [[Zarya]] and [[Zvezda]] modules: the Russian segment of the station uses 28 [[volt]]s [[direct current|dc]] (like the [[Space Shuttle program|Shuttle]]). In the rest of the station, electricity is provided by the solar panels attached to the truss at a [[voltage]] ranging from 130 to 180 volts dc. The power is then stabilized and distributed at 160 volts dc and then converted to the user-required 124 volts dc. Power can be shared between the two segments of the station using converters, and this feature is essential since the cancellation of the Russian [[Science Power Platform]]: the Russian segment will depend on the U.S. built solar arrays for power supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/solar_arrays.htm|title=Boeing: Integrated Defense Systems - NASA Systems - International Space Station - Solar Power|accessdate=2006-06-05|publisher=Boeing|language=English}}</ref>

[[Image:Cycle.gif|thumb|left|250px|Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)]]
Using a [[High voltage|high-voltage]] (130 to 160 volts) distribution line in the so-called U.S. part of the station led to smaller power lines and thus weight savings.

=== Life support === 
The ISS [[Environmental Control and Life Support System]] provides or controls elements such as atmospheric pressure, oxygen levels, water, and fire extinguishing, among other things. The highest priority for the life support system is the ISS atmosphere, but the system also collects, processes, and stores water and waste used and produced by the crew. For example, the system recycles fluid from the sink, shower, urine, and condensation. [[Activated carbon|Activated charcoal]] filters are the primary method for removing byproducts of human metabolism from the air.

===Pressurized modules already launched===

[[Image:mplm_in_shuttle.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|[[March 10]] [[2001]] - The Leonardo [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] rests in [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'s payload bay during [[STS-102]].]]

Currently, the ISS consists of only four main pressurized modules; two Russian modules [[Zarya]] and [[ISS Zvezda|Zvezda]] and two US modules [[Destiny Laboratory Module|Destiny]] and [[Unity Module|Node 1]]. Zarya was the first module launched by a [[Proton rocket]] in November 1998, followed by a shuttle mission that connected Zarya with Node 1, the first of three node modules, 2 weeks after Zarya had been launched. This bare 2-module core of the ISS remained unmanned for the next one and a half years, until in July 2000 the Russian module Zvezda was added, allowing a minimum crew of two astronauts or cosmonauts to be  on the ISS permanently. 

Since 2000, the only main pressurized module delivered to the ISS was the [[Destiny Laboratory Module]] by [[STS-98]] in 2001. The US Lab was also the first science module delivered to the ISS, whereas Zarya provides electrical power, storage, propulsion, and guidance functions and [[ISS Zvezda|Zvezda]] provides living quarters, a life support system, a communication system, electrical power distribution, a data processing system, a flight control system, and a propulsion system. Node 1's primary function is to link different modules together, however fluids, environmental control and life support systems, electrical and data systems are also routed through Node 1 to supply work and living areas of the station.

Other pressurized sections of the current configuration of the ISS are the [[Joint Airlock|Quest Airlock]] and the [[ISS docking compartment|Pirs Airlock]]. Soyuz spacecraft and Progress spacecraft docked to the ISS also extend the pressurized volume. At least one Soyuz spacecraft has to stay docked permanently as a 'lifeboat' and is replaced every six months by a new Soyuz as part of crew rotation.  

Although not permanently docked with the ISS, a [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] (MPLM) forms part of the ISS during Shuttle missions that include the MPLM. The MPLM is attached to Node 1 and is used for resupply and logistics flights.

===Pressurized modules to be launched===
====Harmony (Node 2) &mdash; October 2007====
[[image:ISS_Node_2_module.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Node 2]]]]
As of March 2006, nearly all already built pressurized modules are planned to be launched by the Space Shuttle after return to flight with [[STS-121]] in July 2006. If the current Shuttle launch sequence is not disrupted materially, ''[[Harmony Module | Harmony]]'' (formerly known as Node 2), will be launched in the second half of 2007 by [[STS-120]]<ref>http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts120/index.html</ref>. ''Harmony'' was built by the [[Italian Space Agency]], however its ownership has already been transferred to NASA as part of a bartering agreement between NASA and ESA.<ref>The [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] module will be flown to the ISS by Shuttle in return for ESA manufacturing both ''Harmony'' and [[Node 3]] for NASA.</ref> ''Harmony'' will contain eight racks that provide air, electrical power, water and other systems essential to support life on the spacecraft and is scheduled to be the hub for the ''Columbus'' module and ''[[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibo]]''.

====Columbus Laboratory Module &mdash; December 2007====
[[image:ESA Columbus module.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Artist depiction of the [[Columbus Laboratory Module]]]]
The next Shuttle flight after Harmony is scheduled to bring the European module ''[[Columbus Laboratory Module|Columbus]]'' to the ISS by [[STS-122]](''Discovery''). ''Columbus'' will be the second module mainly dedicated to science on the ISS, including the [[Fluid Science Laboratory]] (FSL), the [[European Physiology Modules]] (EPM), the Biolab, the [[European Drawer Rack]] (EDR) and various storage racks.

====Japanese Experiment Module &mdash; 2008/2009====
[[Image:ISS Kibo module.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Japanese Experiment Module]], aka Kibō module]]
The [[Japanese Experiment Module]] (also known as JEM or ''Kibo'') is the next pressurized module on the schedule. It consists of two pressurized sections and one exposed facility. Three shuttle flights are needed to bring the ''Kibo'' laboratory into orbit. The pressurized sections are scheduled to fly in the second half of 2008 and in the first half of 2009. ''Kibo'' will be mounted on ''Harmony,'' on the opposite side to the ''Columbus'' module.

====Multipurpose Laboratory Module &mdash; 2009====
The Russian space agency has announced that the [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]] (MLM) is scheduled to be launched by a [[Proton rocket]] in 2009. The MLM is the main Russian science module, and, depending on its actual launch date, the third or fourth science module to be launched to the ISS. It will be equipped with an altitude control system that can be used as a backup by the ISS and will be docked onto the Zvezda docking port. The [[European Robotic Arm]] will be launched together with MLM, mated on its surface for a later deployment in space, according to an agreement signed in October 2005 between ESA and Roskosmos.

====Node 3 and Cupola &mdash; 2010====
[[Image:ISS_Cupola_module.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Cupola (ISS)|Cupola]]]]
[[Node 3]] is currently scheduled for the beginning of 2010 on the next to last Shuttle flight. Like ''Harmony,'' Node 3 was built in Italy by the [[Italian Space Agency]], but is owned by NASA. It will be used as a storage compartment as its original purpose to be a hub for the [[Habitation Module]] as well as the [[Crew Return Vehicle]], is no longer relevant - both items were cancelled in 2001. One of the curiosities of the ISS, the [[Cupola (ISS)|Cupola]] 'space window' is currently scheduled to be flown together with Node 3. ESA has finished construction and is storing the Cupola until its flight with Node 3.

====Docking Cargo Module &mdash; 2010 ====
NASA's ISS schedule did include one [[Russian Research Module]] (RM) as part of the ISS that would have been docked to ''Zarya'' and was rumoured to fly to the ISS at some point after 2010 on a Russian Proton rocket. Construction on this module had never begun, which cast doubt on its actual delivery to the ISS. Its replacement, the Russian [[Docking Cargo Module]], made from the already-built hull of the Science Power Module, is reported to be scheduled for launch onboard [[STS-131]] in 2010.[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5087] It will dock to the nadir Zarya port, just as was planned for the RM. It will be used mainly to store cargo, and also to preserve a docking port for Soyuz/ Progress after the arrival of Node 3.

===Unpressurised elements===
There is also a large unpressurised [[Integrated Truss Structure|truss]] system partially in place that will eventually support the prominent [[ISS Solar Arrays|solar arrays]], as well as external experiments like the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] and the [[Plasma Contactor Unit]] [http://space-power.grc.nasa.gov/ppo/projects/iss/plasmacontactor.html].

An addition to unpressurized experiment accommodations on ISS is being developed by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], called [[EXPRESS Logistics Carrier]], or ELC (formerly EXPRESS Pallet). "EXPRESS" stands for "Expedite the Processing of Experiments to the Space Station". Several ELC units will be installed on the exterior of ISS to provide a home for space science experiments. ELC units provide not just a berth for experiments, but also provide power, heat, and command & [[telemetry]] links to experiments.

===Cancelled elements===
* [[Centrifuge Accommodations Module]] - would have been attached to Node 2, now named Harmony
* [[Universal Docking Module]] - replaced by [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]]
* [[Docking and Stowage Module]] - replaced by [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]]
* [[Habitation Module]] <ref>With the cancellation of the Habitations Module, sleeping places are now spread throughout the station. There will be three in the Russian segment once the ISS is completed and three in the US segment. It is however not necessary to have a separate 'bunk' in space at all, many visitors just strap their sleeping bag to the wall of a module, get into it and sleep.</ref>
* [[Crew Return Vehicle|Crew Return Vehicle (CRV)]]
* [[Interim Control Module]] - no need to replace [[ISS Zvezda|Zvezda]] (in storage ready to launch at short notice if required)
* [[ISS Propulsion Module]] - no need to replace [[ISS Zvezda|Zvezda]]
* [[Science Power Platform]] - power will be provided to the Russian segments partly by the US solar cell platforms
* [[Russian Research Module]] - Replaced by [[Docking Cargo Module]] (DCM)

==Current assembled components==
{{seealso | ISS assembly sequence}}
Building the ISS requires more than 40 assembly flights. Of these flights, currently 33 are planned to be Space Shuttle flights, with 20 ISS-shuttle flights currently flown and 13 more planned between 2007 and 2010. Other assembly flights consist of modules lifted by the Russian [[Proton rocket]] or in the case of the [[ISS docking compartment|Pirs Airlock]] by a [[Soyuz launch vehicle|Soyuz]] rocket.

In addition to the assembly and utilization flights, approximately 30 [[Progress spacecraft]] flights are required to provide logistics until 2010. Experimental equipment, fuel and consumables are and will be delivered by all vehicles visiting the ISS: the Shuttle, the Russian Progress, the European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] (prospectively from May 2007 onwards) and the Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]]. 

When assembly is complete, the ISS will have a pressurized volume of approximately 1,000 cubic meters, a mass of approximately 400,000 kilograms, approximately 100 kilowatts of power output, a truss 108.4 meters long, modules 74 meters long, and a crew of six.

As of December 2006 the station consists of several modules and elements:

==Legal aspects==
===Agreement===
[[image:ISS Agreements hi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover page of the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement signed on January 28, 1998]]

The legal structure that regulates the space station is multi-layered. The primary layer establishing obligations and rights between the ISS partners is the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA), an international treaty signed on [[January 28]] [[1998]] by fifteen governments involved in the Space Station project:  the ISS consists of the United States, Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, and eleven Member States of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). Article 1 outlines its purpose:

''This Agreement is a long term international co-operative framework on the basis of genuine partnership, for the detailed design, development, operation, and utilisation of a permanently inhabited civil Space Station for peaceful purposes, in accordance with international law''.<ref name = "legal framework">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 20 July 2001 | url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAH7O0VMOC_iss_0.html | title = International Space Station Legal Framework | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = European Space Agency | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

The IGA sets the stage for a second layer of agreements between the partners referred to as 'Memoranda of Understanding' (MOUs), of which four exist between NASA and each of the four other partners. There are no MOUs between ESA, Roskosmos, CSA and JAXA due to the fact that NASA is the designated ''manager'' of the ISS. The MOUs are used to describe the roles and responsibilities of the partners in more detail.

A third layer consists of bartered contractual agreements or the trading of the partners' rights and duties, including the 2005 commercial framework agreement between NASA and [[Roskosmos]] that sets forth the terms and conditions under which NASA purchases seats on Soyuz crew transporters and cargo capacity on unmanned [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] transporters.

A fourth legal layer of agreements implements and supplements the four MOUs further. Notably among them is the ISS code of conduct, setting out [[criminal jurisdiction]], anti-harassment and certain other behavior rules for ISS crewmembers.<ref>{{cite web | last = Farand | first = Andre | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://portal.unesco.org/shs/en/file_download.php/785db0eec4e0cdfc43e1923624154cccFarand.pdf| title = Astronauts’ behaviour onboard the International Space Station: regulatory framework | format = pdf | work = International Space Station | publisher = UNESCO | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

===Utilization===
[[Image:Helms.window.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The nadir window in the Destiny lab]]
[[Image:Interior of Zarya ISS mudule.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Zarya module]]

There is a fixed percentage of ownership for the whole space station. Rather Article 5 of the IGA sets forth that ''each partner shall retain jurisdiction and control over the elements it registers and over personnel in or on the Space Station who are its nationals''.<ref name = "legal framework"/> Therefore, for each ISS module only one partner retains sole ownership. Still, the agreements to use the space station facilities are more complex.

The three planned Russian segments [[Zvezda]], the [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]] and the [[Russian Research Module]]s are made and owned by Russia which, as of today, also retains its current and prospective usage ([[Zarya]], although constructed and launched by Russia, has been paid for and is officially owned by NASA). In order to use the Russian parts of the station, the partners use bilateral agreements (third and fourth layer of the above outlined legal structure). The rest of the station, (the U.S., the European and Japanese pressurized modules as well as the truss and solar panel structure and the two robotic arms) has been agreed to be utilized as follows (% refers to time that each structure may be used by each partner): 

# [[Columbus Laboratory Module|Columbus]]: 51% for ESA, 49% for NASA and [[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]] (CSA has agreed with NASA to use 2.3% of all non-Russian ISS structure) 
# [[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibo]]: 51% for [[JAXA]], 49% for NASA and CSA (2.3%)
# [[Destiny Laboratory Module|Destiny Lab]]: 100% for NASA and CSA (2.3%) as well as 100% of the truss payload accommodation
# Crew time and power from the solar panel structure, as well as rights to purchase supporting services (upload/download and communication services) 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA and 2.3% for CSA

==Costs==
The most cited figure of an estimate of overall costs of the ISS is 100 billion (very often cited as [[United States dollar|USD]]; ESA, the only agency actually stating potential overall costs on its website, estimates [[Euro|€]]100 billion<ref name = "costs"/>). Giving a precise cost estimate for the ISS is, however, not straightforward; it is, for instance, hard to determine which costs should actually be contributed to the ISS program or how the Russian contribution should be measured, as the Russian space agency runs at considerably lower USD costs than the other partners.

===NASA===
====Overview====
[[Image:Nasabudget.gif|thumb|right|250px|NASA's budget projections currently see an end to ISS funding in 2017 in order to free funds for the [[Vision for Space Exploration]]]]
The overall majority of costs for NASA are incurred by flight operations and expenses for the overall management of the ISS. Costs for initially building the U.S. portion of the ISS modules and external structure on the ground and construction in space as well as crew and supply flights to the ISS do account for far less than the general operating costs ''(see [[#2005 ISS budget allocation|annual budget allocation below]])''. 

NASA does not include the basic Space Shuttle program costs in the expenses incurred for the ISS program, despite the fact that the Space Shuttle has been nearly exclusively used for ISS construction and supply flights since December 1998. 

NASA's 2007 budget request lists costs for the ISS (without Shuttle costs) as $25.6 billion for the years 1994 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/about/budget/index.html | title = NASA 2007 Budget and 2006 Strategic Plan | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = NASA | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> For each of 2005 and 2006 about $1.7 to 1.8 billion are allocated to the ISS program. The annual expenses will increase until 2010 when they will reach $2.3 billion and should then stay at the same level, however inflation-adjusted, until 2016, the defined end of the program. NASA has allocated between $300 and 500 million for program shutdown costs in 2017.

====2005 ISS budget allocation====
[[Image:STS-114 Steve Robinson on Canadarm2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|NASA allocates about 125 million US dollars annually to EVAs]]
The $1.8 billion expensed in 2005 consisted of:<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/55411main_28%20ISS.pdf | title = International Space Station Major Events FY 2005 | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = NASA | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>
*'''Development of new hardware''': $70 million were allocated to core development, for instance development of systems like navigation, data support or environmental.
*'''Spacecraft Operations''': $800 million consisting of $125 million for each of software, extravehicular activity systems, and logistics and maintenance. An additional $150 million is spent on flight, avionics and crew systems. The rest of $250 million goes to overall ISS management.
*'''Launch and Mission operations''': Although the Shuttle launch costs are not considered part of the ISS budget, mission and mission integration ($300 million), medical support ($25 million) and Shuttle launch site processing ($125 million) is within the ISS budget.
*'''Operations Program Integration''': $350 million was spent on maintaining and sustaining U.S. flight and ground hardware and software to ensure integrity of the ISS design and the continuous, safe operability.
*'''ISS cargo/crew''': $140 million was spent for purchase of supplies, cargo and crew capability for Progress and Soyuz flights.

====Shuttle costs as part of ISS costs====
[[Image:Upgrading Hubble during SM1-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The only non-ISS related Shuttle flight between 2006 and 2010 will be a [[Hubble Space Telescope]] servicing mission in 2008]]
Only costs for mission and mission integration and launch site processing for the 33 ISS-related Shuttle flights are included in NASA's ISS program costs. Basic costs of the Shuttle program are, as mentioned above, not considered part of the overall ISS costs by NASA, because the Shuttle program is considered an independent program aside from the ISS. Since December 1998 the Shuttle has however been used nearly exclusively for ISS flights (since the first ISS flight in December 1998 until December 2006 only 5 flights out of 25 flights have not been to the ISS and only the planned [[Hubble Space Telescope]] servicing mission (see [[STS-125]]) in 2008 will not be ISS-related out of 14 planned missions until the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2010). 

Shuttle program costs during ISS operations from 1999 to 2005 (disregarding the first ISS flight in December 1998) have amounted to approximately $24 billion (1999: $3,028.0 million, 2000: $3,011.2 million, 2001: $3,125.7 million, 2002: $3,278.8 million, 2003: $3,252.8 million, 2004: $3,945.0 million, 2005: $4,319.2 million). In order to derive the ISS-related costs, expenses for non-ISS flights need to be subtracted, which amount to 20% of the total or about $5 billion. For the years 2006-2011 NASA projects another $20.5 billion in Space Shuttle program costs (2006: $4,777.5 million, 2007: $4,056.7 million, 2008: $4,087.3 million, 2009: $3,794.8 million, 2010: $3,651.1 million and 2011: $146.7 million). If the Hubble servicing mission is excluded from those costs, ISS-related costs will be approximately $19 billion for Shuttle flights from 2006 until 2011. In total, ISS-related Space Shuttle program costs will therefore be approximately $38 billion.

====Overall ISS costs for NASA==== 
Assuming NASA's projections of average costs of $2.5 billion from 2011 to 2016 and the end of spending money on the ISS in 2017 (about $300-500 million) after shutdown in 2016 are correct, the overall ISS project costs for NASA from the announcement of the program in 1993 to its end will be about $53 billion (25.6 billion for the years 1994-2005 and about 27 to 28 billion for the years 2006-2017).

There have also been considerable costs for designing Space Station Freedom in the 1980s and early 1990s, before the ISS program started in 1993. Plans of Space Station Freedom were reused for the International Space Station. 

To sum up, although the actual costs NASA views as connected to the ISS are only half of the $100 billion figure often cited in the media, if combined with basic program costs for the Shuttle and the design of the ISS' precursor project Space Station Freedom, the costs reach $100 billion for NASA alone.

===ESA===
ESA calculates that its contribution over the 30 year lifetime of the project will be €8 billion.<ref> [http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAQHA0VMOC_iss_0.html ESA: ISS Human Spaceflight and Exploration] </ref> The costs for the Columbus Laboratory total more than €1 billion already, costs for [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] development total several hundred million and considering that each [[Ariane 5]] launch costs around €150 million, each ATV launch will incur considerable costs as well. In addition ESA has constructed a [[ground control station]] in the South of Germany in order to control the Columbus Laboratory.

===JAXA===
The development of the Kibo Laboratory, JAXA's main contribution to the ISS, has cost about 325 billion yen (about $2.8 billion)<ref>[http://www.cnes-tv.net/cnes_fr/cnesmag/cnesmag24_etranger.pdf Etranger World: Major Changes for Japan's space sector]</ref> In the year 2005, JAXA allocated about 40 billion yen (about 350 million USD) to the ISS program.<ref>[http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive04/budgetarch_090704.html Space News: Japan Seeking 13 Percent Budget Hike for Space Activities]</ref> The annual running costs for Kibo will total around $350 to 400 million. In addition JAXA has committed itself to develop and launch the HTV-Transporter, for which development costs total nearly $1 billion. In total, over the 24 year lifespan of the ISS program JAXA will contribute well over $10 billion to the ISS program.

===Roskosmos===
A considerable part of the [[Russian Space Agency]]'s budget is used for the ISS. Since 1998 there have been over two dozen Soyuz and Progress flights, the primary crew and cargo transporters since 2003. The question, how much Russia spends on the station, measured in [[United States dollar|USD]], is, however, not easy to answer. The two modules currently in orbit are derivatives of the [[Mir]] program and therefore development costs are much lower than for other modules; in addition, the exchange rate between ruble and USD is not adequately giving a real comparison to what the costs for Russia really are. 

The $20 million each [[Space tourism|space tourist]] has paid for an available seat on a Soyuz to the ISS is only offsetting a very small part of Russia's financial contribution to the ISS.

===CSA===
Canada, whose main contribution to the ISS is the [[Mobile Servicing System|Canadarm2]], estimates that through the last 20 years it has contributed about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1.4 billion to the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/iss/facts.asp |title= International Space Station facts and figures |accessdate=2007-01-28 |format= |work= }}</ref>

==Criticism==
[[Image:ISS_Centrifuge_Accommodations_Module.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ISS Centrifuge Accommodations Module built by JAXA for NASA, one of the most ambitious science modules, will not be part of the completed ISS]]

There are many critics of the ISS, especially with regard to the biggest partner, NASA. These critics view the project as a waste of both time and American tax money, inhibiting progress on more useful projects.  For instance, critics argue that the widely quoted estimate of US$100 billion lifetime cost could pay for dozens of [[robotic spacecraft]] missions, that it could be used for other space exploration, that it could be better spent on problems on Earth, or that it would be better not to spend the taxes.<ref>{{cite news |title=A waste of space |url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=262429&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__international_news/ |publisher= Mail & Guardian |accessdate=2007-01-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceprojects.com/iss/ |title=A "Station" in Space and NASA's Deceptions on Earth |accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

Some critics argue that very little serious [[Scientific method|scientific research]] was ever convincingly planned for the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN04/wn092404.html |title=SPACE STATION: MAYBE THEY COULD USE IT TO TEST MISSILE DEFENSE.  |accessdate=2007-01-28 |last=Park |first=Bob}}</ref> They note that actual research has been trivial even compared to low expectations, although the ISS has been in orbit since 1998 and occupied since 2000. They point out that the scientific merit of experiments conducted on the shuttle and on other space stations have been negligible compared to most other funded science in space or on the ground. Other critics suppose that the ISS could accommodate important research, and believe that the cancellation of ambitious science modules, such as the [[Centrifuge Accommodations Module]], are unwarranted. They say that the planned ISS structure meets few of the scientific objectives of the station proposed in the 1990s.

Two technical aspects of the ISS's design have been heavily criticized: 
# It requires too much maintenance, and in particular too much maintenance by risky, expensive [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]];<ref>[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/453/1 The trouble with space stations] [[Jeff Foust]], [[The Space Review]], [[12 September]] [[2005]]. Retrieved [[10 September]] [[2006]]. </ref>
# Its orbit is too highly inclined, meaning American launches need to carry more fuel.<ref Name=astrosociety>[http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/34/space2.html Up, Up, and Away] www.astrosociety.org. Retrieved [[10 September]] [[2006]]. </ref> 
In general, the most economical orbits to reach are equatorial orbits reached from equatorial launch sites, due to the rotation of the Earth.<ref Name=astrosociety/> The choice of the ISS's inclination arose from the political realities of the American desire to heavily involve Russia, as the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]] is at a high latitude. Russia's involvement, in turn, saved the space station from abandonment after [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|disintegrated]] in 2003.  

In response to some of these criticisms, advocates of manned space exploration say that criticism of the ISS project is short-sighted, and that manned space research and exploration have produced billions of dollars' worth of tangible benefits to people on Earth. By some estimates, the indirect economic return from spin-offs of [[human spaceflight|human space exploration]] has been many times the initial public investment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/economics.html |title=The Economic Impacts of the U.S. Space Program  |accessdate=2007-01-28 |author=Jerome Schnee |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> However, critics argue that these estimates ''assume'' rather than ''conclude'' a good ratio of return on NASA's spending.  Another study concluded that the NASA's rate of return from spinoffs is actually very low, except for aeronautics work that has led to aircraft sales.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/spp/eprint/jp_950525.htm NASA Technological Spinoff Fables] www.fas.org. Retrieved [[17 September]] [[2006]].</ref>

Critics also say that NASA is often casually credited with "spin-offs" (such as Velcro and portable computers) that were developed independently for other reasons.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Park |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Virtual Astronaut |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/4/park.htm |work= |publisher=The New Atlantis |date= |accessdate=2007-01-28 }}</ref>  NASA maintains a list of spinoffs from the construction of the ISS, as well as from work performed on the ISS.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ISSspin.html| title = International Space Station Spinoffs| accessdate = 2006-09-14| author = NASA Center for AeroSpace Information (CASI) | date = | year = | month = [[2005-21-05]]| format = HTML| publisher = NASA| language = English}}</ref>  However, NASA's official list is much narrower and more arcane than dramatic narratives of billions of dollars of spin offs.

It is therefore debatable whether the ISS, as distinct from the wider space program, will be a major contributor to society. Some advocates argue that apart from its scientific value (or lack thereof), it is an important example of international cooperation.<ref>[http://www.spacetoday.org/SpcStns/FirstAnnivOccupy.html International Space Station: Human Residency Third Anniversary] Space Today Online, 2003. Retrieved [[17 September]] [[2006]]. </ref> Others claim that the ISS is an asset that, if properly leveraged, could allow more economical manned Lunar and Mars missions.<ref>[http://www.marstoday.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18482  Interview with Niolai Sevostianov, President, RSC Energia: The mission to Mars is to be international] MarsToday.com, [[2005-12-11]]. Retrieved [[2007-01-16]].</ref> Either way, advocates argue that it misses the point to expect a hard financial return from the ISS; rather, it is intended as part of a general expansion of spaceflight capabilities.

==Expeditions==
{{see also|List of International Space Station Expeditions}}
All permanent station crews are named "Expedition N", where N is sequentially increased after each expedition. Expeditions (aka Increments) have an average duration of half a year.  

The International Space Station is the most-visited spacecraft in the history of space flight. As of [[September 11]], [[2006]], it has had 159 (non-distinct) visitors. [[Mir]] had 137 (non-distinct) visitors (See [[Space station#List of occupied space stations, with statistics|Space station]]). The number of distinct visitors of the ISS is 124 (see [[list of International Space Station visitors]]).

==Miscellaneous==
[[image:YuriMalenchenko.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Yuri Malenchenko]] was the first person to be married in space]]

===Space tourism and weddings===
As of 2007 there have been five [[Space tourism#List of flown spaceflight participants|space tourists]] to the ISS, each spending around US$25 million; they all went there aboard Russian supply missions. There has also been a space wedding when cosmonaut [[Yuri Malenchenko]] on the station married Ekaterina Dmitrieva, who was in Texas.

''[[Expedition 14#EVA 1|Golf Shot Around The World]]'' was an event in which, on an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]], a special golf ball, equipped with a tracking device, was hit from the station and sent into its own [[low Earth orbit]] for a fee paid by a Canadian golf equipment manufacturer to the Russian Space Agency. The task was supposed to be performed on [[Expedition 13]], but the event was postponed, and took place on [[Expedition 14]].<ref>http://www.e21golf.com/</ref><ref>http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1093</ref>

===Microgravity===
At the ISS altitude, the gravity from the Earth is still 88% of that at sea level. The state of [[weightlessness]] is a result of the fact that the ISS is in constant free fall, which according to the [[equivalence principle]] is indiscernible from being in a state where all forces, including gravity, are absent. However, due to (1) the drag resulting from the residual atmosphere, (2) vibratory acceleration due to mechanical systems and the crew on board the ISS, (3) orbital corrections by the on-board gyroscopes or thrusters, and (4) the spatial separation from the real [[Center of mass|centre of mass]] of the ISS, the environment on the station is often described as [[microgravity]], with a level of gravity on the order of 2 to 1000 millionths of ''g'' (the value varies with the frequency of the disturbance; the low value occurs at frequencies below 0.1 Hz, the higher value at frequencies of 100 Hz or more).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/downloads/userguides/physenv.pdf|title=European Users Guide to Low Gravity Platforms|accessdate=2006-05-16|format=PDF|publisher=European Space Agency|language=English}}</ref>

===Popular culture===
{{trivia}}
In ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', [[Captain (Star Trek)|Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko]] had a model of the International Space Station in his office on [[Deep Space Nine]]. The International Space Station also appeared in the opening credits of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''.

In ''[[Stargate SG1]]'', the International Space Station's orbit had to be shifted to avoid a collision with debris from a Goa'uld mothership destroyed in Earth's orbit during Anubis's attack at the end of season Seven, much to the irritation of the then Russian crew who thought if the United States made the mess, they should get around to cleaning it up. 

The International Space Station played a minor role in the 2004 movie, ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''.

In [[CBS]]'s [[Crime scene investigator|CSI]] show [[NUMB3RS]], the [[Fictional character|character]] [[Larry Fleinhardt]] leaves on a 6-month trip to the ISS.

In the novel [[World War Z]] by [[Max Brooks]] the ISS plays a role in keeping the satellites around the Earth in working order. The ex-crew member telling his account of the war talks about what the crew saw and witnessed far above the earth.

In the [[Playstation2]] videogame [[.hack//G.U.]] The ISS is referred to as "nearing completion" in a news clip found on the world news message board within the game. This is due to the storyline of the game occurring sometime in 2010.

In the movie [[Mission to Mars]], there is an ISS look-alike called the World Space Station, which additionally features a large ring-shaped component with [[artificial gravity]].
