'''Felipe Clemente de Diego y Gutiérrez''' (1866 - 1945) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] jurist who was instrumental in rebuilding the Spanish state and its judiciary after the [[Spain under Franco|Franquist]] victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

Clemente de Diego taught [[Roman law]] in [[Santiago]] in 1897–99 and [[civil law]] in [[Valladolid]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]] up until 1936. He co-founded the ''Revista de derecho privado'', later the most significant civil law journal in Spain, in 1913. In 1938, the Franquist regime named him president of the ''[[Tribunal Supremo]]'' (Supreme Court), which post he held up until his death.

The principal work of Clemente de Diego is the six-volume ''Curso elemental de Derecho civil español común y foral'' (1920-23). He also engaged in the study of the [[philosophy of law]], promoting the adherence to an ideal of [[natural law]] founded on [[Christianity|Christian]] ethics in the practice of law, and denouncing legal [[formalism]] as the reason for the perceived crisis of the legal system prior to the civil war.
