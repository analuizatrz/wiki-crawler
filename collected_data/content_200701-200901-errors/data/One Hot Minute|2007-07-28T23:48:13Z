'''''One Hot Minute''''' is the sixth album by the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released on [[September 12]], [[1995]]. It is the only album by the band recorded with [[Dave Navarro]], formerly of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Jane's Addiction]]. It is often regarded as the Chili Peppers' most alternative, experimental work.

The album fared well on the charts. It was crowned as double platinum and sold almost 2 million copies in the United States. However, this was considered a disappointment when compared to the much greater commercial success of the preceding ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', and the band's later three albums (''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'', ''[[By the Way]]'', ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'') after Frusciante returned. 'One Hot Minute' created a very unusual type of heavy/funk/psychedelic rock which was a totally uncommon style for the RHCP that was never duplicated.

==History==
Three years had elapsed between the release of the band's previous album ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' and their recording of the album, which began around late 1994 or early 1995. The previous guitarist of the band, John Frusciante, temporarily left the group mid-tour in the April 1992 (to return in 1998). After a string of replacements, the band settled on guitarist [[Dave Navarro]], formerly of [[Jane's Addiction]], in 1994. Navarro would depart from the Chili Peppers during the subsequent album tour to pursue other projects. 

In March 2006, the album was re-released via the [[iTunes Store]] including [[bonus track]]s. The original tracks, as with all the other re-released albums are not remastered, leaving only the bonus tracks remastered. One of these tracks, "Bob", had never been heard of/seen before. A fan asked Navarro about this song on his weblog 6767.com, he said the following: ''"Bob is a song about our friend and [[Thelonious Monster]] singer, Bob Forrest. It was the first song we did together. Why it never came out I am not sure."''

==Musical style==
Unlike the band's previous work, much of ''One Hot Minute'''s tracks are rooted in the [[heavy metal]] genre with added progressive and psychedelic influences, making heavy use of distorted, crunching guitar work (evident on such tracks as "[[Deep Kick]]" and "[[Coffee Shop (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Coffee Shop]]"). Flea's talent at playing the bass is showed constantly throughout the album with examples like: The two bass solos played in "Coffee Shop", the jazzy-feeling of the bass track played in "Walkabout", the wah-distorted, complicated, fast faced intro to "Shallow Be Thy Game", and the whole bassline to the song "Transcending". Also Smith's skill is not taken for granted with songs like "Warped", "Coffee Shop", "One Hot Minute", "Shallow Be Thy Game" and "Transcending".

''One Hot Minute'''s songs were on average far longer than on those on preceding albums by the Chili Peppers due to the added progressive influences on several of the songs. Tracks such as "[[Deep Kick]]", which begins with a slow pace and lengthy spoken-word poem, only to suddenly kick into a loud and energetic punk song, before once again descending pace for the melodic coda sung by Flea, and "One Big Mob", a track that begins in a heavy, fast-paced manner typical of the band's early period, but dramatically slows down for a drawn-out psychedelic bridge (complete with the sounds of a crying baby), then builds up to a crescendo before the first part of the song starts up again. Both over six minutes in duration, it is songs like these that are examples of the progressive approach taken by the band for ''One Hot Minute'' which Navarro may well have made a major contribution to. His previous band Jane's Addiction were known to compose progressive epics (e.g. "[[Three Days (song)|Three Days]]") as well songs of a conventional structure and length.

Other songs regress to the funk style of the Chili Peppers' earlier period, albeit with added influences from unlikely sources ("Walkabout" adopts an Australian theme, whilst "Falling Into Grace" contains tribal sounds.)  In "[[Pea (song)|Pea]]" bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] plays on his own with only acoustic bass and him singing about a "homophobic redneck dick" who had assaulted him. "[[Tearjerker]]" is a subdued ballad in which frontman [[Anthony Kiedis]] sings of the grief felt after learning about the death of [[Kurt Cobain]], whose band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] had previously toured with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Once again on "[[Transcending]]", which explores the band's reaction to the death of actor and close friend [[River Phoenix]].

Main singer and lyricist Anthony Kiedis was struggling with a [[heroin]] addiction throughout the recording of ''One Hot Minute''. As a result, the album's lyrics are often cryptic, bizarre and much darker in tone than any album the band have made before or since, moving away from the typical themes of sex and generally having a good time that dominated previous albums, and much more into the introspection that had already appeared on tracks like "[[Under the Bridge]]". The songs "[[Warped]]" and "[[Aeroplane (song)|Aeroplane]]" further tackle Kiedis' drug problems head on, often utilising some graphic, subvertedly menacing imagery, whilst the acoustic ballad "[[My Friends (song)|My Friends]]" appears to adopt a theme of depression and despair. These unusual music approaches create many difficult, inaccessible and commercially-unfriendly songs as a result, and this is further highlighted by the fact that the three songs above were released as the first three singles for the album, the latter two being the most successful. "My Friends" was the only track from ''One Hot Minute'' to be included on the band's ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation, although the [[music video]] for "Aeroplane" is also included on its accompanying DVD.
