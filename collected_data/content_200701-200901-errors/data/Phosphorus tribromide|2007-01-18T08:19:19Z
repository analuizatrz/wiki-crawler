'''Phosphorus tribromide''' is a colourless liquid with the formula [[Phosphorus|P]][[Bromine|Br]]<sub>3</sub>.  It fumes in air due to [[hydrolysis]] and has a penetrating odour.  It is widely used in the laboratory for the conversion of [[alcohol]]s to [[alkyl halide|alkyl bromide]]s.

== Chemical properties ==
Phosphorus tribromide, like [[Phosphorus trichloride|PCl<sub>3</sub>]] and [[Phosphorus trifluoride|PF<sub>3</sub>]], has both properties of a [[Lewis base]] and a [[Lewis acid]].  For example, with a Lewis acid such as [[boron tribromide]] it forms stable 1:1 adducts such as Br<sub>3</sub>B-PBr<sub>3</sub>.  At the same time PBr<sub>3</sub> can react as an [[electrophile]] or Lewis acid in many of its reactions, for example with amines.

The most important reaction of PBr<sub>3</sub> is with [[alcohols]], where it replaces an [[hydroxyl|OH]] group with a bromine atom to produce an [[Alkyl halide|alkyl bromide]]. Note that all three bromines can be transferred.
:PBr<sub>3</sub>  +  3 [[Alcohol|ROH]]  →  3 [[Alkyl halide|RBr]]  +  [[Phosphorous acid|HP(O)(OH)<sub>2</sub>]]

The mechanism (shown for a primary alcohol) involves initial activation of the alcohol oxygen by the electrophilic phosphorus (to form a good leaving group), followed by an [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution]] at the alcohol carbon.

[[Image:PBr3_alcohol_rxn.jpg|500px]]

Because of the S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution step, the reaction generally works well for [[Alcohol#Primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols|primary and secondary alcohol]]s, but fails for tertiary alcohols.  If the reacting carbon centre is [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]], the reaction usually occurs with [[Stereochemistry|inversion of configuration]] at the alcohol carbon, as is usual with an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.  

In a similar reaction, PBr<sub>3</sub> also converts [[carboxylic acid]]s to [[Acyl halide|acyl bromide]]s.
:PBr<sub>3</sub>  +  3 [[Carboxylic acid|RCOOH]]  →  3 [[Acyl halide|RCOBr]]  +  [[Phosphorous acid|HP(O)(OH)<sub>2</sub>]]

PBr<sub>3</sub> is a reasonably strong [[Redox|reducing agent]], and the oxidation of PBr<sub>3</sub> with [[oxygen]] gas is more vigorous than seen with PCl<sub>3</sub>.  It gives an explosive reaction that forms [[Phosphorus pentoxide|P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]] and [[bromine|Br<sub>2</sub>]].

== Preparation ==
PBr<sub>3</sub> is by treating [[phosphorus]] with [[bromine]], using PBr<sub>3</sub> itself as the solvent (white phosphorus is soluble in PBr<sub>3</sub>).  An excess of phosphorus is used in order to prevent formation of PBr<sub>5</sub>.
:[[Phosphorus|P<sub>4</sub>]]  +  6 [[Bromine|Br<sub>2</sub>]]  →  4 PBr<sub>3</sub>

==Uses==
The main use for phosphorus tribromide is for conversion of primary or secondary [[alcohol]]s to [[alkyl halide|alkyl bromide]]s<sup>[7]</sup>, as described [[#Chemical properties|above]]. PBr<sub>3</sub> usually gives higher yields than [[hydrobromic acid]], and it avoids problems of [[carbocation]] rearrangement- for example even [[neopentyl]] bromide can be made from the alcohol in 60% yield<sup>[6]</sup>.

Another use for PBr<sub>3</sub> is as a catalyst for the α-bromination of [[carboxylic acid]]s.  Although acyl bromides are rarely made in comparison with [[acyl chloride]]s, they are used as intermediates in [[Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation]] <sup>[8]</sup>.  Initially PBr<sub>3</sub> reacts with the carboxylic acid to form the acyl bromide, which is more reactive towards bromination.  The overall process can be represented as

On a commercial scale, phosphorus tribromide is used in the manufacture of [[pharmaceutical]]s such as [[alprazolam]], [[methohexital]] and [[fenoprofen]]. It is also a potent fire suppression agent marketed under the name [http://www.phostrex.com PhostrEx].

== Precautions ==
PBr<sub>3</sub> evolves corrosive HBr, is toxic, and reacts violently with water and alcohols.

In reactions that produce [[phosphorous acid]] as a by-product, when working up by distillation be aware that this can decompose above about 160 °C to give [[phosphine]] which can cause explosions in contact with air.<sup>[7]</sup>
