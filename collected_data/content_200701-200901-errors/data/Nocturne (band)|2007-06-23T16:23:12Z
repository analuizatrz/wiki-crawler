==Bio==
===Twilight===
Nocturne was originally picked up by Triple X records and Hollows Hill (the same label that signed on [[Jane's Addiction]]. "Twilight", Nocturnes debut CD, received hopelessly mixed reviews, most faulting its "groundlessly grim themes" in songs such as "A Happy Death." However, as a debut CD, the job was done, and a good fan base was formed following the new, up-and-coming band giving some room to grow. After its release, they spent a good deal of time touring with the likes of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Genitorturers]], [[Christian Death]], [[Godhead]], [[Switchblade Symphony]], [[Ohgr]], and even [[Marilyn Manson]] 
===Welcome To Paradise===
After heavy touring in support of Twilight, Nocturnes second album, "Welcome to Paradise," was released in an effort to win more fans over effectively popularized them, making them one of the more popular bands in Texas for quite sometime. The band emphasized this success with another bout of heavy touring, as well as receiving a nomination for "Best Industrial Band" in the Dallas Observer. 
===Paradise Wasted===
In a breakaway move, Nocturne was signed onto [[Invisible Records]]/[[Undeground Records]]. One year later, "Paradise Wasted" was released. This CD was one of two "filler CDs" to bridge the gap between "Welcome to Paradise" and the long waited for "Guide to Extinction", Paradise Wasted was essentially Welcome To Paradise with a new cover, now remastered, with two new bonus songs added, "Whore", and "Digit." 
===Axis of Evil===
After another year, "Axis of Evil" was turned out in 2003, again, to pass the time for the band, working forward for its third album. Axis of Evil was more limited in its edition, now out of print and extremely hard to purchase. Axis was a remix album of Paradise Wasted. The entire CD consisted of only 13 songs, but included a grand total of five versions of "Whore" and two versions of "My Bitch."

===Guide to Extinction===
In another shift, closer to their roots, the band signed BACK with [Triple X Records]. The last CD finally was released in 2005, "Guide to Extinction," was aptly named, being released shortly after the breakup between Chris Telkes and Lacey Conner. Even under the emotional stress following this,the album was considered the best showcase of Nocturne, and features a variety of tracks that quietly hint at the past, the band did a few months of touring, and afterward, was "put on hold for an indefinite period of time." However, the band has been expected to play a few shows in 2007 as hinted at on their official myspace page.
===Other Appearances===
:*"Anthems of Rust and Decay:A Tribute to Marilyn Manson" (performing Get Your Gunn)
:*"Easy Listening" (performing Closer to Heaven)
:*"Dim View of the Future (Chris Telkes performing Emilys Humming Mix)
:*"The Broken Machine: A Tribute to Nine Inch Nails" (performing Kinda, I Want To)
===Beliefs===
Simply put, Nocturne believes in one thing. Equality, no matter race, gender, sexual orientation, or even species. Nocturne (and more appropriately, Lacey) was involved in animal rights from the get-go, and advertises the bands (and her own message) whenever given a moment, this belief was more prominently amplified in Guide to Extinction (whose motto was: I wage war on the masses/I exploit and kill animals/I destroy my own planet/I am human/I am you) and carried onward to Laceys next projects as a solo artist.
