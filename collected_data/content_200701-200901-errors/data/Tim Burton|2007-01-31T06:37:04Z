'''Timothy William Burton''' (born [[August 25]], [[1958]]) is an [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[United States|American]] [[film director]], writer and designer known for his off-beat and quirky style. Especially in his stop-motion animated films, he is known for the exaggerated style of his characters, which still retain their serious, humanlike characteristics. He first came to note directing the [[Warner Brothers]] film ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', which was followed by the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] success of ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' in 1989. Following which he continued to make blockbusters as well as smaller dramas that continue to study loneliness in a style influenced by [[Gothic fiction|Gothic fairy tales]].

==Early life==
Burton was born in [[Burbank, Los Angeles County, California|Burbank, California]], the first of two sons to Bill Burton and Jean Erickson. Burton described his childhood self as quirky, self-absorbed, and highly imaginative. He found home life and school difficult and he escaped the reality of everyday life by watching horror and low budget films, to which he would later pay tribute in his biography of Edward D. Wood, Jr. Another film figure of importance in Burton's childhood is [[Vincent Price]], whose filmography would deeply influence the upcoming director's career. 

Following high school, he won a Disney scholarship to attend the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in [[Valencia, California]]. He studied [[animation]] for three years and was then hired by the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Walt Disney Studios]] as an animator apprentice. Burton's job was to draw for ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]''. Burton was dissatisfied with the artistic direction of the movie. He later commented on the refusal of Disney to use his design for ''The Fox and the Hound'' because his designs made the characters, in opposition to Disney's desires, "look like roadkill." Burton was not happy during his Disney period, yet it was during this period that he wrote and drew the poem and illustrations that would be the basis for his celebrated ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''.

==Early career==
In 1982, Burton made his first short, ''[[Vincent (film)|Vincent]]'', a six-minute [[stop-motion]] film about a young boy who fantasizes that he is his (and Burton's) screen idol [[Vincent Price]], with Price himself providing narration. This was followed by the live-action short ''[[Frankenweenie]]'', starring [[Barret Oliver]], [[Daniel Stern]], and [[Shelley Duvall]] (an early supporter of Burton's work). Shot in black and white and inspired by [[James Whale]]'s [[Frankenstein]], ''Frankenweenie'' features a boy who reanimates his dog Sparky after he was hit by a car. Although the film won praise at film festivals, Disney was concerned that the film was too scary for children and, not knowing what to do with it, shelved the film (''Frankenweenie'' later received a video release in 1992).

Although Burton's work had yet to see wide release, he began to attract the attention of the film industry. Actor/producer [[Griffin Dunne]], approached Burton to direct ''[[After Hours]]'' (1985), a comedy about a bored word processor who survives a crazy night in [[SoHo]] that had already been passed over by [[Martin Scorsese]]. However, when financing for ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' fell through, Burton bowed out of the project out of respect for Scorsese.

Not long after, actor [[Paul Reubens]] saw ''Frankenweenie'' and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spinoff of his popular character [[Pee-wee Herman]], who had gained popularity with a successful stage show at the Roxy, which had been turned into an HBO special. The film, ''[[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), was made on a budget of $7 million and grossed more than $40 million at the box office. Burton, a fan of the eccentric musical group [[Oingo Boingo]], asked vocalist/songwriter [[Danny Elfman]] to provide the music for the film. Since then, Elfman has provided the score for all but one Burton film, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''.

After directing episodes for the revitalized TV series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and [[Shelley Duvall]]'s [[Faerie Tale Theatre]], Burton received his next big project. ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), a supernatural comedy about a young couple forced to cope with life after death, as well as a family of pretentious yuppies invading their treasured New England home. Starring Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and featuring Michael Keaton as the famously repulsive demon Betelgeuse, the film grossed about $80 million on a relatively low budget. The film also snagged a Best Makeup Design Oscar.

===''Batman''===
Burton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives and he received his first big budget film ''[[Batman (1989 movie)|Batman]]'' (1989). The mega-budget production, based in London, was plagued with problems. Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers, [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], but the most notable debacle involved casting. Burton wanted to cast [[Michael Keaton]] from his previous film as [[Batman]], despite Keaton's average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor. Although Burton won out in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent where Warner Bros. share price slumped. Burton claimed that he thought it was ridiculous to cast a bulked-up he-man as Batman, insisting that the Caped Crusader should be an ordinary (albeit fabulously wealthy) man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals. Burton cast [[Jack Nicholson]] as the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] ([[Tim Curry]] was his second choice) in a move that helped assuage fans' fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a superhero film. When the film opened in [[1989#June|June 1989]], it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and Batman became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing well over [[United States dollar|$]]400 million worldwide and $250 million in the U.S. alone (numbers not adjusted by inflation). The film proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of [[Superman]] for a grimmer look and characters with more psychological depth. The stylized gothic look of Gotham City ended up being adopted as the look of the city in the comic books.

==The 1990s==

[[Image:edwardscissorhandsposter.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' is widely regarded by fans as Burton's finest work]]

In [[1990]], Burton co-wrote (with [[Caroline Thompson]]) and directed ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', re-uniting with Winona Ryder from the "Beetlejuice" days. Johnny Depp, a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old fashioned inventor (played by [[Vincent Price]], in his last appearance on screen before his death). Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator. Set in suburbia (the film was shot in Florida), the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his own childhood in the suburb of Burbank. Price at one point said, "Tim is Edward." Johnny Depp has also made a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, ''Burton on Burton'', regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film. ''Edward'' is considered Burton´s best movie by a wide number of fans and critics. Following this collaboration with Burton, Depp went on to star in ''Ed Wood'', ''Sleepy Hollow'', ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', and as a voice actor in ''Corpse Bride''. 

===''Batman Returns''===
Although Warner Bros. had declined to make the more personal ''Scissorhands'' even after the success of ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', Burton finally agreed to direct a sequel on the condition that he would be granted total control. The result was ''[[Batman Returns]]'', which featured [[Michael Keaton]] returning as the Dark Knight, and a new triad of villains: [[Danny De Vito]] (as the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]), [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] (as [[Catwoman]]), and [[Christopher Walken]].  Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children. Audiences were even more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume. One critic described the film as "too many villains spoiled the Batman", highlighting Burton's decision to focus the storyline more on the villains instead of Batman (though this was also somewhat true of the previous film). The movie also polarized the fanbase. Some loved the darkness and quirkiness, while others felt it wasn´t true to the core elements of the source material. ''[[Batman Returns]]'' grossed $160 million in USA (number not adjusted by inflation), which, while still a big success, was much less than expected. Burton then went on to do preliminary work on the third installment in the franchise, ''[[Batman Forever]]''. [[Val Kilmer]] was cast as the title character,{after Michael Keaton turned down the offer to reprise his previous role after Burton's departure from the project} [[Chris O'Donnell]] was cast as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]],[[Jim Carrey]]  was cast as [[the Riddler]]{after [[Robin Williams]] turned down the part},[[Tommy Lee Jones]] was cast as [[Two-Face]],and [[Nicole Kidman]] was cast as love interest Dr. Chase Meridian. Warner Bros. ultimately threw out Burton after they realized the tone of the film was to be similar to ''Batman Returns''. Burton left the Batman franchise from this point on (though he returned as a producer for the [[Joel Schumacher]]–directed ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995), a movie which he said had a title "like a tattoo you get when you're on drugs").

===''The Nightmare Before Christmas''=== 
Next, Burton wrote and produced (but did not direct, due to schedule constraints) ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme. The film was directed by [[Henry Selick]] and written by [[Michael McDowell (author)|Michael McDowell]] and Caroline Thompson, based on Burton's original story, world and characters.  The film continues to have a wide cult following. Burton collaborated with Selick again for ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996), which Burton co-produced.

===''Ed Wood''===
His next film, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of [[Ed Wood, Jr.|Ed Wood Jr.]], a filmmaker sometimes called "the worst director of all time." Again starring Depp in the title role, the film is an homage to the low-budget sci-fi and horror films of Burton's childhood, and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity, culminating in Ed leaving the preview of his latest movie believing that he has succeeded in his goal to make great movies (though the real Ed Wood died a lonely alcoholic death, having never achieved success in his lifetime). Due to creative squabbles during the making of ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', [[Danny Elfman]] declined to score ''Ed Wood'', and the assignment went to [[Howard Shore]]. While a commercial failure at the time of its release, ''Ed Wood'' was well received by critics and has since gathered a considerable fanbase, as well as helped revive the public interest for the films of Ed Wood Jr.

===''Mars Attacks!''===
Elfman and Burton reunited for ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996). Based on a popular science fiction trading card series, the film was a hybrid of 1950's sci-fi flicks and 1970's all-star disaster flicks. It's an anarchic cacophony of clever satire and goofy mayhem. Coincidental timing made it an inadvertent spoof of blockbusters such as ''[[Independence Day (movie)|Independence Day]]'', made around the same time and released five months earlier. Although the film boasted an all-star cast, including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], and [[Rod Steiger]], among others, the film was panned by American critics and mostly ignored by domestic audiences. It was however more successful abroad, and it later managed to gather a domestic fan base from its TV runs and DVD release.{{fact}}

===''Sleepy Hollow''===
''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' released in the autumn of 1999, was a return to vintage Burton, with a supernatural setting, unique sets, and another offbeat performance by [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Ichabod Crane]], now a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of [[Washington Irving]]'s original tale. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles ([[Michael Gough]], [[Jeffrey Jones]] and [[Christopher Walken]], among others) and [[Christina Ricci]] was cast as Katrina van Tassel. Mostly well received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman's especially Gothic score, the film won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction, as well as two BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. A box office success, ''Sleepy Hollow'' was also a turning point for Burton. Along with change in his personal life (separation from Lisa Marie), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing a remake of ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''.

===''The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy: and Other Stories''===
His book ''[[The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy: and Other Stories]]'' was published in 1996. The collection of verse is about misfit children such as Oyster Boy, Match Girl, Stainboy (who used to have his own flash cartoon series on atomfilms.com), the Girl Who Turned into a Bed, and other such outcasts.

==The 2000s==
''Planet of the Apes'' was a commercial success, grossing $68 million in its opening weekend. It was however panned by critics and was widely considered as inferior to the original. The main criticism was that the movie went for a more watered down "popcorn" feel than the dark, cerebral and nihilistic tone of the 1968 film. The film was a significant departure from Burton's usual style, and there was much subsequent debate about whether the film was really Burton's, or if he was just a "hired gun" who did what he was asked. [http://www.answers.com/topic/tim-burton] Burton reportedly clashed with the studio during the whole making of the film, once going as far as abruptly leaving the set for the day. There were also many reports about last minute changes in the movie. Despite the commercial success of the movie and an ending that clearly suggested the possibility of a sequel, apparently there are no intentions from the studio or Burton to make another ''Apes'' movie.

Burton went on to direct ''[[Big Fish]]'' (2003) which received four [[Golden Globe]] nominations, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005) and ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005), for which he received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature Film]]. ''Charlie'' and ''Bride'' were Burton´s most critically-praised movies in years. ''Charlie'' was a huge box office success that made over 207 million domestically alone. Depp´s voice and mannerisms as the Factory´s owner [[Willy Wonka]] drew many comparisons to pop star [[Michael Jackson]], even though the actor claims his main inspiration came from hosts of old TV shows for children.

==Personal life==
In [[1989]], he married Lena Gieseke, a German artist. They divorced shortly after the filming of ''[[Batman Returns]]''. He was also engaged to [[Lisa Marie]] from [[1992]]-[[2001]]. He is currently engaged to [[Helena Bonham Carter]] (since 2001) and lives in London. They have a son, Billy-Ray Burton, born in October 2003.

Burton reportedly remains estranged from his brother Daniel and his mother. His father, a former minor league baseball player, died around 2001.{{fact}} <!-- Really, "AROUND 2001?" Can we be more vague? -->

==The future==
On June 13, 2006, Burton announced that he would be postponing his work on ''[[Believe It or Not (film)|Believe It or Not]]'' to concentrate on the [[Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd|film adaptation]] of Stephen Sondheim's ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''. Burton's regular, [[Johnny Depp]], has been signed on to play the murderous barber.

In February 2006, in an interview Tim debunked rumors of ''Beetlejuice 2'', ''Edward Scissorhands 2'', and ''The Nightmare Before Christmas 2''. In that same interview, he also expressed interest in an [[Edgar Allan Poe]] film in the near future. [http://www.cinematical.com/2006/02/17/burton-downs-beetlejuice-2-rumors/]

Tim directed and worked on a music video for [[The Killers (band)|The Killers]] entitled ''Bones''. The video featured computer graphics and skeletons.

''The Nightmare Before Christmas 3D'' came out on the 20th October 2006, in Real D and December 1st in all theaters in regular [[anaglyph]]. He will produce an animated feature film version of the short film [[9 (film)#Feature film|9]].

He is also possibly working on a film with [[Pixar]]. [http://upcomingpixar.blogspot.com/2006/10/pixar-ratatouille-ts3-and-tim-burton.html]
