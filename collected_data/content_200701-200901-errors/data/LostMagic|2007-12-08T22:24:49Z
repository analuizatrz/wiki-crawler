{{nihongo|'''''LOSTMAGIC'''''|ロストマジック|Rosuto Majikku|often spelled as "Lost Magic"}} is a [[real-time strategy]] game for the [[Nintendo DS]] system, although it was advertised as a combination of [[role-playing game]] and [[real-time strategy]]<ref>"One part RPG, one part RTS. Ubisoft's Wi-Fi ready game's coming next month." IGN. [[http://ds.ign.com/articles/697/697105p1.html]]. March 20, 2006</ref>. It is developed by [[Taito Corporation]] and supports the [[Nintendo WiFi Connection]].

== Gameplay ==
There are two primary elements to this [[real-time strategy]] game: the magic system, and the use of captured monsters as soldiers.  

===Magic===
Since mages, such as the one the player controls, cannot physically attack, the player must rely on magic. The player can launch a wide variety of magical spells by drawing runes on the DS's touch screen. Runes drawn more accurately result in more powerful spells. However, some runes are easier to draw than others, and drawing runes slowly may leave the player open to attacks. There are 18 different runes. The elements of magic that the player can use in LostMagic are: fire, water/ice, earth/rock, light, dark, and wind. 

====Magic Combination====
Not too far into the game the player will be able to fuse runes, one example being fusing Fire 2 (explosion) and water 1 (ice shot) to make an explosion of ice. However, the combination of Ice 1 followed by Fire 2 is a completely different spell. Around the end of the game the player can fuse 3 runes together, creating 5000 new combination possibilities; however, some of these fail to work. In all there are 396 different spells. When used in combination, typically the first rune determines the effect of the spell, and the other(s) determine its elemental type. For example, any Duo Rune (a Combo of two runes) starting with Fire 2 will be an explosion of some type. The variety of spells in LostMagic leads to a greater depth of gameplay.

===Monsters===
Most enemies can be captured with certain spells, and then brought out to fight for the player in later battles. There are a total of 62 monsters the player can collect. Player-controlled monsters fight with the same [[artificial intelligence]] as computer-controlled enemies.  The player can give movement commands by selecting one or a group of monsters with the stylus, but more specific controls are not possible. Ultimately, the monsters control themselves, since if they get too close to a monster they will automatically run towards it and attack. The monsters can be leveled up to a maximum of level 50. Their stats slowly increase as they level up. In addition, their stats can be further boosted by "buff-up" spells, as well as items.

===Items===

In addition to the stat boosting spells, there are a set of items the player can equip them with. The items work by boosting a stat by a percentage, rather than a fixed value. The player can also collect higher level versions of the items he already has. Lower level items tend to be found at the beginning of the game while higher level items tend to be found near the end of the game and are rarer than other items.

The items are as follows:

Dragon Scale: Boosts magic Defense

Wind Shield: Boosts attack speed

Demon Horn: Boosts attack power

Gale Shoes: Boosts speed

Iron Shield: Boosts physical defense

Angel Coat: Boosts evasion

Life Bracelet: Boosts HP

Hunter's Eye: Boosts accuracy

The same items can be found at higher levels. The highest level item is level 6 and you can only receive these at The Ultimate Dragon

== Story ==
The storyline of the game centers on a young mage named Isaac whose father Russell, has left Isaac in the possession of the Wand of Light, one of seven powerful wands which allows him to cast damaging, healing, and other spells, and also capture and control opposing monsters. Isaac got separated from his parents when he was little, and was raised by a forest witch in the arts of magic. Things start to change when Isaac meets a mysterious girl... who is she, and why are so many monsters popping up?

===Good/Bad path===

After escaping the Balance Temple for the second time, the Diva of the Twilight will ask Isaac to surrender his wand in exchange for Trista's life.  If he does, he will then make the Wand of Hope and proceed through the "Good path" of the game, earning Lost Magic from the other Sages.  If he refuses to give up his wand, Isaac will fall into the Diva's control and will have to defeat the other Sages in the "Bad path" of the game.  The path chosen, along with some other more minor choices, determines which of four endings are revealed at the conclusion.

===The True Ending===

To get the true ending you must give the Diva of the Twighlight the wand of
light when she takes Trista captive.  After you give her the wand the ending
you will get is based on your relationship with Trista in the form of points.
There is 1 scene in every chapter but the last where you can gain relationship
points with Trista.

After you defeat the Diva you will destroy the castle. Later you will
learn that Trista used her wind magic to save the Diva just in time and she
returns to normal.  Isaac's father returns home and all magic in the world
disappears along with the monsters and Leonard.

===The Good Ending===

The good ending works exactly like the True ending.  You must give the Diva of
the Twighlight the wand and it is then based on your relationship with Trista.
If you have 13 or less points by the end of the game you will be granted with
the Good ending.

After you defeat the Diva you will destroy the castle. Isaac's father
returns home and all magic in the world disappears along with the monsters
and Leonard. Unlike in the True ending, the Diva isn't saved.

===The Normal Ending===

The normal ending can only be obtained by keeping the wand of light and taking
the evil path.  You will then have to defeat all of the Sages ending with a
battle with Trista.  After the battle you will have the option to finish her
off or not.  To get the Normal ending you must choose not to kill Trista.
Choosing not to kill Trista will fetch you the lost magic of wind, a final
battle with the Diva of the Twighlight, and the normal ending.

After you defeat the Diva you will destroy the castle. All magic in the
world disappears along with the monsters.  Neither the Diva or your father are
saved in this ending.

===The Bad Ending===
The bad ending is the easiest way to complete the game.  First you must choose
to keep the wand for yourself then after the battle with Trista you must
choose to finish her off.  After you do so the game will end. (You will not
get the lost magic of wind)

After you kill Trista you meet up with the Diva in her castle.  At the end of
this scene the Diva kills Isaac, takes his wand, and becomes the new creator.

== Characters ==

Upon defeating him, the player is bestowed the Lost Magic of Darkness and Leonard then explains the Lost Magics.  Also, on the good path, Leonard will take you to meet his mother, who is in fact an Elder Dragon, and she will teach Isaac an ancient technique called the "trio rune," which, unlike the duo rune, will only let you make certain combinations instead of letting you make too many combinations.

<i>A rare little bird who understands human speech, he is friendly and easy to get along with. He also thinks that Isaac's head is a nest. </i>

== Multiplayer ==
Using multiplayer, players can fight against a friend or foe a short distance away.  The battle options include "Free Duel" using preset character settings, and "Duel" using the saved character data.  Actual duels will be saved, and are a fun way for players to gain experience points while learning of new spells from others.

== Wi-Fi ==
In [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], the player has the opportunity to fight using a preset character of Lvl 40, or their character and monsters from the Story Mode. Using the Story Mode, the character yields experience to level up your party for in Story Mode. Many reviews complain of lag in the online modes.

The [[WiFi]] battles consist of epic duels between two mages and each of the monsters that are selected before the match begins.

== Local Multiplayer ==
With Single-Card play, in which case only 1 person needs to own the game, the second player can only download a demo of the game.
With Multi-Card Play, players take their Story Mode teams and fight each other for experience to level up. People fought in Local Multi-Card Play are automatically added to each other's Wi-Fi Friend lists.
