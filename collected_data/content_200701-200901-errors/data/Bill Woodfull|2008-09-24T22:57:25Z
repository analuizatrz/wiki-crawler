'''William Maldon "Bill" Woodfull''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (22 August 1897 &mdash; 11 August 1965) was an Australian [[cricket]]er. He captained both [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] and [[Australian cricket team|Australia]], and was best known for his dignified and moral conduct during the tumultuous [[Bodyline]] series in 1932-33 which almost saw the end of Anglo-Australian cricketing ties. Trained as a schoolteacher, Woodfull was known for his benevolent attitude towards his players, and his patience and defensive technique as an opening batsman. After making his first-class debut in 1921, Woodfull rose to national selection in 1926. Touring England, he was named as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]]. He reluctantly became captain in 1930 when [[Jack Ryder]] was dropped, and regained the Ashes on the English tour of the same year. After ceding them to England in the Bodyline tour, Woodfull bade farewell to international cricket on the 1934 English tour when he became the only captain to regain the Ashes twice. 

== Style ==

Woodfull batted in a manner which had little aesthetic pleasure or grace, with [[Wisden]] describing stating that "at first sight, he gave the impression of being clumsy".<ref name="wisden"/> Affected by a bout of rheumatoid fever in childhood, he had stiff-jointed style, and played with little noticeable backlift. This gave the impression of a laboured playing style. Despite this, he scored consistently through good placement and powerful [[List of cricket terms#D|drives]] generated by his strong forearms.<ref name="wisden">{{cite web| title= Wisden 19279 - Bill Woodfull |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154706.html| year= 1962 |accessdate=2007-05-24| publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref> He was known for playing with a straight bat and a close watch on the ball, which were the core features of a strong defensive ability, which yielded names such as "the unbowlable" (a reference to the fact that he was rarely [[bowled]] as a result of missing the ball) and "wormkiller".<Ref name="az"/> He was also known for his reliability in crisis match situations, leading to epithets such as "The Rock" and "Old Steadfast".<Ref name="az"/> Woodfull formed an opening partnership with [[Bill Ponsford]] at state and international level which yielded 18 century opening stands. Dubbed "Mutt and Jeff" by team-mates after a famous [[vaudeville]] act,<Ref name="az"/> they were regarded as one of the finest opening partnerships in Test history. As a captain, Woodfull was known for his courage and high moral principles in the face of the Bodyline series. Fellow player [[Stan McCabe]] described him as "the greatest man I ever met".<ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =pp. 322&ndash;323}}</ref><ref name="pollard">{{cite book | last = Pollard |first= Jack | year = 1969 | title = Cricket the Australian Way| pages=p. 182}}</ref>

== Early years ==
Born in the central Victorian town of [[Maldon]], Woodfull's family moved to [[Melbourne]] when his father Thomas, a [[Methodist]] preacher, was given a transfer to [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], an inner city suburb. Woodfull's father installed a net in the backyard and taught him the emphasis on defensive technique and patience which were to become his hallmark.<ref name="pyoung">Perry, pp. 146&ndash;147.</ref> Woodfull attended [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]] and his early career was unremarkable. He made his district cricket debut in 1916 for [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], at the age of 19, but did not distinguish himself. He played no further cricket at the level before he gained his qualification as a schoolteacher in 1919. He was posted to Maryborough High School, and it was in the rural cricket competition that he began to gain attention. In 1920 and 1921, he accumulated 1335 runs at average of 225.83 in the local competition. 
[[Image:Melbourne High School 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Melbourne High School, with the Woodfull-[[Keith Miller|Miller]] oval in the foreground]]
When the [[England cricket team]] toured Australia in 1920&ndash;21, Woodfull played for a [[Ballarat]] XV, and scored a 50 and 1. A teaching transfer in 1921 saw him return to Melbourne, where the Victorian selectors trialled him in Second XI fixtures. In two matches against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] and [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]], he registered unbeaten scores of 186 and 227 respectively. In early 1922, he made his Sheffield Shield debut against South Australia at the [[Adelaide Oval]], and in his second match against [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]], registered his maiden first-class century with 153.<ref name="az"/><ref name="wisden"/> During this time, he also studied for an arts degree at night in addition to his post at Williamstown High School.<ref name="pyoung"/> Between 1922 and 1926, he accumulated over 3000 runs at an average of 67. He solidified his position in the Victorian Sheffield Shield team in the 1922&ndash;23 season, when he averaged 85, including a 117 against New South Wales. He averaged 74 in 1924&ndash;25, when his best effort was 97 and 236 in a match against South Australia. In a match against New South Wales in the same season, he compiled 81 and 120 not out as Victoria managed to win after their opponents had accumulated 614 in the first innings. At this stage in his career, he was primarily a middle order batsman, opening only occasionally.<ref name="az"/><ref name="wisden"/>

== Test debut ==
[[Image:Woodfull stance.jpg|left|200px|Woodfull's batting stance|thumb]]
As a result of consistent performances for Victoria, Woodfull was selected for [[Herbie Collins]]' Australian Test team for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1926|1926 Ashes tour]]. He headed the batting averages in the first-class matches and was third in the Tests. In his first two innings on tour, he struck a 201 against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] at [[Leyton]] and a 118 at [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]]. They were the first of eight centuries during the tour, in which he compiled 1809 runs at 58.35.<Ref name="az"/><Ref name="wisden"/><ref name="cricinfo"/> He made his debut in the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]], but Australia did not bat in a washed-out match.<ref name="testlist"/><ref name="auslist"/> and failed to make an impression in the Second Test at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]], scoring 13 and a duck.<ref name="testlist"/> He established himself as a Test opener in the Third Test at [[Headingley cricket ground|Headingley]]. After opening partner [[Warren Bardsley]] was dismissed without scoring in the first over, Woodfull put on a second wicket partnership of 235 with [[Charles Macartney]] to register his maiden Test century of 141. He followed this in the Fourth Test at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] with 117, the highest score of the innings.<ref name="az"/><ref name="wisden"/><ref name="cricinfo"> {{cite web|title= Players and Officials:Bill Woodfull |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/8246.html| first=Gideon |last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| accessdate=2007-05-24|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> The first four Tests were drawn, so the fate of the Ashes depended on the Fifth Test.<Ref name="auslist"/> Woodfull could manage only 35 and a duck as Australia lost the Test and the Ashes.<ref name="testlist"/> His 206 runs at 51.50 in the Tests placed him third behind Bardsley and Macartney.<ref>Perry, p. 147.</ref>

Upon his return to Australia, he established his partnership with Ponsford, and in the 1926&ndash;27 Shield season, they put on a 375-run opening stand which laid the foundation for the world record first-class score of 1107 against New South Wales. In 1927&ndash;28 Woodfull recorded his career best score of 284, during a brief tour to [[New Zealand]] as part of an Australian XI.<ref name="az"/>

Woodfull was appointed as vice-captain to [[Jack Ryder]] for the 1928&ndash;29 home Ashes series.<ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 56.</ref> He played his first Test on Australian soil with at [[Brisbane]] in the First Test. He made a duck in the first innings,<ref name="testlist"/> before Australia were forced to chase 742 for victory. Woodfull carried his bat to make an unbeaten 30 as Australia were skittled for 66 on a sticky wicket in [[Brisbane]] in the First Test to lose by 675 runs.<ref name="az"/><ref name="cricinfo"/><ref name="p28-30"/> Woodfull then made 68 in the first innings of the Second Test in [[Sydney]] before scoring his first Test century in Australia, with 111 in the second innings. Despite this, England won the match by eight wickets. The Third Test was Woodfull's first at his home ground in Melbourne, and despite scoring 107 in the second innings, the tourists won by three wickets.<Ref name="az"/><ref name="auslist"/> Woodfull made only one and 30 as Australia fell short by 12 runs in the Fourth Test, but ended the series on a high. The teams returned to Melbourne for the Fifth Test, where Woodfull scored 102 and 35 in front of his home crowd as Australia won by five wickets. It was the first time that Woodfull had played in a winning Test,<Ref name="testlist"/><ref name="auslist"/> He hit three centuries in the series, with 491 runs at 54.56 despite which Australia lost the Ashes 4&ndash;1.<ref name="p28-30"/> He also managed 275 not out for Victoria during a tour match against the Englishmen, his highest score for his state.<ref name="az"/><ref name="cricinfo"/><ref name="p28-30"/> During this match, Woodfull had agreed with English captain [[Percy Chapman]] to vary rules that had been laid by the Australian Board of Control. The two men agreed to cover the pitch throughout the match and to bowl overs of six balls instead of eight. The Australian Board of Control reacted by reprimanding the [[Victorian Cricket Association]].<ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 57.</ref>

His 1929&ndash;30 Australian season was cut short when he suffered a broken hand after being hit by a short ball from [[Hugh Thurlow]].<ref name="az"/><ref name="cricinfo"/><ref name="p28-30"/>

After the heavy defeat in the previous Ashes series, captain and fellow Victorian [[Jack Ryder]] was omitted altogether from the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|1930 Ashes tour]], and Woodfull appointed captain. Ryder was one of the three selectors, but his two colleagues had voted him off.<ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 58.</ref> At first, Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job, feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder. When he was informed that Ryder was not even touring, he only agreed after a ballot was organised. After winning, Woodfull led the youngest fifteen-man squad to ever tour England, with eleven never having played on English soil. Commentators expected Australia to be easily defeated, being described as "the weakest squad ever to come to these shores."<ref name="p28-30"/> The tour started with a match against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]], with Woodfull scoring a century and previously obscure young batsman by the name of [[Don Bradman]] making 236* in 275 minutes.<Ref name="p28-30"/> 

Woodfull had a poor captaincy debut in the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]], scoring two and four as Australia fell to a 93-run defeat.<ref name="auslist"/><ref name="testlist"/><ref name="p28-30"/> He set the tone with an opening stand of 162 with fellow Victorian Ponsford in the Second Test at Lord's. He then maded a 231 run stand with Bradman (254) and reached 155. He was unbeaten on 26 in the second innings as Australia completed a seven-wicket triumph. He contributed 50 to a stand of 192 with Bradman in the Third Test at Headingley (the match in which Bradman scored 309 in a day), but rain helped England to a draw after being forced to follow on.<ref name="testlist"/><ref name="p28-30"/> Woodfull scored 54 as the Fourth Test was rained out before the second innings,<Ref name="testlist"/> and scored another 54 as Australia amassed 695 to win the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] by an innings and regain the Ashes 2&ndash;1.<ref name="testlist"/> Woodfull had contributed 345 runs at 57.50, second only to Bradman.<ref name="p28-30"/> In all first-class matches, he compiled 1435 runs at 57.36 including six centuries as Australia recovered the Ashes. Woodfull and his fellow Victorian Ponsford played a significant part by making three century opening stands&mdash;162 at Lord's, 159 at The Oval and 106 at Old Trafford to help Australia take the initiative.<ref name="az"/><ref name="cricinfo"/> Upon returning to Australia, Woodfull was elected as Victoria's delegate on the five-man national selection panel, replacing Ryder.<ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 60.</ref> However, he resigned from the role before the next international series, thereby never participating in the selection of a Test team.<Ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 62.</ref>

This was followed by home series against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 1930&ndash;31, the first Test tour of Australia by the Caribbean side.<ref name="auslist"/> Ponsford unselfishly broke up his opening combination with Ponsford by dropping down to No. 6 to accommodate young batsman [[Archie Jackson]]. Woodfull was uncomfortable batting out of position,<Ref name="p28-30"/> scoring six, 58 and 17 in the first three Tests.<ref name="auslist"/> Woodfull batted only once in each Test, as Australia won the First Test by ten wickets, and the next two by an innings.<ref name="auslist"/> Woodfull was restored to the top of the order for the Fourth Test in Melbourne after Jackson's illness became too much. He struck 83 as Australia took a third consecutive innings victory. However, the winning run came to an end with a 30-run loss in the Fifth Test, with Woodfull scoring 22 and 18.<ref name="auslist"/><ref name="testlist"/> He ended the series with a modest 204 runs at 34.00 as Australia won 4&ndash;1.<ref name="p28-30"/> 

The following season saw a tour to Australia by the [[South African cricket team|South Africans]]. Woodfull scored 74 and 58 as Australia took innings victories in the first two Tests. In the Third Test in Melbourne, after scoring seven in the first innings, he compiled his Test best of 161 in the second innings to help set up a 169-run win. It was the second successive Test season in which Woodfull had saved his highest Test score of the series for his home crowd.<Ref name="auslist"/><ref name="testlist"/> He continued his run with 82 and 37 not out in the Fourth Test, which was won by ten wickets. He finished the season with a duck in the Fifth Test, but Australia won by an innings anyway.<ref name="auslist"/><Ref name="testlist"/>

Woodfull opened for the entire series, and returned his best ever series figures of 421 at 70.17, second only to Bradman.<ref name="az"/><ref name="cricinfo"/><ref name="p28-30"/> The 5&ndash;0 result remains the only time that Australia has clean-swept South Africa over five Tests.<ref name="auslist"/>

=== Bodyline ===
{{main|Bodyline}}
In 1932&ndash;33, the English team led by Douglas Jardine won the Ashes in a very acrimonious series. Their ''[[Bodyline]]'' tactics, which involved bowling at the bodies of the Australian batsmen and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended away from the upper body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. During the season, Woodfull's physical courage and dignified leadership won him many admirers. He refused to employ retaliatory tactics even though his men were repeatedly hit.<ref name="az"/> 

Australia lost heavily by ten wickets in the First Test at Sydney, when the bowling spearhead of Bodyline, [[Harold Larwood]], took ten wickets,<ref name="pollard"/> while Woodfull managed only seven and a duck.<ref name="testlist"/> Before the Second Test, Woodfull had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Reilly |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill O'Reilly (cricketer) |year=1985 |title= Tiger - 60 Years of Cricket'' |publisher=[[HarperCollins|Collins]] |isbn=0-00-217477-4 |pages= p. 88}}</ref> This caused the toss to be delayed and fomented speculation that the Australian Board of Control were considering the possibility of removing Woodfull because of his absolute refusal to allow his bowlers to use retaliatory tactics.<Ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 72.</ref> Although Woodfull led Australia to a dramatic victory by 111 runs, his form was a problem as managed only 10 and 26.<ref name="cricinfo"/><Ref name="testlist"/><ref name="auslist"/> 

The controversy reached its peak during the second day of the Third Test. An all-time record [[Adelaide Oval]] crowd of 50,962<ref>{{cite book |last=Harte |first=Chris |year=1993 |title=A History of Australian Cricket |publisher=[[Andre Deutsch]] |isbn=0-233-98825-4 |pages=346}}</ref><Ref name="h73">Haigh and Fingleton, p. 73.</ref> watched Australia finish off England's first innings for 341. Then, Woodfull opened Australia's batting with [[Jack Fingleton]], who was dismissed straight away for a duck. Minutes later Larwood, bowling to a conventional field setting, struck Woodfull an agonising blow under his heart with a short, lifting delivery.<ref>Frith, p. 179.</ref> As Woodfull bent down over his bat in pain for several minutes, the huge crowd began jeering and hooting. Jardine reacted by saying "Well bowled, Harold".<Ref name="h73"/> When play resumed, England's Gubby Allen bowled an entire over to Bradman.<ref>Frith, p. 180.</ref> As Larwood prepared to bowl his next over to Woodfull, Jardine changed to the ''Bodyline'' field setting. The capacity Saturday afternoon crowd viewed this as hitting a man when he was down.<ref name="h73"/> Journalist-cricketer Dick Whitington, wrote that Jardine's actions were seen as "an unforgivable crime in Australian eyes and certainly no part of cricket".<ref name="whit"/> Mass hooting and jeering came after almost every ball.<ref name="h73"/><Ref name="whit"/> Whitington noted that "[Umpire] Hele believes that had what followed occurred in Melbourne the crowd would have leapt the fence and belaboured the English captain; Larwood, and possibly the entire side".<ref name="whit">{{cite book |last=Whitington |first=Dick |year=1974 |title=The Book of Australian Test Cricket 1877&ndash;1974 |publisher=[[Wren Publishing]] |isbn=0-85885-197-0 |pages=p. 173}}</ref>

During the over, another rising delivery knocked the bat out of Woodfull's hands. He battled it out for 89 minutes, collecting more bruises before Allen bowled him for 22.<ref>Frith, p. 182.</ref> Later in the day, the English team manager [[Pelham Warner]] visited the Australian dressing room to express his sympathies to Woodfull. Woodfull had remained calm in public, refusing to complain about Jardine's tactics.<ref name="h73"/> Woodfull's abrupt response was meant to be private, but it was leaked to the press and became the most famous quotation of this tumultuous period in cricket history:<ref name="az"/>

{{quote|I do not want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is playing cricket and the other is not.<ref name="az"/><Ref name="h73"/>}}

Australian wicketkeeper Bert Oldfield was struck a severe blow to the head while batting on the third day of the match. Woodfull came onto the ground to help him back to the dressing room.<Ref name="f2168"/> As a result of the injuries, the costs of insurance cover for players doubled.<ref>Frith and Haigh, p. 77.</ref> During the fifth day's play the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control for International Cricket]]<ref name="f2168">Frith, pp. 216&ndash;218.</ref> sent the following cable to the MCC in London:

{{quote|Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace the best interests of the game, making protection of the body by the batsman the main consideration. This is causing intensely bitter feeling between the players, as well as injury. In our opinion it is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once it is likely to upset the friendly relations existing between Australia and England.<Ref name="p258">Pollard, p. 258.</ref><ref name=f218">Frith, p. 218.</ref>}}

Jardine threatened to withdraw his team from the Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC backed their captain but offered to abandon the tour. The standoff was settled only when [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Joseph Lyons]] warned the Australian Board of the severe economic hardships that could result if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the Fourth Test, thus saving the tour.<ref>Frith, pp. 255&ndash;259.</ref>

[[Image:Woodfull&Richardson.jpg|left|thumb|Woodfull (left) walks out to open the batting with Vic Richardson in the final Bodyline Test.]]
In the second innings at Adelaide, England set Australia 532 for victory, which if successful, would have been a new Test record victorious run chase. Even today, the highest successful run chase is 418.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Australia lost its first wicket at three when [[Jack Fingleton]] was [[bowled]] by Larwood. Woodfull was joined by Bradman, who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method, before being dismissed for 66. Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73, carrying his bat as his teammates capitulated around him. Australia was eventually all out for 193, with [[Bert Oldfield]] unable to bat due to a fractured skull.<ref name="pbody">Perry, pp. 144&ndash;146.</ref> 

Woodfull made scores of 67, 19, 14 and 67 in the final two Tests, which Australia lost by six and eight wickets respectively;<ref name="testlist"/><ref name="auslist">{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru - Australia - Tests - Results list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> In the Fifth Test in Sydney, Larwood broke a bone in his foot, but Jardine made him complete the over. Larwood stood stationary at the wicket and bowled without a run-up, but Woodfull, the true sportsman, refused to take advantage of the injured bowler and blocked the remaining deliveries back down the wicket.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

England reclaimed the Ashes 4&ndash;1.<ref name="az"/> Overall, he had scored 305 runs at a moderate 33.89 average&mdash;but significantly, he had defied the English bowling for over twenty hours in total, more than any other Australian. Eventually, rule changes were made to effectively outlaw the tactic by 1934.<ref name="pbody"/>

In 1934, having been reappointed to a position on the selection panel,<Ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 80.</ref> he led Australia back to England on a tour, which had been under a cloud after the cricket diplomacy of the previous Bodyline series. After agreements were put in place so that ''Bodyline'' would not be used. However, in a match against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]], [[Bill Voce]], one of the ''Bodyline'' bowlers of 1932&ndash;33, used it with the wicket-keeper standing down the leg side. Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that if it were repeated, his men would leave the field and return to London. The following day, Voce was absent with a "leg strain".<Ref name="p28-30"/><Ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 85.</ref> 

Woodfull performed poorly in the Tests, with 228 runs at 28.50, but it was sufficient for an Australian triumph as Bradman and Ponsford each averaged over 90 and [[Clarrie Grimmett]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] each taking over 25 wickets. During his captaincy he was criticised for his relatively defensive strategy, tending to bat opponents out of the match instead of going for victory.<ref name="p28-30"/> Following Bodyline, he heavily relied on O'Reilly and Grimmett, using only three specialist bowlers as he sought to reinforce the batting line up.<ref name="p28-30"/> This made Woodfull the only captain to twice regain the Ashes. He scored 1268 runs at 52.83 during the tour with three centuries. Upon retiring immediately after he was awarded a joint testimonial with Ponsford on his return to Victoria.<ref name="az"/> In early 1935, Woodull lost his position as the Victorian delegate on the national selection panel after being defeated by [[William Johnson]] in a vote.<Ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 91.</ref>

== Retirement ==
Outside cricket, Woodfull had a successful career as a mathematics teacher and headmaster at his ''[[alma mater]] '' Melbourne High School.<ref name="az"/> One of his students was future Australian Test [[all rounder]] and [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] [[Keith Miller]], whom he taught in year nine.<ref name="Coleman">{{cite book

 }}</ref> Miller was a mediocre student, as he did little study and focused his energy on sport.<Ref name="p18">Perry (2005), p. 18.</ref> This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school motto, which meant ''Honour the Work'' and exhorted his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="p18"/> Miller scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class,<Ref name="p21">Perry (2005), p. 21.</ref> and was forced to repeat the year.<ref name="p22">Perry (2005), p. 22.</ref> Despite his credentials, Woodfull refused to involve himself in coaching the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills,<ref name="p19">Perry (2005), p. 19.</ref> writing in the school magazine that "Miller has Test possibilities".<ref name="p25">Perry (2005), p. 25.</ref> 

<!--He always considered his contributions to education more important than anything he ever did on the cricket field. One of his pupils was [[Keith Miller]], and the school oval was later named the Miller-Woodfull Oval.{{Fact}}--> 

The rejuvenated Maldon Oval in his home town was renamed the Bill Woodfull Recreation Reserve, and when the Great Southern Stand was constructed at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in 1992, one of the entrances was named the Bill Woodfull Gate.<ref name="az"/>

Woodfull married Gwen King, who he met while singing in the choir at his father's church in [[albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], and they married after Woodfull's return from the England tour in 1926. They had three children.<ref name="p28-30">Perry, pp. 147&ndash;148</ref>

In <!--1934 he turned down the offer of a [[knighthood]] for services to cricket,{{Fact}} but in--> 1963 accepted an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to education.<ref name="az"/> In 1965, he collapsed and died while playing golf in [[Tweed Heads]], [[New South Wales]].<ref name="cricinfo"/> Woodfull was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001.<ref name="cricinfo"/>
