'''Adrian Malcolm Conan Doyle''' ([[November 19]], [[1910]] - [[June 3]], [[1970]]) was the youngest son of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Adrian Doyle was described as a race-car driver, big-game hunter, explorer, and writer. Lycett <ref> ''The Man who created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle'' by Andrew Lycett, page 464 (2007, Weidenfield & Nicolson, London & Viking, New York) ISBN 0-7432-7523-3 </ref> calls him a "spendthrift playboy" who (with his brother Denis) "used the Conan Doyle estate as a milch-cow".   

He was born in [[Crowborough]], [[England]] and died in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. He married Anna Andersen from Denmark. He was his father's [[literary executor]] after his mother died in 1940, and founded the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Foundation in Switzerland in 1965. On his death, his sister [[Jean Conan Doyle|Dame Jean Conan Doyle]] took over as their father's literary executor. 

==Additional Sherlock Holmes stories==
Either alone or with the assistance of [[John Dickson Carr]], Adrian Doyle produced additional [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.  The basis of his production was to complete the tales referenced in his father's stories, but which his father had never written.  These Sherlock Holmes tales were written in 1952 and 1953, but have been republished subsequently. In 1954 a hard cover collection of the stories was published, ''[[The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes]]''. [[List of authors of new Sherlock Holmes stories|Other authors]] have also written Sherlock Holmes stories based on the same references within the original tales.  

==Discovery of unpublished Holmes story==
On September 12, 1942, the [[Associated Press]] announced that an authentic, unpublished Sherlock Holmes story had been found by Adrian Conan Doyle. Written in his father's uniquely neat handwriting, the story was buried in a chest that contained family documents.  Adrian Conan Doyle refused to publish it. A month later, the [[Baker Street Irregulars]] wrote a letter to the [[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]], insisting that the story be published. In the United States, ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine obtained it and published it in their August 1948 issue under the uncharacteristic title ''The Case of the Man who was Wanted''. It was also published in [[London]]'s ''Sunday Dispatch'' magazine the following January. Sherlockian [[Vincent Starrett]] doubted that the story was written by the elder Doyle and suggested that Adrian was the author. In September 1945, a letter was received by [[Hesketh Pearson]], a biographer of Arthur Conan Doyle. The letter stated, "My pride is not unduly hurt by your remark that 'The Man who was Wanted' is certainly not up to scratch for the sting is much mitigated by your going on to remark that it carries the authentic trade&ndash;mark! This, I feel, is a great compliment to my one and only effort at plagiarism." The letter was written by an [[architect]] named Arthur Whitaker. He had sent the story to Arthur Conan Doyle in 1911 with a suggestion that they publish it as a joint collaboration. Doyle refused, but sent Whitaker a check for £10 in payment for the story. Whitaker retained a carbon copy. After seeing it attributed in the ''Sunday Dispatch'' to Arthur Conan Doyle, Whitaker wrote a letter to Denis Conan Doyle explaining the true authorship. Denis forwarded the letter to his brother Adrian, who became angry, demanded proof, and threatened legal action. In 1949, the Doyles admitted, after seeing the carbon copy and listening to people who had read it in 1911, that Whitaker was the author. The story, which was thought by many people to be the work of Arthur Conan Doyle, has been published recently in the collection ''The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes''. <ref>Published as "The Adventure of the Sheffield Banker" in ''The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes''.</ref>

==Works about his father== 
Sir Arthur's widow Jean chose a spiritualist the Rev. John Lamond to write an authorised life of him, ''Arthur Conan Doyle: A Memoir'' (John Murray, 1931). The memoir emphasized his paranormal interests but was not what readers wanted, so after their mother's death Adrian and Denis grudgingly allowed [[Hesketh Pearson]] to write ''Conan Doyle: His Life and Art'' (Methuen, 1943). But Pearson's book offended Adrian and Denis by saying that the secret of Arthur Conan Doyle's success was that he was the "common man". Adrian threatened criminal proceedings against Pearson's "fakeography", and wrote an article in protest, and later a book ''The True Conan Doyle'' (John Murray, 1945).  

<!-- In 1946, Adrian Conan Doyle wrote an article in protest against a biography of his father by [[Hesketh Pearson]], who he said had never met Sir Arthur. This article was later published in book form by Coward-McCann, Inc. New York, N. Y. Did he say that Pearson had never met their father? (timings do not tie in with year of "The True Conan Doyle") -->
Later "When the BBC commissioned an anniversary talk from Hesketh Pearson, Adrian announced that if it went ahead it would never broadcast another Sherlock Holmes story. The Corporation cravenly caved in." <ref> ''The Man who created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle'' by Andrew Lycett, page 464-466 (2007, Weidenfield & Nicolson, London & Viking, New York) ISBN 0-7432-7523-3 </ref> Lycett also says that Pearson had met Arthur at his relation Francis Galton's place before the First World War. Pearson had idolised him from an early age, but was disappointed to find a thick-set broad-faced man with no more mystery than a pumpkin, who fulminated against Sherlock Holmes for preventing him from writing the historical novels he wanted.
