'''Dorset''' (pronounced 'DOR-sit' or [dɔ.sət], and sometimes in the past called '''Dorset[[shire]]'''), is a [[Counties of England|county]] in [[South West England|South West]] [[England]] on the [[English Channel]] coast. The [[county town]] is [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], situated in the south of the county at {{coor dms|50|43|00|N|02|26|00|W|}}. Between its extreme points Dorset measures 50 [[mile]]s (80 [[kilometre|km]]) from east to west and 40 miles (64 km) north to south, and has an area of 1,024 [[square miles]] (2,653 [[square kilometre|km²]]). Dorset borders [[Devon]] to the west, [[Somerset]] to the north-west, [[Wiltshire]] to the north-east, and [[Hampshire]] to the east. Around half of the Dorset's population lives in the [[South East Dorset conurbation]]. The rest of the county is largely rural with a relatively low population density. Dorset's motto is 'Who's Afear'd'.

Dorset is famous for its beautiful coastline, the [[Jurassic Coast]], which features landforms such as [[Lulworth Cove]], the [[Isle of Portland]], [[Chesil Beach]] and [[Durdle Door]], as well as the holiday resorts of [[Bournemouth]], [[Poole]], [[Weymouth]], [[Swanage]], and [[Lyme Regis]]. Dorset is the setting of the novels of [[Thomas Hardy]], who was born near Dorchester. The county has a long history of human settlement and some notable archaeology, including the [[hill fort]]s of [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]] and [[Hod Hill]].

==History==
{{main|History of Dorset}}
The earliest recorded use of the name was in AD&nbsp;940 as '''Dorseteschire''', meaning the dwellers (''saete'') of 'Dornuuarana' (Dorchester), the place of fisticuffs ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: 'Dwrn', 'fist'; and 'gwarae', 'play').<ref>[http://www.gwp.enta.net/dorsarticle.htm Mapping the Dornsaete (Dorset) Domesday], [http://www.gwp.enta.net Historical Maps of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales] &ndash; verified [[2005-04-22]]</ref>

The first known settlement of Dorset was by [[Mesolithic]] hunters, from around 8000&nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]]. Their populations were small and concentrated along the coast in the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and [[Chesil Beach]] and along the [[River Stour, Dorset|Stour valley]]. These populations used tools and fire to clear these areas of some of the native [[Oak]] [[forest]]. Dorset's high chalk hills have provided a location for defensive settlements for millennia, with [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] burial mounds on almost every chalk hill in the county, and a number of [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s, the most famous being [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]]. The chalk downs would have been deforested in these times, making way for farmland.

Dorset has many notable [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] artefacts, particularly around the Roman town [[Dorchester]], where Maiden Castle was captured from the [[Celt]]ic [[Durotriges]] by [[Vespasian]] in 54 AD, early in the Roman occupation. Roman roads radiated from Dorchester, following the tops of the chalk ridges to the many small Roman villages around the county. In the Roman era, settlements moved from the hill tops to the valleys, and the hilltops had been abandoned by the 4th century. A large defensive ditch, [[Bokerley Dyke]], delayed the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] conquest of Dorset from the north east for up to two hundred years. The [[Domesday Book]] documents many Saxon settlements corresponding to modern towns and villages, mostly in the valleys. There have been few changes to the parishes since the Domesday Book. Over the next few centuries the settlers established the pattern of farmland which prevailed into the 19th century, as well as many [[monasteries]], which were important landowners and centres of power.

In the 12th century [[civil war]], Dorset was fortified with the construction of the defensive castles at [[Corfe Castle]], [[Powerstock]], [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Shaftesbury]], and the strengthening of the [[monasteries]] such as at [[Abbotsbury]]. In the 17th century [[English Civil War]], Dorset had a number of [[Charles I of England|royalist]] strongholds, such as [[Sherborne Castle]] and [[Corfe Castle]], which were ruined by [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces in the war. In the intervening years, the county was used by the [[monarchy]] and [[nobility]] for hunting and the county still has a number of [[Deer Park]]s. Throughout the late [[Medieval]] times, the remaining hilltop settlements shrank further and disappeared. From the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] to [[Georgian era|Georgian]] periods, farms specialised and the monastic estates were broke up, leading to an increase in population and settlement size. During the [[industrial revolution]], Dorset remained largely rural and still retains its agricultural economy. The [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]] lived in Dorset, and the farming economy of Dorset was central in the formation of the [[trade union]] movement.

==Physical geography==
{{main|Geology of Dorset}}

Most of Dorset's landscape falls into two categories, determined by the underlying [[geology]]. There are a number of large ridges of [[limestone]] [[downland]], much of which have been cleared of the native [[forest]] and are mostly [[calcareous grassland|grassland]] and some [[arable land|arable]] agriculture. These limestone areas include a band of [[chalk]] which crosses the county from south-west to north-east incorporating [[Cranborne Chase]], the [[Dorset Downs]] and [[Purbeck Hills]]. Between the areas of downland are large, wide [[clay]] [[vale]]s (primarily [[Oxford Clay]] with some [[Weald Clay]] and [[London Clay]]) with wide [[flood plain]]s. These vales are primarily used for [[dairy]] agriculture, dotted with small villages, farms and [[coppice]]s. They include the [[Blackmore Vale]] ([[River Stour, Dorset|Stour valley]]) and [[River Frome, Dorset|Frome valley]].

South-east Dorset, around Poole and Bournemouth, lies on very nonresistant [[Eocene]] clays (mainly [[London Clay]] and [[Gault Clay]]), [[sand]]s and [[gravel]]s. These thin soils support a [[heathland]] habitat which supports all seven native British [[reptile]] species. The [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] [[estuary]] runs through this weak rock, and its many [[tributary|tributaries]] have carved out a wide estuary. At the mouth of the estuary sand [[spit (landform)|spits]] have been deposited turning the estuary into [[Poole Harbour]], one of several worldwide which claim to be the second largest natural [[harbour]] in the world (after [[Sydney Harbour]], though Sydney's claim is disputed). The harbour is very shallow in places and contains a number of islands, notably [[Brownsea Island]], famous for its [[Red Squirrel]] sanctuary and as the birthplace of the [[Scouting]] movement. The harbour, and the chalk and limestone hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck|Purbeck]]s to the south, lie atop Britain's largest onshore [[oil field]]. The field, operated by [[BP]] from [[Wytch Farm]], produces a high-quality oil and boasts the world's oldest continuously pumping well ([[Kimmeridge]], since the early 1960s) and longest horizontal drill (5&nbsp;miles, ending underneath Bournemouth [[pier]]). The [[pottery]] produced by [[Poole Pottery]] from the local clays is famous for its quality.

Most of [[Jurassic Coast|Dorset's coastline]] was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2001 because of its geological [[landforms]].  The coast documents the entire [[Mesozoic]] era from [[Triassic]] to [[Cretaceous]], and has yielded many important [[fossil]]s, including the first complete [[Ichthyosaur]] and fossilised Jurassic trees.
[[Image:durdledoor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Durdle Door]] [[natural arch]]]]

The coast also features examples of most notable coastal landforms, including a textbook example of [[cove]] ([[Lulworth Cove]]) and [[natural arch]] ([[Durdle Door]]). Jutting out into the [[English Channel]] is a limestone island, the [[Isle of Portland]], connected to the mainland by [[Chesil Beach]], a [[tombolo]]. One of the best ways to explore the Jurassic Coast is to follow the [[South West Coast Path]] National Trail that runs along it.

In the west of the county the chalk and clay of south-east England begins to give way to the [[marl]] and [[granite]] of neighbouring [[Devon]]. Until recently [[Pilsdon Pen]] at 909&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (277&nbsp;[[metre|m]]), was thought to be the highest hill in Dorset, but recent surveys have shown nearby [[Lewesdon Hill]] to be higher, at 279 m (915 ft). It is also a [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]].

The county has the highest proportion of 'Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty' (44% of the whole county), 'World Heritage Sites', and 'Sites of Special Scientific interest' in England.
[[Image:Lulworth Cove, Dorset-(Aerial).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Lulworth Cove]], a fine example of a [[cove]]]]

The county has warm summers and mild winters, being the third most southern county in the UK, but not westerly enough to be afflicted by the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] storms of [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]]. Dorset shares the greater winter warmth of the southwest (average 4.5 to 8.7 °C)<ref>Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/16.gif Winter average mean temperature for the United Kingdom].</ref>, whilst still maintaining higher summer temperatures than that of Devon and Cornwall (average highs of 19.1 to 22.2 °C)<ref>Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmax/14.gif Summer average maximum temperature for the United Kingdom].</ref>. The average annual [[temperature]] of the county is 9.8 to 12 °C (49.6 to 53.6 °F), with the exception of the highest areas of the downs.<ref>Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif Annual average temperature for the United Kingdom].</ref> In coastal areas around Dorset it is rare to have frosts, and it almost never snows. 

The county enjoys more sunshine than any other county, along with [[Hampshire]], [[Kent]] and [[East Sussex|East]] and [[West Sussex]], with all five counties receiving 1541&ndash;1885 hours.<ref>Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/ss/17.gif Annual average sunshine for the United Kingdom].</ref> Average annual rainfall varies across the county, with southern and eastern coastal areas recieving as little as 741 mm per year, whilst the Dorset Downs recieve between 1061 and 1290 mm per year - which is less than Devon and Cornwall to the west but more than counties to the east.<ref>Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/rr/17.gif Annual average rainfall for the United Kingdom].</ref>

==Demographics==
[[Image:poole.quay.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poole Quay]]

Dorset has a [[population]] of 407,217, plus 165,370 in [[Bournemouth]] and 137,562 in [[Poole]] (total 710,149 — mid-year estimates for 2006).  The following statistics exclude Poole and Bournemouth, which are no longer part of the administrative county.

91.3% of Dorset's population were born in [[England]] and 95.2% were born within the [[United Kingdom]].  98.8% are indigenous, an extreme example of the disproportionately small [[ethnic minority]] population in rural areas.

78% of the population are [[Christian]], 13.7% are not religious.

Dorset has the second highest proportion of elderly people of any county in Britain, second only to [[East Sussex]], with 25.9% of the population over 65 and 13.9% of the 16&ndash;74 age range retired. The county has the lowest [[birth rate]] of the 34 English counties, at 9.6 births per 1000. It has the third highest mortality rate, behind East Sussex and [[Devon]]. In 1996 deaths exceeded births by 1,056, giving a natural population decline of 2.7 per 1000, however, in 1997 there were 7,200 migrants moving to Dorset and the [[South East Dorset conurbation|Poole-Bournemouth conurbation]], giving Dorset the second highest net population-growth, behind [[Cambridgeshire]], at 17.3%.<ref>[http://www1.dorsetcc.gov.uk/LIVING/FACTS/Census2001.nsf Office for National Statistics, 2001 census data] &ndash; verified [[2005-04-22]]</ref><ref>[http://www1.dorsetcc.gov.uk/Living/Facts/DorsetDataOnLine.nsf/-/A48DF589F0FD530E0025678B005CBBE3?OpenDocument Dorset County Council Facts & Figures] &ndash; verified [[2005-04-22]]</ref>

==Politics==
Dorset County Council is based at County Hall in Dorchester. Following the local council elections in May 2005, 24 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], 16 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], four [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and one independent councillor sit on the county council. All Labour councillors were elected in the built up area of [[Weymouth and Portland]], with rural areas returning Conservatives and Liberal Democrat councillors.

This pattern is repeated at the national level. [[South Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|South Dorset]] is represented in Parliament by Labour MP [[Jim Knight]], though this constituency was Labour's smallest majority and was one of the most fiercely contested seats in the General Election of 2005. In the event, the seat went against the national trend and Mr Knight's majority increased slightly on a swing from the Conservatives. In all other Dorset constituencies, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are the most successful parties: [[Mid Dorset and North Poole (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid-Dorset and North Poole]] is represented by the Liberal Democrats, and [[West Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|West Dorset]], [[Christchurch (UK Parliament constituency)|Christchurch]] and [[North Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|North Dorset]] by the Conservatives.

The built up area of Poole and Bournemouth is divided into three constituencies, [[Bournemouth East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth East]], [[Bournemouth West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth West]] and [[Poole (UK Parliament constituency)|Poole]], all of which are currently represented by Conservative MPs.

==Economy and industry==
[[Image:Abbotsbury, Dorset - Tithe_Barn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Abbotsbury Great Barn]]

In 2003 the [[gross value added]] (GVA) for the county was £4,673 million, with an additional £4,705 million for Poole and Bournemouth.<ref>Office for National Statistics, 2003. [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/RegionalGVA.pdf Regional Gross Value Added] (pp.240-253)</ref>  4% of GVA was produced by [[primary industry]], 26% from [[secondary industry]] and 70% from [[tertiary industry]].  The average GVA for the 12 statistics regions of South West England was £6,257 million. Using 2004 population estimates, the GVA per person was £6,671 for Dorset, £15,683 for Poole and Bournemouth, £15,235 for the South West and £16,100 for the UK.

The principal industry in Dorset was once agriculture. It has not, however, been the largest employer for many decades as [[mechanisation]] has substantially reduced the number of workers required. Agriculture has become less profitable and the industry has declined further. Between 1995 and 2003 GVA for primary industry (largely agriculture with some fishing and quarrying) declined from £229 to 188 million&mdash;7.1% to 4.0% of the county's GVA. In 2002, 1,903&nbsp;km² of the county was in agricultural use, down from 1,986&nbsp;km² in 1989, although the figure has fluctuated somewhat. [[Cattle]], the principal animal stock in the county, fell from 240,413 to 178,328 in the same period, the [[dairy]] herds falling from 102,589 to 73,476. [[Sheep]] and [[pig]] farming has declined in a similar fashion.

West Dorset General Hospitals [[NHS Trust]] employs around 2,500 multidisciplinary staff, with the majority at the 500-bed [[Dorset County Hospital]] which provides a turnover of £76 million.<ref>[http://www.dch.org.uk/Jobs/JOBdocuments/TRUSTPROFILE.pdf West Dorset General Hospitals NHS Trust]</ref>. This new hospital was a bigger replacement for the now closed [[Dorchester Hospital]]

One of Dorset's famous products is the Dorset Knob, a hard biscuit. It can be used as an accompaniment to [[cheese]], especially the local Dorset cheese, [[Dorset Blue Vinney cheese|Blue Vinney]].

[[Tourism]] has grown as an industry in Dorset since the early 19th century. 4.2 million British tourists and 260,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2002, spending a combined total of [[Pound Sterling|£]]768 million. Foreign tourism declined in 1999 (310,000, down from 410,000 in 1998), and again in 2002 (down from 320,000), the latter decline being blamed on the effects of the global economy and security.

Dorset has little manufacturing industry, at 14.6% of employment (compared to 18.8% for the UK), and is ranked 30th out the 34 English counties. The [[gross domestic product]] for the county is 84% that of the national average.

Dorset will host the only Olympic event at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] held outside London – [[sailing]] – at the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]] in [[Portland Harbour]]. [[Weymouth Bay|Weymouth and Portland's waters]] have been credited by the [[Royal Yachting Association]] as amongst the best in Northern [[Europe]].<ref name="wpnsa">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/London2012/home.asp?svid=14 | title = 2012 Olympic Games sailing venue | format = | work = | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref>

==Culture==
[[Image:Dorset ca mh.jpeg|thumb|right|Cerne Abbas Manor House]]
As a largely rural county, Dorset has fewer major cultural institutions than larger or more densely population areas.  Major venues for concerts and theatre include Poole Borough Council's Lighthouse arts centre, Bournemouth Borough's [[Bournemouth International Centre|BIC]] and Pavillion Theatre, Wimborne's Tivoli Theatre, and the Pavillion in Weymouth.  Dorset's most famous cultural institution is perhaps the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]], founded in 1893 and now one of the country's most celebrated orchestras.  Dorset is not especially famous in sport, though [[football (soccer)|football]] league one [[A.F.C. Bournemouth]], and minor [[county cricket]] club [[Dorset County Cricket Club|Dorset CCC]] play in the county.  The county is notable for its watersports, however, which take advantage of the sheltered waters of Weymouth and Poole bays, and Poole and Portland Harbours.

Dorset is famed in [[literature]] for being the native county of [[author]] and [[poet]] [[Thomas Hardy]], and many of the places he describes in his novels in the fictional [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Wessex]] are in Dorset. The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] owns [[Thomas Hardy's Cottage]], in woodland east of Dorchester, and [[Max Gate]], his former house in Dorchester.  Several other writers have called Dorset home, including [[Douglas Adams]] (''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''), who lived in [[Stalbridge]] for a time; [[Ian Fleming]] (''[[James Bond]]''), who boarded at [[The Old Malthouse|Durnford School]], poet [[William Barnes]]; [[Theodore Francis Powys]]; [[John le Carré]], author of espionage novels; [[P.D. James]] (''[[Children of Men]]''); [[satire|satirical]] novelist [[Thomas Love Peacock]]; [[John Fowles]] (''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]''), lived in [[Lyme Regis]] before he died in late 2005; [[John Cowper Powys]], who set a number of his most famous novels in Dorset and Somerset; and  [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] wrote [[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]] while living in [[Bournemouth]].   	

Dorset is also the birthplace of [[artist]] Sir [[James Thornhill]], musicians [[P.J. Harvey]] and [[Robert Fripp]], [[photography|photographer]] [[Jane Bown]], [[paleontologist]] [[Mary Anning]] and [[archbishop]]s [[John Morton]] and [[William Wake]]. [[List of explorers|Explorer]] Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] lived in Dorset for some of his life, whilst [[Scientist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Robert Boyle]] lived in Stalbridge Manor for a time.  Dorset is a popular home for celebrities. Those who have moved to or own second homes in Dorset include [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Guy Ritchie]], actor [[Martin Clunes]], singer-songwriter [[Billy Bragg]], [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] singer [[Noel Gallagher]] and footballer [[Jamie Redknapp]].<ref>BBC Dorset, n.d. "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dorset/content/articles/2004/10/13/celebrities_feature.shtml Dorset Celebrities]".</ref> Many of [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]]'s television programmes are filmed at his home, just outside of [[Bridport]]. [[Tim Berners-Lee]], inventor of the [[World Wide Web]] lived in [[Colehill]] near [[Wimborne]].

==Settlements and communications==

Dorset is largely rural with many small villages, few large towns, and no cities. The largest [[conurbation]] is the [[South East Dorset conurbation]] which consists of the [[seaside resort]] of [[Bournemouth]], the historic port of [[Poole]] and the town of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] plus many villages. Bournemouth was created in the [[Victorian era]] when sea bathing became popular. As an example of how affluent the area has become, [[Sandbanks]] in Poole was worthless land unwanted by farmers in the 19th century, but is said to be amongst the highest land values by area in the world.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/dorset/4440107.stm "Island on the market for £2.5 million"], ''[[BBC News]]'' April 13, 2005</ref> Bournemouth and Christchurch were added to the county from [[Hampshire]] in the county boundary changes of 1974.

The other two major settlements in the county are Dorchester, the county town, and [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], one of the first [[tourism|tourist towns]], frequented by [[George III of Great Britain|George III]], and still very popular today.

[[Blandford Forum]], [[Sherborne]], [[Gillingham, Dorset|Gillingham]], [[Shaftesbury]] and [[Sturminster Newton]] are historical [[market town]]s which serve the farms and villages of the Blackmore Vale (Hardy's ''Vale of the Little Dairies'').  Blandford is home to the Badger brewery of [[Hall and Woodhouse]]. [[Bridport]], [[Lyme Regis]], [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Wimborne Minster]] are also market towns.  Lyme Regis and [[Swanage]] are small coastal towns popular with tourists.

Currently in construction on the western edge of Dorchester is the experimental [[new town]] of [[Poundbury]], commissioned and co-designed by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]].  The suburb is designed to integrate residential and retail buildings and counter the growth of dormitory towns and car-oriented development.

Dorset is connected to [[London]] by two main [[railway]] lines. The [[West of England Main Line]] runs through the north of the county at Gillingham and Sherborne. The [[South Western Main Line]] runs through the south at Bournemouth, Poole, Dorchester and the terminus at Weymouth. Additionally, the [[Heart of Wessex Line]] runs from Weymouth to [[Bristol]]. Dorset is one of only four non metropolitan counties in England to not have a single motorway. The [[A303 road|A303]], [[A31 road|A31]] and [[A35 road|A35]] [[trunk road]]s run through the county. The only passenger [[airport]] in the county is [[Bournemouth International Airport]], and there are two passenger [[sea port]]s, at Poole and Weymouth.
