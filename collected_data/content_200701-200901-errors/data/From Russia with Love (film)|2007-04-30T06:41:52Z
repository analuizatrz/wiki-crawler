'''''From Russia with Love''''' is the 2nd [[film]] in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]] and the second to star [[Sean Connery]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. The film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]. It is based on the [[From Russia with Love|1957 novel]] by [[Ian Fleming]].  The world premiere was on October 10, [[1963 in film|1963]], at the Odeon, Leicester Square, London. In the film, James Bond is sent to [[Turkey]] to assist in the defection of Corporal Tatiana Romanova, where SPECTRE plans to get revenge for the killing of [[Dr. Julius No|Dr. No]].

It is considered the best of the James Bond film series by many fans and critics, and by actor Sean Connery (who restated his view in a 2002 interview with [[Sam Donaldson]] for [[ABC News]]). Although the film's low-key tone contrasts with the popular outlandishness of ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', ''From Russia with Love'' is often considered the ideal Bond film that each film strives to aim for. [[Michael G. Wilson]], the current co-producer of the series with his half sister [[Barbara Broccoli]], has stated "We always start out trying to make another ''From Russia with Love'' and end up with another ''Thunderball''." In 2004, ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine named it the ninth-greatest British film of all time.

In 2005 it was adapted into a [[video game]], ''[[James Bond 007: From Russia with Love]]''. Produced by [[Electronic Arts]], the game featured all-new voice work by Sean Connery as well as his likeness and those of several of the film's supporting cast.

==Production==
As [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] had named ''[[From Russia with Love]]'' among his ten favourite books of all time, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to the cinematic debut of [[James Bond]], ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel was a [[Cold War]] thriller, however the producers made the villains [[SPECTRE]] instead of the [[Soviet]] undercover agency [[SMERSH]]. The film introduced the now standard pre-credits sequence, the use of a popular singer to sing the theme, and the line "James Bond will be back" in the credits.  Incidentally, the film is said to have been the last Kennedy saw before his assasination.

Although uncredited, the actor who 'played' [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], a.k.a. Number One of [[SPECTRE]] was [[Anthony Dawson]], the actor who had played Professor Dent in the previous Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', also directed by [[Terence Young]]. In the end credits, Blofeld was credited with a [[question mark]]. Blofeld's voice was provided by Viennese actor [[Eric Pohlmann]].

Reportedly, author and James Bond creator Ian Fleming makes a cameo in the Istanbul train scene (following Bond's stealing the LEKTOR decoder), standing outside on the right of the train, wearing grey trousers and a white sweater; some sources deny Fleming's appearance.

The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed later became the traditional [[screen test]] scene for prospective James Bond actors. This screen test forms part of the [[Ultimate Edition Dvd]] series, showing potential candidates auditioning for the role down the years: [[James Brolin]], [[Sean Bean]] and [[Sam Neill]] along with future 007 [[Pierce Brosnan]].  The scene has also been used to audition several James Bond leading ladies, including [[Maryam D'Abo]] and [[Maud Adams]].

==Vehicles and gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}
*[[Attache case]] &mdash; Technically, James Bond's first gadget. The briefcase issued to 007 by Q-Branch contains a folding [[AR-7]] [[sniper rifle]] with twenty rounds of ammunition, a pop-out flat throwing knife and fifty [[gold sovereign]]s for bribery/a hard currency reserve in secret compartments accessible from inside the case. In addition, the case has a trick safety mechanism that detonates a magnetically attached [[tear gas]] bomb if it is improperly opened. This standard-issue item is also carried by Nash in the film (and so appropriated by Grant), and is obliquely mentioned in ''[[Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[Licence to Kill]]''.
*[[Pager]] &mdash; Although ''From Russia with Love'' was filmed in the [[1960s]], before this gadget's invention, Bond carried one, enabling MI6 to contact him at once; also, Bond's Bentley automobile had a radio-telephone, a device some newspaper reporters had obtained in the 1950s. (Joe Martin of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' was pictured using one in an archive photo published in one of the paper's 1990s anniversary retrospectives.)
*Bug detector &mdash; A small device that is designed to detect the presence of a [[Telephone tapping|phone tap]] device in a normal telephone when placed against such a device.
*Tape recorder disguised as a camera.

==Plot==
{{plot}}

{{spoiler}}
In the pre-credits, the film opens in a late night time scene in a mansion garden where James Bond is alternately stalking and being stalked through an ornate garden by a tall, blond assassin. Bond is captured and stangled violently to death by the man named [[Red Grant]]. Suddenly, huge floodlights switch on and 'Bond' turns out to be a man wearing a Bond mask - it's all been a training exercise staged by SPECTRE.   
    
[[Kronsteen]], SPECTRE's chess [[grandmaster]] and master planner has devised a plot to steal a Lektor decoding device from the Russians, and embarrass the British Secret Service in revenge for the killing of their operative Dr. No. Ex [[SMERSH]] operative [[Rosa Klebb]] is placed in charge of the mission by the sinister [[Blofeld]] has already chosen a female operative, a Russian cypher clerk at the Istanbul embassy and has been able to keep the fact of her own defection to SPECTRE a secret. Klebb departs to SPECTRE Island, the organisation's secret training base, to assess the murderous Donald [[Red Grant]], "a homicidal paranoiac".  
    
After leisure time with [[Sylvia Trench]],  M tells Bond that Romanova has contacted Station T in [[Turkey]], run by agent [[Karim Bey]], asking to defect and bringing with her a Lektor device, which both [[MI5]] and the [[CIA]] have been after for years. It also appears that Romanova is claiming to be in love with Bond. Bond realises that it's a trap although immediately becomes attracted by her photograph, but with the Lektor as bait M decides that Bond should take on the mission anyway.   
    
Boothroyd from Q division enters and shows Bond a special black leather attach√© case crammed to the gills with all manner of toys and gadgets, including 20 rounds of [[ammunition]], a flat throwing knife, a .22 folding sniper's rifle, 50 gold sovereigns and a [[tear gas]] [[grenade]] concealed in a tin of [[talcum powder]]. 

After a brief flirtation with Moneypenny (during which M demands the return of a photograph of Romanova he had let Bond look at earlier, signing it, ''with love, from Russia''), Bond flies to [[Istanbul]] where he is followed both by an unkempt man in glasses and by Grant, on the way from the airport to meet Karim Bey, who is later almost murdered when a limpet mine attached to the wall of his house explodes.  

Bond meanwhile checks in to his hotel where he checks his room and finds it full of hidden bugs. Pretending that the bed is too small, Bond asks to be moved but is told by the staff - who all seem to Russian agents - that only the bridal suit is available. He calls their bluff and takes it.   
    
Outside the Russian consulate, Grant abandons his car and drives off in another. The Consulate guard checks the abandoned car and finds a dead Russian agent in the back seat. In the other car, Klebb tells Grant that the Russians will suspect the British and that the [[Cold War]] in Turkey is about to intensify and remain "cold no longer".   

Next day, Bey takes Bond down to his [[cellar]] where they board his small rowing boat on the underwater canal, a giant underground system in which he has control of under the city. Eventually they come to a chamber beneath the Russian [[consulate]] and using a [[periscope]] spying on the meeting in the Russian main conference room spotting the Bulgarian Krilencu and Romanovas legs. Later they head for a rural gypsy settlement in the Turkish country where Bey has contacts and where Bond can hide from the attentions of Krilencu.   
    
However the gypsy camp is violently interrupted by the arrival of Krilencu's aggressive henchmen, who set about laying waste to the settlement amid much gunfire and struggling with knives. Grant is lurking nearby and shoots any man who looks like he might be about to kill Bond and eventually fight off the Bulgars. but Karim Bey is wounded in the attack. The next day, leaving the camp Bey gets his revenge by killing Krilencu with a sniper in a hotel behind a giant facade advertising the [[Bob Hope]] / [[Anita Ekberg]] movie [[Call Me Bwana]]. 

When Bond returns to his hotel suite, he finds Romanova in bed waiting for him. Bond and Romanova make love, unaware that they are being filmed by Grant and Klebb. 
[[Image:Hagia-Sofia-Int-01s.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Bond visits the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Istanbul]] 

The next day, Romanova heads off for a pre-arranged rendezvous at a nearby [[Hagia Sophia]] [[mosque]]. Bond spies the scruffy, bespectacled man who had followed him from the Istanbul airport, but soon he is, unseen by Bond, killed by Grant. When Bond finds the body, he also finds the plans for the Russian Consulate he has been seeking leaving Bey highly suspicious of the simplicity of events.

[[Image:Grant 007.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Red Grant]]]]
Bond arranges to meet Romanova on a [[ferry]] and records her telling him about the Lektor. The tape is later analysed back in London by M, Q and other agents and is later informed    
that Romanova's description of the device seems genuine and that he is to go ahead with the deal. He applies for a visa from the Russian Consulate, allowing his access to the building. At a pre-arranged moment, Bey sets off an explosive charge in the chamber beneath the building, releasing tear gas throughout the Consulate. In the resulting chaos, Bond is able to find Romanova and make off with the decoder, joining Bey to make their escape aboard the Orient Express, pursued by Soviet security man Benz who recognises Romanova. Grant is already on the train. Bey has arranged cover for Bond and Romanova as a married couple, Mr and Mrs David and Caroline Somerset which Romanova is very pleased about. Bey and Bond confront Benz in his cabin and restrain him before Bond returns to Romanova where he fails to resist the power of her slinky new dress. 

Later, while heading for the restaurant car, Bond is stopped by the guard with bad news - he takes him to Benz's cabin where the Soviet agent and Bey have apparently killed each other in a violent battle. Bond breaks the news of Bey's death to Romanova, accusing her of acting under orders and roughing her up. She insists that she knows nothing and that she really does genuinely love Bond.    
    
The train continues on its journey across southern-central [[Europe]],  arriving at Beograd where Bond in meeting one of Bey's sons arranges for an agent from Station Y to meet him at [[Zagreb]]. However there Grant intercepts the British agent and then poses as agent Nash,  boarding the train with Bond as it sets off again. In his cabin, Bond tells 'Nash' about the Lektor and about how difficult it will be to get it across the border. Bond becomes suspicious of 'Nash' when he witnesses him spiking Romanova's drink.  
  
While she's unconscious in one part of the cabin, Grant knocks Bond out in the other half of the small cabin quarters and taunts Bond when he revives. Only now does Bond realise that SPECTRE is involved in his mission and that they have been playing the Russians and the British off against each other, keeping him alive until he could get the Lektor device for them. He also tells Bond that Romanova is innocent and that [[Rosa Klebb]], whom Bond also knows as a SMERSH operative, has now defected to [[SPECTRE]]. He also tells Bond that his death will be staged as a crime of passion - they'll plant the film of Bond and Romanova making love on Romanova and a letter apparently from her threatening to release the film to the press will be planted on him. This way, it'll seem as though she was trying to [[blackmail]] Bond and he killed her before taking his own life.   
    
However in one last attempt to save his life, Bond offers to buy his last cigarette for 50 gold sovereigns and dupes Grant into opening the booby trapped attach√© case. A struggle breaks out during which Bond and Grant brutally assault each other in the narrow confines of the train compartment, where Bond is eventually able to stab him with the concealed blade from the attach√© case, then ends up strangling him. He takes the incriminating reel of film from Grant's pocket but doesn't destroy it - yet..  
   
[[Image:FromRussiahelicopter.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Somewhere in Yugoslavia the flower truck is attacked by a SPECTRE helicopter]]  
At Grant's pre-arranged escape point Bond leaves the train with a doped Romanova overpowering the SPECTRE operative in the flower truck and driving off into the Balkan countryside. As dawn breaks, they are spotted and buzzed by a SPECTRE helicopter which begin bombing the truck with grenades, but in taking refuge beneath some rocks is shot down. Bond drives on, eventually reaching a boat waiting at a remote dock and with Romanova set off on the boat heading for Venice.   
    
Klebb and Kronsteen try to explain their failures to their leader Blofeld, but he remarks that his organization does not tolerate failure and has Kronsteen murdered by his henchman Morzeny who kicks him with a poison tipped blade hidden in his boot. 
   
[[Image:007Russiaflaregun.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Bond with the flare gun as the barrels are ignited]]  

Bond and Romanova make progress towards [[Venice]] when they are suddenly intercepted by Morzeny leading SPECTRE agents with a small fleet of [[power boat]]s. armed with [[rifle]] [[grenade]]s. When their stray [[bullet]]s puncture several [[barrel]]s of [[fuel]] stored on his boat, Bond throws them overboard, pretending to surrender as he fires flares into the water which, now full of oil, explodes, engulfing the pursuing boats in flames.
    
Finally, when Bond and Romanova arrive in Venice and check into a hotel, Rosa Klebb disguised as a maid, has managed to get into his room and is trying to whisk the Lektor away from under his nose while he is making a phone call. However, Romanova disarms Klebb who tries to kick Bond with her own poison tipped toe-blade but is shot by Romanova. With their mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova take time for a romantic gondola trip and Bond throws the film of him and Romanova making love into the canal as the credits roll and the "From Russia With Love" main track plays.

''From Russia with Love'' is the first series film with [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] as the primary soundtrack composer. The theme song, "From Russia with Love", was composed by [[Lionel Bart]] of ''[[Oliver!]]'' fame and sung by [[Matt Monro]], although the title credit music is a lively instrumental version of the tune (segueing into the "James Bond Theme"). Monro's vocal version is later played during the film (as source music on a radio) and properly over the film's end titles. 

John Barry, arranger of [[Monty Norman]]'s "[[James Bond Theme]]" for ''Dr. No'', would be the dominant Bond series composer for most of its history and the inspiration for the current lead Bond movie composer, [[David Arnold]] (who uses cues from this soundtrack in his own for ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''). In this film, Barry introduced the percussive theme "[[James Bond music#007|007]]" ‚Äì action music that came to be considered the 'secondary James Bond Theme' and is used in various of the Bond films of Sean Connery, and also [[Roger Moore]]'s ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''. The arrangement appears twice on this soundtrack album; the second version, entitled "007 Takes the Lektor", is the one used during the gunfight at the gypsy camp and also during Bond's theft of the Lektor decoding machine.) 

The completed film features a holdover from the Monty Norman-supervised ''Dr. No'' music ‚Äì the post-rocket-launch music from ''No'' (after Bond disrupts No's attempts to jam the takeoff) appears in ''Russia'' at the conclusion of the helicopter attack,  and also at the attempt of SPECTRE to intercept Bond's speedboat. This cue, incidentally lifted by Arnold for ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', is naturally absent from the ''Russia'' soundtrack album.

As Barry himself notes, 1964's ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' would be the first Bond film in which he had total creative control over the soundtrack, including the music of the theme song. ([[Leslie Bricusse]] and [[Anthony Newley]] would contribute the theme's lyrics).

==Reception==
'From Russia With Love' premiered on 10th of October 1963. It received rave reviews, and became the first James Bond film that was a box office hit. It was soon heralded as 'the most successful film ever released in Britain in any year.'
It currently has a 96% rating on [[www.rottentomatoes.com]]

==Trivia==
[[Alfred Hitchcock]] was originally considered as director for the film version in 1958, with Bond to be played by [[Cary Grant]] and a possible return to the screen for [[Grace Kelly]] as Tatiana Romanova, but the deals fell through when ''[[Vertigo (movie)|Vertigo]]'' performed badly at the box office. The helicopter scene in ''From Russia with Love'' mimics the cropduster scene from the film Hitchcock did instead in ''[[North by Northwest]]''.  
  
[[Pedro Armend√°riz]], who played Kerim Bey had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and reportedly did this role to provide financially for his family before his impending death. Armend√°riz's scenes were given top priority and he limps visibly in most of them. On the evening of June 18, 1963, while at the [[UCLA]] medical center, a gun was smuggled into his hospital room and the 51-year-old Armend√°riz took his own life. Twenty-five years later, his son, [[Pedro Armend√°riz Jr.]], also an actor, was hired for a small role in the [[1989]] James Bond film ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' as the President of the fictional Republic of Isthmus.   
    
Lotte Lenya's character, Colonel Rosa Klebb, often is cited as prototype of the Frau Farbissina character in the [[Austin Powers]] spy spoof series. Klebb would be the first of several Bond villains with ambiguous sexuality. Although in the novel this was made more explicit, Klebb's lesbian tendencies in the film are more hinted at by having her place her hand on Romanova's knee and moments later stroking her hair during a scene with her briefing Tatiana. Lotte Lenya was the widow of [[Kurt Weill]]. In the film "Undercover Blues" starring Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner, in the mock-torture scene, Dennis Quaid refers to Kathleen Turner (who was pretending to be a Russian doctor specializing in pain) as "Dr Lottelenya of the "Rosa Klebb Institute"), a clear tribute to Lotte Lenya's portrayal of Rosa Klebb.  
    
The Bulgarian assassin Krilencu tries to escape from his apartment through a secret window in a billboard advertising ''[[Call Me Bwana]]'' with the face of [[Anita Ekberg]], the only non-James Bond film produced by [[EON Productions]]. Incidentally, [[Rik Van Nutter]] who would play Felix Leiter in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' was married to Ekberg.   
   
The "007" theme (the song played during the gunfight at the gypsy camp and also during Bond's theft of the LEKTOR) was used as part of the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format on [[Philadelphia]] television station [[KYW-TV]].    
   
A version of the haunting "Stalking" track -- from the pre-credit sequence of ''From Russia with Love'' involving Connery and Shaw -- appears in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', when Bond ([[Roger Moore]]) and Anya Amasova (Agent XXX, played by [[Barbara Bach]]) confront [[Richard Kiel]]'s Jaws character at a historic site in Egypt. Ironically, ''Spy'' was scored not by Barry but [[Marvin Hamlisch]], one of only four times Barry did not helm the Bond music arrangements in the first 16 [[United Artists]] installments.   
    
Assistant director [[Kit Lambert]], later became a record producer and manager for the rock band [[The Who]].   
   
During one take of the helicopter scene, the helicopter flew too close to Connery and he would have been injured or killed had he not dived out of the way.   
   
In the opening credit sequence [[Martine Beswick]], who played the gypsy girl Zora, is credited as Martin Beswick. This was recitifed on later DVD releases.   
   
The periscope used to spy on the Russian Embassy was a wooden dummy built by UK manufacturer Barr & Stroud.   
    
Italian actress [[Daniela Bianchi]] (Tatiana Romanova) possessed limited English language skills, thus her voice was dubbed by [[Barbara Jefford]]   
   
''From Russia With Love'' is the first Bond film to end with the ubiquitous post-credits tagline "James Bond will be back in..."
