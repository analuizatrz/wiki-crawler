The '''New England Patriots''', commonly called the "'''Pats'''" by sports writers and fans,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=nwe ESPN.com] An example of the "Pats" nickname being used within sports reports. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> are a professional [[American football]] team based in the [[Greater Boston]] area, playing their home games in the town of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxborough]], [[Massachusetts]]. The team is part of the [[American Football Conference East Division|Eastern Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The owners changed the name from the original '''Boston Patriots''' after [[relocation of professional sports teams|relocating the team]] to Foxborough in 1971. They are currently the American Football Conference Champions, after winning the [[American Football Conference Championship Game|2007 AFC Championship Game]].

An original member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), the Patriots joined the NFL in the [[AFL-NFL Merger|1970 merger]] of those leagues. The team advanced to the playoffs four times before appearing in [[Super Bowl XX]] in January 1986, losing to the [[Chicago Bears]]. The team also appeared in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] in 1997, losing to the [[Green Bay Packers]]. 

Between 2001 and 2005, the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the [[Dallas Cowboys]]) to win three Super Bowls in four years ([[Super Bowl XXXVI]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|XXXIX]]), and the eighth to win consecutive Super Bowls. As [[Boston Globe]] sports columnist [[Dan Shaughnessy]] wrote after the Super Bowl XXXIX win: "...the New England Patriots of the 21st century are established as an NFL [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]] on a par with the Packers of the 1960s, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]] of the '70s, the [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]] of the '80s, and the Cowboys of the '90s."<ref>

</ref> In 2007, the Patriots became only the second team in the [[NFL#The Merger|modern era of the NFL]] to complete a [[Perfect season|perfect regular season]] with a record of 16-0, and the first team to do so since the introduction of the 16-game season.

[[Image:NewEnglandPatriotsOld.png|left|framed|"Pat Patriot" logo]]
On [[November 16]] [[1959]], Boston business executive [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]] was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing [[American Football League]] (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice—and the one that Sullivan selected—was "Boston Patriots".  Immediately thereafter, Phil Bissell developed the [[Logos and Uniforms of the New England Patriots|"Pat Patriot" logo]].<ref name=patshistory> {{cite web | title = Official New England Patriots History | url = http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History | accessdate = 2008-01-13 | work = Patriots.com | publisher= New England Patriots}}</ref>

The Patriots time in the AFL saw them struggle most years as they never had a regular home stadium.  [[Nickerson Field]], [[Harvard Stadium]], [[Fenway Park]], and [[Alumni Stadium]] all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League.  They did play in one [[American Football League playoffs|AFL championship game]], following the [[1963 AFL season|1963 season]].  They lost to the [[San Diego Chargers]] 51-10.  They would not appear again in an AFL or NFL [[NFL playoffs|post-season]] game for another 13 years.<ref name=patshistory/>

When the NFL and AFL [[AFL-NFL merger|merged in 1970]], the Patriots were placed in the [[American Football Conference East Division|AFC East]] division, where they still play today.  The following year, the Patriots moved to a [[Foxboro Stadium|new stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], which would serve as their home for 30 years.  As a result of the move, they would change their name from the Boston Patriots to the New England Patriots.  During the 1970s, the Patriots had some success, earning a berth to the playoffs in 1976&mdash;as a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]]-berth&mdash;and in 1978&mdash;as AFC East champions.  They would lose both games.  In 1985, they returned to the playoffs, and made it all the way to [[Super Bowl XX]], which they lost to the [[Chicago Bears]] 46&ndash;10.  Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round.  The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years.  They changed ownership several times, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by [[Victor Kiam]] in 1988, who sold the team to [[James Orthwein]] in 1992.  Orthwein intended to move the team to his native [[St. Louis, Missouri]], but sold the team two years later to current owner [[Robert Kraft]] in 1994.<ref name=patshistory/>

[[Image:NewEnglandPatriots.png|left|framed|Current logo, introduced in 1993]]
Though Orthwein's period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team.  Former [[New York Giants]] coach [[Bill Parcells]] was hired in 1993, and the drastic changes were made the same year to the Patriots uniforms, changing their primary colors from their traditional red and white to blue and silver, and introducing a new logo, which was designed by Kevin Loh<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-plaschke20jan20,1,2731790.column?coll=la-headlines-sports&ctrack=1&cset=true Article by [[Bill Plaschke]] on Kevin Loh's design of the new Patriots' logo.] LATIMES.COM. Accessed 20 January 2008.</ref>. Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including [[Super Bowl XXXI]], which they lost to the [[Green Bay Packers]] by a score of 35&ndash;21.  [[Pete Carroll]], Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice.<ref name=patshistory/>

The Patriots current coach, [[Bill Belichick]], was hired in 2000, and a new home field, [[Gillette Stadium]] was opened in 2002.  Under Belichick, the team went to three Super Bowls in four years, and finished the [[2007 NFL season|2007 regular season]] with a perfect 16-0 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, and the only one since the league expanded its [[regular season (NFL)|regular season]] schedule to 16 games.<ref name=patshistory/>  They defeated the San Diego Chargers, 21-12, in the AFC Championship game on January 20, 2008, to advance to their fourth Super Bowl in 7 years. They became the first team in NFL history to go 18 wins and 0 losses.

==Cheerleaders==
[[Image:New England Patriots Cheerleaders (USAF).jpg|right|thumb|The Patriots Cheerleaders performing a routine in 2007]]
The Patriots [[NFL Cheerleader]]s are simply known as the The Patriots Cheerleaders. In 2005, cheerleader Kristin Gauvin won [[Miss Massachusetts]], in part from her local commitment with the Patriots.

==End-zone militia==
During each game, about 10 men dressed as [[minutemen]] line the back of each end zone.  When the Patriots score a [[touchdown]] or field goal, the militia behind the opposite end zone fire a round of blanks from [[flintlock|flintlock muskets]].  After the [[Extra point|point-after-touchdown]] (PAT) attempt, the men fire their guns to [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] [[1812 Overture]].  ESPN named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=3139628 ESPN.com] It's a Celebration: Best NFL Touchdown Celebrations, Josh Pahigian, 12/3/07</ref>.

==Radio and television==
As of 2007, the Patriots' flagship radio station is [[WBCN]] 104.1FM, owned by [[CBS Radio]]. The larger radio network is called the "[[Patriots Rock Radio Network]]," whose 35 affiliate stations span 7 states. [[Gil Santos]] and [[Gino Cappelletti]] are the longtime announcing team.

Any preseason games not on national television are shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WCVB]]. [[Don Criqui]] has been the [[play-by-play]] announcer the last several years, with [[Randy Cross]] as a [[color commentator]] and [[Mike Lynch (sportscaster)|Mike Lynch]] as a [[sideline reporter]].
