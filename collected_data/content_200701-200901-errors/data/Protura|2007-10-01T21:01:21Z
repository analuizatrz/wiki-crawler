The '''Protura''', or '''proturans''', are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[Hexapoda|hexapods]] previously treated as insects, and sometimes treated as a [[Class (biology)|class]]&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/Courses/Eeb477/ |title=Insect phylogeny |author=Charles S. Henry |publisher=[[University of Connecticut]] |year=2005}}</ref>. They are very small (<2&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] long) soil-dwelling animals and are unique among arthropods for showing [[anamorphosis (biology)|anamorphic]] development, whereby [[body segment]]s are added during [[ecdysis|moults]]&nbsp;<ref name="Gullan">{{cite book |title=The insects: an outline of entomology |author=P. J. Gullan & P. S. Cranston |publisher=[[Chapman and Hall]] |id=ISBN 0-412-49360-8}}</ref>. A total of around 500 species have been described worldwide, in four to eight [[family (biology)|families]]&nbsp;<ref name="tolweb"/>, making Protura the smallest class in the phylum Arthropoda&nbsp;<ref name="Carolina">{{cite web |url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/compendium/protura.html |title=Protura |date=[[2005-03-05]] |author=John R. Meyer |publisher=[[North Carolina State University]]}}</ref>.

==Morphology==
Proturans have no eyes, wings or antennae and lack [[pigment]]ation: they are usually white or pale brown. The sensory function of the antennae is fulfilled by the first of three pairs of five-segmented [[arthropod leg|legs]], which are held pointing forwards and have many tarsal sensilla and sensory hairs&nbsp;<ref name="Florida">{{cite web |url=http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/misc/proturans.htm |title=Proturans |author=Christopher Tipping |date=2004 |publisher=[[University of Florida]]}}</ref>. The head is conical, and bears two ''pseudoculi'' which are used for sensing light and may be the [[vestigial structure|remnants]] of eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;<ref name="Carolina"/>. The body is elongate and cylindrical&nbsp;<ref name="CSIRO">{{cite web |url=http://www.ento.csiro.au/education/hexapods/protura.html |title=Protura |publisher=[[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]]}}</ref>. The [[mouthparts]] are [[Entognatha|endognathous]] (enclosed within the head capsule) and consist of thin [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]] and maxillae&nbsp;<ref name="Gullan"/>. There are no [[cercus|cerci]] at the end of the abdomen, which gives the group their name, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''proto-'' (meaning "first", in this case implying primitive), and ''our'', meaning "tail"&nbsp;<ref name="Carolina"/>. The first three abdominal segments bear limb-like [[appendage]]s&nbsp;<ref name="Florida"/> called "styli"&nbsp;<ref name="Carolina"/>. The [[Sex organ|genitalia]] are internal and the genital opening lies between the eleventh segment and the [[telson]] of the adult<ref name="Florida"/>. Members of [[Eosentomoidea]] possess [[spiracle]]s and a simple [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheal]] system while those in the Acerentomoidea lack these structures and perform [[gas exchange]] by [[diffusion]]&nbsp;<ref name="Florida"/>.

==Ecology==
Proturans live chiefly in [[soil]], [[moss]] and [[leaf litter]]&nbsp;<ref name="Gullan"/> of moist temperate forests&nbsp;<ref name="Carolina"/> which are not too acidic&nbsp;<ref name="Gordon">{{cite web |url=http://www.earthlife.net/insects/protura.html |title=Gordon's Protura Page |date=[[2005-11-11]]}}</ref>, but have also been found beneath rocks or under the [[bark]] of trees&nbsp;<ref name="CSIRO"/>, as well as in animal burrows&nbsp;<ref name="Florida"/>. They are generally restricted to the uppermost 10&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]]&nbsp;<ref name="Gordon"/>, but have been found as deep as 10&nbsp;[[inch]]es (25&nbsp;cm)<ref name="tolweb"/>. Although they are sometimes considered uncommon&nbsp;<ref name="Carolina"/>, they are probably often overlooked because of their small size&nbsp;<ref name="CSIRO"/>, and densities of over 90,000 individuals per [[square metre]] have been measured&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Krauß, J. & W. Funke |year=1999 |title=Extraordinary high density of Protura in a windfall area of young spruce plants |journal=[[Pedobiologia]] |volume=43 |pages=44–46}}</ref>.

The diet of proturans is uncertain, but they feed on [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]], dead [[Acarina|Acari]], and [[mushroom powder]] in culture&nbsp;<ref name="Florida"/> and are thought to feed on decaying vegetable matter and fungi in the wild&nbsp;<ref name="CSIRO"/><ref name="Carolina"/>. The styliform mouthparts suggest that Protura are [[fluid feeder]]s and there is evidence that some species suck out the contents of [[hypha|fungal hyphae]]&nbsp;<ref name="Gordon"/>.

Proturans which live near the soil surface generally have one generation per year and have longer legs while those that live deeper have shorter legs and reproduce less seasonally, although there are also [[Insect migration|migratory]] species which move to deeper layers for the winter and shallower layers for the summer&nbsp;<ref name="Gordon"/>.

==Development==
The [[larva]] has nine abdominal segments, but the number increases through [[ecdysis|moulting]] until the full adult number of twelve is reached. This process of [[anamorphosis (biology)|anamorphosis]] is not found in any other group of [[arthropod]]s. Further moults may occur, but do not involve any additional body segments&nbsp;<ref name="Carolina"/>, and
it is not known whether the adults continue to moult throughout their lives&nbsp;<ref name="Florida"/>. [[Egg (biology)|Eggs]] have only been observed in a few species&nbsp;<ref name="Florida"/>. Five developmental stages follow: the [[prelarva]] hatches from the egg and has only weakly developed mouthparts and nine abdominal segments; larva I follows and has fully developed mouthparts; larva II has ten adbominal segments; maturus junior has twelve abdominal segments and is followed by the adult&nbsp;<ref name="Florida"/>. The family Acerentomidae differs in having an extra pre-[[imago]] stage, with partially developed genitalia, between the maturus junior and the adult&nbsp;<ref name="Florida"/>.

==History==
Proturans were first discovered in the early [[20th century|twentieth century]], when [[Filippo Silvestri]] and [[Antonio Berlese]] discovered the animals independently&nbsp;<ref name="Gordon"/>. The first species to be described was ''[[Acerentomon doderoi]]'', published in 1907 by Silvestri&nbsp;<ref name="Florida"/> based on material from near [[Syracuse, New York]]&nbsp;<ref name="Carolina"/>.
