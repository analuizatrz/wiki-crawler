'''''Carnivàle''''', pronounced /{{IPA|kɑɹ.nɪ’væl}}/ (“car-nih-VAL”), is an [[United States|American]] dramatic [[television series]] produced by [[Home Box Office|HBO]]. Created by [[Daniel Knauf]], it starred [[Nick Stahl]] and [[Clancy Brown]]. The show ran from 2003-2005.

The series is a period drama set in the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression]]. It is an overarching story about the battle between [[good]] and [[evil]] as well as the struggle between [[free will]] and [[destiny]].

==Overview==

===Season 1===

At the beginning of the first episode, the carnival’s manager (a dwarf named Samson) says:

<blockquote>Before the beginning, after the great war between heaven and hell, God created the Earth and gave dominion over it to the crafty ape he called man...and to each generation was born a creature of light and a creature of darkness...and great armies clashed by night in the ancient war between good and evil. There was magic then. Nobility. And unimaginable cruelty. And so it was until the day that a false sun exploded over [[Trinity site|Trinity]], and man forever traded away wonder for reason.</blockquote>

This quotation offers a glimpse into the show’s subject matter and framework.

The story consists of two main plot lines that are slowly converging. The first involves a young man with strange healing powers named [[Ben Hawkins]], the “creature of light,” who joins a travelling carnival when it passes near his home in [[Milfay, Oklahoma]]. Soon thereafter, Ben begins experiencing strange dreams and visions, and finds himself on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder, a drifter who crossed paths with the carnival many years before...and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben’s own. Scudder is eventually revealed to be Ben’s father.

The second plotline revolves around a [[Father Coughlin]]-esque Methodist preacher, [[Brother Justin Crowe]], the “creature of darkness,” Ben’s opposite and his ultimate nemesis. Justin is also learning the extent of his strange powers, which seem to include the ability to bend human beings to his will, and to make their sins or “greatest evils” manifest in the form of terrifying, traumatic visions. Justin experiences surreal, prophetic dreams similar to those of his young counterpart.

As the story progresses, the carnival travels west toward California and a confrontation seems inevitable. The westward movement parallels the migration of the [[Okies]] (migrant workers and itinerant laborers) from [[Oklahoma]] to [[California]] during the [[Dust Bowl]] era.

===Season 2===

Samson also initiates us into the second season, saying:

<blockquote>On the heels of the skirmish Man foolishly called the war to end all wars, the Dark One sought to elude his destiny...live as a mortal. So he fled across the ocean, to an empire called America...but by his mere presence, a cancer corrupted the spirit of the land. People were rendered mute by fools who spoke many words, but said nothing...for whom oppression and cowardice were virtues...and freedom, an obscenity. Into this new land, the Prophet stalked his enemy...until, diminished by his wounds, he turned to the next in the ancient line of light. And so it was that the fate of all mankind came to rest on the trembling shoulders of the most reluctant of saviors.</blockquote>

In the second season opener, Ben meets the mysterious figure known as Management, the heretofore unseen presence that controls the carnival, and gives Samson his often stupefying orders. Management is actually a man named Lucius Belyakov, Ben’s predecessor and the previous creature of light. Belyakov shows Ben a vision of the first atomic test at Trinity, near Alamogordo, N.M., and tells him that the devastating explosion he’s just witnessed is “the final link in a chain of events that is unfolding even now. ''You'' must break that chain.” (This is the “false sun over Trinity” spoken of in the opening to the first episode.) The only way to do that, Belyakov tells him, is by destroying the preacher Ben sees in his visions.

Meanwhile, Justin (who’s begun delivering weekly sermons over the airwaves via a local radio station, eventually drawing thousands of Okies and migrants to the site of his new ministry outside Mintern, California) is approached by a man named Smith, who identifies Justin as “the Usher” and tells him that, in order for him to attain his full measure of power and thus fulfill his destiny, he must kill Henry Scudder, the previous creature of darkness.

Fortunately, Ben eventually finds Scudder and brings him to Belyakov, who forces him to reveal the identity of Ben’s opposite...Belyakov’s son, Alexi (Justin and his sister Iris were raised by a minister named Norman Balthus, and given their new names, after their mother&mdash;Belyakov’s wife&mdash;was killed in a train derailment). Belyakov then attacks Scudder, forcing Ben to kill him. At that point, all of Belyakov’s knowledge and power passes on to Ben, who proceeds to begin searching for his nemesis.

The second season ends with a dramatic confrontation between Ben and Brother Justin in a field outside New Canaan, California.

The show mixes [[Christianity|Christian]] theology with aspects of [[gnosticism]] and [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lore, particularly that of the [[Knights Templar]].

==Cancellation==

While ratings began agreeably, by the end of the first season, they were down significantly. During the second season, the ratings slowly rose toward the end; however, the show became increasingly expensive to produce at the same time. Many fans suspected that, due to HBO’s tradition of carrying shows through to an end, and Daniel Knauf’s six-year plan, the show would be renewed, but in May [[2005]], it was leaked that the series would not be returning for another season. [[HBO]] confirmed that the show had been cancelled on [[May 11|11 May]] [[2005]].

The show’s ending after its second season and leaving so many plotlines unfinished has outraged many viewers. Some of them organized petitions and mailing drives to HBO in an effort to get the show renewed. According to HBO’s president, this generated more than 50,000 emails to the network in a single weekend.

Had the series continued, several things would have occurred, according to Knauf. The series would have been composed of three “Books,” with two seasons per book, spanning several years. (Thus the first book was completed.) Book II (seasons three and four) would have taken place between 1939 and 1940, and Book III between 1944 and 1945 (leading up to the end of WWII and the explosion at the [[Trinity test|Trinity test site]]).

According to a February 2006 [http://www.mediavillage.com/jmentr/2006/02/09/jmer-02-09-06/ article] on Mediavillage.com, HBO may be considering developing a movie or miniseries that would wrap up many of these plot lines. The article goes on to state that if the ratings are good, HBO may consider renewing the show for a third season.

'''Terms:'''
*Avatara: Those carrying avataric Blood and the Mantle of a House. Can exhibit considerable power.
*Vectori: Any others carrying avataric Blood without a Mantle. Can exhibit minor powers, often crazy.
*Houses: Two exist, one Dark and one Light, representing a moral alignment. Manifest in the world through the transfer of a Mantle to one carrying avataric blood upon birth creating an Avatar.
*Creature of Light/Darkness: Another name for an Avatar of a particular House.
*Mantle: The mechanism through which a House manifests on the mortal plane. Cannot be transferred once given.
*Prophet: Dominant Avatar of a House, always the eldest in terms of generations. Exhibits the Vitae Divina (blue blood).
*Princes: All other Avatara of a House. Eldest generational Prince is Ascendant.
*Dynasty: Unbroken line of Avatara from father to son independent of House.
*Boon: Sum knowledge of the memories and abilities of Prophet.

'''Avataric Blood:'''
One Blood through which the Houses manifest following certain rules:
*Any child of someone carrying avataric Blood also carries the Blood to lessening degree as they become generationally further removed from an Avatar in the bloodline. Such an individual is a Vectorus (e.g., Iris).
*Two Houses, Light and Dark, manifest via the Blood by passing a Mantle at birth and creating an Avatar. The hallmark of an Avatar of Dark is coal black eyes, the hallmark of an Avatar of Light is an “interesting” aura (never seen). An Avatar cannot pass on his Mantle to anyone else (i.e. an Avatar is only born, never made, as evidenced by the failed attempt between Scudder and Lodz).
:*The Mantle is conveyed through the Blood from father to first-born son. If the youngest Prince in a dynasty dies without issue, the first male child born to the world from a Vectori line with the most Blood establishes a new dynasty and receives the Mantle.
::*The only known exceptions to the male restriction are the Alpha and the Omega.
*One Prophet (Dominant/eldest generational Avatar) per House. The Blood becomes Vitae Divina (blue Blood) upon rising to this level. A Prophet knows the given name of his Ascendant Prince.
*The mother of an Avatar is rendered barren and insane upon the child’s birth.
*Any weapon infused with the Vitae Divina is enchanted (anointed). Injuries from such a weapon never fully heal.

'''Wild Card Avatara:'''
Avatara that have special rules in addition to, or replacing, the normal ones.
*The Alpha: The first Avatar&mdash;a female. Her story has been lost since the destruction of the Royal Library of Alexandria by Theophilus, Patriarch of Alexandria (the patron saint of arsonists).
*The Usher of Destruction: An Avataric Prophet who has been foretold as a harbinger of the End Times. Known by a thousand names in a thousand books, the true function of the Usher has yet to be revealed. The primary resource about him and Avatara in general is the Gospel of [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]]. He is represented in prophecy and visions as the Tattooed Man. Protected by the Tattoo of the Tree of Knowledge, he is only susceptible to an anointed weapon thrust into his Dark Heart where the branches of the tattoo meet.
*The Omega: Erroneously considered synonymous with the Usher by most scholars. Commonly accepted to be the last Avatar.

'''Avataric Nature:'''
*Nature is Randomly assigned: Dark can beget Light and Light can beget Dark.
*One Avatar per generation, per House.
*Mortal, but tougher and more resilient than normal humans.
*Ascendant Prince must personally kill the Prophet of the same House to gain his full measure of power: a boon with the sum of the Prophet’s knowledge and power. The Prophet must be in full control of his faculties, and if not willing to pass on the boon, must be taken by surprise else the Prince possibly be harmed in the transfer.
*Free choice is operative allowing an Avatar to act contrary to the nature of their House.
*Dark Avatara react to the actions of Light Avatara (AKA Light heals, Dark feels&mdash;e.g., Justin keeps reacting to Ben healing people).

'''Avataric Abilities:'''
*Both Houses draw from the same pool of powers but use them differently as befits their alignment. Some uses seem more appropriate to one House over the other. Exercise of a power can be trying on an Avatar (e.g. Ben’s nosebleed after astrally projecting). Examples of observed powers:

:*Life force transfer via laying on of hands, limited by the transfer of life energy from the surrounding area (e.g., a Light use is the transfer of energy from plants and animals to heal people. A Dark use could be to drain a person of life and restore something else).
:*Spiritual healing drawing energy only from the Avatar, unlimited in scope (e.g., Ben uses this in a Light manner many times first with the mother and dead child, later with the grandfather pimping his granddaughter. A Dark Avatar might be able to similarly wound the spirit of someone perhaps as seen when Justin shows people their darkest sins).
:*Resurrection requiring the deliberate transfer of one human life for another (only Ben has clearly exhibited this ability).
:*Divination of an object’s location or direction of travel (e.g., Ben Hawkins looking for Scudder after being abducted by Stroud).
:*Conjuring of illusory objects (e.g., the Baggage Trailer and its contents, coins from Eleanor’s mouth).
:*See through another’s eyes (e.g., Ben looks through Stroud’s while he is driving).
:*Astral projection to remote locations (e.g., Ben projecting to the hotel room).
:*Psychometry or the ability to see visions regarding an object or person while touching it.
:*Communication to people subliminally over great distances (e.g., used by Justin through his radio broadcasts).
:*Telekinesis (e.g., used by Justin to slam door closed and control others’ bodies).
:*Ability to read minds (e.g., Justin finding the darkest sins in others).
:*Showing of visions (e.g., Justin showing others their sins, Belyakov showing Ben a possible future).
:*Receive visions of the past, present and future (future visions malleable because of free will).

==Unanswered questions==

At the close of the series, many plot points were left unanswered and unexplained. Some have since been cleared up by Knauf:

*The past relationship between Scudder and Lodz (the two worked a sideshow attraction together in Europe; Lodz was blinded when Scudder unsuccessfully attempted to rid himself of his powers by passing them on to his friend).

*The reason Ben was a fugitive when he first crossed paths with the carnival (he accidentally killed a guard after being imprisoned for attacking the bank manager who foreclosed on his mother’s land).

*The Bear that attacked Belyakov on the battlefield was part of Lodz's circus act before he and Scudder joined forces.

Plot points that remain unexplained include the following:

*Sofie’s ultimate purpose as the Omega.

*Justin’s purpose as the Usher.

*The significance of the vision Ben and Sofie share of the two kissing as the atomic bomb explodes in the background.

*Lodz’s agenda and what he means when he says that he will soon return “in the flesh.”

*The Saunier Manuscript and how it relates to the Avatar.

*How Jonesy will survive his gunshot wound.

*How “the fate of all mankind” hinges upon the explosion at the Trinity test site.

==Lawsuit==

On [[June 9|9 June]] [[2005]], a lawsuit was filed in United States District court by writer Jeff Bergquist. Mr. Bergquist claimed that the creators of ''Carnivàle'' did not originate the idea for the show, but rather stole it from his unpublished novel ''Beulah''. Mr. Bergquist claimed that HBO and ''Carnivàle'' creator Daniel Knauf violated his copyright on ''Beulah'' and sought both recognition and punitive damages. The case was [[Prejudice (law)|dismissed with prejudice]] on [[February 17|17 February]] [[2006]].
