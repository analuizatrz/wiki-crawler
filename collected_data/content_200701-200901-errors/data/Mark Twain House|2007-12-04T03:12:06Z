The '''Mark Twain House''' was the home of [[Mark Twain]] (a.k.a. Samuel Langhorne Clemens) from [[1871]] to [[1891]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], [[USA]]. Before 1871, Twain had lived in [[Hannibal, Missouri]]. The architectural style of the 19-room house itself is [[Victorian Gothic]].

The house is also notable for the major works written during his residency, including ''[[The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today|The Gilded Age]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'', ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'', ''[[A Tramp Abroad]]'' and ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''. 

Bad financial investments caused the Twain family to move to Europe. When they returned to Connecticut in 1900 he lived in a house built for him in Stormfield, Connecticut, where he died on [[April 21]], [[1910]]. It functioned as a school, an apartment building, and a library after that.  In 1962 it was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].<ref name="nhlsum"/><ref name="nrhpinv2">{{citation|title={{PDFlink|[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/66000884.pdf National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Mark Twain House]|659&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 675556 bytes -->}}|date=November 6, 1974 |author=Blanche Higgins Schroer and J.

== Life in the house ==
Mark Twain moved to Hartford in 1871 and purchased the property for his new house in north Hartford. He did so to be closer to his publisher, American Publishing Company.<ref>{{cite web | author=| year=2004| title=History of the Institution | format= | work=The Mark Twain House and Museum | url=http://www.marktwainhouse.org/about/history.shtml | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> When the house was being built, the Hartford ''Daily Times'' noted, "The novelty displayed in the architecture of the building, the oddity of its internal arrangement and the fame of its owner will all conspire to make it a house of note for a long time to come."<ref name="NYT">{{cite web | author=Charles, Eleanor| year=January 20, 2002| title= In the Region/Connecticut; Visitors' Center to Be Built at Mark Twain House| format= | work=New York Times| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E4D71138F933A15752C0A9649C8B63 | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> The total cost of the house was $40,000, paid out of Mrs. Clemens' inheritance.<ref name="NYT">{{cite web | author=Charles, Eleanor| year=January 20, 2002| title= In the Region/Connecticut; Visitors' Center to Be Built at Mark Twain House| format= | work=New York Times| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E4D71138F933A15752C0A9649C8B63 | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> While in Connecticut, the family remarked "[the house] had a heart, and a soul, and eyes to see us with." 

The house was built on 3.5 acres of land and designed with seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a carriage house, and plant-filled [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]]. [[Bay window]]s extend up to form [[turret]]s that were topped with porches, allowing Twain and guests a view of what was a very pastoral area of Hartford.

The top floor was the [[billiards]] room and his private study, where Twain would write late at night; the room was strictly off limits to all but the cleaning staff. It was also used for entertaining male guests with cigars and liquor. Twain had said "There ought to be a room in this house to swear in" and "It's dangerous to have to repress an emotion like that."

The children had their own area, with a nursery and a playroom/classroom. And Twain played with his children in the conservatory, pretending to be an elephant in an imaginary [[safari]]. Twain noted the house "was of us, and we were in its confidence and lived in its grace and in the peace of its benediction."<ref name="GAM">{{cite web | author=Singer, Stephen| year=June 4th, 2002| title= Twain's house a symbol of his success| format= | work=The Associated Press| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20020406.TRMARK/TPStory/Travel | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> 

Twain loved living in the house, partly because he knew many different authors from his Hartford neighborhood, such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] who lived next door and [[Isabella Beecher Hooker]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite web | author=Charles, Eleanor| year=January 20, 2002| title= In the Region/Connecticut; Visitors' Center to Be Built at Mark Twain House| format= | work=New York Times| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E4D71138F933A15752C0A9649C8B63 | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> Also, he would stop in to visit his friend, actor [[William Gillette]] at Gillette Castle (today [[Gillette Castle State Park]]).

In 1881, with the success of ''Tom Sawyer'', Twain had [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] supervise the interior decoration of the house.<ref name="HGTV">{{cite web | author=| year=2006| title=Remodeling:The Mark Twain House | format= | work=HGTV | url=http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/remodeling/article/0,1797,HGTV_3659_1719037,00.html | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> Twain was also fascinated with new technologies, leading to the installation of an early [[telephone]] in the entrance hall.<ref>{{cite web | author=| year=2006| title=Mark Twain House | format= | work=frommers.com| url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/hartford/A32009.html | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> In that same year, Twain formed the firm Charles L.

Twain began lecturing across the continent to recoup some money for their family, but tragedy prevented their return to the house. In 1893 Twain's publishing company went bankrupt, Susy Clemens died of [[meningitis]] in 1896 after a visit to Hartford, and Olivia refused to ever visit the house again.<ref name="GAM">{{cite web | author=Singer, Stephen| year=June 4th, 2002| title= Twain's house a symbol of his success| format= | work=The Associated Press| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20020406.TRMARK/TPStory/Travel | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> In 1903 the house was sold.<ref name="NYT">{{cite web | author=Charles, Eleanor| year=January 20, 2002| title= In the Region/Connecticut; Visitors' Center to Be Built at Mark Twain House| format= | work=New York Times| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E4D71138F933A15752C0A9649C8B63 | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref>

== Post-Twain ==
In 1905 the house was significantly repaired, but it was also significantly altered, deviating from its original design. This was known to have caused marked uproar among the northeastern Missouri intelligentsia. The chimneys and brick work were also altered. The house was used as a private home, a boys' school, and an apartment building.

In 1929, a group of preservationists &mdash; the Friends of Hartford &mdash; formed the Mark Twain Memorial and Library Commission and purchased the building to prevent its demolition and rented the ground floor to meet expenses. During this period, doors were added to the building, further deviating from the original design. The house was restored in the 1950s and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1963.<ref name="NYT">{{cite web | author=Charles, Eleanor| year=January 20, 2002| title= In the Region/Connecticut; Visitors' Center to Be Built at Mark Twain House| format= | work=New York Times| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E4D71138F933A15752C0A9649C8B63 | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref>

The house was opened as a museum in the 1960s. The process of paying off the mortgage, raising money to restore the deteriorating property, and retrieving artifacts, furnishings, and personal possessions took many decades and ended in 1974, just in time for the 100th anniversary of the house.<ref name="NYT">{{cite web | author=Charles, Eleanor| year=January 20, 2002| title= In the Region/Connecticut; Visitors' Center to Be Built at Mark Twain House| format= | work=New York Times| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E4D71138F933A15752C0A9649C8B63 | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> The house earned the David E.

Restoration and preservation at the Mark Twain House helped bring the house and grounds back to the years between 1881 and 1891, when the Twains most loved the house. The marble floor in the front hallway underwent a historic restoration, and specialists re-stenciled and painted the walls and ceilings and refinishing the woodwork to recover the Tiffany-decorated interiors. Restoration was funded in part by two federal [[Save America’s Treasures]] grants totaling $3 million. Scanning computers were also used in the restoration.<ref>{{cite web | author=Kendall, David| year=| title=The Mark Twain House| format= | work=Antiques and the Arts Online| url=http://www.antiquesandthearts.com/hh/hh1098.htm | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> The home today contains 50,000 artifacts; manuscripts, historic photographs, family furnishings, and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany Glass]]. Many of the original furnishings, including Twain's ornate [[Venice|Venetian]] bed, an intricately carved mantel from a Scottish castle, and a billiard table, remain at the house.

With the number of admissions leveling off around 53,000, the house's trustees decided that they must expand or be forced to shrink their operations. They commissioned [[Robert A. M. Stern]], the founder of the Manhattan architectural firm that bears his name and the dean of the [[Yale School of Architecture]], to design a visitor's center that would not draw attention away from the house.<ref name="NYT">{{cite web | author=Charles, Eleanor| year=January 20, 2002| title= In the Region/Connecticut; Visitors' Center to Be Built at Mark Twain House| format= | work=New York Times| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E4D71138F933A15752C0A9649C8B63 | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref>

The Education and Visitors Center was built adjacent to Twain’s Carriage House. The center is a $16.3 million, 35,000-square-foot facility that will house artifacts from the museum’s collection that cannot now be shown in the House itself. It contains a lecture hall and classroom facilities.<ref name="HGTV">{{cite web | author=| year=2006| title=Remodeling:The Mark Twain House | format= | work=HGTV | url=http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/remodeling/article/0,1797,HGTV_3659_1719037,00.html | accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> The house will receive $1 million from the state government to meet expenses related to the construction of the museum and restoration of the house.
