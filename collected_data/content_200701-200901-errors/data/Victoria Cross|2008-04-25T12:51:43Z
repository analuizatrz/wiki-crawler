The '''Victoria Cross''' ('''VC''') is the highest [[military decoration]] awarded for valour "in the face of the enemy" to members of the armed forces of some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and previous [[British Empire]] territories. It takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals. It may be awarded to a person of any [[Military rank|rank]] in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] during an investiture held at [[Buckingham Palace]]. It is the joint highest award for bravery in the [[United Kingdom]] with the [[George Cross]], which is the equivalent honour for valour ''not'' in the face of the enemy.<ref name=Modclub/>

The VC was introduced on [[29 January]] [[1856]] by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] to reward acts of valour during the [[Crimean War]]. Since then the medal has been awarded 1,356 times to 1,353 individual recipients. Only 13 medals, nine to the British Army and four to the Australian Army have been awarded since the start of the Korean War. The traditional explanation of the source of the [[gunmetal]] from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian [[cannon]] captured at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855)|siege of Sevastopol]]. Recent research has thrown doubt on this story, suggesting a variety of origins.<ref name=Glanfield/> Due to its rarity, the VC is highly prized and the medal can reach over [[Pound sterling|£]]400,000 at auction.<ref name=VCbuy>{{cite web| url=http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/bbshout.htm| title=The Victoria Cross ... awarded to Captain Alfred Shout have been sold at auction| publisher=Iain Stewart, Victoria Cross.org| accessdate=2008-04-09}}</ref>  There are a number of public and private collections devoted to it, most notably that of [[Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]], which contains over one-tenth of the total VCs awarded.<ref name=Ashcroftweb/>

== Origin == 
<!--Section header linked from Victoria Cross for New Zealand -->
In 1854, after 40 years of peace, Britain found itself fighting a major war against Russia. The [[Crimean War]] was one of the first wars with modern reporting, and the dispatches of [[William Howard Russell]] described many acts of bravery and valour by British servicemen that went unrewarded.<ref name=Ashcroft>Ashcroft, Michael, Preface to Victoria Cross Heroes</ref>  

Before the Crimean War, there was no official standardised system for recognition of gallantry within the British armed forces. Officers were eligible for an award of one of the junior grades of the [[Order of the Bath]] and [[Brevet (military)|brevet promotions]] whilst a [[Mention in Despatches]] existed as an alternative award for acts of lesser gallantry. This structure was very limited; in actual practice awards of the Order of the Bath were confined to officers of [[field officer|field rank]].<ref>'''Original Warrant Foreword''': ''{{lang|ang|And, whereas, the third class of Our Most Honourable Order of the Bath is limited, except in very rare cases, to the higher ranks of both services, and the granting of Medals, both in Our Navy and Army, is only awarded for long service or meritorious conduct, rather than for bravery in action or distinction before an enemy,}}''</ref> Brevet promotions or Mentions in Despatches were largely confined to those who were under the immediate notice of the commanders in the field, generally members of the commander's own staff.<ref>British Gallantry Awards, p283</ref>  

Other European countries had awards that did not discriminate against class or rank; [[France]] awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]] (Legion of Honour) and [[The Netherlands]] gave the [[Order of William]]. There was a growing feeling amongst the public and in the Royal Court that a new award was needed to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a man's lengthy or meritorious service. [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] issued a [[Warrant (law)|Warrant]] under the [[Royal sign-manual]] on [[29 January]] [[1856]]<ref name=Ashcroft/><ref name=GazetteOriginalWarrant>{{LondonGazette|issue=21846|startpage=410|endpage=411|date=[[5 February]] [[1856]]|accessdate=2008-01-12}}  The Gazette publishing the original Royal Warrant</ref> ([[London Gazette|gazetted]] [[5 February]] [[1856]])<ref name=GazetteOriginalWarrant /> that officially constituted the VC. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the [[Crimean War]].<ref>Ashcroft, Michael, p.7-10</ref>

Queen Victoria had instructed the [[War Office]] to strike a new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal was meant to be a simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after by those in the military services.<ref name=vvaa>{{cite web | url=http://www.vvaa.org.au/med-vc.htm| title=The Victoria Cross | work=Vietnam Veterans Of Australia| accessdate=2007-06-15 }}</ref> To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, under the guidance of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], vetoed the suggestion that the award be called ''The Military Order of Victoria'' and instead suggested the name ''Victoria Cross''. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion.<ref>'''Original Warrant, Clause 5''':''{{lang|ang|Fifthly. It is ordained that the Cross shall only be awarded to those officers and men who have served Us in the presence of the enemy, and shall have then performed some signal act of valour or devotion to their country.}}''</ref> The first ceremony was held on [[26 June]] [[1857]] where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park.<ref name=Ashcroft/>

It was originally intended that the VCs would be cast from the [[bronze]] [[wikt:cascabel|cascabels]] of two [[cannon]]s that were captured from the [[Russia]]ns at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855)|siege of Sevastopol]].<ref name=beharry359/><ref name=Navalmuseum/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hancocks-london.com/vc_manufacture.htm| title=Hancocks of London History of VC | publisher=Hancocks of London | accessdate= 2007-06-24}}</ref> The historian John Glanfield has since proven through the use of x-rays of older Victoria Crosses that the metal used for VCs is in fact from antique Chinese guns and not of Russian origin.<ref name=Glanfield>{{Cite news |url=http://telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/28/nvc28.xml |title=Author explodes myth of the gunmetal VC |last=Davies |first=Catronia |publisher=[[The Telegraph]] |date=2005-12-28 |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref><ref name=Navalmuseum/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hancocks-london.com/vc_manufacture.htm| title=Hancocks of London history of VC |publisher=Hancocks of London |accessdate= 2007-06-24}}</ref> One theory is that the guns were originally Chinese weapons but the Russians captured them and reused them at Sevastopol. It was also thought that some medals made during the [[First World War]] were composed of metal captured from different Chinese guns during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] but the original metal was used after the war. It is also believed that another source of metal was used between 1942 and 1945 to create five [[Second World War]] VCs when the Sevastopol metal went missing.<ref name=Glanfield/> 

The barrels of the cannon in question are stationed outside the Officers' Mess at the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] at [[Woolwich]]. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 358 oz (10 kg), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment [[Royal Logistic Corps]] at [[Donnington, Telford]]. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, [[Hancocks]] of London, has been responsible for the production of every VC awarded since its inception.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hancocks-london.com/ | title=Hancocks Jewellers |publisher=Hancocks of London| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

== Appearance ==

[[Image:Turner VC f&amp;b.JPG|thumb|The front and back of [[Richard Ernest William Turner|Richard Turner]]'s VC.]]
The decoration is a [[cross pattée]], 41&nbsp;mm high, 36&nbsp;mm wide, bearing a crown surmounted by a lion, and the inscription <small>FOR VALOUR</small>.<ref>'''Original Warrant, Clause 1:''' ''{{lang|ang|Firstly. It is ordained that the distinction shall be styled and designated "The Victoria Cross", and shall consist of a Maltese cross of bronze, with our Royal crest in the centre, and underneath with an escroll bearing the inscription "For Valour".}}''</ref> This was originally to have been <small>FOR BRAVERY</small>, until it was changed on the recommendation of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the VC were brave in battle.<ref name=Navalmuseum>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/collections_special.htm |title=150 years of the Victoria Cross |publisher=[[Royal Naval Museum]] |accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> The decoration, suspension bar and link weigh about 0.87 [[troy ounce]]s (27&nbsp;g).<ref>Ashcroft, Michael, p.16</ref>

The cross is suspended by a ring from a [[serif]]fed "V" to a bar ornamented with laurel leaves, through which the ribbon passes. The reverse of the suspension bar is engraved with the recipient's name, rank, number and unit.<ref name=vvaa/> On the reverse of the medal is a circular panel on which the date of the act for which it was awarded is engraved in the centre.<ref name=vvaa/>

The ribbon is crimson, 38&nbsp;mm (1.5 inches) wide. The original (1856) specification for the award stated that the ribbon should be red for army recipients and blue for naval ones.<ref>'''Original warrant, Clause Two:''' ''{{lang|ang|Secondly. It is ordained that the Cross shall be suspended from the left breast by a blue riband for the Navy, and by a red riband for the Army}}''</ref>  However the dark blue ribbon was abolished soon after the formation of the [[Royal Air Force]] on [[1 April]] [[1918]]. On [[22 May]] [[1920]] [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] signed a warrant that stated all recipients would now receive a red ribbon and the living recipients of the naval version were required to exchange their ribbons for the new colour.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.armymuseumwa.com.au/Refdocs/Foundation%20News%20Sept-Oct06.pdf | title=The Victoria Cross mentioned in newsletter | publisher=Army Museum of Western Australia| date=2006-09-01| accessdate=2007-06-21 }}</ref> Although the Army warrants state the colour as being red it is defined by most commentators as being crimson or "wine-red".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://collections.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.941 | title=The Victoria Cross | work=Imperial War Museum Exhibits and Firearms Collections | accessdate=2006-09-30 }}</ref>

== Awarding the medal ==

The Victoria Cross is awarded for {{cquote|... most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.<ref name=modopshonours/>}} A recommendation for the VC is normally issued by an officer at [[Structure of the British Army|regimental level]] and has to be supported by three witnesses, although this has been waived on occasion.<ref name=Crook204>Crook, MJ, Chapter 18, p.204</ref> The recommendation is then passed up the military [[Command hierarchy|hierarchy]] until it reaches the [[Secretary of State for War]], now known as the [[Secretary of State for Defence]]. The recommendation is then laid before the monarch who approves the award with his or her signature. Victoria Cross awards are always promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' with the single exception of the award to the [[Tomb of the Unknowns|American Unknown Soldier]] in 1921.<ref name=NAMUK/> The Victoria Cross warrant makes no specific provision as to who should actually present the medals to the recipients. [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] indicated that she would like to present the medals in person and she presented 185 medals out of the 472 gazetted during her reign. Including the first 62 medals presented at a parade in Hyde Park on [[26 June]] [[1857]] by [[Queen Victoria]], nearly 900 awards have been personally presented to the recipient by the reigning British monarch. Nearly 300 awards have been presented by a member of the royal family or by a civil or military dignitary. About 150 awards were either forwarded to the recipient or next of kin by registered post or no details of the presentations are known.<ref>Pillinger, Dennis; Staunton, A, p.73</ref>

Originally, the VC could not be awarded posthumously. Between the Indian Mutiny and 1897 and the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]] the names of six officers and men were published in the ''London Gazette'' with a memorandum stating they would have been awarded the Victoria Cross had they survived. A further three notices were published in the ''London Gazette'' in September 1900 and April 1901 for gallantry in the [[Second Boer War]]. In a partial reversal of policy, six posthumous Victoria Crosses, all for South Africa including the three officers and men mentioned in the notices in 1900 and 1901 were granted on [[8 August]] [[1902]]. Five years later in 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six officers and men. The awards were mentioned in notices in the ''Gazette'' dating back to the Indian Mutiny. The Victoria Cross warrant was not amended to include posthumous awards until 1920 but one quarter of all awards for [[World War I]] were posthumous.<ref>Crook, MJ, Chapter 8 pp.68&ndash;90</ref>

In the case of a gallant and daring act being performed by a squadron, ship's company or a detached body of men (such as marines) in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross then a ballot is drawn. The officers select one officer, the NCOs select one individual and the private soldiers or seamen select two individuals.<ref>'''Original Warrant, Clause 13:''' ''{{lang|ang|Thirteenthly. It is ordained that in the event of a gallant and daring act having been performed by a squadron, ship's company, or detached body of seamen and marines not under fifty in number, or by a brigade, regiment, troop or company in which the admiral, general, or other officer commanding such forces may deem that all are equally brave and distinguished, and that no special selection can be made by them, then is such case the admiral, general, or other officer commanding, may direct that for any such body of seamen or marines, or for every troop or company of soldiers, one officer shall be selected by the officers engaged for the Decoration, and in like manner one petty officer or non-commissioned officer shall be selected by the petty officers and non-commissioned officers engaged, and two seamen or private soldiers or marines shall be selected by the seamen, or private soldiers, or marines engaged, respectively for the Decoration, and the names of those selected shall be transmitted by the senior officers in command of the Naval force, brigade, regiment, troop, or company, to the admiral or general officer commanding, who shall in due manner confer the Decoration as if the acts were done under his own eye.}}''</ref> In all 46 awards have been awarded by ballot with 29 of the awards during the [[Indian Mutiny]]. Four further awards were granted to Q Battery, [[Royal Horse Artillery]] at [[Korn Spruit]] on [[31 March]] [[1900]] during the [[Second Boer War]]. The final ballot awards for the Army were the six awards to the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] at W Beach during the landing at [[Gallipoli]] on [[25 April]] [[1915]] although three of the awards were not gazetted until 1917. The final seven ballot awards were the only naval ballot awards with three awards to two [[Q-Ship]]s in 1917 and four awards for the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] in 1918. The provision for awards by ballot is still included in the Victoria Cross warrant but there have been no further awards since 1918.<ref name=Crook204/>

Between 1858 and 1881 the Victoria Cross could be awarded for actions taken "under circumstances of extreme danger" not in the face of the enemy.<ref>'''Warrant Amendment dated 1858-08-10''': ''{{lang|ang|subject to the rules and ordinances already made, on Officers and Men of Her Majesty's Naval and Military Services, who may perform acts of conspicuous courage and bravery under circumstances of extreme danger, such as the occurrence of a fire on board ship, or the foundering of a vessel at sea, or under any of the other circumstance in which, through the courage and devotion displayed, life or public property may be saved.}}''</ref> Six such awards were made during this period - five of them for a single incident (a shipwreck off the [[Andaman Islands]] in 1867).<ref name=Wargravescomm>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishwargraves.org.uk/newsite/medals/Victoria_Cross.htm |title=VC background |publisher=British War Graves Memorial |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> In 1881, the criteria were changed again and the VC was only awarded for acts of valour "in the face of the enemy".<ref name=Wargravescomm/> Due to this it has been suggested by many historians including Lord Ashcroft that the changing nature of warfare will result in fewer VCs being awarded.<ref name=vcfivetv>{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/victoriacross/ |title=Victoria Cross TV programme notes |publisher=fiveTV |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> The prevalence of more remote fighting techniques has meant that the opportunity to carry out acts of bravery are diminishing. Since 1940, military personnel who have distinguished themselves for gallantry ''not in the face of the enemy'' have been awarded the [[George Cross]], which ranks immediately after the VC in the [[Commonwealth Realms orders and decorations|Order of Wear]].

=== Colonial awards ===

The Victoria Cross was extended to colonial troops in 1867. The extension was made following a recommendation for gallantry regarding colonial soldier Major [[Charles Heaphy]] for action in the [[New Zealand land wars]] in 1864.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/H/HeaphyCharles/HeaphyCharles/en |title=Charles heaphy biography |publisher=New Zealand Encyclopedia |date=1966 |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>  He was operating under British command and the VC was ''gazetted'' in 1867. Later that year, the Government of New Zealand assumed full responsibility for operations but no further recommendations for the Victoria Cross were raised for local troops who distinguished themselves in action.<ref name=Abbott230-236/> Following gallant actions by three New Zealand soldiers in November 1868 and January 1869 during the [[New Zealand Land Wars Victoria Cross recipients|New Zealand land wars]], an [[Order-in-Council]] on [[10 March]] [[1869]] created a “Distinctive Decoration” for members of the local forces without seeking permission from the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/N/NewZealandCross/NewZealandCross/en |title=New Zealand Cross |publisher=New Zealand Encyclopedia |date=1966 |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> Although the Governor General was chided for exceeding his authority, the Order in Council was ratified by the Queen. The title “Distinctive Decoration” was later replaced by the title [[New Zealand Cross]].<ref name=Abbott230-236>Abbott PE, Tamplin JMA, Chapter 34, 230&ndash;236</ref>

The question of whether recommendations could be made for colonial troops not serving with British troops was not asked in New Zealand, but in 1881, the question was asked in South Africa. Surgeon [[John Frederick McCrea|John McCrea]], an officer of the South African forces was recommended for gallantry during hostilities which had not been approved by British Government. He was awarded the Victoria Cross and the principle was established that gallant conduct could be rewarded independently of any political consideration of military operations. More recently, four Australian soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross in [[Vietnam]] although Britain was not involved in the conflict.<ref>Crook, MJ, Chapter 19, pp.242&ndash;251</ref>

Indian troops were not originally eligible for the Victoria Cross since they had been eligible for the [[Indian Order of Merit]] since 1837 which was the oldest British gallantry award for general issue. When the Victoria Cross was created, Indian troops were still controlled by the [[Honourable East India Company]] and did not come under Crown control until 1860. European officers and men serving with the Honourable East India Company were not eligible for the [[Indian Order of Merit]] and the Victoria Cross was extended to cover them in October 1857. It was only at the end of the 19th Century that calls for Indian troops to be awarded the Victoria Cross intensified. Indian troops became eligible for the award in 1911. The first awards to Indian troops appeared in the ''London Gazette'' on [[7 December]] [[1914]] to [[Darwan Sing Negi]] and [[Khudadad Khan]]. Negi was presented with the Victoria Cross by [[King George V]] during a visit to troops in France. The presentation occurred on [[5 December]] [[1914]] and he is one of a very few soldiers presented with his award before it appeared in the ''London Gazette''.<ref>Crook, MJ, Chapter 11. pp 117&ndash;125</ref>

=== Separate Commonwealth awards ===

{{seealso|Victoria Cross for Australia|Victoria Cross (Canada)|Victoria Cross for New Zealand}}
[[Image:VCstone.jpg|thumb|150px|Victoria Cross as it appears on [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] headstones.]]
In recent years, several [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries have introduced their own honours systems, separate from the [[British Honours System]]. This began with the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, when the new countries of India and Pakistan introduced their own systems of awards. The VC was replaced by the [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC) and [[Nishan-e-Haider]] respectively, although the new countries continued to permit winners of British honours to wear their awards. Several Pakistani soldiers and officers were authorised to wear both the British medals and the ones earned in the later [[Indo-Pakistani wars]]. Three [[Commonwealth realm]]s: [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]],<ref name=nzgovdept>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/gallantry.html |title=New Zealand Honours |publisher=Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the [[Military Cross]] with their own. Most Commonwealth countries, however, still recognise some form of the VC as their highest decoration for valour.<ref name=gazetteOofP>{{LondonGazette|issue=56878|supp=yes|notarchive=yes|startpage=3351|endpage=3355|date=[[17 March]] [[2003]]|accessdate=2007-11-28}}  The Gazette containing the most up-to-date Order of Precedence</ref>

Australia was the first Commonwealth realm to create its own VC, on [[15 January]] [[1991]]. Although it is a separate award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart.<ref name=ozvc>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/awards/medals/victoria_cross.cfm |title=The Victoria Cross for Australia |publisher=The Government of Australia |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>  Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from <small>FOR VALOUR</small> to the [[Latin]] <small>PRO VALORE</small> This was to accommodate both French and English, the two official languages of Canada.<ref name=CTVVChist>{{cite news| url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070303/victoria_cross_070303/20070303?hub=TopStories |title=Top military honour now cast in Canada |last=CTV.ca |first News staff |publisher=CTV news |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> 
While the New Zealand and Australian<ref name=ozvc/> awards are still made from the gunmetal captured during the Crimean War, the Canadian VC is not, and it is currently made of metal from an unspecified source.<ref name=CTVVChist/>

New Zealand was the third country to adapt the VC into its own honours system. While the New Zealand and Australian VCs are technically separate awards, the decoration is identical to the British design, including being cast from the same Crimean War gunmetal as the British VC.<ref name=nzgovdept/> As of July 2007, only one of the separate VCs has been awarded, to a New Zealand serviceman, [[Bill Apiata]], on [[2 July]] [[2007]], for his actions in conflict in [[Afghanistan]] in 2004. A Canadian version has been cast that was originally to be awarded to the [[Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Soldier]] at the rededication of the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial|Vimy Memorial]] on [[7 April]] [[2007]]. This date was chosen as it was the 90th anniversary of the [[battle of Vimy Ridge]] but pressure from Veterans organisations caused the plan to be dropped.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/article/189029 |last=Teotonio |first=Isabel |title= Vets irate at Victoria Cross proposal| publisher=Toronto Star| date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>

== Authority and privileges ==

As the highest award for valour of the United Kingdom, the Victoria Cross is always the first award to be presented at an investiture, even before [[knight]]hoods, as was shown at the investiture of [[Johnson Beharry]] who received his medal before General Sir [[Mike Jackson]].<ref name=beharry359>Beharry, Johnson p.359</ref> Due to its status the VC is always the first medal worn in a row of medals and it always appears first in [[post-nominal letters]] before any other awards or honours.<ref name=gazetteOofP /> Similar acts of extreme valour that do not take place in the face of the enemy are honoured with the George Cross which has equal precedence but is awarded second due to fact that the GC is newer.<ref name=Modclub/>

There is a widespread erroneous myth that it is statutory for "all ranks to salute a bearer of the Victoria Cross." There is no official requirement that appears in the official Warrant of the VC, nor in [[Queen's Regulations and Orders]] but tradition dictates that this occurs and as such the Chiefs of Staff will salute a [[Private (rank)|Private]] awarded a VC or GC.<ref name=Modclub>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/VictoriaAndGeorgeCrossHoldersTheWorldsMostExclusiveClub.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070609182751/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/VictoriaAndGeorgeCrossHoldersTheWorldsMostExclusiveClub.htm |archivedate=2007-06-09  |title=The world's most exclusive club |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

=== Annuity ===

=== Forfeited VCs ===
:''See also [[Victoria Cross forfeitures]]

The original Royal Warrant involved an expulsion clause that allowed for a recipient's name to be erased from the official register in certain wholly discreditable circumstances, and his pension cancelled.<ref>'''Original Warrant Clause 15:''' ''{{lang|ang|Fifteenthly. In order to make such additional provision as shall effectually preserve pure this most honourable distinction, it is ordained that, if any person be convicted of treason, cowardice, felony, or of any infamous crime, or if he be accused of any such offence, and doth not after a reasonable time surrender himself to be tried for the same, his name shall forthwith be erased from the registry of individuals upon whom the said Decoration shall have been conferred, and by an especial Warrant under Our Royal Sign Manual, and the pension conferred under Rule 14 shall cease and determine from the date of such Warrant. It is hereby further declared, that We, Our Heirs and Given Successors, shall be the all judges of the circumstances requiring such expulsion; moreover, We shall at all times have power to restore such persons as may at any time have been expelled, both to the enjoyment of the Decoration and Pension.}}''</ref> [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] though felt very strongly that the decoration should never be forfeited and in a letter to his Private Secretary, [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]], on [[26 July]] [[1920]], his views are forcibly expressed: {{cquote|The King feels so strongly that, no matter the crime committed by anyone on whom the VC has been conferred, the decoration should not be forfeited.

There are several statistics related to the largest number of VCs awarded in individual battles or wars. The largest number awarded for actions on a single day was 24 on [[16 November]] [[1857]], at the [[Siege of Lucknow|relief of Lucknow]] and the amount awarded in a single action was 11 for the defence of [[Rorke's Drift]] on [[22 January]] [[1879]]. The record for the number of Victoria Crosses awarded in a single conflict was 634 during the [[First World War]].<ref name=vcfivetv/> There are only ten living holders of the VC &mdash; five British, two Australians, three [[Gurkha]]s &mdash; six of them for exploits during the Second World War; in addition one New Zealander holds the Victoria Cross for New Zealand.

An Irishman, Surgeon General [[William George Nicholas Manley|William Manley]], remains the sole recipient of both the Victoria Cross and the [[Iron Cross]]. The Victoria Cross was awarded for his actions during the [[Waikato-Hauhau Maori War]], New Zealand on [[29 April]] [[1864]] whilst the Iron Cross was awarded for tending the wounded during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870&ndash;71.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/V/VictoriaCross/AwardsToImperialServicemenDuringThe2ndMaori/en |title=Awards to Imperial Servicemen During the 2nd Maori War |publisher=New Zealand Encyclopedia |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> New Zealand Flying Officer [[Lloyd Allan Trigg|Lloyd Trigg]], has the distinction of being the only serviceman ever awarded a VC on evidence solely provided by the enemy, for an action in which there were no surviving Allied witnesses.<ref>Ashcroft, Michael, p.296-298, Information on ''Flying Officer Lloyd Allan Trigg''</ref>  The recommendation was made by the captain of the [[Germany|German]] [[U-boat]] ''[[Unterseeboot 468|U-468]]'' sunk by Trigg's aircraft.

=== Victoria Cross after World War II ===
Since the end of the [[Second World War]] the original VC has been awarded 13 times: four in the [[Korean War]], one in the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]] in 1965, four to Australians in the [[Vietnam War]], two during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, one in the [[Iraq War]] in 2004, and one in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] in 2006.<ref name=vcregister/> The Victoria Cross for New Zealand has been awarded once, which was earned in 2004 but awarded in 2007.

The two awards given in the 21st century to British personnel have been for actions in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan conflict]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]]. On [[18 March]] [[2005]], [[Lance Corporal]] (then [[Private (rank)|Private]]) [[Johnson Beharry]] of the 1st Battalion, [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]] became the first recipient of the VC since Sergeant [[Ian John McKay|Ian McKay]] in 1982.<ref name=beharry359/> The most recent award of the Victoria Cross to a British service person was the posthumous award on [[14 December]] [[2006]] to [[Corporal]] [[Bryan Budd]] of [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|3 Para]]. It was awarded for two separate acts of "inspirational leadership and the greatest valour" which led to his death, during actions against the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]] in July and August 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=250538&NewsAreaID=2 |title=Operational Honours: VC and GC for acts of exceptional valour |publisher=MOD press release |date=2006-12-24 |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

== Value of the VC ==
{{wikinews|Victoria Cross fetches record price at auction}}

===Sales of the VC ===

Some recipients have felt the need to sell their medals, often to avoid rows between their children:<ref name=Modclub/>{{cquote|By selling the medal they're taking the problem away. Now that they sell for such a huge sum, it is very difficult for someone to leave their medal to a regiment. The most important thing is that it is on display somewhere to serve as a future inspiration.&mdash;Didy Grahame, Secretary to the VC and GC Association<ref name=Modclub/>}}

The inherent value of the VC can be seen by the increasing sums that the medals reach at auction. In 1955 the medal awarded to [[Edmund Barron Hartley]] was bought at [[Sotheby's]] for the then record price of £300. In October 1966 the [[Middlesex Regiment]] paid a new record figure of £900 for a medal awarded after the [[Battle of the Somme]]. In January 1969 the record reached £1700 for the medal of [[William Rennie]]<ref>''£1700 World Record...'';[[The Times]]; 22 January 1969; pg 12 col F </ref> In April 2004 the VC awarded in 1944 to [[Sergeant]] [[Norman Cyril Jackson|Norman Jackson]], [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], was sold at auction for £235,250.<ref name=AGErecord/> 

On [[24 July]] [[2006]], an auction at [[Bonhams]] in [[Sydney]] of the VC awarded to [[Alfred John Shout|Captain Alfred Shout]] fetched a world record hammer price of [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1 million.<ref name=VCbuy>{{cite web| url=http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/bbshout.htm| title=The Victoria Cross ... awarded to Captain Alfred Shout have been sold at auction| publisher=Iain Stewart, Victoria Cross.org| accessdate=2008-04-09}}</ref> Captain Alfred Shout was awarded the VC posthumously in 1915 for hand-to-hand combat at the Lone Pine trenches in [[Gallipoli]] [[Turkey]]. The buyer ([[Kerry Stokes]]) has indicated that it will be displayed at the Australian War Memorial with the eight other VCs awarded to Australians at Gallipoli.<ref name=AGErecord>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Gallipoli-VC-medal-sets-auction-record/2006/07/24/1153593264537.html |title=Gallipoli VC medal sets auction record |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref>

=== Thefts of the VC ===

Given the rarity of the Victoria Cross and the fact they are rarely sold, these decorations are highly prized on the [[black market]].<ref name=VCstolen/> Several VCs have been stolen and being valuable have been placed on the [[Interpol]] watch-list for stolen items.<ref name=VCstolen>{{cite web| url=http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/aastolen.htm | title=List of stolen VCs | publisher=Iain Stewart, Victoria Cross.org| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

The VC awarded to [[Milton Fowler Gregg|Milton Gregg]], which was donated to the [[Royal Canadian Regiment Museum]] in [[London, Ontario]] [[Canada]] in 1979, was stolen on [[Canada Day]], ([[1 July]] [[1980]]), when the museum was overcrowded<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/history/victoria_cross.htm | title="Victoria Cross: Theft of the VC | publisher=solarnavigator.net| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> and has been missing since. A VC awarded in 1917 to Canadian soldier Corporal [[Filip Konowal]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoukes.com/history/konowal/ |title=Information on Konowal |publisher= Lubomyr Y. Luciuk and Ron Sorobey| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> was stolen from the same museum in 1973 and was not recovered until 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2004/08/23/victoria040823.html |title=Stolen VC back on display |publisher=CBC Canada |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

On [[December 2]], [[2007]], 9 Victoria Crosses were among 100 medals stolen from locked, reinforced glass cabinets at the [[QEII Army Memorial Museum]] in [[Waiouru]], New Zealand with a value of around [[NZD]]$20 million. [[Charles Upham]]'s VC and bar was among these.<ref name=NZHerald>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10479634|title=Army medal theft 'insult' to our nation's heritage|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> A reward of NZ$300,000 was posted for information leading to the recovery of the medals and conviction of the thieves. Lord Ashcroft contributed significantly to this amount. On [[16 February]] [[2008]] New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of the reward.<ref>[http://police.govt.nz/news/release/3701.html Stolen War Medals Recovered]</ref>
A high profile Auckland lawyer, Chris Comeskey, played a key part in the drawn out negotiations to safely return the medals. While there has been much public debate about the need to offer reward money in order to retrieve the medals, there is universal relief that they have been safely returned.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4408597a10.html Why gangland figure got our medals back - New Zealand, world, sport, business & entertainment news on Stuff.co.nz<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Private collections ===

British businessman and politician [[Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]] has amassed a private collection of over 140 VCs. Lord Ashcroft purchased his first medal in 1986 and the collection now contains over a tenth of the medals ever awarded, the largest private or public collection of such medals ever accumulated. The medals are administered by ''The Ashcroft Collection Trust''. ''Victoria Cross Heroes'' by Michael Ashcroft was published in November 2006 by Hardline Books, ISBN 978 0 7553 1632 8.<ref name=Ashcroftweb>{{cite web |url=http://www.victoriacrossheroes.com/collection.html|title=Ashcroft Collection website |publisher=Lord Ashcroft |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

===Memorials===
In 2004 a national Victoria Cross and George Cross memorial was installed in [[Westminster Abbey]] close to the tomb of [[The Unknown Warrior]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=134063 |title= News of Memorial |publisher=MoD |accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> Westminster Abbey is a living monument to British history in that it contains monuments and memorials to central figures in British History including [[Charles Darwin]] and [[James I of England|James VI & I]]. As such it was a significant honour for the VC to be commemorated in Westminster Abbey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/england/london-westminster-abbey.htm |title=Westminster Abbey, a history |publisher=Sacred Destinations guide |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

===Canon William Lummis MC===
[[Canon William Lummis]], [[Military Cross|MC]], was a military historian who built up an archive on the service records and final resting places of Victoria Cross holders.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mdani.demon.co.uk/esjd/page4.htm | title=Lummis cited as 'leading VC researcher'| publisher=Michael Daniels pHd|date=2007-06-15 | accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> This was then summarised into a pamphlet which was taken to be an authoritative source on these matters. However, Lummis was aware of short-comings in his work and encouraged [[David Charles Harvey|David Harvey]] to continue it. The result was Harvey's seminal book ''[[Monuments to Courage]].'' In 2007 the [[Royal Mail]] used material from Lummis' archives to produce a collection of stamps commemorating Victoria Cross winners.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/shop?catId=9300091&pageType=Others&pageId=shp_prddetails&product=prod40680016 | title=The Post Office issues VC stamps in 2007 illustrated with artifacts from the collection of Canon Lummis in the National Army Museum | publisher=Royal Mail |date=2007-06-15 | accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

===Soldiers' club naming traditions===
It is a tradition within the [[Australian Army]] for soldiers' recreational clubs on military bases to be named after a particular Victoria Cross winner, usually one with whom the unit is historically associated. Permission for such naming rights is usually obtained not only from the relevant command hierarchy within the military itself, but also from the family of the VC winner. Once dedicated, the club and its participants typically take great pride in the deeds of the VC winner with whom they are associated, and often family members will be invited to attend certain functions held by the club as a mark of thanks and respect.

Examples of such clubs can be found right across Australia, but more prominent ones include the Edmondson VC Club at [[Army Recruit Training Centre (Australia)|ARTC Kapooka]] (named after [[John Hurst Edmondson]]), the Dunstan VC Club at [[Puckapunyal]] military base in [[Victoria, Australia]] (named after [[William Dunstan]]) and the Arthur C. Hall VC Club at [[Victoria Barracks, Sydney|Victoria Barracks]] in Sydney (named after [[Arthur Charles Hall]]).
