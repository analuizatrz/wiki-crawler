Adherents—usually referred to as ''[[Latter-day Saint]]s'', ''LDS'', or '''''[[Mormon]]s'''''—are [[Restorationism|Restorationist Christians]] and are not a part of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Orthodox Church]] or any of the varied [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions. The Church teaches that sometime after the events depicted in the New Testament, there was a [[Great Apostasy]], or loss of authority to lead Christ's Church, to preach the Gospel, and to administer the [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] (sacraments) of the Church. Because men relied on their own knowledge to understand the Gospel, the fullness of Jesus Christ's gospel was lost from the earth.

[[Jesus Christ]] is viewed as the head of the Church, leading it today through [[revelation]] to the hierarchy of [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] leaders to whom the authority has been restored. The [[President of the Church]], who is considered to be a [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophet]] and an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] guides the Church.

The Church teaches that four authoritative books of scripture contain the word of God:<ref>Articles of [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/a_of_f/1/8#8 Faith 1:8]</ref> the [[Holy Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]].

According to Church teachings, Jesus is the Divine Son of God the Father, delivered to the earth by the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].<ref name="Talmage">Talmage, ''Jesus the Christ'', pg. 90, 1981 edition</ref> It teaches that Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life, that he suffered at [[Gethsemane]] and bled from every pore, was [[crucifixion|crucified]] making an [[atonement]] for the sins of all humanity, [[Resurrection|rose]] the third day, ascended to sit on the right hand of the Father, and will return again.<ref name="pamphlet">pamphlet #3691000 ''The Gospel of Jesus Christ'', pg. 18, published by the Church. English approval 11/05</ref> The Church teaches that Jesus is one with the Father in all things, but that the Father and the Son are distinct beings of flesh and bone, rather than solely spirit.

The Church also distinguishes itself from other Christian denominations by its practice of temple [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]], [[Celestial marriage|eternal marriage]], and teaching that Jesus visited and preached in the Americas after his resurrection, as related in the [[Book of Mormon]].

{{main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
{{seealso|Category:History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}

The LDS Church is overwhelmingly the largest denomination of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and is a continuation of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], established by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] on April 6, 1830 in [[New York]].<ref> The Church was organized April 6, 1830 in the log cabin of [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] in the [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] area, near [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], followed by a meeting the next Sunday in nearby [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the house of [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] Nevertheless, one of Smith's histories and an 1887 reminiscence by [[David Whitmer]] say the Church was organized at the Whitmer house in Fayette. (Whitmer, however, had already told a reporter in 1875 that the Church was organized in Manchester. {{Citation

--> Smith organized the Church soon after publishing the [[Book of Mormon]], one of the faith's scriptures, which he said he had translated from [[golden plates|plates of gold]] that were buried near his house in a place shown to him by the [[angel Moroni]].<!--

The Church rapidly gained a following, who viewed Smith as their [[prophet]]. In late 1830, Smith envisioned a [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|"city of Zion"]] a Utopia type city in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands near [[Independence, Missouri]]. In October 1830, he sent his [[Assistant President of the Church|Assistant President]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], and others on a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|mission]] to the area.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|32}}</ref> Passing through [[Kirtland, Ohio]], the missionaries converted a congregation of [[Disciples of Christ]] led by [[Sidney Rigdon]], and in 1831, Smith decided to temporarily move his followers to Kirtland until lands in the [[Missouri]] area could be purchased. In the meantime, the Church's headquarters remained in Kirtland from 1831 to 1838; and there the Church built [[Kirtland Temple|its first temple]] and continued to grow in membership from 680 to 17,881.<ref>The Deseret Morning News ''2008 Church Almanac'' pg.655</ref>

On July 20, 1831, Smith circulated a written revelation that [[Independence, Missouri]] was to be the center place for the city of Zion.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|57|1-3}}</ref> Though many of Smith's followers attempted to settle in Missouri throughout the 1830s and Smith himself moved there in 1838, the Church faced political and military opposition from other Missouri settlers. The issue of slavery began to affect the members of the Church. Missouri had been admitted into the United States union as a slave state under the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Mormons immigrating to the state from the anti-slavery northeast were viewed with deep distrust. By 1832 it was rumored that Mormons were inciting slaves to rise up against their masters. The article "Free People of Color" in a Church newspaper was interpreted to threaten the slave system, which was the heart of the whole social structure of the state.<ref>Encyclopedia of Latter-Day Saint History pg.1103</ref> After a series of raids on Mormon settlements, the Church formed its own militia to defend its members and the [[1838 Mormon War]] ensued, culminating in believers in the religion being expelled from the state under an [[Extermination Order]] signed by [[Lilburn W. Boggs|the governor of Missouri]].

Eventually the Church purchased new lands and established its headquarters in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], a city they built on drained swampland by the [[Mississippi River]], where Smith served as mayor. There, the Church built a [[Nauvoo Temple|new temple]], and thrived. In December 1840, the affirmative vote of Abraham Lincoln, then serving in the Illinois House of Representatives helped to pass the Nauvoo Charter into law. It gave the city the right to establish the University of Nauvoo, the Nauvoo Legion, a municipal court with power to issue writs of habeas corpus, and a city council with a mayor that could serve as associate justices and chief justice, etc.<ref>Encyclopedia of Latter-Day Saint History pg. 665, 823</ref> At its peak, the population of Nauvoo reached about 15,000 inhabitants.<ref>Deseret Morning News 2008 Church Almanac pg. 221</ref>  This exceeded the population of Chicago, which in the year 1840 was 4,470.<ref>[http://www.censusrecords.net/cities/chicago_census.htm Chicago Census<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
[[Image:Ovalportrait-josephsmith-Carter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] (pictured), founder of the Church, and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were assassinated in [[Carthage, Illinois]] by a [[wikt:mob|mob]] on June 27, 1844]]
On June 7, 1844 an anti-Mormon newspaper called the ''Nauvoo Expositor'' was published in the city. It negatively depicted the religious and political life of the city and angered the local residents who decried its assertions. On Monday, June 10 after 14 hours of deliberation the city council resolved that the ''Nauvoo Expositor'' and its printing office were a “disturber of the peace”, “a public nuisance”, and should be “removed without delay”.   The Nauvoo Legion destroyed the press, type and paper in two hours. Although the event pleased local residents, it angered anti-Mormon sentiments in surrounding communities. Legal charges, arrest warrants, and the incarceration of Joseph Smith resulted.<ref>Encyclopedia of Latter-Day Saint History pg. 824</ref>

Under the promised protection of Thomas Ford, the Governor of the State, Joseph went to the city of Carthage, the county seat of Hancock County, about 30 miles southeast of Nauvoo. While awaiting trial, he and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], who was serving as [[Assistant President of the Church|assistant president]] and [[Presiding Patriarch|patriarch of the Church]], were held in the local jail. On June 27, 1844 at 5:00 pm in spite of the promised protection by Governor Ford, an armed mob was allowed to enter the jail, and shot and killed both Joseph and Hyrum, and wounded Dr. Willard Richards and John Taylor who were in jail with them.<ref>Doctrine & Covenants 135</ref> Two years later the Mormons were forcibly expelled from the state. (On March 24, 2004 the legislature of the State of Illinois issued a formal expression of regret to the Church for the expulsion and delivered it at a press conference at Church headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah on April 7, 2004)<ref>New York Times April 8, 2004.</ref>

After the Smiths' deaths, a [[succession crisis]] ensued whereby a number of Church leaders campaigned to lead the Church. The majority of adherents voted to accept the succession claims presented by the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], led by [[Brigham Young]]. Their claim was based on a March 1844 meeting wherein Joseph committed the "keys of the kingdom" to the twelve apostles with Young as their [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles|leader]].

===Western migration===
After continued difficulties and persecution in Illinois, Young left [[Nauvoo]] in 1846 and led [[Mormon pioneers|his followers]] to the Great [[Salt Lake Valley]] (then part of [[Mexico]] but by 1848 part of the [[United States of America|United States]]) in search of religious freedom.<ref name="emigration-religious-freedom">[http://www.nps.gov/mopi/historyculture/index.htm "Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail: History & Culture"], U.S. National Park Service. "The great Mormon migration of 1846–1847 was but one step in the Mormons' quest for religious freedom and growth."</ref> The group branched out in an effort to pioneer a large state to be called [[State of Deseret|Deseret]], eventually establishing colonies from Canada to present-day Mexico.

In 1850, the U.S. Congress dismissed the State of Deseret plan and instead established a much smaller territory around the Great Salt Lake named the [[Utah Territory|Territory of Utah]]. Young incorporated The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal entity under the laws of the territory. He initially governed his followers as a [[theocracy|theocratic]] leader serving in both political and religious positions.  Negotiations between the United States and the Latter-day Saint hierarchy resulted in a full pardon for the Mormons, the transfer of Utah's governorship from Church President [[Brigham Young]] to non-Mormon [[Alfred Cumming]], and the peaceful entrance of the army into Utah. Young still wielded significant political power as [[President of the Church]].{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

Young was followed by other powerful members, who followed the dictates of their faith in the face of U.S. efforts to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. As the political power of the U.S. moved west, the political and legal wrangling over the polygamy issue escalated. In 1890, Church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] (successor to John Taylor) issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration —|od|1}}</ref> Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, and especially after 1904, when Church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a "[[Second Manifesto]]" calling for all illegal marriages in the Church to cease. Eventually, the Church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy, and today seeks to actively distance itself from “[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]” groups still practicing polygamy.<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>In 1998, President Gordon B. Hinckley stated, <blockquote>
“If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church.” [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=7c86605ff590c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1 Gordon B.

===21st century===
During the [[20th century|twentieth century]], the Church grew substantially. In the year 2000, the Church reported 60,784 missionaries,<ref name=Stats2000>“Statistical Report, 2000,” ''Ensign'', May 2001, 22</ref> and global Church membership stood at 11,068,861.<ref name=Stats2000/> As of 2007, membership had reached 13,193,999.<ref>Deseret Morning News ''2008 Church Almanac'' pg. 655</ref>

==Teachings and practices ==
{{main|Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
{{seealso|Mormonism and Christianity}}

The LDS Church has some teachings in common with [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] traditions, such as a belief that Jesus is the Divine Son of God the Father, delivered to the earth by the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].<ref name="Talmage"/> The Church teaches that Jesus lived a sinless life, and that his suffering at [[Gethsemane]], the shedding of his blood, his [[crucifixion]], his death and [[resurrection]] were sufficient to satisfy the demands of eternal justice and make an infinite [[atonement]] for the sins of all humanity.<ref name="pamphlet"/>  It teaches a belief in Jesus' literal bodily [[resurrection]], and that he currently sits at the right hand of God the Father. The Church's core teachings, circa 1842, are discussed in ''[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)]]'', and delineate the "first principles and ordinances of the gospel" as [[faith]] in [[Jesus Christ]], [[repentance]], [[baptism]] by immersion for the remission of sin, and the [[gift of the Holy Ghost]].<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|4}}</ref>  However, there are also significant differences. Perhaps the most distinct difference between the LDS Church and other faiths is the belief that its founder [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] was a prophet who received a visitation from God the Father and Jesus Christ (known as the [[First Vision]]), and was directed to translate what became known as the [[Book of Mormon]], a volume of scripture that testifies that Jesus is the Christ and stands with the [[Bible]] to testify of this truth.

===Godhead or Trinity===
{{main|Godhead (Latter Day Saints)}}

[[Image:Christus statue temple square salt lake city.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Latter-day Saints believe in the resurrected Jesus Christ, as depicted in this replica of [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s Christus statue located in the North Visitors' Center on [[Temple Square]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]]]] 

The Church teaches that [[God the Father]], [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]] are "one Godhead" but three separate persons:

:a) They are one God collectively, but are three separate beings.  ({{lds|Alma|alma|11|44}})({{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|20|28}})

:b) They are one in spirit, mind, and purpose (agreed in one).<ref>Joseph Fielding Smith, "Teachings," p. 311,372</ref>

:c) In accordance with biblical terms, the LDS Church uses the word "Godhead" as found in the KJV in Acts 17:29; Romans 1:20; and Colossians 2:9. In the Latter-day Saint view of the Godhead, three distinct beings are united in the same sense Christ admonished His followers to be one, united in philosophy, spirit, and purpose with Him, as He states in John 17:11.  Christ is the Son because He was born in the flesh as the Son of the Father. He is also the designated Agent of the Father, the Mediator between Man and God.(John 3:34-35; D&C 93:2-17)  Having received of the fullness of the Father, and able to bind the Father covenantly, Christ becomes the Father of the faithful to those who repent, or are born again of the Spirit, thus being both the Father and the Son, as Mosiah 15:1-5 explains.<ref name="References in text">References in text.</ref>

====Three distinct beings====
The Church's view of the Godhead breaks with [[Nicene]] Christian tradition.<ref name="Jeffrey R. Holland 2007, pg. 40">Jeffrey R. Holland, ''The Only True God and Jesus Christ Whom He Hath Sent'', Ensign Magazine, November 2007, pg. 40</ref> The LDS Church asserts that it is self-evident in the [[Bible]] that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are separate persons, three divine beings as illustrated in the Savior’s great Intercessory Prayer, his baptism at the hands of John, the experience on the Mount of Transfiguration, and the martyrdom of Stephen.<ref name="Jeffrey R. Holland 2007, pg. 40"/> The evidence is further exemplified in Jesus' words, “The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do.”[http://scriptures.lds.org/john/5/19#19] and, “I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.”[http://scriptures.lds.org/john/6/38#38] and "they have … seen and hated both me and my Father.”[http://scriptures.lds.org/john/15/24#24] and, “Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.”[http://scriptures.lds.org/matt/19/17#17] “My father is greater than I.”[http://scriptures.lds.org/john/14/28#28]

=====God the Father=====
God the Father is understood to be the literal Father of the spirits of all mankind.<ref>Hebrews 12:9</ref><ref>{{lds|Abraham|abr|3|21|26}}, {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|93|29}}</ref>  He is also understood to be the Father of Jesus' spirit body and his physical body.

=====Jesus Christ=====
According to the Book of Mormon, Jesus Christ is considered the "the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary."<ref>Mosiah 3:8, ''The Book of Mormon'' p. 152, 1981 ed.</ref>  As the Creator, he is at times referred to as the father of heaven and earth. This is one sense in which he shares the title "Father" with his father. The Church also teaches that those who accept Christ and are baptized are symbolically born again and become the children of Christ.<ref>Doctrine and Covenants 39:4-6</ref>
The Church teaches that through the [[Atonement|Atonement of Jesus Christ]] all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.<ref>Articles of Faith 1:3</ref>  Christ's divinity<ref>Alma 34:10,14</ref> enabled him to take upon himself the penalty for sin and to endure the consequential suffering in [[Gethsemane]] and on the cross that [[Atonement|paid for the sins]] of humanity since the Fall of Adam.<ref>Alma 42</ref> Thus, having satisfied the demands of justice,<ref>Alma 34:16</ref> Christ offers mercy to mankind in two general forms: unconditional (all will be resurrected),<ref>Alma 11:44; 42:23</ref> and conditional (those who believe in Christ, repent of sin,<ref>Doctrine and Covenants 19:16-20</ref> and are baptized, “the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God")<ref>3 Nephi 11:33</ref>  This Atonement however is also believed to cover not only sin, but all pain, suffering, heart ache, or hardship experienced in this life.<ref>{{lds|Alma|alma|7|11|13}}</ref> Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus' status as the son of a mortal woman (Mary) gave him the ability to suffer temptation (yet he did not succumb to it<ref>Doctrine and Covenants 45:4</ref>) and experience physical death; while his status as the Son of God gave him the power to lay down and take up his life again at will. The Church also believes in the physical [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of Jesus' body.<ref>3 Nephi 11:14, Doctrine and Covenants 45:52</ref> Because of its emphasis on Jesus' resurrection and his status as the living head of the Church, the Church does not use the [[symbol]] of the [[Christian cross]] except on the uniforms of military chaplains. Instead, the Church tends to focus on the belief that Jesus overcame suffering and [[death]] and that he lives today.

The Church follows what it understands to be the teachings of Jesus, both in the [[Bible]] and in other scriptures, such as the [[Book of Mormon]]. The Church also teaches that Jesus is the LORD [[Jehovah]] of the [[Old Testament]], and the Holy One of Israel. Because he has the "Divine Investiture of Authority" from the Father, the Church teaches that Jesus Christ often speaks in the scriptures as though he were God the Father, because in so doing he is representing the Father.<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|1|38}}</ref><ref>Talmage, ''Jesus the Christ'', p. 471</ref>

=====Holy Ghost=====
The Holy Ghost is a personage, though he does not have a physical body as do Jesus Christ and God the Father. He is regarded as "a being endowed with the attributes and powers of Deity and not a mere force or essence."<ref>James E. Talmage, ''The Articles of Faith'', p. 159 published 1977</ref> He testifies of the Father and the Son,<ref>St. John 15:26, KJV</ref> and can sanctify people enabling them "to put off the natural man and [become] a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord"<ref>Book of Mormon pg. 153,Mosiah 3:19, pub. 1981</ref>  The Holy Ghost is considered the "comforter" mentioned by Jesus in the New Testament.<ref>{{kjv|John|14:26|John 14:26}}</ref>

=====Other heavenly figures=====
LDS Church President [[Lorenzo Snow]] expressed the nature of the Father in his couplet, "As man is, God once was—and as God is, man may become"—differing somewhat from the traditional Christian idea of [[theosis]]. [[Exaltation]] is a belief among members of the LDS Church that mankind, as spirit children of their Father in heaven, can become like Him.

Official Church materials refer to "Heavenly Parents," implying to some the existence of a [[Heavenly Mother (Latter Day Saints)|Heavenly Mother]].<ref>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=f04a7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 "Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family"], ''Gospel Principles'', 11 (1997).</ref> Belief in such a figure is common among members, and she has been mentioned in meetings by Church officials<ref>See, e.g., [[Spencer W.

===Apostasy and restoration===
[[Image:Joseph Smith first vision stained glass.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] said that he saw two "personages" in the spring of 1820, one of which pointed to the other and said, "This is my beloved son. Hear him!" The Church teaches this was an actual visitation by [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus]] in the flesh.]]
{{main|Restoration (Latter Day Saints)}}
In common with other [[Restorationism|Restorationist]] Churches, the Church believes in a [[Great Apostasy]]. It teaches that after the death of Jesus and the [[Twelve Apostles]], the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] authority was lost and some important doctrinal teachings, including the text of the [[Bible]], were changed from their original form, thus necessitating a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|Restoration]] prior to the [[Second Coming]]. That restoration, according to Church doctrine, began during the life of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]

According to Church [[theology]], the restoration began through a series of visions and revelations, including Smith's [[First Vision]] in 1820, visits by various [[angel]]ic messengers including [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]] from whom he received "the everlasting gospel."<ref>The Holy Bible,Revelation of St. John the Divine 14:6</ref>  It is also taught that he was visited by [[John the Baptist]], [[Moses]], [[Elijah]], and the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]]. Both Smith and [[Oliver Cowdery]] testified that these last messengers came to them while they were together and conferred upon them the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)#History of the priesthood in the Latter Day Saint tradition|priesthood authority]] with its various "keys", so that mankind again possessed the "fullness of the Gospel" with authority to administer in the ordinances thereof.<ref>See The Pearl of Great Price, Salt Lake City, 1981 footnote pg. 58-59</ref> The restoration also included the re-establishment of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] on April 6, 1830. The LDS Church teaches that it is the successor of this Church of Christ, that Smith was the successor to [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and that the current [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President of the Church]] is Smith's modern successor.

===Ordinances===
{{main|Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|Temple (LDS Church)}}
[[Image:Salt Lake temple baptismal font.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|Baptismal font in the [[Salt Lake Temple]], circa 1912, where [[baptism for the dead|baptisms for the dead]] are performed by proxy. The font rests on the backs of twelve oxen representing the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]]]] 

Latter-day Saint [[sacrament]]s are called [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|''ordinances'']], of which there are two types: saving ordinances and non-saving ordinances. All ordinances, whether saving or non-saving, must be performed by a man ordained to the appropriate [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] office, with the exception of certain parts of the temple [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]] and the [[initiatory]] or [[washings and anointings]], in which men and women are separated, and women administer the ordinances for women, and men administer the ordinances for men. However, both men and women must be "set apart", or authorized and "blessed by the laying on of hands" by those who have proper authority before serving as temple ordinance workers.

Saving ordinances are those that are required for [[salvation]] or [[Exaltation (LDS Church)|exaltation]], and include [[baptism]] by immersion for the remission of sins, the [[laying on of hands]] for the [[gift of the Holy Ghost]] ([[confirmation]] of membership in the Church of Jesus Christ), with the "[[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]]" of the Lord's supper, taken each Sunday, to keep in remembrance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to renew the covenants made at baptism, ordination to an office of the [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] (for males), the initiatory or [[Washing and anointing|washings and anointings]], the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]], [[celestial marriage]], and [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|family sealings]]. Each saving ordinance is associated with one or more [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] that the person receiving the ordinance makes with God, and one or more blessing that God promises to the recipient.<ref>Doctrine & Covenants 130:20-21</ref><ref>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.3933737ad2ff28132eb22a86942826a0/?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=13bb9daac5d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____ "Gospel Topics: Ordinances"].</ref>

'''Three primary covenants''' are administered by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints under the heading “new and everlasting covenant,” called “new” because they have been restored again and “everlasting” because they are eternal with God. <ref>D&C 22:1; 131:2; 132:4,6,19,26-27,19-42</ref>   Specifically, they are the gospel, or baptismal covenant; the priesthood covenant; and the marriage covenant.  The latter two are administered in the temple.   Each covenant, or “contract,” between God and Man has one or more pre-requisites, offers one or more rewards, and specifies punishment for breaking it.

The first, the gospel covenant, is entered into after the sincere communicant fulfills the pre-requisite of exercising faith in Christ, repents of his sins, is baptized by proper authority, receives the gift of the Holy Ghost, and promises to endure to the end of his mortal life continuing to exercise faith in Christ and repentance from his sins. He also agrees to stand as a witness for Christ at all times and in all places, and bear the burdens of his fellow servants. (Mosiah 18:9) The scriptures are replete with references to all these gospel elements. (3 Nephi 27:13-22)   The covenant maker receives the reward of the gift of the Holy Ghost,  receives membership in the Church of Jesus Christ, receives forgiveness of sins, peace of conscience, a rebirth of the Spirit ( Mosiah 4:1-13), grace, a hope in Christ, salvation or eternal life, and the joy of the saints. <ref>1 Nephi 11:21-23; Enos 1:3; Alma 4:14; 19:6,14; 26:11-35; 28:8</ref>   The sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, or partaking of bread and wine instituted by Jesus, is in remembrance of this covenant, in remembrance of His blood, or atonement for sins, and His resurrection, or body. <ref>Matt. 26:28; John 6:54; Heb. 9:14-22; 13:12; 3 Nephi 18:1-16; Moroni 4 and 5</ref>   The “milk” of the kingdom of God has to do with learning of and keeping this gospel covenant.   The “meat” is “going on unto perfection,” or entering into subsequent covenants, to obtain a fullness of the life God leads. (Heb. 5:11-14; 6:1-4; John 17:3)   

Latter-Day Saints believe the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is a God of covenants.<ref>Gen. 12:1-3; 17:7,9,19; Deut. 4:25-31; 1 Chron. 5:1-2; Jeremiah 31:9,18-19,31-34; Heb. 7:11-14; Abraham 2:8-11; D&C 86:8-11</ref>   In return for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob’s faith and obedience, God promised them (1) a numberless posterity, (2) a chosen land, and (3) the blessing of all nations through their posterity and the priesthood of their posterity, the “blessings of heaven.”<ref>Gen. 14:19; 22:17; 26:4; 49:25</ref>   God promised Jacob’s son, Joseph, additional blessings, a special land and a righteous branch to be separated from the rest of the house of Israel. (Gen. 48; 49:22-26)    Even later, promises and assurances were given through Moses and other prophets that, even though all Israel should be scattered and many persecuted, the earlier promises would not be forgotten, and a day of restoration and gathering would come in which all the tribes of Israel would be united in peace under the King of kings and Lord of lords.  The Book of Mormon is a witness to the truth of these promises, and it is an assurance that more of them will not be left unfulfilled. <ref>Title Page, Book of Mormon; 1 Nephi 15:12-18; 2 Nephi 3: 6:10-15; 9:1-3; Building Faith with the Book of Mormon by Glenn L. Pearson, SLC: Bookcraft, 1986, p. 25</ref>

The Church teaches there are three rewards or degrees of glory in the heavenly world (1 Cor. 15:29, 40-42; D&C 76:12+), and that to obtain the highest degree of [[salvation]] (referred to as "[[Exaltation (LDS Church)|exaltation]]" in the [[celestial kingdom]]), all people who have lived to the age of eight must participate in each of the saving ordinances. However, the Church teaches that they may be performed for a person either during their lifetime or by proxy after the person has died.<ref>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=0e0a7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 40: Temple Work and Family History”], ''Gospel Principles'', 255.</ref> Therefore, Church members participate in the saving ordinances on behalf of dead relatives and others whose names have been extracted from historical records. The performance of these proxy ordinances are one of the functions of the Church's [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]].

All the saving ordinances are currently open to all worthy Church members of the appropriate age. Prior to 1978, [[black people|black members]] were restricted from some of the priesthood ordinances, but this policy was changed in 1978.<ref>See [[Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].</ref> Celestial marriage is open to one man and one woman at a time, but a [[widower]] may enter a second celestial marriage.

Apart from sealings to parents, the Church does not perform saving ordinances for those younger than age eight or for those who have died before the age of eight (when children reach the "[[Coming of age#Age of accountability|age of accountability]]"), because young children are deemed "alive in Christ" and not responsible for sin.<ref>{{lds|Moroni|moro|8|4|23}}; {{lds|D&C|dc|68|25|27}}; LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=84aa7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 20: Baptism”], ''Gospel Principles'', 129.</ref> Likewise, the Church teaches that the saving ordinances are not required for persons age eight or older who are "mentally incapable of knowing right and wrong".<ref>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=84aa7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 20: Baptism”], ''Gospel Principles'', 129.</ref> They are saved by the grace and mercy of Christ without baptism and will inherit the Celestial Kingdom of God.<ref>Moroni 8:22-23</ref>

Non-saving ordinances include the dedication of graves, the dedication of buildings, the [[Prayer circle#Prayer Circles in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|prayer circle]], the [[Hosanna shout]], [[shaking the dust from the feet]], and various kinds of [[Priesthood blessing|blessings]], including the [[patriarchal blessing]].

===Plan of Salvation===
{{main|Plan of salvation}}
{{See|Mormon cosmology}}
 
The plan of salvation or gospel of Christ is a series of steps, a continuum, or means to come to God through the mediation of the Messiah. It comprises those teachings of Christ which enable a mortal man or woman to overcome the fall of Adam in his or her life, and ultimately return to the presence of God, to enjoy the life of the Great Eternal God, or, more succinctily, eternal life.  The specific teachings include the fact that Adam fell, becoming subject to the temptations of the devil, bringing upon himself and his posterity both physical death and spiritual death, separating himself and them from God. As a remedy for Adam's predicament, consistent with His own nature and objective to produce Divine heirs, God gave Adam and his posterity the moral agency to (1) follow and serve Christ, or (2) follow and serve the devil (Mosiah 16).  To overcome the lasting effects of the fall, Christ offered Himself an infinite sacrifice for the sins of all those willing to repent and enter into a covenant with Him, trusting in His righteousness or merits for salvation (Alma 22:14; Moroni 6:4), while all the rest must depend on their own good works for salvation, or answer the ends of the law themselves, falling short of the glory of God.(2 Nephi 2:1+; Rom. 10:4)  Furthermore, Christ brought about the universal resurrection of all men and women, as they were not responsible for the fall, leaving them to account only for their own deeds in the flesh. ("Articles of Faith," No. 2; Alma 11:41-46)

Also, as the Agent of the Father and Judge of all, Christ is able to be both merciful and just (John 5:22; Romans 2:16).  To obtain His mercy, or be saved from His wrath, or indigation, on the day of judgment, men and women must (1) have faith in Christ, (2) repent of their sins, (3) be baptized by one of His authorized agents in water in the likeness of His burial, to come forth born again of the Spirit, (4) receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, again by an authorized servant of God bearing His priesthood, and (5) endure in faith in Christ and repentance from sins to the end of their mortal lives.  This is the only gospel ever taught by Jesus, and is imparted in the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and most plainly in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, whose purpose is to "convince Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ," as stated on the Title Page. (see also 2 Nephi 25:24-30; "Articles of Faith," 1-13)  

Multiple scriptural names for this limited and oft-repeated body of teachings are: gospel of Jesus Christ (3 Nephi 27:13-22), doctrine of Christ (3 Nephi 11:31-41), plan of salvation, plan of redemption (Alma 11:40-41), words of eternal life (John 6:68), gospel of repentance, gospel of baptism, gospel of salvation, good tidings (Isa.52:7), our report (Isa. 53:1), gospel of the kingdom (Matt.24:14), good tidings of great joy (Luke 2:10), gospel of the grace of God (Acts 2:24), gospel of peace (Rom. 10:15), "good news," and other equivalent names.  Once a man or woman has obeyed the first principles of the gospel, the milk of the kingdom, he or she must press forward, feasting on the words of Christ, going on unto perfection, or seeking the meat of the kingdom, much of which has to do with the temple and a comprehensive understanding of the life God leads.(Hebrews 5:12-4; 6:1-3)[1]

The [[plan of salvation]], or "The Great Plan of Happiness," as taught by the Church, describes humanity's place in the [[universe]] and the purpose of life. The Church teaches that there was a [[pre-existence|pre-mortal existence]], a place which existed prior to mortality in which all people and all life were created in spirit form.<ref>{{lds|Moses|moses|3|5}}; {{lds|D&C|dc|93|29}}</ref><ref>Smith, Joseph Fielding. Bruce R. McConkie, ed. ''Doctrines of Salvation'' (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954 [1972 reprint]) Vol. 1, p. 62</ref>  Central to this is the notion that humans existed as spirits before birth, were raised by Heavenly Parents and had essential human characteristics such as gender.<ref>First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles.  "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" 1995</ref>  This general idea is also stated as "We lived in the presence of God."<ref>Smith. ''Doctrines of Salvation''. vol. 1, p. 56</ref><ref>general idea also expressed in Smith, Joseph F. ''Gospel Doctrine: Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith''. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1969) p. 93</ref>  

During the pre-earth life, Heavenly Father presented a plan to have a Savior make it possible for mankind to be saved. The purpose of an earth life was to give men the opportunity to demonstrate obedience to the commandments of God while outside of His presence. This is the central test of the evolution or eternal progression of man to godhood. Jesus Christ stepped forward as the chosen Savior. However, Lucifer, one of the spirits, proposed a rival plan whereby every soul would be saved, he would receive God's glory, and human [[agency (Mormonism)|agency]] would be eliminated.<ref>See {{lds|Moses|moses|4|1-4}}</ref><ref>Abraham 3:24-28 describes this as well</ref> When God rejected that plan, the [[War in Heaven]] ensued, resulting in Lucifer and one third part of the spirits being cast out and denied ever receiving physical bodies. Lucifer became the devil.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|29|36|37}}, 2 Nephi 2:17 briefly mentions the fall of Satan (Book of Mormon, p. 58 [1982 English edition (Salt Lake City)]).</ref>

The earth, according to Church teachings, was created by [[Jehovah]], which the Church identifies as the pre-mortal [[Jesus]], and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the archangel]], who is identified as the pre-mortal [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. The earth was "organized" from pre-existing [[matter]],<ref>See {{lds|Abraham|abr|3|24-25}}</ref> as were [[extrasolar planets|other planets]] with [[extraterrestrial life|their inhabitants]].<ref>{{lds|Moses|moses|1|29|33}}</ref> Michael's spirit was placed into his body which was created by God the Father and Jehovah, and became a living soul known as Adam.

The Church teaches that at birth, a pre-existing spirit enters a mortal body. Upon death, the spirit goes to a "[[spirit world]]" to await the [[resurrection of the dead]]. There, a preliminary judgment, based solely on whether a person has had a baptism by the authority of the priesthood and received their confirmation, either in this life or after death by proxy, places the spirit in either a state of paradise (has completed all the saving ordinances) or spirit prison (those who have not had the saving ordinances). Those in "prison" will be visited by spirits from paradise and given the chance to learn of the teachings of Jesus Christ and to accept the accompanying saving [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]].<ref>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=6d8b7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 45: The Postmortal Spirit World”], ''Gospel Principles'', 289.</ref> The Church teaches that all persons, wicked or righteous, will be resurrected and receive an [[immortality|immortal]], physical body.<ref>See {{lds|Alma|alma|11|42|45}}.</ref> The nature of that body, however, will depend on the result of the [[Last Judgment]], at which [[Jesus]] will assign each soul to one of three [[degrees of glory]] (heavenly kingdoms): the [[celestial kingdom]] in the presence of the Father and the Son for those who accept Jesus Christ and receive all LDS saving ordinances, either as a mortal or by proxy; the [[terrestrial kingdom]], a place of glory in the presence of Christ for righteous persons who refuse to receive the saving ordinances and for those who do not keep the [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] they commit to; and the [[telestial kingdom]] for the wicked. A further destination, called [[outer darkness]], is reserved for [[Satan]], his devils, and those mortals who commit the [[Eternal sin|unpardonable sin]] and thereby become the [[sons of perdition]].<ref name="Gospel Principles">LDS Church.

===History and eschatology===
The Church's view of history is informed by the faith's scriptures. LDS history begins with the [[creation according to Genesis]], but has never endorsed any particular form of [[creationism]]. Though it does not officially oppose any particular findings of [[natural history]], the Church regards [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] as the first "primal parent of the [human] race".<ref>LDS Church (1909), First Presidency Statement: The Origin of Man.</ref>

According to teachings in the [[Book of Mormon]], the Americas are a special location reserved by God for those who love freedom and [[freedom of religion]]. According to Joseph Smith, what is now [[Jackson County, Missouri]] was the location of the [[Garden of Eden]] and will be the location of the future [[New Jerusalem]], and God has led numerous groups to the western hemisphere in search of freedom,<ref>See {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|1|5|7}}</ref> including several groups of ancestors to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] whose stories are told in the Book of Mormon.

The Church also teaches an expansive view of God's covenant with [[Abraham]], which Joseph Smith taught extends not just to [[Jews]], but to the ancient Church, and Latter-day Saints as well, who in most cases are declared by their [[patriarchal blessing]]s to be either literal descendants of Abraham, or adopted into the family of Abraham through one of the tribes of Israel, often the [[Tribe of Ephraim]]. Native Americans are sometimes declared to be descended from the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] based on the teachings of the ''Book of Mormon'' that some descendants of this [[tribe]], the family of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]], left Jerusalem and crossed the [[ocean]] in a ship about [[600 B.C.]] and landed in what today is called the Americas.<ref>Alma 10:3; Joseph Smith History 1:34</ref>

The Church teaches that in the future, the [[Second Coming (LDS Church)|Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]] will occur, followed by a [[millennium|thousand years]] of [[peace]]. Distinctive within Latter-day [[millennialism]], however, is the idea that Jesus will reign "personally upon the earth" from two locations: one that is presently within the United States,<ref>{{lds|Article of Faith|a_of_f|1|10}}</ref> and Jerusalem in Old Canaan to direct the worship and government or governments that will exist.<ref>Berrett, William E, Teachings of the Doctrine and Covenants, 1956, Ch. 42, p.280</ref><ref>McConkie, Bruce R. A New Witness for the Articles of Faith, 1985, p. 587</ref>  As the earth transitions into the Millennial period, only those good and honorable people who stand to inherit the [[celestial kingdom]] or the [[terrestrial kingdom]] will continue on the earth. During the millennium the Latter-day Saints will continue to proselytize among the living and perform ordinances for the dead. After the millennium will come a final great confrontation of good versus [[evil]], and then the [[Last Judgment]].<ref>Revelation 20:1-3 KJV</ref>

===Theology of family and gender===
{{see also |Celestial marriage|Women and Mormonism}}

The LDS Church has been characterized as a [[family]]-centered religion. The Church teaches that every being that lived upon the earth initially had a [[spirit body]] and that all were born to Heavenly Parents in a [[pre-existence|pre-mortal existence]].<ref name=family>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,161-1-11-1,00.html The Family: A Proclamation to the World].</ref> The Church teaches that on earth, families may be "[[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]]"—meaning that they are eternally bound as [[husband]]–[[wife]], parents–child—and that these bonds will continue after death.<ref>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=c2c97befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 38: Eternal Marriage”], ''Gospel Principles'', 241.</ref> Sealings can also include deceased [[ancestor]]s, providing much of the Church's rationale for its extensive [[family history]] activities. Members tend more often to be married, and have families with more children, than members of other Christian traditions.<ref>Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, [http://religions.pewforum.org/comparisons] [http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/table-status-by-tradition.pdf] [http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/table-children-by-tradition.pdf]</ref>

The Church also teaches that each person's [[gender]] is eternal and that [[gender role]]s are authorized by God. The Church teaches that "By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners."<ref name=family />  Some have characterized this view of the man-woman relationship as "equal but different".<ref>Sonja Farnsworth (1992), [http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/women/chapter13.htm#Priesthood "Mormonism's Odd Couple: The Motherhood-Priesthood Connection"], in Maxine Hanks, ed., ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism'', Salt Lake City: Signature Books.</ref> Nevertheless, LDS women in the [[United States]] work outside the home in about the same [[percentage]] as other American women.<ref>Helen Witney & Jane Barnes (2007), [http://www.pbs.org/mormons/etc/script2.html ''The Mormons, Part 2''] (PBS presentation) ("Mormon women work outside the home in about the same proportions as other American women").</ref> The Church teaches that [[gender]] is inherently linked to sex, but the Church has no official policy on the status of [[intersex]] persons. [[Transgender]] persons are accepted in the Church and may be baptized, but may not receive the priesthood or enter the temple if they are considering or have undergone elective [[sex reassignment surgery]].<ref>''[[Church Handbook of Instructions]]: Book 1, Stake Presidents and Bishoprics'' (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2006) at 41, 78.</ref>

The status of women in Church leadership has remained largely unchanged since the early 1900s. Although they are not ordained to the priesthood, preaching and instruction by women is an integral part of weekly Latter-day Saint worship. Certain leadership positions are filled only by women, and in some of the Church's [[auxiliary organization]]s women may preside over men, such as in the [[Primary (Mormonism)|Primary]], in welfare programs, on activities committees, and at a [[Family History Library]]. Since the 1840s, women have officiated in [[Washing and anointing|certain]] [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] that take place inside [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&index=23&sourceId=8222f73c28d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____  |title= Women in the Church |accessdate=2008-11-25 |work=[http://www/lds.org/ lds.org] |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}</ref>

===Law of chastity===
{{see also |Sexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The Church teaches what it calls the [[law of chastity]], a [[morality|moral]] code that its members must follow to be in good standing with the Church. At its core, the law of chastity prohibits [[fornication|pre-marital sex]] and [[adultery]],<ref>LDS Church (1997), ''Gospel Principles'', p. 249.</ref> which includes [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] sex. The law also prohibits other [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], such as [[masturbation]] and [[bestiality]], as well as mental behavior such as [[lust]], [[sexual fantasy]], and viewing of [[pornography]].<ref>Spencer W. Kimball (1969), ''The Miracle of Forgiveness'', Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, pp. 25, 77–89.</ref>  Emphasis on the law of chastity appears to lead to a lower rate of pre-marital sex among LDS youth in the US.<ref>Christian Smith and Melinda Lundquist Denton,"Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers", 2005 ISBN 978-0195180954, [http://meridianmagazine.com/ideas/images/NatlStudyofYouthandReligionStatistics.htm] esp. Charts of outcomes</ref>

The Church encourages members to enter a [[celestial marriage]], the only form of marriage recognized by the Church as a [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]] and "the only due and proper way of joining husband and wife".<ref>Heber J. Grant, J. Reuben Clark, Jr., David O. McKay (October 1942), [http://search.ldslibrary.com/article/view/191477#191673 "Parenthood: First Presidency Message"], ''Conference Report'', pp. 12–13.</ref> For purposes of the law of chastity, however, the Church presently recognizes only civil unions that are considered "legal and lawful" by the government where it takes place, with certain exceptions including [[same-sex marriage]], [[Polygamy|polygamous marriage]], [[common law marriage]], and other types of non-ceremonial marriages in non-[[common law]] countries.<ref>In the 19th century, the Church performed illegal polygamous marriages, but that practice has been discontinued. The Church is sensitive about its historical relationship with polygamy and entry into a polygamous marriage, even where legal, may result in excommunication: ''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'' (2006), p. 110.</ref>

In countries where celestial marriage is not recognized by the government, it must be preceded by a civil marriage. The Church's teachings are ambiguous about the scope of allowable [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] between legally married couples. Some Church leaders have taught that [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]] are sinful, even as part of a marriage relationship,<ref>"The First Presidency has interpreted oral sex as constituting an unnatural, impure, or unholy practice." - letter from the [[First Presidency]] to local Church leaders, 5 Jan, 1982, Copy located in BYU Library Special Collections, as quoted at [http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/sexuality/sexmarriage.htm]</ref><ref>"By the close of the nineteenth century, the Church had developed a comprehensive, if not systematic and exhaustive set of beliefs and teachings relevant to the subject of fertility control...there was clearly no place within the Kingdom for such "hellish" practices" - Bush, Lester E., Jr.; [http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/dialogue&CISOPTR=5538&CISOSHOW=5431&REC=1 Birth Control Among the Mormons - Introduction to an Insistent Question]; Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Volume 10, Number 2, Autumn 1976; pg 18</ref> but there are no policies on these issues that are enforced in the Church. Sexual activity outside of marriage may result in [[Disciplinary council|Church discipline]], including a possible [[excommunication]], in which a member loses his or her Church membership and privileges but may continue to attend meetings.<ref>LDS Church, ''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'', 2006, pp. 109–111.</ref> In most instances, the Church strongly discourages surgical sterilization as an elective form of birth control among married couples.<ref>LDS Church, ''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'', 2006, p. 188.</ref>

''See'' ''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'' (2006), p. 147.

===Worship===
{{Main|Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The Church provides several kinds of services and gatherings for participation by members and non-members, including weekly services on Sunday, periodic conferences such as the semi-annual [[general conference (Latter Day Saints)|general conference]], and ritual services at the Church's [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] (for members only). All persons, regardless of their beliefs or standing in or out of the Church, are welcome to attend normal Church services and conferences.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/question/worship/1,8578,797-1,00.html Open invitation to attend Church, on Church-maintained website]</ref>  Women usually attend worship services wearing skirts or dresses, while men typically wear suits or dress shirts and ties.

[[Image:LDS Conference Center interior panoramic.jpg|center|thumb|700px|Interior of the [[LDS Conference Center|Conference Center]] where the Church holds its semi-annual and annual [[General Conference (Mormonism)|General Conferences]]]]
The Church holds its normal [[Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|worship services]] on Sunday<ref>Services may be held on a different day when Sunday worship is prohibited by law.</ref> during a three-hour block composed of three meetings: [[sacrament meeting]], which features the Church's weekly [[sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]] ([[Eucharist]]) ritual and sermons by various selected members; [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]], featuring a lesson on various scriptural topics; and finally, each participant is assigned a meeting based on their age and sex, which could include a meeting of priesthood holders for males aged 12 and up separated into age-specific quorums, [[Relief Society]] for adult women, and a meeting of the [[Young Women Organization]] for adolescent females. During the second and third hours, children participate in activities of the [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]]. Periodically, members participate in [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|local]], regional, and general Church-wide conferences in lieu of Sunday services. The [[general conference (Latter Day Saints)|general conference]] is broadcast semi-annually (April and October) from [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. The 2008 general conference was broadcast live through the Internet April 5 and 6 on www.lds.org and was of particular significance in that a new president of the Church was presented for a sustaining vote, in what is called a [[Solemn assembly]].<ref>[http://lds.org LDS.org]</ref>

The Church also provides ritual services at its [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]], which are open only to members of the appropriate age who meet standards of [[orthodoxy]] and worthiness. Members are encouraged to attend the temples regularly, where they usually participate in the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]], [[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]], [[washing and anointing]], and other [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]], most often by proxy for the dead.

===Church member activities ===
{{See also|Perfection (Latter Day Saints)|Law of consecration}}
   
For members of the Church, the greatest commandment is to love God with all their heart and the second is to love others as they love themselves. All other commandments are considered appendages to these great commandments.({{lds|Matt|matt|22|37-40}})  In addition, they have a high degree of participation in religious activities outside of worship services.   Members are expected or encouraged to [[prayer in LDS theology and practice|pray]] frequently (several times a day), perform good works, and read scriptures daily.

Members are expected to donate their [[time]], [[money]], and [[talents]] to the Church, as necessity and responsibility dictates. To be in good standing with the Church, and to enter the Church's [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]], Church members are asked to [[tithe]] their income to the Church, which is usually interpreted as 10% of [[income]]. In addition, members are asked to go without food and drink for two consecutive meals one Sunday per month, and to donate charitable "[[fast offering]]s" (at least the equivalent cost of those two meals), which are used to help the needy, regardless of whether or not they are Church members. They are also encouraged to make other humanitarian donations when necessary, as in the case of an earthquake, tsunami, hurricane, etc. and to assist in relief efforts as they are able.

In addition to attending the weekly three-hour Church services, members are usually given "[[Calling (LDS Church)|callings]]" or assignments in the Church, and often attend various other meetings or activities throughout the week relating to that calling. Members in good standing are assigned to visit the homes of other members monthly as "[[Home teaching|home teachers]]" (men) or "visiting teachers" (women). Members are also expected to engage in missionary work, [[family history]] research, to conduct a [[Family Home Evening]] weekly with their family, and to attend the [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] regularly. Church members are encouraged to live self-sufficiently and avoid unnecessary [[debt]].<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|104|78}}; Benson, Ezra Taft. "Pay Thy Debt, and Live." ''Ensign''. June 1987: p. 3. {{cite web|url= http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1987.htm/ensign%20june%201987.htm/first%20presidency%20message%20pay%20thy%20debt%20and%20live%20.htm|title=Available online|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> All male members are expected to serve a two-year [[Mormon missionary|mission]] at the age of 19, though there are high standards of worthiness and physical and mental health that prohibit many men from serving. Women may optionally serve a mission if they are over the age of 21 and not married, as may older married couples. Women serve a mission for a period of only eighteen months compared to two years for men.

Good standing in the Church requires that members follow the "[[Word of Wisdom]]"<ref>Doctrine and Covenants section 89, originally a strong recommendation, but adopted as a requirement by [[Brigham Young]] in 1851.</ref> (a [[health]] code given by Joseph Smith which the Church interprets as requiring abstinence from [[alcoholic beverages]], [[tobacco]], [[coffee]], [[black tea]], and [[recreational drugs]]). Members must also obey the [[law of chastity]] (the Church's code for [[modesty]] and allowable forms of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]), and are strongly counseled against choosing an elective [[abortion]], except in the cases of a [[pregnancy]] resulting from [[rape]] or [[incest]], a pregnancy that seriously jeopardizes the life or health of the mother, or a pregnancy where a [[physician]] determines that the [[fetus]] has severe defects that will not allow the [[baby]] to survive beyond [[Childbirth|birth]].<ref>''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1:Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'', 2006, p. 185.</ref> In general, members must obey the [[law]] of the [[country]] in which they live and visit, although there have been notable exceptions.<ref>For example, until 1890, the Church advocated [[civil disobedience]] to U.S. anti-[[polygamy]] laws.</ref> The Church discourages [[gambling]] in all forms, including [[lottery|lotteries]].<ref>[http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,89-1-520-21,00.html Gambling]. Gordon B. Hinckley, ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''.</ref>

Church members who commit what are considered serious violations of the standards of the Church (defined as, without limitation, "attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, spouse abuse, intentional serious physical injury of others, adultery, fornication, homosexual relations, deliberate abandonment of family responsibilities, robbery, burglary, theft, embezzlement, sale of illegal drugs, fraud, perjury, and false swearing"<ref>''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'' (2006), p. 110.</ref>) may be subject to [[Disciplinary council|Church disciplinary action]], including disfellowshipment or even [[excommunication]], although excommunication is generally reserved for the more extreme of the above transgressions. Such individuals are encouraged to continue attending Church services, but are not permitted to hold Church responsibilities or offer public prayer at any Church meeting (although personal prayer is encouraged); excommunicated members are also prohibited from paying tithing or fast offerings. Other members are frequently unaware of the status of such individuals.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Ensign |issue=September 1990| author=Russell M.

===Sacred texts===
[[Image:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The [[Standard Works]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints printed in the ''Quadruple Combination'' format, often referred to simply as a "Quad"]]

{{main|Standard Works}}

The Church's [[biblical canon|canon]] of sacred texts consists of the [[Holy Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]]. These are more commonly referred to as the Church's [[Standard Works]]. Though not canonical, many members of the Church also accept the teachings and pronouncements of the Church's [[general authority|general authorities]]—and in particular those of the [[President of the Church]]—as doctrine, and complementing the Standard Works.

The Church accepts the [[Holy Bible]] as the word of [[God]] as far as it is translated correctly.<ref>See {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}} ("We believe the ''Bible'' to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.")</ref> Joseph Smith wrote, "I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers".<ref>''Teachings of The Prophet Joseph Smith'', p. 327</ref> The LDS Church uses the King James Version (KJV) or translation for its English speaking members and other translations to accommodate alternative languages. Joseph Smith did work on [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|his own translation]], but it is only used in conjunction with the KJV. Two extracts of his translation can be found in the Pearl of Great Price, called the [[Book of Moses]] and [[Joseph Smith—Matthew]].<ref>{{Citation|title=[[Church Handbook of Instructions]], Book 1|year=2006|place=Salt Lake City, Utah|pages=174}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Why do Latter-day Saints use the King James (or Authorized) Version of the Bible? | url = http://ldsfaq.byu.edu/view.asp?q=446 | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}</ref> The Church regards parts of the [[Apocrypha]],<ref>See {{lds|D&C|dc|91}}.</ref> the writings of some [[Protestant Reformers]] and non-Christian religious leaders, and the non-religious writings of some philosophers to be inspired, though not canonical.<ref>[http://ldsfaq.byu.edu/emmain.asp?number=202 FAQ about the Church]</ref>

The Church's most distinctive scripture, the [[Book of Mormon]], was published by founder [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in 1830. It is believed to be "another testament of Jesus Christ" and bears that subtitle as of 1982.<ref>see the title page of the Book of Mormon</ref> Smith stated that he translated the Book of Mormon from metal [[Golden plates|plates]] that had "the appearance of gold" that he found buried near his home. His history records:
<blockquote>''At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. On the 22nd day of September 1827, having gone as usual at the end of another year to the place where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger delivered them up to me with this charge: that I should be responsible for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through any neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all my endeavors to preserve them, until he, the messenger, should call for them, they should be protected.''<ref>[[Joseph Smith—History]] 1:59</ref></blockquote>

The '''Book of Mormon''' cannot be lightly passed over, as Joseph Smith said, ''"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion."'' (Teachings of the Presidents of the Church, Joseph Smith, p. 57) 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands or falls, based on the genuineness of that Book.  If it came forth, was translated from gold plates by means of ancient seer stones, from reformed Egyptian, was declared correctly translated by an angel to three witnesses besides Joseph Smith, the plates being seen and handled by still eight other witnesses, and actually was an ancient spiritual record of Christ's dealings with a fallen people on the American continents, as Joseph Smith, Jr. said it was, then he is a prophet. If any detail of his unusual account is false, then he is false. If the Book is true, as millions now believe, then he and his successors are genuine prophets, and the church he established under Divine guidance is also genuine and correct.("Testimony of Three Witnesses and Eight Witnesses" at the front of Book of Mormon; Doctrine and Covenants 84:54-59; Moroni 10:4-5 in the Book of Mormon)<ref name="References in text"/> 

In the Judeo-Christian tradition, including in the courts of the land, a testimony presented by two competent witnesses is considered more convincing than the testimony of one, especially if that single witness is testifying in his own cause.  The Bible and Book of Mormon set forth the Divine practice of furnishing "two or three witnesses" to important Divine acts.(Deut. 17:1; 2 Cor. 13:1; Ether 5:4)  Every religion except that taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has only one witness and that is the religion itself.  Latter-day saints have witnesses from each of two widely separated nations for the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, one book originating in ancient Israel and one in ancient America, and the two testify of the same God and each other.  Those nations produced the Bible and the Book of Mormon, "the stick of Judah" and "stick of Ephraim," which agree in one in testifying that Jesus is the Messiah, the true and livng God of Israel.(Ezekiel 37:15-19; 2 Nephi 3:12; 29:2-14; Isa. 29:11-18; Gen. 48; Jer. 3:18; John 10:16; Acts 10:34-36; Alma 46:24-26; 3 Ne. 10:16, 17; 15:16-24; 16:1-7; 20:22; D&C 3:16; 20:11-12; 42:11-12)<ref>Building Faith With the Book of Mormon by Glenn L. Pearson, Bookcraft:SLC, 1986, p. 57)</ref>
  

As of September 2007, the full text of the Book of Mormon had been translated and published in 77 languages, and selections in an additional 28 for a total of 105 languages.<ref>2008 Church Almanac, Deseret Morning News, Salt Lake City pg.656</ref> The introduction printed with the book says that it is a history of the principal [[ancestors]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|"American Indian"]] peoples.<ref>However, this introduction is not officially recognized by the Church as being part of the divinely inspired canon of scripture.</ref> Much debate has taken place on the subject of whether [[archeology]] supports or denies the Book of Mormon's authenticity.<ref>[http://www.irr.org/mit/bomarch1.html''Does Archeology Support the Book of Mormon?:A Brief Survey of the Evidence''] Institute for Religious Research. 1992</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Ludlow | first = Daniel H. | authorlink = Daniel H.

The Church's [[Doctrine and Covenants]] is a collection of modern revelations, declarations, and teachings, primarily written by Joseph Smith. The [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]] consists of five separate books, including two portions of Joseph Smith's [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|translation]] of the Bible. These five books are [[Book of Moses|Selections from the Book of Moses]] (corresponding to a portion of the Old Testament), the [[Book of Abraham]] (Smith's translation of an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[papyrus]], which includes an account of the creation), Joseph Smith—Matthew (corresponding to a section of the New Testament), [[Joseph Smith—History]] (an excerpt from Smith's 1838 autobiographical writings), and the [[Articles of Faith]] (an excerpt of one of Smith's [[Wentworth letter|1842 letters]] describing Church beliefs).

Accepted informal names include the ''LDS Church'', the ''[[Latter Day Saint|Latter-day Saints]]'', and the ''[[Mormon]]s''.

It also encourages the use of "the Church" or "the Church of Jesus Christ" as shortened references, although "LDS Church" is commonly used within the Church's own publications and the Church officially uses "Mormon" as a descriptive term for itself in the name of the ''[[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]]'' and the website [http://beta.mormon.org ''mormon.org'']. Despite these efforts, the [[Associated Press]] continues to recommend "Mormon Church" as a proper second reference in its ''Style Guide'' for journalists, and the Church itself uses "Mormon Church" on some of its websites.</ref>  The AP Style Guide points out that the term "Mormon" is only appropriately used when referring to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Use of the term "Mormon" would not be appropriate for describing break away sects which are no longer associated with the LDS church.

The Church has organized several tax-exempt corporations to assist with the transfer of money and capital. These include the ''Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', organized in 1916 under the laws of the state of [[Utah]] to acquire, hold, and dispose of [[real property]]. In 1923, the Church incorporated the ''Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' in [[Utah]] to receive and manage money and Church donations. In 1997, the Church incorporated [[Intellectual Reserve|Intellectual Reserve, Inc.]] to hold all the Church's [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s, and other [[intellectual property]]. The Church also holds several non-tax-exempt corporations. See [[Finances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

{{main|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics}}
{{see also|Membership history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The Church reports a worldwide membership of 13 million<ref name = SLT13/><ref name = LDS13/> with approximately 6.7 million residing outside the United States. According to these statistics it is the fourth largest religious body in the United States.<ref>[http://www.electronicChurch.org ''2005 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches''], National Council of Churches. See article by [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001481.html Information Please Database], Pearson Education, Inc.</ref> The Church membership report includes all baptized members and also "children of record"—unbaptized children under the age of nine. (Children are not baptized before the age of eight.) Although the Church does not release attendance figures to the public, researchers estimate that actual attendance at weekly LDS worship services globally is around 4 million.<ref>Fletcher, Peggy.

===Geographic structure===

Church congregations are generally organized geographically, unlike other mainstream Christian denominations. For Sunday services, the Church is grouped into either larger (~200 to ~400 people) congregations known as [[Ward (Mormonism)|wards]], or smaller congregations known as branches. These neighborhood congregations meet in meetinghouses, also referred to as "chapels" or "stake centers" or just ward buildings, located on property most often owned by the Church. In some geographic areas, rental property may be used as a meetinghouse. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a "chapel", the room used as a chapel for religious services is actually only one component of the standard meetinghouse.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/virtualchapel/virtualchapel.html A Church-maintained virtual tour of a typical meetinghouse]</ref> The Church's online "Meetinghouse Locator" can be used to find locations of Church buildings and meeting times.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/worshipwithus Worship With Us]</ref>

Regional Church organizations larger than single congregations include [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]], [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]], [[District (LDS Church)|districts]], [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]], and regions.

==Church leadership==
[[Image:IMG 4991.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Thomas S. Monson]], [[President of the Church|President]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]
The leader of the Church is termed [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President]], and Church members revere him as a [[prophet, seer, and revelator]]. The prophet is believed to hold the same divine calling as biblical prophets, and his responsibility is primarily over the Church as a whole. His stewardship extends over the whole human family on earth as the Lord's mouthpiece. He is entitled to guide the Church through [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]], acting as God's spokesman. The President of the Church serves as such until death. The current president is [[Thomas S. Monson]].

The [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]] and the [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|First and Second Quorums of the Seventy]] are all referred to as ''[[general authorities]]'' because they direct the work of the entire Church throughout the world. The members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are accepted by the Church as [[prophets, seers, and revelators]].

Other Church authorities are referred to as ''area authorities'' and ''local authorities'' and include all other [[Quorums of the Seventy]], [[Mission (LDS Church)|mission presidents]], [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake presidents]], [[bishop]]s, and other [[Quorum (Mormonism)|priesthood quorum]] presidents.

The Church has no salaried ministry; however, general authorities who demonstrate need receive stipends from the Church, using income from Church-owned investments.<ref>Ludlow, Daniel H., Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents, 1948/1993, Ch. 32</ref> All area and local authorities are [[Laity|unpaid]] and continue in their normal occupations while serving in leadership positions.

Although the Church had a paid local clergy in the 1800s,<ref>D. Michael Quinn (1997), ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power'', Salt Lake City: Signature Books, ch. 6.</ref> local and regional priesthood leaders currently serve in a voluntary capacity. Non-clerical Church employees, [[General authority|general authorities]] (who serve life or five-year terms), and [[mission president]]s are paid a stipend from Church funds and provided other benefits. A general missionary fund covers the basic living expenses of single [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]] who are unable to pay their own way. Missionaries and their families are asked to contribute to this fund, and in the United States the missionary's [[Ward (LDS Church)|congregation]] of origin is ultimately responsible to satisfy the monthly obligation to the general fund. Members volunteer general custodial work for local Church facilities.

=== Church hierarchy ===
{{main|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood (LDS Church)}}

The Church has a hierarchical structure, with clearly defined stewardships or realms of responsibility for the various offices. Those who hold such offices do not elect to do so but are "called" by someone of a higher authority in the Church; lower positions are not paid for their service.  General Authorities, The Quorum of the Twelve, and the First Presidency are paid for their duties.

===Priesthood===
The priesthood is offered to all male members ages 12 and older who follow the Church's code of morality. The priesthood is received by [[ordination]], which consists of other priesthood holders [[laying on of hands|laying their hands]] on their head. Ordination to the priesthood is a prerequisite to preside in the Church.

The priesthood in the LDS Church is divided into two levels, the lower priesthood or [[Aaronic_priesthood#Aaronic_Priesthood_as_practiced_in_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints|Aaronic Priesthood]], and the higher priesthood or [[Melchizedek Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]]. Within each level there are various offices. The Aaronic Priesthood offices include [[Deacon (Latter Day Saints)|Deacon]], [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|Teacher]], [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|Priest]], and [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishop]]. The Melchizedek priesthood offices include [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]], [[High Priest (Latter Day Saints)|High Priest]], [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|Patriarch]], [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|Seventy]], and [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]].

===Revelation===
The Church teaches that [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] from God continues today. Accordingly, revelation to direct the entire Church comes to the president; revelation to direct a [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake]] comes to the stake president; for a [[Ward (Mormonism)|ward]], to the bishop; and so forth. Latter-day Saints also believe that individuals can receive personal revelation and divine guidance in raising their families and managing their personal affairs. Because of their belief in modern revelation, Latter-day Saints give significant weight to the teachings of their Church leaders. They revere the words their prophets and [[General authority|general authorities]] speak when "moved upon by the Holy Ghost"<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|8|3|4}}. Members are encouraged to listen carefully to [[General conference (Mormonism)|general conference]] but also feel they can rely on personal revelation in order to appreciate validity of such statements. (see Joseph F. Smith, in Conference Report, April 1902, and [http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1981.htm/ensign%20november%201981.htm/conference%20time.htm Howard W. Hunter] in Conference Report, October 1981.)</ref> as modern-day scripture, and members are encouraged to ponder and pray for revelation regarding the truthfulness of such statements.
[[Image:LDS Baptism Panama.JPG|thumb|right|[[Baptism#Baptism_in_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints|Baptism]] of a girl in [[Cerro Punta, Chiriquí|Cerro Punta]], [[Panama]]]]
Lest someone falsely claim to have received a revelation from God, only those acts and teachings received by ''common consent'' in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are binding upon its members.  Specifically, when a member is accepted by [[Baptism#Baptism_in_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints|baptism]] and [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]] into the Church, he or she covenants to accept as binding upon him or her the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and the pronouncements of the living prophet, or President of the Church, as the word of God, plus everything accepted by common consent up to that time.  Any other teachings are compared for accuracy against those criteria, and may or may not be true, and are not necessarily binding upon the members. <ref>D&C 20:63-66; 26:2; 46:9; 104:21,64,71-72; Standard Works of the Church</ref>

As a principle, Latter-day Saints believe they take the only viable position, all things considered, with regard to revelations from God, given their belief He knows all things (omniscient) and has all power (omnipotent). (2 Nephi 9:20; Jacob 4:8-13)   They certainly believe Man is at an inestimable disadvantage when pitting his knowledge against God’s knowledge.  They believe that in the very best of circumstances, men—clergymen, scholars, researchers, theorists--must reason from the part to the whole, while God reasons from the whole to the part.  Men interpolate and guess, while God knows all things.  Those unacquainted with the Latter-day Saint definition of “revelation” tend to misunderstand their position that any indication of the will of God is deemed a revelation, be it a feeling or impression (Acts 15:28), a dream (Dan.2:3), a vision (Acts 10:3), a voice (1 Sam. 3:4-11), or an angelic visitation (Acts 10:7-10).<ref>Matt. 1:20; Gen. 37:5+; 41:1+; Ether 9:3; Ezek. 43:3; Dan. 8:1-2; JS-H 1:24</ref>   Latter-day Saints believe no one can be saved, unless he or she receives the gift of the Holy Ghost (John 3:5; D&C 16), which is a Revelator by definition, so every interaction of the Holy Ghost with Man is a revelation from God.<ref>John 14:15-26; 15:26-27; 16:7-17</ref>   Latter-day Saints also believe anyone receiving an answer to prayer has received a manifestation of the will of God, hence a revelation from Him.  In fact, all mortals are commanded by God to pray, certainly expecting to receive an answer, if they ask in faith. (Matt. 6:6)<ref>Matt. 5:44; Luke 18:1; 21:36; John 14:13; 15:7; 1 Thes. 5:17; James 1:5-8; 2 Chron. 7:14; Joel 3:32</ref>  Joseph Smith’s claim to a glorious visitation from the Father and the Son was simply an answer to his boyhood prayer, after reading James 1:5-8 in the Holy Bible. (Joseph Smith History 1:17-19)

Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon, is a book containing revelations from God, and can be verified empirically through a personal revelation to the sincere seeker. (Moroni 10:4-5)  In fact, the Book came to light, was compiled, hidden, brought forth, and translated, in such a way that the reader must obtain a personal witness of its truth.  As the “keystone” of their religion, Latter-day Saints believe it proves Joseph Smith and his successors are prophets.  (see above heading: Sacred Texts)<ref>Teachings of Presidents of the Church, Joseph Smith, p. 57</ref>   

One of the most significant contributions of the Book of Mormon is its verification of the little-known and almost forgotten Bible doctrine that Christ was known by every prophet from the beginning down to John the Baptist. (Matt. 11:13; Jacob 7:11-13)   Prophets before the coming of Christ foretold His coming, and those who came after looked back on His coming.  The very spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus. (Rev. 19:10)   This support of the Bible is significant in light of “the making of the modern mind,” especially in the reintroduction and elevation to “religious” stature the old Greek theory of organic evolution.  Scholars in many fields of endeavor have since gotten on the bandwagon to make their disciplines conform to this theory, in direct contradiction to the facts in revelations delivered to them by the prophets of God, ancient and modern.  Latter-day saints believe revealed religion should be the criterion for human reason and knowledge, rather than the reverse. (2 Nephi 9:28-29)   

Latter-day Saints believe there is no true Christian life without continual revelation from God.  It takes revelation from God to be saved.  If we are saved, the Holy Ghost must touch our lives continually. The Holy Ghost is a member of the Godhead, and speaks only the words the Father and Son give Him.<ref>John 14:15-26; 15:26-27; 16:7-173 Nephi 29; D&C 20:6-30</ref>   It takes revelation to be converted to Christ.  It takes revelation to understand revelation.  It takes revelation to recognize another revelation.  It take revelation to have and exercise priesthood authority.  It takes revelation from the Holy Ghost to live the way Christ wants us to live.  It takes revelation to do missionary work.  It takes revelation to run the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom of God.  Every time the Holy Ghost touches human lives it is a revelation from God, because it is a form of communication from God. <ref>Building Faith with the Book of Mormon by Glenn L. Pearson, Bookcraft: Salt Lake City, 1986, pp. 69,73,139</ref>

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are frequently condemned for accepting revelations extraneous to the Bible, upon grounds quoted from the Book of Revelation 22:18-21.  In answer, Latter-day Saints respond that taking-away and adding-to have to do with only the Book of Revelation, not the entirety of Holy Writ.  At the time of Jesus and the apostles, what are now books in the New Testament did not exist as a single compilation, but only as separated manuscripts.  A similar limiting statement is recorded in the Fifth Book of Moses, or Deuteronomy 4:1-2, which would seem to disqualify subsequent writings of the prophets and the entire New Testament.  Furthermore, in agreement with Isaac Newton, the well known English physicist and Bible scholar, Latter-day Saints believe the following books were written after the Book of Revelation: Book of John; Book of Hebrews; First, Second, and Third Peter; and some others.<ref>Observations on the Book of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John by Isaac Newton</ref>  

The scriptures carried and quoted in New Testament times by such as the Apostle Paul were only the Old Testament, yet who today would disallow the supremely elucidating words of God contained in the New Testament?  By contrast, Latter-day Saints believe there is no end to the works and words of the Living God. (Moroni 7:36)  Other statements in scripture allude to this very idea. (John 21:25; 3 Nephi 26:6)  God may command and revoke as seems to Him good at any time. (D&C 56:4-6)<ref>D&C 20:32-36; 58:32; 3 Nephi 11:40; Deut. 4:1-2</ref>  Several works are mentioned in the Bible, which are missing from it, such as the Book of the Wars of the Lord (Num. 21:14), Book of Jasher (Jos. 10:13; 2 Sam. 1:18), Book of Enoch (D&C 107:57; Gen. 5:22-24; Heb. 11:5; Jude 1:14)  The Book of Mormon mentions multiple times three books belonging in the Old Testament, the Book of Joseph (2 Ne. 3:4-22), the Book of Zenos, and the Book of Zenock (1 Ne. 19:10-12), all prophesying of Christ and future events.  The entire Book of Mormon itself purports to be a body of scripture from another nation visited by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.(2 Nephi 28 and 29) (See also above heading: Sacred Texts)

===Auxiliary organizations===
{{main|Auxiliary organization}}

Under the leadership of the priesthood hierarchy are five [[auxiliary organization]]s that fill various roles in the Church: [[Relief Society]], [[Young Men Organization]], [[Young Women Organization]], [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]], and [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]].

The [[Relief Society]] is the Church's women's organization. Founded in 1842 in [[Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]], and with the motto "Charity Never Faileth", the organization today includes more than 5 million women in over 165 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1--43-2-125,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=From Pioneer Group to Worldwide Society}}</ref> Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society.

The [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]] and [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] organizations are composed of adolescents aged 12 to 17. Members often have an additional meeting during the week (referred to as Mutual), which can involve an activity, game, service project, or instruction. The young men and women may meet separately or take part in combined activities. In the United States and Canada, the young men participate in [[Scouting]], including efforts to earn the Boy Scouts religious award for Church members, "[[Religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)|On my Honor]]." Young men throughout the Church also work toward earning the Church's "Duty to God" award. Young women participate in a comparable program called [[Personal Progress]]. Both the young men and the young women are encouraged to live by the standards outlined in the Church's "[[For the Strength of Youth]]" booklet.

The [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]] is an organization for children up to age 11, founded in 1878. It provides classes, music, and activities for children during the second and third hours of the Sunday meeting schedule.

The LDS [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] organization provides classes for adolescents and adults during the second hour of the Sunday meeting schedule. It provides a variety of classes, including introductory classes for new members and nonmembers, and gospel doctrine classes for more experienced members. Adolescents are grouped into classes by age.

===Programs===
[[Image:MormonMissionaries.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Two sister missionaries]]
==== Missionary====
{{main|Missionary (LDS Church)}}
{{see also|Mission (LDS Church)}}
Young men between the ages of 19 and 25 who meet standards of worthiness and preparation are encouraged to serve a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission. Women who desire to serve a mission must be at least 21 and generally serve 18-month missions. Retired married couples are encouraged to serve missions as well, and their length of service varies from three to 36 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/missionary/mormon_missionaries.html|title=Mormon Missionaries|publisher=Light Planet}}</ref>

There are 347 missions and approximately 53,000 full time proselytizing missionaries serving throughout the world.<ref name="currentmembership"/> In addition, about 3,552 missionaries are on special assignment missions, serving as health care specialists, doctors, craftsmen, artisans, construction supervisors, agricultural experts and educators for developing countries and educators, family history researchers and leadership trainers.<ref name="currentmembership"/>

In June 2007, the Church marked the induction of its [[1,000,000|one millionth]] missionary since 1830.<ref name = LDS13/>

====Education====
{{main|Church Educational System}}
[[Image:BYUclarillon.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Brigham Young University Centennial Carillon Tower|carillon tower]] at [[Brigham Young University]], one of several educational institutions sponsored by the Church.]]
Latter-day Saints believe in the value of education. Joseph Smith taught that "the glory of God is intelligence."<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|93|36}}</ref> Accordingly, the Church maintains [[Brigham Young University]], [[Brigham Young University–Idaho]] (formerly Ricks College), [[Brigham Young University Hawaii]], and [[LDS Business College]].

The Church also has [[religious education]] programs. The Seminary and Institute programs are part of the Church Educational System: ''[[Seminary]]'' is a program for secondary school students held daily in conjunction with the school year. The [[Institute of Religion]] and the [[LDS Student Association]] programs serve young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 and those enrolled in [[post-secondary education]] institutions with Church-owned buildings near university and college campuses designated for the purpose of religious education and cultural socialization.

In addition, the Church sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the [[Perpetual Education Fund]]. This fund is designed to benefit young men and women from less developed parts of the world who have served a [[Mormon missionary|mission]], returned to their home, and need further education to become productive citizens in their respective countries. As they finish their education and enter the work force, they then are able to pay back the funds provided so that other individuals can attend both [[vocational]] [[technical schools]] and university.

Members of the Church donate [[fast offering]]s on [[Fast Sunday]] and at other times for the purpose of helping those who are poor or financially struggling. The [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] will meet with a family, or the head(s) of a family to determine whether and how much help they need from the Church. The Church strongly encourages its members to be self-reliant, so these meetings will usually include a plan on how to get the family back on its own feet. This welfare program is not only available to members of the Church, but to any needy members of the community. In fact, the Church has a very broad [[Humanitarian Services|humanitarian effort]], which helps not only those who are going through financial struggles, but also victims of natural disasters or other devastating events. All of these services are paid for by charitable donations and are run by volunteer workers. $104.9 million of aid was given in 2007. 3,974 welfare service missionaries are currently serving in the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/statistical-information|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=Statistical Information}}</ref>

===Finances===
{{main|Finances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The Church has not released Church-wide financial statements since 1959, but in 1997 [[Time Magazine]] called it one of the world's wealthiest Churches per capita.<ref>Biema, David Van. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986794,00.html Kingdom Come]. ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Vol. 150 No. 5, August 4, 1997 (estimating the Church's value at over $30 billion).</ref> Its for-profit, non-profit, and educational subsidiary entities are audited by an independent accounting firm: {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, [[Deloitte & Touche]].<ref>[http://www.lds.org/deserettrust/why.html "Why Deseret Trust Company?"] Accessed May 15, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1995/04/10/00/0000950134-95-000692/Section3.asp Belo Corp Form 8-K.]  Accessed May 16, 2007.</ref><ref>"[http://finserve.byu.edu/files/archives/Handouts/November%202005/Finance%20Section%20Draft%207-Without%20Requirements.doc Financial Planning]". finserve.byu.edu. Accessed May 16, 2007.</ref> The Church receives most of its money from [[tithe]]s (ten percent of a member's income) and [[fast offering]]s (money given to the Church to assist individuals in need.) But tithing and fast offering moneys collected are never spent on for-profit items; they are only spent on building up the church. About ten percent of its funding also comes from income on investments and real estate holdings.<ref>[http://mormoninquiry.typepad.com/mormon_inquiry/2004/10/lds_revenues_an.html Mormon Inquiry article]</ref> 

The Church uses its tithing funds to construct and maintain buildings and other facilities; to print the Scriptures for missionary work; to provide social welfare and relief; and to support missionary, educational, and other Church-sponsored programs.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://lds.org/newsroom/page/0,15606,4032-1---14-168,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=Church Finances}}</ref> 

The Church has also invested in for-profit business and real estate ventures such as [[Bonneville International]], [[Deseret Book Company]], and cattle ranches in [[Utah]], [[Florida]], and [[Canada]]. But these ranches are split between Church Welfare Work ([[Bishop's Storehouse]] and [[Welfare Square]]) for which funds are used from tithing and are not for profit.{{Clarifyme|date=November 2008}} For-profit ranching operations are partially self-sustained but never use tithed money.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

==Culture==
{{Main article |Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by Church doctrine and history, a distinct culture has grown up around members of the Church. It is primarily concentrated in the [[Intermountain West]], but as membership of the Church spreads around the world, many of its more distinctive practices follow, such as following the [[Word of Wisdom]], a revealed health law or code (D&C 89), similar to Leviticus chapter 11 in the Bible, prohibiting the consumption of [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], [[coffee]] and [[tea]], and other addictive substances.<ref>See [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89 ''Doctrine & Covenants, Section 89''].</ref> Because of such prohibitions, the culture in areas of the world with a high concentration of Mormons tends to reflect these restrictions.<ref>Salt Lake Tribune Editorial, [http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619 ''Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse''].</ref>

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of the Latter-day Saint culture.

===Home and family===
Four times a year, the adult women (members of the Church's [[Relief Society]]) attend a Home, Family and Personal Enrichment Meeting (formerly known as Homemaking Meeting). The meeting may consist of a service project, or of attending a social event, or of various classes being offered. Additional Enrichment activities are offered for women with similar needs and interests.

===Social events and gatherings===
[[Image:LSD stake center.jpg|thumb|left|A typical meetinghouse of the Church]]
In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. Mutual (a group for youth of the Church) is held at the meetinghouse once a week, where the youth participate in activities and work on Duty to God, scouting, or Personal Progress. Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve the building for weddings and receptions, or funerals.

===Media community===
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for independent LDS media. The largest of these communities are [[LDS cinema]], [[LDS fiction]], LDS websites, and LDS graphical art like photography and paintings. The Church owns a chain of bookstores called [[Deseret Book]] which provide an avenue for much of this media to be sold. This culture also resides outside of heavily Mormon populations and many LDS bookstores exist near temples where members commonly visit. Some of the titles that have become popular outside of the LDS community are ''[[The Work and the Glory]]'' novels and ''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' movie. There are a number of works that have been successful only within the LDS community. These works generally elaborate on LDS culture or historical fiction in some manner.

The church also has a television station airing on some networks: [[BYU TV]].

==Praise==
The Church has been the subject of praise since its inception. After spending a summer with the Mormons in the early 1870s, historian John Codman concluded that the Mormons in Utah did a better job of ridding their communities of gambling, drunkenness, and prostitution than the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite book |last=Codman |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The Mormon Country.

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of the Latter Day Saint movement}}
[[Image:Mormon Prop8 Protestors.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters in front of the [[Los Angeles California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the Church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]
The Church has been subject to criticism since its early years in New York and Pennsylvania. Criticism at first stemmed from the perceived implausibility of [[Joseph Smith]]'s claim to be a prophet who had been visited by God and angels, as well as questions of the legitimacy of Smith's revelations and the historicity of the [[Book of Mormon]] and [[Book of Abraham]]. The Church's later settlement in western Missouri stoked political turmoil, culminating in the [[1838 Mormon War]]. After the Church relocated to Illinois, religious and political controversy persisted, leading to Smith's [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|1844 assassination]]. As the Church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under Brigham Young during the second half of the 19th century, the Church became the target of nation-wide criticism. After the 1890 and 1904 manifestos and Church president [[Joseph F. Smith]]'s testimony before the U.S. Senate, national criticism of the Church eased.

In the run-up and aftermath to the 2008 Californian referendum on [[Prop 8]], the Church faced criticism from some of its members<ref>http://mormonsformarriage.com/</ref><ref>http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oe-wagenen1-2008nov01,0,593508.story</ref> and gay-rights groups<ref>http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532</ref> alike for its attempts to help ratify [[Prop 8]]. The Church's position on same-sex marriage was made abundantly clear in the build-up to the referendum<ref name="newsroom.lds.org">http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/california-and-same-sex-marriage</ref>. Claims that the Church itself contributed funds to the "Yes on 8" campaign have not been substantiated; however, individual members have<ref name="sfgate.com">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/27/BAP113OIRD.DTL</ref> contributed significant sums to the campaign to ratify [[Prop 8]]. The LDS Church joined other Christian churches and denominations in the effort to pass Prop 8,<ref name="newsroom.lds.org"/> though most of the criticism from media sources was focused on the LDS Church.<ref name="sfgate.com"/>
