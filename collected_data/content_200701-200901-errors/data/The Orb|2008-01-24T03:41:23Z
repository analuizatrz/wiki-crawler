'''The Orb''' are an [[England|English]] [[electronic music]] group known for popularising [[chill out music]] in the 1990s and spawning the genre of [[ambient house]].  Founded in 1988 by [[Alex Paterson]] and [[The KLF|KLF]] member [[Jimmy Cauty]], The Orb began as [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[dub music|dub]] [[disc jockey|DJ]]s in [[London]].  Their early performances were inspired by ambient and electronic artists of the 1970s and 1980s, most notably [[Brian Eno]] and [[Kraftwerk]].  Because of their "trippy" sound, The Orb developed a cult following among [[clubber]]s "coming down" from drug-induced highs.<ref name="guardian-chills">{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Hodgkinson |first=Will |date=[[2003-01-31]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,885369,00.html |title=Chills and thrills |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  The Orb has maintained their drug-related and science fiction themes despite personnel changes including the departure of Cauty and other Orb members [[Kris Weston]], [[Simon Phillips (producer)|Simon Phillips]], and [[Andy Hughes]].  Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as The Orb with the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-[[Germany|German]] producer [[Thomas Fehlmann]].

Alex Paterson prides The Orb on manipulating obscure samples beyond recognition in their albums and concerts; however, his unauthorised use of other artist's work has led to disputes with musicians such as [[Rickie Lee Jones]].<ref name="remixmag-orblivion">{{cite web|work=[[Remix Magazine]] |last=Silva |first=Joe |date=[[2001-02-01]] |title=Living in Orblivion |url=http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_living_orblivion/ |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  During their live shows of the 1990s, The Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media.  Despite changes in their performance method, The Orb have maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert.  These visually intensive performances prompted many critics to compare The Orb to [[Pink Floyd]].

The Orb's critical and commercial success in the UK peaked in the early 1990s with their albums ''[[The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld]]'' and ''[[U.F.Orb]]'', which reached #1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] in 1992.  This success led to their infamous appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', where they showcased their quirky style by playing chess (an interest of Paterson's since his early youth) while the group's single "[[Blue Room (The Orb)|Blue Room]]" ran in the background.  The Orb's mid-1990s albums were met with mixed reactions from UK critics; however, their work received praise from American publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  They experimented with vocalists on their next two albums, which critics generally described as bland and uninspired.  The Orb shifted to the minimalist techno style spearheaded by member Thomas Fehlmann, releasing their new material on the record label [[Kompakt]].

==History==
===1988&ndash;1990: Paterson & Cauty===
[[Alex Paterson]] began his music career in the early 1980s as a [[roadie]] for the [[post-punk]] rock band [[Killing Joke]], for whom his childhood friend [[Martin Glover|Martin "Youth" Glover]] played bass.<ref name="Scotsman">{{cite news|work=[[The Scotsman]] |last=Smith |first=Aidan |date=[[2001-02-16]] |title=A master of the ballistic |page=10}}</ref>  After leaving Killing Joke in 1986, Paterson met future [[The KLF|KLF]] member [[Jimmy Cauty]]<ref name="century">{{cite book|last=Prendergast |first=Mark |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Moby-The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC]] |year=2003 |id= ISBN 1-58234-323-3 |pages = pp. 407–412}}</ref> and the duo began DJ-ing and producing music together under the name ''The Orb''.  Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 [[acid house]] anthem track, "Tripping on Sunshine", released on the German record compilation ''[[Eternity Project One]]''.<ref name="rough">{{cite book|last=Shapiro |first=Peter |title =The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass| authorlink=Peter Shapiro |year=1999 |id=ISBN 1-85828-433-3 |publisher= [[Rough Guides]] |pages=pp. 327–329}}</ref>  The following year, The Orb released the ''[[Kiss EP]]'', a four-track [[EP]] based on samples from [[New York City]]'s [[KISS FM]].<ref name="rough"/>  It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label [[WAU!

Throughout 1989, The Orb, along with Martin Glover, developed the musical genre of [[ambient house]] through the use of a diverse array of [[sampling (music)|samples]] and recordings.  The culmination of their musical work came towards the end of the year when The Orb recorded a session for [[John Peel]] on [[BBC Radio 1]].  The track, then known as "Loving You", was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from [[science fiction]] radio plays, nature sounds, and [[Minnie Riperton]]'s "[[Lovin' You (Minnie Riperton song)|Lovin' You]]".<ref name="amg-peel">{{cite web|work=[[All Music Guide]] |last=Thompson |first=Dave |accessdate=2006-11-06 |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:rh90s34ba39g |title=The Orb: Peel Sessions - Review}}</ref>  For its release as a single on record label [[Big Life]], The Orb changed the title to "[[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld]]".  Upon the single's release, Riperton's management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike.<ref name="Irish-boyd"/>  Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the [[UK singles chart]].  Soon thereafter, The Orb was commissioned by [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] to remix his top 20 single "[[Lily Was Here]]".  The Orb obliged and was soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including [[Erasure]] and [[System 7 (band)|System 7]].  

In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several recording sessions at Cauty's studio, [[Trancentral]].  When offered an album deal by Big Life, The Orb found themselves at a crossroads: Cauty preferred that The Orb release their music through his [[KLF Communications]] label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure that The Orb did not become a side-project of The KLF.<ref name="times-waves">{{cite news |title=Don't make negative waves |last=Toop |first=David |authorlink=David Toop |date=[[1994-06-03]] |work=[[The Times]]}}</ref>  Due to these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name ''The Orb''.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as ''[[Space (album)|Space]]'' on KLF Communications.<ref name="klfcomm">{{cite press release | title =KLF Communications Info Sheet Nine | publisher = [[KLF Communications]]| date = 1990| url =http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=509 | accessdate =2006-10-09}}</ref> Also out of these sessions came [[The KLF]] album ''[[Chill Out]]'', on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.<ref name="generation">{{cite book|last = Reynolds |first = Simon |year = 1999 |id = ISBN 0-415-92373-5 |publisher = Routledge |title = Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture |pages=p. 191}}</ref><ref name="century"/>

Following the split, Paterson began working with Youth on the track "[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]".  They incorporated samples from [[Steve Reich]]'s ''[[Electric Counterpoint]]'' and vocal clips from an interview with [[Rickie Lee Jones]] in which she recalls picturesque images from her childhood.<ref name="slant">{{cite web|last = Cinquemani |first = Sal |url= http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=238 |title = Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld Review |publisher = ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' |accessdate = 2006-10-09 |year = 2002 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051122000926/http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=238 | archivedate=2005-11-22}}</ref>  While Reich was flattered by The Orb's use of his work,<ref name="reich-bn">{{cite web|title=Classical Composer Steve Reich Gets Remixed and Loves It|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/features/interview.asp?z=y&NID=113694 |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]] |author=Martin Johnson |accessdate=2006-10-11}}</ref> Jones pursued the issue in the legal system.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  Big Life chose to [[settlement (law)|settle]] out of court for an undisclosed sum of money for use of her voice on The Orb's recording.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  "Little Fluffy Clouds" reached #87 on the UK singles chart; however, due to Glover's other production obligations, he did not become a permanent member of The Orb.<ref name="amg-bio"/>

In 1991, Paterson invited energetic studio engineer [[Kris Weston|Kris "Thrash" Weston]] to join The Orb.<ref name="melody-93">{{cite news|date=[[1993-03-27]] |title = Pink Floyd Meets The Orb |last = Bennum |first = David |work = [[Melody Maker]] }}</ref>  [[Steve Hillage]], whom Patterson had met while DJ-ing in London, also joined as a contributing guitarist.  Along with producer [[Thomas Fehlmann]] and audio engineer Andy Falconer, The Orb completed several additional tracks for their first album, ''[[The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld]]''.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  At least six studios and twenty outside musicians were used during the three weeks of recording.<ref name="century"/>  Weston's technical abilities and Hillages's guitar work allowed The Orb to craft panoramic sounds portraying aspects of space travel, most notably the launch of ''[[Apollo 11]]''.<ref name="century"/>  ''Adventures'' sold well in the UK and received praise for its balance of ambient music, house music, and sampling.<ref name="amg-adventures">{{cite web|publisher = [[All Music Guide]] |last = Bush |first = John |title = The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld Review |url = http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:4h9sa93gb23k |accessdate = 2006-10-09}}</ref>  Retrospectively, ''Adventures'' is considered ground-breaking for changing the way musicians view sampling and as a seminal work for the genres of ambient and dance music.<ref name="Sunday-adventures">{{cite news|title=Crucial Cuts: The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld |work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |last=Sandall |first=Robert |date=[[2001-10-21]] |page=22 }}</ref>  To promote the release of an edited single disc version for an American release, The Orb embarked on their first tour of the United States beginning in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in October 1991.<ref name="phoenix">{{cite news|work=[[Phoenix New Times]] |date=[[1997-04-30]] |title=Eye of the Orb |last=Holthouse |first=David}}</ref>

[[Image:Live93.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Orb often used bizarre imagery, such as for their live album ''[[Live 93]]'', the cover of which parodied Pink Floyd's ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]'' album cover.]]

In late 1991 and early 1992, Paterson and Weston wrote their next single, "[[Blue Room (single)|Blue Room]]".  Assisting with the recording was bassist [[Jah Wobble]], keyboardist [[Miquette Giraudy]], and guitarist Hillage.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  Despite its playing time of almost 40&nbsp;minutes, "Blue Room" entered the UK charts at #12 and peaked at #8, making it the longest track to reach the UK singles chart.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  The Orb promoted this single with a "legendary avant-garde"<ref name="stylus">{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/brian-eno-and-the-ambient-series.htm |title=Brian Eno and the Ambient Series |last=Weiner |first=Matthew |date=[[2004-09-27]] |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref> performance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' where Patterson and Weston played a game of [[chess]] in space suits while footage of dolphins and an edited version of "Blue Room" ran in the background.<ref name="guardian-breakdown">{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Sullivan |first=Caroline |date=[[1993-04-09]] |title=The Guardian Features Page: Breakdown}}</ref><ref name="Irish-boyd"/>  In July 1992, ''[[U.F.Orb]]'' was released featuring "Blue Room" and, in the US release, The Orb's next single, "[[Assassin (single)|Assassin]]".  Weston integrated his technical and creative expertise with Paterson's [[Brian Eno|Eno]]-influenced ambience on ''U.F.Orb'', combining "drum and bass rhythms" with "velvet keyboards" and "rippling synth lines".<ref name="century"/>  ''U.F.Orb'' reached #1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] to the shock of critics, who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be [[progressive rock]].<ref name="guardian-breakdown"/><ref name="melody-93"/>  Despite The Orb's success, Paterson and Weston preferred to avoid personal publicity and instead allow their music to be the focus of attention.<ref name="independent-pomme">{{cite news|last=Gallivan |first=Joseph |date=[[1994-06-10]] |work=[[The Independent]] |title=POP: Pomme Fritz}}</ref>  Because of this partial anonymity and The Orb's rotating membership, they are often recognised as more of a musical collective than a "band".<ref name="tandt">{{cite journal |last = Tandt |first = Christophe Den |date=[[2004-05-20]] |publisher = [[Routledge]] |url = http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/content/uhyu78vgu3kteu73/fulltext.pdf |title = From Craft to Corporate Interfacing: Rock Musicianship in the Age of Music Television and Computer-Programmed Music |journal = Popular Music & Society |issn = 0300-7766 |doi = 10.1080/03007760410001685804 |pages=139–160 |volume = 27 |issue = 2 |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

Over the next year and a half, Paterson and Weston continued to produce new material, but releases stalled when Paterson began to feel that Big Life was trying to dictate the direction of The Orb's music.<ref name="times-waves"/>  This led to intense disagreements with Big Life and The Orb soon left the label to sign a deal with [[Island Records]].<ref name="citypaper">{{cite web|title=Q and A: Alex Paterson |last=O'Neal |first=Sean |date=[[2001-04-19]] |url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/041901/music.qa.shtml |work=Philadelphia City Paper |archivedate=2005-12-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051208004742/http://citypaper.net/articles/041901/music.qa.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  Their first release on Island Records was the live album ''[[Live 93]]'', which gathered highlights from The Orb's recent performances in Europe and Asia.  It featured The Orb's live crew of Paterson, Weston, producers Nick Burton and [[Simon Phillips (producer)|Simon Phillips]], as well as audio engineer [[Andy Hughes]], who had stepped in previously when Weston had decided to stop touring.<ref name="keyboard"/>  The Orb's first studio production on Island Records was ''[[Pomme Fritz]]'', a chaotic EP noted for its heavy use of strange samples and its lack of conventional harmonies.<ref name="rs-pomme">{{cite web|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |date=[[1994-10-20]] |title=The Orb: Pomme Fritz |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/albums/album/173711/review/5946554/pomme_fritz |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  Though ''Pomme Fritz'' reached as high as #6 on the UK charts, critics panned it as "doodling".<ref name="century"/><ref name="guardian-simpson">{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=[[2001-01-19]] |page=6 |title=The Friday Interview: 'IF YOU PRINT THAT, I'LL COME LOOKING FOR YOU'}}</ref>  Even Island Records "hated it" and "didn't understand it at all", according to Paterson.<ref name="citypaper"/>  Soon after production finished on ''Pomme Fritz'', Paterson, Weston, and Orb contributor Thomas Fehlmann joined with [[Robert Fripp]] to form the group [[FFWD]] as a side project.  FFWD released a single self-titled album on Paterson's [[Inter-Modo]] label, which Fehlmann later described as "an Orb track which became so long that it became a whole album!".<ref name="century"/>  Due to this aimlessness, FFWD lacked an artistic goal and disbanded after a single release.<ref name="century"/>  Soon after the release of ''FFWD'' in August 1994, Weston suddenly quit The Orb. Paterson claimed that Weston's departure was due to Weston's desire to have more control in The Orb.<ref name="keyboard"/>  However, in an interview with ''[[i-D]]'', Weston attributed the split to Paterson, saying that Paterson "didn't do his 50 per cent of the work."<ref name="guardian-simpson"/>  Paterson reaffirmed the status of The Orb saying, "The Orb is The Orb, and nothing can change that" and continued work with Hughes and Fehlmann.<ref name="independent-earth">{{cite news|last=Prendergast |first=Mark |work=[[The Independent]] |date=[[1995-03-17]] |page=34 |title=Earth Calling Orb, Come In}}</ref>

===1995&ndash;2001: Paterson, Fehlmann & Hughes===
Following Weston's departure from The Orb, Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member, though he would not always participate in live performances. Paterson, Hughes, and Fehlmann then finished producing the album ''[[Orbus Terrarum]]'', on which Paterson and Weston had been working.

Paterson and Fehlmann, along with usual collaborators Hughes, Burton, and Phillips, wrote and produced ''[[Cydonia (album)|Cydonia]]'' for a planned 1999 release.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  Featured on the album were appearances from Robert Fripp, [[John Roome]] (Witchman), and Fil Le Gonidec, one of The Orb's live performers.  Singers Nina Walsh and Aki Omori appeared on two tracks each, providing vocals and co-writing lyrics with Paterson.

[[Image:Badorb.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Paterson's record label [[Badorb.com]] had only fourteen releases in its brief existence.]]
In 2001, Alex Paterson formed the record label [[Badorb.com]] as an outlet for Orb members' side projects.

The Orb, now composed of Paterson, Phillips and Fehlmannn, with guest John Roome, accepted an invitation to join the [[Area:One]] concert tour with [[Moby]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], and other alternative and electronic artists.<ref name="mtv-area">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443083/04232001/moby.jhtml#/news/articles/1443083/04232001/moby.jhtml |title=Area:One Festival's Details Come Into Focus |date=[[2001-04-23]] |last=Reimer |first=Courtney |publisher=[[MTV]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040606125600/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443083/04232001/moby.jhtml |archivedate = 2004-06-06 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  Though The Orb was paired with more mainstream artists during the tour such as [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], Paterson and Fehlmann chose to make their next releases a series of several low-key EPs for German label [[Kompakt]] in 2002.

==Themes and influences==
===Inspiration===
The Orb's members have drawn from an assortment of influences in their music.<ref name="ps-aubrey">{{cite web|title=Auntie Aubrey's Excursions Beyond the Call of Duty Part 2 Review |last=Hart |first=Vince |date=[[2002-04-01]] |url=http://www.progressive-sounds.com/Music-Reviews/orb-aunt-aubries-excursions.asp |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  The Orb's central figure, Alex Paterson, had early musical tastes and influences which included [[King Tubby]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Kraftwerk]], and [[T.Rex (band)|T.Rex]].<ref name="ra-interview">{{cite web|title=Dr Alex Paterson - music as medicine| url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature_view.asp?id=444 |last = Jarvis |first=Matt |coauthor=Helen Hayden |publisher=[[Resident Advisor]] |date=[[2004-03-30]] |archivedate=2005-03-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050301035432/http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature_view.asp?id=444 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  Among these, Paterson cites Kraftwerk as one of the most important, claiming they created the foundation from which all modern dance music has been built.<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  While in [[Brixton]] with Martin Glover as a teenager, Paterson was also exposed to a large amount of reggae music, such as [[The Mighty Diamonds]], [[The Abyssinians]], and [[Bob Marley]].<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  The reggae influence on Paterson and The Orb can readily be heard in tracks such as the single "Perpetual Dawn" and ''U.F.Orb'''s "Towers of Dub".  The earliest ambient influences of The Orb came in 1979 during Paterson's roadie days with Killing Joke.  While with the band in [[Neuss]], Paterson listened to Brian Eno's ''[[Music for Films]]'' while on [[LSD]] and watched "the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] steel works explode in the distance", noting that "[t]he scene seemed to be taking place in the music as well".<ref name="century"/>  That same night, Paterson was also inspired while listening to [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]]'s ''[[Grosses Wasser]]'' and found that the steel works' "huge metal arms were crushing molten rocks in time to the music", which was something he'd "never seen, or heard, anything like it before".<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  Along with Cluster and Kraftwerk, Paterson was also influenced by other German experimental music from [[Can (band)|Can]] and composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].<ref name="keyboard"/>  ''[[Modulations]]'' calls Paterson's music a "maximal" version of Brian Eno's "minimal" ambience,<ref name="modulations">{{cite book|editor=[[Peter Shapiro|Shapiro, Peter]] (ed.) |title=[[Modulations|Modulations - A History of Electronic Music: Throbbing Words on Sound]] |publisher=Caipirinha Productions |year=2000 |id= ISBN 1-891024-06-X |pages = pp. 160–162}}</ref> though according to Paterson, Eno resents Paterson's use of his music as an influence.<ref name="metropolis" />

The Orb has often been described as "The Pink Floyd of the Nineties",<ref name=guardian-spencer>{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[1994-06-05]] |last=Spencer |first=Neil |title=Neil Spencer meets their inspirational founder, Alex Paterson}}</ref> however, Paterson has stated that The Orb's music is more influenced by experimental electronic music more so than progressive rock of the 1970s.<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  He has noted though that the Pink Floyd album [[Meddle (album)|Meddle]] was influential to him as a child in the 1960s.<ref name="melody-93"/>  The psychedelic prog-rock similarities have led critics to describe The Orb as [[hippie]] revivalists;<ref name="birmingham-adventures">{{cite news|work=[[Birmingham Post]] |last=Cowen |first=Andrew |date=[[2001-02-10]] |title=CD Reviews: Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld |page=4}}</ref> however, Paterson has strongly rejected the tag, claiming that even as a youth, he was "one of those punks who hated hippies".<ref name="times-hippie">{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] |last=Sandall |first=Robert |date=[[1992-07-12]] |title=Hippie dippie draw: Orb}}</ref> 

During production of ''Cydonia'' and ''Bicycles & Tricycles'', Paterson's biggest influences were [[drum and bass]] and [[trip hop]] music, as seen on the tracks "Ghostdancing", "Thursday's Keeper", and "Aftermath".<ref name="birmingham-guru">{{cite news|title=Ambient gurus refuse to lie down |work=[[Birmingham Post]] |date=[[1998-10-21]] |page=15 |last=Cowen |first=Andrew}}</ref>  The Orb's more recent influences consist largely of German techno producers, such as [[Triola (producer)|Triola]], who themselves were inspired by The Orb's earlier work.<ref name="amg-okie"/>  Paterson cites the music of Kompakt as one of his primary modern influences and claims it to be among the best modern ambient music.<ref name="independent-top10">{{cite news|work=[[The Independent]] |last=Paterson |first=Alex |page=16 |date=[[2004-05-07]] |title=The Ten Best Ambient Works}}</ref>

===Drug use===
As chill out DJs in the late 1980s, The Orb often played to the needs of "the chemical generation" ([[ravers]] of the 1980s and 1990s), making music "to come down from drugs to".<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  Paterson described The Orb's original intent as "basically about taking lots of drugs and going clubbing."<ref name="keyboard"/>  Similarly, one of The Orb's early taglines was "Ambient house for the [[ecstasy (drug)|E generation]]".<ref name="rough"/>  Often during interviews, Alex Paterson will smoke [[joint (cannabis)|joint]]s,<ref name="ocean"/> including a 2003 interview with ''The Guardian'', where interviewer Will Hodgkinson noted the assorted "[[hashish|hash]]-smoking paraphernalia" around Paterson's [[Battersea]] apartment.<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  Drug references often turn up in tracks, such as "72" from ''Orblivion'', which features a clip from [[Hair (musical)|Hair]] proclaiming "the youth of America on [[LSD]]!".  Another notable case is on "Little Fluffy Clouds", where the odd nasal tonality of [[Rickie Lee Jones]]' voice is sometimes attributed to drug use, though Jones claimed that it was the result of a heavy cold.<ref name="cdtimes">{{cite web|work=CD Times |url=http://www.cdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=81 |title=The Orb - Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld |date=[[2003-10-15]] |last=McCusker |first=Eamonn |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060315153349/http://www.cdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=81 |archivedate=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref><!--The Orb's drug references are often more explicit, as in The Orb's music is the single "Aftermath", where MC Soom-T raps about [[marijuana]] and its use. (can't seem to find the source for this right now)-->

===Imagery===
[[Image:OrbColors.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Orb's performances are noted for the use of psychedelic and science fiction images.]]
Imagery has always been an important part of The Orb's persona.<ref name="toop-live">{{cite news|title=Live and on the record |work=[[The Times]] |date=[[1992-10-28]] |last=Toop |first=David |authorlink = David Toop}}</ref>  This is most prominent during live performances, where The Orb often projects surreal images against onstage screens.  Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and ubiquitous alien references.<ref name="rollingstone-live97">{{cite news|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |title=Review of the Hammerstein Ballroom, NY live show |date=[[1997-05-09]] |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/articles/story/5925017/the_orb}}</ref>  They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs.<ref name="birmingham-guru"/>  This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins.  Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, The Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also experimented with in-show imagery and films.<ref name="rollingstone-live97"/>  Paterson cites [[Godfrey Reggio]]'s and [[Philip Glass]]'s film [[Koyaanisqatsi]] as a primary influence to their concert imagery.<ref name="option-97"/>

The Orb is also been noted for their original album art, which features much of the same imagery as their live act.  Noted graphic design group [[The Designers Republic]] created the cover art for The Orb's earlier work, including ''Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'', ''U.F.Orb'', and the singles from those two albums.<ref name="backside">{{cite web|title=Orb:Albums|url=http://www.backsideoftheorb.com/index.php?view=albums|accessdate=2007-03-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060529002106/http://www.backsideoftheorb.com/index.php?view=albums |archivedate=2006-05-29 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  For their next album, The Orb poked fun at their Pink Floyd comparisons with the cover of ''Live 93'' featuring a floating stuffed sheep over the [[Battersea Power Station]], which had appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd's ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]''.<ref name="JAM">{{cite news|work=JAM (Florida Music Magazine) |date=[[1995-04-26]] |title=Alex Paterson Interview}}</ref>  The artwork found in Badorb.com releases was similar to The Orb's odd artwork of the mid-1990s, as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing.<ref name="citypaper"/>  Paterson has also dabbled in the creation of cover art himself, designing the cover of ''Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt''.<ref name="discogs-okie">{{cite web|title=Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/547681 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=2006-11-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060503112148/http://www.discogs.com/release/547681 |archivedate=2006-05-03}}</ref>

===Science fiction and space===
Some of the more prominent motifs in The Orb's work are outer space and science fiction, including alien visitations, [[space flight]], and [[mind control]].  These have included The Orb's use of samples from serious sources such as [[NASA]] transmissions to comedic clips from films like [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Sleeper (film)|Sleeper]]''.  ''U.F.Orb'' especially expressed a fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the album's title itself.<ref name="phoenix"/>  The title of its most popular single, "Blue Room", is itself a reference to the supposed Blue Room of [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], which was heavily investigated as a possible UFO evidence holding room.<ref name="times-hippie"/>  Their 2001 album, too, is named for a space-related subject, specifically the [[Cydonia Mensae]] region of Mars.<ref name="remixmag-orblivion"/>  Due to Paterson's focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena, ''The Guardian'' described Paterson as "pop [music]'s primary spokesperson on aliens".<ref name="guardian-simpson"/>

==Techniques, technology, live performances==
[[Image:OrbDisney.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Alex Paterson|Paterson]] and [[Thomas Fehlmann|Fehlmann]] at a 2006 performance at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]].]]
In The Orb's early DJ events in the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty performed with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player all of which were mixed through an [[Akai]] 12-track [[mixing console|mixer]].<ref name="shih"/>  They used their equipment to harmonise recorded music and sound effect samples into an "endless sound continuum" for audiences of worn out dancers.<ref name="century"/>  Even after The Orb began producing original material, they kept the same sample-heavy model for live acts by spontaneously integrating obscure samples into their pre-recorded tracks.  During promotional tours for ''Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'' and ''U.F.Orb'', The Orb performed using a [[digital audio tape]] machine and experimented with other media sources such as [[dubplate]]s.  The tape machines held individual chords, rhythms, and basslines for each composition, allowing The Orb to reprocess them and mimic the act of DJ-ing.<ref name="tandt"/>  Members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect [[amp rack|rack]]s.<ref name="keyboard"/>  Often, The Orb had a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar.  Their shows in the early 1990s would often be three hours of semi-improvised, continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples, voices, and pre-recorded tracks which were barely identifiable as the original piece.<ref name="times-anything">{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] |last=Gray |first=Louise |date=[[1993-11-18]] |title=Where anything goes}}</ref><ref name="times-anything"/>  

The Orb began performing regularly at the [[Brixton Academy]] in the early 1990s, where they used the high ceilings and large space for their "well-suited amorphous sound", frequently performing their newest and more experimental pieces there.<ref name="guardian-performance97">{{cite news|last=Cartwright |first=Garth |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[1997-04-02]] |title=Pop the Orb: Brixton Academy Review}}</ref> Andy Hughes took Weston's place at live performances after the 1993 tour, though Weston did reappear for The Orb's concert at the rainy [[Woodstock '94]].<ref name="amg-bio"/>  The Orb played for late night raves on the first two nights of Woodstock '94 in addition to artists including [[Aphex Twin]], [[Orbital]], and [[Deee-Lite]].  The next year, The Orb's touring group consisted of Paterson, Hughes, Nick Burton on percussion, and Simon Phillips on bass.  This ensemble of live performers and electronic music created a "cacophony" of "gigantic, swarming sounds".<ref name="times-something">{{cite news|last=Gray |first=Louise |work=[[The Times]] |page=1 |date=[[1995-04-11]] |title=Something in the Air: The Orb}}</ref>  Though The Orb's performances use much onstage equipment and many props, Paterson prefers to present The Orb as "a non-centralised figure of amusement on stage".<ref name="independent-earth"/>  

The Orb used [[ADAT]] recorders for performances from 1993 to 2001 and utilised large 48-track decks, which Paterson described as basically being a "studio onstage".<ref name="remix">{{cite web|work=[[Remix Magazine]] |last=Micallef |first=Ken |date=[[2004-09-01]] |title=The Orb |url=http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_orb/ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050913095705/remixmag.com/mag/remix_orb/ |archivedate=2005-12-26 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  They hooked synthesisers, such as the [[ARP 2600]], to [[MIDI]] interfaces to recreate specific sounds that appeared on their albums.<ref name="keyboard"/>  The Orb's methods of studio music creation changed as well.  For more recent albums such as ''Cydonia'', The Orb used inexpensive equipment such as [[Korg]]'s [[Electribe]] products, which Paterson described as employing more of a "bedroom techno" approach.<ref name="remixmag-orblivion"/>  Despite their use of laptops during performances and in-studio computers, Paterson says that he still cherishes vinyl and does not find purchasing CDs or downloading music to be nearly as satisfying.<ref name="guardian-interview"/>

===Sampling and remixing===
One of The Orb's most notable contributions to electronic music is their idea of blurring the distinction between sampling and remixing.<ref name="tandt"/> Albums such as ''Pomme Fritz'', though released as a piece of original work, consist largely of manipulated samples.  Conversely, The Orb's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single "Toxygene".  "Toxygene" was originally commissioned as a remix of [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s "Oxygene 8" from ''[[Oxygene 7-13]]''.<ref name="spheres">{{cite news|work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |title=Music of the Spheres: Orb |last=Smith |first=Andrew |date=[[1997-02-16]] |page=13}}</ref>  However, The Orb "obliterated it" and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly refused to release it;<ref name="spheres"/>  The Orb released the track themselves under the name "Toxygene", which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted "The French are always five years behind us, anyway."<ref name="spheres"/>  In statements made after the release of "Toxygene", however, Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it.<ref name="dotmusic">{{cite web|year=[[1997-01-27]] |last=Aston |first=Martin |title=Dotmusic Talent: Jean Michel Jarre |url=http://web.archive.org/web/19980708105644/http://www.dotmusic.co.uk/MWtalentjjarre.html |work=Dotmusic (retrieved from the [[Internet Archive]]) |accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref>

Other artists have gotten agitated with The Orb sampling their work, though Paterson jokingly suggests that "[t]hey don't know the half of it."<ref name="citypaper"/>  Paterson says that he finds a "beauty" and a "cleverness" with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it.<ref name="keyboard"/>  Even though fans often try to guess the origins of many of The Orb's samples, Paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would "die" if they discovered, for example, where the drums on "Little Fluffy Clouds" originated from.<ref name="remixmag-orblivion"/>  He has said that record labels have cautioned him, "Don't tell anyone where you got your samples until we get them cleared!".<ref name="remixmag-orblivion"/>

The Orb has used a wide variety of audio clips from sources ranging from [[McCarthy era]] speeches to prank phone calls by [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] to [[David Thewlis]]' apocalypse-driven rant from the film ''[[Naked (film)|Naked]]''.<ref name="rollingstone-live97"/>  Paterson obtains many samples from recording TV and radio for hours at a time and picking out his favorite clips.<ref name="keyboard"/>  He and other members of The Orb record nature sounds for use on albums, most notably on ''FFWD'' and ''Orbus Terrarum''.  The Orb's combination of ambient music and sampling from lower fidelity audio sources often creates a "fuzzy texture" in the sound quality, depersonalising The Orb's music.<ref name="tandt"/>  The Orb is lauded for their "Monty Python-esque levity" in their use of audio samples,<ref name="rs-orblivion"/> though ''NME'' asserts that Paterson "sabotage[s] his majestic soundscapes" with "irritatingly zany" sounds.<ref name="nme-aubrey">{{cite web|year=2002 |last=Thomas |first=Olly |title=Orb : Auntie Aubrey's Excursions Beyond The Call Of Duty Part 2 |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/orb/6159 |work=[[New Musical Express]] |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>  

The Orb has been a prolific remixing team, having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989.<ref name="backside"/>  Even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo, The Orb found steady work remixing for artists including [[Depeche Mode]], [[Lisa Stansfield]], and [[Front 242]].  Though The Orb's remixes from the early and mid-1990s feature a large number of comical samples, ''[[Progressive-Sounds]]'' describe them as "ahead of their time" and ''NME'' notes them as "not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling."<ref name="ps-aubrey"/><ref name="nme-aubrey"/>  However, some pieces, such as their [[Bee Gees]] cover collaboration with [[Robbie Williams]], received criticism for being "beyond a joke" for their use of strange noises.<ref name="nme-aubrey"/>  The Orb's remix of [[Nine Inch Nails]]' "[[The Perfect Drug]]", too, was described as "silly", as they made it sound like [[Trent Reznor]] was "drowning in his bathtub".<ref name="amazon-nin">{{cite web|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2006-10-23 |last=Bateman |first=Jeff |title=The Perfect Drug Editorial Review |url=http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Drug-Nine-Inch-Nails/dp/B000001Y7W}}</ref>  Though Paterson maintains that much of The Orb's remix work is done to support other artists, he admits some of their remixes for major artists were performed so that The Orb could "pay the bills".<ref name="birmingham-guru"/>
