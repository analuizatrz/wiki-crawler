The '''USS ''Whippoorwill'' (AM-207)''' was a ''Redwing''-class motor [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]: laid down [[7 January]] [[1954]] as AMS-207 by the [[Bellingham Shipyards]] Co., [[Bellingham, Washington]]; launched, [[13 August]] [[1954]]; redesignated a Coastal Minesweeper MSC-207, [[7 February]] [[1955]]; commissioned USS ''Whippoorwill'' (MSC-207), [[20 October]] [[1955]] at [[Tacoma, Washington]].

== Pacific Ocean Operations ==
 
On [[7 November]], the mine countermeasures ship reported for duty with the Commander, Mine Force, [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]. Over the next 10 months, she first conducted [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] training along the [[U.S. West Coast|west coast]] and then began normal duty with the Mine Force out of [[Long Beach, California]]. That duty lasted until [[1 August]] [[1956]], when she departed Long Beach for her new home port, [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], [[Japan]]. After stops at [[Oahu]] and [[Midway Island]], the coastal minesweeper arrived at Sasebo on [[21 August]] and reported for duty to the Commander, Mine Flotilla 1.
 
USS ''Whippoorwill'' was based in [[Japan]] for the next 14 years; and, during the first eight of those years, her duties centered upon training. She participated in numerous [[U.S. 7th Fleet]] mine exercises as well as many multinational mine exercises with units of the [[South Korea]]n, Royal [[Thailand|Thai]], [[Japan]]ese, [[Philippine Islands|Philippine]], and [[Nationalist Chinese]] Navies. She also participated in several large [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] training exercises conducted in [[Korea]], the [[Philippines]], and at [[Okinawa]] in the [[Ryukyus]].

== Quemoy and Matsu Crisis ==
 
Her one brush with less than peaceful duty came in the fall of 1958 when the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[communists]] began and continued their [[bombardment]] of Nationalist-held islands—[[Quemoy]], [[Little Quemoy]], and [[Matsu]]—located just off the mainland. USS ''Whippoorwill'' earned the [[Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal]] for her service in the [[Taiwan Strait]] during the crisis there that fall. Her service in the [[Taiwan Strait]] lasted from [[10 September]] until [[4 November]] when tension in the area finally began to cool. Upon concluding her service in the [[Taiwan Strait]], she resumed her more peaceful employment in training missions with the [[U.S. 7th Fleet]] and units of Allied navies.

== Vietnam War Support and Operations ==
 
The year [[1964]] brought the ship still closer to actual "hot war" operations. From [[16 July]] to [[2 August]] [[1964]], USS ''Whippoorwill'' joined a barrier patrol established in the [[South China Sea]] off the coast of [[South Vietnam]] to assist the South [[South Vietnam|Vietnamese]] Navy in preventing water-borne infiltrators and logistics from [[North Vietnam]] from reaching the [[Viet Cong]] rebels in the south. During that phase of American involvement, the [[U.S. Navy]]'s role remained essentially passive in nature. While American ships such as USS ''Whippoorwill'' stopped no craft themselves, they vectored [[South Vietnam]]ese ships in on suspicious contacts.
 
Though the barrier patrols were dissolved on [[2 August]], and USS ''Whippoorwill'' resumed her familiar training schedule, events occurred in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] that same day which increased American involvement in the [[Vietnam War|Vietnamese civil war]] and eventually brought USS ''Whippoorwill'' into intimate association with that conflict over the next six years. After nine months of normal [[U.S. 7th Fleet]] operations, the minesweeper returned to [[Vietnam]]ese waters on [[18 April]] [[1965]] as one of the American ships assigned to [[Operation Market Time]]. That operation consisted of continuous patrols along [[South Vietnam]]ese coasts in an effort to interdict the increasing volume of arms and supplies being smuggled from the north into [[South Vietnam]] in support of [[Viet Cong]] [[guerrillas]].

== Market Time Patrols ==
 
In many respects, USS ''Whippoorwill's'' "[[Operation Market Time]]" duties resembled the barrier patrols she had conducted the previous summer. However, they differed from those patrols in two major respects. First, as a result of the increasingly direct involvement of American forces in the [[Vietnam conflict]], ships on "Operation Market Time" station actively participated in stop-and-seizure operations rather than limiting themselves to [[surveillance]] and passive assistance to the [[South Vietnam]]ese Navy. Secondly, as a result of the increased communist logistic effort from north to south, "Market Time" operations became a continuous and intensive assignment. 

Until she returned to the [[United States]] in the fall of [[1970]], '''USS Whippoorwill's''' sole mission in the [[Vietnam conflict]] consisted of "Market Time" patrols. She alternated month-long tours on station in [[Vietnam]]ese waters with assignments of variable duration at other points in the Orient. Most often these missions away from [[Vietnam]] consisted of mine warfare exercises, upkeep and liberty calls in [[Japan]]ese ports, and periodic overhauls. Less frequently, they consisted of port calls at other places in the Far East.

== Return to Stateside ==
 
On [[1 September]] [[1970]], USS ''Whippoorwill'' concluded her final [[tour of duty]] along the coast of [[Vietnam]]. She steamed home — via [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], [[Subic Bay]], and [[Pearl Harbor]] — and arrived in [[Long Beach, California]], on [[12 November]]. 

== Decommissioning ==

After voyage repairs, she moved to [[San Francisco, California]], where she was decommissioned on [[15 December]] [[1970]]. Decommissioning, however, did not end her active naval service, for she joined [[USS Thrasher (MSC-203)|USS ''Thrasher'' (MSC-203)]] and [[USS Reaper (MSO-467)|USS ''Reaper'' (MSO-467)]] as a reserve [[training ship]] in Reserve Mine Division 52. For almost five years, she operated out of [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]] Naval Station training [[United States Navy Reserve|naval reservists]] during their annual active duty periods. 

On [[2 May]] [[1975]], USS ''Whippoorwill'' moved from [[San Francisco, California]], to the [[Inactive Ship Facility]] at [[Vallejo, California]]. She was decommissioned, [[15 December]] [[1970]] at [[San Francisco, California]], and placed "in service" as a [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] [[School ship|Training Ship]]; placed "out of service," [[30 June]] [[1975]]; struck from the [[Naval Register]], [[1 July]] [[1975]] and sold to the [[Republic of Singapore]] where she served as [[RSS Jupiter (M 101)|RSS ''Jupiter'' (M 101)]]; discarded, [[1990]]. Fate unknown.

== Awards == 
 
USS ''Whippoorwill'' received six [[battle stars]] and the [[Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal]], and the [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for [[Vietnam War|Vietnam service]].
