{{History of Peru}}
The '''Norte Chico civilization''' was a complex [[Pre-Columbian]] society that included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the [[Norte Chico]] region of north-central coastal [[Peru]]. It is the oldest known [[civilization]] in the Americas, having flourished between 3000 and 1800 B.C.

The ancient culture is sometimes referred to as the Caral-Supe, after [[Caral]] in the Supe Valley, a large and well studied Norte Chico site. In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a Preceramic culture of the pre-Columbian [[Cultural periods of Peru|Late Archaic]]; it lacked ceramics and known art. The most dynamic achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large [[platform mound]]s and sunken circular [[plaza]]s. Archeological evidence suggests use of [[textile]] technology and possible worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian [[Andean]] cultures. Sophisticated [[government]] is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico, and questions remain over its organization, particularly the impact that food resources had on politics.

Archealogists have been aware of ancient sites in the area since at least the 1940s; early work occurred at [[Aspero]] on the coast, and later at Caral further inland.<ref name=Polities>{{cite journal | last = Haas | first = Jonathon | coauthors = Winifred Creamer, Alvaro Ruiz | date = 2005 | title = Power and the Emergence of Complex Polities in the Peruvian Preceramic | journal = Archaeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 37-52 | accessdate = 2007-01-31}}</ref> A 2001 paper in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' magazine, extensively documenting Caral,<ref name=Caral>{{cite journal | last = Shady Solis | first = Ruth | coauthors = Jonathon Haas, Winifred Creamer | date = 27 April 2001 | title = Dating Caral, a Preceramic Site in the Supe Valley on the Central Coast of Peru  | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5517 | pages = 723-726  | doi = 10.1126/science.1059519 | accessdate = 2007-01-31}}</ref> and a 2004 ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' magazine piece, describing fieldwork and [[radiocarbon dating]] across a wider area,<ref name=Dating>{{cite journal | last = Haas | first = Jonathon | coauthors = Winifred Creamer, Alvaro Ruiz | date = 23 December 2004 | title = Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru | journal = Nature | volume = 432 | issue = | pages = 1020-1023  | doi = 10.1038/nature03146 | accessdate = 2007-01-31}}</ref> revealed Norte Chico's full significance and led to widespread attention.<ref>See [http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/01/04/norte.chico/ CNN] and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4115421.stm BBC], for instance.

==History and geography==

Andean Peru has been recognized as one of six global areas that saw the indigenous development of [[civilization]], and one of two, along with Mesoamerica, in the Western Hemisphere.<ref name=Dating/> Norte Chico has pushed back the horizon for complex societies in the Peruvian region by centuries. The [[Chavín culture]], circa 900 BC, had long been considered the first civilization of the area and is still regularly cited as such in general works.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa91 |title=History of Peru |accessdate=2007-01-31 |work=HISTORYWORLD }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=J.M. |title=The New Penguin History of the World |edition=Fourth | year=2004 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn= |pages=153 |quote= [The Americas] are millennia behind the development of civilization elsewhere, whatever the cause of that may be.}} ''The implied laggardness appears disproven by Norte Chico; in his work, Mann is sharply critical of the inattention provided the Pre-Columbian Americas.''</ref>

The discovery of Norte Chico has also shifted the focus of research away from the highland areas of the Andes (where the Chavín, and later [[Inca]], had their major centers) to the Peruvian [[littoral]], or coastal regions. Norte Chico is located in a central area of the coast, roughly bounded by the [[Lurin Valley]] on the south and the [[Casma Valley]] on the north. It comprises four coastal valleys, the Huaura, Supe, Pativilca, and Fortaleza;  known sites are concentrated in the latter three, which share a common coastal plain. The three principal valleys cover only 1,800 km², and research has emphasized the density of the population centers.<ref name=Polities/> The Peruvian littoral appears an "improbable, even aberrant" candidate for the "pristine" development of civilization, compared to other world centers.<ref name=1491Book>{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles C.

The region, however, is punctuated by more than fifty rivers that carry Andean snowmelt, and the development of widespread [[irrigation]] from these water sources is seen as decisive in the emergence of Norte Chico;<ref name=Urban>{{cite journal | last = Pringle | first = Heather | date = 27 April 2001 | title = The First Urban Center in the Americas | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5517 | pages = 621 | doi = 10.1126/science.292.5517.621 | accessdate = 2007-02-01}}''The claim in this ''Science'' 'News of the Week' column that Caral is the oldest urban center in the Americas is highly uncertain.''</ref><ref name=NewLight>{{cite press release |title=Archaeologists shed new light on Americas’ earliest known civilization |publisher=Northern Illinios University |date= 22 December 2004 |url=http://www.niu.edu/PubAffairs/RELEASES/2004/dec/peru.shtml |accessdate= 2007-02-01 |quote= }}</ref> all of the monumental architecture at various sites has been found close to irrigation channels.

[[Image:PeruCaral01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Remains of the Caral pyramids in the arid Supe Valley.]]
The radiocarbon work of Haas et al., found that 10 of 95 samples taken in the Pativilca and Fortaleza areas dated prior to 3500 BC; the oldest, dated to 9210 BC, provides "limited indication" of human settlement during the Pre-Columbian Early Archaic era. Two dates of 3700 BC are associated with communal architecture, but are likely anamolous. It is from 3200 BC onward that large scale human settlement and communal construction are clearly apparent.<ref name=Dating/> Mann, in his survey of the literature, suggests "sometime before 3200 B.C., and possibly before 3500 B.C." as the beginning date of the Norte Chico flourishing. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at Huaricanga, in the Fortaleza area of the north.<ref name=1491Book/> 

Haas' early third millennium dates suggest that the development of coastal and inland sites occurred in parallel. However, from 2500 to 2000 BC, the period of greatest expansion, a decisive shift toward the inland sites occurs. All apparent development occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, though they remained dependent on fish and shellfish from the coast.<ref name=Dating/> The peak in dates is in keeping with Shady's dates at Caral, which show habitation from 2627 BC to 2020 BC.<ref name=Caral/> That coastal and inland sites developed in tandem remains disputed, however (see next section). 

Circa 1800 BC the Norte Chico civilization began to decline, with more powerful centers appearing to the south and north along the coast, and to the east inside the belt of the Andes. Norte Chico's success at irrigation-based agriculture may have contributed to its being eclipsed. One researcher notes that "when this civilization is in decline, we begin to find extensive canals farther north. People were moving to more fertile ground and taking their knowledge of irrigation with them."<ref name=NewLight/> It would be another thousand years before the appearance of the next great Peruvian culture, the Chavín.

==Maritime coast and agricultural interior==
[[Image:Anchovy closeup.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Anchovies were a crucial food resource at ancient Norte Chico.]]
Research into Norte Chico remains partial and debate is on-going over two related questions: the degree to which the Norte Chico flourishing was based on maritime food resources, and the exact relationship this implies between the coastal and inland sites.<ref>"Interior" and "inland" do not refer here to the mountainous interior of Peru proper. All of the Norte Chico sites are broadly coastal, within 100km of the coast and within the Peruvian littoral (Caral is at 23km). "Interior" and "inland" are used here to contrast with sites that are literally adjacent to the ocean.</ref>

===Confirmed diet===
 
A broad outline of the Norte Chico diet has been suggested. At Caral, the [[edible]] [[domesticated]] [[plant]]s noted by Shady are [[squash]], [[beans]], [[lucuma]], [[guava]], [[pacay]], and [[camote]].<ref name=Caral/> Haas et al. derived an identical list in their survey further north, while adding [[avocado]] and [[achira]]. A significant [[seafood]] component, at both coastal and inland sites, is also apparent. Shady notes that "animal remains are almost exclusively marine" at Caral, including [[clams]] and [[mussels]], and a large amount of [[anchovies]] and [[sardines]].<ref name=Caral/> That the anchovy fish reached inland is apparent,<ref name=1491Book/> though Haas suggests that "[[shellfish]] [which would include clams and mussels], [[sea mammal]]s, and [[seaweed]] do not appear to have been significant portions of the diet in the inland, nonmaritime sites".<ref name=Polities/>

==="Maritime foundation of Andean civilization"===

It is the role of the maritime dietary component that has aroused debate. Much early fieldwork (prior to the realization of the full scope and inter-connectedness of the civilization) was done in the region of Aspero on the coast. In a 1973 paper, Moseley confirmed a previously observed lack of ceramics at Aspero, and deduced that "[[hummock]]s" on the site actually constituted the remains of artificial platform mounds. Most provocatively, he contended that a maritime subsistence ([[seafood]]) economy had been the basis of the society and its remarkably early flourishing,<ref name=Moseley73>{{cite journal | last = Moseley | first = Edward | coauthors = Gordon R. Willey | date = 1973 | title = Aspero, Peru: A Reexamination of the Site and Its Implications | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 452-468 | accessdate = 2007-02-01}} "We see the site as a 'peaking' of an essentially non-agricultural economy. Subsistence was still, basically, from the sea. But such subsistence supported a sedantry style of life, with communities of appreciable size."</ref> a theory later eloborated as a "maritime foundation of Andean civilization" (MFAC). MFAC was out-of-keeping with general consensus on the rise of civilization: intensive agriculture, particularly of at least one [[cereal]], has long been seen as essential in the emergence of complex society. Moseley's ideas would be debated and challenged (that maritime remains and their caloric contribution were over-estimated, for example<ref name=Raymond>{{cite journal | last = Raymond | first = J. Scott | date = 1981 | title = The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization: A Reconsideration of the Evidence | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 806-821 | doi = 10.2307/280107 | accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref>) but have been treated as plausible as late as Mann's summary. 

Concomitant to the maritime subsistence hypothesis, was an implied dominance of sites immediately adjacent to the coast over other centers. This idea was shaken by the realization of the magnitude of Caral, an inland site. Supplemental to Shady's article dating Caral, a ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' news article emphasized the dominance of agriculture and also suggested that Caral was the oldest [[urban center]] in Peru (and the entire Americas), deprecating the idea that civilization might have begun adjacent to the coast and then moved inland. One archeologist was quoted as suggesting "Rather than coastal antecedents to monumental inland sites, what we have now are coastal satellite villages to monumental inland sites." <ref name=Urban/> 

These assertions were quickly challenged by Sandweiss and Moseley, who observed that Caral, though the largest and most complex Preceramic site, is not the oldest; the importance of agriculture to industry and to augment [[diet]] was admitted, while "the formative role of marine resources in early Andean civilization" was still broadly affirmed.<ref name=CaralResponse>{{cite journal | last = Sandweiss | first = Daniel H. | coauthors = Michael E. Moseley | date = 2001 | title = Amplifying Importance of New Research in Peru | journal = Science | volume = 294 | issue = 5547 | pages = 1651-1653 | accessdate = 2007-02-02}}</ref> That the inland sites did have significantly greater populations is not now disputed and there were "so many more people along the four rivers than on the shore that they had to have been dominant."<ref name=1491Book/> The question is which of the areas developed first and created a template for subsequent development.<ref name=Oldest>{{cite journal | last = Mann | first = Charles C. | date = 7 January 2005| title = Oldest Civilization in the Americas Revealed | journal = Science | volume = 307 | pages = 34-35 | accessdate = 2007-02-04}}</ref> Haas rejects suggestions that maritime development at sites immediately adjacent to the coast was initial, pointing to contemporaneous development based on his dating;<ref name=Dating/> Moseley remains convinced that coastal Aspero is the oldest site, and that its maritime subsistence served as a basis for the civilization.<ref name=1491Book/><ref name=CaralResponse/>

===Cotton and politics===

The basis of the supposed dominance that the inland had over coast (whether development was earlier, later, or contemporaneous) appears to have been derived from [[cotton]].<ref name=1491Book/><ref name=Polities/> Though not edible, it was the most important product of irrigation in the Norte Chico, vital to the production of [[fishing net]]s (that in turn provided maritime resources) as well as to [[textile]]s and textile technology. Haas notes that "control over cotton allows a ruling elite to provide the benefit of cloth for [[clothing]], [[bag]]s, wraps, and adornment."<ref name=Polities/> The need for cotton for fishing nets was most vital, but Haas is a willing to admit that a [[chicken and egg|mutual dependency dilemma]] exists: "The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the [[fishermen]] needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish."<ref name=Polities/> Thus, identifying cotton as a vital resource produced in the inland, does not by itself resolve the issue of whether the inland centers were a progenitor for the coast or vice versa (Moseley argues, for instance, that successful maritime centers would have moved inland to find cotton<ref name=1491Book/>); the exact relationship between food resources and political organization remains unresolved.

Regardless of the status of maritime food resources, Norte Chico's development is still remarkable for the apparent absence of a cereal. [[Maize]] formed the dietary backbone of later pre-Columbian American civilizations, and is a now a globally vital crop. There is no evidence of its widespread cultivation in Norte Chico. Moseley found a small number of maize cobs in 1973 at Aspero (also seen in site work in the 1940s and 50s)<ref name=Moseley73/> but has since called the find "problematic"<ref name=CaralResponse/>; other researchers have suggested no evidence of the crop.

==Social organization==

===Labour and economy===

The Norte Chico chiefdoms were "almost certainly [[theocracy|theocratic]], though not brutally so." Construction areas show possible evidence of [[Festival|feasting]], which would have included [[music]] and likely [[alcohol]], suggesting an elite able to both mobilize and reward the population.<ref name=1491Book/> The degree of centralized authority is difficult to ascertain with such an ancient civilization, but architectural construction patterns are suggestive of significant capacity. While some of the monumental architecture was constructed incrementally, other buildings, such as the two main platform mounds at Caral,<ref name=Caral/> appear to have been constructed in one or two intense construction phases. This is indicative of an elite that, at least in certain places at certain times, wielded considerable power.<ref name=Polities/>

Haas suggests three broad bases of power for early complex societies—economic, physical, and ideological—and finds two of three present in ancient Norte Chico. Economic power would have rested on the control of cotton and edible plants, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that the scope of this power base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and [[Bandurria]]) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is at least possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were at the center of a broad regional trade network centered on these resources. <ref name=Polities/> 

''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine, citing Shady, suggests a rich and varied trade life: "[Caral] exported its own products and those of Aspero to distant communities in exchange for exotic imports: [[spondylus]] shells from the coast of Ecuador, rich [[dyes]] from the Andean highlands, hallucinogenic [[snuff]] from the Amazon."<ref name=Discover>{{cite journal | last = Miller| first = Kenneth | url = http://www.discover.com/issues/sep-05/features/showdown-at-caral/?page=1 | date = September 2005 | title = Showdown at the O.K. Caral | journal = Discover | volume = 26 | issue = 9 | accessdate = 2007-02-27}}</ref> (Given the still limited extent of Norte Chico research, such claims should be treated circumspectly.)

===Ideology, religion, and warfare===

Ideological power would have rested on access to [[deities]] and the [[supernatural]].<ref name=Polities/> Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited, but fascinating: the image of the [[Staff God]], a major deity of later Andean cultures, has been found on a [[gourd]] dated to 2250 BC, suggesting worship of common symbols of gods.<ref name=Religion>{{cite journal | last = Hoag | first = Hanna | date = 15 April 2003 | title = Oldest evidence of Andean religion found | journal = Nature | issue = online | doi = 10.1038/news030414-4 | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref><ref name=icon>{{cite journal | last = Hecht | first = Jeff | date = 14 April 2003 | title = America's oldest religious icon revealed | journal = New Scientist | issue = online | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn362510.1038/news030414-4 | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref> The act of architectural construction and maintenance may also have been a spirtual experience: a process of communal exaltation and [[ceremony|ceremonialism]].<ref name=Oldest/> 

What is absent is any suggestion of physical bases of power. There is no evidence of [[warfare]] of "of any kind or at any level during the Preceramic Period."<ref name=Polities/> Mutilated bodies, burned buildings, and other tell-tale signs of violence are absent, and settlement patterns are completely nondefensive.<ref name=Oldest/> This is out of keeping archeological theory, which suggests that human beings move away from kin-based groups to larger units resembling "[[state]]s" for mutual defence of often scarce resources. A vital resource was present ([[arable land]] generally, and the cotton crop specifically) but the move to greater complexity was not driven by the need for defence or warfare.<ref name=Oldest/>

==Sites and architecture==

Norte Chico sites are notable for exceptional collective density, as well as individual size. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization, and that during the [[third millenium BC]] Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, northern [[Ancient China|China]]).<ref name=Polities/>

The Supe, Pativilca, and Fortaleza each have large clusters of sites, with a single site found on the Huaura. The groundbreaking work of 1973 at Aspero at the mouth of Supe suggested a site of approximately 13 [[hectare]]s. The [[midden]] was surveyed and extensive prehistoric construction activity suggested. Small scale [[terracing]] is noted along with more sophisticated platform mound [[masonry]]. As many as eleven artificial mounds "could be" present—what Moseley calls "Corporate Labor Platforms", given that their size, layout, and construction materials and techniques would have required an organized [[workforce]].<ref name=Moseley73/>

The survey of the northern rivers found sites between 10 and 100 [[hectare]]s; between one and seven large [[platform mound]]s—rectangular, [[terrace]]d [[pyramid]]s—were discovered, ranging in size from 3,000 to over 100,000m<sup>3</sup>.<ref name=Dating/> Shady notes that the central zone of Caral, with monumental architecture, covers an area of just over 65 ha. Six platform mounds, numerous smaller mounds, two sunken circular plazas, and a variety of residential architecture were also discovered at this site.<ref name=Caral/>

==Development and its absence==

[[Image:Quipu.png|thumb|right|200px|The presence of [[Quipu]] tentatively suggests a "proto-writing" system in ancient Norte Chico]].
When compared to the common [[Eurasian]] models of the development of civilization, Norte Chico's differences are striking. A total lack of [[ceramic]]s persists across the period. The BBC observes that Norte Chico's people would have roasted their various crops, with no pots to boil them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1298460.stm |title= Oldest city in the Americas | date = 26 April 2001 | accessdate=2007-02-16 |work=BBC News}}</ref> The lack of pottery was accompanied by a lack of (archeologically apparent) art. In conversation with Mann, Ruiz observes: {{cquote|In the Norte Chico we see almost no [[visual art]]s. No [[sculpture]], no carving or [[bas-relief]], almost no [[painting]] or [[drawing]]—the interiors are completely bare. What we do see are these huge mounds—and [[textile]]s.}}
While the absence of ceramics appears anomalous, the presence of textiles is intriguing. [[Quipu]] (or Khipu), string-based recording devices, have been found at Caral, tentatively suggesting a writing, or "proto-writing", system at Norte Chico.<ref name=Quipu>{{cite journal | last = Mann | first = Charles C. | date = 12 August 2005 | title = Unraveling Khipu’s Secrets | journal = Science | volume = 309 | issue = 5737 | pages = 1008-1009 | doi = 10.1126/science.309.5737.1008 | accessdate = 2007-02-01}}</ref> (The discovery was reported by Mann in ''Science'' but has not been formally published or described by Shady.) The exact use of Quipu in this and later Andean cultures has been widly debated. It was originally believed to be simply a [[mnemonic]] used to record numeric information, such as a count of items bought and sold. Evidence has emerged that the Quipu may also have recorded [[logographic]] information in the same way writing does. Research has focused on the much larger sample of a few hundred Quipu dating to Inca times; the Norte Chico discovery remains singular and indeciphered.<ref>See ''1491'', appendix B.</ref>

==Research controversies==

The enormity of the Norte Chico finding has brought academic argument and accusation in its wake. The "monumental feud", as described by ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'', has included "public insults, a charge of plagiarism, ethics inquiries in both [Peru and the United States], and complaints by Peruvian officials to the U.S. government."<ref name=Archaeology>{{cite journal | last = Atwood | first = Roger | url = http://www.archaeology.org/0507/abstracts/caral.html | date = July/August 2005 | title = A Monumental Feud | journal = Archeology | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | accessdate = 2007-02-27}}</ref> The lead author of the seminal paper of April 2001<ref name=Caral/> was Peruvian [[Ruth Shady]], who worked with Jonathon Haas and Winifred Creamer, a married American team; the coauthoring was reportedly suggested by Haas, in the hopes that the involvement of American researchers would help secure future research funding. Later, Shady would level charges of [[plagiarism]] and insufficient attribution at Haas and Creamer, suggesting the pair had received credit for her own research, which had been on-going since 1994.<ref name=Discover/> Haas and Creamer were cleared of the plagiarism charge by their institutions, but the [[Field Museum]]’s science advisory council rebuked Haas for press releases and Web pages that gave too little credit to Shady "and inflated the couple’s role as discoverers."<ref name=Discover/> The dispute remains heated, and there are concerns that it could make it more difficult for American archeologists to receive permission to work in Peru.<ref name=Archaeology/>
