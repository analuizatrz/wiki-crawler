'''''The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest''''' (also known as '''''Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures''''') is an [[animated]] [[television series]] produced by [[Cartoon Network Studios|Hanna-Barbera Cartoons]] from [[1996]] to [[1997]], and aired on all three major [[Turner Broadcasting]] entertainment networks ([[Cartoon Network]], [[TBS Superstation]], and [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]). The program is a spin-off of Hanna-Barbera's classic series ''[[Jonny Quest]]'', and features slightly older versions of the same characters and a similar format.

Eleven-year old boy hero Jonny Quest is now an adventurous fourteen year old, and more determined to be more active in the adventures his father, noted [[phenomenologist]] Dr. Benton Quest, and  the family bodyguard, Roger "Race" Bannon, often find themselves involved in. Joining them are Jonny's adopted brother [[Hadji (character)|Hadji]]  and Race’s daughter Jessie. As in the original series, the Quest team travels across the globe, encountering strange and unusual adventures, villains, and creatures. The series had a much darker tone then the original series, with some non-recurring characters suffering gruesome off-camera deaths (with the deaths acknowledged by reaction shots of the leads). For example, in the climax of one episode, one villain is killed by being impaled on the rib cage of an elephant's skeletal remains, and another has his head crushed under an elephant's foot.

==About the show==
''The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest'' had a notably troubled development process. The program began production in [[1992]], but faced many setbacks and spent three years in “[[development hell]]”. The original production team was therefore fired, and two new teams of producers were brought in. John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti worked with the leftover models from the previous team, which featured an edgier, [[anime]] inspiration, so as to get the show on the air by 1996. Meanwhile, Davis Doi and Larry Houston decided to redesign the characters closer to the 1964 ''Jonny Quest'' originals. The two versions of the series were originally meant to have been launched separately, but, after the [[Time Warner]]-Turner merger, the Doi/Houston episodes were broadcast as the second season of ''The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest'' instead of on their own.

The Eng/Anzilotti version of the show (the one present in all merchandising related to the show) is referred to as the “Season One” version, while the Doi/Houston episodes are referred to as the “Season Two” version. However, all fifty-two episodes (twenty-six of each version) were all aired during the 1996-1997 television season, and, while most of the Season One episodes aired first, episodes from the two versions were intermixed as the show went on.

The two "seasons" also featured different voice casts.  "Season One" featured [[J. D. Roth]] as Jonny, [[George Segal]] as Dr. Quest, [[Robert Patrick]] as Race, [[Jesse Douglas (actress)|Jesse Douglas]] as Jessie, and [[Michael Benyaer]] as Hadji. "Season Two" featured [[Quinton Flynn]] as Jonny, [[John de Lancie]] as Dr. Quest, [[Robert Foxworth]] as Race, [[Jennifer Hale]] as Jessie, and [[Rob Paulsen]] as Hadji.

An added element in the “Season One” episodes was the concept of [[cyberspace]]. Dr. Quest developed a virtual reality system called “Questworld”, which was depicted using three-dimensional [[computer animation]]. The rest of the program was created using [[traditional animation]].

Recurring villains in the “Season One” episodes include [[hacker]] [[Jeremiah Surd]] and prophetic madman [[Ezekiel Rage]]. In keeping with the original 1964 feel, the main recurring villains in the “Season Two” episodes are Dr. Zin, the Quest team’s traditional archenemy, and his two daughters. The "Season Two" team made a point of killing off the recurring villains from "Season One".

Fifty-two episodes of ''The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest'' were eventually produced, and the show is currently in [[Television syndication|syndication]].
