'''Yoga''' ([[Devanagari]]: योग) is one of the six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], focusing on [[meditation]].  In India, Yoga is seen as a means to both physiological and spiritual mastery. Outside [[India]], Yoga has become primarily associated with the practice of [[asanas]] (postures) of [[Hatha Yoga]] (see [[Yoga as exercise]]). 

Yoga as a means of spiritual attainment is central to [[Hinduism]] (including [[Vedanta]]), [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] and has influenced other religious and spiritual practices throughout the world. [[Hindu]] texts establishing the basis for yoga include the [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] and many others.  

The four main paths of Yoga are [[Karma Yoga]], [[Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti Yoga]] and [[Raja Yoga]].  A committed practitioner of yoga is referred to as a [[yogi]], [[yogin]] (masculine), or [[yogini]] (feminine).

==Etymology==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
{{See also|History of Yoga}}
[[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|[[:wikt:yoga|yoga]]}}'' is a derivation of ''yugam'' "yoke", cognate to modern [[English Language|English]] ''yoke'', and [[Latin]] ''iugum'' in [[Latin]], all from  [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*yugom'', from a root ''*yeug''- (Sanskrit ''yuj-'') meaning "to join" or "unite".

The term is attested since the [[Rigveda]] in the sense of "act of yoking, joining, attaching, harnessing" but also "undertaking, business, performance". A mental sense of "exertion, zeal, diligence" is attested since the [[Mahabharata]], and the spiritual or mystical sense of
"abstract contemplation, meditation" likewise appears in the Mahabharata as well as in the [[Upanishad]]s.

==Texts on Yoga==
===Bhagavad Gita===
{{Main|Bhagavad Gita}}
The Bhagavad Gita ('Song of the Lord'), thought to have been written some time between 400 and 100 BCE, talks of four branches of yoga:

*[[Karma yoga]]:  The yoga of action in the world
*[[Jnana yoga]]:  The yoga of Wisdom and intellectual endeavor
*[[Bhakti yoga]]: The yoga of devotion to a deity
*[[Raja yoga]]:   The yoga of meditation

===Yoga Sutras of Patanjali===
{{main|Patanjali|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
The [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] are a book of 196 aphorisms compiled by the sage Patanjali sometime between 100 BCE and 200 CE. It is understood{{who}} that Patanjali, as a theoretical and practical base, drew and developed his system from the [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Samkhya]] philosophy. [[Patanjali]] in the Yoga Sutras presents the goal of yoga as 'the cessation of mental fluctuations' (cittavrtti nirodha).

In reference to the Bhagavad Gita classifications, Patanjali's yoga is a form of [[Raja yoga]], as it seeks meditation as the path towards the ultimate goal. Patanjali himself referred to it as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"), from the eight steps he set out as the practical path towards attainment of enlightenment. This eight-limbed concept became an authoritative feature of Raja yoga from that point forward, and is a core characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today.

Patanjali's Eight Limbs of yoga practice are:
:(1) ''[[Yamas|Yama]]'' (The five "abstentions"): violence, lying, theft, (illicit) sex, and possessions
:(2) ''[[Niyama]]'' (The five "observances"): purity, contentment, austerities, study, and surrender to [[god]]
:(3) ''[[Asana]]'': Literally means "seat", and in Patanjali's Sutras refers to seated positions used for meditation. Later, with the rise of Hatha yoga, asana came to refer to all the "postures"
:(4) ''[[Pranayama]]'' ("Life Force Control"): Control of ''prāna'', life force, or vital energy
:(5) ''[[Pratyahara]]'' ("Abstraction"): Reversal of the sense organs
:(6) ''[[Dharana]]'' ("Concentration"): Fixing the attention on a single object
:(7) ''[[Dhyana]]'' ("Meditation"): Intense contemplation of the true nature of reality
:(8) ''[[Samadhi]]'' ("Liberation"): Super-conscious state of enlightenment

===Hatha Yoga Pradipika===
{{Main|Hatha yoga}}
Hatha Yoga is a particular system of Yoga introduced by [[Yogi Swatmarama]], a yogic sage of the 15th century in India, and compiler of the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]. Hatha Yoga is a development of — but also differs substantially from — the [[Raja Yoga]] of Patanjali, in that it focuses on ''[[shatkarma]]'', the purification of the physical as leading to the purification of the mind (''ha'') and ''[[prana]]'', or vital energy (''tha'').  In contrast, the Raja Yoga posited by Patanjali begins with a purification of the mind (''yamas'') and spirit (''niyamas''), then comes to the body via ''[[asana]]'' (body postures) and ''[[pranayama]]'' (breath). Hatha yoga contains substantial [[tantric]] influence, and marks the first point at which [[chakras]] and [[kundalini]] were introduced into the yogic canon. Compared to the seated asanas of Patanjali's Raja yoga which were seen largely as a means of preparing for meditation, it also marks the development of asanas as full body 'postures' in the modern sense.

Hatha Yoga in its many modern variations is the style that most people actually associate with the word "Yoga" today.<ref>Feuerstein, Georg. (1996). ''The Shambhala Guide to Yoga''. Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, Inc.</ref> Because its emphasis is on the body through ''asana'' and ''pranayama'' practice, many western students are satisfied with the physical health and vitality it develops and are not interested in the other six limbs of the complete Hatha yoga teaching, or with the even older Raja Yoga tradition it is based on.

===Other works===
The sage Sri Nathamuni supposedly composed the ''Yoga-Rahasya'' in the 9th or 10th century CE, although no copies of this work are known to exist. [[Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya]] claimed to have received knowledge of this text in a vision. Krishnamacharya is also responsible for the only known translation of the ''Yogayajnavalikya Samhita'', a dialogue between the great sage Yajnavalkya and his learned wife Maithreyi, to whom part of the Rig Veda is attributed. Like the ''Gheranda Samhita'' and the ''Hatha Yoga Pradipika'', the Yogayajnavalikya Samhita is generally considered a tantric yoga work.

==Yoga philosophy==
[[Image:Sivakempfort.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A large statue in [[Bangalore]] depicting [[Lord Shiva]] meditating.]]

In all branches of yoga, the ultimate goal is the attainment of liberation from worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death (''[[Samsara]]''). Yoga entails mastery over the body, mind, and emotional self, and transcendence of desire. According to the followers, the [[Yogi]] eventually reaches the enlightened state (''[[Moksha]]'') where there is a cessation of thought and an experience of blissful union. This union may be of the individual soul (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'') with the supreme Reality (''[[Brahman]]''), as in [[Advaita Vedanta]]; with a specific god or goddess, as in [[Dvaita]] or [[dualistic]] forms of [[Hinduism]] and some forms of [[Buddhism]].

Common to most forms of yoga is the practice of concentration (''[[Dharana|dharana]]'') and [[meditation]] (''[[Dhyana|dhyana]]''). ''Dharana'', according to [[Patanjali|Patanjali's]] definition, is the "binding of consciousness to a single point." The awareness is concentrated on a fine point of sensation (such as that of the breath entering and leaving the nostrils). Sustained single-pointed concentration gradually leads to meditation (''dhyana''), in which the inner faculties are able to expand and merge with something vast. Meditators sometimes report feelings of peace, joy, and oneness.

The focus of '''meditation''' may differ from school to school, e.g. meditation on one of the ''[[chakra]]s'', such as the heart center (''[[anahata]]'') or the 'third eye' (''[[ajna]]''); or meditation on a particular deity, such as [[Krishna]]; or on a quality like [[peace]]. Non-dualist schools such as ''[[Advaita Vedanta]]'' may stress meditation on the Supreme with no form or qualities (''[[Nirguna Brahman]]''). This is in many ways analogous to Buddhist meditation on [[Shunyata|Emptiness]].

==Yoga in other traditions==
The goals of yoga are expressed differently in different traditions. In [[Hinduism]], with its variegated viewpoints and sects, [[Self-Realization]] and [[God-Realization]] are used interchangeably, with the underlying belief that the true nature of self (truth, consciousness, and bliss), revealed through the practice of yoga, has the same nature as the universal self, which may or may not be identified with a 'creator God' depending on the philosophical standpoint of the practitioner. In [[Buddhism]], which does not postulate a creator-type god, yoga may help people deepen their [[wisdom]], [[compassion]], and [[insight]]. In Western nations, where there is a strong emphasis on [[individualism]], yoga practice may be an extension of the search for meaning in self, and integration of the different aspects of being. 

For the average person still far from enlightenment, yoga can be a way of increasing one's spiritual awareness, or cultivating [[compassion]] and [[insight]]. While the [[history of yoga]] strongly connects it with [[Hinduism]], proponents claim that yoga is not a religion itself, but contains practical steps which can be found in the esoteric spiritual practices of all religions, as well as those who do not consider themselves religious.

===Yoga and Buddhism===
It is quite likely that Buddha ([[Siddhartha Gautama]]), who is estimated to have lived 563 to 483 BC, actually studied what was known of yoga at that time as part of his extensive education in [[Hindu]] [[philosophy]]. It is also very likely, given the rapid growth of Buddhism after his death and before the Bhagavad Gita and Patanjali's Yoga Sutras were composed, that Buddhism had some influence on those works.

In either case, there is a considerable overlap between the Hindu yoga tradition and Buddhism. Of particular interest is a comparison of the Buddhist [[eight-fold path]] and the eight limbs of Patanjali's Yoga. Their moral precepts (the ''[[sila]]'' of Buddhism, the ''[[yama]]'' and ''[[niyama]]'' of yoga) share the Hindu principle of [[non-violence]] (''[[ahimsa]]''); their final steps point towards a common goal - 6. Buddhist ''[[Samma Vayama]]'' (Effort) vs Yogic ''[[Dharana]]'' ([[Concentration]]), 7. Buddhist ''[[Samma Sati]]'' ([[Mindfulness]]) vs Yogic ''[[Dhyana]]'' ([[Meditation]]) and
8. Buddhist ''Samma Samadhi'' vs Yogic ''Samadhi''. In relation to views of the Self, yoga's ''asmita-samapatti'' is designed to eradicate the wrong views on the Self much in the same way Buddha did it in ''Anatta-lakkhana-sutta''.

Yoga is central to [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In the [[Nyingma]] tradition, practitioners progress to increasingly profound levels of yoga, starting with [[Mahayoga|Mahā yoga]], continuing to [[Anuyoga|Anu yoga]] and ultimately undertaking the highest practice, [[Atiyoga|Ati yoga]]. In the [[Sarma]] traditions, the [[Annutarayoga|Annutara yoga]] class is equivalent. Other [[tantra]] yoga practices include a system of [[108 (number)|108]] bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm timing in movement exercises is known as [[Trul khor]] or union of moon and sun (channel) prajna energies, and the body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the [[Dalai Lama]]'s summer temple of [[Lukhang]].

=== Yoga and Tantra ===
{{Main|Tantra}}
Yoga is often mentioned in company with [[Tantra]], and it is true that these traditions have influenced one another over time. They are both families of spiritual texts, practices, and lineages with origins in the Indian subcontinent and both have been popularized in the West.

Tantra has roots in the first millennium, and incorporates [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]] worship. It focuses on the [[kundalini]], a three and a half-coiled 'snake' of spiritual energy at the base of the spine that rises through [[chakras]] until [[union]] ('[[samadhi]]') between Shiva and Shakti is ultimately achieved. These concepts were formally introduced into yoga with the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], and because of the subsequent popularity of Hatha Yoga, many Hindu and western yoga teachers now accept these essentially tantric concepts within the yogic philosophy, and this is the most obvious major intersection between tantra and yoga today. The acceptance of tantric kundalini teachings into modern yoga was reinforced by the [[New Age]] movement which accompanied (and simultaneously reinforced) the rise of popularity of yoga in the West.

However, Tantra and Yoga have notable points of difference. Where body consciousness is seen as the root cause of bondage in Yoga, Tantra views the body as a means to understanding, rather than as an obstruction, which bears certain similarities with the [[Natya Yoga]]. As a result, in India particularly, one of the two branches of Tantra often carries quite negative connotations involving sexual misbehavior and black magic, although it must be said most forms actually follow quite mainstream social mores and this is simply an expression of prejudice.

The actual method of Tantra is quite different to traditional Raja Yoga. It emphasises [[mantra]] (Sanskrit prayers, often to gods, that are repeated), [[yantra]] (complex symbols and archetypal geometric pattering or [[sacred geometry]] housing [[deity]], manifesting in a plethora of forms with a discernable syntactic pattern), and rituals that range from simple [[murti]] (a statue housing a deity) or image worship to meditation on a corpse or of [[coitus]] in a [[charnel]] ground - which is challenging for some, but simply an active meditation with the intention to resolve the perceived duality of the creative and destructive universal principle.
