His last named is '''Carradine''', frequently referred to as simply the '''burglar''', is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is best known as the first criminal faced by [[Spider-Man]], and as the killer of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]]. He first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962).

The burglar's first name was never revealed in the comics. He was completely unnamed in ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15. The last name of Carradine wasn't given to him until 1996 with the introduction of his estranged daughter Jessica, and even then it may be a name adopted independent of her father. <ref> ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #0 </ref> In the [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|''Spider-Man'' video game]] based on [[Spider-Man (film)|the 2002 film]], he is called "'''Spike'''", though this may be simply a nickname. In the film ''[[Spider Man 3]]'', [[Captain Stacy]] revealed that the burglar's full name was '''Dennis "Spike" Carradine''', though this does not necessarily make this name canon in the comic's continuity.

== Fictional character biography ==

Little of the Burglar's early history is known, but it is mentioned that even in his younger years he was a criminal. Caught at some point in his life, the Burglar became the cellmate of elderly gangster Dutch Mallone. The Burglar learned from Dutch, who talked in his sleep, about a large stash of money the aged gangster had hidden in a suburban home, which the Burglar planned and schemed to get. <ref> ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #200 </ref>

Wanting to find out the location of the home where Mallone's stash was, the Burglar robbed a television station for information, with a guard in hot pursuit of him. The Burglar's thievery was a success, as he outran the guard and Spider-Man, then a celebrity, despite having the chance to, didn't bother to stop him. Learning that the house where Mallone's money was was the Parker house, the Burglar broke into it searching for the money, killing Ben Parker when he tried to stop him. Fleeing the scene, the Burglar was chased by police to a warehouse, where Spider-Man, wanting to avenge the death of his Uncle Ben, attacked and knocked out the Burglar, who he realized was the thief he had encountered earlier at the television station. The Burglar was later left to be captured by the authorities by Spider-Man, who, realizing he could have prevented Ben's death, decided to use his powers more responsibly. <ref> ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 </ref>

Years later, the Burglar, having served his time in prison, was released, despite being deemed mentally unstable by psychiatrists. <ref> ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #170 </ref> Still searching for Mallone's treasure, the Burglar rents the old Parker home, and after tearing it apart and finding nothing, instead decides to interogate Ben Parker's wife, [[Aunt May|May Parker]], who now resided in a nursing home. Partnering with the nursing home's owner and head doctor, Ludwig Rinehart (actually supervillain [[Mysterio]]) the Burglar and Rinehart take May captive and fake her death. The Burglar's partnership with Rinehart later sours and the two turn on each other, with Rinehart revealing his true nature before beating and imprisoning the Burglar. Escaping Mysterio, who was defeated by Spider-Man, the Burglar eventually meets his end in the same warehouse he first confronted Spider-Man in, where he had been keeping the still alive May Parker. Tracked and confronted by Spider-Man, the Burglar died after suffering a fear-induced heart attack when Spider-Man revealed his true identity as Peter Parker, Ben Parker's nephew, who the Burglar believed was going to kill him as revenge for murdering Ben. <ref> ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #200 </ref>

He had a daughter named Jessica Carradine, a photographer who has a brief relationship with Spider-Man's clone, [[Ben Reilly]]. She believes the murder her father committed was an accident—that the gun Uncle Ben was shot with was his own, which went off by accident during a fight—and that Spider-Man had murdered him. After learning that Ben is Spider-Man, she first threatens to expose him with a photograph she took of him unmasked, but, having witnessed Ben risk his life to save innocent people in a burning skyscraper, decides against it, and gives him the photograph.

== Other Versions ==
=== Ultimate burglar ===

In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', a reimagining of the Spider-Man mythos, the origin story from ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 is reinterpreted over the course of seven issues. Ben Parker's death at the hands of the burglar does not occur until ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #4. The name "Carradine" appears on a list of "known cat burglars," but nothing else is said about it <ref> ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #5 </ref>; it is unknown whether he is actually the burglar who killed Uncle Ben in this universe or is simply another criminal.

=== What If...? ===

Various alternate versions of the Burglar appear throughout the ''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' comic line, most often in stories dealing with Spider-Man's origin being reimagined.

== In other media ==
=== Animation ===

Spider-Man's origin is retold in several of his cartoon appearances, and as a result, the burglar is seen in at least one episode each of ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)]]'', ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)]]'', ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.

=== Film ===
	 
In the film ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'', a robber [[carjack]]s and kills Uncle Ben, rather than breaking into his house. Peter chases him to a warehouse, where the killer trips and falls from a window to his death. The movie credits list the character as "Carjacker", and he is portrayed by [[Michael Papajohn]]. Earlier in the film, Peter lets the robber escape as a subtle way of getting revenge against the fight promoter who cheated him out of money, rather than simply thinking it's "not his job" to stop him.

In ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', it is revealed that the carjacker, now identified as "Dennis Carradine", is not responsible for Ben Parker's death as assumed. The true killer is Flint Marko, who later becomes the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. At the climax of the film, Marko confesses to Peter that he accidentally shot Ben when Carradine bumped into him trying to get into the car. Carradine, a friend and accomplice of Marko, stole the car and left Marko behind to take the fall. Marko escaped, however, and so it was Carradine who died for the crime Marko committed. Flint Marko also admits in the movie that he needs the money he stole to help his daughter who is sick; at the end of the movie Peter/Spider-Man forgives Flint Marko.

=== Video games ===

Dennis Carradine (named "Spike") is the first boss in the game based of the 2002 [[Spider-Man (film)|movie]], he was also stated in a cutsene to be a member of the "Skulls Gang". After beating him, he trips and falls from a window to his death, similar to the film.
