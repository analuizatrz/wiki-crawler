[[Image:Slc_mormon_tempel.jpg|thumb|right|235px|The [[Salt Lake Temple]] of '''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''' is the largest attraction in the city's [[Temple Square]].]]

'''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''', widely known as the '''LDS Church''' or the '''Mormon Church''', is the largest and most well-known [[Religious denomination|denomination]] within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] (a form of [[Restorationism]] founded by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]). The church is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], and has established churches and [[temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]] worldwide, counting nearly 13 million members on its rolls.

Adherents to the church (usually called ''[[Mormon]]s'' or ''Latter-day Saints'') accept [[Jesus]] as the head of their church and count themselves as Christians, but do not consider themselves part of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]], or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions. Instead, they believe that the church is a [[restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of 1st century Christianity. They believe the church is authorized and directed by God through Joseph Smith and his successors, who have introduced new books of scripture to the church's [[Biblical canon]], such as the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. Historically, the church has distinguished itself from traditional Christianity by its former practice of [[polygamy]] (officially discontinued in 1890), and by its unique doctrinal views. In recent decades, however, the church has united with traditional Christian churches in promoting humanitarian and moral causes.

== History of the Church==
{{main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|History of the Latter Day Saint movement|History of Utah}}

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a continuation of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], founded by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] on [[April 6]] [[1830]] in either the [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]]-[[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] area or [[Fayette, New York]].<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>The majority of witnesses say the church was organized [[April 6]] [[1830]] in the log home of Joseph Smith, Sr. in the [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] area, followed by a meeting the next Sunday in nearby [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the home of [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] Nevertheless, one of Smith's histories and a later reminiscence by [[David Whitmer]] say the church was organized at the Whitmer home in Fayette. See [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)]]. The Church refers to Fayette as the place of organization in all its official publications.</ref><!--

--> Joseph Smith established this early church soon after publishing the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. Largely due to the convincing power of this book, which Smith said he translated by a heavenly power, Smith's religion rapidly gained a large following who viewed Smith as a [[prophet]].

In late 1830, Smith envisioned a [[Zion (Latter Day Saint movement)|"city of Zion"]] in [[Native American]] lands near [[Independence, Missouri]], and sent his second-in-command [[Oliver Cowdery]] on an exploratory mission to the area. Awaiting the results of this mission, he temporarily moved his followers to [[Kirtland, Ohio]], where missionaries had converted a congregation of [[Disciples of Christ]] led by [[Sidney Rigdon]]. In Ohio, the church built [[Kirtland Temple|its first temple]], and grew in size.

Though many of Smith's followers attempted to colonize Missouri, the church was never able to gain a foothold, because of opposition to the religion by other Missouri settlers. Soon after Smith moved there in 1838, the [[Mormon War]] ensued, [[Lilburn W. Boggs|the governor of Missouri]] signed an [[Extermination Order (Mormonism)|Extermination Order]] expelling adherents from the state. The church then established its new headquarters in a city built on drained swampland in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], with Smith as mayor. The religion built a [[Nauvoo Temple|new temple]] in Nauvoo, and thrived there until Smith and his brother Hyrum (who was then the Assistant President of the church, and Smith's second-in-command) were [[death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed by a mob]] on [[June 27]] [[1844]], while awaiting trial for destroying a [[Nauvoo Expositor|local newspaper]] that said Smith was practicing a form of [[polygamy]] and that he intended to establish himself as a theocratic king. Smith, at the time was a minor candidate for [[President of the United States]].

After Joseph and Hyrum's death, several church leaders campaigned to lead the church during a time known as the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|Succession Crisis]]. The majority of adherents accepted the succession claims of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], led by [[Brigham Young]], and the modern Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the denomination of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] representing that faction who followed Young.

After continued difficulties in Illinois, Brigham Young left Nauvoo in 1846, and led his followers (called the [[Mormon pioneers]] during this period) to the [[Rocky Mountains]], then part of [[Mexico]], which later became [[Utah]], and began to colonize the area with numerous small cities. Young initially governed his followers as a [[theocracy]]; however, word of the Mormons' formerly-secret practice of [[plural marriage]] (a form of [[polygamy]]) soon got back to [[Washington, D.C.]], and in 1857, United States federal troops [[Utah War|peacefully deposed Young]] and replaced him with [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|a non-Mormon territorial governor]]. Over the [[polygamy]] issue, hostility between the church and the United States steadily increased until 1890, when church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] officially [[1890 Manifesto|disavowed the practice]] on behalf of the church. This disavowel resulted in a few minor [[schism]]s.

Church relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890. Polygamy ceased ''officially'' in 1890, and though the church conducted a number of secret plural marriages in Mexico into the 1900s, polygamy ceased ''in practice'' around 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] testified before the [[United States Congress]] during the [[Reed Smoot hearings]] that the church was not conducting new polygamous marriages. Also that year, the church issued a "Second Manifesto" reiterating its disavowel of the practice. Since about the 1930s, the church has adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy, and has encouraged laws in the United States making the practice a felony.

During the [[20th century]] and continuing today, the Church has undergone a period of nearly exponential growth, due to a high birth rate and extensive [[proselytism]]. Additionally, the Church has gained more prominence and has taken firm stands on a number of social issues: supporting [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], opposing [[gambling]], and opposing [[abortion]] (with some exceptions),<ref>{{cite press release

==Beliefs and practices ==
{{see also|Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)}}
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have many beliefs in common with [[Catholic]], [[Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] traditions.  Some of the major differences in belief are mentioned here; for more detailed information see [[Mormonism and Christianity]].

===Jesus Christ===
{{main|Jesus}}
[[Image:Christus statue temple square salt lake city.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Latter-day Saints believe in the resurrected Jesus Christ, as depicted in the Christus Statue in the North Visitors' Center on [[Temple Square]] in [[Salt Lake City]]]] 

The church teaches that [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] is the [[son of God]], who taught all His [[gospel]] and the way to return to live with [[God the Father]]. Christ's [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]], [[Atonement#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|atonement]], [[Crucifixion|death]] and [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] provide the means whereby God's children can be [[Resurrection|resurrected]] and [[Atonement (ransom view)|redeemed]] from their [[sin]]s through [[repentance]]. The church teaches that after the death of Christ and [[Twelve Apostles|His apostles]], the priesthood authority was lost and some important doctrinal teachings were [[Early Christianity|changed]] [[Fathers of Christian Gnosticism|over]] [[First Council of Nicaea|time]] from Christ's [[Synoptic Gospels|original teachings]]; thus [[Great Apostasy|necessitating]] a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of His Church and true doctrines before the [[Second Coming]].

===The Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr.===
{{main|Joseph Smith, Jr.}}
The Church teaches that Jesus Christ and God the Father [[Theophany|appeared]] [[First Vision|to Joseph Smith, Jr.]], instructing him to begin the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|reestablishment]] of [[Ministry of Jesus|Christ's Church]] on earth as prophesied in {{lds|Acts|acts|3|19|21}}.  Joseph Smith, Jr. wrote that Christ had called him to be a [[End times|latter-day]] [[Prophet#Latter-day Saint concept of prophets|Prophet]] to tell people of the [[Agape|gospel message]] and restore the [[Priesthood (Mormonism)|authority]] from Christ to [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|perform acts]] in His name.<ref>>{{lds|The Pearl of Great Price, "Joseph Smith - History"|js_h|1|}}</ref>  According to the LDS Church, the unique doctrines taught by the Church are a result of [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] received from God by Joseph Smith, Jr. and his successors.<ref>Gordon B. Hinckley, “The Great Things Which God Has Revealed,” Ensign, May 2005, 80</ref><ref>Thomas S. Monson, “The Prophet Joseph Smith: Teacher by Example,” Ensign, November 2005, 67</ref><ref>James E.

McConkie, “Joseph Smith—The Mighty Prophet of the Restoration,” Ensign, May 1976, 94</ref>

===Nature of God===
{{main|Godhead (Latter Day Saints)}}

The Church teaches of Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]]. They are three separate and distinct beings who together constitute the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]], united in purpose rather than [[Trinity|in substance]]. All three members of the Godhead are eternal and equally divine, but have different roles. While the Holy Ghost is a spirit without a physical body, God the Father and Christ both possess distinct, perfected, physical bodies of flesh and bone.<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|130|22}}</ref> God the Father is the spirit father in premortal life of the spirits of all people who are, have been, will be born on this earth.<ref>{{lds|Abraham|abr|3|21|26}}, {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|93|29}}</ref>  He is also both the spirit Father and the Father in the flesh of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is thus the Only Begotten Son, inheriting from His Father power over death. Since Christ is omniscient and has the same purpose as the Father, the church teaches that Jesus Christ speaks often in the scriptures as though knowing perfectly the will and the words of the Father.<ref>{{lds|John|john|12|49|50}}, {{lds|John|john|14}}, {{lds|Matthew|matt|26|39}}</ref> [[Nontrinitarianism]] is a point of disagreement with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] traditions. Official church materials refer to "Heavenly Parents," implying the existence of a Heavenly Mother.<ref>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=f04a7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 "Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family"], ''Gospel Principles'', 11 (1997).</ref> Belief in such a figure is common among members, and she has also been mentioned in talks by church officials, as well as in the hymns of the church.<ref>Spencer W.

===Purpose of life===
{{main|Plan of Salvation}}

The term ''[[Plan of Salvation]]'' is used by the LDS Church to describe how the gospel of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is designed to bring about the immortality and eternal life of mankind.<ref>See also {{lds|Moses|moses|1|39}}.</ref>

The Church teaches that prior to being born, everyone on earth lived with Heavenly Father (God) as his spirit child.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|93|29}}</ref><ref>{{lds|Moses|3|5}}</ref>  After progressing up to a certain point, further learning and progress was not possible without taking on a mortal body and going through trials while largely separated from God's presence and influence.   All those born on this earth were the ones who endorsed Christ's offer to facilitate God's [[Plan of Salvation]] involving free-agency as opposed to a plan of forced obedience.  As a condition of being born into mortality, each person agreed to have nearly all memory of the pre-mortal life erased so as to facilitate the exercise of free-agency as well as test the humility and faith of each individual.  In confirming this, the [[Book of Mormon]] teaches "...this life [is] a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God..."(Alma 12:24).

Further encapsulating the purpose of life are the verses taken from the [[Book of Abraham]] where the Creator says:
“...We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;”<ref>See {{lds|Abraham|3|24-25}}</ref>

The Church teaches that all of humanity will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected]] and receive  [[immortality]] as a gift made possible by Jesus' death and [[resurrection]].<ref>See {{lds|1 Corinthians|1_cor|15|22}}</ref>

Following the resurrection all will be [[Last Judgment|judged]] by Jesus Christ. As part of this judgment, each person will be assigned to one of three heavenly kingdoms (sometimes called [[Degrees of Glory]]): the [[Celestial Kingdom]],<ref>See {{lds|Romans|rom|8|17}}</ref> the [[Terrestrial Kingdom]],<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|76|74}}</ref> and the [[Telestial Kingdom]].<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|76|110}}</ref>
 
The Church also teaches that those people who have not had an opportunity to hear the doctrines of Jesus Christ during life on Earth will have the opportunity to do so prior to the judgment.

===Eschatology===
Latter-day Saints teach [[Millennialism]], in which, after a period of [[tribulation]], the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]] will occur, followed by a [[millennium|thousand years]] of peace, after which will occur the [[Last Judgment]]. Distinctive within Latter-day millennialism, however, is the idea that [[Jesus]] will reign "personally upon the earth" ({{lds|Article of Faith|a_of_f|1|10}}), and direct the government or governments that will exist.<ref>Berrett, William E, Teachings of the Doctrine and Covenants, 1956, Ch. 42, p.280</ref> [[Jackson County, Missouri]] is expected to have an important LDS temple during the Millennium, and [[Jerusalem]] is expected to be an important center of government in the world.<ref>Brewster, Hoyt W, Isaiah Plain and Simple: The Message of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon, 1995, Ch. 2, p.10-13</ref> As the earth transitions into the Millennial period, only those good and honorable people who stand to inherit the [[Celestial Kingdom]] or [[Terrestrial Kingdom]] will continue on the earth, because all others will either repent or die by means of disasters and in-fighting among themselves.<ref>Smith, Joseph Fielding, Doctrines of Salvation, Vol. 3, 1956, Ch. 3, pg. 38-42</ref>

===Theology of family and gender===
{{see also |Eternal Marriage|The Family: A Proclamation to the World|Family Home Evening}}

The LDS Church teaches that, through the [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinances]] of the restored gospel, families can be [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]] together so that spouses may remain together after death and live together eternally. Not only do spouses live together forever,  LDS doctrine also teaches that children continue in that familial bond in the afterlife; only marriages and sealings performed in LDS temples will continue after death.  Therefore, the Church teaches that all who qualify will be sealed by proxy where living people are sealed vicariously on behalf of those that have died without being sealed. 

Because of these beliefs, the LDS Church places a strong emphasis on the importance of the family to individuals and society. In particular, the Church views the [[nuclear family]] (father, mother and children) as the most important single unit in the Church, as well as in society. In [[1995]], the [[First Presidency]] and the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] published ''[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]'', a document explaining major LDS doctrine concerning the family. LDS Church leaders and doctrine support the traditional definitions of family and marriage, including opposing same-sex marriage<ref>[http://lds.org/newsroom/showrelease/0,15503,4028-1-23860,00.html ''First Presidency letter to Church leaders, 1994''], The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</ref> and supporting the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].<ref>LDS.org Newsroom. {{cite web | url=http://www.lds.org/newsroom/showrelease/0,15503,4028-1-23253,00.html | title=Church Supports Call for Constitutional Amendment|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

In the early part of the 20th century, Church members were counseled to set aside [[Monday]] night as a time to dedicate to their own families. No other church meetings were to be held on this night. The Church still encourages members to meet Monday nights in a ''[[Family Home Evening]]'' to pray, read scriptures, and engage in other familial recreational activities.

===Priesthood===
{{seealso|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}
The LDS Church teaches that the authority to act in God's name is called the Priesthood. [[Laity|All worthy male members]] of the Church may hold the Priesthood and are expected to use it righteously to serve and bless their families and others. Holding the priesthood is a stated prerequisite to hold offices within the hierarchy of the church as the Priesthood provides the authority to officiate and preside over the Church, or portions of the Church. The Church further teaches that this authority was given to Joseph Smith by [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]]. Smith was instructed to organize the Church<ref name="intro">[http://www.mormon.org/learn/0,8672,955-1,00.html Introduction to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]. ''Mormon.org.''</ref> and to confer the Priesthood on others. The LDS Church holds [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] as the successor to Joseph Smith Jr. and the person who has the Priesthood authority to preside over and receive revelation for the Church as a whole.

The Church teaches that one such revelation was received by [[Spencer W. Kimball]] in 1978, when he directed that all worthy men be ordained to the priesthood. This changed a long tradition, from 1849 until 1978, that men of African descent<ref>People of other dark-skinned ethnicities not of [[Africa|African]] descent (such as the [[Māori]]) received the priesthood during this time.</ref> were not permitted to receive the priesthood or marry in the temple, although they could become members and hold [[Calling (Mormonism)|callings]] within the Church. See ''[[Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]'' and ''[[Blacks and Mormonism]]''

Some women claimed to hold the priesthood through their husbands because of temple ordinances; however, this is not Church doctrine. <ref>Lucy Meserve Smith (1817-1892) in "Historical Narrative" manuscript, published on page 268 of "Women's Voices" (1982) by Kenneth Godfrey, Audrey M. Godfrey, Jill Mulvany Derr. Deseret Books, ISBN 0-87747-909-7</ref>  The Church teaches that women cannot receive the Priesthood, but places strong emphasis on the importance of motherhood. Motherhood is considered one of the most sacred responsibilities. The Church also teaches that God listens to and answers the prayers of his daughters.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The [[feminist movement]] has been displeased with the fact that women are unable to hold the priesthood.  See ''[[Women and Mormonism]]''

The LDS Church also teaches that the priesthood is divided into two parts: the '''[[Aaronic Priesthood]]''' and the ''[[Melchizedek Priesthood]]''. The Aaronic Priesthood (also called the Levitical Priesthood), is considered to be a lesser priesthood tracing its roots to [[Aaron]] the brother of [[Moses]] through [[John the Baptist]]. [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] said that they received this Priesthood on [[May 15]], [[1829]], when they were ordained by [[John the Baptist]].<ref>Messenger and Advocate, 1(1), October 1, 1834.</ref> In 1835, Smith and Cowdery clarified that this authority was the "Aaronic, or Levitical priesthood".<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|3|2}}.</ref> 

The Melchizedek Priesthood, or, the "Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God"<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|3}}</ref> is recognized as a "higher" order of priesthood, or the [[High Priest (Mormonism)|"high priesthood"]] and takes its name from [[Melchizedek]] who "was such a great high priest".<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|3|1}}.</ref> This priesthood was thought to be the order of priesthood held by [[Jesus]], and a distinction is made between the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, which derives in part from the ''[[Epistle to the Hebrews]]'', whose author argues that [[Jesus]] arose "after the order of Melchizedek, and not...after the order of Aaron."<ref>{{lds|Heb|heb|7|11}}</ref>

===Ordinances===
Latter-day Saint [[Sacrament]]s are called [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinances]]. Latter-day Saints believe in two types of ordinances: saving ordinances and non-saving ordinances. Saving ordinances, such as baptism, confirmation, plus temple [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] and [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealing]] are required for entry into the [[Celestial Kingdom]]. Non-saving ordinances include various types of blessings and the "sacrament" (the Latter-day Saint version of the [[Eucharist]] or Communion). Ordination to a priesthood office is also considered to be an ordinance.

The Church practices [[baptism#Latter-day Saint baptism|baptism]] by immersion in water. Baptism is symbolic of burial, resurrection, and spiritual rebirth as a disciple of Jesus Christ. The Church teaches that a person who truly repents and is baptized has all prior sins remitted through [[divine grace]].

A person is eligible for baptism beginning at age eight. According to church doctrine, the age of eight was given in latter-day revelation as the age when children become accountable for their sins, that is, they are able to discern between right and wrong. If a person dies who is unable to distinguish between right and wrong (e.g. infants and those with severe intellectual impairment), he or she is viewed as fully saved through the Atonement of Christ. ''The Book of Mormon'' and modern revelation specifically forbid the practice of [[pedobaptism|infant baptism]].<ref>See {{lds|D&C|dc|68|27}} and {{lds|Moroni|moro|8|4|23}}.</ref> Baptism is recognized only when performed by one holding at least the office of a Priest in the Aaronic Priesthood, thus baptisms from other churches are not accepted since the Church believes that it alone possesses priesthood authority.

Following baptism by immersion, individuals are confirmed members of the Church and given the gift of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]] by the laying on of hands by [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]]-bearers. This blessing entitles the newly confirmed recipient to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as a guide and guardian so long as the recipient lives worthy of the gift. Accompanying this gift, are the gifts of the Spirit, enumerated in {{lds|1 Cor.|1_cor|12}}{{lds|&nbsp;&mdash;|1_cor|13}}, {{lds|D&C|dc|46}}, and {{lds|Moroni|moro|10}} (emphasized in this last chapter of the Book of Mormon). Members believe that those who have not been confirmed may still receive inspiration and a witness from the Holy Ghost but are not entitled to the constant companionship available through the gift of the Holy Ghost.

=== Donations of time and service ===
{{See also|Perfection (Latter Day Saints)}}
:''See also [[#Worship and Culture|Worship and Culture]] below''
Latter-day Saints have a high degree of participation outside of worship services. Active church membership generally entails missionary work, family history, participation in church callings, [[Family Home Evening]], and payment of [[tithe]]s. Other forms of charity are encouraged, including donations of money, clothing and time. The Church teaches its members should be self sufficient and avoid falling into debt.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|104|78}}</ref><ref>Benson, Ezra Taft. "Pay Thy Debt, and Live." ''Ensign''. June 1987: p. 3. {{cite web | url=http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1987.htm/ensign%20june%201987.htm/first%20presidency%20message%20pay%20thy%20debt%20and%20live%20.htm | title=Available online. | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> 

The ''[[tithe|Law of Tithing]]'' states that members are expected to give 10% of their income to the Church. These funds are used to build meetinghouses and other buildings, to cover operating costs, education, produce materials for use in church classes and organizations, support the missionary program, and to support family history work and other church functions.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1095-1,00.html  The law of tithing]. ''Mormon.org''.</ref>
   
''[[Fast offering]]s'' (named for their collection each month after [[fasting]] for two meals) are generally expected to be a minimum of the cost of food for the monthly day of fast practiced by members and go towards [[humanitarian aid]]. Payment of generous fast offerings is highly recommended.<ref>[Victor L. Brown, “Fast Offerings: Fulfilling Our Responsibility to Others,” Ensign, May 1981, 37]</ref>

===Lifestyle code===
The church has a lifestyle code, which includes the [[Word of Wisdom]] (a health code originally given as a warning with a promise of health by encouraging healthy eating and discouraging the unhealthy use of alcohol, tobacco, and coffee/tea.  Later, in 1851, it was given as a commandment),<ref>Doctrine and Covenants section 89</ref> the law of [[chastity]] before marriage, complete fidelity after marriage, and a requirement to obey the laws of the country in which the member lives. 

The church condemns abortion and encourages a standard of [[modesty]]. With permission from a Bishop, members may procure an abortion in the case of rape or incest. Members with gay, lesbian, or bisexual desires are officially welcomed in the church, but only if they choose to control their sexual desires (which are deemed inappropriate by the church) and remain celibate or heterosexually married and monogamous. Transgendered persons are officially accepted in the church, but may not hold a priesthood office if they are post-operative, or if they are considering sexual reassignment surgery. (1999 Church handbook.)

The church considers "serious" cases to include felonies, abortion, drugs, non-heterosexual or non-married sex, apostasy, or public and vocal criticism of church leaders.
Church members who fail to live the church's lifestyle code may, in more serious cases, be subject to church disciplinary action including disfellowshipment or even excommunication as part of the repentance process.  Such individuals are encouraged to continue attending church services, but are not permitted to pay tithing, hold callings, or offer public prayer at any church meeting.  Other members are frequently unaware of the status of such individuals.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Ensign

===Origin of Native Americans===
{{main|Book of Mormon}}
Latter-day Saints believe in a covenant relationship between God and the House of Israel, as described in the Old Testament.<ref>Smith, Joseph Fielding, Doctrines of Salvation, Vol. 3, Ch. 13 (pp. 244-264)</ref> As stated in the introduction to the [[Book of Mormon]], they believe that [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] are included in this covenant, and that some are descended from members of two of the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] (the tribes of Ephraim & Manasseh) that migrated to the Americas shortly before the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BC, and also from another group of Israelites that migrated after the city's fall. 

Controversy has developed regarding this belief as a result of recent [[Genetics and the Book of Mormon|genetic research]].

===America as Promised Land===
A more expansive view of the Americas as a covenant land for people of whatever origin whose ancestors have been led by the "hand of the Lord" to settle there is included in Lehi's prophecy in the Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 1:5-7:  "Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord... That there shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.  Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring... Unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever."

===African Americans and Mormonism===
The controversy regarding [[Blacks and Mormonism]] has begun to be dissipated since the 1978 revelation announced by letter on June 8 under the direction of LDS President Spencer W. Kimball.  The letter stated that "the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows therefrom, including the blessings of the temple." (Doctrine and Covenants, Official Declaration 2) This helped to fulfill the promise to Abraham that "thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations; ...and in thy seed after thee ...shall all the families of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal." (Abraham 2:9,11)

===Area Conferences in Diverse Locations===

LDS members in many parts of the world occasionally receive visits to area conferences from one of the Twelve Apostles, the Seventy, the First Presidency of the Church, or other leaders who provide encouragement and counsel.  The messages are translated into the native language(s) of the area.  These meetings are attended by tens of thousands of LDS members of many ethnic backgrounds.

== Sacred texts and other publications ==
[[Image:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Standard Works]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints printed in the ''Quadruple Combination'' format]]

The Church accepts as [[biblical canon|canon]]: the ''[[Bible]]'' (as "as far as it is translated correctly),<ref>See the Ninth [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Article of Faith]] (lds|A of F|a_of_f|1|9}}</ref> the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', the ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'' and the ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]].'' The four are considered the ''[[Standard Works]]''. The church also publishes numerous periodicals, manuals, and sometimes "proclamations", which are not scripture, but clarify its teachings.

===Holy Bible===
{{see also|Bible}}
The church has articulated its position on the ''[[Bible]]'', in the words of Joseph Smith, Jr. "We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly".<ref>See the Ninth [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Article of Faith]] (lds|A of F|a_of_f|1|9}}</ref> Smith used the ''[[King James Version of the Bible]]'' (KJV), but considered the [[Bible translations|translation]] to have omissions and mistranslations; thus he began the ''[[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]]'' (sometimes called the ''Inspired Version'').

===Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ===
[[Image:Book of Mormon English Missionary Edition Soft Cover.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The church's latest edition of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]: Another Testament of Jesus Christ'']]
{{main|Book of Mormon}}
The ''[[Book of Mormon]]: Another Testament of Jesus Christ'' is also considered canon. The book is named after one of the prophet/historians, [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]], who, according to the text compiled most of the book onto gold plates. It was first published by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in March 1830 in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]].  The book describes itself as being written by ancient [[prophet]]s of the [[Western Hemisphere]] who traveled there from ancient [[Israel]] circa 600 BC. The church teaches that the [[Golden Plates|gold plates]] were delivered to him by [[angel Moroni|an angel]], and that Smith translated the record by divine inspiration with assistance from the [[Urim and Thummim]]. Joseph Smith Jr. said he returned the plates to the angel, identified as [[angel Moroni|Moroni]].

===Doctrine and Covenants===
{{Main|Doctrine and Covenants}}
First Published in 1835, ''The Doctrine and Covenants'' is a collection of revelations, policies, letters, and statements given to the modern Church, mostly by Smith. This record contains Church doctrine as well as direction on Church government.  It is also considered to be canon.

===Pearl of Great Price===
{{Main|Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)}}
''The Pearl of Great Price'' is a compilation of several books.  The "[[Book of Moses]]", which contains an excerpt from Smith's translation of [[Genesis]].  "Joseph Smith&mdash;Matthew" contains his translation of {{lds|Matthew|matt|24}}.  The "[[Book of Abraham]]" was derived from Egyptian papyrus that came into Smith's possession in 1835.<ref>Peterson, H Donl, Story of the Book of Abraham, 1995, Ch. 19</ref>  "Joseph Smith&mdash;History" is an excerpt from ''The Documentary History of the Church'' containing a letter written by Joseph Smith in 1838.  Lastly, the "[[Articles of Faith]]" is an excerpt from [[The Wentworth Letter|another of Smith's letters]] which contain thirteen statements of belief and doctrine.<ref>See {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1}}</ref> The Pearl of Great Price completes the church's canon.

===Non-canonical publications===
[[Image:77245_April2006Ensign_tn.jpg|right|thumb|The [[May]] [[2006]] issue of [[Ensign (magazine)|Ensign]] magazine, featuring [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], current President of the Church.]]
The ''[[Ensign (magazine)|Ensign]]'' is an official [[magazine]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The magazine was first issued in January 1971 along with the ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'' (for youth) and the ''[[The Friend (Mormon magazine)|Friend]]'' (for children), all of which replaced the older church publications ''[[Improvement Era]]'', ''[[Relief Society Magazine]]'', ''[[Woman's Exponent]]'', the ''[[Instructor (magazine)|Instructor]]'', and the ''[[Millennial Star]]''. Unlike some of its predecessors, the ''Ensign'' contains no [[Advertising|advertisements]]. Content includes faith-promoting and proselytizing information, stories, and sermons.<ref>The full text and page layout of past and current issues are available on the Church's web site.{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/gospellibrary/pdfindex/0,7777,579-1,00.html|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|title=Church Publications}}</ref>

Semiannually, the ''Ensign'' gives a full report of the proceedings of the annual and semi-annual [[LDS General Conference]]s of the Church.  It contains the full text of the talks and business of the conferences, as well as a current photographic list of the highest officers of the Church, referred to as the [[General Authority|General Authorities]].

''[[Liahona]]'' is also the name of the official international magazine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, named after an object used to guide the people in the Book of Mormon. The ''Liahona'' is regularly published in fifty different languages, from two to twelve times a year depending on the language. It contains material that is mostly for adults and is translated from articles in the ''Ensign'' magazine. It also contains stories from the [[New Era]] and [[The Friend (Mormon magazine)|Friend]] for readers of the respective age groups.

[[Image:Mormon Church in Puerto Princesa.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Latter-day Saint chapel in [[Puerto Princesa City|Puerto Princesa, Philippines]] ]]

[[Deseret Management Corporation]], a for-profit company which is owned by the church operates several companies which publish material:
* [[Deseret Book]]. Deseret Book is independently managed and publishes under four imprints and different media. Published materials include: doctrinal non-fiction books, [[LDS fiction]] books, electronic resources and sound recordings. Deseret Book also owns a chain of LDS [[bookstores]] in the western United States. 
* ''[[Deseret Morning News]]''. Utah's second largest daily newspaper is published in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] and is [[Utah]]'s oldest continually published daily newspaper. The newspaper is printed by [[Newspaper Agency Corporation]], which it co-owns with the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' under a [[joint operating agreement]]. ''Deseret News'' also publishes a weekly publication, the ''LDS Church News'', which is included each Saturday and distributed by mail as a separate publication outside Utah.
* [[Bonneville International]] owns and independently manages 1 television and over 30 radio stations in 8 cities within the [[United States]].

== Worship and Culture ==
[[Image:LDS_Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The chapel in the [[Joseph Smith Memorial Building]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Although within a downtown office building, it still follows the standard design of LDS chapels throughout the world.]]
===Worship services=== 
{{main|Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

Weekly worship services, including sacrament meetings, are held on Sundays (or Saturday when local custom or law prohibits Sunday worship), in neighborhood-based religious units, and twice each year the Church holds a worldwide General Conference.  [[congregation (worship)|Congregations]] for Sunday services are grouped geographically, with larger (~200 to ~400 people) congregations known as [[Ward (Mormonism)|wards]], and smaller (two through ~200 people) congregations known as branches.  These neighborhood congregations meet in meetinghouses, also referred to as "chapels" or "stake centers", on property most often owned by the Church.  In some geographic areas, rental property may be used as a meetinghouse.  Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a "chapel", the room used as a chapel for religious services is actually only one component of the standard meetinghouse.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/virtualchapel/virtualchapel.html A church-maintained virtual tour of a typical meetinghouse]</ref>

All persons, regardless of their beliefs or their standing in or out of the Church, are allowed to attend.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/question/worship/1,8578,797-1,00.html Open invitation to attend church, on Church-maintained website]</ref> The [[Sacrament (Mormonism)|sacrament]] (similar to Communion, the Lord's Supper, or the [[Eucharist]] in other churches) is offered weekly to the members of the church. Except on Mondays, which are reserved for [[Family Home Evening]], members meet in meetinghouses for various activities throughout the week.

Women usually attend wearing skirts or dresses, while men wear suits or dress shirts (preferably white) and ties.  Children are also typically in their "Sunday best."<ref>Mormon.org. {{cite web | url=http://mormon.org/book/0,9768,826-1,00.html | title=What to expect at Sunday meetings | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

=== Temple worship ===

{{main|Temple (Latter Day Saints)}}

Two years after the organization of the Church, in 1832, Joseph Smith, Jr., reported receiving a revelation that called upon church members to build a ''House of the Lord'' and restore the practice of temple worship.<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/124/47,51,72,145#31 Doctrine & Covenants 124:31]</ref> The Church built its [[Kirtland Temple|first temple]] in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], [[Ohio]] in 1836.  This temple was used primarily for instruction and learning.<ref>Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Vol.2, KIRTLAND TEMPLE</ref>

[[Image:363px-Bern Tempel 20 Jan 1981.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bern Switzerland Temple]], dedicated in 1955, was the first LDS temple in Europe]]
In 1846 the [[Nauvoo Temple]] was built in [[Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]].  With this temple came the introduction of special ordinances, such as the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] and [[baptism for the dead]].<ref>Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Vol.3, NAUVOO TEMPLE — ''see'' [[Ordinance (Mormonism)]]</ref>  When the saints moved West to Utah, they were forced to abandon these temples.  The Nauvoo temple was destroyed by fire and the Kirtland temple is owned by the [[Community of Christ]].  

Soon after the arrival of the Saints in the Rocky Mountains, they began building several temples, including the well known [[Salt Lake Temple]], which took more than 40 years to complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1---2-119,00.html |title=Granite and Faith: The Story of the Salt Lake Temple |accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> The Church continued to build temples as membership grew. {{LDS Temple status}}  ''See [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]''.

Today faithful members of the Church are encouraged to regularly attend [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]] and participate in [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinances]] there, such as [[baptism for the dead]]. The Church teaches that certain temple ordinances, including being married in the temple, are necessary for eternal exaltation. The Church also regards the temples as places of peace and refuge that are set apart from the world. Adult members who have performed a temple ordinance called an [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] also receive a [[Temple garment (Mormonism)|temple garment]], which they wear under their daily clothing.  The Church considers the temple ordinances exceptionally sacred and does not discuss them publicly. Non-members or members without a temple recommend are not permitted to attend or observe these ordinances. For a member to receive a temple recommend they must be worthy. However, the general public, member or non member, is invited to attend an open house of the temple prior to its dedication.

===General Conference===
{{main|General conference (Mormonism)}}

Twice a year (Spring and Autumn), the Church holds [[General conference (Mormonism)|General Conference]], in which the Prophet and other leaders speak from [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake City, Utah.  These talks, given in several sessions over two days, are carried worldwide by radio, television, satellite and Internet broadcasts.  They are translated into numerous languages, and are later made available on DVD (complete with translations) and also printed in Church publications such as [[Ensign (magazine)|Ensign]] and [[Liahona]].  Attendees come from around the world.

[[Image:LDS Conference Center interior panoramic.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Interior of the [[LDS Conference Center]] where the Church holds its semi-annual [[General Conference (Mormonism)|General Conference]]]]

Conference talks address doctrinal topics drawn from scriptures and personal experiences, messages of faith and hope, Church history and information on the Church as it expands throughout the world.  

Throughout the 20th century, Conference talks were given from the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]].  With a maximum capacity of about 8,000 per session, the Tabernacle would be filled and thousands of other attendees would sit on blankets on Temple Square lawns.  In 2001, the [[LDS Conference Center]] was opened, and since that time talks have been given in the Center's 22,000-seat main auditorium.

Conference satellite broadcasts may be watched, live, in thousands of chapels worldwide.  The public is invited to attend General Conference, either through these broadcasts, in the Conference Center or other areas at Temple Square.

===Culture===
{{Main article |Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, a distinct culture has grown up around members of the Church. It is primarily concentrated in the [[Rocky Mountains]], but as membership of the Church spreads around the world, many of its more distinctive practices, such as following the [[Word of Wisdom]], a health code prohibiting the consumption of [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], [[coffee]] and [[tea]], and other addictive substances, follow.<ref>See Doctrine & Covenants, Section 89.</ref>  Because of the prohibition on such things as tobacco and alcohol, the culture in high Mormon populations reflects these restrictions.<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619]. Salt Lake Tribune Editorial, ''Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse''.</ref> The Church discourages gambling in all forms including [[lottery|lotteries]].<ref>[http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,89-1-520-21,00.html Gambling]. Gordon B. Hinckley, ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''.</ref>

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of the Latter-day Saint culture.

====Young men and women====
Young men and women aged 12 to 18 often have an additional meeting during the week (previously referred to as Mutual or MIA, which were short for ''Mutual Improvement Association''), which can involve an activity, game, service project, or instruction. The young men and women may meet separately or take part in a combined activity. Usually, the young men participate in [[Boy Scouts of America|Scouting]], including efforts to gain the [[List of BSA religious emblems|Duty to God]] award and an award unique to the LDS Church, "On my Honor." Young women participate in a program titled [[Personal Progress]]. Both the young men and the young women try to live by the standards outlined in [[For the Strength of Youth]].

====Institute of Religion====

{{main|Institute of Religion}}

There are several LDS Institutes of Religion in the United States which are mostly close to colleges and universities. There are several religion classes which are offered for free in these institutes. Besides that, it is a place for young students to associate with other young Latter-day Saints and have activities.

====Home, family, and personal enrichment====
Four times a year the adult women (members of the Church's [[Relief Society]]) attend a Home, Family, and Personal Enrichment Meeting (formerly known as Homemaking Meeting). The meeting may consist of a service project, or of attending a social event, or of various classes being offered. In addition, Enrichment activities are offered (weekly, monthly, or as determined by ward Relief Society leaders) for women with similar needs and interests. <!-- Is this right? I thought HFPE and Enrichment was the same thing, and that it was pretty much always once a month. -->

====Social events and gatherings====
[[Image:PSP 028.jpg|thumb|LDS stake center. Stake centers serve as meetinghouses for local congregations and headquarters for the local stake.]]
In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes.  The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations.  Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve the building for personal or family use, to accommodate such events as music recitals, family reunions, weddings and receptions, birthdays, or funerals.

====Media Community====
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for LDS media. The largest of these communities are [[LDS cinema]], and LDS Fiction, LDS websites, and LDS graphical art like photography and paintings. The church owns a bookstore called [[Deseret Book]] which provides an avenue for much of this media to be sold. This culture also resides outside of heavily mormon populations and many LDS bookstores exist near many temples where many members commonly visit. Some of the titles that have become popular outside of the LDS community are the "Work and the Glory" series of novels, and "Other Side of Heaven" movie. There are a number of titles that have become huge successes within the LDS community. These titles generally elaborate on LDS culture or historical fiction in some manner.

==Church organization and leadership==
===Name of the Church===
[[Image:Logo_of_the_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_(1995).gif|thumb|left|The Church's official [[logo]] since 1995]] [[Image:LDS church office building.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Church office building in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]]]]
When the Church was organized in 1830 it was called the ''[[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]''. It was also referred to as the ''Church of Latter Day Saints'' to differentiate the church of this era from that of the New Testament, and was generally known by that name between 1834 and 1838. In April 1838, the full name was stated as '' The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints''.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|115|3|4}}</ref> When the Church was incorporated in 1851, the legal documents used the current standardized spelling and punctuation, capitalizing the first article, "The", and hyphenating "Latter-day": ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''. There was no standard spelling or punctuation for its official title in church publications prior to 1851, so "the" may sometimes be capitalized or sometimes not in early publications.  The Church currently uses the word "The" as part of its official name, as opposed to a modifying [[Article (grammar)|article]]. 

The Church is also known as the ''LDS Church'' and the ''Mormon Church''. Church members are known as ''Mormons'' or ''Latter-day Saints'', both being appellations accepted among Latter-day Saints themselves. The nickname "[[Mormon]]" arose soon after the publication of ''[[The Book of Mormon]]'' in 1830. Although originally used [[pejorative|pejoratively]] to refer to the Church or its members, the term came to be used widely within the Church.

The Church requests that the official name, ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', be used where possible, stating: "This full name was given by revelation from God to Joseph Smith in 1838."<ref name="styleguide">[http://www.lds.org/newsroom/page/0,15606,3899-1---15-168,00.html A style guide] issued by the Church in 2001</ref> It also encourages the use of "the Church" or "the Church of Jesus Christ" as shortened references, although "LDS Church" is commonly used within the Church's own publications and the Church officially uses "Mormon" as a descriptive term for itself in the name of the ''[[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]]''. When referring to members of the Church, it suggests "Latter-day Saints" as preferred, although "Mormons" is acceptable.<ref name="styleguide" /> Despite these efforts, the [[Associated Press]] continues to recommend "Mormon Church" as a proper second reference in its ''Style Guide'' for journalists.
<!--This is important to the terms used within the article and other articles in the Wikipedia:WikiProject Latter Day Saint movement. -->

=== Legal entities ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally incorporated in 1851. That corporation, however, was dissolved by an act of the [[United States Congress]] in 1887 because of the church's practice (now abandoned) of [[polygamy]]. Thereafter, the church has continued to operate as an "unincorporated religious association". However, the church has organized several tax-exempt corporations to assist with the transfer of money and capital. These include the ''Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', organized in 1916 under the laws of the state of [[Utah]] to acquire, hold, and dispose of [[real property]]. In 1923, the church incorporated the ''Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' in [[Utah]] to receive and manage money and church donations. In 1997, the church incorporated [[Intellectual Reserve|Intellectual Reserve, Inc.]] to hold all the church's [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s, and other [[intellectual property]].

=== Priesthood hierarchy ===
The Church has a hierarchical structure, with clearly defined stewardships or realms of responsibility for the various offices. Those who hold such offices do not elect to do so but are "called" by someone of a higher authority.

[[image:Hinckley_message.jpg|right|framed|[[Gordon B. Hinckley]] is regarded by church members as [[God]]'s [[prophet]] upon the Earth today.]] 	 
The leader of the Church is termed [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President]], and church members revere him as a [[Prophet#Latter-day Saint concept of prophets|Prophet]], [[Seer]], and [[Revelation#Latter Day Saint concept of revelation|Revelator]]. The prophet is believed to hold the same divine calling as biblical prophets, and his stewardship is over the Church as a whole. He is entitled to guide the church through revelation, acting as God's veritable mouthpiece. The President of the Church serves as such until death. Historically, the senior apostle has always become the new President of the Church. The current prophet is [[Gordon B. Hinckley]].

The [[First Presidency]], the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles|Quorum of the Twelve]] [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostles]], the [[Presiding Bishop|Presiding Bishopric]] and the [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|First and Second Quorums of the Seventy]] are all referred to as ''[[General Authorities]]'' because they direct the work of the entire church throughout the world. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are sustained as Prophets, Seers, and Revelators. 

Other church authorities are referred to as ''area authorities'' and ''local authorities'' and include all other [[Quorums of the Seventy]], [[Missions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mission Presidents]], [[Stake (Mormonism)|Stake Presidents]], [[Bishop]]s, and other [[Quorum (Mormonism)|quorum]] presidents. 

The Church has no salaried ministry; however, General Authorities who demonstrate need might receive a stipend from the Church, using income from Church-owned investments.<ref>Ludlow, Daniel H., Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents, 1948/1993, Ch. 32</ref> All area and local authorities, as well as holders of all other positions, are [[Laity|unpaid]] and continue in their normal occupations while serving in leadership positions.

The Church teaches that revelation from God continues today, but only as far as one's own stewardship is concerned. Accordingly, revelation to direct the entire Church comes to the prophet; revelation to direct a [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake]] comes to the stake president; for a [[Ward (Mormonism)|ward]], to the bishop, and so forth. Latter-day Saints also believe that individuals can receive personal revelation or divine guidance in raising their families and managing their life affairs. Because of their belief in modern revelation, Latter-day Saints give significant weight to the teachings of their church leaders. They revere the words their prophets and [[General authority|general authorities]] speak, when "moved upon by the Holy Ghost",<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|8|3|4}}. Members are encouraged to listen carefully to [[general conference (Mormonism)|general conference]] but also feel they can rely on personal revelation in order to appreciate validity of such statements. (see Joseph F. Smith, in Conference Report, April 1902, and [http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1981.htm/ensign%20november%201981.htm/conference%20time.htm Howard W. Hunter] in Conference Report, October 1981.)</ref> as modern-day scripture, and members are encouraged to ponder and pray for revelation regarding the truthfulness of such statements.

===Relief Society and women's status===   

{{main|Relief Society}}   
   
The Relief Society is the women's organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Founded in 1842 in [[Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]], and with the motto "Charity Never Faileth", the organization today includes more than 5 million women in over 165 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1--43-2-125,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=From Pioneer Group to Worldwide Society}}</ref> 

The status of women in church leadership has remained largely unchanged since the early [[1900s]]. Although they are not ordained to the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]], preaching and instruction by women is an integral part of weekly Latter-day Saint worship. Certain leadership positions are filled only by women, and in some of the Church's auxiliary organizations women may preside over men, such as in the [[Primary Association|Primary]], in welfare programs, at a [[Family History Library]], and so forth. Since the 1840s, women have officiated in certain [[ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinances]] (sacred rites) that take place inside [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1588-1,00.html |title= Women and the priesthood |accessdate=2006-11-05 |work=[http://mormon.org/ Mormon.org] |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}</ref>

===Current membership===
The Church reports a worldwide membership of 12,868,606{{Fact|date=March 2007}} (as of December 31, 2006) with 6.7 million members residing outside the United States. It is the fourth largest religious body in the United States.<ref>[http://www.electronicchurch.org ''2005 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches''], National Council of Churches.  See article by [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001481.html Information Please® Database], Pearson Education, Inc.</ref> The Church membership report includes all baptized members, and also "children of record" - unbaptized children under the age of eight. (Children are not baptized before the age of eight.)  Members living in the US and [[Canada]] constitute 47% of membership, [[Latin America]] 36%, and members in the rest of the world 17%. (See [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints/Membership history|growth history]]). A Survey by the [[City College of New York]] in [[2001]] extrapolated that there were 2,787,000 self-identified LDS adults in the [[United States]] in 2001, an increase of 1.3% over their [[1991]] survey, making the LDS Church the 10th-largest religious body in their phone survey of over 50,000 households.<ref>{{cite web | title=American Religious Identification Survey | work=cuny.edu | url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm | author=Egon Mayer, Ph.D.; Barry A.

===Finances===
[[Image:Lds church administration building.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Church Administration Building with the [[LDS Church Office Building]] tower in the background]]

The Church receives most of its funding from [[tithe]]s and ''[[fast offering]]s''. About ten percent of its funding also comes from income on its investments and real estate holdings.<ref>[http://mormoninquiry.typepad.com/mormon_inquiry/2004/10/lds_revenues_an.html Mormon Inquiry article]</ref> 

====Holdings====
The Church has holdings in real estate, as well as for-profit businesses managed through [[Deseret Management Corporation]], estimated in 1996 at more than $30 billion.<ref name=TimeMag>Biema, David Van.

Accessed 8 March 2007.</ref>

====Use of funds====
The Church uses most of its financial resources to construct and maintain buildings and other facilities. The Church also spends much of its funds on providing social welfare and relief and supporting missionary, educational, and other church-sponsored programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/page/0,15606,4032-1---14-168,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=Church Finances}}</ref>

'''Construction of facilities'''.
The Church builds additional chapels and temples as [[Ward (Mormonism)|wards and branches]] of the Church are organized. The Church built about 40 smaller temples between 1998 and 2001. {{LDS Temple status}} (See [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].)

'''Social welfare and relief'''.
The Church operates a welfare distribution system, as it encourages members to seek financial assistance from family and church first before seeking public or state-sponsored welfare.<ref>[http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1978.htm/ensign%20november%201978%20.htm/the%20stake%20presidents%20role%20in%20welfare%20services.htm The Stake President’s Role in Welfare Services - General Conference Oct 1978]</ref> AgReserves Inc., Deseret Cattle and Citrus Ranch, and Farmland Reserve, Inc. are part of its welfare distribution system. Welfare resources are distributed by local [[Bishop (Mormonism)|bishops]] but maintained by the [[Presiding Bishop]]. See ''[[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Preparedness|Preparedness]]''. It also sends massive relief aids to numerous victims of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and others. The relief effort has been recognized through many organizations and political leaders, including the United States leaders in reaction to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort by the Church.

'''Other programs'''.
The Church also spends much of its money collected through tithing on numerous missionary, educational, and other programs which the Church considers to be within its mission. Although the families of missionaries generally pay $400 a month for missions,<ref>[http://www.newsobserver.com/425/image_media/360949.html Acts of Faith: 2005] The News & Observer</ref> additional general funds of the Church support missionaries unable to pay for their own missions. Additionally, the Church provides a mission office and mission home for each of its 300 missions and pays for television advertising offering free copies of the Book of Mormon, the Bible, Church videos, etc. The Church also owns and subsidizes education at its three Universities (see [[#Education|Education]] above). It also supports [[Scouting|Boy Scout]] programs for young men. In addition, it supports its Seminary and Institute programs with tithing money.

===Programs===
====Church Educational System====
{{main|Church Educational System}}

Latter-day Saints believe in the value of education.  Joseph Smith taught that "the glory of God is intelligence."<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|93|36}}</ref> Accordingly, the Church emphasizes education maintaining [[Brigham Young University]], [[Brigham Young University-Idaho]] (formerly Ricks College), and [[Brigham Young University-Hawaii]]. The Church also has [[religious education]] programs. ''[[Seminary]]'' is a program for high school students held daily in conjunction with the school year.  The ''Institutes of Religion'' program serves young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 and those enrolled in [[post-secondary education]] institutions with church owned buildings near college campuses designated for the purpose of religious education and cultural socialization.

In addition, the Church sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the [[Perpetual Education Fund]]. This fund is designed to benefit young men and women from all parts of the world who have served a mission, returned to their home, and need further education to become productive citizens in their respective countries. As they finish their education and enter the work force, they then are able to pay back the funds provided so that other individuals can attend both [[vocational]] [[technical schools]] and university.

==== Missionary program====   
{{main|Mormon missionary}}   
{{see also|Missions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Young men between the ages of 19 and 26 who are considered worthy (follow the teachings of the Church) are encouraged to consider a two-year, full-time proselyting mission. Women (less encouraged but supported) who desire to serve a mission must be at least 21 and generally serve 18-month missions.  Elderly, retired couples are encouraged to serve missions as well, and their length of service varies from three to 36 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/missionary/mormon_missionaries.html|title=Mormon Missionaries|publisher=Light Planet}}</ref> Elderly adult women also occasionally serve a mission, of varying lengths.  

Today there are more than 330 missions and approximately 56,000 full time proselytizing missionaries serving throughout the world. In addition, about 5,100 missionaries are on special assignment missions, serving as health care specialists, doctors, craftsmen, artisans, construction supervisors, agricultural experts and educators for developing countries and educators, family history researchers and leadership trainers.<ref name="Missionary Program"/>
