[[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s '''Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64''' is his last large orchestral work. It forms an important part of the [[violin]] repertoire and is one of the most popular and most frequently performed [[violin concerto]]s of all time.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web||url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artist/zdxm|accessdate=2007-04-26|title=BBC Mendelssohn Profile}}</ref><ref>{{cite web||url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravikant/hw4/mendelssohn.html|accessdate=2007-04-28|title=''Facility & Mastery: Felix Mendelssohn''|author=Dane.

== History ==

Following his appointment in 1835 to principal [[Conductor (music)|conductor]] of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]]<ref name="cam">Mercer-Taylor, P. J. ''The Cambridge Companion to Mendelssohn'', CUP (2004)</ref>, Mendelssohn named his childhood friend [[Ferdinand David]] as the orchestra's [[concertmaster]].<ref name="mt">''Ferdinand David'', Musical Times Vol. 47, No. 761</ref> The work's origins derive from this professional collaboration. In a letter dated [[30 July]] [[1838 in music|1838]], Mendelssohn wrote to David: "I should like to write a violin concerto for you next winter. One in E minor runs through my head, the beginning of which gives me no peace."<ref name="let">Dr. Rietz, J. ''Letters of Felix Mendelssohn, 1833 – 1847'', Ayer (1970)</ref><p>

However, the concerto took another six years to complete. There are many possible reasons for the delay, including self-doubt,<ref name="cam2"/> his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mendelssohn)|third symphony]]<ref name="sb"/> and an unhappy period in Berlin after a request from King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]].<ref name="cme">Jacobson, J. H. ''The Classical Music Experience'', Sourcebooks, Inc. (2002)</ref> During this time though, Mendelssohn and David kept up a regular correspondence,<ref name="let"/> with Mendelssohn seeking technical and compositional advice. Indeed, this violin concerto was the first of many to have been composed with the input of a professional violinist, and would influence many future colloborations.<ref name="sb">Steinberg, M. ''The Concerto: A Listener's Guide'', OUP (1998)</ref>  The autographed score is dated [[16 September]] [[1844 in music|1844]], but Mendelssohn was still seeking advice from David until its premiere.<ref name="mt"/> When it was finally completed, it was first performed in [[Leipzig]] on [[13 March]] [[1845 in music|1845]] with Ferdinand David as soloist. Mendelssohn was unable to conduct due to illness and the premiere was conducted by the Danish composer [[Niels Gade]].<ref name="sb"/>

== Instrumentation ==

The work is scored for solo violin and a standard classical orchestra consisting of two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, two [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s, two [[trumpet]]s, [[timpani]], and [[string section|strings]].<ref name="dov"/><ref name="sb"/>

== Movements ==
The concerto is in three [[movement (music)|movements]]:

# Allegro molto appassionato
# Andante
# Allegretto non troppo – Allegro molto vivace

=== Allegro molto appassionato ===
'''''12 – 14 minutes'''''
[[Image:Mendelssohn_VnConcert_op64_1mvt_1theme.png|thumb|right|300px|The opening of the Violin Concerto]]

The concerto opens with an almost immediate entry of the solo violin with the very tune in [[E minor]] that gave Mendelssohn no peace.<ref name="ker"/> Following a [[bravura]] of rapidly descending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra.<ref name="sb" /> There is then a frenetic [[chromatic]] transition passage<ref name="sb"/> as the music subsides and [[Modulation (music)|modulates]] into a tranquil second subject theme in [[G major]].<ref name="cam3"/> The melody is initially played by the woodwind with the soloist providing a [[pedal point|pedal]] note on an [[Musical tuning#Basic tuning (open strings)|open G string]].<ref name="ker">Kerman, J. ''Concerto Conversations'', HUP (1999)</ref> The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]] ends the [[Sonata_form#Exposition|exposition]] section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the [[Sonata_form#Development|development]] section, where the music builds up to the [[cadenza]], which Mendelssohn wrote himself.<ref name="mt"/> The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from [[quaver]]s to [[tuplet|quaver-triplets]] and finally to [[semiquaver]]s,<ref name="cam2"/> which require ricochet bowing from the soloist.<ref name="bar">Mendelssohn, F. ''Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64'', Bärenreiter (2005)</ref> This serves as a link to the [[Sonata_form#Recapitulation|recapitulation]], where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played for the first time in a [[Major and minor|minor]] key. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto',<ref name="bar"/> before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.

=== Andante ===
'''''8 – 9 minutes'''''
[[Image:Mendelssohn_VnConcert_op64_2mvt.png|thumb|right|300px|The main theme of the Andante]]

The bassoon sustains its B from the final chord of the first movement before moving up a [[semitone]] to [[middle C]].<ref name="sb"/>  This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical [[C major]] slow movement. The movement is in [[ternary form]] and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own [[Songs without Words]].<ref name="cam2"/> The theme to the darker middle section in [[A minor]]<ref name="cam3"/> is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The [[tremolo|tremulous]] accompaniment<ref name="sb"/> requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C major theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.

=== Allegretto non troppo – Allegro molto vivace ===
'''''6 minutes'''''
[[Image:Mendelssohn_VnConcert_op64_3mvt_1theme.png|thumb|right|300px|The opening theme of the Allegro molto vivace]]

Following the second movement, there is a brief fourteen bar transitional passage in E minor for solo violin and strings only.<ref name="bar"/> This leads into the lively finale, the whole of which is in E major and whose opening is marked by a trumpet fanfare.<ref name="sb"/> The third movement is in [[sonata rondo form]]<ref name="cam3"/> with an opening theme requiring fast passage work from the soloist. The opening exposition leads into a brief second [[B major]]<ref name="cam2"/> theme which is played by the soloist and builds to a series of rapidly ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, before the music moves into a short development section in [[G major]].<ref name="cam2"/> The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a [[counter-melody]] in the strings. There is almost a small cadenza near the end of the movement when the woodwind play the main tune against prolonged trills from the solo violin <ref name="cam2"/>. The concerto then concludes with a frenetic coda.

== Analysis ==

The concerto is innovative in many respects. In the first movement alone, Mendelssohn departs from the typical form of a Classical concerto in many ways. The most immediate is the entry of the soloist almost from the outset, which happens also in his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|First Piano Concerto]].<ref name="ker"/> Although the first movement is mostly in [[sonata form]], Mendelssohn has the first theme played by the solo violin and then by the orchestra. Classical concertos typically open with an orchestral introduction followed by a version of essentially the same material that incorporates the soloist.<ref name="sb" />

The cadenza is also novel in that it is written out as part of the concerto,<ref name="cam2">Keefe, S. P. ''The Cambridge Companion to the Concerto'', CUP (2005)</ref> and located before the recapitulation.<ref name="sb" /> In a typical Classical concerto, the cadenza is improvised by the performing soloist and occurs at the end of a movement, after the recapitulation and just before the final coda.

The violin concerto stands out in its linking of the three movements.<ref name="cam2" /> There is no break between the first and second movements, with a bassoon note held between the two.<ref name="sb" /> The bridging passage between the last two movements begins almost immediately after the slow movement. The melody is similar to that of the opening, which hints at the [[cyclic form]] of the piece.<ref name="wil">Wilson, C. ''Notes on Mendelssohn: 20 Crucial Works'', Eerdmans Books (2005)</ref> The linking was designed to eliminate applause between movements. This would have come as a surprise to Mendelssohn's audience, who unlike today were used to applauding between movements.<ref name="sb" />

The concerto also calls on the soloist to be nothing more than just an accompanist to the orchestra for extended periods, an example being the ricochet arpeggios at the start of the recapitulation. This too was novel for a violin concerto of its time.<ref name="cam2" />

== Legacy ==

Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto influenced the concertos of many other composers, who would use aspects of the concerto in their own.<ref name="ker" /> This would lead to the concerto being regarded as one of the most [[plagiarism|plagiarised]] of all time.<ref name="BBC"/>

For example, the unusual placement of the cadenza would inspire the violin concertos by [[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky]] where the cadenza is also placed before the recapitulation and [[Violin Concerto (Sibelius)|Sibelius]] where the cadenza serves to extend the development section.<ref name="cam2"/> Following this concerto, it would also be very rare for a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten and left for the soloist to improvise.<ref name="ker" /> The linking of the three movements would also influence other concertos, an example being [[Franz Liszt|Liszt's]] [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Liszt)|Second Piano Concerto]].<ref name="cam2" />

The concerto itself was an instant success and by the end of the nineteenth century, the piece was considered one of the greatest violin concertos in the repertoire.<ref name="cam2" /> It would become one of Mendelssohn's most popular pieces, and was still regularly performed, even when interest in his music declined in the early twentieth century.<ref name="cam" /> In 1906, the year before his death, celebrated violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] told the guests at his 75th birthday party:<ref name="sb" />

<blockquote>"The Germans have four violin concertos. The greatest, most uncompromising is [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Beethoven's]]. The [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|one by Brahms]] vies with it in seriousness.  The richest, the most seductive, was written by [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Bruch)|Max Bruch]]. But the most inward, the heart's jewel, is Mendelssohn's."</blockquote>

Joachim, who was nominally a pupil of Ferdinand David and Mendelssohn's protégé<ref name="cam3">Stowell R. ''The Cambridge Companion to the Violin'', CUP (1992)</ref> gave one of the first performances of the concerto at the age of only 12.<ref name="sb"/> Also [[Max Bruch|Bruch]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] both dedicated their violin concertos to Joachim,<ref name="sb"/> with Brahms even allowing Joachim to write his own cadenza which was no longer the norm at the time.<ref name="ker"/>

The work has developed a reputation as an essential work for all aspiring violin virtuosi to conquer. Even so, the concerto is still technically challenging and is generally considered to be as difficult as many other famous counterparts.<ref name="vm">{{cite web||url=http://violinmasterclass.com/repertoire.php?type=orch#8|title=Violin Masterclass' Graded Repertoire|accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref> 

Mendelssohn also wrote a [[Concerto for Violin and Strings (Mendelssohn)|violin concerto with strings]] in 1822, which was given its [[20th century]] premiere in 1952 by [[Yehudi Menuhin]].
