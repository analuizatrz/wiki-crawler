'''Procellariiformes''' is an order of [[seabird]]s that is comprised of four [[family (biology)|families]], the [[albatross]]es, [[Procellariidae|procellariids]], [[storm-petrel]]s and [[diving petrel]]s. Formerly called '''Tubinares''' and still called '''tubenoses''' in English, they are often referred to collectively as the '''[[petrel]]s''', a term that chas been applied to all Procellariiformes<ref name ="war">Warham, J. (1996). ''The Behaviour, Population, Biology and Physiology of the Petrels''. London:Academic Press, ISBN 0-12-735415-8</ref> or more commonly all the families except the albatrosses.<ref name = "Brooke">Brooke, M. (2004). ''Albatrosses And Petrels Across The World'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK ISBN 0-19-850125-0</ref> They are almost exclusively [[pelagic]] (feeding in the open ocean). They have a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] across the world's oceans, with the highest diversity being around [[New Zealand]]. 

Procellariiformes have had a long relationship with humans. They have been important food sources for many people, and continue to be hunted as such in some parts of the world. They have also been the subject of numerous cultural depictions, particularly albatrosses. Procellariiformes are one of the most endangered bird taxa, with many species threatened with [[extinction]] due to [[introduced species|introduced predators]] in their breeding colonies, marine [[pollution]] and the danger of fisheries by-catch. Scientists, conservationists, fishermen and governments around the world are working to reduce the threats posed to them, and these efforts have led to the signing of the [[Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels]], a legally binding international treaty signed in 2001.   
==Biology==
===Morphology and flight===
[[Image:070226 southern royal albatross off Kaikoura 2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Southern Royal Albatross]] is the largest of the Procellariiformes]]
All Procellariiformes range in size from very large [[Southern Royal Albatross]] (10k) to tiny [[Least Storm-petrel]] (20 g). They have their nostrils enclosed in one or two tubes on their straight, deeply grooved bills with hooked tips. The beaks are made up from several plates. Wings are long and narrow; feet are webbed, and the hind toe is undeveloped or non-existent. Plumage is predominantly black, white and grey.

The order has a characteristic tubular nasal passage which is used for [[olfaction]].<ref>Lequette, B., Verheyden, C., Jowentin, P. (1989) "Olfaction in Subantarctic seabirds: Its phylogenetic and ecological significance" ''The Condor'' '''91''': 732-135. [http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&q=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v091n03/p0732-p0735.pdf]</ref> This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate [[seabird colony|nesting colonies]].

The longer-winged species fly using a switchback technique to minimise active flapping. All eat fish, [[squid]] or similar marine prey.

Most are unable to walk well on land, and many species visit their remote breeding islands only at night. The exceptions are the huge albatrosses, several of the gadfly petrels and shearwaters and the fulmar-petrels. The latter can disable even large predatory birds with their obnoxious [[stomach oil]], which they can project some distance. This stomach oil is a digestive residue created in the foregut of all tubenoses except the diving petrels, and is used mainly for storage of energy rich food as well as for defence.

===Breeding behaviour===
All Procellariiformes are [[seabird colony|colonial]], predominantly breeding on offshore or oceanic islands. The few species that nest on continents do so in inhospitable environments such as dry deserts or on Antarctica. These colonies can vary from the widely spaced colonies of the [[giant petrel]]s to the dense 3.6 million strong colonies of [[Leach's Storm Petrel]]s.<ref>West, J. & Nilsson, R. (1994) "Habitat use and burrow densities of burrow-nesting seabirds on South East Island, Chatham Islands, New Zealand" ''Notornis (Supplement)'' '''41''' 27-37 [http://www.notornis.org.nz/free_issues/Notornis_41-1994/Notornis_41_sup_27.pdf#search=%22storm-petrel%22]</ref> For almost all species the need to breed is the only reason that Procellariiformes return to land at all. Within the colonies pairs defend usually small [[Territory (animal)|territories]] (the giant petrels and some albatrosses can have very large territories) which is either the small area around the nest or a burrow. Competition between pairs can be intense, as can competition between species, particularly for burrows. Larger species of petrels will even kill the chicks and even adults of smaller species in disputes over burrows.<ref>Medeiros R., Hothersall B. and Campos A. (2003) "The use of artificial breeding chambers as a conservation measure for cavity-nesting procellariiform seabirds: a case study of the Madeiran storm petrel (''Oceanodroma castro'')"  ''Biological Conservation '' '''116'''(1): 73-80 <small>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3207(03)00178-2</small></ref> Burrows and natural crevices are most commonly used by the smaller species; all the [[storm-petrel]]s and [[diving-petrel]]s are cavity nesters, as are many of the [[procellariid]]s.  The [[fulmarine petrel]]s and some tropical [[gadfly petrel]]s and [[shearwater]]s are surface nesters, as are all the albatrosses.

Procellariiformes show high levels of [[philopatry]], both site fidelity and natal philopatry. Natal philopatry is the tendency of an individual bird to return to its natal colony to breed, often many years after leaving the colony as a chick. This tendency has been shown through [[bird ringing|ringing studies]] and [[mitochondrial DNA]] studies.  In the ringing studies birds ringed as chicks are recapatured close to their original nests, a tendency which can be extreme at times; in [[Laysan Albatross]] the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22 metres,<ref>Fisher, H.I., (1976) "Some dynamics of a breeding colony of Laysan Albatrosses. ''Wilson Bulletin'' '''88''': 121–142.</ref> and a study of [[Cory's Shearwater]]s nesting near [[Corsica]] found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in.<ref>Rabouam, C., Thibault, J.-C., Bretagnolle, V., (1998) "Natal Philopatry and Close Inbreeding in Cory's Shearwater (''Calonectris diomedea'')" ''Auk'' '''115'''(2): 483–486 [http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v115n02/p0483-p0486.pdf]</ref>

==Species==<!-- Parascaniornis was formerly assigned here by some, but is syn. of Baptornis -->
There are a total of around 125 species of Procellariiformes world-wide,<ref name = "Brooke"/> divided among four families:

* Order Procellariiformes
** Family [[Procellariidae]] ([[shearwater]]s, [[fulmarine petrel]]s, [[gadfly petrel]]s, and [[prion (bird)|prion]]s)
** Family [[Diomedeidae]] ([[albatross]]es)
** Family [[Hydrobatidae]] ([[storm-petrel]]s)
** Family [[Pelecanoididae]] ([[diving-petrel]]s)

The Hydrobatidae's two subfamilies, Oceanitinadae and Hydrobatinae, are probably better treated as distinct families.<ref>Nunn, G & Stanley, S. (1998): Body Size Effects and Rates of Cytochrome ''b'' Evolution in Tube-Nosed Seabirds. ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'' '''15'''(10): 1360-1371 [http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/15/10/1360.pdf PDF fulltext] [http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/17/11/1774.pdf Corrigendum]</ref>

Procellariiformes are most closely related to [[Sphenisciformes]] (Penguins).

In the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]], the tubenoses are included in a greatly enlarged order ''Ciconiiformes''. This [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] treatment is almost certainly erroneous, but the assumption of a close evolutionary relationship may be correct{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

At one point (until the beginning of the 20th century), the family ''Hydrobatidae'' was named ''Procellariidae'', and the family now called ''Procellariidae'' was rendered ''"Puffinidae." '' The order itself was called ''Tubinares''.  A major early work on this group is F. DuCane Godman's ''Monograph of the Petrels'', five fascicles, 1907--1910., with portraits of figures by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]].
