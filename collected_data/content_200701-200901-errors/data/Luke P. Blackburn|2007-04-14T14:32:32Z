'''Luke Pryor Blackburn''' ([[July 16]], [[1816]] - [[September 14]], [[1887]]) was [[Governor of Kentucky]] from [[1879]] to [[1883]]. 

Born in [[1816]] in [[Woodford County, Kentucky]], he worked for [[prison reform]], including a state-operated warden system and [[parole]]. He died in [[1887]] in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], and is buried at Frankfort Cemetery in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]].

==Civil War==
Blackburn was a prominent [[yellow fever]] specialist in the South prior to the Civil War. When the war began, his desire to serve the [[Confederate States Army]] led him to [[Bermuda]], where he worked with yellow fever patients. In one plot, he collected infected blankets and clothing together with [[Alexander Keith, Jr.]], with the intention of delivering them to Northern cities and creating a yellow fever [[pandemic]]{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. He also planned to deliver shirts exposed to the fever to Abraham Lincoln. He was known as "Dr. Black Vomit," among other nicknames, and is considered to be one of the first bioterrorists in the United States.

However it was many years later, in 1900, when yellow fever was discovered, by Major [[Walter Reed]] M.D., to be spread only through biting of mosquitoes, not through contaminated objects as Blackburn had thought.  So in the end he was not the one was responsible for the breakout, he just got lucky.
