'''Dachau''' is the name of a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]], constructed in a disused [[gunpowder]] factory and completed on [[March 21]], [[1933]]. Although Dachau was not the first Nazi prisoner camp, it was the first concentration-style camp after which all subsequent concentration camps were modelled.  Together with the much larger [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], Dachau has come to symbolize the Nazi concentration camps to many people. The camp lies near the medieval town of [[Dachau]], outside [[Munich]].

==1933-1945==

Dachau was the first regular Nazi concentration camp and served as a prototype and model for the others that followed. Its basic organization, camp layout as well as the plan for the buildings were developed by [[Commandant|Kommandant]] [[Theodor Eicke]] and were applied to all later camps. He had a separate secure camp near the command center, which consisted of living quarters, administration, and army camps. Eicke himself became the chief inspector for all concentration camps, responsible for molding the others according to his model.

In total, over 200,000 prisoners from more than 30 countries were housed in Dachau. At least 30,000 prisoners are believed to have died in the camp and its subcamps, to which must be added an unknown number of unregistered persons. In early [[1945]], there was a [[typhus]] epidemic in the camp followed by an evacuation, in which large numbers of the weaker prisoners died.

Among the most famous inmates of the Dachau concentration camp were [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Litten Hans Litten], Fred Rabinowitz (aka Fred Roberts), [[Stefan Starzynski]], the composer [[Blaž Arnič]] and Alfred Gruenebaum, the father of a prominent [[US]] [[obstetrician]], [[Amos Grunebaum]].

Dachau also served as the central camp for [[Christian]] religious prisoners. According to records of the [[Roman Catholic]] Church, at least 3000 [[religious]], [[deacon]]s, [[priest]]s, and [[bishop]]s were imprisoned there. Particularly notable among the Christian residents are [[Karl Leisner]] (Catholic priest ordained while in the camp, [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[1996]]) and [[Martin Niemöller]] ([[Protestant]] theologian and Nazi resistance leader).

In August [[1944]] a women's camp opened inside Dachau.  Its first shipment of women came from Auschwitz Birkenau.  Only nineteen [[Female Guards in Nazi Concentration Camps|women guards]] served at Dachau, most of them until liberation, and only sixty-three served in the Dachau complex.  Sources show the names of sixteen of the nineteen women guarding the camp; [[Fanny Baur]], Leopoldine Bittermann, [[Ernestine Brenner]], [[Anna Buck]], [[Rosa Dolaschko]], [[Maria Eder]], [[Rosa Grassmann]], [[Betty Hanneschaleger]], [[Ruth Elfriede Hildner]], [[Josefa Keller]], [[Berta Kimplinger]], [[Lieselotte Klaudat]], Theresia Kopp, [[Rosalie Leimboeck]], and [[Thea Miesl]]. Women guards were also staffed at the Augsburg Michelwerke, Burgau, Kaufering, Muhldorf, and Munich Agfa Camera Werke subcamps.  In mid-April 1945 many female subcamps at [[Kaufering]], [[Augsburg]] and [[Munich]] closed, and the SS women stationed at Dachau.  It is reported that female SS guards gave prisoners guns before liberation to save them from postwar prosecution. {{fact}}

In the last war months the conditions were catastrophic in the camp. Due to continual new transportations from the front the camp was constantly overcrowded, the hygenic conditions were beneath human dignity. Starting from the end of 1944 up to the day of liberation 15000 people died, about half of all victims in KZ Dachau. On 27 April Victor Mauer, delegates of the International Committee of the [[Red Cross]], was allowed to enter camps and distribute food. In the evening of the same day a prisoner transport arrived from [[Buchenwald]]. Only 800 survivors were brought from originally 4,480 to 4,800 persons in transit. Over 2,300 corpses were let lie in and around the train. The last regular commander of the KZ, [[Obersturmbannführer]] Eduard Weiter, had already set off on 26 April. He probably followed Obersturmbannführer Martin Weiss, which had led the camp from September 1942 until November 1943. 23-year-old [[Untersturmführer]] Heinrich Wicker too mover, and fled on 28 or 29 April. Already on 28 April SS-Standartenführer Kurt Becher had probably discussed with Weiss the delivery of the camp to the Americans.

On 29 April also the last part of the SS garrison wanted to set off with Heinrich Wicker, but was persuaded Victor Mauer to remain. Mauer feared that the prisoners would escape en masse and sperad the typhoid fever epidemic which was spreading among them. The watchtowers of the camp remained occupied; a white flag was hoisted.

The area in Dachau included other SS facilities beside the concentration camp - a leader school of the economic and civil service, the medical school of the SS, etct. The KZ, at that time called "protective custody camp", occupied less than half of the area of the entire complex.

==Liberation of the camp, 1945==
[[Image:Dachau-002edit.jpg|thumb|right|Tablet dedicated to the 42nd Division.]]The camp was freed by the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] of the [[U.S. Seventh Army]] on [[April 29]], [[1945]] after coming across this camp, not knowing its location nor its existence. These forces were led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Felix L. Sparks]] who, under orders to permit no one in or out, refused entry to a [[brigadier general]] from another unit. Court-martial charges were drawn up, and Sparks was arrested; the charges were dismissed by [[George S. Patton|General Patton]].

It holds a significant place in public memory because it was the second camp to be liberated by [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[United States|American]] forces, and therefore it was one of the first places in which the [[Western world|West]] was exposed to the reality of [[Nazism|Nazi]] brutality through firsthand [[journalist]] accounts and through [[newsreel]]s. After the camp was surrendered to [[Allied forces]], the troops were so horrified by conditions at the camp that they summarily shot many of the camp guards, in what is called the [[Dachau massacre]]. The exact number killed is in dispute; according to some versions, only 35 Nazi guards were executed this way and the other 515 were presumably either arrested, or managed to escape. The Americans found 32,000 prisoners, crammed 1,600 to each of 20 barracks, which had been designed to house 250 people each. The US troops also found 39 railroad cars, each filled with one hundred or more corpses.

According to an investigation report, the slogan "we will take no prisoners here!" went round the USA soldiers. At the end of the railway 4 SS men came to meet the Americans, and surrendered. They were led to the train and shot down by the company commander. Since they were not immediately dead, others fired on the wounded men.

A few days after the liberation of the camp was the day of [[Pascha]], Orthodox Easter. In a cell block used by Catholic priests to say daily mass, several [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Serbia]]n, and [[Russia]]n priests and one Serbian deacon, wearing makeshift vestments made from towels of the SS guard, gathered with several hundred Greek, Serbian and Russian prisoners to celebrate the Paschal Matins and Liturgy. A prisoner named Rahr described the scene: "In the entire history of the [[Orthodox Church]] there has probably never been an Easter service like the one at Dachau in 1945. Greek and Serbian priests together with a Serbian deacon adorned the make-shift 'vestments' over their blue and gray-striped prisoners uniforms. Then they began to chant, changing from Greek to Slavonic, and then back again to Greek. The Easter Canon, the Easter Sticheras - everything was recited from memory. The Gospel - 'In the beginning was the Word' - also from memory. And finally, the Homily of Saint John - also from memory. A young Greek [[monk]] from the Holy Mountain stood up in front of us and recited it with such infectious enthusiasm that we shall never forget him as long as we live. Saint John Chrysostomos himself seemed to speak through him to us and to the rest of the world as well!" There is a Russian Orthodox chapel at the camp today, and it is well know for its exquisite icon of Christ leading the prisoners out of the camp gates.

The U.S. 7th Army's version of the events of the Dachau Liberation are available in Report of Operations of the Seventh United States Army, Vol. 3. page 382.

The U.S. troops also forced citizens of the local community to come to the camp, observe the conditions, and help clean the facilities.  The local residents were indignant at being treated this way and claimed no knowledge of the activities of the camp.

==After liberation==
After liberation, the camp was used by the [[United States Army|US Army]] as an [[internment]] camp. In 1948 the [[Bavaria]]n government established housing for [[refugee]]s on the site, and this remained for many years.<ref>[http://www.gedenkstaettenpaedagogik-bayern.de/ausstellungstexte.htm Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site (pedagogical information)] {{De icon}}</ref>

==The memorial site==
[[Image:Dachau-015.jpg|thumb|right|The commemorative mass grave dedicated to the unknown dead at Dachau]] [[Image:Dachau_never_again.jpg|thumb|left|"Never Again"]] Years later, former prisoners banded together to erect a [[memorial]] on the site of the camp, finding it unbelievable that there were still persons (refugees) living in the camp under those conditions.

The display, which was reworked in [[2003]], takes the visitor through the path of new arrivals to the camp. Special presentations of some of the notable prisoners are also  provided. One of the [[barracks]] has been rebuilt to show a cross-section of the entire history of the camp, since the original barracks had to be torn down due to their poor condition when the memorial was built. The other 32 barracks are indicated by concrete foundations.

The memorial includes four chapels for the various religions represented among the prisoners.

The local government resisted designating the complete site a memorial.  The former SS guard barracks are now home for the Munich police special task force.
