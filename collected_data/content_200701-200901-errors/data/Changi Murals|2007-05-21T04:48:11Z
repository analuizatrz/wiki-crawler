The '''Changi Murals''' are five remarkable murals of biblical scenes painted by [[Stanley Warren]] when he was a prison of war ([[POW]]) interned at [[Changi Prison]] during the Japanese Occupation in [[Singapore]]. His murals were completed under difficult conditions of sickness, limited materials and hardships which has since become a lasting reminder to the futility of war and the hope of universal brotherhood.<ref>{{cite book | last = National Heritage Board | title = Singapore 100 Historic Places | publisher = Singapore: Archipelago Press | date = 2002 | pages =103-104 | isbn = 981-4068-23-3}} </ref>

== History ==
[[Image:Stanley_Warren_1982.jpg|150px|thumb|Stanley Warren in Singapore, circa 1982.]]
Stanley Warren (b.1917 - d.1992) was born in [[England]] in 1917. He was a religious man and was talented in art. Stanley was employed as a commercial designer producing poster ads with the Grenada organisation before the war. In January 1940, he enlisted in the army to join the fight against [[Nazi]] [[Germany]] and was posted to the [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]] as an Observation Post (OP) Assistant. His responsibilites included having to make quick drawings of panoramas used to plot targets for the guns.<ref>{{cite book | last = Stubbs | first = Peter W.| title = The Changi Murals - The Story of Stanley Warren's War | publisher = Singapore: Landmarks Books | date = 2003 | pages =pp. 49-101 | isbn = 981-3065-84-2}} </ref>

=== Malaya ===
Later, he was posted overseas to [[Malaya]] with the 15th Regiment Royal Artillery after the Japanese had invaded Malaya and [[Thailand]], and [[Pearl Harbour]] had been bombed, bringing America to the war. Upon their arrival, their fight against the Japanese was brutal and short-lived and soon his battalion began retreating to Singapore.    
 
After the British surrender of Singapore on 15th February 1942, Stanley and [[Allied]] POWs were ordered to march to Changi camp for internment and later work around Singapore  repairing damage inflicted by the Japanese attacks and getting essential services back to working order. 

=== Bukit Batok Hill ===
During one of the work parties, Stanley was sent to build a road and stairs leading to a memorial to the Japanese dead on Bukit Batok Hill.(Marked with a [[Bukit Batok Memorial]] plaque today only the stairs and road called Lorong Sesuai are still there to be seen. The memorial had been destroyed and the ashes of the Japanese war dead were subsequently relocated to the [[Japanese Cemetery Park]] at Chuan Hoe Avenue).<ref>{{cite book | last = Maj.

The chaplain of the regiment, on learning of Stanley artistic talent, asked him to decorate the asbestos walls at the altar area of a small open attap-roofed chapel at Bukit Batok. With charcoal salvaged from around the camp, he drew two murals: 'Nativity', which featured a [[Malay]] [[Madonna]] and 'Descent from the Cross" in which he included soldiers in uniforms, using his comrades as models.

By then, he was becoming ill and was suffering from a severe renal disorder complicated by [[amoebic dysentery]]. On 23 May 1942, Stanley was lying comatose and was sent to Roberts Barracks in [[Changi]] which was converted for use as a hospital for POWs to recuperate.

=== St Luke's Chapel ===
By middle of August, Stanley had recovered enough to be moved to the dysentery wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks. Padres Chambers and Payne had heard that Stanley had decorated the prisoners' chapel at Bukit Batok. So they asked him if he would do some paintings for St Luke’s Chapel which was recently converted from the ground floor of Block 151 near the area where Stanley was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to [[St Luke]] the Physician, an appropriate choice given the use Roberts Barracks was being put to. Stanley agreed and sought inspiration for the proposed paintings in the [[Gospels]].

=== The Murals ===
On 30 August 1942, at the time when Stanley was preparing the draft drawings of the murals, the Japanese began an action which would became infamous as the [[Selarang Barracks Incident]]. Against this backdrop, Stanley began to paint the murals. No one had asked the Japanese for permission to draw and at no stage did they interfere with his work. Considering the purpose of the murals, Stanley felt that the Chapel was basically dedicated to peace and reconciliation and so he choose universal themes for the murals which would embrace all mankind.  

Paint was not readily available in the camp, but with the aid of the other prisoners, who unquestionably put themselves at great risk, materials to make the paint were gradually acquired. Brown camouflage paint, a small amount of crimson paint, white oil paint and billiard chalk were found and brought for Stanley use.

Despite still being very ill, Stanley set to work on the murals in early September 1942. His illness meant that he could only paint for a limited period each day for perhaps 15 minutes at a time followed by a rest. To compensate as much as he could for the lack of coloured paint, Stanley resorted to using large brush strokes and big areas of solid colour when painting. By Christmas 1942, he completed his first mural, the 'Nativity'. Altogether, Stanley managed to produce five large murals<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/world_war2/v04n12_history.html | title = 1942 - The Changi Murals | accessdate = 2007-05-17 | publisher = MINDEF Singapore}}</ref> on the walls of the Chapel in the following order:

#[[Nativity]]
#[[Ascension]]
#[[Crucifixion]] 
#[[Last Supper]]
#St Luke in Prison

All of them are subjects which are at the very heart of [[Christian]] belief. The completed murals uplifted the spirits of the POWs and sick when they seek refuge in the Chapel. 

=== Damaged and forgotten ===
In May 1944, Block 151 with the St Luke Chapel's inspiring murals was designated to become a store for an airfield nearby. The lower potion of St Luke in Prison mural was almost completely destroyed when it was demolished to make a link to the adjoining room. The walls of the Chapel was distempered over, hidden the murals from view.    

Stanley was later sent to [[Kranji]] in the north of Singapore, not far from the [[johor-Singapore Causeway|causeway]] to Malaya and remained there till the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945. After the war, Stanley returned to England believing that his murals had been destroyed by Allied bombing towards the end of the war. He married and became an art teacher at the Sir William Collins School now [[South Camden Community School]] in [[London]].

=== The rediscovery ===
Forgotten for nearly 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by servicemen of the British Royal Air Force occupying the Roberts Barracks. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed - four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature on any of the murals, a search for the arttist started but failed to unearth after initial investigations.

By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came to light in the [[RAF]] Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled 'The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya' mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name - Bombardier Stanley Warren. The '[[Daily Mirror]]' was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he see the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers. 
  
In 1960, the RAF contacted Stanley and the idea of restoring the murals was brought up. He was initially reluctant to return to restore his works due to the painful memories of war and captivity the murals would bring back to him. Fortunately, he overcame his fear eventually after much persuasion and made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by the officers and boys of the [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]] Boys' School enabled the bulk of the work to be completed.

Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley’s original tracing of the drawing was missing and he could not remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley’s original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the mural in 1988. He was by then not fit enough to restore the actual mural.

On 20 February 1992, Stanley passed away in his home in [[Dorset]], England.

Block 151 of Roberts Barracks (off Martlesham Road) still stands today but is now part of the Ministry of Defence's Changi Military Camp. Access to the Chapel is restricted.  

However, for public interest, a replica of Stanley Warren's murals is also on display at the Changi Chapel and Museum,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.changimuseum.com/Exhibition1/Zone3_bodytext.htm | title = Picture Gallery - The Changi Murals | accessdate = 2007-05-17 | publisher = Changi Chapel & Museum}}</ref> along with an audio-visual theatre that screens videos about POW life, display of POW belongings and collection of books about Singapore during WWII.

Whether one is viewing the actual murals or its replica, both represent Stanley Warren's legacy to humanity of man's indomitable spirit in the face of adversity and the power of faith.
