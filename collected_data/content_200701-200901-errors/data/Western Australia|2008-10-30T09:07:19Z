'''Western Australia''' is a [[States and territories of Australia|state]] occupying the entire western third of the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]]. The nation's largest state and the second largest [[subnational entity]] in the world, it has 2.1 million inhabitants (10% of the national total), 85% of whom live in the south-west corner of the state. The people of Western Australia are often colloquially referred to as ''[[Sandgroper (insect)|sandgroper]]s'', the common name of an insect found on sand dunes around [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].<ref>[http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/collections/natscience/invertebrates/sandgropers.asp Western Australian Museum - Sandgroper]</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Western Australia}}
Western Australia is bounded by [[South Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]] to the east, and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the west and north. In Australia, the [[Australia and the Southern Ocean|body of water south of the continent]] is officially gazetted as the [[Southern Ocean]], whereas the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) designates it as part of the Indian Ocean.<ref name="SouthernOcean"> [http://www.iho.shom.fr/publicat/free/files/S23_1953.pdf IHO Limit of Oceans and Seas] and [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/21/1071941610556.html Article]</ref> The total distance of the state's eastern borders is 1,862 km,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/dimensions/borders.htm|title=State And Territory Borders|publisher=Geoscience Australia|date=11 September 2007|accessdate=2008-09-25|}}</ref> and there is 12,889km of coastline.<ref>{{cite web

==Natural history==
===Geology===
The bulk of Western Australia consists of the extremely old [[Yilgarn craton]] and [[Pilbara craton]] which merged with the [[Deccan]] of [[India]], [[Madagascar]] and the [[Karoo]] and [[Zimbabwe]] cratons of [[Southern Africa]], in the [[Archean]] Eon to form [[Ur (continent)|Ur]], one of the oldest [[Supercontinent]]s on Earth (3,200-3,000 million years ago). Because the only [[orogeny|mountain-building]] since then has been of the [[Stirling Range]] with the rifting from [[Antarctica]], the land is extremely eroded and ancient, with no part of the state above 1,245 metres (4,085&nbsp;ft) [[Australian Height Datum|AHD]] (at [[Mount Meharry]] in the [[Hamersley Range]] of the [[Pilbara]] region). Most parts of the state form a low [[plateau]] with an average elevation of about 400 metres (1,200&nbsp;ft), very low relief, and no surface runoff. This descends relatively sharply to the coastal plains, in some cases forming a sharp escarpment (as with the Darling Range/[[Darling Scarp]] near Perth).

The extreme age of the landscape has meant that the [[soil]]s are remarkably infertile and frequently [[laterite|laterised]]. Even soils derived from [[granite|granitic]] [[bedrock]] contain an order of magnitude less available [[phosphorus]] and only half as much [[nitrogen]] as soils in comparable climates in other [[continent]]s. Soils derived from extensive [[sand]]plains or [[ironstone]] are even less fertile, being even more devoid of soluble phosphate and also deficient in [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[molybdenum]] and sometimes [[potassium]] and [[calcium]].

[[Image:WAHighways.png|thumb|left|240px|Western Australian cities, towns, settlements and 

[[List of highways in Western Australia|road network]]]]
The infertility of most of the soils has required heavy inputs of chemical fertilisers, particularly [[superphosphate]], [[insecticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s, which&mdash;with the ensuing damage to [[invertebrate]] and [[bacteria]]l populations, and [[soil compaction|compaction of soils]] through heavy machinery and hoofed mammals&mdash;has done great damage to the fragile soils. Large-scale land clearing for agriculture and forestry has damaged habitats for native flora and fauna. As a result, the [[Southwest Australia|South West region]] of the state has a higher concentration of rare, threatened or endangered flora and fauna than many areas of Australia, making it one of the world's biodiversity "hot spots". Large areas of the state's wheatbelt region have problems with [[salinity|dryland salinity]] and the loss of fresh water.

===Climate===
The [[Southwest corner of Western Australia|southwest coastal area]] is relatively [[temperate]] and was originally heavily forested, including large stands of the [[karri]], one of the tallest trees in the world. This agricultural region of Western Australia is in the top nine terrestrial habitats for terrestrial [[biodiversity]], with a higher proportion of [[endemic species]] than most other equivalent regions. Thanks to the offshore [[Leeuwin Current]] the area numbers in the top six regions for marine biodiversity, containing the most southerly [[coral reef]]s in the world. 
[[Image:HayStreetPerth01 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hay Street, Perth]]

Average annual rainfall varies from 300 millimetres (12&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]) at the edge of the [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] region to 1,400 millimetres (55&nbsp;in) in the wettest areas near Northcliffe, but in the months of November to March evaporation exceeds rainfall, and it is generally very dry. Plants must be adapted to this as well as the extreme poverty of all soils. A major reduction in rainfall has been observed, with a greater number of rainfall events in the summer months.

The central four-fifths of the state is [[semi-arid]] or [[desert]] and is lightly inhabited with the only significant activity being [[mining]]. Annual rainfall averages about 200 to 250 millimetres (8&ndash;10&nbsp;in), most of which occurs in sporadic torrential falls related to [[tropical cyclone|cyclone]] events in summer months.

An exception to this is the northern [[tropical]] regions. The [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] has an extremely hot [[monsoon]]al climate with average annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 1,500 millimetres (20&ndash;60&nbsp;in), but there is a very long almost rainless season from April to November. Eighty-five percent of the state's [[runoff (water)|runoff]] occurs in the Kimberley, but because it occurs in violent [[flood]]s and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils, the only development has taken place along the [[Ord River]].

Occurrence of snow in the state is rare, and typically only in the [[Stirling Range]] near [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], as it is the only mountain range far enough south and with sufficient elevation. More rarely, snow can fall on the nearby [[Porongurup National Park|Porongurup Range]]. Snow outside these areas is a major event; it usually occurs in hilly areas of southwestern Australia. The most widespread low-level snow occurred on [[26 June]] [[1956]] when snow was reported in the [[Perth Hills]], as far north as [[Wongan Hills, Western Australia|Wongan Hills]] and as far east as [[Salmon Gums, Western Australia|Salmon Gums]]. However, even in the Stirling Range, snowfalls rarely exceed 5 cm (2 in) and rarely settle for more than one day.<ref>[http://www.feargod.net/wa-snow1.php Snow in Western Australia: About Snow in WA], retrieved [[4 February]] [[2007]]</ref>

The highest observed maximum temperature of 50.5&nbsp;°C (122.9&nbsp;°F) was recorded at [[Mardie, Western Australia|Mardie]], [[Pilbara]], 61.6&nbsp;kilometres (38.3&nbsp;mi) from [[Barrow Island, Western Australia|Barrow Island]] on [[19 February]] [[1998]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp1.htm|title=Marble Bar heatwave, 1923-24|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]|accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref> The lowest minimum temperature recorded was -7.2&nbsp;°C (19.0&nbsp;°F) at [[Eyre Bird Observatory]], 49&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) south of [[Cocklebiddy, Western Australia|Cocklebiddy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/media_releases/wa/20080818.shtml|title=Media Release: Eyre sets new record low temperature for WA|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]|date=18 August, 2008|accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref>

Western Australia is home to around [[List of Western Australian birds|540 species of birds]] (depending on the taxonomy used). Of these around 15 are [[endemic species|endemic]] to the state. The best areas for birds are the southwestern corner of the state and the area around Broome and the Kimberley.

The [[Flora of Western Australia]] comprises 9437 published native [[vascular plant]] [[species]] of 1543 [[genus|genera]] within 226 [[Family (biology)|families]], there are also 1171 naturalised alien or invasive plant species more commonly known as [[weeds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://florabase.calm.wa.gov.au/statistics/|title=Current Statistics - Vascular Flora|work=Western Australian Flora Statistics|publisher=Flora Base|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref> In the southwest region are some of the largest numbers of plant species for its area in the world.

[[William Henry Harvey]] published a five-volume ''Phycologia Australia'' which was issued in parts between 1858 and 1863. He earned the title of ''father of Australian Phycology''. His main collection is in the [[herbarium]] of [[Trinity College Dublin]], there is also a large collection of his [[specimens]] in the [[Ulster Museum]], Belfast.

==History==
{{Main|History of Western Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}
[[Image:John Forrest 1898.jpg|thumbnail|170px|[[John Forrest]] was the first Premier of Western Australia]]

The first inhabitants of Australia arrived from the north approximately 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. Over thousands of years they eventually spread across the whole landmass. These [[Indigenous Australians]] were well established throughout Western Australia by the time of European explorers began to arrive in the early seventeenth century.

The first European to visit Western Australia was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] explorer, [[Dirk Hartog]] who on [[26 October]] [[1616]] landed at (what is now known as) Cape Inscription, Dirk Hartog Island. For the rest of the 17th century there were many other Dutch travellers who also, usually unintentionally, encountered the coast. By the late 18th century, [[Great Britain|British]] and [[France|French]] sailors had also begun to explore the Western Australian coast.

The origins of the present state began with the establishment of a British settlement at [[King George Sound]] in 1826 (later named [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] from 1832). The settlement was founded in response to British concerns about the possibility of a French colony being established on the coast of Western Australia.
[[Image:WAflag.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Western Australian flag at the State War Memorial, Kings Park]]

In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] was established on the Swan River by Captain [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]]. By 1832, the British settler population of the colony had reached around 1,500. The two separate townsites of the colony developed slowly into the port city of [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and the state's capital, Perth. 

Population growth was very slow until significant discoveries of [[gold]] were made in the 1890s around [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]].

In 1887, a new constitution was drafted, providing for the right of self-governance and in 1890, the act granting [[self-governing colony|self-government]] to the colony was passed by the [[British House of Commons]]. [[John Forrest]] became the first [[Premier of Western Australia]].

In 1896, the [[Western Australian Parliament]] authorised the raising of a loan to construct a pipeline to transport five million gallons of water per day to the goldfields of Western Australia. The pipeline, known as the [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme]], was completed in 1903. [[C.Y. O'Connor]], Western Australia’s first engineer-in-chief, designed and oversaw the construction of the pipeline. It carries water 530 km (330 miles) from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to [[Kalgoorlie]], and is attributed by historians as an important factor driving the state's population and economic growth.<ref >{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110059b.htm |title=''O'Connor, Charles Yelverton (1843-1902)''  |author=Tauman, Merab Harris |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 1 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1988 |pages=pp 51–54 |accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref>

Following a campaign led by Forrest, residents of the Swan River Colony voted in favour of [[Federation of Australia|federation]], resulting in Western Australia officially becoming a state on [[1 January]] [[1901]].

==Demographics==
[[Image:Swan River,Perth,Western Australia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Western Australia's capital city, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], on the Swan River. Its metropolitan area is home to 75% of the state's population]]

The first inhabitants of what is now Western Australia were [[Indigenous Australians]], from a wide variety of language and kin groups &mdash; for example, the [[Nyungah]] in the southwest, the [[Wongai]] in the central desert, the [[Malkana]] in [[Shark Bay]]. These groups continue to form the majority of the local population in the remotest parts of the state such as the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]].
 
[[Europe]]ans began to settle permanently in 1826 when [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] was claimed by Britain in order to forestall French claims to the western third of the continent. Perth was founded as the [[Swan River Colony]] in 1829 by [[British people|British]] and [[Irish Australian|Irish]] settlers, though the outpost languished, eventually requesting [[Convictism in Australia|convict]] labour to augment its population. In the 1890s, interstate migration resulting from a mining boom in the [[Goldfields-Esperance|Goldfields region]] resulted in a sharp population increase.
[[Image:WApopulation1829-2008.png|280px|left|WA Population Growth 1829-2008]]

Western Australia did not receive significant flows of [[Immigration to Australia|migrants]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]] or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]] until the early twentieth century when local projects &mdash; such as the Group Settlement Scheme of the 1920s which encouraged farmers to settle the southwest &mdash; increased awareness of Australia's western third as a destination for colonists. 

Led by migrants from the British Isles, Western Australia's population developed at a faster rate during the twentieth century it had previously. Along with the eastern states, Western Australia received large numbers of [[Italian Australian|Italians]], [[Croatian Australian|Yugoslavs]] and [[Greek Australian|Greeks]] after [[World War II]]. Despite this, Britain has contributed the greatest number of migrants to this day, and Western Australia &mdash; particularly Perth &mdash; has the highest proportion of British-born of any state: 10.6% in 2006, compared to a national average of 5.3%. This group is heavily concentrated in certain parts of the [[metropolitan area]] such as [[Joondalup, Western Australia|Joondalup]] where they account for a quarter of the population.

[[Image:WApopDist2006.png|thumb|right|Distribution of the Western Australian population]]

In terms of ethnic groups, 2001 census data reveal that Western Australia is highly diverse: the largest single group was those reporting English ancestry or ethnicity, accounting for 733,783 responses (32.7%), followed by Australian with 624,259 (27.8%), [[Irish Australian|Irish]] with 171,667 (7.6%), [[Italian Australian|Italian]] with 96,721 (4.3%), [[Scottish people|Scottish]] with 62,781 (2.8%), [[German Australian|German]] with 51,672 (2.3%) and [[Chinese Australian|Chinese]] with 48,894 responses (2.2%). There were 58,496 Indigenous Australians in Western Australia in 2001, forming 3.1% of the population.

In terms of birthplace, according to the 2006 census <ref name="2006CensusQuickStats">[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?&action=401&tabname=Summary&areacode=5&issue=2006&producttype=QuickStats&textversion=true&navmapdisplayed=true&&breadcrumb=PLD& 2006 Census QuickStats: Western Australia, October 2007]</ref> 27.1% of the population were born overseas &mdash; higher than the Australian average of 22.2%. 8.9% of West Australians were born in [[England]], 2.4% in [[New Zealand]], 1.2% in [[Scotland]], 1.1% in [[South Africa]], and 1.1% in [[Italy]].

Perth's metropolitan area had an estimated population of 1.55 million in 2007 (75% of the state). Other significant population centres include [[Mandurah, Western Australia|Mandurah]] (approx. 73,000), [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]] (32,000), [[Kalgoorlie]](30,000), [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] (36,000), [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] (29,000), [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]] (13,000), and [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] (15,000).<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3218.02006-07?OpenDocument|title=Estimated Resident Population, WA|publisher=ABS|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{seealso|Economy of Western Australia|}}

[[Image:Aerial view of Fremantle.JPG|thumbnail|right|220px|Aerial view of Fremantle Harbour, a major port in WA]]

Western Australia's economy is largely driven by extraction and processing of a diverse range of mineral and [[petroleum]] commodities. The structure of the economy is closely linked to the abundance of natural resources found in the State, providing a comparative advantage in resource extraction and processing. As a consequence:
* the Western Australian economy is more capital-intensive than all the other states.<ref name="Structure2005">{{citeweb|url=http://www.dtf.wa.gov.au/cms/uploadedFiles/structure_wa_economy_2005.pdf|title=Structure of the WA Economy|publisher=WA Department of Treasury and Finance|date=24 Jan 2006 2008|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref>
* [[Gross state product]] per person ($60,845) is the highest of all states (2007 national average was $47,610)<ref name="austEcIndicators">{{citeweb|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/34CE7FFF9776F3F1CA2574B30017CFB2/$File/13500_sep%202008.pdf|title=Australian Economic Indicators|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|year=2008|accessdate=2008-09-11}}</ref>
* Diversification (ie a greater ''range'' of commodities) over the past 15 years has provided a more balanced production base and less reliance on just a few major export markets, insulating the economy from fluctuations in world prices (eg high oil and gas prices help sustain export income when prices of other commodities such as alumina and nickel fall)
* There has been strong growth in the services (finance, insurance and property)  and construction sector, which have increased their share of economic output.<ref name="Structure2005"/>
* Recent growth in global demand for minerals and petroleum, especially in [[China]] (iron-ore) and Japan (for LNG), has ensured economic growth above the national average.

Western Australia's overseas exports accounted for 36% of the nation's total.<ref name="austEcIndicators"/> The state's major export commodies include [[iron-ore]], [[alumina]], crude [[oil]] and [[liquefied natural gas|liquefied natural gas (LNG)]], [[nickel]], [[gold]], [[ammonia]], wheat, wool, and live sheep and cattle.

Western Australia is a major extractor of bauxite, which is also processed into [[alumina]] at three refineries providing more than 20% of total world production. It is the world's third-largest iron-ore producer (15% of the world's total) and extracts 75% of Australia's 240 tonnes of [[gold]]. Diamonds are extracted at [[Argyle diamond mine]] in far north of the Kimberley region. [[Lignite|Coal]] mined at [[Collie, Western Australia|Collie]] is the main fuel for baseload electricity generation in the state's south-west.
[[Image:2007 Resource production WA.png|thumb|right|200px|Western Australia's resource commodity mix]]
Agricultural production in WA is a major contributor to the state and national economy. Although tending to be highly seasonal, 2006-07 wheat production in WA was nearly 10 million tonnes, accounting for almost half the nation's total.<ref name="cropReport">{{citeweb|url=http://abare.gov.au/publications_html/cr/cr_08/cr08_June.pdf|title=2008 Crop Report|publisher=ABARE|date=1 June 2008|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> and providing $1.7 billion in export income.<ref name="WAatAglance">{{citeweb|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/EFF65DC1D23D314FCA25741D000DC292/$File/13065_2008_reissue.pdf|title=WA at a Glance 2008|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=2 April 2008|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> Other significant farm output includes barley, peas<ref name="cropReport"/>, wool, lamb and beef. There is a high level of overseas demand for imports of live animals from WA, driven mainly by South East Asia's feedlots and Middle Eastern countries, where cultural and religious traditions and a lack of storage and refrigeration facilitites favour live animals over imports of processed meat. Approximately 50% of Australia's live cattle exports come from Western Australia.<ref name="LivestockReport">{{citeweb|url=http://abare.gov.au/publications_html/livestock/livestock_08/LiveExports.pdf|title=2008 Live Exports|publisher=ABARE|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref>
 
Resource sector growth in recent years has resulted in significant labour and skills shortages, leading to recent efforts by the state government to encourage interstate and overseas migration.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.gowestnow.com www.gowestnow.com|title=Go West Now|publisher=Government of Western Australia|date=2008|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>. According to the 2006 census <ref name="2006CensusQuickStats"/>, the median individual income was A$500 per week in Western Australia (compared to A$466 in Australia as a whole). The median family income was A$1246 per week (compared to A$1171 for Australia). Recent growth has also contributed to significant rises in average property values in 2006, although values plateaued in 2007. Perth property prices are still the second highest in Australia behind [[Sydney]], and high rental prices continue to be a problem.
[[Image:Kalgoorlie Super Pit.jpg|thumb|left|Kalgoorlie Super Pit - Australia's largest open-cut gold mine]]
South of Perth is the heavy industrial area of [[Kwinana]]. Located here are the nation's largest oil refinery which produces petrol and diesel for local consumption,<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.aip.com.au/pdf/Downstream_Petroleum_2007_Report.pdf|title=Downstream_Petroleum 2007 Report|publisher=Australian Institute of Petroleum|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>, an [[iron]] plant, alumina and [[nickel]] processing, port facilities for grain exports, and support industries for mining and petroleum such as heavy and light engineering, and metal fabrication. Shipbuilding (eg [[Austal Ships]]) and associated support industries are found at nearby [[Henderson, Western Australia|Henderson]], just south of Fremantle. Significant secondary industries include cement and building product manufacturing, flour milling, food processing, animal feed production, automotive body building, and printing.

In recent years, [[Tourism in Australia|tourism]] has grown in importance, with significant numbers of visitors to the state coming from the UK and Ireland (28%), other European countries (14%) [[Singapore]] (16%), [[Japan]] (10%) and [[Malaysia]] (8%).<ref name="WAatAglance"/> Revenue from tourism is a strong economic driver in many of the smaller population centres outside of Perth, especially in coastal locations.

Western Australia also has major wine producing regions in the South West located in the [[Margaret River]] region and Swan Valley. Several wineries produce wine for local consumption and international export. Western Australia has a significant fishing industry. Products for local consumption and export include Western [[Rock Lobsters]], prawns, crabs, shark and tuna, Processing is conducted along the west coast. Whaling ceased at [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] in 1978.

==Government==
{{main|Government of Western Australia}}

Western Australia was granted self-government in 1889 with a bicameral Parliament located in Perth, consisting of the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] (or ''lower house''), which has 59 members; and the [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (or ''upper house''), which has 36 members. Suffrage is universal and compulsory for citizens over 18 years of age.

With the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, Western Australia became a state within Australia's [[Federation|federal]] structure; this involved ceding certain powers to the Commonwealth (or Federal) government in accordance with the Constitution; all powers not specifically granted to the Commonwealth remained solely with the State, however over time the Commonwealth has effectively expanded its powers through increasing control of taxation and financial distribution.

Whilst the sovereign of Western Australia is the Queen of Australia ([[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]), and executive power nominally vested in her State representative the [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] (currently [[Ken Michael]]), executive power rests with the premier and ministers drawn from the party or coalition of parties holding a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. The current Premier is [[Colin Barnett]].

===Secession===
{{main|Secessionism in Western Australia}}
Secessionism has been a recurring feature of Western Australia's political landscape since shortly after European settlement in 1826. Western Australia was the most reluctant participant in the [[Federation of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]].<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2000/40.html Review Essay, New Federation History, Melbourne University Law Review] www.austlii.edu.au </ref> Western Australia did not participate in the earliest federation conference. Longer-term residents of Western Australia were generally opposed to federation; however, the discovery of gold brought many immigrants from other parts of Australia. It was these residents, primarily in Kalgoorlie but also in Albany who voted to join the Commonwealth, and the proposal of these areas being admitted separately was considered.

In a referendum in April 1933, 68% of voters voted for the state to leave the Commonwealth of Australia with the aim of returning to the [[British Empire]] as an autonomous territory. The State Government sent a delegation to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], but the British Government refused to intervene and therefore no action was taken to implement this decision.

For social and cultural reasons the concept of secession is unlikely to be seriously considered in the future, even though  commentators occasionally raise the idea.

==Education==
Education in Western Australia consists of one year of pre-school at age 5, followed by seven years of primary school education. At age 13, students begin five years of secondary education. The final two years of secondary education are currently changing to compulsory. All students who completed Year 10 in 2005 are now required to undertake further studies in Year 11. Students are required to complete the year in which they turn 16 (usually Year 11).

Commencing in 2008 all students will be required to complete 12 years of study before leaving school. Students will have the option to study at a [[Technical and Further Education|TAFE]] college in their eleventh year or continue through high school with a vocational course or a specific University entrance course.

The universities in Western Australia are [[Curtin University of Technology]], [[Murdoch University]], [[Edith Cowan University]], [[University of Notre Dame Australia|University of Notre Dame]] and the [[University of Western Australia]].
