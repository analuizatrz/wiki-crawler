'''Cirque du Soleil''' ([[French language|French]] for "Circus of the Sun") is an entertainment empire based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] and founded in [[Quebec]] in 1984 by two former street performers, [[Guy Laliberté]] and Daniel Gauthier. It was an answer to a call by Commissariat général aux célébrations 1534–1984 of the Quebec Government for the 450th anniversary celebration of the arrival of French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491–1557) to Canada. Gauthier, who left the company in 2001, now owns the ski area [[Le Massif]], on the St. Lawrence River in Quebec. Cirque du Soleil is now "guided" by Laliberté.

==Overview==
It has been described as the modern circus, and focuses upon a storyline as well as amazing performances. It has several resident and touring troupes and draws heavily from the [[circus (performing art)|circus]] tradition. Emphasizing the use of humans as performers, Cirque du Soleil does not make use of [[animal]]s.  Instead, its performances combine elements of street performances and [[busking]], [[circus (performing art)|circus]], [[opera]], [[ballet]], and [[rock music]]. Acts include [[contortion]]ists, [[Juggling|jugglers]], feats of [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strength]], [[clown]]ing, and [[Trapeze|trapeze artists]]. Their [[costume]]s are very colorful. Cirque shows traditionally do not use pre-recorded music; with some exceptions all music is played live, and in many performances the spoken parts are done in [[Cirquish]], an imaginary language invented by the company.

Cirque shows begin as a creative concept, usually with elements of a central story line, a design concept and the selection of a [[composer]] for the music. These elements remain relatively constant throughout the production run of a given show.  

However, the shows also include both "house" and "guest" acts.  House acts are performed by the full-time cast members, some whom may be involved in several [[routines]]. Not all prepared routines are presented in every performance. Guest acts rotate in and out over the run of the show (clowns are typically guest acts). As a result, Cirque shows can vary somewhat performance to performance, and shows tend to evolve over time.  Cirque creators borrow from some of circus's earliest forms (for example, [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary:List of protologisms#B|banquine]] and [[teeterboard]] acts) but also regularly introduce new apparatus. For example, Cirque introduced the use of bungee cords to aerial acts and created a modified tumbling [[trampoline]] called a Power Track, both of which have since been adopted by other circuses. 

Cirque du Soleil recruits acts from different world circuses, including from [[China]] and [[Russia]], blending them into their own style.

Among veteran circus performers, Cirque is regarded as one of the world's best circuses, due to higher than normal pay scales and benefits.

Cirque du Soleil has produced a number of performance [[DVD]]s and soundtrack CDs.

The troupe was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].
