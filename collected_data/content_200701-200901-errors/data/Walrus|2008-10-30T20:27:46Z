The '''walrus''' (''Odobenus rosmarus'') is a large [[pinniped|flippered]] [[marine mammal]] with a discontinuous circumpolar distribution in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[sub-Arctic]] seas of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. The walrus is the only living species in the '''Odobenidae''' [[family (biology)|family]] and '''''Odobenus''''' [[genus]]. It is subdivided into three [[subspecies]]:<ref name=msw3/> the '''Atlantic Walrus''' (''O. rosmarus rosmarus'') found in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the '''Pacific Walrus''' (''O. rosmarus divergens'') found in the [[Pacific Ocean]], and '''''O. rosmarus laptevi''''', found in the [[Laptev Sea]].

The walrus is immediately recognizable due to its prominent [[tusk]]s, [[Vibrissa|whiskers]] and great bulk. Adult Pacific males can weigh up to {{lb to kg|4500|wiki=yes|abbr=yes}},<ref>[http://www.walruses.net/ Walruses - Walrus Facts and Types - walruses.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and, among [[pinniped]]s, are exceeded in size only by the two species of [[elephant seal]]s.<ref name="Fay85">{{cite journal | author = Fay, F.H. | year = 1985 | url = http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/default.html | title = Odobenus rosmarus | journal = [[Mammalian Species]] | volume = 238 | pages = 1-7}}</ref> It resides primarily in shallow oceanic [[Continental shelf|shelf]] habitat, spending a significant proportion of its life on sea ice in pursuit of its preferred diet of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] [[bivalvia|bivalve mollusks]]. It is a relatively long-lived, social animal and is considered a [[keystone species]] in Arctic marine [[ecosystem]]s.  

The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many [[List of indigenous peoples#Circumpolar North|indigenous Arctic peoples]], who have hunted the walrus for its [[meat]], [[fat]], [[skin]], tusks and [[bone]]. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the walrus was the object of heavy commercial exploitation for [[blubber]] and [[walrus ivory|ivory]] and its numbers declined rapidly. Its global population has since rebounded, though the Atlantic and Laptev populations remain fragmented and at historically depressed levels.  

==Etymology==

The origins of the word "walrus" has variously been attributed to combinations of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] words ''walvis'' ("whale") and ''ros'' ("horse")<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/walrus Dictionary.com]</ref> or ''wal'' ("shore") and ''reus'' ("giant").<ref>[http://www.iberianature.com/trivia/etymology_mammals.htm Etymology of mammal names, iberianature.com]</ref> However, the most likely origin of the word is the [[Old Norse]] ''hrossvalr,'' meaning "horse-whale", which was passed in a juxtaposed form to Dutch and the North-German dialects of the [[Hanseatic League]] as ''walros'' and ''Walross''.<ref>Dansk Etymologisk Ordbog, Niels Age Nielsen, Gyldendal 1966</ref>

The now archaic English word for walrus -- ''morse'' -- is widely supposed to have come from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]].<ref>"morse, n., etymology of" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. http://dictionary.oed.com/</ref> Thus ''морж'' (morž) in [[Russian language|Russian]], ''mors'' in [[Polish language|Polish]], also ''mursu'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''moršâ'' in [[Saami language|Saami]], later ''morse'' in [[French language|French]], ''morsa'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''morsă'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] etc.  

The compound ''Odobenus'' comes from ''odous'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "tooth") and ''baino'' (Greek for "walk"), based on observations of walruses using their tusks to pull themselves out of the water. ''Divergens'' in [[Latin]] means "turning apart", referring to the tusks.

==Taxonomy and evolution== 
The walrus is a mammal in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]. It is the sole surviving member of the [[family (biology)|family]] Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the [[suborder]] [[Pinnipedia]] along with true seals ([[Phocidae]]), and eared seals ([[Otariidae]]). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are [[monophyletic]], i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or [[diphyletic]], recent genetic evidence suggests that all three descended from a [[Caniform]] ancestor most closely related to modern [[bear]]s.<ref name=Lento1995>{{cite journal | author = Lento, G.M., Hickson, R.E., Chambers, G.K., Penny, D. | year = 1995 | title = Use of spectral analysis to test hypotheses on the origin of pinnipeds | title = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 28-52}}</ref> There remains uncertainty as to whether the odobenids diverged from the otariids before or after the phocids,<ref name=Lento1995/> though the most recent synthesis of the molecular data suggests that the phocids were the first to diverge.<ref name=Arnason06>{{cite journal | author = Arnason U, Gullberg A, Janke A, et al. | year = 2006 | title = Pinniped phylogeny and a new hypothesis for their origin and dispersal | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 345-354}}</ref> What is known, however, is that Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty known species in the Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae subfamilies.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kohno, N. | year = 2006 | title = A new Miocene Odobenid (Mammalia: Carnivora) from Hokkaido, Japan, and its implications for odobenid phylogeny | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 411}}</ref> The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining ([[relict]]) species. 

Two subspecies of the walrus are commonly recognized: the Atlantic Walrus, ''O. r. rosmarus'' (Illiger, 1815) and the '''Pacific Walrus''', ''O. r. divergens'' (Linnaeus, 1758). Fixed genetic differences between the Atlantic and Pacific subspecies indicate very restricted gene flow, but relatively recent separation, estimated to have occurred 500,000 and 785,000 years ago.<ref name=Hoelzel2002>{{cite book | editor = Hoelzel, A.

(Ed.) | year = 2002 | title =  Marine mammal biology: an evolutionary approach | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell Publishing  | id = ISBN 0632 05232 5}}</ref> These dates coincide with the fossil derived hypothesis that the walrus evolved from a tropical or sub-tropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic.<ref name=Hoelzel2002/> From there, it presumably re-colonized the North Pacific during high glaciation periods in the [[Pleistocene]] via the [[Central American Seaway]].<ref name="Arnason06"/> An isolated population of the walrus in the [[Laptev Sea]] is considered by some, including Russian biologists and the canonical Mammal Species of the World,<ref name=msw3/> to be a third subspecies, ''O. r. laptevi'' (Chapskii, 1940), when it was described and is managed as such in Russia.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Chapskii, K.K.  1940 | title = Distribution of the walrus in the Laptev and East Siberian seas | journal = Problemy Severa | voluem = 1940 | issue = 6 | pages = 80-94}}</ref> Where the subspecies separation is not accepted, there remains debate as to whether it should be considered a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies.<ref>{{cite book | author = Born, E.

Smaller numbers of males summer in the [[Gulf of Anadyr]] on the south shore of the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] of Siberia and in Bristol Bay off the south shore of southern Alaska west of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. In the spring and fall they congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the west shores of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter to the south in the Bering Sea along the eastern shore of Siberia south to the northern part of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], and along the southern shore of Alaska.<ref name="Fay85"/> A 28,000 year old fossil walrus specimen was dredged out of the [[San Francisco Bay]], indicating that the Pacific Walrus ranged as far south as Northern California during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dyke, A.S., J.

The Atlantic Walrus, which was nearly eradicated by commercial harvest, has a much smaller population. Good estimates are difficult to obtain, but the total number is probably below 20,000.<ref>[NAMMCO] North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission. 1995.

The isolated Laptev population is confined year-round to the central and western regions of the Laptev Sea, the easternmost regions of the [[Kara Sea]], and the westernmost regions of the [[East Siberian Sea]].

==Description==
[[Image:Walrus2.jpg|thumb|right|Young male Pacific Walruses on [[Cape Pierce]] in [[Alaska]]. Note the variation in the curvature and orientation of the tusks and the bumpy skin (bosses), typical of males.]]
[[Image:WalrusBreathing.jpg|thumb|right|Walrus using tusks to hang on breathing hole in the ice near [[St. Lawrence Island]], Bering Sea.]]
[[Image:WalrusLyd2.png|thumb|right|Skeleton]]
While isolated Pacific males can weigh as much as {{lb to kg|4400|abbr=yes}}, most weigh between {{lb to kg|1760|abbr=yes}} and {{lb to kg|4000|abbr=yes}}. Females weigh about two thirds as much as males, and the Atlantic subspecies is about 90% as massive as the Pacific subspecies.<ref name="Fay85"/> The Atlantic Walrus also tends to have relatively shorter tusks and somewhat more flattened [[snout]]s. The body shape of the walrus is in several ways intermediate between that of [[eared seal]]s (Otariidae) and [[earless seal|true seals]] (Phocidae). As with otariids, it has a prominent thick neck and the ability to turn its rear flippers forward and move on all fours; however, its swimming technique is more similar to that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements.<ref name="Fay85"/> Also like phocids, it lacks external ears. 

The most prominent physical feature of the walrus is its long tusks, actually elongated [[canine teeth|canines]], which are present in both sexes and can reach a length of {{m to ft|1|wiki=yes|abbr=yes}} and weigh up to  {{kg to lb|5.4|abbr=yes}}.<ref>{{cite book | author = Berta, A. and J. L. Sumich | year = 1999 | title = Marine mammals: evolutionary biology | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego, CA | pages = 494 pp.}}</ref> These are slightly longer and thicker among males, who use them for fighting, dominance and display; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominating social groups. Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and haul out onto ice.<ref name="Fay82">{{cite journal | author = Fay, F. H. | year = 1982 | title = Ecology and Biology of the Pacific Walrus, Odobenus rosmarus divergens Illiger | journal = United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref> It was previously assumed that tusks were used to dig out prey items from the seabed, but analyses of abrasion patterns on the tusks indicate that they are dragged through the sediment while the upper edge of the snout is used for digging.<ref name="Ray06">{{cite journal | author = Ray, C., McCormick-Ray, J., Berg, P., Epstein, H.E., | year = 2006 | title = Pacific Walrus: Benthic bioturbator of Beringia | journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology | pages = 403-419}}</ref> The walrus has relatively few teeth other than the great canine tusks, and typically has a [[dentition|dental formula]] of:{{dentition2|1.1.3.0|0.1.3.0}}

Surrounding the tusks is a broad mat of stiff bristles ('mystacial [[vibrissa]]e'), giving the walrus a characteristic whiskered appearance. There can be 400 to 700 vibrissae in 13 to 15 rows reaching {{cm to in|30|abbr=yes|precision=0}} in length, though in the wild they are often worn to a much shorter length due to constant use in foraging.<ref name=Kastelein1990>{{cite journal | author = Kastelein, R.A., Stevens, S., & Mosterd, P. | year = 1990 | title = The sensitivity of the vibrissae of a Pacific Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens). Part 2: Masking | journal = Aquatic Mammals | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 78-87}}</ref> The vibrissae are attached to muscles and are supplied with blood and nerves making the vibrissal array a highly sensitive organ capable of differentiating shapes {{cm to in|0.3|abbr=yes|precision=2}} thick and {{cm to in|0.2|abbr=yes|precision=2}} wide.<ref name="Kastelein1990"/>

Aside from the vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly wrinkled and thick, up to {{cm to in|10|abbr=yes|precision=0}} around the neck and shoulders of males. The [[blubber|blubber layer]] beneath is up to {{cm to in|15|abbr=yes|precision=0}} thick. Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler and more cinnamon colored as they age. Old males, in particular, become nearly pink. Because the blood vessels in the skin constrict in cold water, the walrus can appear almost white when swimming. As a [[secondary sexual characteristic]], males also acquire significant nodules, called ''bosses'', particularly around the neck and shoulders.<ref name="Fay82"/>    

The walrus has an air sac under its throat which acts like a flotation bubble and allows the walrus to bob vertically in the water and sleep. The males possess a large [[baculum]] (penis bone), up to {{cm to in|63|abbr=yes|precision=0}} in length, the largest of any land mammal, both relative to body size and in absolute terms.<ref name="Fay85"/>

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Noaa-walrus12.jpg|thumb|left|Walruses fighting]]

The walrus lives around 50 years. The males reach sexual maturity as early as 7 years, but do not typically mate until fully developed around 15 years of age. They go into a rut in January through April, decreasing their food intake dramatically. The females can begin ovulating as soon as 4–6 years old. The females are polyestrous, coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are only fertile around February; the potential fertility of this second period of estrous is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March with peak conception in February. Males aggregate in the water around ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays.<ref>{{cite journal | author = S. N. Nowicki, Ian Stirling, Becky Sjare | year = 1997 | title = Duration of stereotypes underwater vocal displays by make Atlantic walruses in relation to aerobic dive limit | journal = Marine Mammal Science | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 566–575}}</ref> The females join them and copulation occurs in the water.<ref name="Fay82"/> 

Total [[gestation]] lasts 15 to 16 months, though 3 to 4 of those months are spent with the [[blastula]] in suspended development before finally implanting itself in the placenta. This strategy of [[delayed implantation]], common among other pinnipeds, presumably evolved to optimize both the season when females select their mates and the season when the birth itself occurs, determined by ecological conditions that promote survival of the young.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sandell, M. | year = 1990 | title = The Evolution of Seasonal Delayed Implantation | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 23-42}}</ref> The calves are born during the spring migration from April to June. They weigh {{kg to lb|45|abbr=yes}} to {{kg to lb|75|abbr=yes}} at birth and are able to swim. The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning, but the young can spend up to 3 to 5 years with the mothers.<ref name="Fay82"/> Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned, females give birth at most once every two years, resulting in the walrus having the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped.<ref>{{cite book | editor = Evans, P.G.H. & Raga, J.A. (eds) | year = 2001 | title = Marine mammals: biology and conservation | location = London & New York | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press}}</ref> 

In the non-reproductive season (late summer and fall) the walrus tends to migrate away from the ice and form massive aggregations of tens of thousands of individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The nature of the migration between the reproductive period and the summer period can be a rather long distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific Walruses migrate from the Bering sea into the Chukchi sea through the relatively narrow [[Bering Strait]].<ref name="Fay82"/> 

==Feeding==
[[Image:Walrus - Kamogawa Seaworld - 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vibrissa]]e of captive walrus (Japan)]]
[[Image:Walross paar.jpg|thumb|right|Walruses leaving the water]]

The walrus prefers shallow shelf regions and forages on the sea bottom. Its dives are not particularly deep compared to other pinnipeds; the deepest recorded dives are around {{m to ft|80|abbr=yes}}. However, it can remain submerged for as long as a half hour.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schreer, J. F., K. M. Kovacs, and R. J. O'Hara Hines | year = 2001 | title = Comparative diving patterns of pinnipeds and seabirds | journal = Ecological Monographs | volume = 71 | pages = 137–162}}</ref> 

The walrus has a highly diverse and opportunistic diet, feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms including [[shrimp]]s, [[crab]]s, [[tube worm]]s, soft [[coral]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s, various [[mollusk]]s, and even parts of other pinnipeds.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sheffield G, Fay FH, Feder H, Kelly BP | year = 2001 | title = Laboratory digestion of prey and interpretation of walrus stomach contents | journal = Mar Mammal Sci | volume = 17| pages = 310–330}}</ref> However, it displays great preference for benthic bivalve mollusks, especially species of [[clam]]s, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Levermann, N., Galatius, A., Ehlme, G., Rysgaard, S. and Born, E.W. | year = 2003 | title = Feeding behaviour of free-ranging walruses with notes on apparent dextrality of flipper use | journal = BMC Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/3/9/}}</ref> The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing the organism in the powerful lips and drawing the tongue, piston-like, rapidly into the mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, allowing for extremely effective suction to be generated by the tongue. 

Aside from the large numbers of organisms actually consumed by the walrus, it has a large peripheral impact on the benthic communities while foraging. It disturbs ([[bioturbation|bioturbates]]) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.<ref name="Ray06"/>

Seal tissue has been observed in fairly significant proportion of walrus stomachs in the Pacific, but the importance of seals in the walrus diet is debated.<ref>{{cite book | author = Lowry, L.F. and Frost, K.J. | year = 1981 | chapter = Feeding and Trophic Relationships of Phocid Seals and walruses in the Eastern Bering Sea | title = The Eastern Bering Sea Shelf: Oceanography & Resources vol. 2. | editor = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) | publisher = University of Washington Press | pages = 813-824}}</ref> There have been rare documented incidents of predation on seabirds, particularly the [[Brünnich's Guillemot]] ''Uria lomvia''.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mallory, M.L., Woo, K., Gaston, A.J.,  Davies, W.E.,  and Mineau, P | year = 2004 | title = Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) predation on adult thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) at Coats Island, Nunavut, Canada | journal = Polar Research | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 111–114}}</ref>

Due to its great size, the walrus has only two natural predators: the [[orca]] and the [[polar bear]]. It does not, however, comprise a significant component of either predator's diet. The polar bear hunts the walrus by rushing at beached aggregations and consuming those individuals that are crushed or wounded in the sudden mass exodus, typically younger or infirm animals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ovsyanikov, N. | year = 1992 | title = Ursus ubiquitous | journal = BBC Wildlife | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 18-26}}</ref> However, even an injured walrus is a formidable opponent for a polar bear, and direct attacks are rare.

==Exploitation and status==

[[Image:PolarBearWalrusTuskCarving.jpg|thumb|right|Walrus tusk engraving made by [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] artisans depicting polar bears attacking walruses. On display in the Magadan Regional Museum, [[Magadan]], Russia.]]

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus was heavily exploited by American and European [[Seal hunting|sealers]] and [[Whaling|whalers]], leading to the near extirpation of the Atlantic population.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bockstoce, J.R. and D.B.

Freeman, and J.C. Makus | year = 1996 | title = Use and preference for Traditional Foods among Belcher Island Inuit | journal = Artic | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 256-264}}</ref> and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form among many communities.

Walrus hunts are regulated by resource managers in [[Russia]], the [[U.S.]], [[Canada]] and [[Denmark]] and representatives of the respective walrus hunting communities. An estimated four to seven thousand Pacific Walruses are harvested in Alaska and Russia, including a significant portion (approx. 42%) of struck and lost animals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Garlich-Miller, J.G. and D.M. Burn | year = 1997 | title = Estimating the harvest of Pacific walrus, ''Odobenus rosmarus divergens'', in Alaska | journal | Fish.

W. | year = 2005 | title = An assessment of Greenland walrus populations | journal = ICES Journal of Marine Science | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 266-284}}</ref> The sustainability of these levels of harvest are difficult to determine since there is considerable uncertainty in the population estimates themselves and in the population parameters such as [[fecundity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]].  

The effects of [[global climate change]] on the walrus populations is another element of concern. In particular, there have been well-documented reductions on the extent and thickness of the pack ice which the walrus relies on as a substrate for giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. It is hypothesized that thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of suitable resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds.

==Folklore and culture==

The walrus plays an important role in the religion and [[folklore]] of many [[Arctic]] peoples. The skin and bones are used in some ceremonies and the animal itself appears frequently in legends. For example, in a [[Chukchi]] version of the widespread [[Raven in mythology|myth of the Raven]], in which [[Kutkh|Raven]] recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus &mdash; possibly the original walrus. According to various versions, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids.<ref name="Bogoras">W. Bogoras. (1902) The Folklore of Northeastern Asia, as Compared with That of Northwestern America. ''American Anthropologist, New Series'', Vol. 4, No. 4. (Oct. - Dec., 1902), pp. 577-683.</ref> This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]]. Both in [[Chukotka]] and [[Alaska]], the [[aurora borealis]] is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.<ref name="Bogoras"/><ref>Boas, F. 1901. Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. History, Vol. xvr, Pt. I. New York, p. 146</ref>

Because of its distinctive appearance and immediately recognizable whiskers and tusks, the walrus also appears in the popular cultures of peoples with little immediate experience with the animal, most often in children's literature. Perhaps its best known appearance is in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s whimsical poem ''[[The Walrus and the Carpenter]]'' that appears in his book ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871). In the poem, the [[eponymous]] [[anti-heroes]] use trickery to consume a great number of [[oyster]]s.  Although Carroll accurately portrays the biological walrus's appetite for bivalve mollusks, oysters do not naturally occur within the Arctic and [[sub-Arctic]] range of the walrus.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

The Walrus from Lewis Carroll's poem was the inspiration for [[The Beatles]] song ''[[I Am the Walrus]]'', written by [[John Lennon]]. Lennon referred to the song, and the Walrus, in two other songs, ''[[Glass Onion]]'' and ''[[God]]''. [[Paul McCartney]] is dressed as a walrus on the cover of The Beatles' album on which ''I am the Walrus'' appears, ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'', while Lennon himself appeared in walrus drag in the film of the song that appears in the ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' film. At the time the song appeared, and years before Lennon himself explained that the Carroll poem was the genesis of the song, there was speculation on what the walrus symbolized in The Beatles song. During the "[[Paul is Dead]]" imbroglio, journalist John Neary, the author of the cover story "The Magical McCartney Mystery" in [[LIFE Magazine]]'s November 7, 1969 issue, incorrectly claimed that the "black walrus was a folk symbol of death."<ref>[http://www.turnmeondeadman.net/IBP/Walrus.php#footnotes I Am the Walrus - I Buried Paul - Turn Me On, Dead Man<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Other examples of appearance of the animal in the popular culture include [[The Jungle Book]] story by [[Rudyard Kipling]], where it is the "''old Sea Vitch—the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners except when he is asleep''" who tells the white seal Kotick where to seek advice for his mission.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
