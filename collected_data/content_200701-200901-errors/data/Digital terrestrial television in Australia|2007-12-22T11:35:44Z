'''[[Digital terrestrial television]] in [[Australia]]''' commenced on [[January 1]] [[2001]], in the country's five most populous cities, [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. It is anticipated that between [[2010]] and [[2012]] it will replace [[analogue television|Analogue]] [[PAL]] transmissions. Although approximately 96% of the population has access to at least one digital service,<ref name="ausnow">{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/broadcasting.html |title=Australia Now: Broadcasting and online content |accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]}}</ref> in [[March]] [[2007]], only 28% of Australia's 7.8 million households had adopted free-to-air digital television.<ref name="adoption">{{cite web |url=http://www.dba.org.au/newsletter/IB-MayJun07-full.asp#PRODUCT1 |title=Australian household adoption of free to view digital television continues to rise

The new means of broadcast has brought with it a number of enhancements, primarily higher-quality picture and sound, but also datacast and multi-view services such as [[electronic program guide|video program guide]]s, [[High-definition television|high definition]], and now-and-next program information. There are a number of additional [[Television channel|channels]], [[datacasting]], as well as [[High-definition television|high definition]] services, available to digital terrestrial television viewers in Australia. Digital-only content is subject to availability and differs greatly in various television markets.

==History==
===Planning===
Planning for digital terrestrial television in Australia can be traced back to [[1993]], when a group of specialists was drawn from the then-[[Australian Broadcasting Authority]], Department of Transport and Communications, in addition to broadcasters and manufacturers. The ABA Specialist Group was intended to bring together studies taking place in a number of Australian forums and investigate potential options and policies relating to digital television.<ref name="aba1995">{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_90479 |title= Digital - THE BIGGEST advance in TV since color in the 1970's? |accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Authority]]}}</ref>

In [[1995]] the group released a report, ''Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting in Australia'', containing the preliminary conclusions of the group. It found that premature regulation of the new platform may stifle the market-driven development of the service, that it should be based upon existing standards, and should not restrict the ability of broadcasters to tailor local content.<ref name="aba1995" /> It was too early at the time to make decisions relating to what standard should be used, when transmissions should commence, and whether analogue television should be phased out.

The final report, of the same name, was released in [[1997]].<ref name="aba1997">{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_90714 |title=  ABA to release report on digital terrestrial television broadcasting |accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Authority]]}}</ref> It recommended that Australia should adopt a single system following detailed trials of potential systems, that it should be implemented with [[High Definition Television|high definition]] capabilities from the outset, that each licensed commercial or public service should have access to a full 7Mhz channel for its services, and that the eventual termination of [[analogue television|analogue]] [[PAL]] services should be driven by market factors and subject to regular review.<ref name="tbs1998">{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/bd/1997-98/98bd178.htm |title=  Bills Digest No. 178  1997-98: Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 |accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library}}</ref> The year [[2000]] was highlighted as a potential target date for the commencement of permanent digital terrestrial broadcasting.<ref name="tbs1998" />

The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled ''Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting'', recommended that the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] support the early introduction of digital broadcasting as a [[free-to-air]] service with the loan of a 7Mhz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable [[high-definition television]] from the outset.<ref name="tbs1998" /> The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations supported this, as well as freedom for its members to launch multi-channel services. At the same time, the [[Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association]], questioned the commercial viability of [[High-definition television|HDTV]], were opposed to the idea of multi-channeling, and argued for a competitive system that would allow the entry of new players.

The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] stated that it wished to run up to four multichannels at different times of the day or alternatively offer a HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million would be needed to prepare for these services, half of which would need to be government-funded.<ref name="tbs1998" /> Other interested parties, such as [[internet service provider]] [[OzEmail]] argued for the provision of spectrum for [[interactive television|interactive]] services, while [[Telstra]], shareholder in the [[subscription television]] provider [[Foxtel]], supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.<ref name="tbs1998" />

===Legislation===
On [[March 24]], [[1998]], [[Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts]], Senator [[Richard Alston]], announced the government's decisions for the introduction of digital television. The plan allowed commercial and public broadcasters 7Mhz of spectrum free of charge for 8 years to simulcast services in both digital and analogue, after which it was to be returned to the Commonwealth.<ref name="tbs1998" /> Digital terrestrial television was to commence on [[January 1]], [[2001]] in metropolitan areas, with expansion to regional areas to have been completed by the start of [[2004]].<ref name="tbs1998" /> 

Following this, commercial broadcasters would be required to provide minimum levels of [[High Definition Television|high definition]] content, will be required to pay fees if they chose to provide datacast services, and would be prohibited from using their spectrum for multichanneling of subscription services. In addition, the prohibition on new free-to-air broadcasters would be extended until [[December]], [[2008]].<ref name="tbs1998" />

Amendments were subsequently made to the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992'' and the ''Radiocommunications Act 1992'', which set out ownership and programming conditions for broadcasting licenses (administered by the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority|ABA]]) and regulated the usage of spectrum, respectively.<ref name="tbs1998" />

On [[June 18]], [[1998]], the Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting Selection Panel announced the choice of the [[Europe]]an [[DVB-T]] system for digital terrestrial television.<ref name="dtvrec">{{cite press release |title=Digital Television System Recommendation |publisher=Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations |date=1998-06-18 |url=http://happy.emu.id.au/lab/news/news/rmb114.htm |accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> The panel was a group of representatives comprised of representatives from the country's public, commercial and regional broadcasters, the Department of Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, as well as the Australian Broadcasting Authority.

===Launch===
When digital television launched on [[January 1]], [[2001]], the majority of households did not know of or were unable to buy a [[set top box]] in order to receive the signal. <ref name="730report">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s229316.htm |title=The 7.30 Report: Does anyone care about digital television? |accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |year=[[2001]]}}</ref> Digital Broadcasting Australia was established in late [[2000]] to help make the transition to digital television as seamless for consumers as possible.

During [[September]] [[2007]], the three commercial networks announced the introduction of high-definition only channels later that year, becoming the first new commercial television channels to launch in metropolitan areas of Australia since [[1988]]. The Seven Network's [[Seven HD]] was the first to launch on [[October 15]] and became available through [[Prime Television]] on [[October 29]]. This was followed by the launch of [[Ten HD]] on [[December 16]]. The majority of the programming on the high-definition channels is [[simulcast]] from the parent channel.

On [[September 23]] the [[John Howard|Howard]] [[Government of Australia|government]] announced plans, if re-elected after the [[2007 Australian federal election]], to launch [[ABC3]] - a digital-only children's television service, to be run by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] alongside existing multichannel [[ABC2]].

[[Image:Digitaltv4 freetoview epg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Digital Forty Four]] [[Channel 4 (Australia)|video program guide]] available to digital viewers in [[Sydney]].]]
A number of broadcasters, primarily commercial networks, have provided a number of digital-only datacast or multivew services on separate channels - in particular during major sporting events. The [[Seven Network]], for instance, provided two additional channels as part of its coverage of the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] - one providing alternate commentary, the other with statistics and game information.<ref> {{cite web

[[Digital Forty Four]], a trial [[datacasting]] service, began in [[Sydney]] in [[2003]]. The service included at launch an [[electronic program guide]], [[ABC News and Current Affairs|ABC News, Sport and Weather]] datacast service, the [[Australian Christian Channel]], shopping channel [[Expo]] and a number of [[Australian parliament|federal parliament]] audio streams.

===High-definition===
At a minimum, all digital [[Australian television broadcasting|television broadcasters]] in Australia provide a [[576i]]  [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] service, in addition to [[High-definition television|high definition]]. With the notable exception of the [[Golden West Network]] and [[WIN Television]] in [[Western Australia]], all commercial broadcasters provide [[1080i]], while [[ABC TV]] provides a [[720p]] high definition simulcast. [[SBS TV]] currently broadcast in [[576p]] (technically [[Enhanced-definition television|enhanced definition]], although under Australian regulations considered high definition) with plans to move to [[720p]] high definition in [[2008]].<ref name="sbs720p"> {{cite web
