"'''Hey Baby'''" is a [[pop music|pop]] song written by [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Tony Kanal]], [[Tom Dumont]], and [[Bounty Killer]] for [[No Doubt]]'s fifth studio album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001).  The song is heavily influenced by the [[Jamaica]]n [[dancehall]] music present at No Doubt's post-show parties and tour bus lounges of their ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' tour.<ref name="singles"/>  Its lyrics describe the debauchery with [[groupie]]s at these parties.

The song received positive reviews from music critics, though the song's dancehall influences had a mixed reception.  It was released as the album's [[lead single]] in October 2001 (see [[2001 in music]]).  The single was commercially successful and peaked at number five on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]].  At the [[45th Grammy Awards]], "Hey Baby" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].

==Background and writing==
"Hey Baby" was one of the first songs written for ''Rock Steady''.<ref>"No Doubt".  ''Front Row Center''.  [[Fox Family]].  [[February 18]], [[2002]].</ref>  The song began with instrumentals programmed with producer [[Philip Steir]] at Toast Studios in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref name="singles">Montoya, Paris and Lanham, Tom.  "Hey Baby featuring Bounty Killer".  ''[[The Singles 1992-2003]]'' (liner notes).  [[Interscope Records]].  [[November 25]], [[2003]].</ref>  They experimented with [[raygun]]-like electronic effects and sounds that guitarist [[Tom Dumont]] compared to [[Star Wars Music|''Star Wars'' music]].<ref>"No Doubt".  ''Mean Street''.  Volume 12, issue 6.  December 2001.</ref>  The lyrics and melodies were recorded at a session at Dumont's home studio in [[Los Angeles]] weeks later.  While the band was working on the album in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica during March 2001, producers Sly & Robbie left the percussion and [[Gwen Stefani]]'s original vocal.<ref name="singles"/>  The band asked about adding a guest appearance on the song, so Sly & Robbie recommended and added a [[toasting|toast]] from Bounty Killer.<ref>Reid, Nadine.

Like the song's dancehall style, the lyrics depict the band's post-show parties from touring in support of ''Return of Saturn''.  The song details female groupies who attended the parties to hook up with the male band members.  Stefani commented that "if you're talented and you're up there, girls want to make out with you."  Bassist Tony Kanal described it as "a very [[MPAA film rating system#Ratings|PG]] version" of the licentiousness that took place while touring.<ref>Wiederhorn, Jon and Rankin, Rebecca.

Retrieved [[July 12]], [[2007]].</ref>  The song also touches on ''Rock Steady''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s overall theme of Stefani's impatience in her [[long-distance relationship]] with then-boyfriend [[Gavin Rossdale]], as she sits "sipping on chamomile/watching boys and girls and their sex appeal".<ref name="slant">Cinquemani, Sal.

"Hey Baby" is a [[ragga]] song composed in the key of [[E minor]].  It is written in [[common time]] and moves at a moderate tempo of 90 [[beats per minute]].<ref name="sheet">Sheet music for "Hey Baby".

The song opens with an [[introduction (music)|introduction]] consisting of a sustained [[bar (music)|measure]] of electronic effects followed by two lines from the [[refrain|chorus]].  In each two-measure line during the first half of the verses, Stefani descends the scale while the keyboard plays the [[off-beat (music)|off-beats]] of the first measure and the [[bass guitar|electric bass]] opens the line with a two-note [[bassline]].  During the second half of the verses, Stefani's vocals are [[overdubbed]], and the instrumentation becomes more frequent.<ref>Guitar tab for "Hey Baby".  [[Hal Leonard Corporation]].  2001.</ref>  Each of the two verses is followed by the chorus, where overdubbing is used on Stefani's vocals to produce [[first inversion]] and normal form [[E minor]] chords.  Bounty Killer then toasts the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], and after a brief section sung by Stefani, the song closes by repeating the chorus twice.<ref name="sheet"/>

==Music video==

The song's [[music video]], directed by [[Dave Meyers]], follows the theme of the lyrics.  It shows the band on a tour bus, stopping at a party at Club Poonani.  The members separate when three girls approach the male band members.  Kanal has his picture taken with several women, paying for it by taking money that drummer [[Adrian Young]] earns by hanging from [[gymnastics rings]] naked.  Dumont defeats a woman, portrayed by Sonya Eddy, in an endurance [[drinking game]], and Stefani dances, eventually joining Bounty Killer on stage.<ref name="video">"Hey Baby".  ''[[Making the Video]]''.  [[MTV]].

The video was filmed in three days in [[Boyle Heights]], Los Angeles.<ref>[http://www.bountykiller.com/killerartman/publish/article_158.shtml "No Doubt and Bounty from Orange County."]  BountyKiller.com.  Retrieved [[July 9]], [[2007]].</ref>  The scenes were designed to recreate the parties that the band attended while recording ''Rock Steady'' in Jamaica.  Young's scene was based on an actual event, where he won [[US$]]200 on a dare to hang upside down and naked on the rings at a club in [[New York]].  Dumont's scene, filmed at Casa Mexicana, is inspired by a similar scene from the 1981 [[Indiana Jones franchise|Indiana Jones]] film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.<ref name="video"/>

Young's full frontal on the rings, shown during Bounty Killer's line "The way you rock your hips, you know that it amaze me," was controversial.  The scene was mocked by the [[homophobic]] dancehall community in Jamaica, where [[LGBT rights in Jamaica|sex between men is illegal]].<ref>Huey, Steve.
