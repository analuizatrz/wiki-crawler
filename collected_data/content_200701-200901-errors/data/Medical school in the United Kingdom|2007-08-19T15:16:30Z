In the [[United Kingdom]], '''medical school''' generally refers to a department within a [[university]] which is involved in the education of future [[medical doctor|medical practitioners]]. All leading British medical schools are in the government sector and their core purpose is to train doctors on behalf of the [[National Health Service]].

==Admissions==
In the United Kingdom students generally commence their medical studies without any preliminary higher education, typically at the age of eighteen or nineteen. This contrasts with the U.S. system, where a preliminary [[bachelor's degree]] is required for entry to medical school. Entry to British medical schools is very competitive. Courses last five or six years. The medical education itself takes five years, consisting of an aggregate of 2 years of preclinical training in an academic environment and three years of clinical training at a [[teaching hospital]]; the way these two elements are integrated varies between medical schools and is currently in a state of flux. Medical schools and teaching hospitals are closely integrated. The overall course of study is extended to six years if an intercalated degree is taken (see  below for details). 

After successful completion of clinical training a student graduates as a [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]], usually abbreviated as [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery|'MBChB']] (at the universities of [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[University of Dundee|Dundee]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], [[University of Leicester|Leicester]], [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]], [[Keele University|Keele]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]], and [[University of Warwick|Warwick]]). It is also abbreviated as [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery|'MBBS']] for the universities of [[University of East Anglia|UEA]], [[Hull York Medical School|HYMS]], [[University of London|London]], and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]]; [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery|'MBBCh']] for [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]] and [[University of Wales Swansea|Swansea]]; [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery|'BMBCh']] for [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery|'BMBS']] for [[University of Nottingham]], [[Peninsula Medical School]] and [[Brighton and Sussex Medical School|Brighton-Sussex]], [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery|'BM']] for [[University of Southampton|Southampton]], and [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery|'MBBChir']] for [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. [[Queen's University Belfast]] gives the degree of 'MBBChBAO' (BAO is Bachelor of the Art of Obstetrics). The [[Bute Medical School]] ([[University of St Andrews]]) offers a pre-clinical [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] or [[Bachelor of Science|BSc(Hons)]] with subsequent entry to Manchester or [[Keele University Medical School|Keele]] for Clinical Teaching, and a [[University of Manchester|Manchester]] [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery|MBChB]] (it is sometimes possible for entrants to negotiate transfer to another medical school for clinical training, such as Glasgow or Dundee).

Applications for entry into medical school (in common with other university courses) are made through the [[UCAS|Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]].  UCAS generally allows students to apply for up to six places at different universities, however applicants for medical school may use only four of these places for medical courses, the remaining two must be left blank or be used to apply for non-medical courses, with many students applying for courses in biomedical science, medical [[genetics]] etc. as insurance options. Most UK medical schools now also require applicants to sit additional entrance tests such as the [[UKCAT|United Kingdom Clinical Aptitude Test]] (required by 23 universities) and the [[BMAT|BioMedical Admissions Test]] (required by 6 universities).

Other primary medical qualifications registrable with the [[General Medical Council]] exist in the UK, some of which have only recently become defunct, and many people in the UK still practising medicine have these qualifications.  These include the 'LMSSA' (the licentiate in Medicine and Surgery of the [[Society of Apothecaries]]), the 'LRCP, MRCS' ([[conjoint|conjoint diploma of the London Royal Colleges]]) and the 'LRCPE, LRCSE, LRCPSG' (the 'Scottish Triple Diploma', given by the Royal Colleges in Glasgow and Edinburgh).

==Course structure==
{{Unreferenced|date=December 2006}}

Traditionally the delivery of medical education has been divided into two distinct styles.  '''[[Problem-based learning]]''' (PBL) aims to develop a mature and self-sufficient style of learning by encouraging students to work in groups on solving clinical scenarios with little factual input from tutors in the form of lectures.  PBL courses have been criticised{{Fact|date=February 2007}} (whether rightly or wrongly) for providing too little support for students, the lack of interaction between teacher and student meaning problems (academic or pastoral) can go unnoticed for a long time, however, PBL courses can offer greater support as problems can be picked up earlier on as the tutor listens to what the student has understood in tutorials, as opposed to lecture-based courses where the lecturer may only listen to what the student has understood during examinations, by which time it is too late to rectify the situation.  The balance of truth in each of these viewpoints depends in part on the quality of the individual course.  It is worth bearing in mind there is, in fact, a lot of variation in the way that both PBL and lecture-based teaching methods are applied at different institutions.   '''Traditional courses''' are classically lecture-intensive with a much more time devoted to didactic teaching.  These courses have been criticised for "spoon-feeding" students and failing to develop in their graduates the ability to cope in the real world{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

The need for balance is recognised by those responsible for shaping medical education - however, this is quite hard to achieve with financial and time constraints for all involved.

Another division of medical curricula is on the basis of whether they belong to the '''traditional pre-clinical/clinical type''', where theoretical teaching (pre-clinical, i.e. microbiology, physiology etc.) is delivered completely separately from the clinical teaching (i.e. communication, diagnosis), or whether they conform to an '''integrated model''', where patient interaction begins much earlier and emphasis is placed on relating the learned physiology to clinical scenarios from the very beginning.

==The immediate post-graduation period==
After graduation medical students enter paid employment, but they are still a year away from obtaining full registration with the [[General Medical Council]]. During this year trainees are legally only able to work in certain highly supervised jobs, as a [[Foundation Year 1|Foundation House Officer 1 (FHO1)]], and cannot legally practise independently.

A new medical graduate's first job will be as a [[Foundation House Officer]] (FHO), during which they will complete the first year of ''Foundation Training''.  Although by this time, they have graduated from the university, it is the responsibility of the medical school they attended to supervise this year until they are fully registered with the General Medical Council.  Therefore, the first year of the [[Foundation House Officer|Foundation Programme]] forms the final year of medical school. 

Students in their final year will begin the process of applying for jobs.  The new system (implemented by the NHS [[Modernising Medical Careers]]) involves a simplified application process without interviews based on a matching scheme - students rank their preferred [[Foundation Schools]] (which often comprise a [[catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] of two or three cities), and are ranked based on the answers given on their application form, the resulting correlation of scores determines which job the student will get when they graduate.  The graduates will embark on a new-style foundation programme consisting of two years (much like the previous PRHO ([[Pre-registration house officer]]) and SHO ([[Senior house officer]]) years) which focus on the seven principles of the MMC training ethos: trainee centred, competency assessed, service based, quality assured, flexible, coached, and structured & streamlined.

The Multi-Deanery Application Process (MDAP) system, which was used for applications to the Foundation Programme in some areas in 2006, came under much criticism within the medical student press ([[Student BMJ]]) and at medical student conferences such as the one held by the BMA in March 2006 where there was  dissatisfaction with the way London students had been treated. It has also been suggested in letters to ''[[The Times]]'' that some medical students have lied on their MDAP forms.

The MDAP system was replaced by the [[Medical Training Application Service]] (MTAS) system in 2007 which dealt with applications for the Foundation Programme but failed to handle applications for specialty training appointments.<ref>{{cite news| work=Electronic Telegraph| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=QEF2CJZXRZ30NQFIQMFCFF4AVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2007/05/16/ndocs16.xml| title=Hewitt admits defeat on doctors' job fiasco| date=17 May 2007| accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>

== Graduate Entry Programmes ==

Recently several four year graduate entry schemes have been introduced which cover a similar range and depth of knowledge to the undergraduate scheme but at a more intensive pace.  The accelerated pace is largely in the pre-clinical phase of the medical programme, with the GMC mandating a minimum number of clinical hours in the clinical phase of medical degrees.

These courses have a limited number of spaces and include some funding after the first year, so competition is very high. Some sources report in the region of 60 applicants for each place as these courses have become more widely known.  Until relatively recently, people over thirty were strongly discouraged from applying. Entrance to these programmes usually involves sitting a competitive selection test.  The most common entry examinations are the GAMSAT (Graduate Australian Medical Schools Admissions Test [http://www.gamsatuk.org] or MSAT (Medical Schools Admissions Test) [http://www.msat-uk.org].  Some schools may use existing entrance examinations that school leavers are also usually required to take e.g. UKCAT or BMAT (see above).

The admissions criteria for these graduate entry programmes vary between universities - some universities require the applicant's first degree to be in a science-related discipline, whereas others will accept a degree in any subject as sufficient evidence of academic ability.  

For detailed advice about entrance to medical school as a graduate or mature student in the UK, visit the [http://www.medschoolsonline.co.uk Medschools Online] website or [http://www.geocities.com/alexism1974/maturefaq.htm the good 'Mature FAQ' on graduate programmes].  Medical forums and sites such as [http://www.medschoolguide.co.uk] and [http://www.medschoolguide.co.uk/ this] are also helpful.

The following fourteen Universities will be offering four year graduate entry programmes to Medicine for entry in September 2007:

University of Birmingham<br />
University of Bristol<br />
University of Cambridge (candidate may offer BMAT)<br />
King's College, University of London (require MSAT)<br />
University of Leicester (require UKCAT)<br />
University of Liverpool<br />
University of Newcastle (require UKCAT)<br />
University of Nottingham (require GAMSAT)<br />
University of Oxford (require UKCAT)<br />
Barts and The London, Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of London (require MSAT)<br />
University of Southampton (require UKCAT)<br />
St George's, University of London (require GAMSAT)<br />
University of Wales, Swansea (require GAMSAT)<br />
University of Warwick (require MSAT)<br />

Imperial College, University of London will offer graduate entry medicine from September 2008 onwards, requiring the UKCAT.<br />

It must be noted, however, that graduates are free to apply to the regular five/six year courses.  Indeed, universities offering both graduate entry and school leaver entry courses often encourage applications to one of the two course types, depending on the graduate's educational background.

==Intercalated degrees==
Some medical students spend an additional year at medical school (lengthening a five year course to six years) studying for an intercalated degree.  This is an extra degree awarded in addition to their [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|medical degrees]].  This gives the student the opportunity to gain an extra qualification, and aids students' research and individual study skills.  At the end of this ''intercalated year'' students are awarded a degree, usually a BSc, or more rarely a BA, MSc or BMedSci(Hons).  Usually students complete an intercalated BSc/BA/BMedSci(Hons) the year after completing the second or third year of their medical course.  Masters degrees are offered at some schools for students who have completed the fourth year of their medical course. 

The way the programme is implemented varies across the country: sometimes the intercalated degree will be specifically for medical students (e.g. a supervisor-led research project culminating in a dissertation), whilst sometimes the intercalated student will complete courses offered to final year BSc or masters students.  At some medical schools the intercalated degree may be undertaken in a specific subjects (e.g. Immunology, Pathology, Cardiovascular Science, Respiratory Science, Social Medicine, Management, History Of Medicine, Humanities etc), whilst at other medical schools there is a common curriculum for all intercalated students (often with some choice within it).

At many medical schools, the year is optional, and a relatively small percentage of students elect to study for it.  In contrast to this, all students at [[Royal Free and University College Medical School|University College London]], [[Imperial College School of Medicine|Imperial College London]], [[Bute Medical School|Bute Medical School (St Andrews)]], Oxford and Cambridge study for a BSc/BA in addition to their [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|medical degrees]]. These five medical schools have a six-year curriculum, in which students complete a three-year pre-clinical course, which leads to a BSc or BA, followed by a three year clinical course, which in combination with the BSc or BA leads to a full medical degree. The degree awarded is BA at Oxford and Cambridge (which later becomes an MA), and BSc at the others. At these five medical schools, it is sometimes also possible to spend extra optional year(s) where one can study for an intercalated masters or doctoral degree in addition to the BSc/BA which all students receive, for example, the [[University of Cambridge]] offers an MB PhD programme of nine years total duration comprising preclinical training, the intercalated BA (see above), clinical training and within the clinical training period a [[PhD]].

In contrast to the intercalated degrees mentioned above, there also exists a Bachelor of Medical Science degree (BMedSci). Most universities will award the unclassified degree of BMedSci to students who successfully complete their pre-clinical medical education, but who do not go on to complete the full clinical course.  At Nottingham, the unclassified BMedSci degree is awarded to all students after the first three years of their course.  The BMedSci at Nottingham differs from the intercalated degree in that it does not involve an extra year of study.  This unclassified BMedSci should be distinguished from the BMedSci(Hons) which some medical schools offer as an intercalated programme of study, in a similar way to the BSc(Hons) courses offered (eg [[Sheffield University Medical School]] and [[Barts and The London, Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry|Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]]). These BMedSci(Hons) courses are honours programmes, and increase the length of the  course from 5 to 6 years, compared with the unclassified BMedSci offered for early exit from medical school.

Until 2003 a BMedSci degree from Newcastle involved a year of intercalation, with a year-long research project, but Newcastle no longer offers this course.

==Medical student life==
Most UK medical students belong to medical societies, or groups set up within the university's [[students' union]] and run by and for medical students, typically organising social events (such as Balls/Formals or drink-offs against other faculties, Law in particular), sporting events (e.g. the National Association of Medics' Sports, NAMS) and occasionally academic events.

The largest free publication in Europe for medical students is the award-winning [http://www.medical-student.co.uk ''Medical Student Newspaper'']. It is written and produced entirely by medical students and is distributed to the five medical schools of London.

Many students also focus on extracurricular academic activities, for example many UK schools have their own student society dedicated to improving health both within the local area through various action projects and globally, through campaigning and working abroad. [[Medsin]] is a fully student run network of healthcare students and is the UK's member of the [[International Federation of Medical Students' Associations]]. Other societies are dedicated to raising awareness about [http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/career/societies careers in surgery] or other.
