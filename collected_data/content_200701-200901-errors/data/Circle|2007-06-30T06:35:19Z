{{about|the shape and mathematical concept of circle}}

In [[Euclidean geometry]], a '''circle''' is the [[set]] of all [[point (geometry)|points]] in a plane at a fixed [[distance]], called the [[radius]], from a given point, the ''centre''.  

Circles are [[simple closed curve]]s which divide the plane into an interior and exterior.  The ''[[circumference]]'' of a circle means the length of the circle, and the interior of the circle is called a ''[[Disk (mathematics)|disk]]''.  An ''[[Arc (geometry)|arc]]'' is any [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] portion of a circle. 

A circle is a special [[ellipse]] in which the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] coincide (i.e., are the same point).  Circles are [[conic section]]s attained when a right circular cone is intersected with a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone.

=== Equation of a circle ===
In an ''x''-''y'' [[coordinate system]], the circle with centre (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'' is the set of all points (''x'', ''y'') such that

:<math>
\left( x - a \right)^2 + \left( y - b \right)^2=r^2.
</math>

If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then this [[formula]] can be simplified to 

:<math>x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \!\ </math>

and its [[tangent]] will be

:<math>xx_1+yy_1=r^2 \!\ </math>
where <math>x_1</math>, <math>y_1</math> the coordinates of the common point.

When expressed in [[parametric equations]], (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') can be written using the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine as

:<math>x = a+r\,\cos t,\,\!</math>
:<math>y = b+r\,\sin t\,\!</math>

where ''t'' is a [[parametric variable]], understood as the angle the ray to (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') makes with the ''x''-axis. 

In [[homogeneous coordinates]] each [[conic section]] with equation of a circle is

:<math>
ax^2+ay^2+2b_1xz+2b_2yz+cz^2 = 0.
</math>

It can be proven that a ''conic section'' is a circle if and only if the point I(1,i,0) and J(1,-i,0) lie on the conic section. These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].

In [[polar coordinates]] the equation of a circle is

:<math>
r^2 - 2 r r_0 \cos(\theta - \varphi) + r_0^2 = a^2.\,
</math>

In the [[complex plane]], a circle with a centre at ''c'' and radius ''r'' has the equation <math>|z-c|^2 = r^2</math>. Since <math>|z-c|^2 = z\overline{z}-\overline{c}z-c\overline{z}+c\overline{c}</math>, the slightly generalized equation <math>pz\overline{z} + gz + \overline{gz} = q</math> for real ''p'', ''q'' and complex ''g'' is sometimes called a [[generalized circle]]. It is important to note that not all generalized circles are actually circles.

=== Slope ===

The [[slope]] of a circle at a point (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') can be expressed with the following formula, assuming the centre is at the origin and (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') is on the circle:

:<math>
y' = - \frac{x}{y}.
</math>

=== Area enclosed ===

[[Image:Circle_Area.svg|thumb|150px|Area of the circle = '''''π''''' × area of the shaded square]]

{{main|Area of a disk}}

*The [[Area of a disk|area enclosed by a circle]] is

:<math>
A = r^2 \cdot \pi = \frac{d^2\cdot\pi}{4} \approx 0{.}7854 \cdot d^2, </math>

that is, approximately 79% of the circumscribed square.

=== Circumference ===
{{main|circumference}}
*Length of a circle's circumference is

:<math>
c = \pi d = 2\pi \cdot r.
</math>

*Alternate formula for circumference:

Given that the ratio circumference ''c'' to the Area ''A'' is 

:<math>
\frac{c}{A} = \frac{2 \pi r}{\pi r^2}.
</math>

The ''r'' and the &pi; can be canceled, leaving

:<math>
\frac{c}{A} = \frac{2}{r}.
</math>

Therefore solving for ''c'':
 
:<math>
c = \frac{2A}{r}
</math>

So the circumference is equal to 2 times the area, divided by the radius.  This can be used to calculate the circumference when a value for &pi; cannot be computed.

=== Diameter ===
{{main|diameter}}

The diameter of a circle is

:<math>
d = 2r= 2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} \approx 1{.}1284 \cdot \sqrt{A}.
</math>

==Properties==
[[Image:Secant-Secant_Theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Secant-secant theorem]]

*The circle is the shape with the highest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetry]])
*The circle is a highly symmetric shape, every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the centre for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,'''R'''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.
*All circles are [[similarity (mathematics)|similar]].
**A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]], 
**The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]]. 
**The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2[[pi|π]] and π, respectively.
*The circle centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].

=== Chord properties ===
* Chords equidistant from the centre of a circle are equal (length). 
* Equal (length) chords are equidistant from the centre. 
* The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector: 
** A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord. 
** The line segment ([[Circular segment]]) through the centre bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord. 
* If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. 
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal. 
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplemental.
** For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.
* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle.

===Sagitta properties===
*  The sagitta is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the circumference of the circle.
*  Given the length of a chord, '''y''', and the length '''x''' of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle which will fit around the 2 lines :

<math>r=\frac{y^2}{8x}+\frac{x}{2}</math>

===Tangent properties===
*The line drawn perpendicular to the end point of a radius is a tangent to the circle. 
*A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent at the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle. 
*Tangents drawn from a point outside the circle are equal in length. 
*Two tangents can always be drawn from a point outside of the circle.

===Theorems===
{{See also|Power of a point}}
*The chord theorem states that if two chords, CD and EF, intersect at G, then <math>CG \times DG = EG \times FG</math>. (Chord theorem) 
*If a tangent from an external point ''D'' meets the circle at ''C'' and a secant from the external point ''D'' meets the circle at ''G'' and ''E'' respectively, then <math>DC^2 = DG \times DE</math>. (tangent-secant theorem) 
*If two [[secant]]s, DG and DE, also cut the circle at H and F respectively, then <math>DH \times DG = DF \times DE</math>. (Corollary of the tangent-secant theorem) 
*The angle between a tangent and chord is equal to the subtended angle on the opposite side of the chord. (Tangent chord property)
*If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 degrees then ''l'' = √(2)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''r'', where ''l'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.
*If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle A is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (DE and BC). This is the secant-secant theorem.

==Inscribed angles==

[[Image:inscribed_angle_theorem.svg|thumb|242px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]

An [[inscribed angle]] <math>\psi</math> is exactly half of the corresponding [[central angle]] <math>\theta</math> (see Figure).
Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc have the same value
(cf. the blue and green angles <math>\psi</math> in the Figure).  Angles inscribed on the arc are supplementary.
In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] 
is a [[right angle]].

==An alternative definition of a circle==<!-- This section is linked from [[Sphere]] -->

[[Image:Apollonius_circle_definition_labels.svg|thumb|200px|left|<math>\frac{d_1}{d_2}=\textrm{constant}</math> Apollonius' definition of a circle]]

[[Apollonius of Perga]] showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points having a constant ''ratio'' of distances to two foci, A and B.  

The proof is as follows.  A line segment PC bisects the interior angle APB, since the segments are similar:

:<math>
\frac{AP}{BP} = \frac{AC}{BC}
</math>

Analogously, a line segment PD bisects the corresponding exterior angle.  Since the interior and exterior angles sum to <math>180^{\circ}</math>, the angle CPD is exactly <math>90^{\circ}</math>, i.e., a [[right angle]].   The set of points P that form a right angle with a given line segment CD form a circle, of which CD is the diameter.
{{-}}
As a point of clarification, note that C and D are determined by A, B, and the desired ratio; i.e. A and B are not arbitrary points lying on an extension of the diameter of an existing circle.

== Calculating the parameters of a circle ==

[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|225px|Early [[science]], particularly [[geometry]] and [[Astrology and astronomy|astronomy/astrology]], was connected to the divine for most [[History of science in the Middle Ages|medieval scholars]]. 
The [[compass (drafting)|compass]] in this [[13th century]] manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation (theology)|Creation]], as many believed that there was something intrinsically "divine" or "perfect" that could be found in circles]]

Given three non-collinear points lying on the circle

:<math> 
\mathrm{P_1} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{bmatrix}, 
\mathrm{P_2} = \begin{bmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{bmatrix},

</math>

=== Radius ===

The radius of the circle is given by

\mathrm{r} = \frac
{\left|P_1-P_2\right| \left|P_2-P_3\right|\left|P_3-P_1\right|}
{2 \left|\left(P_1-P_2\right) \times \left(P_2-P_3\right)\right|}
</math>

=== Center ===

The center of the circle is given by

:<math> 
\mathrm{P_c} = \alpha \, P_1 + \beta \, P_2 + \gamma \, P_3
</math>

where

:<math>
\alpha = \frac
{\left|P_2-P_3\right|^2 \left(P_1-P_2\right) \cdot \left(P_1-P_3\right)}
{2 \left|\left(P_1-P_2\right) \times \left(P_2-P_3\right)\right|^2}
</math>

:<math>
\beta = \frac
{\left|P_1-P_3\right|^2 \left(P_2-P_1\right) \cdot \left(P_2-P_3\right)}
{2 \left|\left(P_1-P_2\right) \times \left(P_2-P_3\right)\right|^2}
</math>

:<math>
\gamma = \frac
{\left|P_1-P_2\right|^2 \left(P_3-P_1\right) \cdot \left(P_3-P_2\right)}
{2 \left|\left(P_1-P_2\right) \times \left(P_2-P_3\right)\right|^2}
</math>

=== Plane unit normal ===

A unit normal of the plane containing the circle is given by

:<math>
\hat{n} = \frac
    {\left( P_2 - P_1 \right) \times \left(P_3-P_1\right)}
    {\left| \left( P_2 - P_1 \right) \times \left(P_3-P_1\right) \right|}
</math>

=== Parametric Equation ===

Given the radius, <math>\mathrm{r}</math> , center, <math>\mathrm{P_c}</math>, a point on the circle, <math>\mathrm{P_0}</math> and a unit normal of the plane containing the circle, <math>\hat{n}</math>, the parametric equation of the circle starting from the point <math>\mathrm{P_0}</math> and proceeding counterclockwise is given by the following equation:

:<math>
\mathrm{R} \left( s \right) = \mathrm{P_c} + 
\cos \left( \frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{r}} \right) \left( P_0 - P_c \right) + 
\sin \left( \frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{r}} \right) 
\left[ \hat{n} \times \left( P_0 - P_c \right) \right]
</math>
