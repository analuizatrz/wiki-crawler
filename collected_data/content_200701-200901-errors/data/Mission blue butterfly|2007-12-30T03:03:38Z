The '''mission blue butterfly''', ''Icaricia icarioides missionensis'', is a [[Lycaenidae|blue or lycaenid]] [[butterfly]] subspecies that is native to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of the [[United States]]. The butterfly has been declared as ''endangered'' by the [[Federal Government]]. It is sometimes placed in the [[genus]] ''[[Plebejus]]''.

== Description ==
[[Image:Female mission blue.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|The brownish-colored female mission blue butterfly]]
[[Image:Male mission blue.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|The iridescent blue male mission blue butterfly]]
The endangered mission blue is about the size of a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] (21–33&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]) with even smaller larvae which are very rarely seen. Its wingspan is around 1–1½&nbsp;[[inch]]es. The top wing, in mission blue males, is iridescent blue and lavender. The margins of the upper wing are black and sport "long, white, hair-like scales." The male butterfly also has small circular gray spots in the submargins on the ventral surface of the whitish ventral wing surface. In the post-median and submedian areas of the [[ventral]] surface black spots mark the upper and lower wing. The male body is a dark-blue/brown color.<ref name="USFWS">[http://www.fws.gov/sacramento/es/animal_spp_acct/mission_blue_butterfly.htm Mission Blue Butterfly], Species Account, USFWS, Sacramento Office</ref>

The female mission blue have a dark brown upper wing that are marked with blue basal areas. The margins of the wing fringe are very similar to those on the male of the species. The underside of the wing on the female butterfly are gray with a dot pattern that is, again similar to that on the male.<ref name="USFWS"/>

The larvae will only feed on the leaves of the three host lupine plants (''Lupinus albifrons'', ''L. formosus'', and ''L. variicolor'') native to their habitat. The plants are necessary for survival for the mission blue. Thus, the butterfly's fate is closely tied to that of the three species of lupine as the plants provide food and shelter for the butterfly in its larval stage. The adult mission blue drinks the nectar of a variety of flowers, many in the [[Asteraceae|sunflower family]], using its long [[proboscis]] which extends from the underside of its head.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/goga/parklabs/library/wildlifeguide/insects/mb_butterfly.htm Mission Blue Butterfly], Wildlife Field Guide, National Parks Labs</ref>

In the 1983 study "Six Ecological Studies of Endangered Butterflies", R. A. Arnold found that about 35% of eggs collected in the field were being parasitized by an unknown [[Encryrtidae|encryrtid wasp]]. Other parasitic [[Hymenoptera]] have been taken from the eggs of various ''Icarioides'' species. As far as predator-prey relationships, [[rodent]]s are probably the primary predator of both the larvae and pupae.<ref name="Biogeo"/>

==Habitats==
The mission blue depends on a very specific host plant. As such, its habitat is restricted solely to the [[U.S. states|U.S. state]] of California. More specifically, it is limited to a range of five known areas where mission blue colonies have been confirmed. Those areas are subject to a range of conservation and habitat restoration action.

==Range==
''I. i. missionensis'' is federally endangered and found in only a few locations. Its habitat is restricted to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], specifically five areas, the [[Twin Peaks, San Francisco, California|Twin Peaks]] area in [[San Francisco County]], [[Fort Baker]], a former military installation managed by the National Park Service (NPS), in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], the [[San Bruno Mountain]] area in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], the [[Marin Headlands]], in Golden Gate National Recreation Area (another NPS entity) and [[Skyline Ridge]], also in San Mateo County.<ref name="GoldenGate"/> San Bruno Mountain hosts the largest population of mission blues, a butterfly that is commonly found around elevations of 700&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]]. The coastal scrubland and grassland the mission blue requires is found only in and around the [[Golden Gate]] of San Francisco. The butterfly depends solely on three species of perennial lupine for its reproduction, the [[varied lupine]], [[silver lupine]] and the [[Summer lupine]]. The mission blue requires the lupine to lay their eggs and nourish the larvae. Without these species, the mission blue cannot reporduce and thus cannot survive.<ref name="Biogeo"/> Thus, the mission blue's habitat parallels that of the lupine species.

Two of the areas inhabited by the mission blue are within the confines of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Golden Gate staff are working to ease the invasive species problem that has helped reduce the mission blue to the endangered species list. They work to remove non-native plants and replant the area with lupine seed along with continual monitoring of the butterfly and its host plant.<ref name="Fireplan">{{cite book |url=http://www.fireplan.gov/overview/documents/06_ca_nps_gogate_hfr.pdf |title=Restoration after Solstice Fire Reduces Fuel and Improves Grassland Health |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]}}</ref>

Much of the area that the mission blue once inhabited has been destroyed. The coastal scrubland has seen unnatural human development in much of the region. The San Mateo County town of [[Brisbane, California|Brisbane]] lies in what may once have been the prime habitat for the butterfly. Near Brisbane, an industrial park and rock quarry have proved damaging to the mission blue habitat. Generally, the most negative impactor on Mission blue habitat is that of residential and industrial development. Aside from development, other human activities have negatively impacted the butterfly's habitat. Those activities include cultivation and grazing as well as the oft human assisted abundance of invasive exotic species. Some of the more impactful exotics include the [[European gorse]] and [[pompous grass]].<ref name="Biogeo"/> In the Golden Gate Recreation Area, [[thoroughwort]] is a particular invasive species which is taking over habitat once occupied by the mission blue's lifeblood, the three species of lupine.<ref name="Fireplan"/> Of the threats facing the mission blue, habitat loss due to human intervention and exotic, invasive species are the two most critical.

Residential and industrial development continually threaten mission blue habitat, such as the 1997-2001 seismic retrofitting of the Golden Gate Bridge. Despite costing and additional US$1.2 million to comply to environmental standards the construction project still claimed about 1½&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]] of butterfly habitat through "incidental take," an exception provided under California law. Through a type of habitat conservation popular since a 1983 amendment to the [[Endangered Species Act]], the incidental take is offset by off-site mitigation and restoration. In this case, the San Francisco Highway and Transportation District in cooperation with the National Park Service funded a US$450,000 off-site restoration plan. The main aspect of this plan was to establish about 8&nbsp;ha of mision blue habitat in the area of the bridge project.<ref>Giacomini, Mervin C. and Woelfel, John E. [http://www.pubs.asce.org/ceonline/1100feat.html Golden Gate Update], ''Civil Engineering Magazine'', Nov. 2000</ref>

The mission blue butterfly was first collected in the [[Mission District]] of [[San Francisco]] in 1937. Today, there is a small colony on Twin Peaks; the species has also been found in Fort Baker, which is in Marin County. However, the majority of today's Mission blue colonies are found on San Bruno Mountain. Besides those on the mountain, other colonies have been found in San Mateo County. Those colonies have been located at elevations of 690–1,180&nbsp;ft. Some colonies have been found in the "fog belt" of the coastal mountain range. The mission blue colonies in the area prefer coastal [[chaparral]] and coastal [[grassland]]s which are the predominate [[biome]]s where mission blues are found.<ref name="USFWS"/>

==Status==
The mission blue butterfly was added to the Federal Endangered Species List in 1976, its protection falls under the jurisdiction of the federal [[Endangered Species Act]].<ref name="GoldenGate"/> While the state of California has enacted an Endangered Species Act, it is quite specific about what affords its protection. Sec. 2062 of the [[California Endangered Species Act]], under definitions, declares, "Endangered species" means a native species or subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant which is in serious danger of becoming extinct." There is no provision for a state endangered listing in California for any insect. The mission blue butterfly is not protected by state statute in California.<ref>[http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/ceqacesa/cesa/incidental/cesa_policy_law.shtml California Endangered Species Act], CA Dept. of Fish and Game, Habitat Conservation Planning Branch</ref>

==Life cycle==
Each year marks the birth of a new generation of mission blues, as only one generation exists per year. The butterfly lays its eggs on the leaves, buds and seed pods of ''L. albifrons'', ''Lupinus formosus'' and ''Lupinus variicolor''.<ref name="SanBruno">Orsak, Larry J. [http://www.mountainwatch.org/mountain/fauna/missionbluebutterfly.htm Mission Blues], San Bruno Mountain Watch</ref> The eggs are usually laid on the [[dorsum|dorsal]] side of new lupine leaves. Eggs generally hatch within six to ten days and the first and second [[instar]] larvae feed on the [[mesophyll]] of the lupine plants.<ref name="GoldenGate">[http://www.parksconservancy.org/ourwork/communityprograms/sitestewardship/bluebutterfly.php Mission Blue Butterflies], Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy</ref> The [[caterpillar]]s, extremely small, feed for a short time and then crawl to the plant base where they enter a dormant state, known as [[diapause]], until the late winter or the following spring. Diapause usually begins about three weeks after [[eclosion]] and begins about the same time as the host plant shifts its energy to flower and seed production.<ref name="GoldenGate"/> When the caterpillar comes out of its diapause and begins feeding, it occasionally [[ecdysis|sheds its skin]] to accommodate its growth.<ref name="SanBruno"/>

As the [[larva]]e feed and grow, native ants may gather and indicate the presence of larger mission blue larvae. The ants will often stand on the caterpillar and tap it with their antennae. In response, the caterpillar secretes honeydew. The ants eat honeydew and in return it is likely, through this symbiotic relationship, that the ants ward off predators. Once the caterpillar is fully grown, it leaves the larval stage and enters the [[pupa]]l stage of development. The fully grown caterpillar forms a [[Pupa#Chrysalis|chrysalis]] after securing itself to a surface which is generally a lupine stem or leaf. They shed their outer skin, revealing their chrysalid. This stage lasts about ten days while the adult butterfly develops within the chrysalid. The butterfly can be sighted as early as late March in places like the summit of San Bruno Mountain or the Twin Peaks. They persist well into June when they will be seen perched on a [[lupine]] plant or feeding on [[coastal buckwheat]] flowers.<ref name="SanBruno"/> Day to day for the adult butterfly is mostly spent foraging for nectar, flying, mating and for the females, laying eggs. Nearly equal time is spent between perching, feeding and flying.<ref name="Biogeo">[http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/Fall00Projects/MissionBlue.htm The Biogeography of the mission blue butterfly], San Francisco State University, Department of Geography, Autumn 2000</ref> The adult mission blue lives approximately one week; during this time, the females lay the eggs on the host plant. The complete mission blue butterfly life cycle lasts one year.<ref name="GoldenGate"/>

[[Image:summer lupine.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The summer lupine, ''[[Lupinus formosus]]'']]
''See main article [[lupin]]''.

The mission blue butterfly is entirely dependent upon three species in the genus ''Lupinus''.

===''Lupinus albifrons''===
[[Image:Lupine seedling solstice fire site.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A lupine seedling at the site of a 2004 California wildfire]]
''L. albifrons'', or [[silver lupine]], sometimes known as silver bush lupine, is one of the lupine species that acts as the host plant for the larvae and pupae of the mission blue butterfly. It is a small, round shrub, with a woody trunk. A [[deciduous]] [[Perennial plant|perennial]], the plant takes up about 2&nbsp;ft of space and can reach heights of 5&nbsp;ft. It blooms a light blue to violet flower on 3–12&nbsp;in stalks. The leaves are a silver color with a feathery texture. The silver lupine is found along the coasts of Oregon and California, as well as in dry and open meadows, prairies and forest clearings in those states. ''Lupinus albifrons'' is a [[legume]] and thus it has nitrogen-fixing nodules on its roots.<ref>[http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/Spring%2005%20projects/silver_bush_lupine.htm The Biogeography of the silver bush lupine], San Francisco State University</ref>

The silver lupine has five different [[variety (biology)|varieties]], three of which occur only in California, the other two occur in both California and Oregon. The five varieties are: ''Lupinus albifrons'' var. ''albifrons'', silver lupine, ''Lupinus albifrons'' var. ''collinus'', silver lupine, ''Lupinus albifrons'' var. ''douglasii'', Douglas' silver lupine,'' Lupinus albifrons'' var. ''eminens'', silver lupine, and ''Lupinus albifrons'' var. ''flumineus'', silver lupine.<ref>[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=LUAL4 Plant Profile, Silver Lupine], Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture</ref>

===''Lupinus formosus''===
''L. formosus'' has been cited as a poisonous plant. Its common name is [[summer lupine]]. Because of its toxological status it faces eradication at the hands of cattle farmers as it has been implicated in [[crooked calf disease]], though it is not endangered. This lupine, along with five others, is poisonous from the time it starts growth in the spring until the seed pods shatter in late summer or early fall. However, the younger the plant the more toxic it is.<ref>[http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=9950 Lupine], Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture</ref> 

Summer lupine is one of three piperidine alkaloid containing plants that have poisonous effects on livestock. It, along with [[poison hemlock]] (''Conium maculatum'') and [[tree tobacco]] (''Nicotiana glauca''), induced "multiple congenital contractures (MCC) and palatoschisis in goat kids when their dams were gavaged with the plant during gestation." The skeletel abnormalities included fixed extension of the [[carpal]], [[tarsal]] and [[fetlock]] joints, [[scoliosis]], [[lordosis]], [[torticollis]] and rib cage problems. The clinical signs of toxicity in sheep, cattle and pigs included, [[ataxia]], incoordination, muscular weakness, [[prostration]] and death.<ref> [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=2089736&dopt=Abstract Abstract (multiple authors)] "Congenital skeletal malformations and cleft palate induced in goats by ingestion of ''Lupinus'', ''Conium'' and ''Nicotiana'' species", USDA/ARS/Poisonous Plant Research Laboratory, Logan, UT</ref>

The summer lupine is part of the [[Fabaceae]] family. It inhabits areas of dry slopes beneath pine trees, clay soils, grasslands, [[coniferous]] forests, and areas in the [[San Jacinto Mountains|San Jacinto]], [[Santa Rosa Mountains|Santa Rosa]] and [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. This lupine blooms from April to August.<ref>[http://www.calflora.net/bloomingplants/summerlupine.html ''Lupinus formosus''], Calflora Database</ref>

===''Lupinus variicolor''===
''L. variicolor'' is known by several common names including varied lupine, manycolored lupine, Lindley's varied lupine and varicolored lupine. Its range is restricted to the northern coastal scrub and coastal prairie in the U.S. state of California. It thrives in elevations between 0 and 1,640&nbsp;ft. Another member of the Fabaceae family, it is a shrub. ''L. variicolor'' is endemic and native to only the U.S. state of California where it occurs mostly along the northern coast, though it has been reported in [[Sutter County, California]].<ref>[http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Lupinus+variicolor ''Lupinus variicolor''], Calflora Database</ref>

==Other information==
===Evolution===
{{main article|Butterfly evolution}}
The Theolinae evolved in a tropical climate while the Lycaenidae and ''Icaricia'' evolved in a temperate climate zone. The genus ''Icaricia'' comprises 12 species. They are, ''I. icarioides'', ''I. evius'', ''I. moroensis'', ''I. missionensis'', ''I. padalis'', ''I. pheres'', ''I. ardea'', ''I. lycea'', ''I. bucholzi'', ''I. pembina'', ''I. blackmorei'', and ''I. montis''.<ref name="Biogeo"/> The genus ''Icaricia'' was introduced in a 1944 paper by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]. The paper, Notes on the morphology of the genus Lycæides (Lycænidæ, Lepidoptera), was published in the Sep.-Dec. issue of ''Psyche—A Journal of Entomology'' and described two new genera, ''Icaricia'' and ''[[Plebulina]]''.<ref>[http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/dzbutt10.htm Excerpts from]: Zimmer, Deiter E. ''A Guide to Nabokov's Butterflies and Moths'', Penn State University Libraries</ref>

===Taxonomy===
Its trinomial name is ''Icaricia icarioides missionensis'', however the species used to be classified as a subspecies in the genus ''Plebejus'' (''Pelbius''). The mission blue is classified as a subspecies of [[Boisduval's blue]] (formerly ''Plebejus'' (''Plebius'') ''icarioides'', now ''Icaricia icarioides''), the nomenclature for the mission blue as late as 2000 was ''Plebejus'' (''Plebius'') ''icarioides missionensis''.<ref>[http://www.naba.org/images/lycaenidae/lycaenidae.html Family Lycaenidae], North American Butterfly Association</ref> It is still a subspecies of Boisduval's blue.
  	     
==Habitat conservation==
{{main article|Mission blue butterfly habitat conservation}}
The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) has a number of habitat conservation programs in effect which includes lands traditionally inhabited by the mission blue butterfly. A recovery plan, drawn up by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984, outlined the need to protect mission blue habitat and to repair habitat damaged by urbanization, off highway vehicle traffic, and invasion by exotic, non-native plants.<ref name="Biogeo"/> An example of the type of work being done by governmental and citizen agencies can be found in the Marin Headlands at [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]. In addition, regular wildfires have opened new habitat conservation opportunities as well as damaging existing ones.
