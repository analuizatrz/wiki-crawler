'''Arsenal Football Club ''' (also known as '''Arsenal''', '''The Arsenal''' or '''The Gunners''') are an English professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], [[North London]]. They play in the [[Premier League]] and are one of the [[Football records in England#Most successful clubs overall (1888 - present)|most successful clubs]] in [[Football in England|English football]], having won thirteen [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and Premier League titles and ten [[FA Cup]]s, and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the English top flight.

Arsenal were founded in 1886 and were the first [[South of England|Southern]] club to join the [[Football League]], in 1893. They won their first major trophies in the 1930s, with five League Championship titles and two FA Cups. After a lean period in the post-war years they became the second club of the 20th century to win the [[the Double|League and FA Cup Double]] in [[1970-71 in English football|1970–71]], and during the past twenty years have recorded a series of successes – in this time Arsenal have won a [[The Double#Domestic Cup Double|Cup Double]], two further League and FA Cup Doubles, the Premier League title [[The Invincibles (football)|unbeaten]], and became the first [[Football in London|London club]] to reach the [[UEFA Champions League]] [[UEFA Champions League Final 2006|Final]].

The club's colours have traditionally been red and white, although these have evolved through history. Similarly, the club have changed location over time; the team were initially founded in [[Woolwich]], south-east [[London]], but in 1913 they moved north across the city to [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]. In 2006 they made a less drastic move to their current home, the [[Emirates Stadium]] in nearby [[Holloway, London|Holloway]].

Arsenal have a large fanbase, who hold a string of long-standing rivalries with several other clubs; the most notable of these is with neighbours [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with whom they regularly contest the [[North London derby]]. Arsenal are one of the richest clubs in English football (valued at over £600m as of 2008), and thanks to their stature, have regularly featured in portrayals of football in [[British culture]]. [[Arsenal L.F.C.|Arsenal Ladies]] are the most successful English club in [[women's football (soccer)|women's football]] and are also affiliated with the club.

In 1925, Arsenal appointed [[Herbert Chapman]] as manager. Chapman had already won the league twice with [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in [[1923-24 in English football|1923–24]] and [[1924-25 in English football|1924–25]], and he brought Arsenal their first period of major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings of star players such as [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]] and [[Cliff Bastin]], laid the foundations of the club's domination of English football in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book | author=Soar & Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | pages=p.18 }}</ref> Under his guidance Arsenal won their first major trophies – an FA Cup in [[1929-30 in English football|1929–30]] and two League Championships, in [[1930-31 in English football|1930–31]] and [[1932-33 in English football|1932–33]]. In addition, Chapman was reportedly behind the 1932 renaming of the local [[London Underground]] station from "Gillespie Road" to "[[Arsenal tube station|Arsenal]]", making it the only Tube station to be named specifically after a football club.<ref>{{cite web |  url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3709.aspx | title=London Underground and Arsenal present The Final Salute to Highbury | publisher=Transport for London | date=[[2006-01-12]] | accessdate=2008-08-11 }}</ref>

Chapman died suddenly of [[pneumonia]] in early 1934, but [[Joe Shaw (footballer born 1883)|Joe Shaw]] and [[George Allison]] carried on his successful work. Under their guidance, Arsenal won three more titles ([[1933-34 in English football|1933–34]], [[1934-35 in English football|1934–35]] and [[1937-38 in English football|1937–38]]) and an FA Cup ([[1935-36 in English football|1935–36]]). However Arsenal had started to fade by the decade's end, when the intervention of [[World War II]] meant competitive professional football in England was suspended.

After the war, under Allison's successor [[Tom Whittaker (footballer)|Tom Whittaker]], Arsenal enjoyed a second period of success, winning the league in [[1947-48 in English football|1947–48]] and [[1952-53 in English football|1952–53]], and the FA Cup in [[1949-50 in English football|1949–50]]. However, after that their fortunes waned; unable to attract players of the same calibre as they had in the 1930s, the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in trophyless mediocrity. Even former [[England national football team|England]] captain [[Billy Wright (footballer)|Billy Wright]] could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.

Arsenal began winning silverware again with the surprise appointment of club [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] [[Bertie Mee]] as manager in 1966. After losing two [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] finals, they won the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], their first European trophy, in [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1969-70|1969–70]]. This was followed by an even greater triumph: their first League and FA Cup [[the Double|double]] in [[1970-71 in English football|1970–71]]. However, the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses. Arsenal finished as First Division runners-up in [[1972-73 in English football|1972–73]], lost three FA Cup finals ([[1971-72 in English football|1971–72]], [[1977-78 in English football|1977–78]] and [[1979-80 in English football|1979–80]]) and lost the 1979–80 [[Cup Winners' Cup]] final on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalties]]. The club's only success during this time was an FA Cup win in [[1978-79 in English football|1978–79]], with a last-minute 3–2 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] that is widely regarded as a classic.<ref>A 2005 poll of English football fans rated the 1979 FA Cup Final the 15th greatest game of all time.

The return of former player [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory. Arsenal won the League Cup in [[1986-87 in English football|1986–87]], Graham's first season in charge. This was followed by a League title win in [[1988-89 in English football|1988–89]], won with a last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Graham's Arsenal won another title in [[1990-91 in English football|1990–91]], losing only one match, the FA Cup and League Cup double in [[1992-93 in English football|1992–93]] and a second European trophy, the [[Cup Winners' Cup]], in [[1993-94 in English football|1993–94]]. However, Graham's reputation was tarnished when it was revealed that he had taken kickbacks from agent [[Rune Hauge]] for signing certain players,<ref>Graham was banned for a year by the Football Association for his involvement in the scandal after he admitted he had received an "unsolicited gift" from Hauge.

The club's success in the late 1990s and 2000s owes a great deal to the appointment of manager [[Arsène Wenger]] in 1996.

Arsenal won a second league and cup double in [[1997-98 in English football|1997–98]] and a third in [[2001-02 in English football|2001–02]]. In addition, the club reached the final of the [[UEFA Cup 1999-00|1999–00]] [[UEFA Cup]] (losing on penalties to [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]]), were victorious in the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03]] and [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]] FA Cups, and won the Premier League in [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] without losing a single match, which earned the side the nickname "[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]";<ref name="invincibles">{{cite news

[[Image:Arsenal fc old crest small.png|thumb|160px|A version of the Arsenal crest used from 1949 to 2002.]]
Royal Arsenal's first crest, unveiled in 1888, featured three [[cannon]]s viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]]. These can sometimes be mistaken for [[chimney]]s, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a [[wikt:cascabel|cascabel]] on each are clear indicators that they are cannon.<ref name="crest">{{cite web |

}}</ref> This was dropped after the moved to Highbury in 1913, but in 1922, the club adopted their first single-cannon crest, featuring an eastward-pointing cannon, with the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.<ref name="crest"/> In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon, the club's name set in [[blackletter]] above the cannon, the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted [[Latin]] [[motto]], ''Victoria Concordia Crescit'' (meaning "victory comes from harmony"), coined by Harry Homer, the club's programme editor.<ref name="crest"/> For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green.

Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to [[copyright]] it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a [[trademark]], and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold 'unofficial' Arsenal merchandise,<ref>{{cite web

For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.<ref name="soartyler23"/> The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and blue socks.<ref name="historicalkits">{{cite web |

In 1933 Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter [[pillar box]] red. The origin of the white sleeves is not conclusively known, but two possible inspirations have been put forward. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the [[cartoonist]] [[Tom Webster (cartoonist)|Tom Webster]], with whom Chapman played [[golf]].<ref name="kitdesign">{{cite web |

The first was [[1966-67 in English football|1966–67]], when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;<ref name="historicalkits" /> this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season.

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, [[AC Sparta Praha|Sparta Prague]] adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;<ref name="kitdesign"/> in 1938, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.<ref>{{cite web |

For the majority of their time in south-east London, Arsenal played at the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]] in [[Plumstead]], a three-year period at the nearby [[Invicta Ground]] between 1890 and 1893 excepted. The Manor Ground was initially just a field, but the club installed stands and terracing in time for their first Football League match in September 1893. They played their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in [[1894-95 in English football|1894–95]]), until the move to north London in 1913.

[[Arsenal Stadium]], widely referred to as Highbury, was Arsenal's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of [[stadium|terracing]].<ref name="conservation_plan">{{cite web | url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/DownloadableDocuments/Environment/Pdf/highburyconservationplan_2005.pdf |

At its peak, Highbury could hold over 60,000 spectators, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and [[Premier League]] regulations forced Arsenal to convert Highbury into an all-seater in time for the [[1993-94 in English football|1993–94]] season, reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.<ref>{{cite web

Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. There is also the [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]], which promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Highbury High'', ''Gunflash'' and the less cerebral ''Up The Arse!''. In addition to the usual English [[football chant]]s, Arsenal's supporters sing "One-Nil to the Arsenal" (to the tune of "[[Go West (song)|Go West]]") and "Boring, Boring Arsenal", which used to be a common taunt from opposition fans but is now sung ironically by Arsenal supporters when the team is playing well.<ref name="noble">{{cite news |

They went a record total stretch of 995 minutes without letting an opponent score; the streak finally ended in the final against [[FC Barcelona]], when [[Samuel Eto'o]] scored Barcelona's equaliser in the 76th minute.<ref name="2006ucl">{{cite news|
