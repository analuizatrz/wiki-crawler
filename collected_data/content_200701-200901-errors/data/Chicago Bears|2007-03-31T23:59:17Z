The '''Chicago Bears''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. They are members of the [[NFC North|North Division]] of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and are the current [[List of NFC Championship Game winners|National Football Conference Champions]]. The Bears have won nine [[National Football League championships history|Professional American Football league championships]] (eight [[List of NFL champions|NFL Championships]] and [[Super Bowl XX]]), trailing only the [[Green Bay Packers]], who have twelve. The Bears have the most enshrinees in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] with 26 members.

The club was founded in [[Decatur, Illinois]], in 1919 and moved to Chicago in 1921. The team played home games at [[Wrigley Field]] on Chicago's North Side through the 1970 season. With the exception of the 2002 season, they have played their home games at Chicago's [[Soldier Field]] every year since 1971. The stadium is located next to [[Lake Michigan]] and was recently remodeled in a modernization that has attempted to bring stadium amenities expected by today's fans to a historic Chicago building. The team has a fierce, long-standing rivalry with the Packers, whom they have played in over 170 games.

==History==
{{main|History of the Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears seasons}}
===1920–1970===
Originally named the '''Decatur Staleys''', the club was established by the [[A. E. Staley]] Company of [[Decatur, Illinois]] in 1919 as a company team. This was the typical start for several of the early professional football franchises. The company hired [[George Halas]] and [[Edward Sternaman|Edward "Dutch" Sternaman]] in 1920 to run the team, and turned full control of the team over to them in 1921.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Decatur Staleys | work = Local Website | url = http://home.comcast.net/~esterneman/sternaman/football.htm | accessdate =  15 June | accessyear = 2006 }} Information on Dutch Sternaman</ref> However, official team and league records cite Halas as the founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.<ref>{{cite web | title = George Halas: Hall of Fame Member | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=85 | accessdate =  14 May | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

Along with the [[Arizona Cardinals]], the Bears are one of only two charter members of the NFL still in existence. The team relocated to Chicago in 1921, where the club was renamed the '''Chicago Staleys'''. Under an agreement that was reached by Halas and Sternaman with Staley, Halas purchased the rights to the club from Staley for [[United States dollar|US$]]100.

The Bears dominated the league in the early years. Their rivalry with the Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rivalry from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles (see [[History of the Chicago Bears]]). During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the [[Canton Bulldogs]] (who took two league titles over that span) and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4&ndash;4&ndash;2 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. Over that span, the Bears posted an incredible 34 shutouts.

The Bears' rivalry with the [[Green Bay Packers]] is one of the oldest, fiercest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921. In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent them signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bears-Packers: Love-Hate Relationship | work = Packers.com | url = http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ | accessdate =  28 September | accessyear = 2000 }}</ref>

In 1922, Halas changed the team name from the Staleys to the Bears. The team moved into [[Wrigley Field]], which was home to the [[Chicago Cubs]] [[baseball]] franchise. As with several early NFL franchises, the Bears derived their nickname from their city's baseball team. Halas liked the bright orange-and-blue colors of his alma mater, the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], and the Bears adopted those colors as their own, albeit in a darker shade of each (the blue is a Navy Blue, and the orange is [[Pantone]] 1665, similar to burnt orange).

[[Image:Bears 1924.jpg|left|thumb|225px|The 1924 team photo]]The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in [[1921 NFL season|1921]] and remaining competitive throughout the decade. In 1924 the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the [[Cleveland Bulldogs]] on [[December 7]], even putting the title "World's Champions" on their 1924 team photo. But the NFL had ruled that games after [[November 30]] did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland.<ref>{{cite web |title =1924: THE THIRD TIME IS CHARMED |work = PFRA 
  | publisher =  | date =  | url =http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=1924b | accessdate = 2007-02-07}}</ref> Their only losing season came in [[1929 NFL season|1929]].

During the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL's long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college's senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears' aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player [[Red Grange]] within a day of his final game as a collegian.<ref>{{cite web | title = Galloping Ghost scared opponents | work = ESPN.com | url = http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014213.html | accessdate =  1 December | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref>

After the financial losses of the [[1932 NFL season|1932]] Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|1932 "Unofficial" NFL Championship]], the Bears defeated the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] in the first indoor American football game at [[Chicago Stadium]].

The success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game. In the very first [[History of NFL Championships|NFL Championship]], the Bears played against the [[New York Giants]], defeating them 23&ndash;21. The teams met again in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1934|1934 NFL Championship]] where the Giants, wearing sneakers<ref>See [[NFL Championship Game, 1934]] for more information on how the Giants wore sneakers and defeated the Bears</ref> defeated the Bears 30&ndash;13 on a cold, icy day at the [[Polo Grounds]].

[[Image:1946Bears.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The 1946 NFL Championship team photo]]From 1940&ndash;1947, [[quarterback]] [[Sid Luckman]] led the Bears to victories in four out of the five NFL Championship Games in which they appeared. The team acquired the [[University of Chicago]]'s discarded nickname "[[Monsters of the Midway]]" and their now-famous helmet "C", as well as a newly-penned [[Bear Down, Chicago Bears|theme song]] that declared them "The Pride and Joy of Illinois". One famous victory during that period was their 73&ndash;0 victory over the favored [[Washington Redskins]] at [[Griffith Stadium]] in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1940|1940 NFL Championship Game]]; the score is still an NFL record for lopsided results.<ref>{{cite web | title = General History — Chronology (1940 to 1959) | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/chronology/1940-1959.jsp | accessdate =  1 January|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> The secret behind the one-sided outcome was the introduction of a new offensive formation by Halas. The [[T-formation]], as Halas named it, involved two [[running back]]s instead of the traditional one in the backfield. Luckman's success at the quarterback position for the Bears has not been matched, as he still holds club records for passing.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sid Luckman  | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=135| accessdate =  12 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

After declining throughout the 1950s, the team rebounded in [[1963 NFL season|1963]] to capture their 8th NFL Championship, which would be their last until 1985. The late 1960s and early 1970s produced notable players like [[Dick Butkus]], [[Gale Sayers]], and [[Brian Piccolo]], who died of [[Embryonal carcinoma]] in 1969. The American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled ''[[Brian's Song]]'', starring [[James Caan]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; [[Jack Warden]] won an [[Emmy Award]] for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television.

Halas retired as coach in 1967 and spent the rest of his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved with the NFL in the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]'s first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 merger between the NFL and the [[American Football League]], the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the [[National Football Conference]], a position that he held until his death in 1983. In his honor, the NFL named the [[National Football Conference]] Championship trophy as the [[NFC Championship|George Halas Memorial Trophy]].

===1970–present===
After the merger, the Bears finished the 1970 season with a last-place finish in the division, a repeat of their placing in the 1969 season. In 1975 the Bears [[1975 NFL Draft|drafted]] [[Walter Payton]] from [[Jackson State University]] with their first pick, and he made an immediate impact on the football landscape. He won the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player Award]] in the [[1977 NFL season|1977–78 season]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Walter Payton's Statistics | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=174 | accessdate =  3 June | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Remembering Walter Payton | work = Daily Herald | url = http://www.dailyherald.com/special/payton/timeline.htm| accessdate =  11 June|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> Payton would go on to eclipse [[Jim Brown]]'s NFL career [[rush (American football)|rushing]] record in 1984 before retiring in 1987, and would hold the mark until [[2002 NFL season|2002]], when [[Emmitt Smith]] of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] surpassed it.<ref>{{cite web | title = Smith passes Payton as NFL's career rushing leader  | work = Sports Illustrated | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/10/27/smith_record_ap/| accessdate =  16 June | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> Payton's career and great personality would capture the hearts of Bear fans, who called him "Sweetness". He died from a rare liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 45.

From 1977 through 1985 the club's official cheerleaders were the Honey Bears, who were hired by then General Manager [[Jim Finks]]. They cheered at Soldier Field during all Bears home games and performed at [[halftime show|halftime]] for the viewing public. The group's founder and choreographer, Cathy Core, was contacted by Finks on the topic of organizing the cheerleading squad, but as she didn't believe that Finks was actually calling she hung up. When she later found out the call was genuine, she apologized.<ref name="Honey Bears">{{cite web | title = The Honey Bears and Chicago Bears Mascots | work = Bearshistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx | accessdate =  1 May | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

The idea of a cheerleading squad was thought up by Halas himself, who called them "dancing girls".<ref name="Honey Bears" /> Halas was quoted as saying that the Honey Bears would be around as long as he was alive.<ref name="Honey Bears" /> After his death in 1983, his heirs in the McCaskey family decided to end their relationship with the Honey Bears, declining to renew their contract following the Bears' championship season of [[1985 NFL season|1985]]. Word has it that as long as the McCaskey family owns the team, the Honey Bears will remain a memory.<ref name="Honey Bears" />

On [[November 1]] [[1983]], a day after the death of George Halas, his oldest daughter, Virginia McCaskey, took over as the majority owner of the team. Her husband, Ed McCaskey, succeeded her father as the Chairman of the Board.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ed McCaskey | work = Cook County Clerk| url =  http://www.cookctyclerk.com/html/041503resdoc.htm | accessdate = 13 December | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> Their son Michael became the third president in team history.<ref>{{cite web | title = Mike McCaskey | work = ChicagoBears Official Website| url = http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/history_80s.asp | accessdate = 13 December | accessyear = 2006 }} </ref> Mrs. McCaskey holds the honorary title of "secretary of the board of directors", but the 82&ndash;year&ndash;old [[matriarch]] has been called the glue that holds the franchise together.<ref>{{cite web | title = McCaskey | work = Cranes Chicago Business| url = http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/mag/article.pl?article_id=24665 | accessdate =  12 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> Mrs. McCaskey's reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned, as her father originally earmarked her brother, [[George Halas, Jr.|George "Mugs" Halas, Jr.]] as the heir apparent to the franchise. However, he died of a massive heart attack in 1979, and four years later she inherited the team upon George Halas' death. Her impact on the team is well-noted as her own family has dubbed her "The First Lady of Sports", and the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' has listed her as one of Chicago's most powerful women.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chicago's Most Powerful Women | work = Chicago Sun-Times| url = http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/powerful_women/sports_mccaskey.html | accessdate =  16 April | accessyear = 2004 }}</ref>

[[Image:Superbowlshuffle.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The Chicago Bears Shuffling Crew]]
[[Mike Ditka]], a [[tight end]] for the Bears from 1961 to 1966, was hired to coach the team in 1982. In the 1985 season the fire in the Bears&ndash;Packers rivalry was relit when Ditka used 350&ndash;plus pound [[American football positions#Offense|lineman]] [[William Perry (football)|"Refrigerator" Perry]] as a truly [[wide receiver|"wide" receiver]] in a [[touchdown]] play at [[Lambeau Field]], flagrantly taunting the Packers. The Packers have also one-upped the Bears from time to time over the years, such as the "[[instant replay|Instant Replay]] Loss" game of 1989,<ref>{{cite web | title = Bears, Packers have love-hate relationship | work = NFL Insider | url = http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/CHI/4639335 | accessdate =  1 December|accessyear = 2005 }}</ref> and since quarterback [[Brett Favre]] has led the Packers the club has won the last 21 out of 33 meetings with the Bears.<ref>{{cite web | title = Packers vs Bears All-Time Series Results | work = Packers.com | url = http://www.packers.com/history/record_book/results_and_rosters/all_time_results_by_season/?mopponent=contains&opponent=Bears | accessdate =  14 December | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the [[AFL-NFL merger]], in [[Super Bowl XX]] after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary [[46 defense]] and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song "[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]". The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the "unlucky 13th" game of the season, a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] affair in which they were defeated by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. At the time, much was made of the fact that the [[1972 NFL season|1972]] Dolphins are the only franchise in history (through the 2006 season) to have an undefeated season and post-season. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the [[New England Patriots]] in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC title game]]. "The Super Bowl Shuffle" was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.

After the 1985 Championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the [[Super Bowl]] under Mike Ditka. Since the firing of Ditka at the end of the 1992 season, the Bears have only made the playoffs five times&ndash;winning only two games. The club has also gone through three coaching changes since 1993. [[Dave Wannstedt]] was the head coach from 1993 through 1998. [[Dick Jauron]] succeeded Wannstedt after the 1998 season. After having his contract extended through 2004 after the Bears went 13-3 in 2001, Jauron was fired at the end of the 2003 season. Before the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, [[Dave McGinnis]] ([[Arizona Cardinals|Arizona]]'s defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position. The Bears scheduled a press conference to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms.<ref>{{cite web | title = Dave McGinnis | work = Bears History | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/seasons/1999chicagobears.aspx | accessdate =  13 December|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> Incidentally, soon after Jauron's hiring, Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president, replacing him with [[Ted Phillips]] and promoting Michael to [[chairman of the board]]. McCaskey's reign as president has been viewed as a disaster with mishap after mishap.<ref>{{cite web | title = Michael McCaskey | work = Cranes Chicago Business| url = http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/mag/article.pl?article_id=24665 | accessdate =  12 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> Phillips, the current Bears president, became the first man outside of the Halas-McCaskey family to run the team.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ted Phillips | work = Chicago Bears.com | url = http://www.chicagobears.com/team/frontofficeBio.jsp?id=29 | accessdate =  12 July|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

[[Lovie Smith]], hired by the franchise on [[January 15]] [[2004]], is the third and current (as of 2006) post-Ditka head coach. Joining the Bears as a rookie head coach, Smith brought the highly successful [[Tampa 2]] defensive scheme with him to Chicago. Before his second season with the Bears, they rehired their former offensive coordinator and then [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Illinois]] head coach [[Ron Turner]] to improve the Bears' struggling offense.<ref>{{cite web | title = About the Chicago Bears  | work = Vividseats.com | url = http://www.vividseats.com/nfl/chicago-bears-tickets.html | accessdate =  16 October|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> In [[2005 NFL season|2005]], the Bears won their division and reached the [[NFL playoffs, 2005-06|playoffs]] for the first time in four years. Their previous playoff berth was earned by winning the NFC Central in [[2001 NFL season|2001]]. The Bears improved upon their success the following season, by clinching their second consecutive NFC North title during week thirteen of the [[2006 NFL season|2006]] season, winning their first playoff game since 1995, and earning a trip to [[Super Bowl XLI]].<ref>{{cite web | title=GameCenter: Recap — Superbowl.com | work=Superbowl.com | url=http://www.superbowl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20070121_NO@CHI | accessdate = 21 January | accessyear = 2007 }}</ref> However, they fell short of the championship, losing 29-17 to the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. The club has decided to give Lovie Smith a contract extension. The club has offered him a 3-year, $12 million dollar contract to last through 2011. This comes a season after being the lowest paid head coach in the national football league. <ref> http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2783609 </ref> 

The club has played in over a thousand games since becoming a charter member of the NFL in [[1920 NFL season|1920]]. Through the 2006 season, they lead the NFL in overall franchise wins with 686 and have an overall record of 686&ndash;499&ndash;42 (going 670&ndash;482&ndash;42 during the regular season and 16&ndash;17 in the playoffs).<ref>{{cite web | title = All-Time Chicago Bears Record | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=6 | accessdate =  15 June | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

===Ownership===
Virginia McCaskey, her children, and grandchildren control 80% of the team, and Mrs. McCaskey votes her children's stock as well as her own. Patrick Ryan, executive chairman of [[Aon Corporation|Aon Corp.]], and Aon director [[Andrew McKenna]] own 19.7% of the club.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bears Minority Owners | work = Cranes Chicago Business| url = http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/mag/article.pl?article_id=24665 | accessdate =  12 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> Many Bears fans have expressed their displeasure with the McCaskey family. In a ''[[Crain's Chicago Business]]'' article, one businessman described his wishes for the team to maximize its potential.

==Team colors and mascots==
{{main|Chicago Bears Logos, Uniforms, and Mascots}}
===Logo===
The club has had few official logos throughout their history. The first was introduced in the early 1950s as a black bear on top of a football. The team kept this until 1962, when the Bears trademark 'C' logo was first introduced by the team.<ref>{{cite web | title = History of the Chicago Bears Logo | work = Chicago Bears | url = http://www.chicagobears.com/history/uniform.jsp | accessdate =  1 August | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref>
[[Image:ChicagoBears1962.png|right|thumb|150px|One of the original logos (1962-1973)]]
The change in their logo from the black bear was due to the addition of logos on [[football helmet|helmets]], which pro football teams started adding in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Unlike some NFL franchises that have had many different looks over time, the Bears have kept the wishbone 'C' for over 40 years.

In 1974, the team decided to keep the same white 'C' logo but to change the color of it from white to orange with a white trim. This is the current logo to this date; however, the club has experimented with some alternative logos throughout the past decade, including a black bear inside of the orange wishbone 'C', introduced in 1995, and an orange bear head, introduced in 1999.

===Uniforms===

[[Image:Chicago92.gif|thumb|right|The traditional home and away uniform kit for the club]]

In 1920 the team introduced the official team uniforms containing brown and blue stripes. In the 1930s, the franchise's team uniform underwent some substantial alterations. After many subtle and not-so-subtle changes, by 1933 the Bears donned all-orange jerseys with navy numbers and matching black helmets. In 1936, they modified this design into "an early version of [[psychedelic art|psychedelia]]" by adding three orange stripes to their helmets, changing the color of the jerseys from orange to white, complementing the new white jerseys with fourteen navy and orange alternating stripes on the sleeves, and introducing socks with a similar striped pattern extending from ankle to knee. Due to poor response from the fans and the media, this design lasted only one season.<ref>{{cite web | title = History of the Chicago Bears Uniform | work = Chicago Bears | url = http://org-www.chicagobears.com/history/uniform.jsp | accessdate =  1 August | accessyear = 2005 }}<br></ref>

[[Image:NFLClock-Bears-Large.jpg|thumb|left|Chicago Bears Uniform History (1920-2005)]]
By 1949, the team was wearing the familiar navy blue shirts with white, rounded numbers. In 1956, the team added "TV numbers" to the sleeves. The Bears 'C' logo first appeared on the helmets in 1962. The logo changed from white to a white-bordered orange logo eleven years later, and has remained unchanged ever since. The Bears added the initials ''GSH'' to the left sleeve of their jerseys in 1984 in memory of George Halas.

Other variations to the Bears uniforms over the years include the addition of navy blue pants as a part of the road kit in 1984. During the 1994 season, the Bears &ndash; with most of the other NFL franchises &ndash; introduced [[throwback uniform]]s to be worn in the honor of the NFL's 75th Anniversary. These uniforms with brown and blue stripes resemble the original uniforms worn by the team in the 1920s. On [[October 7]] [[2002]] the Bears wore navy blue pants with their navy blue home jerseys for the first time, and lost at home to Green Bay before a national Monday Night Football audience. The Bears did not wear the all-blue combination again until the 2006 regular season finale against the Packers, also a loss, on [[December 31]].

Also, the Bears wore all-white uniforms during their final two road games in the 2006 season. On [[November 13]] [[2005]] and [[October 29]] [[2006]] (both times in games against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]), the Bears introduced an orange alternate home jersey. The orange swaps roles with the navy blue on this alternate jersey, as it becomes the dominant color while the navy complements. The Bears previously wore orange jerseys as part of a throwback uniform in a [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]] game at the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in 2004. The classic look of the club's uniforms has given it the title of one of the best uniform kits in the league.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jay Mohr: Breaking down the best and worst NFL uniforms | work = Sports Illustrated | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/jay_mohr/11/09/mohr.sports/ | accessdate =  9 November | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref>

===Mascots===
Before the introduction of [[Staley Da Bear]], the club had two unofficial mascots named "Rocky" and "Bearman". "Rocky" was a man who donned a "1" Bears jersey, carried a [[megaphone]], and started chants all over Soldier Field during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. There is no known source of who "Rocky" was, except that he disappeared from Soldier Field in the early 1990s and presumably lived in [[Northwest Indiana]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Rocky | work = Bearshistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx | accessdate = 3 May|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> Don Wachter, also known as "Bearman", is a [[season ticket]] holder who decided in 1995 that he could also assist the team by cheerleading. The club allowed him to run across the field with a large Bears flag during player introductions and each team score. In 1996, he donned his "costume" of face paint, bear head and arms, and a number 46 jersey. "Bearman" was forced to stop wearing his costume with the introduction of [[Staley Da Bear]] in 2003; however, in 2005 Wachter was allowed in costume again.<ref>{{cite web | title = "Bearman" | work = Bearshistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx | accessdate =  1 May | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

==Stadium==
[[Image:SoliderFieldAug2004.jpg|right|thumb|Soldier Field II]]
[[Soldier Field]], located on [[Lake Shore Drive]] in Chicago, is the current home to the Bears. The Bears moved into Soldier Field in 1971 after [[Wrigley Field]], the Bears' home for 50 years, became too small to hold an NFL event.<ref name="Wrigley Field">After the [[AFL-NFL Merger]], the newly merged league wanted their teams to play in stadiums that could hold at least 50,000 fans. Even with the portable bleachers that the team brought into Wrigley, the stadium could still only hold 46,000.{{cite web | title = Soldier Field History | work = BearsHistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/soldierfieldhistory.aspx | accessdate =  16 July|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> The stadium's playing turf was changed from [[AstroTurf|astroturf]] to natural grass in time for the start of the 1988 season. The stadium was the site of the infamous [[Fog Bowl (American football)|Fog Bowl]] playoff game between the Bears and [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Flashback: Eagles fly into fog| work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/7730971| accessdate =  28 September| accessyear = 2004 }}</ref>

In 2002, the stadium was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall of the stadium being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, [[January 20]] [[2002]], a day after the Bears lost in the [[NFL playoffs, 2001-02|playoffs]]. It reopened on [[September 27]] [[2003]] after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium's history).<ref>{{cite web | title = Soldier Field History | work = Bears History.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/soldierfieldhistory.aspx | accessdate =  16 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> Many fans refer to the rebuilt stadium as '''New Soldier Field'''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Soldier Field History | work = ChicagoBears.com | url = http://www.chicagobears.com/history/sf_facts.jsp | accessdate =  16 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> During the [[2002 NFL season|2002]] season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois' [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], where they went 3-5.

Many critics have negative views of the new stadium. They believe that its current structure has made it more of an eyesore than a landmark; some have dubbed it the "Mistake on the Lake".<ref>{{cite web | title = Mistake on the Lake | work = The Times of Northwest Indiana | url = http://www.thetimesonline.com/articles/2003/09/30/news/top_news/965adf222a1ac3af86256db100030920.prt | accessdate =  1 September | accessyear = 2003 }}</ref> Soldier Field was stripped of its [[National Historic Landmark]] designation on [[February 17]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties, 4/17/06 through 4/21/06 | work = National Register of Historic Places Listings | url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listings/20060428.HTM}}</ref>

In the 2005 season, the Bears won the NFC North Division and the No. 2 Seed in the NFC Playoffs, entitling them to play at least one home game in the postseason. The team hosted (and lost) their divisional round match on [[January 15]] [[2006]] against the [[Carolina Panthers]]. This was the first playoff game at Soldier Field since the stadium reopened.

The stadium's [[end zone]]s and midfield were not painted until the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Bears History "Bits"| work = Bears History.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagobearshistorybits.aspx | accessdate =  16 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> The design sported on the field included the bolded word "Chicago" in both end zones. In 1983, the end zone design returned, with the addition of a large wishbone "C" Bears logo painted at midfield. These field markings remained unchanged until the [[1996 NFL season|1996 season]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Bears Midfield Logo| work = Bears History.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagobearshistorybits.aspx | accessdate =  16 July|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> In 1996 the midfield wishbone "C" was changed to a large blue Bears head, and the end zone design were painted with "Bears" in cursive. This new design remained until the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]], at which point the artwork was returned to the classic "Chicago" and the "C". In the new Soldier Field, the artwork was tweaked to where one end zone had the word "Chicago" bolded and the other had "Bears".<ref>{{cite web | title = New Soldier Field Art| work = Bears History.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagobearshistorybits.aspx | accessdate =  16 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

==The Bears in popular culture==
While the [[Super Bowl XX]] Champion Bears were a fixture of mainstream American pop culture in the 1980s, the Bears made a prior mark with the 1971 American TV movie ''[[Brian's Song]]'' starring [[Billy Dee Williams]] as Gale Sayers and [[James Caan]] as Brian Piccolo. The film told of how Piccolo helped Sayers recover from a devastating knee injury to return to his status as one of the league's best players, and how Sayers in turn helped the Piccolo family through Brian's fatal illness.<ref>{{cite web | title = Brian's Song (1971)| work = IMDb | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068315/| accessdate =  14 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Reel Life: Brian's Song| work = ESPN | url = http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/021004.html| accessdate =  14 July|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> A 2001 remake of the movie for ABC starred [[Sean Maher]] as Piccolo and [[Mekhi Phifer]] as Sayers.<ref>{{cite web | title = Brian's Song (2001)| work = IMDb | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289873/| accessdate =  14 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

The 1985 team is also remembered for recording the song "[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]", which reached number forty-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Top 10 Greatest NFL Team's of All-Time |work = WatchMojo.com | url = http://www.watchmojo.com/sports/football/010.php| accessdate =  16 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = These records were meant to be broken|work = Floridan | url = http://www.sptimes.com/News/012801/news_pf/Floridian/These_records_were_ma.shtml| accessdate =  28 January|accessyear = 2001 }}</ref> The music video for the song depicts the team gyrating awkwardly and [[rapping]] that they are "not here to start no trouble" but instead "just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle". The team took a risk by recording and releasing the song before the playoffs had even begun, but were able to avoid embarrassment by going on to win Super Bowl XX by a record margin of 46-10. That game was one of the most watched television events in history according to the [[Nielsen Ratings]] system; the game had a rating of 48.3, ranking it seventh in all-time television history.<ref>{{cite web | title = Nielsen's Top 10 | work = Nielsen Ratings | url = http://www.nielsenmedia.com/ratings/topnetworktelecasts.htm| accessdate =  16 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

In addition to the "Super Bowl Shuffle"<ref>{{cite web | title = Remembering the Super Bowl Shuffle | work = ESPN | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=katcher/040825 | accessdate =  1 August | accessyear = 2004 }}</ref> rap song, the Bears' success in the 1980s &ndash; and especially the personality of head coach Mike Ditka &ndash; inspired a recurring sketch on the [[Television in the United States|American]] [[sketch comedy]] [[Television program|program]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', called "[[Bill Swerski's Superfans]]".<ref>{{cite web | title = Bill Swerski's Super Fans | work = SNL Transcripts | url = http://snltranscripts.jt.org/90/90jsuperfans.phtml| accessdate =  14 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> The sketch featured ''[[Cheers]]'' co-star [[George Wendt]], a Chicago native, as host of a radio talk-show (similar in tone to [[WGN (AM)|WGN radio]]'s "The Sportswriters"), with co-panelists Carl Wollarski ([[Robert Smigel]]), Pat Arnold ([[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]) and Todd O'Connor ([[Chris Farley]]). To hear them tell it, "Da Bears" and Coach Ditka could do no wrong. The sketch stopped after Ditka was fired in 1993. The sketch usually showed the panelists drinking lots of beer and eating lots of [[Polish sausage]], and often featured Todd getting so agitated about what was happening with the Bears that he suffered a heart attack, but quickly recovered (through self-administered [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]]). The sketch also features the cast predicting unrealistic blowout victories for Bears games.<ref>{{cite web | title = SNL Super Fans Transcripts | work = SNL Transcripts | url = http://snltranscripts.jt.org/90/90jsuperfans.phtml| accessdate =  14 July | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> A significantly overweight Farley died in 1997 from a drug overdose exacerbated by [[arteriosclerosis]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Chris Farley | work = Find a Death | url = http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/F/Chris%20Farley/chris_farley.htm| accessdate =  14 July|accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> and Da Super Fan sketch has not been brought back by ''SNL'', with the exception of a single appearance by [[Horatio Sanz]] as a Super Fan for the [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] on [[Weekend Update]] in [[2003 in television|2003]].

Ditka's success and popularity in Chicago has led him to land analyst roles on various American football pregame shows. Ditka worked for both the ''[[NFL on NBC]]'' and CBS's ''[[The NFL Today]]'', and he currently works on ESPN's ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' and provides Friday night analysis on the Bears on [[WBBM-TV|CBS 2 Chicago]], the CBS Chicago affiliate, called "2 on Football" with CBS 2 Sports Director [[Mark Malone]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Ditka joins CBS2| work = CBS 2 Chicago (WBBM-TV) | url = http://cbs2chicago.com/pressreleases/local_story_197002133.html| accessdate =  14 July | accessyear = 2004 }}</ref> He is also the color analyst for all local broadcasts of Bears preseason games.

Also, Ditka, [[Dick Butkus]], [[Walter Payton]], [[Jim McMahon]], [[William Perry (American football)|William "Refrigerator" Perry]] and [[Brian Urlacher]] are among Bears figures known for their appearances in TV commercials. Urlacher, whose jersey was the league's best-selling in 2002, is currently featured on [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] commercials with [[Atlanta Falcons]] quarterback [[Michael Vick]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Urlacher's not going anywhere| work = USA Today | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/bears/2003-06-04-urlacher_x.htm| accessdate =  3 June | accessyear = 2003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Different Campaign for Nike | work = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/24/business/media/24adc o.html?ex=1392958800&en=7886de57c2852995&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND| accessdate =  24 February | accessyear = 2004 }}</ref> Brian Urlacher is also featured in Vitamin Water ads.

In a scene from the movie ''[[Planes, Trains & Automobiles]]'', characters Neal Page and Del Griffith awake from their sleep in an embarrassing position.  When the characters realized what has happened, they quickly try changing the subject by making small talk about the Chicago Bears.

Stephen Colbert has frequently referred to the Bears as godless killing machines because of the long runnoing joke about bears on the show.

==Statistics and records==
{{details|Chicago Bears statistics}}

[[Bill George]] and [[Doug Buffone]] hold the record for the most seasons in a Bears uniform with 14.<ref name="records">{{cite web | title = Chicago Bears Team Records | work = Chicago Bears | url = http://org-www.chicagobears.com/history/records.jsp | accessdate =  1 August|accessyear = 2005 }}</ref> George did it between the 1952 and 1965 seasons and Buffone during the 1966 through 1979 seasons. On the other hand, [[Steve McMichael]] holds the record for most consecutive games played by a Bear with 191;<ref name="records" /> he accomplished the feat from 1981 to 1993. In second place is Payton, who played 186 games from 1975 to 1987 at running back, a position considered to be conducive to injury, only missing one game in a span of 13 seasons.

[[Placekicker]] [[Kevin Butler (American football player)|Kevin Butler]] holds the club record<ref name="records" /> for scoring the most points in his ten-year Bear career. He scored 1,116 points as the Bears kicker from 1985 to 1995. He is followed in distant second place by Payton, with 750 points.

Payton holds the team record for career rushing yards with 16,726.<ref name="records" /> That was an NFL record until [[Emmitt Smith]] of the Dallas Cowboys broke it in [[2002 NFL season|2002]]. [[Neal Anderson]], who played from 1986 to 1993, is the closest to Payton's record with 6,166 yards. It is likely that Payton's team record will not be broken in the foreseeable future.

[[Mark Bortz]] holds the record for most Bear playoff appearances, with 13 between 1983 and 1994, and is followed by Kevin Butler, [[Dennis Gentry]], [[Dan Hampton]], [[Jay Hilgenberg]], Steve McMichael, [[Ron Rivera]], [[Mike Singletary]], and [[Keith Van Horne]], who have each played in 12 playoff games.

The 1940 Chicago Bears team holds the record for the biggest margin of victory in an NFL game ([[NFL playoffs|playoff]] or regular season) with a 73&ndash;0 victory over the [[Washington Redskins]] in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1940|1940 NFL Championship Game]]. The largest home victory for the Bears came in a 61&ndash;7 result against the Green Bay Packers in 1980. The largest defeat in club history was a 52-0 loss against the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] in 1964.

The club recorded undefeated regular seasons in 1934 and 1942, but (unlike the 1972 Dolphins) did not win the championship game in either season. In 1934, the club completed a 13&ndash;0 record but were defeated by the [[New York Giants]], and in 1942 the club completed an 11&ndash;0 record but were defeated by the Redskins. Had the Bears won either championship, the club would have completed a championship three-peat &ndash; a feat completed only by the Packers (twice), although no team has done it since the [[AFL-NFL merger]].<ref>{{cite web | title = NFL History | work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/standings | accessdate =  1 August | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

Halas holds the team record for coaching the most seasons with 40 and for having the most career victories of 324. Halas' victories record stood until [[Don Shula]] surpassed Halas in [[1993 NFL season|1993]]. Ditka is the closest Bears coach to Halas, with 112 career victories. No other Bears coach has recorded over 100 victories with the team.<ref name="records" />

Recently, return specialist [[Devin Hester]] has set several kick return records. During his rookie season in [[2006 Chicago Bears|2006]], Hester returned had six touchdown returns, setting a record for most returns in a single season.<ref name="Hester-SB">SuperBowl.com, [http://www.superbowl.com/news/story/9968501 Hester is Chicago's not-so-secret weapon] Retrieved on [[February  28]], [[2007]]</ref> One of the most notable of these returns came on [[November 12]], [[2006]], when he returned a missed field goal for a 108-yard touchdown.<ref>ESPN.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=261112019 Hester's record return pushes Bears past sleeping Giants] Retrieved on [[March 11]], [[2007]]</ref> The record tied teammate [[Nathan Vasher]]'s previous record, which was set almost a year earlier. <ref>ESPN.com Page 2, [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=nfl/week10/damn-moment The Damn!
