'''Sir Thomas Sean Connery'''<!--Knight bachelor - no postnominal--> (born [[25 August]] [[1930]]) is an [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[actor]] and [[film producer|producer]] who is perhaps best known as the first actor to portray [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] in cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4799550.stm|title=Profile: Sean Connery|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2007-03-19|date=2006-03-12}}</ref> He starred in seven Bond films (six [[EON Productions|EON]]-produced films, 1962–67 and 1971; and an unofficial Columbia-produced ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''-remake in 1983).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125/|title=Sean Connery filmography|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>

Connery is known for his [[Scottish English|Scottish accent]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4180373.stm|title=Connery's accent is UK favourite|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2007-03-19|date=2005-01-17}}</ref> and rugged good looks. He repeatedly is named as one of the most [[Physical attractiveness|attractive]] men alive by [[magazine]]s, though he is older than most [[sex symbols]]. He is also a vocal and visible supporter of the [[Scottish National Party]], often campaigning for their cause of [[Scottish independence]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Connery was born in [[Edinburgh]] to a factory worker and truck driver father and a charwoman mother.<ref>http://www.filmreference.com/film/58/Sean-Connery.html</ref> His father, Joseph Connery, was a [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Roman Catholic]] of [[Irish-Scots|Irish descent]] with roots in [[County Wexford]], while his mother, Euphamia "Effie" Maclean, was a [[Protestant]]. He claims he was called Sean, his midname, long before becoming an actor, explaining that he had an Irish friend named Seamus and those who knew them decided to call him by his middle name when with Seamus.

His first job was as a milkman, with [[St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society]].<ref>[http://heritage.scotsman.com/greatscots.cfm?id=2275262005 From the Co-op with love.. the days Sir Sean earned £1 a week]</ref> He then joined the [[Royal Navy]], but was later [[Military discharge|discharge]]d on medical grounds, because of a stomach [[ulcer]], afterwards, he returned to the Co-op, then worked other jobs, including truck driving, [[labourer]], [[Model (art)|artist's model]] for the [[Edinburgh College of Art]]<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=924382003 Even as an unknown, Sean was still a draw]</ref>, coffin polisher, and [[lifeguard]]. 

Under the name Thom Connery, he placed third in the tall man's division of the 1953 [[Mr. Universe]] contest.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Fellow competitor, Johnny Isaacs, suggested he audition for a stage production of ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', which led to stage, television, and film work. A prominent television role was in [[Rudolph Cartier]]'s 1961 production of ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' for [[BBC Television]], in which he co-starred with [[Claire Bloom]].<ref name="karenina">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1181098/index.html|title=Cartier, Rudolph (1904&ndash;1994)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>
He also acted in ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' (1956) starring Albert Sharpe; his first American television role was as a porter in an episode of ''[[The Jack Benny Show]]''.

===James Bond (1962-1967, 1971, 1983)===
Best known to cinema audiences as secret agent [[James Bond]], he acted in seven Bond films, first in ''Dr. No'' (1962) and last in ''Never Say Never Again'' (1983); his filmography is:
 
*''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]])
*''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]'' ([[1963 in film|1963]])
*''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]])
*''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]])
*''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' ([[1967 in film|1967]])
*''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]])
*''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]])  (Columbia pictures Bond Film)

The imposing, yet light-footed, actor was discovered by [[Harry Saltzman]], after other aspirants to the Bond role  were eliminated, including [[David Niven]] (later, a Bond parody in the spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', in 1967), [[Cary Grant]], and [[James Mason]], both were excluded for refusing to commit to a film series . The low budget forced the producers to hire an unknown actor; thus was Connery cast.

James Bond's creator, [[Ian Fleming]] doubted the casting, saying, "He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks", adding that Connery (muscular, 6'2", and a Scot) was unrefined. Yet Fleming's girlfriend told him Connery had the requisite sexual charisma. Fleming changed his mind after the successful ''Dr. No'' premiere; so impressed, he later created a half-Scot, half-Swiss heritage for the literary James Bond in the later novels.

Connery's portrayal of Bond is consequence of stylistic tutelage from director [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], to polish the actor, while using his physical grace and presence for the action. [http://www.hmss.com/films/young.htm Robert Cotton] wrote in one Connery biography that [[Lois Maxwell]] (the first [[Miss Moneypenny]]) noticed, "Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat". Cotton wrote, "Some cast members remarked that Connery was simply doing a Terence Young impression, but Young and Connery knew they were on the right track."

In June of 1967, after the unsatisfying filming ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', Connery quit the role, having tired of repetitive plots, no character development, the public's demands of him, and fear of [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]. Adding that he disliked the fantastic direction in which the series was headed, that the producers were straying far from the source. 

In 1968, [[George Lazenby]] replaced him in [[1969 in film|1969]]'s ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', however, Lazenby backed out of a seven-film contract, quitting before the film's release. His performance elicited mixed critical and public responses, but his film was not a financial failure, and is looked back on well by many James Bond fans. 

In 1970, Connery was re-hired by United Artists president David Picker for £1.25 million (then a record salary for an actor), that he donated to charity.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Thus, Connery's final official appearance as secret agent 007 in [[1971 in film|1971]]'s ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''; reportedly, he declined £5 million to make [[Live and Let Die (film)|Live And Let Die]] (1973).

In 1978, consequent to complex dealing between [[EON Productions]] and [[Kevin McClory]] (''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' co-produce and co-creator of the story in  [[Ian Fleming]]'s eponymous novel), the latter obtained the right to re-make ''Thunderball''. McClory and Connery were to write an original Bond film, titled either ''James Bond of the Secret Service'' or ''Warhead'', but EON and [[United Artists]] blocked him in court. 

The re-make was revived in the 1980s, and Connery was to play Bond for the seventh, and final, time in the 'unofficial' film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''; its title said to derive from Connery's comments after ''Diamonds Are Forever''. After its filming, he said he'd never again play Bond; (about the lawsuit, see [[Thunderball (film)#The controversy over the novel|the controversy of ''Thunderball'']]). Yet, in 2005, Connery again reprised the role in with his voice and physical likeness for the [[video game]] adaptation of ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia With Love]]''.

His favorite Bond film is ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]'', one of the most acclaimed in the series; confirming this in a 2002 interview with [[Sam Donaldson]] for ABCNews.com.; ([[American Movie Classics]] mistakenly listed ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' as Connery's favorite during a Bond retrospective).

More than forty years after playing the role, Connery's incarnation remains as the definitive cinema James Bond, despite popular interpretations by [[Roger Moore]], [[Timothy Dalton]] (often considered akin to the literary Bond), and [[Pierce Brosnan]]. Connery's feelings about James Bond range from resentment to fondness, once saying he hated the character so much that he'd have killed him, but also saying he never hated Bond, but merely wanted to portray other characters. Certainly, when the James Bond series was at its peak in the mid-1960s, his association with James Bond 007 was so great that his performances in films, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', ''[[A Fine Madness]]'', and [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'', were ignored. When asked if he'd ever escape the identification, he replied, "Never, it's with me 'til I go in the box".

At another point, he said he still cared about the future of the character and the franchise, having been its icon for too long not to care, and that all Bond films had their good points. In December of 2005, Connery supported [[Daniel Craig]] as the latest James Bond, in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''.

===Post-James Bond career===
Although his most famous role was that of Bond, Sean Connery has also maintained a successful career since, much more so than any of the other actors who assumed the role. As part of the agreement to appear in ''Diamonds are Forever'', Connery was given carte blanche to produce two films for United Artists but felt that the only film made under this deal, ''[[The Offence]]'', was buried by the studio. Apart from ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'', most of Connery's successes in the next decade were as part of ensemble casts, in films such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' and ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (in which he acted in a scene opposite [[Sir Laurence Olivier]]).  His portrayal of Berber chieftain [[Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli]] in [[John Milius]]'s ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'' (1975) gained him considerable acclaim from critics and audiences and showed his range as an actor. After his experience with ''Never Say Never Again'' and the following court case, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and for two years did not make any films. 

Following the successful European production ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'', for which he won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award, Connery's interest in more credible material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' showcased his ability to play older, wise mentors to young, leading protagonists, which would become a recurring role in many of his later films. The following year, his acclaimed performance as a hard-nosed cop in ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987) earned him an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. 

Subsequent box-office hits such as ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989) (in which he played the father of Harrison Ford, actually only 12 years his junior), ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990), ''[[The Russia House]]'' (1990), ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (1996), and ''[[Entrapment (film)|Entrapment]]'' (1999) re-established him as a bankable leading man. Both ''Last Crusade'' and ''The Rock'' alluded to his James Bond days. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas wanted "the father of Indy" to be Connery since Bond directly inspired the Indiana Jones series, while his character in ''The Rock'', John Patrick Mason, was a British secret service agent imprisoned since the 1960s. In more recent years, Connery's filmography has included its fair share of box office and critical disappointments such as ''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]'' (1998) and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' (2003), but he also received positive reviews for films including ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000). He also later received a [[Crystal Globe]] for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema. He has sometimes received criticism for never losing his accent, even when playing Russian and Irish characters, but he says this is out of respect for his country.

In 1987-88, Connery was attached to star in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television series]] ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', which was ultimately a [[sitcom]] that blended elements of [[science fiction]] with [[comedy]] (similar to ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy]]''). Connery was to appear as the [[captain]] of the [[spaceship]] ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf]]''. However the role was written in as being slightly overweight and slightly inept, and so with the part being unfitting for Connery it was eventually passed to an American comedic actor, [[Mac McDonald]]. This was revealed in the ''Red Dwarf'' Series I DVD commentary.

Sean Connery also provided the voice for the character of [[Athair]], grandfather of [[Knuckles the Echidna]], in three episodes of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' cartoon series ''[[Sonic Underground]]''<ref>http://www.tv.com/sean-connery/person/86683/appearances.html#</ref>

===Retirement===
In September 2004, media reports indicated that Connery intended to retire after pulling out of ''[[Josiah's Canon]]'', which was set for a 2005 release. However, in a December 2004 interview with ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper from his home in the [[Bahamas]], Connery explained he had taken a break from acting in order to concentrate on writing his [[autobiography]]. However, the book project was later abandoned because the publishers wanted to delve too far into his private life. Connery has long denied accusations from his first wife [[Diane Cilento]] that he physically abused her during their marriage.

About a month before his 75th birthday, over the weekend of July 30th/31st 2005, it was widely reported in the broadcast media (and again in ''The Scotsman'',<ref>http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=1707662005</ref> that he had decided to retire from film making following disillusionment with the "idiots now in Hollywood", and the turmoil making and subsequent box office failure of the 2003 film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]].'' He stated in interviews for the film included on the DVD release that he was offered roles in both ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' series, declining both due to "not understanding them", and after they went on to have huge box office grosses he decided to accept the ''League'' role despite not "understanding" it either.

At the [[Tartan Day]] celebrations in [[New York]] in March 2006, Connery again confirmed his retirement from acting, and stated that he is now writing a history book.

As a personality he has been accused of being an overbearing bully, but has also been praised as a highly professional actor, courteous and supportive of those around him. He made a big impression on actors such as [[Harrison Ford]], [[Kevin Costner]], Pat Adams, and [[Christopher Lambert]], who considered him a great friend during filming. He refused to be directed in a movie by [[Barbra Streisand]], and he did not get along with the director of his last film.

He was planning to star in an $80 million movie about [[Saladin]] and the [[Crusades]] that would be filmed in [[Jordan]] before the producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] was killed in the [[2005 Amman bombings]]. Connery received the [[American Film Institute]]'s Lifetime Achievement Award on [[8 June]] [[2006]], where he again confirmed his retirement from acting. On [[7 June]] [[2007]], he denied rumors that he would appear in the [[Indiana Jones 4|fourth "Indiana Jones"]] film, stating that "retirement is just too much damned fun".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6733177.stm "Connery bows out of Indiana film"], BBC News, [[June 8]], [[2007]]</ref>

===Personal life===
Allegedly, while filming the movie, ''[[Another Time, Another Place (1958 film)|Another Time, Another Place]]'', [[Lana Turner]] was rumoured to have been having an affair with Connery, her co-star. [[Johnny Stompanato]] stormed onto the set, and during a verbal altercation with Connery, Stompanato waved a gun in Connery's face. Connery reacted by taking the gun away from him, physically beating Stompanato and sending him off the film set. After Stompanato's death, there were rumours that [[organized crime]] mobsters believed Connery had helped bring on the eventual demise of Stompanato, and Connery is alleged to have laid low for a time. There is no evidence that Connery and Turner were having an affair; this sort of behaviour was apparently normal for Stompanato.<ref>http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/lana_turner/6.html</ref><ref>http://www.total-movies.com/content_pages/000710_a.asp</ref><ref>http://www.freeinfodirectory.com/Movies/Who_Is_James.htm</ref><ref>http://www.granta.com/extracts/2144</ref>

Connery was married to the [[Australia|Australian-born]] actress [[Diane Cilento]] from 1962 until 1973 (he was her second husband). They have one son, [[Jason Connery]] (born [[January 11]], [[1963]]), who was educated at [[Millfield School]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]], and the rigorous [[Gordonstoun]] boarding school in Scotland, before going on to become an actor. According to Jason, his parents' divorce was an extremely bitter and painful affair (Diane Cilento has reportedly just written an autobiography that paints an unflattering portrait of her ex-husband). In 1975, Sean Connery married [[France|French]] artist [[Micheline Roquebrune]], who is the grandmother of French television journalist Stéphanie Renouvin. He has one grandchild from his son Jason's marriage to actress [[Mia Sara]], a grandson named Dashiell Quinn Connery (born in June 1997). He holds an honorary shodan in [[Kyokushin]] karate.

====Accusations of abuse====
In her autobiography ''My Nine Lives''<ref>http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/Celebs/Bang/ContentPosting.aspx?newsitemid=BSBS40342&feedname=BANG&show=False&number=0&showbyline=False&subtitle=&detect=&abc=abc</ref> and subsequent interviews on radio and in print<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=652&id=1993262005 The Scotsman]</ref> [[Diane Cilento]] claimed that Connery had beaten her on several occasions, accusations that Connery vehemently denied.

He caused an uproar in a December 1987 interview with [[Barbara Walters]] in which he said it was okay for a man to slap a woman with limited force, assuming that it was required to calm her down or "keep her in line".<ref>see the video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FgMLROTqJ0 interview</ref> Connery had made similar remarks in a November 1965 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine on the set of ''Thunderball''.

In ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1993 he said: "There are women who take it to the wire. That's what they are looking for, the ultimate confrontation. They want a smack."

===Political causes===
[[Image:ConneryKilt.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Sean Connery at a [[Tartan Day]] celebration in [[Washington D.C.]]]]
Connery has long supported the [[Scottish National Party]], a left-of-centre political party campaigning for [[Scottish independence]], both financially and through personal appearances. His involvement in [[Scottish politics]] has attracted considerable criticism, since he has not resided in Scotland for more than fifty years. His support for the SNP is illustrated by a comment from his official website:

{{cquote|While it is generally accepted that his support of Scotland's independence and the Scottish National Party delayed his knighthood for many years, his commitment to Scotland has never wavered. [[Politics of the United Kingdom|Politics in the United Kingdom]] often has more intrigue than a James Bond plot. While Scotland is not yet independent, she does have a [[Scottish Parliament|new parliament]]. Sir Sean campaigned hard for the yes vote during the [[Scotland referendum, 1997|Scottish Referendum]] that created the new [[Scottish Parliament]]. He believes firmly that the Scottish Parliament will grow in power and that Scotland will be independent within his lifetime.|30px|30px|SeanConnery.com on Sean Connery's support of the Scottish National Party|http://www.seanconnery.com/biography/knighthood/}}

Connery used his fee from ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971) to establish a [[Charitable organization|charity]] to support deprived children in Edinburgh as well as Scottish [[film production]]. He suggested in 1997 that the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] had prevented him being knighted for his charitable work because of his support for the SNP. At the time a Labour Party spokesman stated Connery's knighthood had been blocked because of remarks the actor had made in several past interviews condoning the physical abuse of women. 

Connery received the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' in 1991. He received [[Kennedy Center Honors]] from the [[United States]] in 1999, presented to him by President [[Bill Clinton]]. He received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] on [[July 5]], [[2000]], wearing a hunting [[tartan]] [[kilt]] of the [[Clan Maclean|MacLean of Duart]] [[Scottish clan|clan]]. He also received the [[Orden de Manuel Amador Guerrero]] from [[Mireya Moscoso]], former president of [[Panama]] on [[11 March]] [[2003]], for his talent and versatility as an actor.

===Health===
In 1993 news that Connery was undergoing [[radiation treatment]] for an undisclosed throat ailment sparked media reports that the actor was suffering from [[throat cancer]] following years of heavy smoking, and he was falsely declared dead by the Japanese and South African news agencies. Connery immediately appeared on the [[David Letterman]] show to deny all of this. In a February 1995 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', he claimed the radiation treatment was to remove "nodules" from his vocal cords. His father, a heavy smoker, died from [[throat cancer]] in 1972. In 2003 he had surgery to remove [[cataracts]] from both eyes. On [[March 12]], [[2006]], he announced he was recovering from surgery to remove a kidney tumour in January.

===Connery in popular culture===
Connery's distinctive speaking voice has sometimes made him a target of satire, most notably in the recurring ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch "[[Celebrity Jeopardy! (Saturday Night Live)|Celebrity Jeopardy!]]" In the sketches, Connery (as portrayed by [[Darrell Hammond]]) taunts and mocks host [[Alex Trebek]] (played by [[Will Ferrell]]) and makes numerous lewd references and jokes about women sexually. Hammond would also play Connery for a fake trailer for a [[live action]] [[Smurfs]] movie, where Connery played [[Papa Smurf]].

Comedian and talk show host [[Craig Ferguson]] has imitated Connery as well as [[Michael Caine]], sometimes pairing the two together in a spliced sketch.

Connery's role in ''Finding Forrester'', specifically his line "You're the man now, dog!", became the inspiration for the popular website [[YTMND.com]].

He was voted to have the worst movie accent by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', for his performance in [[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]. He has been derided, but also applauded, for using the same accent for every character, despite playing roles as diverse as an [[Irish American]] Chicago cop (''[[The Untouchables]]''), the English king [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]''), and a [[Lithuania]]n Soviet submarine captain (''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'').<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3032052.stm Connery "has worst film accent"]</ref>

He has an [[asteroid]] named after him, [[13070 Seanconnery]].
