A '''[[ladder]] match''' is a type of [[List of professional wrestling match types|match used in professional wrestling]] that is most commonly used to describe a match where an item (usually a title belt) is hung above the ring, and the winner is the contestant who climbs a ladder and retrieves the item.<ref name="WWE">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/laddermatch|title=Inside WWE > Specialty Matches |accessdate=2007-07-17 |publisher=WWE}}</ref> The ladder itself becomes a key feature of the match, as wrestlers will use the ladder as a weapon to strike the opponent(s), as a launching pad for acrobatic attacks, and frequently these matches include impressive falls from the top of the ladder.<ref name="WWE"/> 

Ladder Matches are often used as a finale to storylines and it is more common to have symbolic briefcases (usually "containing" a contract for a future championship match) or championships belts hung above the ring. Ladder matches are always fought under [[hardcore wrestling|no disqualification]] rules.

==Origins==
The Ladder Match was invented by [[Dan Kroffat]] of the [[Stampede Wrestling]] organization out of Canada.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} In September 1972, Stampede Wrestling held the first-ever Ladder Match between Dan Kroffat and [[Tor Kamata]], where the object to be grabbed was a wad of money.  

In [[July]] [[1983]] Stampede Wrestling held a Ladder Match where [[Bret Hart]] faced off against [[Bad News Allen|Bad News Brown]]. Hart went on to join the WWF and suggested this type of match to promoter [[Vince McMahon]], where the gimmick achieved its current popularity.

==Other variations==
*'''[[King of the Mountain match]]''' - Used in TNA; essentially a ladder match in reverse, the winner (referred to as the "King of the Mountain") is the first person to attach the object specificed beforehand (usually a championship belt) to the wire above the ring.
*'''Stairway to Hell''' - Used mainly in ECW; in this variation instead of a title being suspended above the ring there's a weapon, usually a ball of barbed wire. Once you've taken down the weapon you are then free to use it, you win the match via pin or submission the same as a singles match.
*'''[[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]]''' - Variation of the ladder match where tables and chairs are also permitted (and their use is encouraged). Referred to at times simply as TLC matches.
*'''[[Money in the Bank ladder match]]''' - Ladder match where multiple competitors try to climb a ladder to obtain a contract for a future World Title shot against any champion within the next 12 months.
