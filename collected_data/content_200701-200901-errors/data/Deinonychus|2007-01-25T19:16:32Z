'''''Deinonychus''''' ({{IPA2|dai.ˈna.ni.kəs}}) meaning 'terrible claw' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''δεινος'' meaning 'terrible' and ''ονυξ/ονυχος'' meaning 'claw') was a 7-10 foot long, carnivorous [[dromaeosaurid]] [[dinosaur]] [[species]] from the Early [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. Its name refers to the unusually large, sickle-shaped talon (on the second toe of each hind foot), which was probably held retracted while the dinosaur walked on the third and fourth toes. It was commonly thought that ''Deinonychus'' would kick with the sickle claw to slash at its prey but recent tests on reconstructions of similar ''[[Velociraptor]]'' talons suggest that the claw was used to stab, not slash.{{fact}} As in other dromaeosaurids, the tail was stiffened by a series of ossified tendons. This might have given ''Deinonychus'' greater balance and turning ability, and lends it its specific name, ''D. antirrhopus'', which means 'counterbalancing'.

==History of discovery==
[[Image:Deinonychus_skeleton_FMNH.jpg|left|thumb|''Deinonychus'' skeleton]]
The fossilized remains of ''Deinonychus'' were first discovered by paleontologists [[John Ostrom]] and Grant E. Meyer in August of 1964, in the [[Cloverly Formation]] of southern [[Montana]], near the town of [[Bridger, Montana|Bridger]].<ref name="ostrom1969">Ostrom, J. H. (1969) "Osteology of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'', an unusual theropod from the Lower Cretaceous of Montana." ''Peabody Museum of Natural History Bulletin'', '''30''': 1-165.</ref> Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1000 bones representing between at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine for certain, the [[Type (zoology)|type]] specimen of ''Deinonychus'' was restricted only to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in 50 separate entries at the [[Yale University|Yale]] [[Peabody Museum]]. 

A skeleton of ''Deinonychus'' can be seen on display at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] or the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. The American Museum and Harvard specimens are from a different locality than the Yale specimens. Based on the largest specimens, ''Deinonychus'' had a maximum skull length of 410 mm (16.4 in), a hip height of 1.2 m (4 ft), a maximum weight of 80 kg (175 lb), and a total length of 3 m (10 ft).

===Implications===
The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and open the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been [[warm-blooded]]. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the 'hand' of ''Deinonychus'' and that of birds, which observation led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs.<ref name="ostrom1976b">Ostrom, J. H. (1976b) "''Archaeopteryx'' and the origin of birds." ''Biological Journal of the Linnean Society'', '''8''': 91-182.</ref> Thirty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted. In fact, ''Deinonychus'' and other [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]]  are so birdlike that there has been debate whether they are in fact true birds. Finds of related dinosaurs from China, such as ''[[Sinornithosaurus]]'' and ''[[Microraptor]]'' indicate that this dinosaur may have borne feathers. Other relatives include ''[[Velociraptor]]'', ''[[Utahraptor]]'', and ''[[Dromaeosaurus]]''.

==Paleobiology==
[[Image:Deinonychus-antirrhopus jconway.jpg|left|thumb|Life restoration of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'']]
Based on the association of a number of ''Deinonychus'' skeletons in a single quarry, and and the fact that shed teeth of ''Deinonychus'' have been found along side skeletons of the [[ornithopod]] dinosaur ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'', indicating that ''Deinonychus'' fed on that species, and perhaps hunted it. Ostrom and Maxwell have even used this information to speculate that ''Deinonychus'' might have lived and hunted in packs.<ref name="maxwell&ostrom1995">Maxwell, W.D., and Ostrom, J.H. (1995). "Taphonomy and paleobiological implications of ''Tenontosaurus''-''Deinonychus'' associations." ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'', '''15'''(4): 707-712.</ref>

Despite being the most distinctive feature of ''Deinonychus'', the shape and curvature of the sickle-claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes.<ref name="ostrom1976">Ostrom, J. H. (1976a) "On a new specimen of the Lower Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Deinonychus antirrhopus''." ''Breviora'', '''439''': 1-21.</ref> Ostrom suggested that this difference in the size and shape of the sickle claws could be due to individual variation, sexual variation, or age-related variation.

Dromaeosaurids, especially ''Deinonychus'', are often depicted as unusually fast-running animals in the popular media, and Ostrom himself speculated that ''Deinonychus'' was fleet-footed in his original description.<ref name="ostrom1969"/> However, when first described, a complete leg of ''Deinoncyhus'' had not been found, and Ostrom's speculation about the length of the femur (upper leg bone) later proved to have been an overestimate. In a later study, Ostrom noted that the ratio of the femur to the tibia (lower leg bone) is not as important in determining speed as the relative length of the foot and lower leg. In modern, fleet-footed birds like the [[ostrich]], the foot-tibia ratio is .95. In unusually fast-running dinosaurs like ''[[Struthiomimus]]'', the ratio is .68, and in ''Deinonychus'', the ratio is a surprisingly low .48.<ref name="ostrom1976"/> Ostrom stated that the "only reasonable conclusion" is that ''Deinoncyhus'' was not particularly fast compared to other dinosaurs, and certainly not as fast as modern flightless birds.

The low foot to lower leg ratio in ''Deinonychus'' is due partly to an unusually short metatarsus (upper foot bones). The metatarsus of smaller individuals, while still short, are longer than those in larger individuals. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus may be related to the function of the sickle claw, and uses the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features--the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.--as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attatchments in the ''Deinonychus'' leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles were used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of ''Deinonychus'' represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.<ref name="ostrom1976"/>
