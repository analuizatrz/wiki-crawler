'''Timothy "Tim" William Burton''' (born [[August 25]], [[1958]]) is an [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[United States|American]] [[film director]], [[writer]] and [[designer]] notable for the quirky and gothic atmosphere of his films.

==Early life==
Burton was born in [[Burbank, Los Angeles County, California|Burbank, California]], the first of two sons to Bill Burton and Jean Erickson. His year of birth is sometimes mistakenly given as 1960, most notably in his own books, ''The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy'' and the picture book of ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''.  Burton described his childhood self as quirky, self-absorbed and highly imaginative. As a child growing up in Burbank, he staged an axe murder with his brother to scare the neighbors, prompting them to call the police. He repeated the prank again with similar results. He found home life and school difficult, often escaping  the reality of everyday life by watching horror and low budget films, to which he would later pay tribute in [[Ed Wood (film)|his biography]] of [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]].  Another film figure of importance in Burton's childhood is [[Vincent Price]], whose filmography would deeply influence the upcoming director's career. He was inspired early on by [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop-motion films.

After high school, he won a Disney scholarship to attend the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in [[Valencia, California]]. He studied [[animation]] for three years. Burton's first job in animation was working as a cel painter on [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/518/518805p1.html |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09|publisher=IGN Filmforce}}</ref><ref name="EI8">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1517&sid=601500f503e3dc48d13ca4a47d25be52 |title=Bakshi Board Exclusive Interview #8 |accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> Burton was then hired by the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Walt Disney Studios]] as an animator apprentice. Burton's job was to draw for ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]'', but he was dissatisfied with the artistic direction of the movie. He later commented on the refusal of Disney to use his design for ''The Fox and the Hound'' because his designs made the characters, in opposition to Disney's desires, "look like roadkill." Burton was not happy during his Disney period, but it was during this period that he wrote and drew the poem and illustrations that would be the basis for his celebrated ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''.

==Early career==
In 1982, Burton made his first short, ''[[Vincent (film)|Vincent]]'', a six-minute [[stop-motion]] film about a young boy who fantasizes that he is his (and Burton's) screen idol [[Vincent Price]], with Price himself providing narration. This was followed by the live-action short ''[[Frankenweenie]]'', starring [[Barret Oliver]], [[Daniel Stern]] and [[Shelley Duvall]] (an early supporter of Burton's work). Shot in black and white and inspired by [[James Whale]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''Frankenweenie'' features a boy who reanimates his dog Sparky who was hit by a car. Although the film won praise at film festivals, Disney was concerned that the film was too scary for children and, not knowing what to do with it, shelved the film. (''Frankenweenie'' later received a video release in 1992).

Although Burton's work had yet to see wide release, he began to attract the attention of the film industry. Actor/producer [[Griffin Dunne]], approached Burton to direct ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), a comedy about a bored word processor who survives a crazy night in [[SoHo]] that had already been passed over by [[Martin Scorsese]]. However, when financing for ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' fell through, Burton bowed out of the project out of respect for Scorsese.

Not long after, actor [[Paul Reubens]] saw ''Frankenweenie'' and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spinoff of his popular character [[Pee-wee Herman]], who had gained popularity with a successful stage show at the Roxy, which had been turned into an HBO special. The film, ''[[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), was made on a budget of $7 million and grossed more than $40 million at the box office. Burton, a fan of the eccentric musical group [[Oingo Boingo]], asked vocalist/songwriter [[Danny Elfman]] to provide the music for the film. Since then, Elfman has provided the score for all but three Burton films, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', [[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]] and ''[[Sweeney Todd (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]''.

After directing episodes for the revitalized TV series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', Burton received his next big project. ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), a supernatural comedy about a young couple forced to cope with life after death, as well as a family of pretentious yuppies invading their treasured New England home. Starring [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Geena Davis]], and featuring [[Michael Keaton]] as the famously repulsive demon Beetlejuice, the film grossed about $80 million on a relatively low budget. The film also snagged a Best Makeup Design Oscar.

===''Batman''===
{{main|Batman (1989 film)}}
Burton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives and he received his first big budget film ''Batman'' (1989). The mega-budget production, based in London, was plagued with problems. Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers, [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], but the most notable debacle involved casting. Burton wanted to cast [[Michael Keaton]] from his previous role as [[Beetlejuice]], despite Keaton's average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor. Although Burton won out in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent that Warner Brothers' share price slumped. Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a bulked-up he-man as Batman, insisting that the Caped Crusader should be an ordinary (albeit fabulously wealthy) man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals. Burton cast [[Jack Nicholson]] as the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] ([[Tim Curry]] being his second choice) in a move that helped assuage fans' fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a superhero film. When the film opened in [[1989#June|June]] [[1989 in film|1989]], it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing well over [[United States dollar|$]]400 million worldwide and $250 million in the U.S. alone (numbers not adjusted for inflation). The film proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of [[Superman]] for a grimmer look and characters with more psychological depth. The stylized gothic look of Gotham City ended up being adopted as the look of the city in the comic books.

==The 1990s==
===''Edward Scissorhands''===
{{main|Edward Scissorhands}}
In [[1990]], Burton co-wrote (with [[Caroline Thompson]]) and directed ''Edward Scissorhands'', re-uniting with [[Winona Ryder]] from the "Beetlejuice" days. [[Johnny Depp]], a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old fashioned inventor (played by [[Vincent Price]], in his last appearance on screen before his death). Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator. Set in suburbia (the film was shot in Florida), the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his own childhood in the suburb of Burbank. Price at one point is said to have remarked, "Tim is Edward." Johnny Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, ''Burton on Burton'', regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film. ''Edward'' is considered Burton's best movie by many fans and critics. Following this collaboration with Burton, Depp went on to star in ''[[Ed Wood]]'', ''[[Sleepy Hollow]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and as a voice actor in ''[[Corpse Bride]]''. Depp is also starring in Burton's adaptation of ''[[Sweeney Todd]]'', to be released in December 2007.

===''Batman Returns''===
{{main|Batman Returns}}
Although Warner Brothers had declined to make the more personal ''Scissorhands'' even after the success of ''Batman'', Burton finally agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Brothers on the condition that he would be granted total control. The result was ''Batman Returns'' which featured [[Michael Keaton]] returning as the Dark Knight, and a new triad of villains: [[Danny DeVito]] (as the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]), [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] (as [[Catwoman]]), and [[Christopher Walken]].  Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children. Audiences were even more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume. One critic remarked, "too many villains spoiled the Batman," highlighting Burton's decision to focus the storyline more on the villains instead of Batman. The film also polarized the fanbase, with some loving the darkness and quirkiness, while others felt it wasn´t true to the core aspects of the source material.  Tim Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would be applied to the Penguin in both comics and television. While in the comics, he was an ordinary man, Burton created a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed, flipper-like fingers, a hooked, beak-like nose, and a penguin-like body. ''[[Batman Returns]]'' grossed $160 million in the USA (number not adjusted for inflation) which, while a big success, was much less than expected.

Burton then went on to do preliminary work on the [[Batman Forever|third installment in the franchise]]. [[Val Kilmer]] was cast as the title character (after Michael Keaton turned down the offer to reprise his previous role after Burton's departure from the project), [[Chris O'Donnell]] was cast as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Jim Carrey]] was cast as [[the Riddler]] (after [[Robin Williams]] turned down the part), [[Tommy Lee Jones]] was cast as [[Two-Face]], and [[Nicole Kidman]] was cast as love interest Dr. Chase Meridian. Warner Brothers ultimately threw out Burton after they realized the tone of the film was to be similar to ''Batman Returns''.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Burton left the Batman franchise (but returned as a producer for the [[Joel Schumacher]]–directed ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995), a movie which he said had a title "like a tattoo you get when you're on drugs").

===''The Nightmare Before Christmas''=== 
{{main|The Nightmare Before Christmas}}
Next, Burton wrote and produced (but did not direct, due to schedule constraints on ''Batman Returns'') ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' (1993), originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme. The film was directed by [[Henry Selick]] and written by [[Michael McDowell (author)|Michael McDowell]] and Caroline Thompson, based on Burton's original story, world and characters.  The film continues to have a wide cult following. Burton collaborated with Selick again for ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996), which Burton co-produced. The movie helped to generate a renewed interest in stop-motion animation.

A combination of a child-like fantasy tale turned gothic and musical numbers composed by Danny Elfman, ''Nightmare Before Christmas'' went on to become a [[cult movie]], with a large selection of merchandising.

A deleted scene from ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' features a group of vampires playing hockey on the frozen pond with the decapitated head of producer Tim Burton. The head was later replaced with a [[jack-o-lantern]].

===''Ed Wood''===
{{main|Ed Wood (film)}}
His next film, ''Ed Wood'' (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.|Ed Wood Jr]], a filmmaker sometimes called "the worst director of all time." Starring [[Johnny Depp]] in the title role, the film is a homage to the low-budget sci-fi and horror films of Burton's childhood, and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity. Due to creative squabbles during the making of ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', [[Danny Elfman]] declined to score ''Ed Wood'', and the assignment went to [[Howard Shore]]. While a commercial failure at the time of its release, ''Ed Wood'' was well received by critics and has since gathered a considerable fanbase, as well as helped revive the public interest for the films of Ed Wood Jr. [[Martin Landau]] also received an Academy Award, in the Best Supporting Actor category, for his portrayal of [[Bela Lugosi]].

===''Mars Attacks!''===
{{main|Mars Attacks!}}
Elfman and Burton reunited for ''Mars Attacks!'' (1996). Based on a popular science fiction trading card series, the film was a hybrid of 1950s' sci-fi flicks and 1970s' all-star disaster flicks -- an anarchic cacophony of clever satire and goofy mayhem. Coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster, ''[[Independence Day (movie)|Independence Day]]'', made around the same time and released five months earlier. Although the film boasted an all-star cast, including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] and [[Rod Steiger]], among others, the film was panned by American critics and mostly ignored by American audiences. It was however more successful abroad, and later managed to gather an American fan base from its television airings and DVD release.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===''Sleepy Hollow''===
{{main|Sleepy Hollow (film)}}
''Sleepy Hollow'' released in the autumn of 1999, was a return to vintage Burton, with a supernatural setting, unique sets and another offbeat performance by [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Ichabod Crane]], now a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of [[Washington Irving]]'s original tale. An enthusiastic fan of the old horror movies from English company [[Hammer Film Productions]], Burton paid homage to them with ''Hollow''. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles  ([[Michael Gough]],  [[Ian McDiarmid]],  [[Jeffrey Jones]] and [[Christopher Walken]], among others) and [[Christina Ricci]] was cast as Katrina van Tassel. Mostly well-received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman's Gothic score, the film won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction, as well as two BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. A box office success, ''Sleepy Hollow'' was also a turning point for Burton. Along with change in his personal life (separation from Lisa Marie), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' which, as Burton had repeatedly noted, was "not a remake" of the earlier film.

===''Tim Burton's Lost In Oz''===
{{main|Tim Burton's Lost In Oz}}
Conceived as an original television series based on the immortal works of L. Frank Baum, "Tim Burton's Lost In Oz" was never aired.  Though a pilot script was written by Trey Callaway with direct input from Burton as an executive producer and a number of key scenes were filmed by veteran television producer/director Michael Katleman, budgetary constraints ultimately prevented the project from being fully realized. Now being put onto film.

===''The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy: and Other Stories''===
{{main|The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy: and Other Stories}}
His book ''The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy: and Other Stories'' was published in 1996. The collection of verse is about misfit children such as ''Oyster Boy'', ''Match Girl'', ''[[Stainboy]]'' (which later became short animations), the Girl Who Turned into a Bed, and other such outcasts. The book was published by the publishing company Faber and Faber, which also published the original artwork of ''Sleepy Hollow'' in 1999.

==The 2000s==
===''Planet of the Apes''===
''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' was a commercial success, grossing -$68 million in its opening weekend. It was however panned by critics and widely considered inferior to the first adaptation of [[Planet of the Apes|the book]] . The main criticism was that the movie went for a more watered down "popcorn" feel than the dark, cerebral and nihilistic tone of the 1968 film. The film was a significant departure from Burton's usual style, and there was much subsequent debate about whether the film was really Burton's, or if he was just a "hired gun" who did what he was asked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/tim-burton|title=http://www.answers.com/topic/tim-burton}}</ref> Burton reportedly clashed with the studio during the whole making of the film, once going as far as abruptly leaving the set for the day. There were also many reports about last minute changes in the movie. Despite the commercial success of the movie and an ending that clearly suggested the possibility of a sequel, apparently there are no intentions from the studio or Burton to make another ''Apes'' movie.

===Recent Years===
Burton went on to direct ''[[Big Fish]]'' (2003) which received four [[Golden Globe]] nominations, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005) and ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005), for which he received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature Film]]. ''Charlie'' and ''Bride'' were Burton's most critically-praised movies in years. ''Charlie'' was a huge box office success that made over $207 million domestically alone.

===Future projects===
On June 13, 2006, Burton announced that he would be postponing his work on ''[[Believe It or Not (film)|Believe It or Not]]'' to concentrate on the [[Sweeney Todd (2007 film)|film adaptation]] of Stephen Sondheim's ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''. Burton's regular, [[Johnny Depp]], has been signed on to play the murderous barber. On June 19th, 2007 Burton announced that he was withdrawing from the ''Believe It or Not'' film.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

On February 5, 2007, Burton started principal production on ''Sweeney Todd'', from a screenplay by [[John Logan]]. The film stars Depp as Sweeney Todd, [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Mrs. Lovett, [[Alan Rickman]] as Judge Turpin, and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as Adolfo Pirelli.  [[Timothy Spall]] also plays Beadle Bamford. The Dreamworks/Warner Bros. production will be released on December 21, 2007 .

In November 2007, Burton signed a deal with Disney to direct two [[3-D films]]. The first will be a [[motion capture]] adaptation of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', which will finish filming by May 2008. Afterwards, he will remake ''[[Frankenweenie]]'' as a [[stop-motion]] film.<ref>{{cite news | author = Marc Graser | title = Burton, Disney team on 3D films | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[2007-11-15]] | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117976106.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>
Also he will direct [[The Spook's Apprentice]], which is about a teenage boy training to be an exorcist in the 1700's and must learn how to exorcise ghosts, contain witches, and bind boggarts.

His future project will be "[[Pain Killer (film)|Pain Killer]]", a psychological thriller set in the world of cutting-edge rock-and-roll. There may be a possible sequel to The Planet of the Apes that Tim might direct.

* Worked into the designs of many things seen on screen are elegant curls. The ends of lines often taper off into thin spirals at the ends. The most famous of these curls is the hill in ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''.
* Frequently uses the name "Edward". Examples include ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', ''[[Ed Wood]]'', and Ed Bloom ([[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Albert Finney]]) in ''[[Big Fish]]'',
* Distinctive skeleton motif seems to show influences from artist [[Edward Burra]] (http://www.tate.org.uk/collection/N/N05/N05005_9.jpg).
* Frequently works with actor [[Johnny Depp]]. The two collaborated in the films ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Corpse Bride]]'', and the upcoming ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]''. Burton wanted to cast Depp in his movie ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (in the role that eventually went to [[Michael J Fox]]).
* Frequently shows dead dogs, clowns, falling snow, black and white checkered floors, twisted trees, jack-o'-lanterns, scarecrows, striped snakes, butterflies, and [[Red hair|redheads]] in his films.
* Several films, such as ''[[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' and ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' are set at Christmas or during winter and feature the giving of presents.
*When presenting the film ''House of Wax'' with Vincent Price, he said his favorite scene was watching the wax figures melt and their eyeballs fall out in such a manner. He got to express that excitement when he directed ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. He also got to work with Vincent Price by casting him in ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''.
* His films frequently have dinner table scenes. See ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and ''[[Corpse Bride]]''.
* His films often have [[gothic fiction|gothic]] [[subtext]]s. See ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', ''[[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and ''[[Corpse Bride]]''.

''See also [[List of noted film producer and composer collaborations]]''.
* His main characters tend to be outsiders, and are usually shy, with a pale complexion and unruly black hair, similar to his own.
* A caricature of Burton appeared on the ''[[Plucky Duck]] Show'' episode "Return of Batduck". In the episode, the titular character hunts down Burton and attempts to score a role in ''[[Batman Returns]]''. Burton did not provide his voice for the episode; [[Maurice LaMarche]] (who, incidentally, provided the voice-over for [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]'s portrayal of [[Orson Welles]] in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'') took the role.
* Many of his characters are given a back story regarding their relationships with their fathers, often as a means of explaining erratic behavior. ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', ''[[Big Fish]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' are some prominent examples. Ironically, he has received some criticism for not delving enough into [[Bruce Wayne]]'s origins regarding his parents in ''[[Batman (1989 film)]]''.
