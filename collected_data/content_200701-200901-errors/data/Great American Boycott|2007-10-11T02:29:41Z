[[Image:Boycottflyer.png|thumb|300px|A flyer for the May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2006 Great American Boycott events in [[Los Angeles, California]].]]

The '''Great American Boycott''' (known in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as '''''El Gran Paro Estadounidense''''', "the Great American Strike") was a one-day [[boycott]] of [[United States]] schools and businesses by [[immigrants]], both legal and [[illegal immigration|non-legal]], of mostly [[Latin America]]n origin that took place on [[May 1]], [[2006]].  

This date was consciously chosen by boycott organizers to coincide with [[May Day]], the [[International Workers Day]] observed as a national holiday in Asia, most of Europe, and Mexico, but not officially recognized in the United States. 

As a continuation of the [[2006 U.S. immigration reform protests]], the organizers called for supporters to abstain from buying, selling, working, and attending school, in order to demonstrate through [[direct action]] the extent to which the labor obtained of unauthorized immigrants is needed for the [[economy of the United States]]. Supporters of the boycott rallied in major cities across the U.S. to demand general [[amnesty]] and legalization programs for such non-citizens. For this reason, the day is referred to as ''A Day Without an Immigrant'' in reference to the [[2004 in film|2004]] [[political satire]] [[film]] ''[[A Day Without a Mexican]]''. 

An early ABC News article dated May 1, estimated that over one million people participated in the demonstrations.<ref>{{cite news

While the economic effects are unknown, some initial reports indicated that, while the boycott failed to halt "business as usual", commerce slowed significantly in certain areas. According to the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, the boycott cost the Los Angeles economy $52 million, 4.3 percent of the normal $1.2 billion daily activity.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In a show of solidarity, internationally, [[Trade union|labor unions]] and other groups engaged in a one-day boycott of American products called the "'''Nothing [[Gringo]] Boycott'''", particularly in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]n countries.<ref>{{cite news

==Origin==
[[Image:SF Protest.jpg|thumb|300px|Protesters waving various flags in San Francisco]]

The boycott was announced on April 10, 2006 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] by the [[March 25 Coalition]] of Catholic groups, immigration advocacy organizations, and labor unions. Hermandad Mexicana, an affiliate of the [[Mexican American Political Association]], the [[Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles]] (CHIRLA), Amigos de Orange, and local [[MEChA]] chapters all promptly joined.<ref>Pacific News'' [http://news.pacificnews.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5640841981493b34b3d0933ac577adf5 "Groups Call for ‘A Day Without an Immigrant’"]</ref>

The coalition arose out of [[2006 U.S. immigration reform protests|protests]] against [[H.R. 4437]], a legislative proposal that was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] on [[December 16]], [[2005]] by a vote of 239 to 182, only to die in the [[United States Senate]] by not being brought to the floor before the 109th Congress ended. This bill would have made residing in the U.S. illegally a [[felony]] and imposed stiffer penalties on those who knowingly employ and harbour noncitizens illegally.  It also called for the construction of new border security fences along portions of the 2,000-mile [[United States–Mexico border]]. The coalition takes its name from the date of the first mass protest against the bill, a day which saw upwards of 500,000 demonstrators on the streets of Los Angeles, as well as hundreds of thousands in other major U.S. cities.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The March 25, 2006 protests were noted for their peaceful nature, despite the controversy surrounding the immigration issue.<ref> ''[[LA Times]]''[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-immig26mar26,0,7628611.story?coll=la-home-headlines "500,000 Pack Streets to Protest Immigration Bills"]</ref>

According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', {{cquote|The boycott grew from an idea hatched by a small band of [[Grassroots democracy|grass-roots]] advocates in Los Angeles, inspired by the [[Delano grape strike|farmworker movement]] of the 1960's led by [[Cesar Chavez]] and Bert Corona. Through the Internet and mass media catering to immigrants, they developed and tapped a network of union organizers, immigrant rights groups and others to spread the word and plan events tied to the boycott, timed to coincide with International Workers' Day.<ref>''New York Times'' [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/02/us/02immig.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&ei=5094&en=e9b7414ed9b65b5f&hp&ex=1146542400&partner=homepage "Immigrants Take to U.S. Streets in Show of Strength"]</ref>}}

==Initial response==
The boycott and strike provoked controversy as soon as they were proposed. National organizations and prominent figures split over whether to support the boycott, with many moderates endorsing demonstrations but withholding support for the boycott. Many of the "moderate" demonstrations were scheduled for three o'clock in the afternoon, after working-hours for the many unskilled professions where illegal immigrant labor tends to be concentrated.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] urged immigrants not to boycott, and instead to protest after work and on the weekend.<ref>''Los Angeles Times'' [http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-immig29apr29,1,6051484.story?ctrack=1&cset=true "Bush Asks Immigrants to Reject Work Boycotts"]</ref>

[[California]] [[List of Governors of California|governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] said a boycott would "hurt everyone".<ref>''Coos Bay Sun'' [http://www.theworldlink.com/articles/2006/05/01/news/news10050106.txt "Immigrants flex economic muscle with boycott"]</ref>
[[Image:May1_Mex_Flag.jpg|thumb|300px|Marchers in Los Angeles carrying a Mexican and American flag.]]

On [[April 27]], the [[California State Senate]] approved a measure to endorse a statewide economic and educational boycott. However, California's top education official opposed the boycott and called for students to stay in school on Monday. [[California Superintendent of Public Instruction]] [[Jack O'Connell]] also encouraged students interested in the immigration issue to voice their opinions after school.<ref>''San Jose Mercury News'' [http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/breaking_news/14444699.htm "State Senate endorses Monday's immigrant boycott; schools chief opposes it"]</ref>

Los Angeles [[Mayor of Los Angeles, California|Mayor]] [[Antonio Villaraigosa]], the city's first Mexican-American mayor since the 19th century, called for children to attend school and for a late afternoon rally.<ref>''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' [http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_3774092 "City's students absent in droves"]</ref> He also urged protesters to carry American flags, and not the flags of their home countries.<ref>''Coos Bay Sun'' [http://www.theworldlink.com/articles/2006/05/01/news/news10050106.txt "Immigrants flex economic muscle with boycott"]</ref>

The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] offered [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] as an alternative to boycotting, and suggested that churches toll their bells in memory of immigrants  who died trying to come to the U.S. The [[bishop]]s, too, urged students to stay in school.<ref>Fox News'' [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,193761,00.html "'A Day Without Immigrants'"]</ref>

National Hispanic and immigration-advocacy groups were also split, with some fearing that the actions would provoke a backlash. The [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], normally a moderate organization, was one of the few to fully support both the boycott and the strike.<ref>League of United Latin American Citizens [http://www.lulac.org/advocacy/press/2006/may1.html LULAC press release]</ref>

The [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund]] (MALDEF) took a cautious stand of discouraging truancy from school, and encouraging participants in the strike to "get pre-approval of a holiday or 'leave without pay' from […] work".<ref>Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund [http://www.maldef.org/news/press.cfm?ID=309&FromIndex=yes MALDEF press release]</ref>

The [[Washington, D.C.]]-based National Capital Immigration Coalition denounced the Boycott, while the [[National Council of La Raza]] took no position whatsoever.

Numerous [[anti-war]], [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], [[socialist]] and [[communist]] groups also endorsed the Boycott. The [[Act Now to Stop War and End Racism]] coalition, in particular, provided signs and mobilized supporters to attend demonstrations, and while the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] took no official stance, it offered advice and information for protesters on its website.<ref>American Civil Liberties Union [http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/gen/25251res20060421.html "Immigrant Marches / Marchas de los Inmigrantes"]</ref> The [[AFL-CIO]] also endorsed the protests, saying that the H.R. 4437 "isn't the answer" to immigration issues.<ref name="AFL-CIO">[http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/thisistheaflcio/outfront/immigrant_rights.cfm Why We Fight for Immigrant Rights]</ref> The AFL-CIO's executive vice president, [[Linda Chavez-Thompson]], stated: "We believe that there is absolutely no good reason why any immigrant who comes to this country prepared to work, to pay taxes, and to abide by our laws and rules should be relegated to this repressive, second-class guest worker status."<ref name="AFL CIO">[http://www.aflcio.org/mediacenter/prsptm/sp02282006.cfm Remarks by AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson at Immigration Press Briefing]</ref>

==Regional demonstrations==
Organization of events fell to local groups. In some cases, the split that occurred on the national level was evident on the local level as well in that separate events were planned by the various organizers. Major events were held in:

*'''[[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]''' - An estimated 2,500 protesters turned out for the event, although Atlanta police had been prepared for as many as 100,000.<ref>''WSB Radio'' [http://wsbradio.com/news/050106rally.html "Pro-Illegal Immigration Rally at Capitol"]</ref>

*'''[[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]''' - Authorities estimated that over 400,000 demonstrators marched downtown, while other groups put the figure as high as 800,000. Predominantly Latino schools in the city saw a 10 to 33 percent drop in attendance, which was as high as 85% in one school.<ref>''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' [http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-immigside02.html "85% of students absent at Farragut High"]</ref> 
[[Image:May 1 2006 Rally in Chicago.jpg|thumb|300px|A rally in Chicago]]

*'''[[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]''' - The Denver Police Department reported 75,000 people attended a march and rally.  Catholic groups were among the prime organizers.<ref>Archdiocese of Chicago [http://www.archdiocese-chgo.org/immigration/pdf/050106/flyer_050106_eng.pdf Flier]</ref>

*'''[[Inland Empire, California|Inland Empire]]''' Riverside police estimated that approximately 3000 people marched from [[UC Riverside]] to the steps of the county administrative building in downtown Riverside. 1500 people congregated outside San Bernardino City Hall and later marched throughout the city. Many area businesses closed for the day, schools across Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties saw extra absences and UC Riverside's cafeteria traffic dipped 20%.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ieprotest2may02,1,6182396.story "Marchers Crowd Inland Streets"] Los Angeles Times; May 2, 2006.</ref>

*'''[[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]''' - On the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and in Downtown, a procession of more than 10,000 walked [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] from the downtown [[Fremont Street Experience|Fremont Experience]] to Tropicana Avenue, a distance of about 5 miles.<ref>KLAS-TV [http://www.klastv.com/Global/story.asp?S=4851656&nav=168Y"Las Vegas Boycott Organizers Plan Next Move"]</ref> 

*'''[[Los Angeles]]''' - Between 1 and 2 million ([[Univision]] estimate) protesters marched in two separate marches,<ref>CNN [http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/01/immigrant.day/index.html "Thousands march for immigrant rights"]</ref> one beginning at 10:00 a.m. in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and primarily organized by the Mexican American Political Association,<ref>Mexican American Political Association [http://www.mapa.org/events.html Events]</ref> and the second beginning at 3:00 p.m. from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] down [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and organized by the "We Are America" coalition of religious groups including the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles]], ethnic interest groups, and labor organizations such as the [[Los Angeles County]] [[American Federation of Labor|Federation of Labor]], AFL-CIO.<ref>We Are America [http://todayweact.org/en/Media_Alert_-_April_26%2C_2006 "Thousands Unite on the Day of the Worker to Demand Just and Humane Immigration Reform: "We are America" Coalition leads action to Call on Congress to Enact Fair and Rational Immigration Reform"]</ref> The impact of the boycott was felt throughout the Latino community, and Southern California generally. Businesses were closed, traffic piled up for miles around the march route, and over 90% of the daily traffic out of the [[Port of Los Angeles]] was shut down.<ref>[http://la.indymedia.org/news/2006/05/155894.php "FROM E.LA TO OLVERA STREET NO BUSINESS AS USUAL"] Los Angeles IndyMedia; May 2, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://la.indymedia.org/news/2006/05/156164.php "Report back: Troqueros May Day strike shuts down port"] Los Angeles IndyMedia; May 4, 2006.</ref>

*'''[[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]''' - Between 3,000 (police estimate) and 5,000 (organizer estimate) people rallied at the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]].  The turnout was smaller than at a similar rally that brought at least 10,000 to the Capitol on April 10.  Organizers believe forecasts of rain, along with false rumors of [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] roundups that had caused panic in many Wisconsin communities the week before, may have contributed to the diminished attendance.  Hundreds of students did not show up for school and at least twelve businesses remained closed.  Some of those at the Capitol rally carried posters bearing a photo of Republican Congressman [[James Sensenbrenner]], the author of H.R. 4437 and a [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|Menomonee Falls]] resident, with red "X"-es drawn across his face.<ref>''Wisconsin State Journal'' [http://www.madison.com/wsj/mad/top/index.php?ntid=82278 "Thousands at Capitol support immigrants"]</ref>

*'''[[Massachusetts]]''' - Across Massachusetts, the boycott did not result in the widespread work stoppages that some organizers had hoped for. Its impact was felt most powerfully in Latino neighborhoods and among young people, with an estimated 8,000 students staying away from school and marching in the streets. Thousands of workers and their supporters joined rallies and demonstrations across the state. There was a teach-in at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], prayer vigils at Catholic churches, and rallies in the Boston area. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

*'''[[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]''' - Nearly 70,000 people participated in a march through downtown Milwaukee, according to an organizer estimate.  That number is more than double the estimated 30,000 who attended a similar event about five weeks before, on March 23.  Participants marched along Wisconsin Ave. until reaching Veteran's Park, the site of a rally at noon on the lakefront.  Mayor [[Tom Barrett (politician)|Tom Barrett]] addressed the ralliers, saying "Thank all of you for the fight you're fighting for peace and dignity.  You're showing Milwaukee and Wisconsin and the U.S. that the fight for justice can be done peacefully."  Wisconsin Restaurant Association president Ed Lump also spoke, emphasizing the importance of immigrants to the restaurant industry as workers, customers, managers, and entrepreneurs.  The crowd was littered with American flags and red, white, & blue signs--people who brought Mexican flags or those of other nations were urged to put them away during the march.  According to Christine Neumann-Ortiz, director of the event's main coordinator Voces de la Frontera, roughly 200 Milwaukee businesses remained closed for all or part of the day.<ref name=Milwaukee>''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'' [http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=420038 "A mass appeal for immigration reform"]</ref>

*'''[[New York City]]''' - A march of over 200,000 people began in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], rallied in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square Park]], and continued down [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] to Federal Plaza was led by a diverse coalition of workers' and immigrants' organizations. [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[Roger Toussaint]] were among the leaders of the march.<ref>''[[Village Voice]]'' [http://villagevoice.com/news/0618,ferguson,73086,2.html "A Day Without White People"]</ref> In a poll, the majority of New Yorkers believed that the protest would result in a backlash.<ref>ABC News [http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=local&id=4132072 "Immigrants turning out for nationwide boycott & day of protests"]</ref> However, very few stores closed for the boycott.  Organizers formed a [[human chain]]. In all, 12,000 people turned out to form eight chains: five in [[Manhattan]], one in [[Queens]], one in [[Brooklyn]] and one in the [[Bronx]].

Some Americans, particularly members and supporters of legal-immigration and immigration reduction groups, were alarmed{{Fact|date=February 2007}} by scenes of thousands of illegal immigrants marching through the streets and demanding laws be changed to legalize their presence in the United States. Some of these groups organized counter-demonstrations in various cities to coincide with the day's events, although they were mostly insignificant in size.<ref name=Milwaukee/> Some encouraged their members to buy from American businesses to offset the economic impact of the boycott. Among them are the Southern California [[talk radio]] hosts [[John and Ken]], who called for "The Great American Spend-a-Lot", a contest with prizes for listeners who spent the most money.<ref>John and Ken Show [http://www.johnandkenshow.com/archives/2006/04/28/the-great-american-spend-a-lot/ "The Great American Spend-a-lot"]</ref>

The volunteer border security [[Minuteman Project]], which has organized citizens' patrols along the Mexican border to monitor and deter illegal immigration, hosted rallies across the country, starting on Wednesday, May 3rd in Los Angeles.<ref>''Grand Forks Herald'' [http://www.grandforks.com/mld/grandforks/news/14461718.htm "Groups rally in Minneapolis for tighter immigration controls"]</ref> They also began constructing a six-foot high barbed wire fence along the border in Arizona.<ref>''Columbia Missourian'' [http://columbiamissourian.com/news/story.php?ID=19686 "Walkout by Latino immigrants set for today"]</ref> According to Minuteman Project founder [[Jim Gilchrist]], "It's intimidation when a million people march down main streets in our major cities under the Mexican flag. This will backfire."

A new group, the 'You Don't Speak For Us' coalition, was formed in response to the boycott to challenge the notion that May 1 protesters speak on behalf of all [[Latino]]s. According to former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Assistant Secretary of the Treasury]] Pete Nunez, who is the group's spokesperson, "Millions of Hispanic-Americans -- including many who have gone through the immigration process the right way -- are offended by the demands being made by people who have broken our nation's laws."<ref>Yahoo Business News [http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060426/dcw049.html?.v=49 "Illegal Aliens on the Streets 'Don't Speak for Us,' Says New Hispanic-American Coalition"]</ref>

Some political commentators, such as CNN's [[Lou Dobbs]], criticized the boycott for its promotion by groups such as the radical protest organization [[ANSWER]], (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism). Dobbs also suggested that the choice of [[May Day]] betrays a communist affiliation on the part of the organizers, although May Day is part of the whole of the socialist tradition and not only of the later communist movement.<ref>''CNN'' [http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/01/dobbs.immigrantprotests/index.html "Radical groups taking control of immigrant movement"]</ref> 

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' suggested that the [[May 2]] ouster of the mayor and two councilmembers in the town of [[Herndon, Virginia]] who had suffered criticism for their support of a day-labor center was a negative reaction to the Boycott.<ref>''Washington Post'' [http://www.washingtonpost.com./wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201805.html "Labor Site Backlash Felt at Polls In Herndon"]</ref> Some Southern and Western states drew up new tougher anti-immigration laws.<ref>''Washington Post'' [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201789.html "After Protests, Backlash Grows"]</ref>  The ''Post'' also credited backlash from the Boycott support in the [[Arizona legislature]] for the passage of laws penalizing businesses who hire illegal immigrants and on other crimes associated with illegal immigration.<ref>''Washington Post'' [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201728.html "Hill Impasse Spurs States to Tackle Illegal Immigration"]</ref> Georgia has also since passed a law, which will take effect in 2007, that prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving many social services and requires police and employers to report undocumented workers to the Immigration Service.<ref>''BBC News'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4921000.stm

According to an editorial by conservative commentator, [[Cinnamon Stillwell]] of the [[San Francisco Chronicle]], "The one thing the boycott did achieve was to expose the lie that the country cannot function without the labor of illegal immigrants. While some may have been inconvenienced by the experience, the economy hardly came to a grinding halt. It seems there are still some jobs Americans are willing to do."<ref>SFGate.com [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2006/05/10/cstillwell.DTL "The Day Without Immigrants Backfires"]</ref>

==Summary==
The Great American Boycott of 2006 galvanized the sentiments of millions of people living in the United States both legally and illegally and highlighted the extremely emotional issue of illegal immigration in America, motivating thousands to join demonstrations in protest of a new stricter immigration policy as well as invoking intense debate on all sides of the political spectrum.<ref>http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/may2006/immi-m02.shtml</ref>
