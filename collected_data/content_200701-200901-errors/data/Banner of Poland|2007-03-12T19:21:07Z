The '''banner of [[Poland]]''' was, for most of [[History of Poland|Poland's history]], one of the main symbols of the Polish State, normally reserved for use by the [[head of state]]. Although its design changed with time, it was generally a [[Banner#Heraldic banners|heraldic banner]], i.e. one based directly on the [[Coat of arms of Poland|national coat of arms]]: a crowned White Eagle in a red field (''[[Gules]] and eagle [[Argent]] crowned [[Or]]''). The banner should not be confused with the [[flag of Poland]], a white and red [[Gallery of bicolor flags|horizontal bicolor]], oficially adopted only in 1919. A banner of Poland is not mentioned in the current regulations on Polish national symbols.

The banner of Poland traces its origins to the early [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[vexilloid]]s known as ''stanice'' (pronounced: {{IPA|[sta'ɲit͡sɛ]}}; singular: ''stanica''), probably used at least as early [[10th century]] [[Common Era|CE]]. Although no specimens or images are preserved, a ''stanica'' was probably a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal edge attached to a wooden pole or [[spear]] and resembled the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[vexillum]]''. It was a religious as well as military symbol; during peace, the ''stanice'' were kept either inside or outside [[Slavic religion|pagan]] temples and taken to war as military insignia.

With Poland's conversion to [[Christianity]] in the late 10th century, the pagan ''stanice'' were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones, such as images of patron saints, the [[labarum]] or a dove symbolizing the [[Holy Spirit]]. In 1000, during his pilgrimage to the tomb of [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert]] in [[Gniezno]], the then capital of Poland ([[Congress of Gniezno]]), Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] officially recognized Duke [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus the Brave]] as King of Poland, crowning him and presenting with a copy of the [[Holy Lance]], also known as [[Saint Maurice]]'s Spear. The [[relic]], together with the ''vexillum'' attached to it, was probably the first insignia of the young Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of King Boleslaus's rule as well as his allegiance to the Emperor. It remains unknown what images, if any, were painted or embroidered on the ''vexillum''.

A royal banner was used as early as during the reign of [[Boleslaus II of Poland|Boleslaus the Generous]] (1076-1079). The earliest mention of the banner bearing the sing of an eagle is found [[Wincenty Kadłubek]]'s ''Chronicle'' which says that Duke [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir the Just]] fought the [[Ruthenians]] in 1182 "under the sign of the victorious eagle". A seal of Duke [[Premislaus II of Poland|Premislaus II]] from 1290 shows the ruler holding a banner emblazoned with a crowned eagle. Five years later, Premislaus was crowned King of Poland and made the crowned White Eagle a national coat of arms. During the reign of King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Ladislaus the Elbow-High]] (1320-1333), the red cloth with the White Eagle was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''chorągiew Królestwa Polskiego'').

The state banner was identical with that of [[Lesser Poland]], the territory where [[Kraków]], the  then Polish capital, is located. It was therefore carried by the Standard-bearer of Kraków until the office was replaced by the Great Standard-Bearer of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (Polish: ''[[chorąży]] wielki koronny'', [[Latin]]: ''vexillifer regni'').
