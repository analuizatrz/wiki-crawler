'''[[Royal Ordnance Factory]] (ROF) Elstow''' was one of sixteen [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]], [[World War II]], [[Filling Factories]]. It was a medium-sized filling factory, (Filling Factory No. 16), which filled and packed [[munition]]s. It was located south of the [[town]] of [[Bedford]], between the villages of [[Elstow]] and [[Wilstead]] in [[Bedfordshire]]. It was bounded on the northeast by the [[A6 road|A6]] and on the west by a railway line. [[Hostel]]s were built nearby to  accommodate the workers who were mostly [[Female roles in the World Wars|female]].

It was built with the [[Ministry of Works]] acting as [[wiktionary:agent|Agent]]s; building work started in November [[1940]] and was completed by August [[1941]]. It was managed as an "Agency Factory" by [[J. Lyons]] on behalf of the Ministry of Supply as, by then, the Ministry of Supply was overstretched in regards recruiting and managing the workers needed to staff these munitions factories.

It had 250 buildings and 15 miles of [[standard gauge]] railway lines. It was linked to the [[Midland Railway]] line running between [[London]] and Bedford.

== War-time Production ==
ROF Elstow started filling munitions in February [[1942]].

It was divided into a number of different filling ''Groups'' (see [[Filling Factories]]) which occupied different areas of the site. The Groups filled cartridges, high-explosive (HE) and 4,000-pound [[bomb]]s and [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. Later larger 8,000-pound, 12,000-pound and 22,000-pound bombs were also filled.

The [[Cordite]] Group opened in June [[1942]] and closed in May [[1943]]; it was then employed to recondition shells. The Pellet Group also closed in 1943. After 1943 Elstow was used to store surplus ammunition components and [[machine tools]].

== Closure ==
ROF Elstow closed in 1946. The [[CEGB]] took over the site in 1969 with the intention of building a [[power station]] but this never came to fruition.

In the early [[1980s]] Elstow was proposed as a site for a UK nuclear waste repository. In 2007 work began on the new town of [[Wixams]] on the site.
