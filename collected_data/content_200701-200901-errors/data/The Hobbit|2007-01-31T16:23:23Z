'''''The Hobbit''''' is a children's story written by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in the tradition of the [[fairy tale]]. It was first published on [[September 21]], [[1937]]. While it also stands in its own right, it is often seen as a prelude to Tolkien's monumental [[fantasy]] [[novel]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (published in 1954 and 1955).

The story, subtitled ''[[There and Back Again]]'', follows the adventures of the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] as he travels across the lands of [[Middle-earth]] with a band of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]] and a [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] named [[Gandalf]] on a quest to restore a dwarven kingdom and a great treasure stolen by the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]].

== Writing the story == 
In a [[1955]] letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects in the late 1920s, when he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]], he began ''The Hobbit'' when he was marking School Certificate papers. On the back of one of the papers, he wrote the words "In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit". He did not go any further than that at the time, although in the following years he drew up Thror's map, outlining the geography of the tale. It was eventually published when a family friend named Elaine Griffiths was shown a typescript of the story in the early 1930s. When she later went to work for George Allen & Unwin, she revealed the existence of the story to a staffmember named Susan Dagnall, who in turn asked Tolkien if she could look at the (still incomplete) manuscript. He complied and Ms. Dagnall, impressed by it, urged him to complete the book. Once this was done in late 1936, she then showed the book to Stanley Unwin, who then asked his son Rayner to review it. Rayner wrote such an enthusiastic review of the book that it was published by [[Allen & Unwin]].

Tolkien introduced or mentioned characters and places that figured prominently in his [[legendarium]], specifically [[Elrond]] and [[Gondolin]], along with elements from Germanic legend. But the decision that the events of ''The Hobbit'' could belong to the same universe as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' was made only after publication, when the publisher asked for a sequel and Tolkien began work on what would become ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

The novel draws on Tolkien's knowledge of historical languages and early European texts — many names and words derived from [[Norse mythology]], it makes use of [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[rune]]s, and is filled with information on calendars and moon phases, detailed geographical descriptions that fit well with the accompanying maps — attention to detail that would also be seen in Tolkien's later work.

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}
A hobbit named [[Bilbo Baggins]] is smoking on the front step of his comfortable hole one morning when [[Gandalf]] the Wizard passes by. They discuss the many meanings that Bilbo puts into the phrase "Good Morning", and the lack of adventurers in the neighbourhood. The thought of going on an adventure flusters Bilbo into offering one last "Good Morning", inviting Gandalf to tea the next day, and escaping back into his hole. An amused Gandalf scratches a secret mark on Bilbo's front door, which translated means 'Burglar wants a good job, plenty of excitement and reasonable reward'. The next day, thirteen dwarves ([[Thorin Oakenshield]], [[Óin]], [[Glóin]] ([[Gimli son of Glóin|Gimli's]] father in ''The Lord of the Rings),'' [[Dwalin]], [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]], [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], [[Bombur]], [[Fíli and Kíli]], [[Dori (Middle-earth)|Dori]], [[Nori (Middle-earth)|Nori]], and [[Ori]]) show up at the hole, along with Gandalf, and begin excitedly discussing their planned treasure hunt while the hapless Bilbo provides the obligatory hospitality. After the dwarves clean up their mess, a map is produced which shows the [[Lonely Mountain]] (Erebor) and environs; once ruled by Thorin's father (Thorin has rights to the treasure in the mountain), it was seized by the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]], who now lurks in its depths. The map shows a [[secret passage|secret door]] into the mountain, which the dwarves hope to use to defeat Smaug and reclaim their home. This, along with the fact that Bilbo's presence will break the unlucky number 13, is why the expedition needs a burglar. At first Bilbo wants nothing to do with the scheme, but then in a moment of anger and courage, commits to joining.

The next morning, after oversleeping and nearly missing the start of the journey, Bilbo goes off with the dwarves and the wizard. They are nearly eaten by three [[Troll (Middle-earth)|trolls]], but Gandalf tricks the trolls into staying up all night arguing on how to cook the company whereupon they are turned into stone by the first light of dawn. (The stone trolls appear later in ''The Lord of the Rings''.) In the trolls' cave they find a mound of stolen treasure, including elvish weapons. Bilbo acquires the dagger [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], which glows blue in the presence of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblins]].

The party travels to [[Rivendell]] where they enjoy the hospitality of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] and receive useful information and advice from Rivendell's master [[Elrond]], then proceed eastwards into the [[Misty Mountains]]. While seeking shelter from a storm, they are ambushed by Goblins and carried down under the mountains. Gandalf manages to free them, but during the escape Bilbo loses the dwarves. Alone in the dark, Bilbo finds a [[One Ring|ring]] on the floor of a cave passage and puts it into his pocket.

Continuing on, he finds himself at the shore of an underground lake. The creature [[Gollum]] paddles up in his boat, and the two enact a game of [[riddle]]s, under the condition that if Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out, but if he loses, Gollum will eat Bilbo. After several turns, Bilbo, whilst fiddling in his pocket unable to think of a riddle, asks himself aloud "What have I got in my pocket?" Gollum thinks this is supposed to be the next riddle, and while accepting it as legitimate, demands three guesses; despite taking four guesses, he fails to guess the answer. Bilbo demands his reward, but Gollum refuses and paddles off to the small island upon which he lives. There he searches for his most precious possession, a magic ring which turns its wearer invisible. Unable to find it, he belatedly realizes the answer to Bilbo's riddle, and goes storming back to the shore. Bilbo in turn realizes his life is in mortal danger and attempts to make his escape down the maze of pitch black tunnels. When Gollum gives chase, Bilbo trips and finds the ring slipping on his finger. Before Bilbo quite realizes what has happened, Gollum has run right past him. Quickly deducing the ring's power, Bilbo escapes past Gollum, who has gone to guard the only exit, and finds his way past the Goblins and to the surface where he rejoins the dwarves.

Descending from the [[Misty Mountains]], they are carried away from a deadly encounter with [[Warg]]s (wild wolf creatures) and Goblins by [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Giant Eagles]]. They then visit the home of [[Beorn]], an enormous and solitary man who can transform into a bear, where they rest and recuperate for several days before pushing on. At the edge of the black forest [[Mirkwood]], Gandalf departs on a private errand. The others enter the forest, travelling for days on end and eventually running out of supplies. Gandalf had warned them not to leave the path, but seeing fire and hearing singing, the group goes to beg food from [[Wood-elves]]. They promptly get lost and are captured by giant spiders, but Bilbo rescues the dwarves using the ring and Sting. Elves then capture the dwarves and imprison them, but an invisible Bilbo manages to sneak into the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]]'s palace unnoticed; he then helps the dwarves escape in food-barrels floated down the river which runs under the palace.

After spending more recovery-time at [[Laketown (Middle-earth)|Laketown]], the treasure-seekers proceed on to the Lonely Mountain. They locate the place where the secret entrance must be, but are unable to open it. As they sit despondent on the stoop, a [[thrush (bird)|thrush]] knocks at the snails on a nearby stone. Bilbo looks up to see the last rays of the Sun of [[Durin's Day]] shining on the cliff wall and magically revealing the lockhole for the secret door (as was foretold by [[moon letters]] upon the company's map.) Bilbo twice goes down to meet Smaug, who sleeps deep in the mountain on an enormous pile of treasure. The hobbit learns that the dragon has a bare patch on his left chest, and makes off with a large handled cup. The enraged dragon, while very puzzled by the existence of Bilbo, does correctly deduce that the Company received help from the people of Laketown and sets out to destroy the community. However, the thrush that had been knocking on the stone was no ordinary bird but one of an ancient race with whom the men of the lake could communicate, and it overhears Bilbo's report to the dwarves about Smaug's weak point. As the dragon ravages Laketown, the thrush conveys this message to one [[Bard the Bowman]], who seeing the bare patch on his left chest area of Smaug, dispatches the dragon with a heirloom of his family, a dwarf-made arrow. When Smaug does not return, the dwarves take possession of the Mountain and its treasure. While scouting the dragon's lair, Bilbo finds the prized [[Arkenstone]] and tucks it away in his possessions.

The citizens of Laketown arrive at the Mountain to make historical claims and demand compensation for the help they had rendered, as well as reparations for the damage Smaug inflicted during his attack. They are joined by the Elves, who also demand a share based on historical claims. The dwarves refuse all negotiations and in turn summon kin from the north to strengthen their position. Bilbo attempts to use the Arkenstone as ransom to head off a war, but the various parties are intransigent. Thorin expels Bilbo from the Mountain and a fight seems inevitable.

But suddenly Gandalf is standing on the battlefield, warning the various leaders that a new more dire threat has appeared: an army of Goblins and Wargs has come from the Misty Mountains. The dwarves, humans and elves immediately put aside their differences, and a bitter battle ensues, named the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Losses are heavy on all sides, but with the timely arrival and assistance of Beorn and the Giant Eagles, the anti-Goblin forces prevail. Thorin is among the casualties, but he lives long enough to part from Bilbo as friends. The treasure is apportioned fairly, but Bilbo refuses most of his contracted share of the riches, having no need for it and no way to get it home if he did; he nevertheless takes enough with him to make himself a wealthy hobbit and live happily thereafter.

<!-- unaware of the dangerous nature of his [[One Ring|ring]]. Which isn't dangerous at all in the story of The Hobbit. -->

== Joining ''The Hobbit'' to ''The Lord of the Rings'' ==

In the first edition, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle game. During the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'' Tolkien saw the need to revise this passage, in order to reflect his new concept of the [[One Ring]] and its powerful hold on Gollum. Tolkien tried many different passages in the chapter that would become chapter 2 of ''the Lord of the Rings'', "The Shadow of the Past". Eventually Tolkien decided a rewrite of ''The Hobbit'' was in order, and he sent a sample chapter of this rewrite ("Riddles in the Dark") to his publishers. Initially he heard nothing further, but when he was sent [[galley proof]]s of a new edition he learned to his surprise the new chapter had been incorporated as the result of a misunderstanding.

In the introduction of ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as inside "The Shadow of the Past", the differences of the first edition are explained as a "lie" that Bilbo made up because of the One Ring's influence on him, and which he originally wrote down in his book. Inside ''The Lord of the Rings'', Bilbo finally confesses the true story at the Council of [[Elrond]], although Gandalf had deduced the truth earlier. As Tolkien presented himself as the translator of the supposedly historic ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'', where Bilbo and Frodo's stories were recorded, he further explained the two differing stories in ''The Hobbit'' by stating he had originally used Bilbo's original story, but later retranslated the work with the "true story" recorded by Frodo.

This first edition also uses the word "[[gnome]]", which Tolkien in his earlier writing had used to refer to the second kindred of the [[High Elves]] – the [[Noldor]] (or "Deep Elves"). Tolkien thought that "gnome", being derived from the Greek ''gnosis'' (knowledge), was a good name for the Noldor he created to be the wisest of the other Elves. But with its English connotations of a small, secretive, and unattractive creature (see [[garden gnome]]) Tolkien removed it from later editions.

He made other minor changes in order to conform the narrative to events in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and in the ideas he was continually developing for the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]''.

=== Differences and inconsistencies ===
Even when revised, ''The Hobbit'' still does not fit seamlessly with the rest of Tolkien's world. It is so different in tone that it sometimes seems to belong in another universe from other Middle-earth works. Examples include the following:
* Bilbo has a clock, which may be an anachronism in ''The Lord of the Rings'' since this exact artifact is never seen. However, the most probable explanation of Bilbo's "obviously magical" gifts imported from [[Dale (Middle-earth)|Dale]] at the beginning of ''The Lord of the Rings'' is that they incorporate simple [[clockwork]]s,{{fact}} and the hobbits consistently tell time as hours "o'clock". Many artists such as [[John Howe]] prefer to omit the clock from their paintings nevertheless.
* Bilbo is said to have matches for his pipe. In the world of ''The Lord of the Rings'', matches are not mentioned and have apparently not yet been invented, since all use [[flint]]s.
* Like fairy-tale characters, the three trolls have English first names (Tom, Bert and Bill), and Bill has the English last name Huggins. Also, they speak fluent though vulgar English, while trolls in Tolkien's later works do not speak any English. This may be explained in-universe by treating the English text of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and other Middle-earth writings as translated from the original [[Westron]], the "Common Speech" used in many parts of Middle-earth, used by Bilbo and others in the ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]''. The trolls' vulgar English may be an attempt to preserve their crude Westron.
* There is lighthearted use of "magic"; Gandalf is said to have given the [[Old Took]] a pair of diamond studs that "fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered", and when Bilbo tries to steal a purse from the trolls, the purse shouts. Magic is never used so casually or frivolously in ''The Lord of the Rings'', and is more often an enhancement or corruption of natural phenomena.
* Elves sometimes appear silly or mischievous, singing light-hearted songs like ''Tra-la-la-lally''. In ''The Lord of the Rings'' while they are occasionally light-hearted in their relations with mortals, nonsense poetry appears to be beneath them.
* Addressing the reader, the narrator says that the history of Gollum is a mystery to him; he does not know "who he is or where he came from" however one sentence in the riddle game mentions Gollum remembering "other funny little people living in holes". Gollum was revealed to be a [[Stoor]] hobbit in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Of the One Ring, he only mentions that it was a "ring of power" that made the wearer invisible, except for a shaky and faint shadow when in full sunlight. Also, there was a "Master who ruled them", who is revealed to be [[Sauron]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''.
* [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] are still called [[Goblin]]s.
* Gandalf mentions his 'cousin' [[Radagast (Middle-earth)|Radagast]] to Beorn, though this may be for simple conversation's sake. It is alluded in ''Lord of the Rings'' and made explicit in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that the wizards are [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]] incarnate.
* There are extensive mentions (and a brief appearance) of mountain [[giants]]. Giants were never developed in Tolkien's other works, and they are not specifically mentioned again, although they may be alluded to in ''[[the Fellowship of the Ring]]'' as the Fellowship tries to cross the [[Redhorn Pass]]. They are also mentioned in ''[[The Two Towers]]'' as the in-universe builders of [[Helm's Deep]] and are discussed by Sam in the Green Dragon at the beginning of ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.
<!-- * The hobbits' "pipe-weed" which is also featured in ''The Lord of the Rings'' is explicitly referred to as "tobacco", a product of the New World which doesn't reasonably fit into Tolkien's "Ur-European" [[weltanschauung]] _Tolkien says in a Foreword to The Lord of the Rings that it was a "variety of Nicotania". It _is_ some species of tobacco; though Tolkien avoided using the term tobacco again, of course. -->

Many of these apparent inconsistencies only arise because Tolkien originally wrote the book as a children's story separate from his legendarium, and his concept of Middle Earth was to change and evolve throughout his life and writings.

Some of the differences in tone can be internally explained by accepting Bilbo as the author of the work, as was intended by Tolkien {{cn}}: Bilbo wrote the story of his journeys to recount them to the children of Hobbiton and therefore adapted the story somewhat. Apparent major differences such as the concept of the magic ring can also be explained by Bilbo's lack of knowledge of these matters at the time of his writing.

As told in "[[The Quest of Erebor]]" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Tolkien later had Gandalf say that Bilbo's account would have been very different, if ''he'' had written it instead. [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s biography of Tolkien also claims that when he had to revise the book, he had to restrain himself from rewriting it entirely.

=== Similarities to ''Beowulf'' ===

During his time as a professor at the [[University of Oxford]] Tolkien studied [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]]. One of the Anglo-Saxon pieces of literature he studied is the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', about which he wrote essays such as ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]''. Interesting parallels can be found between ''The Hobbit'' and ''Beowulf''.

The plots of the two stories have some similarities. In both of them a party sets out to seek satisfaction for a crime committed by a dragon. Both parties contain a thief, which in ''The Hobbit'' is Bilbo, who steals a cup from the sleeping dragon's hoard by using a secret passage. Both dragons then awake from their deep slumber and cause terror and destruction. Both dragons are well protected by their armour, but finally they are killed.
 
Additionally, some elements of Anglo-Saxon culture can be found. In both books a king, which in Anglo-Saxon sometimes is called ring- or gold-giver, rewards his warriors with treasure and war gear. In Anglo-Saxon culture, poems are important, as they contain the people's history and they are sung by [[scop]]s. Two such songs are found in ''Beowulf'' and more in ''The Hobbit''. Tolkien's dwarves mirror Anglo-Saxon society, both in their warrior nature and in their desire for jewellery and war gear (albeit in an exaggerated way). The dwarvish writing system as illustrated uses the Anglo-Saxon [[runic alphabet]]s. Both ''The Hobbit'' and ''Beowulf'' use [[mead]] as a drink of celebration.

In the [[annotated]] version of ''The Hobbit'', Tolkien claims that ''Beowulf'' was among his most valued sources, although it wasn't consciously present to the mind when he was writing it.

===''Bildungsroman''===
It has been suggested {{cn}} that ''The Hobbit'' can be read as a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' in which Bilbo matures from an initially insular, superficial, and rather ineffectual person, typical of most hobbits according to Tolkien, to one who is versatile, brave, self-sufficient. This happens through the conflicts he is involved in. He becomes relied-upon by others when they are in need of assistance. Some have read Bilbo's development as closely fitting the theoretical models of [[Joseph Campbell]] on [[mythology|myth]] and, in particular, the journey of the [[hero|epic hero]].

== Editions ==
[[Image:Hobbit cover.JPG|right|200px|thumb|200px|Dustcover of the first edition of ''The Hobbit''. This cover was designed by Tolkien himself, as was the binding illustrated at the top of this article.]]
George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' in September 1937. It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien himself. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by December due to enthusiastic reviews. Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York prepared an American edition to be released early in 1938 in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937. Despite the book's popularity, wartime conditions forced the London publisher to print small runs of the remaining two printings of the first edition.

As remarked above, Tolkien substantially revised ''The Hobbit'''s text describing Bilbo's dealings with Gollum in order to blend the story better into what ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had become. This revision became the second edition, published in 1951 in both UK and American editions. Slight corrections to the text have appeared in the third (1966) and fourth editions (1978).

New [[English-language editions of The Hobbit|English-language editions of ''The Hobbit'']] spring up often, despite the book's age, with at least fifty editions having been published to date. Each comes from a different publisher or bears distinctive cover art, internal art, or substantial changes in format. The text of each generally adheres to the Allen & Unwin edition extant at the time it is published.

The remarkable and enduring popularity of ''The Hobbit'' expresses itself in the collectors' market. The first printing of the first English language edition rarely sells for under $10,000 US dollars in any whole condition, and clean copies in original dust jackets signed by the author are routinely advertised for over $100,000. Online auction site [[eBay]] tends to define the market value for those who [[Early American editions of The Hobbit|collect ''The Hobbit'']].

[[Nicol Williamson]]'s abridged reading of the book was released on four [[LP record]]s in 1974 by [[Argo Records (UK)|Argo Records]].

[[Rob Inglis]] adapted and performed a one-man [[theatre]] play of ''The Hobbit''. This performance led to him being asked to read/perform the unabridged audiobook for ''The Lord of the Rings'' for [[Recorded Books]] in 1990. In 1991 he read the unabridged version of ''The Hobbit''.

===Comics===

A three part comic book adaptation with script by [[Chuck Dixon]] and Sean Deming and illustrated by David Wenzel was published by [[Eclipse Comics]] in 1989. A reprint collected in one volume was released by [[Del Rey Books]] in 2001.

===Games===

''The Hobbit'' has been the subject of several [[board games]], including "The Lonely Mountain" (1984) and "The Battle of Five Armies" (1984) as well as the almost eponymous "The Hobbit Adventure Boardgame" [[1997]] all from [[Iron Crown Enterprises]].

[[Games Workshop]] also released a "Battle of Five Armies" (2005) tabletop wargame using 10mm figures, based on their [[Warmaster]] rules.

Several [[computer and video games]], both official and unofficial, have been based on the story. One of the first was ''[[The Hobbit (video game)|The Hobbit]]'', an award winning (Golden Joystick Award for Strategy Game of the Year 1983) computer game developed in 1982 by Beam Software and published by [[Melbourne House]] for most computers available at the time, from the more popular computers such as the [[ZX Spectrum]], and the [[Commodore 64]], through to such esoteric computers as the [[Dragon 32/64|Dragon 32]] and [[Oric Atmos|Oric]] computers. By arrangement with publishers, a copy of the novel was included with each game sold.

[[Sierra Entertainment]] published ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 2003 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[personal computer|PCs]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox]], and [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]]. It is a [[platform game]] and is seen as more child-oriented than the contemporary [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] games: less brutal, fewer enemies and more simplistic graphics. A similar version of this game was also published for the [[Game Boy Advance]].

== Influences on other works==
<!-- [[Middle-earth]] has been featured in songs notably by [[Enya]] and the [[Brobdingnagian Bards]]. _Middle-earth in general or specifically The Hobbit? We need to distinguish. For more general works, there's "Works inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien". --> 

[[Led Zeppelin]]'s song "[[Misty Mountain Hop]]" contains references to The Hobbit, whilst other songs are thought to be influenced by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. "[[The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins]]", performed by [[Leonard Nimoy]] as part of his 1968 ''Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy'' album, is the most pertinent because it recounts the book's storyline in its two minutes. The ballad's [[music video]] became a minor [[List of Internet phenomena|Internet phenomenon]] in the early 2000s when ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy was released. Another well-known reference is [[Blind Guardian]]'s [[Somewhere Far Beyond|The Bard's Song: The Hobbit]]. A [[Trance music|trance]] track was released in 1995 by [[Dynamix Maniax]], featuring the title "Calling Middle-earth", containing a muffled sample from the 1977 [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated version of ''The Hobbit'']].

<!--Hiding this part for now; we need to filter the Hobbit-inspired stuff from the LOTR-inspired stuff. They're not the same. Nightfall in Middle-earth is about The Silmarillion! Sheesh...
