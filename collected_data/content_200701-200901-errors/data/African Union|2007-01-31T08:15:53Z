{{Life in the African Union}}
The '''African Union''' ('''AU''') is an organisation consisting of fifty-three [[Africa]]n [[state]]s. Established in 2001, the AU was formed as a successor to the amalgamated [[African Economic Community]] (AEC) and the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). Eventually, the AU aims to have a single currency and a single integrated defence force, as well as other institutions of state, including a cabinet for the AU Head of State. The purpose of the union is to help secure Africa's [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and a [[Economy of Africa|sustainable economy]], especially by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.

== Overview ==
The AU is governed by the [[Assembly of the African Union|AU Assembly of Heads of State]] and the [[Pan-African Parliament]], which are both assisted by the [[African Union Commission|AU Commission]] which constitutes one of the secretariats of the Pan African Parliament. The current President of the [[Pan African Parliament]], [[Gertrude Mongella]], is the Head of State of African Union. [[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]], president of the AU state of the [[Republic of the Congo]] is the Chair of the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government. [[Alpha Oumar Konare]] is the current Chairman of the African Union Commission, which serves as the Secretariat of the Pan African Parliament and a civil service of the African Union.

The AU covers the entire continent except for [[Morocco]], which opposes the membership of [[Western Sahara]] as the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]. However, Morocco has a special status within the AU and benefits from the services available to all AU states from the institutions of the AU, such as the [[African Development Bank]]. Moroccan delegates also participate at important AU functions, and negotiations continue to try to resolve the conflict with the [[Polisario Front]] in [[Tindouf]], [[Algeria]] and [[Free Zone (Western Sahara region)|parts of Western Sahara]].

The AU's first military intervention in a member state was the May 2003 deployment of a peacekeeping force of soldiers from [[South Africa]],  [[Ethiopia]], and [[Mozambique]] to [[Burundi]] to oversee the implementation of the various agreements. AU troops are also deployed in [[Sudan]] for peacekeeping in the [[Darfur conflict]]. In 1994 the OAU wasn't aware of the situation of the country and only provided some humanitarian help to the conflict.

== History of the African Union ==
The historical foundations of the African Union originated in the [[Union of African States]], an early [[confederation]] that was established by [[Kwame Nkrumah]] in the 1960s, as well as subsequent attempts to unite Africa, including the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), which was established on [[May 25]], [[1963]], and the [[African Economic Community]] in 1981. Critics argued that the OAU in particular did little to protect the rights and liberties of African citizens from their own political leaders, often dubbing it the "Dictators' Club". [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2115736.stm]

The idea of creating the AU was revived in the mid-1990s as a result of the efforts of the [[African Unification Front]]. The heads of state and government of the OAU issued the [[Sirte Declaration]] on [[September 9]], [[1999]], calling for the establishment of an African Union. The Declaration was followed by summits at [[Lomé]] in 2000, when the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]] was adopted, and at [[Lusaka]] in 2001, when the plan for the implementation of the African Union was adopted. 

The African Union was launched in [[Durban]] on [[July 9]], [[2002]], by its first president, [[South Africa]]n [[Thabo Mbeki]], at the first session of the Assembly of the African Union. The second session of the Assembly was in [[Maputo]] in 2003, and the third session in [[Addis Ababa]] on [[July 6]], [[2004]].

Its Constitutive Act declares that it shall "invite and encourage the full participation of the [[African diaspora]] as an important part of our Continent, in the building of the African Union". The African Union Government has defined the African diaspora as "consisting of people of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union".

====Morocco's withdrawal====
The only African state which is not a member of the African Union is [[Morocco]] which chose to leave the AU's predecessor, the OAU, in 1984 when the other African countries supported the [[Sahrawi]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[Polisario Front]]'s Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1428796.stm BBC News (July 8 2001) - "OAU considers Morocco readmission"] (accessed July 9, 2006).</ref><ref>[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/020709/2002070920.html Arabic News (July 9 2002) - "South African paper says Morocco should be one of the AU and NEPAD leaders"] (Accessed July 9, 2006)</ref> Some countries have since retracted their support for the Sahrawi Republic.<ref>[http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/politics/togo_confirms_to_au/view Togo confirms to AU withdrawal of recognition of SADR] (accessed July 9, 2006).</ref>

{{smaller|* Extraordinary meeting.}}

== Organisation ==
The current Head of State of the African Union is [[Gertrude Mongella]], who is also the President of the [[Pan African Parliament]]. The [[Chairman of the African Union]]'s Assembly of Heads of State is [[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]], and the [[African Union Chairman of the Commission|Chairman of the African Commission]] is [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]].

The African Union has a number of official bodies:
; [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) : To become the highest legislative body of the African Union. The seat of the PAP is at [[Midrand]], [[South Africa]]. The Parliament is composed of 265 elected representatives from all fifty-three AU states, and intended to provide popular and civil-society participation in the processes of democratic governance.

; [[Assembly of the African Union]] : Composed of heads of state and heads of government of AU states, the Assembly is currently the supreme governing body of the African Union. It is gradually devolving some of its decision-making powers to the Pan African Parliament. It meets once a year and makes its decisions by consensus or by a two-thirds majority.  The [[As of 2006|current]] Chairman of the Assembly is [[John Kufuor]], president of [[Ghana]].

; [[African Union Commission|African Commission]] : The [[secretariat]] of the African Union, composed of ten commissioners and supporting staff and headquartered in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]]. In a similar fashion to its [[European Union|European]] counterpart, the [[European Commission]], it is responsible for the administration and co-ordination of the AU's activities and meetings.

; [[African Court of Justice]] : To rule on [[human rights]] abuses in Africa. The court will consist of eleven judges elected by the Assembly. [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]] have expressed interest in hosting the court.

; [[Executive Council of the African Union|Executive Council]]: Composed of ministers designated by the governments of members states.  It decides on matters such as foreign trade, social security, food, agriculture and communications, is accountable to the Assembly, and prepares material for the Assembly to discuss and approve. 

; [[Permanent Representatives' Committee of the African Union|Permanent Representatives' Committee]] : Consisting of nominated permanent representatives of member states, the Committee prepares the work for the Executive Council. (European Union equivalent: the [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] (COREPER).

; [[Peace and Security Council]] : Proposed at the Lusaka Summit in 2001. It has fifteen members responsible for monitoring and intervening in conflicts, with an African force at its disposal. Similar in intent and operation to the [[Security Council]] of the [[United Nations]].

; [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council]] : An advisory organ composed of professional and civic representatives, similar to the European [[Economic and Social Council]].

; [[Specialised Technical Committees of the African Union|Specialised Technical Committees]] : These address Rural Economy and Agricultural Matters; Monetary and Financial Affairs; Trade, Customs, and Immigration Matters; Industry, Science and Technology, Energy, Natural Resources, and Environment; Transport, Communications, and Tourism; Health, Labour, and Social Affairs; Education, Culture, and Human Resources.

; Financial institutions : [[African Central Bank]], [[African Investment Bank]], [[African Monetary Fund]].

== Current issues ==
The AU faces many challenges, including health issues such as combating [[malaria]] and the [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]] epidemic; political issues such as confronting [[liberal democracy|undemocratic]] regimes and mediating in the many [[civil war]]s; economic issues such as improving the [[Human Development Index|standard of living]] of millions of [[poverty|impoverished]], uneducated Africans; ecological issues such as dealing with recurring [[famine]]s, [[desertification]], and lack of ecological [[sustainability]]; as well as the [[international law|legal]] issue of the still-unfinished [[decolonization]] of [[Western Sahara]].

In response to the ongoing [[Darfur conflict]] in [[Sudan]], the AU has [[African Union Mission in Sudan|deployed 7,000 peacekeepers]], many from [[Rwanda]], to [[Darfur]]. While a donor's conference in [[Addis Ababa]] in 2005 helped raise funds to sustain the peacekeepers through that year and into 2006, as of July 2006, the AU has said it will pull out at the end of September when its mandate expires.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5124608.stm] Critics of the AU peacekeepers, including Dr. [[Eric Reeves]], have said these forces are largely ineffective due to lack of funds, personnel, and expertise. Monitoring an area roughly the size of [[France]] has made it even more difficult to sustain an effective mission. In June 2006, the United States [[US Congress|Congress]] appropriated US$173 million for the AU force. Some, such as the [[Genocide Intervention Network]], have called for [[United Nations]] (UN) or [[NATO]] intervention to augment and/or replace the AU peacekeepers. The UN is currently considering deploying a force, though it would not likely enter the country until at least January, 2007.[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/MCD255466.htm]The under-funded and badly equipped AU mission expires on [[December 31]] [[2006]] but so far there is no agreement on what will happen after that date.[http://www.deepikaglobal.com/ENG4_sub.asp?ccode=ENG4&newscode=147406]

In response to the death of [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]], President of [[Togo]], on [[February 5]], [[2005]], AU leaders described the naming of his son [[Faure Gnassingbé]] the successor as a [[Coup d'état|military coup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4240485.stm |title=AU denounces Togo 'military coup' |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-02-06 |accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref> Togo's constitution calls for the speaker of parliament to succeed the president in the event of his death. By law, the parliament speaker must call national elections to choose a new president within sixty days. The AU's protest forced Gnassingbé to hold elections. Under heavy allegations of election fraud, he was officially elected President on [[May 4]], [[2005]].

Also, on [[August 3]], [[2005]] a coup occurred in [[Mauritania]] that led the African Union to suspend the country from all organisational activities. The Military Council that took control of Mauritania promised to hold elections within two years.

Current conflicts also include the [[Casamance Conflict]] in Senegal; the [[Ituri Conflict]], an extension of the [[Second Congo War]]; the [[Civil war in Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian Civil War]]; and the [[Somali Civil War]], associated with [[Somaliland]]'s claim for independence. There is still political fall-out from the [[Chadian-Sudanese conflict]], [[Second Sudanese Civil War|North-South Conflict in Sudan]], and the Ugandan conflict with the [[Lord's Resistance Army]]. Zimbabwe is also facing a political crisis.

However, the most serious issue to face Africa is not a dispute between nations, but rather the rapid spread of [[HIV]] and the [[AIDS]] pandemic. [[sub-Saharan Africa]] is by far the worst affected area in the world, and as the infection is now starting to claim lives by the millions. The epidemic has affected over 25% of the population of southern Africa, with South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe all expected to have a decrease in life expectancy by an average of 6.5 years. The effects on South Africa, which composes 30% of the AU's economy, threatens to significantly stunt GDP growth, and thus internal and external trade for the continent.

Controversy arose at the 2006 summit when Sudan announced a candidate for the AU's chairmanship.  Five member states threatened to withdraw support for a Sudanese candidate because of tensions over Darfur. Sudan ultimately withdrew its candidacy and Denis Sassou-Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo was elected to a one-year term.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of the African Union}}

== Languages ==
{{main|Languages of the African Union}}
The African Union promotes the use of [[African languages]] wherever possible in its official work. Its other working languages are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], although many other languages are used officially by some member states (e.g. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is co-official with French in [[Equatorial Guinea]].) Supplemental protocols to the African Union have made [[Swahili language|Swahili]] an official language of the African Union. Founded in 2001, the [[African Academy of Languages]] promotes the usage and perpetuation of African languages amongst African people.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the African Union}}

== Foreign relations ==
{{main|Foreign relations of the African Union}}

== Symbols ==
The [[emblem of the African Union]] consists of a [[gold]] ribbon bearing small interlocking [[red]] rings, from which palm leaves shoot up around an outer gold circle and an inner green circle, within which is a gold representation of Africa. The red interlinked rings stand for African solidarity and the blood shed for the liberation of Africa; the palm leaves, for peace; the gold, for Africa's wealth and bright future; the [[green]], for African hopes and aspirations. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn without internal borders.

The [[flag of the African Union]] bears a broad green horizontal stripe, a narrow band of gold, the emblem of the African Union at the centre of a broad white stripe, another narrow gold band and a final broad green stripe. Again, the green and gold symbolise Africa's hopes and aspirations as well as its wealth and bright future, and the white represents the purity of Africa's desire for friends throughout the world.

The African Union has adopted a new anthem, ''[[Let Us All Unite and Celebrate Together]]'', and has the chorus ''O sons and daughters of Africa, flesh of the sun and flesh of the sky, Let us make Africa the tree of life''.
